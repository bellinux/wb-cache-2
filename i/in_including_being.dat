40|$|I study a model where {{various kinds}} of people form {{partnerships}} with others. For instance, if {{these are people who}} work in teams, the kinds are external characteristics such as seniority, experience, and so on. Each kind of person has a set of possible “kinds of partnerships ” that he can partake <b>in</b> (<b>including</b> <b>being</b> alone). These specify the kinds of people that he can form a partnership with. He consumes a division of his availability among the kinds of partnerships that he can be a part of. A partnership allocation specifies a division of each person’s availability. Feasibility requires that the allocation be symmetric: if Ann, Bob, and Charlie are part of a partnership, then each of them consumes the same amount of that partnership. If the quantity of a partnership were measured in units of time, this would mean that if Ann spends two hours with Bob and Charlie then Bob spends two hours Ann and Charlie and Charlie spends two hours with Ann and Bob. Each person has a fixed availability and cannot be allocated more or less than that in total. There are two cases: In the first, along with partnerships, people con-sume another good such as money. In the second, partnerships are the only goods. For economies with money, I define a notion of competitive equilibrium and prove existence. Without money, I show that such equilibria may not exist. I then define and prove existence of an approximate competitive equi-librium. In either case, I show that equilibrium allocations have desirable welfare properties...|$|E
