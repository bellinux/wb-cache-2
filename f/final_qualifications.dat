2500|$|After the War Memorial Project, which {{erected a}} large {{memorial}} cenotaph in Lostock Hall, enough funds remained unused {{to launch the}} Lostock Hall Memorial Brass Band, though it took an additional donation of £100 for the band then known as [...] "Four Lane Ends Band" [...] to acquire instruments. During the early years, the band played {{for a number of}} local carnivals and church processions. [...] The band started to grow in capacity, as more and more players from other local bands started to join. [...] The band's solo euphonium, Ron Heyes, took over as conductor for the brass band in 1963, and took the band to many contests before his 1998 retirement as Musical Director, although he did take up the baton again from 2004 to 2006. Although at first the band did not show well, gradually it began to improve. Following subscription of many young players from local schools and colleges, the band qualified for the 1984 National Brass Band Finals at London's Royal Albert Hall. [...] Out of the 16 bands that participated in the finals, the Lostock Hall Memorial Band managed to finish a respectable 7th place. [...] This was to be followed with more <b>final</b> <b>qualifications</b> in 1995 and 2006. Several of the band players have moved onto other areas over the years, with some pursuing their musical careers by joining the HM Forces. 2008 represented a special year for the band as they celebrated their Diamond Jubilee, and also were crowned the 4th section National Champions at the Finals in Harrogate, playing Peter Yorke's [...] "The Shipbuilders" [...] under their current conductor, John Wood. The band have recently relaunched their website, www.lostockhallband.com.|$|E
60|$|There {{are many}} women in one {{position}} or another, among the hospitals, mostly as nurses here in Washington, and among the military stations; {{quite a number of}} them young ladies acting as volunteers. They are a help in certain ways, and deserve to be mention'd with respect. Then it remains to be distinctly said that few or no young ladies, under the irresistible conventions of society, answer the practical requirements of nurses for soldiers. Middle-aged or healthy and good condition'd elderly women, mothers of children, are always best. Many of the wounded must be handled. A hundred things which cannot be gainsay'd, must occur and must be done. The presence of a good middle-aged or elderly woman, the magnetic touch of hands, the expressive features of the mother, the silent soothing of her presence, her words, her knowledge and privileges arrived at only through having had children, are precious and <b>final</b> <b>qualifications.</b> It is a natural faculty that is required; it is not merely having a genteel young woman at a table in a ward. One of the finest nurses I met was a red-faced illiterate old Irish woman; I have seen her take the poor wasted naked boys so tenderly up in her arms. There are plenty of excellent clean old black women that would make tip-top nurses.|$|E
50|$|For 2012, the {{qualification}} {{rules were}} adjusted slightly. The host nation continued to receive three spots, {{as did the}} top eight teams at the World Championship.

The first stage for the full vocational route to qualifying is called the CILEx Level 3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice and is set at the equivalent to A-level law.

In the three years after the 1981 World Final at Wembley, international speedway's home in Great Britain had been the White City Stadium in London. However, with the closure of White City in 1985 a new home would be needed and the 30,000 capacity Odsal was chosen. A capacity crowd at the 1985 World Final saw a titanic fight between Denmark's defending World Champion Erik Gundersen, his fellow countryman Hans Nielsen, and American rider Sam Ermolenko. The trio all finished the meeting on 13 points each which saw a three-way runoff for the top 3 placings with Gundersen winning from Nielsen and Ermolenko. Just a month prior to the World Final, Odsal also hosted the Overseas Final as part of the World <b>Final</b> <b>qualifications.</b> That meeting saw two riders finish at the top on 14 points, American Shawn Moran and English favourite, Halifax Dukes rider Kenny Carter.
