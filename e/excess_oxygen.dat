40|$|This paper applies a {{feedforward}} control of optimal <b>oxygen</b> <b>excess</b> ratio that maximize net power (improve efficiency) of a NedStack P 8. 0 - 64 PEM {{fuel cell stack}} (FCS) system. Net powers profile {{as a function of}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>excess</b> ratio for some points of operation are analyzed by using FCS model. The relationships between stack current and the corresponding control input voltage that gives an optimal <b>oxygen</b> <b>excess</b> ratio are used to design a {{feedforward control}} scheme. The results of this scheme are compared to the results of a feedforward control using a constant <b>oxygen</b> <b>excess</b> ratio. Simulation results show that optimal <b>oxygen</b> <b>excess</b> ratio improves fuel cell performance compared to the results of constant <b>oxygen</b> <b>excess</b> ratio. The same procedures are performed experimentally for the FCS system. The behaviour of the net power of the fuel cell stack with respect to the variation of <b>oxygen</b> <b>excess</b> ratio is analyzed to obtain optimal values. Data of stack current and the corresponding voltage input to the compressor that gives optimal values of <b>oxygen</b> <b>excess</b> ratio are used to develop a feedforward control. Feedforward control based on constant and optimal <b>oxygen</b> <b>excess</b> ratio control, are implemented in the NedStack P 8. 0 - 64 PEM fuel cell stack system by using LabVIEW. Implementation results shows that optimal <b>oxygen</b> <b>excess</b> ratio control improves the fuel cell performance compared to the constant <b>oxygen</b> <b>excess</b> ratio control...|$|R

25|$|White Portland cement {{or white}} {{ordinary}} Portland cement (WOPC) {{is similar to}} ordinary, grey, Portland cement in all respects, except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this colour requires high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the clinker {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450°C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero <b>excess</b> <b>oxygen</b> at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|E

The nanowires having high <b>excess</b> of <b>oxygen</b> exhibit a brown-colour photoluminescence, due to the dominant emission band composed by violet, blue and green emissions. Those having more balanced Zn and O show a dominant green emission, giving rise to a green colour under UV light illumination. By O 2 -annealing treatment the violet luminescence after the band-edge emission UV peak can be enhanced for as-grown nanowires. However, the green emission shows different changing trends under O 2 -annealing treatment, associated with the <b>excess</b> of <b>oxygen</b> in the nanowires...|$|R

The oxidation of iodide causes slow loss of iodine content from iodised salts that are exposed to excess air. The alkali metal iodide salt, over time and exposure to <b>excess</b> <b>oxygen</b> and carbon dioxide, slowly oxidizes to metal carbonate and elemental iodine, which then evaporates. Potassium iodate is used to add iodine to some salts so that the iodine is not lost by oxidation. Dextrose or sodium thiosulfate are often added to iodized table salt to stabilize potassium iodide thus reducing loss of the volatile chemical.|$|E
