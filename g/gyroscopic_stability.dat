500|$|The {{practice}} of rifling—casting spiraling lines inside the cannon's barrel—was applied to artillery more frequently by 1855, as it gave cannon <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stability,</b> which improved their accuracy. One {{of the earliest}} rifled cannon was the Armstrong gun—also invented by William George Armstrong—which boasted significantly improved range, accuracy, and power than earlier weapons. The projectile fired from the Armstrong gun could reportedly pierce through a ship's side, and explode inside the enemy vessel, causing increased damage, and casualties. The British military adopted the Armstrong gun, and was impressed; the Duke of Cambridge even declared that it [...] "could do everything but speak." [...] Despite being significantly more advanced than its predecessors, the Armstrong gun was rejected soon after its integration, {{in favor of the}} muzzle-loading pieces that had been in use before. While both types of gun were effective against wooden ships, neither had the capability to pierce the armor of ironclads; due to reports of slight problems with the breeches of the Armstrong gun, and their higher cost, the older muzzle-loaders were selected to remain in service, instead. Realizing that iron was more difficult to pierce with breech-loaded cannon, Armstrong designed rifled muzzle-loading guns, which proved successful; The Times reported: [...] "even the fondest believers in the invulnerability of our present ironclads were obliged to confess that against such artillery, at such ranges, their plates and sides were almost as penetrable as wooden ships." ...|$|E

50|$|Flying discs (including Frisbees) can {{be thrown}} in many ways. Each throw {{involves}} snapping the wrist {{as well as}} flicking the arm to impart <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stability</b> to the disc and accelerate its mass to a certain velocity. Without spin, a disc will wobble and fall; without velocity, the disc will not go anywhere. Using these two guidelines, any number of throws are possible. Most discs are designed to create lift when thrown with the flat side up.|$|E
50|$|Wind also causes {{aerodynamic}} jump {{which is}} the vertical component of cross wind deflection caused by lateral (wind) impulses activated during free flight of a projectile or at or very near the muzzle leading to dynamic imbalance. The amount of aerodynamic jump is dependent on cross wind speed, the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stability</b> of the bullet at the muzzle and if the barrel twist is clockwise or anti-clockwise. Like the wind direction reversing the twist direction will reverse the aerodynamic jump direction.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the use of}} cup sabots {{of various}} {{complexity}} are popular with rifle ammunition hand-loaders, {{in order to achieve}} significantly higher muzzle velocity with a lower drag, smaller diameter and lighter bullet, successful saboted projectile design has to include the resulting bullet stability characteristics. For example, simply inserting a commercially available 5.56mm (.224) bullet into a sabot that will fire it from a commercially available 7.62mm (.300) barrel may result in that 5.56mm bullet failing to achieve sufficient <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stability</b> to fly accurately without tumbling. To achieve <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stability</b> of longer bullets in smaller diameter requires faster rifling. [...] Therefore, if a bullet requires at least 1 turn in 7 inch twist, (1:7 rifling), in 5.56mm, it will also require at least 1:7 rifling when saboted in 7.62mm. However, larger caliber commercial rifles generally don't need such fast twist rates; 1:10 being a readily available standard in 7.62mm. As a result, the twist rate of the larger barrel will dictate which smaller bullets can be fired with sufficient stability out of a sabot. In this example, using 1:10 rifling in 7.62mm restricts saboting to 5.56mm bullets that require 1:10 twist or slower, and this requirement will tend to restrict saboting to the shorter (and lighter) 5.56mm bullets.|$|E

Through variable reconstruction, the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is converted into a single-input single-output (SISO) system with complex coefficients. The pole locations law of the closed-loop system after the variable reconstruction has been revealed, and the controllability as well as observability of the controlled plants {{before and after the}} variable reconstruction has been studied too, and then the classical Nyquist stability criterion is extended to the complex-coefficient frequency domain. Combined with the rigid magnetically suspended rotor (MSR) system with heavy <b>gyroscopic</b> effects, corresponding <b>stability</b> criterion has been further developed. Compared with the existing methods, the developed criterion for the rigid MSR system not only accurately predicts the absolute stability of the different whirling modes, but also directly demonstrates their relative stability, which greatly simplifies the analysis, design, and debugging of the control system...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{theories of}} human motor skill are compared. Disagreements between them centre around the exact {{details of the}} feedback loops used for control. In order to throw some light on this problem a commonplace skill was analysed using computer techniques to both record and model the movement. Bicycle riding was chosen as an example because it places strict constraints on {{the freedom of the}} rider's actions and consequently allows a fairly simple model to be used. Given these constraints a faithful record of the delicate balancing movements of the handlebar must also be a record of the rider's actions in controlling the machine. An instrument pack, fitted with gyroscopic sensors and a handlebar potentiometer, recorded the roll, yaw and steering angle changes during free riding in digital form on a microcomputer disc. A discrete step computer model of the rider and machine was used to compare the output characteristic of various control systems with that of the experimental subjects. Since the normal bicycle design gives a measure of automatic stability {{it is not possible to}} tell how much of the handlebar movement is due to the rider and how much to the machine. Consequently a bicycle was constructed in which the <b>gyroscopic</b> and castor <b>stability</b> were removed. In order to reduce the number of sensory contributions the subjects were blindfolded. The recordings showed that the basic method of control was a combination of a continuous delayed repeat of the roll angle rate in the handle-bar channel, with short intermittent ballistic acceleration inputs to control angle of lean and consequently direction. A review of the relevant literature leads to the conclusion that the proposed control system is consistent with current physiological knowledge. Finally the bicycle control system discovered in the experiments is related to the theories of motor skills discussed in the second chapter...|$|R

Florine chose a co-rotating configuration because the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stability</b> of the rotors would not cancel. Therefore, the rotors had to be tilted slightly in opposite directions to counter torque. Using hingeless rotors and co-rotation also minimised the stress on the hull.

50|$|The {{basic motion}} is a forehanded sidearm movement. The discus is spun off {{the index finger}} or the middle finger of the {{throwing}} hand. In flight the disc spins clockwise when viewed from above for a right-handed thrower, and anticlockwise for a left-handed thrower. As well as achieving maximum momentum in the discus on throwing, the discus' distance is also determined by the trajectory the thrower imparts, {{as well as the}} aerodynamic behavior of the discus. Generally, throws into a moderate headwind achieve the maximum distance. Also, a faster-spinning discus imparts greater <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stability.</b> The technique of discus throwing is quite difficult to master and needs lots of experience to get right, thus most top throwers are 30 years old or more.|$|E

Further fine-tuning of the satellite’s orientation is performed by magnetorquers. These devices utilize generated magnetic fields from a current, which interact with the Earth’s magnetic field to orientate the satellite.

The M856 tracer should not be used in the M16A1 except under emergency conditions and only in relatively warm weather, because the M16A1's slower 1:12 rifling twist is not sufficient to properly stabilize this projectile at colder combat service temperatures (freezing down to -40 degrees), when the air density is much greater, disrupting the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stability</b> of the bullet.

50|$|On January 30, 2012, Sandia {{announced}} that it successfully test-fired a self-guided dart that can hit targets at 2000 m. The dart is 4 in long, has its center of gravity at the nose, and is made to be fired from a small-caliber smoothbore gun. It is kept straight in flight by four electromagnetically actuated fins encased in a plastic puller sabot that fall off when the dart leaves the bore. The dart cannot be fired from conventional rifled barrels because the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stability</b> provided by rifling grooves for regular bullets would prevent the self-guided bullet from reliably turning towards a target when in flight, so fins are responsible for stabilizing rather than spinning. A laser designator marks a target, which is tracked by the dart's optical sensor and 8-bit CPU. The guided projectile is kept cheap {{because it does not}} need an inertial measurement unit, since its small size allows it to make the fast corrections necessary without the aid of an IMU. The natural body frequency of the bullet is about 30 hertz, so corrections can be made 30 times per second in flight. Muzzle velocity with commercial gunpowder is 2400 ft/s (Mach 2.1), but military customized gunpowder can increase its speed and range. Computer modeling shows that a standard bullet would miss a target at 1000 m by 9.8 yd, while an equivalent guided bullet would hit within 8 in. Accuracy increases as distances get longer, since the bullet's motions settle more the longer it is in flight.|$|E
40|$|Part 1 of {{this paper}} {{describes}} a modification of the original Miller twist rule for computing gyroscopic bullet stability that is better suited to plastic-tipped bullets. The original Miller twist rule assumes a bullet of constant density, but it also works well for conventional copper (or gilding metal) jacketed lead bullets because the density of copper and lead are sufficiently close. However, the original Miller twist rule significantly underestimates the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stability</b> of plastic-tipped bullets, because the density of plastic is {{much lower than the}} density of copper and lead.

Part 2 describes experimental testing of this new formula on three plastic-tipped bullets.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects on}} aerodynamic drag of rifle bullets as the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stability</b> is lowered from 1. 3 to 1. 0. It {{is well known that}} a bullet can tumble for stability less than 1. 0. The Sierra Loading Manuals (4 th and 5 th Editions) have previously reported that ballistic coefficient decreases significantly as <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stability,</b> Sg, is lowered below 1. 3. These observations are further confirmed by experiments reported here. Measured ballistic coefficients were compared with gyroscopic stabilities computed using the Miller Twist Rule for nearly solid metal bullets with uniform density and computed using the Courtney-Miller formula for plastic-tipped bullets. The relationship between Sg and drag may be used to test the applicability of existing <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stability</b> formulas for given bullet designs and to evaluate the accuracy of alternate formulas in cases where the existing stability formulas are not as accurate. The most definitive test of formulas predicting stability will always be observation of whether bullets tumble under given conditions. However, observations of drag changes provide valuable supplemental information because they suggest changes in stability as conditions change. Use of a continuous variable (drag) rather than a binary variable (tumbling) allows insight into stability over a range of conditions where the binary variable does not change. Comment: 6 page...|$|E
