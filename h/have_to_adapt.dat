This latest novel is also a reflection about the evolution of our society and the so-called progress people <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>adapt.</b>|$|E
25|$|The new act, {{which came}} into {{effect for the}} school year 1994-95, has {{abolished}} {{the division of the}} subjects of arithmetic, mathematics, English, German, physics, and chemistry into basic and advanced level courses in the 8th to 10th forms, introducing a system of differentiated teaching, by which the teachers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> their teaching to the prerequisites of the individual pupil.|$|E
25|$|Women {{have higher}} levels of parental {{investment}} because they carry the developing child, and higher confidence in their maternity since they witness giving birth to the child. Hence women have reason to accept greater responsibility for raising their children. By comparison, males have no objective way of being certain that the child they are raising is biologically theirs. Because of this difference, males <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> their own sexual strategies to accommodate the strategies of the females around them.|$|E

25|$|The {{establishment}} of Israel and {{the flood of}} Jewish refugees from Europe and the Arab world presented challenges and opportunities for kibbutzim. The immigrant tide offered kibbutzim a chance to expand through new members and inexpensive labour, but it also meant that Ashkenazi kibbutzim would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> to Jews whose background was far different from their own. Until the 1950s, nearly all kibbutzniks were from Eastern Europe, culturally different from the Jews of Morocco, Tunisia, and Iraq. Many kibbutzim hired Mizrahi Jews as labourers but were less inclined to grant them membership.|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} forests arose on Earth, new niches for {{terrestrial}} animals were created. Spore-feeders {{and others who}} depended on plants and/or the animals living around them would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> too {{to make use of}} them. In a world with no flying animals, it would probably just be {{a matter of time before}} some arthropods who were living in the trees evolved paired structures with muscle attachments from their exoskeleton and used them for gliding, one pair on each segment. Further evolution in this direction would give bigger gliding structures on their thorax and gradually smaller ones on their abdomen. Their bodies would have become stiffer while thysanurans, which didn't evolve flight, kept their flexible abdomen.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a crisis}} arrived. The United States {{drastically}} reduced its immigrant quotas, causing shipping companies {{to lose a}} large part of their income and to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> to this circumstance. The Great Depression also played an important role, causing a drastic {{decrease in the number of}} people crossing the Atlantic and at the same time reducing the number of profitable transatlantic voyages. In response, shipping companies redirected many of their liners to a more profitable cruise service. In 1934, in the United Kingdom, Cunard Line and White Star Line were in very bad shape financially. Chancellor of the Exchequer Arthur Neville Chamberlain proposed to merge the two companies in order to solve their financial problems. The merger took place in 1934 and launched the construction of the Queen Mary while progressively sending their older ships to the scrapyard. The construction of a second ship, the Queen Elizabeth, was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the social}} constructivist approach, {{instructors}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> {{to the role of}} facilitators and not teachers (Bauersfeld, 1995). Whereas a teacher gives a didactic lecture that covers the subject matter, a facilitator helps the learner to get to his or her own understanding of the content. In the former scenario the learner plays a passive role and in the latter scenario the learner plays {{an active role in the}} learning process. The emphasis thus turns away from the instructor and the content, and towards the learner (Gamoran, Secada, & Marrett, 1998). This dramatic change of role implies that a facilitator needs to display a totally different set of skills than that of a teacher (Brownstein 2001). A teacher tells, a facilitator asks; a teacher lectures from the front, a facilitator supports from the back; a teacher gives answers according to a set curriculum, a facilitator provides guidelines and creates the environment for the learner to arrive at his or her own conclusions; a teacher mostly gives a monologue, a facilitator is in continuous dialogue with the learners (Rhodes and Bellamy, 1999). A facilitator should also be able to adapt the learning experience 'in mid-air' by taking the initiative to steer the learning experience to where the learners want to create value.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 15 February 1995, {{the final}} episode deals with plants {{that live in}} hostile environments. Attenborough visits Ellesmere Island, north of the Arctic Circle, to {{demonstrate}} that even {{in a place that}} is unconducive to life, it can be found. Algae and lichens grow in or on rock, and during summer, when the ice melts, flowers are much more apparent. However, they must remain close to the ground {{to stay out of the}} chilling wind. In the Tasmanian mountains, plants conserve heat by growing into 'cushions' that act as solar panels, with as many as a million individual shoots grouped together as one. Others, such as the lobelia in Mount Kenya, have a 'fur coat' of dense hairs on their leaves. The saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Desert flourishes because of its ability to retain vast amounts of water, which can't be lost through leaves because it has none. Many desert dwellers benefit from an accelerated life cycle, blooming rapidly within weeks after rainfall. Conversely, Mount Roraima is one of the wettest places on Earth. It is a huge sandstone plateau with high waterfalls and nutrients are continuously washed away, so plants <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> their diet if they are to survive. A bladderwort is shown invading a bromeliad. Inhabitants of lakes have other problems to contend with: those that dominate the surface will proliferate, and the Amazon water lily provides an apt illustration. Attenborough ends the series with an entreaty for the conservation of plant species.|$|E

The IPCC strongly emphasises that substantial climate change is inevitable, and we will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> to this. This should compel all of us — world leaders, businesses and individuals — towards action rather than the paralysis of fear. We need both to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases and to prepare for the impacts of climate change. Those who would claim otherwise can no longer use science as a basis for their argument." ...|$|E

[...] The empowered news audience {{with the advent of the}} Internet sparked the creation of blogs, podcasts and online news, independent of the traditional outlets, and [...] "for the first time in our history, the news increasingly is produced by companies outside journalism".

2500|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, batting is the act or skill of hitting the cricket ball with a cricket bat to score runs or prevent the loss of one's wicket. A player who is {{currently}} batting is denoted as a batsman, while the act of hitting the ball is called a shot or stroke. The term specialist batsman is also used generically to describe players who specialise in batting (as opposed to e.g. bowlers who specialise in bowling), and the term bowler is also used in this context. The latter term can, however, refer to any player during their turn at bat. In women's cricket, the term batswoman is sometimes encountered, as is batter, but the [...] "male" [...] form is widely used in both men's and women's cricket. Cricketers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> to various conditions when visiting international pitches; {{this is because the}} type of pitch usually changes. Therefore, batsmen have to also have a good sense of decision making.|$|E

2500|$|Furakawa {{stated that}} Ueda trusted him with freedom to compose {{the music and}} {{providing}} only a broad direction of a cinematic soundtrack and some specific directorial notes. While {{he was aware of}} the reputation of the soundtracks by Michiru Oshima and Kow Otani for Ico and Shadow, respectively, and wanted to have The Last Guardians soundtrack to be similarly unique, Furukawa opted to avoid using these previous works and instead drew his own inspirations primarily from works with a [...] "muted aesthetic", such as Impressionist art and music and French cinema. Furakawa wanted to avoid overstating the emotional aspect of the game, which he felt was already sufficiently conveyed through the gameplay and animation, and instead kept the music restrained except during key narrative elements or in specific locales of the game work. Furukawa did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> his score significantly to account for changes in story and game direction since these elements were still made within Ueda's vision. He worked with audio lead Tsubasa Ito frequently to review the status and use of his scored compositions.|$|E
2500|$|The marine chemist Scott Doney thinks [...] "the main {{tactics are}} raising energy efficiency, {{switching}} to renewable and nuclear power, protecting forests and exploring carbon sequestration technologies. Regionally, nutrient runoff to coastal waters not only creates dead zones but also amplifies acidification. The excess nutrients cause more phytoplankton to grow, {{and as they}} die the added CO2 from their decay acidifies the water. We have to be smarter about how we fertilize fields and lawns and treat livestock manure and sewage [...] Locally, acidic water could be buffered with limestone or chemical bases produced electrochemically from seawater and rocks. More practical may be protecting specific shellfish beds and aquaculture fisheries. Larval mollusks such as clams and oysters {{appear to be more}} susceptible to acidification than adults, and recycling old clamshells into the mud may help buffer pH and provide better substrate for larval attachment. The drop in ocean pH is expected to accelerate in coming decades, so marine ecosystems will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>adapt.</b> We can enhance their chances for success by reducing other insults such as water pollution and overfishing, making them better able to withstand some acidification while we transition away from a fossil-fuel energy economy." ...|$|E
2500|$|After turning {{professional}} in 1932, Nelson {{served as a}} club {{professional in}} Texas, and played as many significant tournaments as he could afford, to develop his game. Money was tight, as Texas was hit very hard by the Great Depression. A pair of top-three finishes in important Texas events encouraged him. He then took a club professional's job at the Ridgewood Country Club in New Jersey in 1935. He worked hard on his game, having earlier realized that with the technological change from hickory to steel shafts, which was gathering momentum in the early 1930s, that the golf swing would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> as well. Nelson {{was among the first}} {{of a new generation of}} players who developed a full swing with increased leg drive leading the downswing; this is the forerunner of modern golf technique as practiced by top players, right to the present day. Nelson is sometimes credited as being the father of the modern golf swing. He refined the changes for a couple of years, and then took his game to the highest level of competition, the PGA Tour. Nelson waited until 1935 to post his first significant victory, at the New Jersey State Open. He followed this up with a win at the Metropolitan Open the following year. He reportedly won this tournament with [...] "$5 in my pocket".|$|E
