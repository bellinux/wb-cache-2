40|$|It is {{essential}} that management and engineering understand {{the need for an}} availability requirement for the customer's space transportation system as it enables the meeting of his needs, goal, and objectives. There are three types of availability, e. g., operational availability, achieved <b>availability,</b> or <b>inherent</b> <b>availability.</b> The basic definition of availability is equal to the mean uptime divided by the sum of the mean uptime plus the mean downtime. The major difference is the inclusiveness of the functions within the mean downtime and the mean uptime. This paper will address tIe <b>inherent</b> <b>availability</b> which only addresses the mean downtime as that mean time to repair or the time to determine the failed article, remove it, install a replacement article and verify the functionality of the repaired system. The definitions of operational availability include the replacement hardware supply or maintenance delays and other non-design factors in the mean downtime. Also with <b>inherent</b> <b>availability</b> the mean uptime will only consider the mean time between failures (other availability definitions consider this as mean time between maintenance - preventive and corrective maintenance) that requires the repair of the system to be functional. It is also essential that management and engineering understand all influencing attributes relationships {{to each other and to}} the resultant <b>inherent</b> <b>availability</b> requirement. This visibility will provide the decision makers with the understanding necessary to place constraints on the design definition for the major drivers that will determine the <b>inherent</b> <b>availability,</b> safety, reliability, maintainability, and the life cycle cost of the fielded system provided the customer. This <b>inherent</b> <b>availability</b> requirement may be driven by the need to use a multiple launch approach to placing humans on the moon or the desire to control the number of spare parts required to support long stays in either orbit or on the surface of the moon or mars. It is the intent of this paper to provide the visibility of relationships of these major attribute drivers (variables) to each other and the resultant system <b>inherent</b> <b>availability,</b> but also provide the capability to bound the variables providing engineering the insight required to control the system's engineering solution.

40|$|Future space {{transportation}} architectures and designs must be affordable. Consequently, their Life Cycle Cost (LCC) must be controlled. For the LCC to be controlled, {{it is necessary}} to identify all the requirements and elements of the architecture {{at the beginning of the}} concept phase. Controlling LCC requires the establishment of the major operational cost drivers. Two of these major cost drivers are reliability and maintainability, in other words, the system's availability (responsiveness). Potential reasons that may drive the <b>inherent</b> <b>availability</b> requirement are the need to control the number of unique parts and the spare parts required to support the transportation system's operation. For more typical {{space transportation}} systems used to place satellites in space, the productivity of the system will drive the launch cost. This system productivity is the resultant output of the system availability. Availability is equal to the mean uptime divided by the sum of the mean uptime plus the mean downtime. Since many operational factors cannot be projected early in the definition phase, the focus will be on <b>inherent</b> <b>availability</b> which is equal to the mean time between a failure (MTBF) divided by the MTBF plus the mean time to repair (MTTR) the system. The MTBF is a function of reliability or the expected frequency of failures. When the system experiences failures the result is added operational flow time, parts consumption, and increased labor with an impact to responsiveness resulting in increased LCC. The other function of availability is the MTTR, or maintainability. In other words, how accessible is the failed hardware that requires replacement and what operational functions are required before and after change-out to make the system operable. This paper will describe how the MTTR can be equated to additional labor, additional operational flow time, and additional structural access capability, all of which drive up the LCC. A methodology will be presented that provides the decision makers with the understanding necessary to place constraints on the design definition. This methodology for the major drivers will determine the <b>inherent</b> <b>availability,</b> safety, reliability, maintainability, and the life cycle cost of the fielded system. This methodology will focus on the achievement of an affordable, responsive space transportation system. It is the intent of this paper to not only provide the visibility of the relationships of these major attribute drivers (variables) to each other and the resultant system <b>inherent</b> <b>availability,</b> but also to provide the capability to bound the variables, thus providing the insight required to control the system's engineering solution. An example of this visibility is the need to provide integration of similar discipline functions to allow control of the total parts count of the space transportation system.

The effect of the degassing plant on the environment is evaluated through a tracer release experiment using acetylene(C 2 H 2) as a trace gas to determine the change in emission {{as a result of}} installation of the degassing plant. This is used as a basis for modelling the VOC concentration distribution on the northern hemisphere using the DEHM model. The concentration data are subsequently used in a 1 -D RCM for modelling the change in radiative forcing {{as a result of the}} installation of the DONG degassing plant. The technical aspect is evaluated through a determination of the <b>inherent</b> <b>availability</b> and the energy-production relationship determined from production data. The economic aspect is evaluated through a cost-benefit analysis with stakeholders being respectively the users of the oil pipe and the society. Due to the small amount of measurements performed in the present project, the environmental effect of the installation of the DONG degassing plant remains inconclusive. Based on earlier measurements the modelling show a concentration change as a result of the change in emission of up to 10 ^- 4 ppm with the majority concentrated around Fredericia.

30|$|The {{authors of}} [20] {{proposed}} a cluster formation technique where nodes use the affinity propagation (AP) method to pass messages to one another. Basically, the proposed algorithm takes an input function of similarities, s(i, j), which reflects how well suited data point j {{is to be}} the exemplar of data point i. Nodes exchange two types of messages: responsibility, r(i, j), indicating how well suited j is to be i's exemplar, and availability, a(i,j), indicating the desire of j to be an exemplar to i. The nodes use the self responsibility, r(i, i), and self <b>availability</b> <b>a(i,</b> i), to reflect the accumulated evidence that node i is an exemplar. When a node's self responsibility and self availability become positive, that node becomes a cluster-head. The authors proposed that a clustering decision is made periodically every clustering interval (CI) period, and a clustering maintenance is performed in between CI. However, having cluster members make clustering decision every CI will increase the probability of re-clustering. Also the authors did not take into consideration the speed difference among neighboring nodes.|$|R

The code is based on a Monte Carlo simulation model of Semi-Markov process corresponded to the operational process of the mentioned facilities.

New technology has created affordances that both lessen the burden on human memory and facilitate access to a nearly infinite amount of knowledge. In six experiments, the current research sought to determine how increasing interactions with technology are affecting memory, and to identify the cognitive mechanisms that are driving those changes. Experiments 1 a, 1 b, and 2 implemented modified item-method directed forgetting paradigms to examine how future access to information affects subsequent memory. Results indicated that explicit information about future availability delivered as a post-stimulus cue did not impact memory, whereas memory was poorer for more readily available information when the <b>inherent</b> <b>availability</b> of the stimuli was manipulated. Experiment 3 delivered explicit availability as a pre-stimulus cue, and found that this change in timing resulted in poorer memory for information that was tagged as explicitly available in the future.

Experiment 5 implemented a list-method directed forgetting design, and corroborated findings from Experiment 3 indicating that an explicit availability pre-cue affected subsequent memory, whereas an analogous post-cue did not.

In this paper, we focus on contrasting costs faced by breast cancer patients in 2006 or 2007 (first full year of Part D implementation) to 2010 (fifth year of Part D implementation) and 2011 (first full year of <b>availability</b> of generic <b>AI</b> agents on CMS Website). Specifically, the state-specific mean monthly drug premium costs were computed for plans in each state. We report the median and range of the state-specific mean premium costs for each study year. Similarly, for the drug-specific costs, the mean costs were computed for each state, and we report the median and range of these state means.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{utilization}} of raw materials derived from renewable feedstock is in the spotlight of the chemical industry, as vegetable oils {{are one of the}} most important platform chemicals due to their universal <b>availability,</b> <b>inherent</b> biodegradability and low price. Taking into account that polyurethanes {{are one of the most}} important industrial products exhibiting versatile properties suitable for use in many fields, our research is focused on exploiting fatty acids in the preparation of biobased polyols and polyurethanes. This review is organized as a function of the nature of the final polyurethane systems; hence we describe the preparation of linear thermoplastic and crosslinked polyurethanes derived from oleic and undecylenic acids-based diols and polyols, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Vegetable oils {{are among}} the most {{promising}} renewable raw materials because of their ready <b>availability,</b> <b>inherent</b> biodegradability, and their many versatile applications. Vegetable oils are the fats and lipids containing triglyceride molecules. Due to the increase in environmental issues like waste disposal problems, non-biodegradable resources, greenhouse effect, etc. and the reduction of petroleum oil resources, renewable oils from vegetable origin have become an important issue. The lubricants from renewable resources are a successful reality {{in many parts of the}} world. Vegetable oils have many advantages such as high flash point, high viscosity index, high lubricity and low evaporative loss besides Eco-compatible, renewability and non-toxicity. This paper reviews the methods that are recently been practiced for the epoxidation of vegetable oils...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMobile {{social network}} (MoSoN) signifies an {{emerging}} {{area in the}} social computing research built {{on top of the}} mobile communications and wireless networking. It allows virtual community formation among like minded users to share data and to organize collaborative social activities at commonly agreed upon places and times. Such an activity scheduling in real-time is non-trivial as it requires tracing multiple users' profiles, preferences, and other spatio-temporal contexts, like location, and <b>availability.</b> <b>Inherent</b> conflicts among users regarding choices of places and time slots further complicates unanimous decision making. In this paper, we propose an autonomic system for activity scheduling in MoSoN communities. Our system allows flexible activity proposition while efficiently handling the user conflicts. As evident from our simulation and testbed results and analysis, our system can schedule multiple simultaneous activities in real-time while incurring low message and time cos...|$|R
40|$|Attitudes {{regarding}} traditional {{energy sources}} have shifted toward renewable resources. Specifically, short-rotation woody crop supply systems {{have become more}} prevalent for biomass and biofuel production. However, {{a number of factors}} such as environmental and <b>inherent</b> resource <b>availability</b> can limit tree production. Given the intensified demand for wood biomass production, forest and plantation management practices are focusing on increasing productivity. Fertilizer application, while generally one of the least expensive silvicultural tools, can become costly if application rates exceed nutrient uptake or demand of the trees especially if it does not result in additional biomass production. We investigated the effect of water and varying levels of nitrogen application (56, 112, and 224 kg?N?ha– 1 ?yr– 1) on nutrient content, resorption efficiency and proficiency, N:P and the relationship with ANPP, as well as leaf- and canopy-level nutrient use efficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium for Populus deltoides, Quercus pagoda, and Platanus occidentalis. P. deltoides and P. occidentalis reached their maximum nitrogen budget with the application of water suggesting old agricultural fields may have sufficient nutrient levels to sustain short-rotation woody crops negating the application of additional nitrogen for these two species. Additionally, for P. deltoides and Q. pagoda application of nitrogen appeared to increase the uptake of phosphorus however, resorption efficiency for these two species were more similar to studies conducted on nutrient poor sites. Nutrient resorption proficiency for all three nutrients and all three species were at levels below the highest rates of nitrogen application. These findings suggest maximum biomass production may not necessarily be tied to maximum nutrient application...|$|R
40|$|A {{socio-economic}} {{survey was conducted}} in three districts;- Kirinyaga, Rachuonyo and Nakuru within the Kenya highlands in February to May 2004. The objective {{of the study was}} to assess demand for breeding services of smallholder dairy farmers. The major constraints experienced by the respondents in this study were lack of adequate improved breeding facilities and the relatively high prices charged by the inseminators for the local and imported semen. Other constraints included the long distance to inseminators and service centres. Cost and <b>availability</b> of <b>AI</b> services were rated as major constraints by 51 % and 47 % respectively of the respondents. If resource-poor households are to continue to benefit from dairy production, a better understanding is required of the population, herd structures and dynamics in the smallholder sub-sector including the breeding (reproductive management and replacement) strategies of the smallholders. The majority of the smallholder dairy farms has few hectares and rear a small herd of less than ten heads of cattle. This calls for the need to intensify the farming system so as to obtain maximum yields. Before liberalization, the government of Kenya was solely involved in the management of Artificial Insemination (AI) services. However operational inefficiencies and budgetary constraints undermined service provision and AI services began to decline. In 1992, the sector was liberalized and the private sector stepped in to boost the AI service provision. However, with continued government involvement, tne - private sectors' performance has shown a downward trend in the past decade that needs to be studied to suggest policy recommendations. Investigations into what factors smallholder farmers put into consideration when choosing breeding bulls were also carried out. As ~ould be expected, farmers preferred bulls that are of high genetic quality (superior breeds), large body size and above all that are available. It was also found out that, faced with the problem of low quality bulls for breeding farmers had no room for choice and still used the low quality bulls that were easy to acces...|$|R
40|$|Diagnostic {{laboratory}} tests are routinely {{defined in terms}} of their sensitivity, specificity, and ease of use. But the actual clinical impact of a diagnostic test also depends on its availability and price. This is especially true in resource-limited settings such as sub-Saharan Africa. We present a first-of-its-kind report of diagnostic test types, availability, and prices in Kampala, Uganda. Test types (identity) and availability were based on menus and volumes obtained from clinical laboratories in late 2011 in Kampala using a standard questionnaire. As a measure of test availability, we used the <b>Availability</b> Index (<b>AI).</b> AI is the combined daily testing volumes of laboratories offering a given test, divided by the combined daily testing volumes of all laboratories in Kampala. Test prices were based on a sampling of prices collected in person and via telephone surveys in 2015. Test volumes and menus were obtained for 95 % (907 / 954) of laboratories in Kampala city. These 907 laboratories offered 100 different test types. The ten most commonly offered tests in decreasing order were Malaria, HCG, HIV serology, Syphilis, Typhoid, Urinalysis, Brucellosis, Stool Analysis, Glucose, and ABO/Rh. In terms of AI, the 100 tests clustered into three groups: high (12 tests), moderate (33 tests), and minimal (55 tests) availability. 50 % and 36 % of overall availability was provided through private and public laboratories, respectively. Point-of-care laboratories contributed 35 % to the <b>AI</b> of high <b>availability</b> tests, but only 6 % to the AI of the other tests. The mean price of the most commonly offered test types was $ 2. 62 (range $ 1. 83 -$ 3. 46). One hundred different laboratory test types were in use in Kampala in late 2011. Both public and private laboratories were critical to test availability. The tests offered in point-of-care laboratories tended to be the most available tests. Prices of the most common tests ranged from $ 1. 83 -$ 3. 46...|$|R
