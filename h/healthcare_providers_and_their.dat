40|$|Intellectual {{property}} {{protection in the}} form of secured patents has played an integral role in the growth and advancement of the biotechnology industry. The protection of intellectual properties is considered very important asset in this evolving industry. As a result, patent disputes often end up in the courts with long lasting consequences. Here we examined two recent and highly publicized patent dispute cases, namely, Mayo Collaborative Services et al. v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. (2012) and Association for Molecular Pathology et al. v. Myriad Genetics (2011), and wish to assess how the rulings will impact diagnostics and personalized medicine industries. In doing so, we learned that decisions involving patents are complex and interconnected, with previous court rulings influencing subsequent cases. It also became clear that in general, the biotechnology industry favored patent protection while <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> patients favored less stringent patent protection. The case is made by the biotechnology industry that the current system has allowed both the diagnostics and personalized medicine industries to flourish. Patents are a crucial incentive that not only promotes but also protects innovation. Any disruption on the legal front with regards to patents will have a negative effect. On the other hand, <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> patients voiced their concerns that the current system limits the affordability and accessibility of healthcare. Patent protected drugs are often expensive, making it difficult for some patients to afford. In addition, these drugs have no generic counterparts and are often without alternatives, limiting their accessibility. The providers and their patients argue that relaxing the current regulations is needed and that doing so will not impact innovation. It is believed that increased competition will have a two-fold effect—driving down prices and forcing innovation as a means of differentiation. In the end, the decisions themselves have provided little guidance regarding how the biotechnology industry should proceed, but this much is clear—a balance needs to be struck between the two opposing viewpoints for the biotech industry to survive and continue to grow...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if a complex intervention designed to support screening and brief intervention for problem alcohol use among people receiving opioid agonist treatment is feasible and acceptable to <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> patients in a primary care setting. Methods A randomised, controlled, pre-and-post design measured feasibility and acceptability of alcohol screening based on recruitment and retention rates among patients and practices. Efficacy was measured by screening and brief intervention rates and the proportion of patients with problem alcohol use. Results Of 149 practices that were invited, 19 (12. 8  %) agreed to participate. At follow up, 13 (81. 3  %) practices with 81 (62. 8  %) patients were retained. Alcohol screening rates in the intervention group were higher at follow up than in the control group (53  % versus 26  %) as were brief intervention rates (47  % versus 19  %). Four (18  %) people reduced their problem drinking (measured by AUDIT-C), compared to two (7  %) in the control group.

There are few research studies focusing on alcohol addiction treatment in Thailand. Objective: The purpose of the current study was to identify barriers to the treatment of alcohol addiction and to collect experts’ suggestions for improving treatment in Thailand. The Delphi technique was used to achieve consensual agreement among an expert panel within the field of alcohol addiction and treatment. Design: Three rounds of a Delphi survey were completed by a panel of experts in alcohol addiction, including physicians, nurses, social workers, psychologists, healthcare officers, and an Alcoholics Anonymous member. The open-ended answers provided by 34 experts in the first round resulted in 60 statements, which were later grouped into three themes. After three rounds of questionnaires, 51 statements were accepted as consensus. Results: Thirty-two experts participated in all three Delphi rounds. Over 80 % of participants were particularly concerned about five obstacles to alcohol addiction treatment. The majority of suggestions from the expert panel were related to patients’ right to treatment and the national policy for reducing the negative effects of alcohol. According to {{the results of the present}} study, the experts suggested that the treatment of alcohol addiction should be continuous from primary care to tertiary care, and convenient pathways should be established in healthcare services.

40|$|The {{advent of}} anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in Southern Africa holds {{the promise of}} {{shifting}} the experience of HIV toward that of a manageable chronic condition. However, this potential can only be realized when persons living with HIV are able to access services without barriers, which can include stigma. Our qualitative study explored experiences of persons living with disabilities (PWD) in Lusaka, Zambia who became HIV-positive (PWD/HIV+). We conducted interviews with 32 participants (21 PWD/HIV+ and 11 key informants {{working in the fields}} of HIV and/or disability). Inductive thematic analysis of interview transcripts was informed by narrative theory. Participants' accounts highlighted the central role of stigma experienced by PWD/HIV+, with stigmatizing attitudes closely linked to prevailing societal assumptions that PWD are asexual. Seeking diagnostic and treatment services for HIV was perceived as evidence of PWD being sexually active. Participants recounted that for PWD/HIV+, stigma was enacted in a variety of settings, including the queue for health services, <b>their</b> interactions with <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers,</b> <b>and</b> within <b>their</b> communities. Stigmatizing accounts told about PWD/HIV+ were described as having important consequences. Not only did participants recount stories of internalized stigma (with its damaging effects on self-perception), but also that negative experiences resulted in some PWD preferring to "die quietly at home" rather than being subjected to the stigmatizing gaze of others when attempting to access life-preserving ART. Participants recounted how experiences of stigma also affected their willingness to continue ART, their willingness to disclose their HIV status to others, as well as their social relations. However, participants also offered counter-stories, actively resisting stigmatizing accounts and portraying themselves as resilient and resourceful social actors. The study highlights a significant barrier to healthcare experienced by PWD/HIV+, with important implications for the future design and equitable delivery of HIV services in Zambia. Stigma importantly affects the abilities of PWD/HIV+ to manage their health conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of diabetes mellitus (both type 1 and type 2) is growing to epidemic proportions, with an expected combined worldwide prevalence of 220 {{million by the}} year 2010. A subsequent increase in the {{incidence of}} diabetes complications is likely to follow if present trends continue, placing an increased burden on already troubled healthcare systems. While there are many identified biologic mechanisms for the development of diabetes complications, there has been little exploration of <b>healthcare</b> <b>provider</b> issues <b>and</b> <b>their</b> contribution to these outcomes. One area of research with few data is the influence of diabetes specialty care on outcomes in type 1 diabetic patients. Evidence demonstrates that both process delivery and outcomes are better in individuals with type 1 diabetes who are cared for by diabetes specialists compared with generalists. For example, those receiving care from diabetes specialists were more likely to receive diabetes education, to be treated with intensive insulin therapy (> 2 injections/day), and to receive an eye examination compared with those receiving generalist care. Additionally, lower rates of proliferative retinopathy were observed in those receiving specialist care. Recent evidence also demonstrates that there are lower incidences of neuropathy, overt nephropathy, and coronary artery disease in those patients who spend a higher proportion of the duration of their diabetes in specialist care. Based on these observations, it is recommended that attempts be made to replicate the favorable characteristics of specialty care in the primary care setting. Healthcare systems should ensure the availability of access to diabetes specialists, as well as ancillary healthcare professionals including diabetes educators, with increased emphasis placed on coordinated care.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} provide {{insights}} into Australian women 2 ̆ 7 s experiences in gaining nutrition information during pregnancy. Individual semistructured telephone {{interviews were conducted}} with 17 pregnant (across all trimesters) and 9 postpartum women in five Australian states. Data were transcribed and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Women valued nutrition information, actively sought it, and passively received it mainly from three sources: <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> (HCPs), media, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> social networks. Women reported HCPs as highest for reliability but they had limited time and indifferent approaches. Various media were easily and most frequently accessed but were less reliable. Social networks were considered to be the least reliable and least accessed. Women reported becoming overwhelmed and confused. This in turn influenced <b>their</b> decisions (pragmatic/rational) <b>and</b> <b>their</b> eating behaviours (2 ̆ 2 overdo it, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 loosen it, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 ignore it, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 positive response 2 ̆ 2). Individual and environmental barriers impacted their application of knowledge to dietary practice. Women wanted more constructive and interactive engagement with their HCPs. This study identified the need to establish and maintain mutually respectful environments where women feel able to raise issues with their HCPs throughout <b>their</b> pregnancies <b>and</b> where they are confident that the information they receive will be accurate <b>and</b> meet <b>their</b> needs...|$|R
