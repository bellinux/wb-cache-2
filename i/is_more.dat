50|$|While there {{tended to}} <b>be</b> <b>more</b> singlewomen in {{northern}} Europe than in southern Europe, there <b>were</b> also <b>more</b> singlewomen in {{towns and cities}} than in the countryside. This phenomenon is likely {{due to the fact}} that there <b>were</b> <b>more</b> opportunities for female employment in urban areas. Singlewomen may have <b>been</b> much <b>more</b> prevalent in cities because sex ratios <b>were</b> <b>more</b> equal in rural areas. As there tended to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> women than men in urban areas, lifelong singlewomen <b>were</b> often <b>more</b> abundant in urban areas.|$|R
50|$|Mules are {{preferred}} {{because they}} <b>are</b> <b>more</b> tolerant to heat than horses. Horses <b>are</b> <b>more</b> efficient {{in cold weather}} and mules <b>are</b> <b>more</b> effective in deserts. Horses <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to suffer from}} exhaustion when compared to mules. Since mules are relatively slower than horses they are much safer to ride than horses. It is cheaper to rear a mule than a horse because they consume less. Lastly, mules <b>are</b> <b>more</b> enduring than a horse and can live longer.|$|R

5|$|Early work on {{the study}} of the {{chemistry}} of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work <b>is</b> <b>more</b> reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies. The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride <b>is</b> <b>more</b> volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its bonds are more covalent.|$|E
50|$|Children who <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to}} <b>be</b> abused often display {{characteristics}} of being difficult for workers {{to deal with}} and needing more one-on-one supervision, isolation from their family, and previous victims of abuse.

5|$|Ecological {{systems are}} studied at several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} the ecology of individual organisms, to those of populations, to the ecosystems and finally the biosphere.

Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.|$|E
