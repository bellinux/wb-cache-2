The neurons of the skin and muscles that are responsive to pressure and vibration have <b>filtering</b> <b>accessory</b> structures that aid their function.|$|R

40|$|Most photographers have at {{one time}} of another run into a {{situation}} where the filter thread ring {{on the front of the}} lens has been bent in some accident and now there is a need to attach a certain <b>filter</b> or <b>accessory</b> to the lens 2 ̆ 7 s filter threads. Here is a guide to one solution. Added here in April 2008...|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} size of {{an internal}} focusing lens does not change during focus, nor does {{the front of the}} lens rotate. This is particularly useful for large lenses, keeping the size more compact, or when using <b>filters</b> or <b>accessories</b> mounted {{on the front of the}} lens that may require careful alignment.One issue internal focusing lens can have is that the true focal length of the lens is reduced when not focused at infinity.|$|R
50|$|While {{these are}} not {{technically}} <b>filters</b> but <b>accessory</b> lenses, they are sold by filter manufacturers {{as part of their}} product lines, using the same holders and attachment systems. A close-up lens is a single or two-element converging lens used for close-up and macro photography, and works {{in the same way as}} spectacles used for reading. The insertion of a converging lens in front of the taking lens reduces the focal length of the combination.|$|R
5000|$|Spira {{was also}} at the [...] "forefront" [...] of the {{technological}} revolution in lens attachments having developed a variety of <b>filters</b> and lens <b>accessories</b> that added unusual and special effects to photographs, and was [...] "the most important" [...] supplier of such attachments.|$|R
5000|$|Eheim GmbH & Co. KG is a German company {{founded by}} Gunther Eheim, {{operating}} {{in the domain of}} aquariums and aquarium accessories. It manufactures different kinds of water filters (internal and external) and the associated <b>filter</b> media, pumps, <b>accessories</b> such as aquarium fish feeders, gravel cleaners and garden ponds, while its subsidiaries MP (Mueller and Pfleger) manufacture aquariums and Jäger, aquarium heaters.|$|R
500|$|Open sights (also {{known as}} [...] "mini reflex sights" [...] and [...] "mini red dots") take {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} reflector sight's only optical element, the optical window, doesn't need any housing at all. This configuration consists of a base with just the necessary reflective surface for collimating the reticle mounted on it. Due to their diminished profile, open sights do not usually accommodate <b>filters</b> and other <b>accessory</b> options typically supported by tube designs.|$|R
50|$|A monitor <b>filter</b> is an <b>accessory</b> to the {{computer}} display to filter out the light reflected from the smooth glass surface of a CRT or flat screen display {{as well as the}} radiation emitted from CRT and LCD displays. Many also include a ground to dissipate static buildup. A secondary use for monitor filters is privacy as they decrease the viewing angle of a monitor, preventing it from being viewed from the side; in this case, they are also called privacy screens.|$|R
5000|$|The January 2010 {{issue of}} Hot Rod {{reported}} {{a project in}} which a Boss 351 was assembled to the exact internal specifications of an original motor, but fitted with open, long tube, 1-3/4-inch Hooker headers (vs. the stock cast-iron manifolds), a facility water pump, a 750 Holley Street HP-series carburetor (vs. the stock 715 CFM Autolite unit), and minus the factory air <b>filter</b> assembly, engine <b>accessories,</b> or factory exhaust system. In that mildly modified state, it produced [...] gross at 6,100 rpm, and 391 lbft Nm torque (gross) at 4,000 rpm. [...] A measurement of SAE net horsepower would be significantly lower, and represents a more realistic as-installed configuration with all engine accessories, air cleaner assembly, and automobile exhaust system.|$|R
40|$|Three {{filtration}} systems {{using the}} tractor hydraulic circuit were proposed and verified during the tractors operation. Using the tractor-implement hydraulic system and <b>filter</b> body with <b>accessories</b> the universally useful filtration systems were designed. The designed filtration systems are {{the second stage}} of universal oil filtration whereas the first stage is the standard tractor filter. The decrease in the content of iron reached the values 25. 53 %, 32. 95 % and 41. 55 % and the average decrease in oil contamination characterized by average value of decrease in content of iron, copper and silicium reached values 24. 3 %, 24. 7 % and 35. 53 % in dependence on the filtration system and an oil contamination level. The decrease in contamination level verified the ability of designed filtration systems for agricultural tractors...|$|R
