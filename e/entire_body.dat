5|$|The California {{spiny lobster}} can be {{differentiated}} {{from the other}} species in the genus by the interrupted grooves across the abdomen; other species either lack grooves, or have grooves which span the <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> segment.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 1951, Lacks, who was 31 years old, went to Johns Hopkins for {{a routine}} {{treatment}} session {{and asked to}} be admitted due to continued severe abdominal pain. She received blood transfusions and remained at the hospital until her death on October 4, 1951. A partial autopsy showed that the cancer had metastasized throughout her <b>entire</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{more general}} term for an {{abnormal}} or degenerative {{condition of the}} <b>entire</b> <b>body's</b> adipose tissue is lipodystrophy.|$|R
5|$|While {{previous}} games {{used only}} a simple life bar, Snake Eater also {{keeps track of}} injuries over the <b>entire</b> <b>body.</b> For example, a long fall could fracture Snake's leg, slowing him down until the injury is properly treated with a splint and bandage. Unless these injuries are treated, Snake {{will not be able}} to fully recover his health for some time.|$|E
5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
5|$|I've {{never had}} chills through my <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> like I had from hearing Beyoncé sing this song. 'I Was Here' came from my soul {{and became the}} song that was coming from hers. In all my life, I have never heard {{anything}} as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever {{be one of the}} best moments of my life, and I know that this song will touch many other lives as well.|$|E

5000|$|The Panotti (also Panotii and Panotioi, {{from the}} Greek words [...] and [...] for [...] "all ears") were a mythical race of people, {{described}} as possessing large ears that covered their <b>entire</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a tingling sensation. Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the <b>entire</b> <b>body.</b> Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E
5|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended on it with the <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the reverse slope of the ridge, {{out of sight of the}} rest of the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Salih quickly {{gained the}} {{allegiance}} of the <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> of Kilab, {{who were in}} awe of his escape, and moved against Aleppo. Mansur's ghilmān staved off Salih's forces at Aleppo's outskirts, encouraging Mansur to assemble a larger army composed of his ghilmān, craftsmen from the suq and men from Aleppo's lower-class neighborhoods, including many Christians and Jews. On 13 August, Salih routed the Aleppine force, killing some 2,000 of Mansur's soldiers, and capturing Mansur and his senior commanders.|$|E
25|$|Flies and {{butterflies}} have taste organs on their feet, {{allowing them to}} taste anything they land on. Catfish have taste organs across their <b>entire</b> <b>bodies,</b> and can taste anything they touch, including chemicals in the water.|$|R
2500|$|They dive {{below the}} surface only when disturbed. Larvae swim either through {{propulsion}} with their mouth brushes, or by jerky movements of their <b>entire</b> <b>bodies,</b> giving them the common name of [...] "wigglers" [...] or [...] "wrigglers".|$|R
50|$|Many Megasoma species (Megasoma elephas, Megasoma thersites, Megasoma gyas, Megasoma cedrosa, Megasoma anubis, Megasoma occidentalis, Megasoma joergenseni, Megasoma vogti) have thin {{microscopic}} hairs (setae) covering nearly their <b>entire</b> <b>bodies,</b> {{giving the}} appearance of being pale or orange.|$|R
5|$|The left {{ventricle}} is much thicker {{as compared with}} the right, due to the greater force needed to pump blood to the <b>entire</b> <b>body.</b> Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The {{left ventricle}} pumps blood to the body through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry blood to the heart itself, the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery.|$|E
5|$|The panniculus carnosus is a {{layer of}} {{striated}} muscle deep to the panniculus adiposus. Although absent in hominoids, the panniculus carnosus is common in non-hominoid primates and non-primate mammals. In lower mammals {{the area of the}} panniculus carnosus can be extensive, almost covering the <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> {{in the case of the}} short-beaked echidna. Several human muscles are considered discrete muscles originating from the panniculus carnosus, and some researchers classify the axillary arch as a sporadic vestigial muscle of this type.|$|E
5|$|The {{rest of the}} National Constituent Assembly {{followed}} the king within two weeks to new quarters in Paris. In short order, the <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> settled {{in only a few}} steps from the Tuileries at a former riding school, the Salle du Manège. However, some fifty-six monarchien deputies did not come with them, believing the mob threat in the capital to be personally dangerous. The October journées thus effectively deprived the monarchist faction of significant representation in the Assembly as most of these deputies retreated from the political scene; many, like Mounier, fled the country altogether.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of type 474, the colour scheme of beige and marine blue {{was replaced by a}} colour called [...] "Traffic Red" [...] (RAL 3020). External advertising covering the <b>entire</b> <b>bodies</b> of trains was abandoned at this time.|$|R
5|$|They {{can strike}} to a {{distance}} of about one third of their body length, but juveniles will launch their <b>entire</b> <b>bodies</b> forwards in the process. These snakes rarely grip their victims, instead releasing quickly to return to the striking position.|$|R
5|$|There {{are very}} few Arabians {{registered}} as roan, and according to researcher D. Phillip Sponenberg, roaning in purebred Arabians is actually the action of rabicano genetics. Unlike a genetic roan, rabicano is a partial roan-like pattern; the horse does not have intermingled white and solid hairs over the <b>entire</b> <b>body,</b> only on the midsection and flanks, the head and legs are solid-colored. Some people also confuse a young gray horse with a roan because of the intermixed hair colors common to both. However, a roan does not consistently lighten with age, while a gray does.|$|E
5|$|To prevent injuries, boulderers {{position}} crash pads {{near the}} boulder {{to provide a}} softer landing, {{as well as one}} or more spotters to help redirect the climber towards the pads. Upon landing, boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in gymnastics: spreading the impact across the <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> to avoid bone fractures, and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout the impact.|$|E
5|$|Alphonse {{is one of}} {{the protagonists}} from the series {{alongside}} his older brother Edward. Alphonse loses his <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> while he and Edward are trying to revive his mother Trisha using alchemy. Edward sacrifices his right arm to seal Alphonse's soul into a suit of armor. Edward later becomes an alchemist from the state military of Amestris, and starts traveling with Alphonse to search for a method to recover Alphonse's body. They seek the Philosopher's Stone, which would allow them to restore their physical forms. Besides being a powerful alchemist, Alphonse is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter; having been trained by Izumi Curtis. While Alphonse cannot feel anything because he has no body, he is nearly invincible as long as the blood mark made by Edward on his armor to contain his soul is not defaced.|$|E
5000|$|The Spaniards {{called them}} [...] "Colorado" [...] (meaning colored red) because {{they used to}} cover their <b>entire</b> <b>bodies</b> in the red juices of the achiote seeds, for {{prevention}} against Smallpox, but the Spaniards thought red was indeed their true skin color.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} film, the Krites appear larger {{than in the}} first film, have larger teeth, with fur (thicker and more {{haphazard}} than their predecessors) covering their <b>entire</b> <b>bodies</b> except for their arms and legs. Also their poisonous darts are much bigger.|$|R
50|$|X. pubescens is {{a species}} of large {{carpenter}} bee. Females are large and shiny, with black coloration and yellow markings on their heads. Males are smaller than females, distinguished by a narrow head and yellow pubescence (erect hairs) that covers their <b>entire</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
5|$|An Italian Canadian butcher named Lupo is {{complaining}} {{about his job}} one day, while cutting meat in his shop. As each new slice falls to the ground, Lupo grows increasingly angry and swears at the meat. He then accidentally cuts off his own thumb, which inexplicably causes his <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> to fall apart. Blood gushes out onto the ground, and the various pieces of Lupo's body collapse into a pile. The screen darkens and closes in on Lupo's severed head, but before the scene can disappear entirely, Lupo's head jumps forward, still alive. It remains on the screen, shouting insults during the credits, and then falls asleep.|$|E
5|$|Black mambas breed {{annually}} and mating {{occurs in the}} early spring, when male mambas locate a female by following her scent trail. After finding a potential mate the male will inspect the female by flicking his tongue over her <b>entire</b> <b>body.</b> As in other species of snakes and many other reptiles, fertilization is internal and the intromittent organs of the males are {{in the form of}} hemipenes. Females lay clutches of eggs with an incubation period of some 80 to 90 days. Like most snakes female mambas are both oviparous and iteroparous. Egg-laying typically occurs during the middle of summer and egg clutches range from 6 to 17 eggs.|$|E
5|$|Examining the oxygen-isotope ratio {{from the}} bones from {{different}} parts of an extinct animal's body should indicate which thermoregulation mode an animal used during its lifetime. An endothermic (warm-blooded) animal should maintain a very similar body temperature throughout its <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> (which is called homeothermy) and therefore there should be little variation in the oxygen-isotope ratio when measured in different bones. Alternatively, the oxygen-isotope ratio differs considerably when measured throughout the body of an organism with an ectothermic (cold-blooded) physiology. Oxygen-isotope ratios calculated for Hypacrosaurus suggesting that the ratios varied little, indicating that Hypacrosaurus was a homeotherm, and likely was endothermic. This is in contrast to the Ruben et al. (1996) finding that Hypacrosaurus was not warm-blooded, which was based on the absence of nasal turbinates (see Crest functions subsection, above).|$|E
