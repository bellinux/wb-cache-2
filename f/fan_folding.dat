VAM never attempted {{to hide the}} relation between the two models, which never harmed the sales or image of either model and was favored by the public. The launch of the Gremlin in Mexico also meant the resurrection of the [...] I6 engine that was discontinued in 1972. The engine was practically the same as in its final year except for a slightly lower compression ratio (8.3:1 instead of 8.5:1). The advertised output was still the same at 145 gross horsepower at 4,400 revolutions per minute and was restricted to one-barrel carburetors. In contrast, since 1973 all VAM-based Hornets had the [...] six as the standard and only engine. VAM Gremlins were basic economy cars with manual 3-speed transmission, four-wheel drum brakes, manual steering, front sway bar, column-mounted shifters only, rigid four-bladed cooling <b>fan,</b> <b>folding</b> bench seats, two-point front seatbelts, electric wipers and washers, monaural AM radio, cigarette lighter, front and rear ashtrays, locking glovebox, flip-open rear side vents, roof rack, full carpeting with driver's side rubber mat, padded sunvisors, sound-insulating cardboard-type headliner, dual coat hooks and round dome light. Options for 1974 included a column-mounted automatic transmission, power steering, power drum brakes, heater, parcel shelf, light group, remote-controlled driver and passenger side outside mirrors, sports steering wheel, bright molding package, and wheel trim rings. All VAM Gremlins used the AMC's three-pod instrument cluster from the domestic-built Hornet with a blank in the third gauge position from the factory. The introductory year production was 2,137.|$|E
50|$|When a chest tube is {{inserted}} for whatever reason, maintaining patency {{is critical to}} avoid complications due to clogging or clotting that obstruct drainage and can result in retained blood syndrome. Manual manipulation, often called milking, stripping, <b>fan</b> <b>folding,</b> or tapping, of chest tubes is commonly performed to clear chest tube obstructions. No conclusive evidence has demonstrated {{that any of these}} techniques are more effective than the others, and no method has shown to improve chest tube drainage. Furthermore, chest tube manipulation has proved to increase negative pressure, which may be detrimental, and painful to the patient. For these reasons, many hospitals do not allow these types of manual tube manipulations.|$|E

5000|$|In ancient Japan, hand fans, such as oval {{and silk}} fans were {{influenced}} greatly by the Chinese fans. The earliest visual depiction of fans in Japan {{dates back to}} the 6th century CE, with burial tomb paintings showed drawings of <b>fans.</b> The <b>folding</b> <b>fan</b> was invented in Japan, with date ranging from the 6th to 9th centuries. It was a court fan called the Akomeogi (Akomeōgi) after the court women's dress named Akome. According to the Song Sui (History of Song), a Japanese monk Chonen (938－1016) offered the <b>folding</b> <b>fans</b> (twenty wooden-bladed fans hiogi (hiōgi) and two paper fans kawahori-ogi ( [...] kawahori-ōgi) to the emperor of China in 988.

Custom paper sizes, with pre-printed lines/text/colours etc. were common, especially for applications like payroll, and small paper-tape control loops were needed to match page-throw size to each paper type.|$|R

50|$|The planet's {{ecosystem}} {{suffers from}} a number of particular peculiarities, most notably evolutionary quirks to allow all living organisms to detect and avoid solar flares. Red dwarf stars are unstable and eject frequent solar flares. Such intense ultraviolet radiation is deadly to all carbon-based life forms as it breaks down the atomic bonds formed by organic compounds. The Gulphogs have adapted by having an ultraviolet light sensitive eye on top of their heads. Stinger <b>Fans</b> <b>fold</b> up to protect themselves. Mudpods have sensitive backs that can sense the ultraviolet rays. The Hysteria's adaption is unknown. However, the flare stage might only be when the red dwarfs are relatively young.|$|R

50|$|In the 17th {{century the}} <b>folding</b> <b>fan,</b> and its {{attendant}} semiotic culture, were introduced from Japan. Simpler fans were developed in China, Greece, and Egypt. Japanese fans (and Chinese imports) became popular in Europe. These fans are particularly well displayed in the portraits of the high-born women of the era. Queen Elizabeth I of England {{can be seen to}} carry both <b>folding</b> <b>fans</b> decorated with pom poms on their guardsticks as well as the older style rigid fan, usually decorated with feathers and jewels. These rigid style fans often hung from the skirts of ladies, but of the fans of this era it is only the more exotic folding ones which have survived. Those <b>folding</b> <b>fans</b> of the 15th century found in museums today have either leather leaves with cut out designs forming a lace-like design or a more rigid leaf with inlays of more exotic materials like mica. One of the characteristics of these fans is the rather crude bone or ivory sticks and the way the leather leaves are often slotted onto the sticks rather than glued as with later <b>folding</b> <b>fans.</b> Fans made entirely of decorated sticks without a fan 'leaf' were known as brisé fans. However, despite the relative crude methods of construction <b>folding</b> <b>fans</b> were at this era high status, exotic items on par with elaborate gloves as gifts to royalty.|$|R
