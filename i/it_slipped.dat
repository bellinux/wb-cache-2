This became the highest selling album by a female artist for first week sales of 2010. Rock 'n' Roll Circus became Hamasaki's tenth studio album to debut atop the Oricon Albums Chart for both Daily and Weekly rankings, making Hamasaki the first artist to have at least one album {{at the top of the}} charts for 12 consecutive years. Hamasaki also became the only female artist to have the most number one albums on Oricon since her debut with eleven entries, apart from Guilty which reached number two. <b>It</b> <b>slipped</b> to number three the following week, shifting 45,686 in Japan.

It debuted at number five on the Oricon Albums Chart and sold 39,295 units, making it Hamasaki's lowest first week sales in her career at the time and was her first album to miss the top three position. Its low first week sales were attributed to the lack of promotion of the album and stiff competition by other artists at the time, as described by Japanese publications. It dropped to number 16 the following week, her first album not to stay inside the top ten for at least two weeks, with sales of 6,122 units. The following week, <b>it</b> <b>slipped</b> to number 31 with 2,922 units sold, and fell outside the top 50 the following week. It sold 53,406 units by the end of 2014, and was ranked number 98 on Oricon's Annual Chart. Despite its much lower success, it became her 47th record to chart within the top ten on the Oricon Albums Chart; Hamasaki became the second artist in Japanese music history to achieve this after Yumi Matsutoya. Elsewhere, the album reached number 75 and 16 on the South Korean Gaon Albums Chart and Gaon International Chart.|$|E
