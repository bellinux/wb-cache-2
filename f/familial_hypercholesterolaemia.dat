50|$|In February 2003, Nabil Seidah, a {{scientist}} at the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal in Canada, discovered a novel human proprotein convertase, the gene for which was located on the short arm of chromosome 1. Meanwhile, a lab led by Catherine Boileau at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris had been following families with <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia,</b> a genetic condition that, in 90% of cases causes coronary artery disease (FRAMINGHAM study) and in 60% of cases may lead to an early death; they had identified a mutation on chromosome 1 carried by some of these families, but {{had been unable to}} identify the relevant gene. The labs got together {{and by the end of}} the year published their work, linking mutations in the gene, now identified as PCSK9, to the condition. In their paper, they speculated that the mutations might make the gene overactive. In that same year, investigators at Rockefeller University and University of Texas Southwestern had discovered the same protein in mice, and had worked out the novel pathway that regulates LDL cholesterol in which PCSK9 is involved, and it soon became clear that the mutations identified in France led to excessive PCSK9 activity, and thus excessive removal of the LDL receptor, leaving people carrying the mutations with too much LDL cholesterol. Meanwhile, Dr. Helen H. Hobbs and Dr. Jonathan Cohen at UT-Southwestern had been studying people with very high and very low cholesterol, and had been collecting DNA samples. With the new knowledge about the role of PCSK9 and its location in the genome, they sequenced the relevant region of chromosome 1 in people with very low cholesterol and they found nonsense mutations in the gene, thus validating PCSK9 as a biological target for drug discovery. In July 2015, the FDA approved the new treatment.|$|E

40|$|Background <b>Familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> {{increases}} the risk for cardiovascular disease. The primary aim {{of the present study}} was to describe sex differences in incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease leading to hospitalisation in a complete cohort of genotyped <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> patients. Design and methods In this registry study data on 5538 patients with verified genotyped <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> were linked to data on all Norwegian cardiovascular disease hospitalisations, and hospitalisations due to pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, congenital heart defects and diabetes. Results During 1994 – 2009 a total of 1411 of <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> patients were hospitalised, and ischaemic heart disease was reported in 90 % of them. Mean (SD) age at first hospitalisation and first re-hospitalisation was 45. 1 (16. 5) and 47. 6 (16. 3) years, respectively, with no sex differences (P[*]=[*] 0. 66 and P[*]=[*] 0. 93, respectively). More men (26. 9 %) than women (24. 1 %) with <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> were hospitalised (P[*]=[*] 0. 02). The median (25 th– 75 th percentile) number of hospital admissions was four (two to seven) per <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> patient, with no sex differences (P[*]=[*] 0. 87). Despite having <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> at the time of hospitalisation, the diagnosis of <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> was registered in only 45. 7 % of the patients at discharge. Conclusion Most cardiovascular disease hospitalisations were due to ischaemic heart disease. <b>Familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> patients were first time hospitalised at age 45. 1 years, with no significant sex differences in age, which are important novel findings.

40|$|<b>Familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> is an {{autosomal}} dominant inherited disorder characterised by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and consequently {{an increased risk}} of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). <b>Familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> is relatively common, but is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Cardiologists are likely to encounter many individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia; however, patients presenting with premature ASCVD are rarely screened for <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> and fasting lipid levels are infrequently documented. Given that individuals with <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> and ASCVD are at a particularly high risk of subsequent cardiac events, this is a missed opportunity for preventive therapy. Furthermore, because there is a 50 % chance that first-degree relatives of individuals with <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> will also be affected by the disorder, the underdiagnosis of <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> among patients with ASCVD is a barrier to cascade screening and the prevention of ASCVD in affected relatives. Targeted screening of patients with ASCVD is an effective strategy to identify new <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> index cases. Statins are the standard treatment for individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia; however, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not achieved in a large proportion of patients despite treatment. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK 9) inhibitors have been shown to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels considerably in individuals with <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> who are concurrently receiving the maximal tolerated statin dose. The clinical benefit of PCSK 9 inhibitors must, however, also be considered in terms of their cost-effectiveness.

40|$|An {{angiographic}} comparison {{was made}} of the extent and severity of coronary artery disease in 25 patients with heterozygous <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> and 25 normocholesterolaemic patients with coronary artery disease in whom heavy cigarette consumption was the chief risk factor. The patients with <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> were younger and included a much higher proportion of women than the smokers.

The following manifestations were significantly increased in the patients: (a) tendon xanthomas particularly of the tendo Achillis in {{patients with}} adult <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> and mixed hyperlipidaemia; (b) tendo Achillis tendinitis in patients with adult <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> and mixed hyperlipidaemia; and (c) oligoarthritis in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia but not in those with adult <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia.</b> Migratory polyarthritis and transient tendo Achillis pain were rare. Thirty eight per cent of patients with juvenile <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> had musculoskeletal system manifestations none of which was significantly increased compared with controls.

40|$|Abstract. Extracorporeal {{removal of}} LDL {{cholesterol}} (LDL apheresis) {{has been carried}} out in patients with diet- and drug-resistant hypercholesterolaemia to pre-vent or to reduce coronary heart disease. Plasma separation {{is the first step in}} all five LDL-apheresis methods presently available. Plain plasma exchange and double-membrane filtration are unselective and remove HDL cholesterol and plasma proteins. Adsorption of LDL to dextran sulphate, to LDL antibodies, or precipitation of LDL by heparin at low pH are more selective. With all methods LDL choles-terol reduction per treatment is 60 - 70 %. In most patients one treatment per week is sufficient to reduce mean LDL to 100 - 150 mg/dl. Minor side-effects occur in 10 ± 5 % of treatments. Major side-effects are rare. Long-term LDL apheresis increased survival in patients with homozygous <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia.</b> In heterozygous <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> controlled studies regarding survival are not available. Uncontrolled trials indicate regression of coronary artery disease in heterozygotes with drug- and diet-resistant LDL cholesterol> 200 mg/dl. Hence, LDL apheresis is indicated in all patients with homozygous <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia.</b> LDL apheresis in het-erozygous <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> should be restricted to patients with diet- and drug-resistant LDL cholesterol> 200 mg/dl with coronary heart disease and/or other atherosclerotic vascular lesion.

Subjects: All members of pedigree aged over 20 years with 0. 5 probability of carrying a mutation for <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia.</b> All cause mortality. A total of 70 deaths took place among 250 people analysed for 6950 person years. Mortality was not increased in carriers of the mutation during the 19 th and early 20 th century; it rose after 1915, reached its maximum between 1935 and 1964 (standardised mortality ratio 1. 78, 95 % confidence interval 1. 13 to 2. 76; P= 0. 003), and fell thereafter.

40|$|<b>Familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> is {{a common}} lipid {{disorder}} that predisposes for premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). We set up a screening programme in the Netherlands in 1994 to: establish the feasibility of active family screening supported by DNA diagnostics; assess whether or not active identification of these patients with <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> would lead to more cholesterol-lowering treatment; and compare diagnosis by DNA analysis with that by cholesterol measurement. Both DNA analysis and measurement of cholesterol concentrations were used to screen families in which a functional mutation in the LDL-receptor gene had been detected. In the first 5 years, 5442 relatives of 237 people with <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> were screened; 2039 individuals were identified as heterozygous by LDL-receptor gene mutation analysis. At the time of examination, 667 of these adults with <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> (39 %) received some form of lipid-lowering treatment; 1 year later, this percentage had increased to 93 %. In addition, laboratory analysis showed that for carriers as well as non-carriers 18 % would have been misdiagnosed by cholesterol measurement alone, with sex-specific and age-specific 90 th percentiles of the general Dutch population as diagnostic criteria. Targeted family screening with DNA analysis proved to be highly effective in identifying patients with hypercholesterolaemia.

40|$|<b>Familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> (FH) is a co-dominantly {{inherited}} {{disorder that}} causes marked elevation in plasma cholesterol and premature coronary heart disease.

40|$|Background <b>Familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> is {{a common}} autosomal-dominant {{disorder}} caused by mutations in three known genes. DNA-based cascade testing is recommended by UK guidelines to identify affected relatives; however, about 60 % of patients are mutation-negative. We assessed the hypothesis that <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> can also be caused by an accumulation of common small-effect LDL-C-raising alleles. Methods In November, 2011, we assembled a sample of patients with <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> from three UKbased sources and compared them with a healthy control sample from the UK Whitehall II (WHII) study. We also studied patients from a Belgian lipid clinic (Hopital de Jolimont, Haine St-Paul, Belgium) for validation analyses. We genotyped participants for 12 common LDL-C-raising alleles identified by the Global Lipid Genetics Consortium and constructed a weighted LDL-C-raising gene score. We compared the gene score distribution among patients with <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> with no confirmed mutation, those with an identified mutation, and controls from WHII. Findings We recruited 321 mutation-negative UK patients (451 Belgian), 319 mutation-positive UK patients (273 Belgian), and 3020 controls from WHII. The mean weighted LDL-C gene score of the WHII participants (0. 90 [SD 0. 23]) was strongly associated with LDL-C concentration (p= 1. 4 × 10 - 77; R 2 = 0. 11). Mutation-negative UK patients had a significantly higher mean weighted LDL-C score (1. 0 [SD 0. 21]) than did WHII controls (p= 4. 5 × 10 - 16), as did the mutation-negative Belgian patients (0. 99 [0. 19]; p= 5. 2 × 10 - 20). The score was also higher in UK (0. 95 [0. 20]; p= 1. 6 × 10 - 5) and Belgian (0. 92 [0. 20]; p= 0. 04) mutation-positive patients than in WHII controls. 167 (52 %) of 321 mutation-negative UK patients had a score within the top three deciles of the WHII weighted LDL-C gene score distribution, and only 35 (11 %) fell within the lowest three deciles. Interpretation In a substantial proportion of patients with <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolaemia</b> without a known mutation, their raised LDL-C concentrations might have a polygenic cause, which could compromise the efficiency of cascade testing. In patients with a detected mutation, a substantial polygenic contribution might add to the variable penetrance of the disease...|$|E
