500|$|As president, Coolidge's {{reputation}} as a quiet man continued. [...] "The words of a President have an enormous weight," [...] he would later write, [...] "and {{ought not to be}} used indiscriminately." [...] Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. [...] "I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President," [...] he once told Ethel Barrymore, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> go along with them." [...] Some historians would later suggest that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic, while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening {{after the death of his}} son in 1924.|$|E
500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{reply to}} a {{question}} in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Carl Sagan answered, [...] "I'm agnostic." [...] Sagan maintained {{that the idea of}} a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe. Sagan's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to Einstein's belief in Spinoza's God. His son, Dorion Sagan said, [...] "My father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature but as nature, equivalent to it." [...] His last wife, Ann Druyan, stated: When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.|$|E

He lived there with Marianne Ihlen, with whom {{he was in a}} relationship for most of the 1960s. The song [...] "So Long, Marianne" [...] was written to and about her. Ihlen died of leukemia three months before Cohen.

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of Sunday, 26 November, two days after he had {{convinced}} the nurses {{to remain on the}} job, Margaret was startled to hear her husband's voice sound heavily congested. [...] He told her that he had a [...] "terrible flu". [...] The next morning, he and Sister Maria agreed that he had malaria. [...] "We said malaria, but we thought Ebola," [...] she later said. [...] His fever grew worse through the day, a Monday, and by Wednesday was vomiting and Dr. Pierre Rollin of the CDC took blood samples for testing. [...] A nurse who was administering an intravenous drip that evening at his home was surprised when he began speaking distinctly, though not to her: [...] "Oh, God, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> die in my service. [...] If I die, let me be the last." [...] Then, in a clear voice, he sang [...] "Onward, Christian Soldiers". Rollin came back with the results the next morning; it was Ebola. [...] Lukwiya immediately asked to be put into the isolation ward, stating [...] "Since I am the boss, I should show an example." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 9, 2006, Montoya {{announced}} {{his plans to}} compete in the NASCAR Nextel Cup series beginning with the 2007 season, racing for Chip Ganassi and Felix Sabates's NASCAR operation, Chip Ganassi Racing, in the No. 42 Texaco/Havoline-sponsored car. [...] "I'm looking forward to racing in the Nextel Cup Series for Chip Ganassi in the Big Red Car. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> learn a lot from my teammates and other drivers around me. It will be tough though {{to get used to the}} difference in the cars." [...] Montoya made his stock car debut in an Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) event at the Talladega Superspeedway on October 6, 2006. He qualified second, led the first nine laps, and finished third when the race was called after 79 of 92 laps. Three weeks later he followed this with an 11th-place finish after a mid-race spin at the Sam's Town 250 at Memphis Motorsports Park, his first appearance in NASCAR's second division Busch Series. He competed in the final three races of the Busch Series season, but did not better this performance. He would later run 17 Busch Series races on a part-time schedule the following year. On November 19, 2006, Montoya competed for the first time in NASCAR's premier division, the NEXTEL Cup Series. He qualified 29th in the No. 30 Texaco car at the Ford 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. He was running just outside the top 10 when contact with Ryan Newman ended his race on lap 251. His car ended up in the grass engulfed in flames due to his fuel cell erupting during the crash and he was credited with a 34th-place finish. Finished 71st in series points.|$|E
2500|$|On March 3, 1865, the {{day before}} Lincoln's second inauguration, Grant wired to Washington that Lee had sent representatives to him to sue for peace. Lincoln {{initially}} told Grant that he should get peace with the South by any means necessary. Stanton declared, however, {{that it is the}} president's duty to sue for peace; otherwise, the president is useless and little more than a figure-head. This engendered an immediate change of tone from the president. Stanton, at Lincoln's urging, told Grant that he was to [...] "have no conference with General Lee unless it be for the capitulation of Gen. Lee's army, or on some minor, and purely, military matter". Further, Grant was not to [...] "decide, discuss, or confer upon any political questions. Such matters the President holds in his own hands; and will submit them to no military conferences or conventions". Grant agreed. Days later, Lincoln visited Grant at his siege headquarters (the Siege of Petersburg was still ongoing). Once Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan had rejoined his army from the Shenandoah Valley, Grant was prepared to make his final push into Richmond. On April 1, 1865, Sheridan defeated Lee's army in the Battle of Five Forks, forcing a retreat from Petersburg. Stanton, who had stayed close to his telegraph for days, told his wife the following evening: [...] "Petersburg is evacuated and probably Richmond. Put out your flags." [...] Stanton was worried that President Lincoln, who had stayed around to watch Grant's push into Richmond, was in danger of being captured, and warned him. Lincoln disagreed, but was happy for Stanton's concern. The President wrote Stanton: [...] "It is certain now that Richmond is in our hands, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> go there to-morrow." ...|$|E
