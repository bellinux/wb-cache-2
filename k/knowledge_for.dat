5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a rise in cases of {{undisclosed}} synthetic diamond melee being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade. Due to the relatively inexpensive cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal <b>knowledge</b> <b>for</b> identifying large quantities of melee efficiently, not all dealers have made an effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also from}} the Neolithic, in about 3000 BC, that we glimpse the first known {{illustrations}} of plants and read descriptions of impressive gardens in Egypt. However protobotany, the first pre-scientific written record of plants, did not begin with food; it {{was born out of}} the medicinal literature of Egypt, China, Mesopotamia and India. Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that agriculture was the occupation of the poor and uneducated, while medicine was the realm of socially influential shamans, priests, apothecaries, magicians and physicians, who were more likely to record their <b>knowledge</b> <b>for</b> posterity.|$|E

5|$|This {{dedication}} to reading and study might, in another boy, have been {{nothing more than}} a reaction to the impending examinations — but not in Jan's case.

5|$|Although {{some historians}} have {{identified}} Garrard {{as a member}} of the Danville Political Club, a secret debating society that was active in Danville, Kentucky, from 1786 to 1790, his name is not found in the Club's official membership records. Garrard's biographer, H. E. Everman, concludes that these historians may have mistaken Garrard's membership in the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful <b>Knowledge</b> <b>for</b> membership in the Danville Political Club. The groups had similar aims, were active at about the same time, and had several members in common. Other notable members of the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge included Isaac Shelby, Christopher Greenup, and Thomas Todd, all future Kentucky governors or gubernatorial candidates.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, McMaster's School of Medicine adopted {{progress}} testing, {{developing the}} personal progress index (PPI), a {{system based on}} progress testing invented concurrently by the University of Missouri-Kansas City's medical school and the Maastricht University. The PPI is used as an objective method for assessing acquisition and retention of <b>knowledge</b> <b>for</b> students in the medical program. The PPI is administered at regular intervals to {{all students in the}} program, regardless of their level of training, and plots students' scores as they move through the program. Students typically score 20 percent on their first examination, and increase by five to seven percent with each successive examination. Students can monitor the changes in their scores and receive formative feedback based on a standardized score relative to the class mean. Due to the overwhelming success and research supporting the use of the PPI as an evaluation tool, it is now used in Canada, US, Europe, and Australia.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the global}} race <b>for</b> {{competitive}} advantage <b>Knowledge</b> Management gains increasing importance for companies. The purposeful and systematic creation, maintenance, and transfer of unstructured <b>knowledge</b> sources demands <b>for</b> advanced Information Technology. Ontologies constitute a basic ingredient of Knowledge Management; thus, ontology learning from unstructured knowledge sources {{is of particular}} interest since it bears the potential to bring significant advantages <b>for</b> <b>Knowledge</b> Management. This paper presents a study of state-of-the-art research of ontology learning from unstructured <b>knowledge</b> sources <b>for</b> <b>Knowledge</b> Management. Nine approaches for ontology learning from unstructured knowledge sources are identified from a systematic review of literature. A six point classification framework is developed.

According to Giaimo, there were three important factors that they had acquired from the Norway research trip: the fjords, which are the massive vertical rock formations, and serve as the setting for the secluded kingdom of Arendelle; the medieval stave churches, whose rustic triangular rooflines and shingles inspired the castle compound; and the rosemaling folk art, whose distinctive paneling and grid patterns informed the architecture, decor, and costumes.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} single-car trains were {{delivered}} in 1959 {{and given the}} designation T. They were delivered by Strømmens Værksted and NEBB as prototypes, without compensation from the planning office. They were tested on the Østensjø and Lambertseter Lines until 1 December 1960, when they were transferred to Bærumsbanen, who used them on the Kolsås Line. During their service they were prone to technical problems, and were more in the depot than in service. However, they gave valuable <b>knowledge</b> <b>for</b> the serial production. The trains were originally painted silver with a dark-blue cheatline and numbered 1 and 2. About 1970, they were repainted dark blue with a silver cheatline, and in 1971 given the numbers 451 and 452. The latter remained in service until 1977, when it was put aside, and scrapped in 1987. The former remained in service until it was put aside as defect, although it had rarely been used since 1982. It was fixed up and made operational again 1993, but was withdrawn the same year and scrapped the following year.|$|E
