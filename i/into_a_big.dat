25|$|Around this time, {{faces and}} heels became a {{generally}} more obvious and {{important part of}} wrestling. 'Gimmicks' were more popular, and it widely became a popular sport again. Wrestling was generally seen more {{as a form of}} fun and entertainment, however, than an official sport. It was more about building up face/heel feuds such as Roddy Piper/Hulk Hogan and going <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> blow off match, which people loved. The WWF broke its way into mainstream entertainment and regularly brought in celebrities such as Muhammad Ali.|$|E
25|$|In the House of Commons {{in early}} April Lloyd George would later claim, amidst press demands for Robertson’s {{restoration}} to office, that Wilson had predicted exactly {{when and where}} the German offensive would come. In fact on 21 March the day the German Michael Offensive began, Wilson advised that the attack “might only develop <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> raid or demonstration” and focussed the War Cabinet on the German threat to Asia. Although {{it was not yet}} clear in London, on that one day the Germans captured as much territory as the British had captured in 140 days at the Somme in 1916.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{development}} of modern refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick ice houses, insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including U.S. Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, cut and stored ice in the winter {{for use in the}} summer. Frederic Tudor of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.|$|E

25|$|In 1761, Durrani {{set out on}} his {{campaign}} to win back lost territories. The early skirmishes ended in victory for the Afghans against the Maratha garrisons in northwest India. By 1759, Durrani and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> enough army {{under the command of}} Sadashivrao Bhau. Once again, Panipat was the scene of a battle for control of northern India. The Third battle of Panipat was fought between Durrani's Afghan forces and the Maratha forces in January 1761, and resulted in a decisive Durrani victory. This brought Punjab till north of Sutlej river under Afghan control. Ahmad Shah Durrani vacated Delhi soon after the battle.|$|E
25|$|Lanying Lin {{was born}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> and prestigious family, {{which could be}} traced back to the Ming dynasty 600 years ago. Run Ling, the {{ancestor}} of Lanying Lin, was an imperial censor during the Ming Dynasty. Imperial censor is an official position that controls and supervises other government officials. During his work time, he faced two powerful people who broke many laws. He helped the emperor conquer the two contenders to power, so the emperor gave him money to build a magnificent house in Putian, which is now called the Old House of Run Ling. The ancestors of Lanying Lin and Lanying Lin herself were all born and raised in this house. Because of Run Ling, the family of Lanying Lin can be considered to be nobles.|$|E

Though Eleanor survives, Delta begins to slowly die as the bond cannot be re-established. Using a Little Sister, Eleanor transforms herself <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> Sister and breaks Delta from confinement. Together they head for an escape pod that Sinclair has arranged to leave Rapture. The two find that Lamb has converted Sinclair into Subject Omega, declaring that Delta should be what Sinclair is now, and Delta is forced to finish him off. After a final climactic showdown with the remnants of The Rapture Family in order to buy time for Eleanor to prepare the pod, Delta is forced to flood the area and escape in his suit. Eleanor and Delta {{make it to the}} escape pod but a bomb set by Lamb leaves Delta mortally wounded. Eleanor teleports and reaches the escape pod before the bomb blows, while Delta manages to grab onto the pod's side and climb aboard as it rises.|$|E

25|$|Ahmad Shah {{declared}} a jihad (or Islamic holy war) against the Marathas, and warriors from various Afghan tribes joined his army, including the Baloch {{people under the}} command of Khan of Kalat Mir Nasir I of Kalat. Early skirmishes were followed by victory for the Afghans against the smaller Maratha garrisons in Northwest India and by 1759 Ahmad Shah and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> enough army {{under the command of}} Sadashivrao Bhau. Once again, Panipat was the scene of a confrontation between two warring contenders for control of northern India. The Third Battle of Panipat (14 January 1761), fought between largely Muslim and largely Hindu armies was waged along a twelve-kilometer front. Despite decisively defeating the Marathas, what might have been Ahmad Shah's peaceful control of his domains was disrupted by many challenges. As far as losses are concerned, Afghans too suffered heavily in the Third Battle of Panipat. This weakened his grasp over Punjab which fell to the rising Sikh misls. There were rebellions in the north in the region of Bukhara.|$|E
25|$|With Australia chasing 412 to win, {{they lost}} Rogers for 10 early on, ending his record-equalling run of half-centuries, but a 78-run {{partnership}} between Warner and Smith looked to have stabilised the innings. The stand {{was broken by}} Moeen Ali in the final over before lunch, trapping Warner LBW for 52. Australia then lost Smith (33), Clarke (4) and Voges (1) in the five overs following the interval; {{in the space of}} six overs, they had fallen from 97/1 to 106/5. Haddin was next to go, caught at short midwicket by Cook for 7; the England captain parried the ball up at the first attempt, but retained his focus to cling on at the second time of asking. Watson (19) did his best to reignite the innings before being trapped LBW {{for the second time in}} the match, reducing Australia to 151/7. Johnson and Starc then shared a 72-run partnership for the eighth wicket, only for Root's off spin to find both their edges to leave the tourists 169 behind with one wicket in hand. Root was again involved in the final wicket, as Moeen Ali tempted Hazlewood <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> shot down the ground to long on, where Root was waiting to take the catch and seal victory. For his contributions primarily with the bat, but also with the ball, Root was named Man of the Match.|$|E

[...] Harrison says: [...] "The appearance of episode 1 was unusual enough but could be explained as an extended break between verse and refrain sections. Episode 2 however, makes that interpretation untenable, and both listener and analyst must entertain the idea that 'Good Vibrations' develops under its own power, as it were, without the guidance of overdetermined formal patterns. Brian’s own description of the song—a three-and-a-half-minute 'pocket symphony'—is a telling clue about his formal ambitions here." ...|$|E

Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once.

500|$|When {{designing}} Ares, Charlie Wen {{was advised}} {{that the character}} should be 90% elemental and 5–10% human, then began sketching. He said {{that the rest of}} the team liked the designs, but were uncertain about execution. The transition towards Ares' human form was slow, and Wen said of the final design, [...] "he's still a huge guy, but he's got all this armor on that allows him to do all these things." [...] Like most of the Olympian gods in God of War, Zeus first appeared as a floating translucent head, and was modeled on the typical representation of the god in Greek mythology. Cory Barlog (Game Director of God of War II) said that for God of War II, they wanted to maintain Zeus' appearance from literature, but also to add their own interpretation to the character. Zeus' human appearance was originally designed by Charlie Wen for God of War II. This design was also used in God of War III, with updated graphics and the addition of an arm piece during the final fight. Andy Park was responsible for designing Zeus' spirit form for the final fight. Park produced several sketches, and imagined Zeus as a [...] "massive tornado creature with lightning searing throughout the form."

500|$|Due to Manson's growing {{confidence}} and technical skill, the band decided that her vocals {{did not require}} much treatment; [...] "Shirley was singing so much better, and she was coming up with melodies that were longer and had more range to them...there wasn't any point in doing a lot with it.

Manson's original guide vocals were used in the final mixes of several songs; the vocal on [...] "So Like a Rose" [...] was recorded on the first take. On some songs, however, Manson's vocal was subject to Pro Tools plug-ins and post effects. [...] "Til the Day Die" [...] featured a digital [...] "scratch"-effect, created by printing her vocal to DAT and using whatever edited passes sounded good. On [...] "Can't Cry These Tears", the four vocal parts were triple-tracked using different mikes, while a guitar riff was matched to her voice for a section of [...] "Breaking Up the Girl". On [...] "Cherry Lips", her entire vocal was sped up and heavily EQ'd. On slower songs such as [...] "Drive You Home", Garbage were not overly concerned with phrasing and pitch, giving it [...] "a rawer quality". Manson improved on her guitar skills and played more guitar in the studio and live on stage for the eventual tour.|$|E
