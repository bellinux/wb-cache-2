25|$|The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty {{was signed}} October 4, 1991, and entered into force January 14, 1998; this {{agreement}} prevents development and {{provides for the}} protection of the Antarctic environment through five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna and flora, <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessments,</b> waste management, and protected areas. It prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources except scientific. A sixth annex on liability arising from environmental emergencies was adopted in 2005, but is yet to enter into force.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known treatises {{dealing with}} environmentalism and environmental science, especially pollution, were Arabic medical treatises written by al-Kindi, Qusta ibn Luqa, al-Razi, Ibn Al-Jazzar, al-Tamimi, al-Masihi, Avicenna, Ali ibn Ridwan, Ibn Jumay‘, Isaac Israeli ben Solomon, Ibn al-Quff, and Ibn al-Nafis. Their works covered {{a number of}} subjects related to pollution such as air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, municipal solid waste mishandling, and <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessments</b> of certain localities. Cordoba, al-Andalus also had the first waste containers and waste disposal facilities for litter collection.|$|E
25|$|CBA {{application}} for transport investment {{started in the}} UK with the M1 motorway project, and was later applied on many projects including London Underground's Victoria line. Later, the New Approach to Appraisal (NATA) was introduced by the then Department for Transport, Environment and the Regions. This presented cost–benefit results and detailed <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessments</b> in a balanced way. NATA was first applied to national road schemes in the 1998 Roads Review but subsequently rolled out to all transport modes. As of 2011 it was a cornerstone of transport appraisal in the UK and is maintained and developed by the Department for Transport.|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this diploma thesis, called <b>Environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> (EIA) in {{european}} law, is to explain the procedure of <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessment.</b> Emphasis of this diploma thesis is placed on legislation dealing with the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> and its development. The diploma thesis is divided into five chapters, further it contains the introduction, the conclusion, the list of abbreviation, the list of pictures, attachement and the list of literature. Chapter one defines the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> itself and distinguishes the project (EIA) and strategic (SEA) assessment. Chapter two describes the international law concerning the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessment.</b> The {{most important part of}} this diploma thesis is chapter three, which contains the analysis of european and czech legislation regarding to the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessment.</b> The czech legislation is then compared to legislation of other member states of the EU.

25|$|Construction of a {{hydroelectric}} plant {{requires a}} long lead time for site studies, hydrological studies, and <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessments,</b> and are large-scale projects by comparison to traditional power generation based upon fossil fuels. The number of sites {{that can be}} economically developed for hydroelectric production is limited; new sites tend to be far from population centers and usually require extensive power transmission lines. Hydroelectric generation can be vulnerable to {{major changes in the}} climate, including variations in rainfall, ground and surface water levels, and glacial melt, causing additional expenditure for the extra capacity to ensure sufficient power is available in low-water years.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{official}} {{announcement of the}} plan, preliminary engineering work and <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessments</b> were done {{for the construction of}} the light rail lines. Public meetings have been held to generate community discussion. The plan was initially reported to be funded by both municipal and provincial levels of government. However, as the Government of Ontario later decided to postpone a portion of its capital funding to Transit City, which met with much public and political controversy, construction plans were changed causing longer delays in construction start dates. Construction of one of the lines began in December 2009.|$|E
25|$|The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) was {{prepared}} to fund the entire cost of the network {{over a longer period}} of time. The highest priority was assigned to the Sheppard East, Eglinton Crosstown LRT and Etobicoke-Finch West LRT lines, and to the revitalization of the Scarborough RT line, which was projected to be built by 2020. In addition to the mentioned lines, it was likely that some sort of link would be established between the two lines, so that they could share a single storage facility. The TTC completed the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessments</b> for most of these lines, the first one being completed for the Sheppard East line. The construction of this line commenced on December 2009 but was stopped a year later by newly elected mayor Rob Ford.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{challenges}} {{of how to}} respond to climate change and ensure sustainable development are currently high on the political agenda among the world’s leading nations. The Predictive Techniques in <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>assessment</b> {{is a part of the}} global carbon market, developing rapidly as a result of the Kyoto response towards mitigation of global warming. One of the aims of Predictive Techniques in <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>assessment</b> is to achieve sustainable development in developing countries, but uncertainty prevails as to whether the Predictive Techniques in <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>assessment</b> is doing what it promises to do. Close to 200 studies on the Predictive Techniques in <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>assessment</b> have been carried out since its birth in 1997 including peer-reviewed articles and reports from the grey literature. However, no overview of the different debates and key issues in the Predictive Techniques in <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>assessment</b> exists.

25|$|The {{authors of}} the 2007 Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture cited poor {{governance}} as one reason for some forms of water scarcity. Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work {{in the developed world}} to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the International Water Management Institute of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessments</b> were rarely undertaken. They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.|$|E
25|$|The IOC has 4 major {{approaches}} to addressing environmental health concerns during {{the construction and}} competitions of the Olympic Games. First, the IOC Sustainability and Legacy Commission focuses on how the IOC can improve the strategies and policies associated with environmental health throughout the process of cities hosting the Olympic Games. Secondly, every candidate city must provide information to the IOC on environmental health issues like air quality and <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessments.</b> Thirdly, every host city is given the option to declare “pledges” to address specific or general environmental health concerns of hosting the Olympic Game. Fourthly, the IOC has every host city collaborate with the United Nations to work towards addressing environmental health objectives. Ultimately, the IOC uses these four major approaches {{in an attempt to}} minimize the negative environmental health concerns of a host city.|$|E
25|$|The Dirección General de Asuntos Ambientales (DGAA) of the Ministerio de Energía y Minas (MEM) is {{responsible}} for addressing environmental problems that result from energy and mining activities and is mandated to implement the laws and regulations of the environmental legal framework, such as Legislative Decree No. 613 of September 1990 (the environmental code) and Supreme Decree No. 016-93-EM of April 28, 1993 (the environmental regulation). The sustainable development model for the mining and energy sectors began in 1993 with regulations and procedures for the gradual reduction of pollution, which include economic development policies and environmental protection. The mining industry must comply by adjusting its ongoing operations to permissible effluent levels and its new operations by using cleaner technologies. The DGAA evaluates and proposes the environmental regulations for the mining and energy sectors, which include the maximum emission levels that are compatible with the internationally accepted limits set by the United Nations and the World Bank, approves <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessments</b> for new operations and environmental adjustment and management programs for ongoing ones, and administers the national environmental information system. The MEM is authorized to manage environmental affairs in the minerals sector, such as establishing the environmental protection policy and maximum allowable levels for effluents, signing environmental administrative stability agreements, overseeing the impact of operations determining responsibilities, and imposing administrative sanctions. The oil companies, in particular, are under pressure {{because the number of}} operations in the Amazon Rainforest, one of the world’s most sensitive ecosystems, is increasing.|$|E
