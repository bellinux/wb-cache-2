40|$|Objectives The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} was to investigate what kind of issues female startup <b>founders</b> face in Finland, and whether the fact that Finland is perceived to be very equal society affect the issues. Summary Altogether eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted. Four interviews were conducted with female startup <b>founders,</b> three with male <b>founders</b> and four with representatives of different venture capital firms. Multiple patterns could be identified from the interviews. The main patterns include: female <b>founders</b> do not feel they experience discrimination, female <b>founders</b> often receive positive discrimination in the form of press or event coverage, female <b>founders</b> are considered more focused and determined than male <b>founders</b> on average and underlying issues very likely affect female <b>founders</b> in the technological startup industry. Conclusions The hypothesis proved to be quite correct, but still multiple surprising factors surfaced. This makes the findings important and contributes to the research of the field. It would be recommended to research the subject in greater detail. Quantitate research in particular, on female startup <b>founders</b> would be needed...|$|R
