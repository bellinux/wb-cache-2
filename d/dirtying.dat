5|$|Much of {{the prison}} {{business}} was run by a debtors' committee of nine prisoners and a chair (a position held by Dickens' father). Appointed on the last Wednesday of each month, and meeting every Monday at 11am, the committee was responsible for imposing fines for rules violations, an obligation they met with enthusiasm. Debtors could be fined for theft; throwing water or filth out of windows or into someone else's room; making noise after midnight; cursing, fighting or singing obscene songs; smoking in the beer room from 8–10 am and 12–2 pm; defacing the staircase; <b>dirtying</b> the privy seats; stealing newspapers or utensils from the snuggery; urinating in the yard; drawing water before it had boiled; and criticizing the committee.|$|E
25|$|To {{properly}} cool a fire, splash {{water on}} all embers, including {{places that are}} not glowing red. Splashing the water is both more effective and efficient in extinguishing the fire.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} whether firms’ {{share prices}} correctly reflect two accounting measures: <b>dirty</b> surplus and really <b>dirty</b> surplus. <b>Dirty</b> surplus is readily observable {{from the financial}} statements, but really <b>dirty</b> surplus, which arises from recognizing equity transactions such as employee stock option exercises at other than fair market value, is not. Findings show that <b>dirty</b> surplus and really <b>dirty</b> surplus are irrelevant for forecasting abnormal comprehensive income. However, findings also indicate that investors appear to undervalue really <b>dirty</b> surplus. Hedge returns are insignificant when portfolios are formed based on <b>dirty</b> surplus, but are significantly positive based on really <b>dirty</b> surplus. Really <b>dirty</b> surplus positive hedge returns are robust {{to a variety of}} sensitivity tests. Taken together, the findings are consistent with either investors over-valuing firms that have large negative really <b>dirty</b> surplus or really <b>dirty</b> surplus being correlated with an unmodeled risk factor...|$|R

Dickson also took great pains to distinguish the Gondorians (silvers and black) and the Rohirrim (brown and green).|$|E

2500|$|Pests pose {{a serious}} threat to {{cultural}} heritage. [...] Whether they feed off of the composition materials or seek shelter within a collection, they can cause damage through actively dismantling or consuming objects, staining or <b>dirtying</b> them, weakening structures, or simply by attracting other harmful creatures. Pests that frequent collections can be grouped into four main categories: stored product and fabric feeders that feed on dry, organic materials; [...] wood destroying insects; general feeders that may damage a variety of material types; and nuisances and health hazards, which may not be as harmful to collections, but are otherwise considered undesirable or risks to human health. Commonly encountered pests from within these categories include insects, microorganisms, and rodents, but in certain locations birds, bats, lizards, and mollusks must be considered a threat as well.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss how using {{innovative}} interpretivist approaches and diverse qualitative methods advance our understanding of <b>dirty</b> work and <b>dirty</b> work research. The paper introduces the articles that form the basis of this special issue of QROM. Design/ methodology / approach: The Guest Editors’ adopt a literature review approach identifying key arguments in the <b>dirty</b> work research to date and reflecting on the challenges of doing <b>dirty</b> work research. Findings: The Guest Editors’ conclude that research into <b>dirty</b> work incorporates the embodied experiences of the researchers and that through writing differently we can better understand <b>dirty</b> work / research as an embodied and reflexive engagement. <b>Dirty</b> work and <b>dirty</b> work research is complex and dynamic in nature marked by ambivalence and ambiguity and enveloped in relations of power. Originality / value: This issue of QROM details illustrative and innovative qualitative methods of doing <b>dirty</b> work research, it offers novel insights into understudied <b>dirty</b> work sites and the challenges of doing <b>dirty</b> research using qualitative methods. It is also the first dedicated journal issue in organization and management research literature entirely focused on <b>dirty</b> work...|$|R
