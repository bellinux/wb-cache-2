Ash can block intake structures, cause severe abrasion damage to pump <b>impellers</b> and overload pump motors. Many water treatment plants have an initial coagulation/flocculation step that is automatically adjusted to turbidity (the level of suspended solids, measured in nephelometric turbidity units) in the incoming water. In most cases, changes in turbidity caused by suspended ash particles will be within the normal operating range of the plant and can be managed satisfactorily by adjusting the addition of coagulant. Ashfalls {{will be more likely}} to cause problems for plants that are not designed for high levels of turbidity and which may omit coagulation/flocculation treatment. Ash can enter filtration systems such as open sand filters both by direct fallout and via intake waters. In most cases, increased maintenance will be required to manage the effects of an ashfall, but there will not be service interruptions.|$|E

A theoretical explanation is given to explain why NPSHR will significantly vary with <b>impeller</b> diameter for some pump designs. The degree of cavitation, as indicated by NPSHR, will change at different flow rates. Also, a change in <b>impeller</b> diameter does not generally affect NPSHR, because cavitation occurs at the <b>impeller</b> inlet.

High specific speed pumps are {{more sensitive to the}} effects of variation because of relatively shorter <b>impeller</b> blade lengths. When trimming the <b>impeller</b> diameter, the <b>impeller</b> blade length is also reduced. In some cases, the effects of cavitation blockage inside the <b>impeller</b> flow path can be more pronounced, because they interface with pressure recovery.
