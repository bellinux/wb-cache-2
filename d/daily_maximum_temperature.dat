25|$|As {{a simple}} example, {{consider}} the average daily maximum temperatures for two cities, one inland {{and one on}} the coast. It is helpful to understand that the range of daily maximum temperatures for cities near the coast is smaller than for cities inland. Thus, while these two cities may each have the same average maximum temperature, the standard deviation of the <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>temperature</b> for the coastal city will be less than that of the inland city as, on any particular day, the actual maximum temperature {{is more likely to be}} farther from the average maximum temperature for the inland city than for the coastal one.|$|E
25|$|Five {{distinct}} seasons (summer, monsoons, autumn, {{winter and}} spring) {{can be observed}} in Cooch Behar, of which summer, monsoons and winter are more prominent. Cooch Behar has a moderate climate characterised by heavy rainfall during the monsoons and slight rainfall from October to mid-November. The district does not have high temperatures at any time of the year. The summer season is from April, the hottest month, to May. During the summer season, the mean <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>temperature</b> is 36.5°C, and the mean daily minimum is 20.2°C. The winter season lasts from the end of November to February; January is the coldest, when temperature ranges between 10.4°C and 24.1°C. The lowest and highest temperatures recorded have been 3.9°C and 39.9°C respectively. The atmosphere is highly humid except from February to May, when relative humidity is around 50 to 70 percent. The rainy season lasts from June to September. Average annual rainfall in the district is 3,201mm. However, the climate has undergone a drastic change in the past few years, with the mercury rising and the rainfall decreasing each year.|$|E

2500|$|Summer daytime {{temperatures}} in the Southwestern Interior are the hottest in Canada.

This is because their summertime temperature extremes tend to be hotter than Osoyoos and Spences Bridge (despite a slightly cooler average temperature). This heat combined with little precipitation means that arid animals and vegetation thrive. Although winter temperatures are much colder than Coastal British Columbia, this area is still milder than almost anywhere else in Canada. Southern Interior valleys, including the Okanagan Valley, are spared the incessant precipitation found on the coast, but they receive some of the lowest amounts of bright sunshine in Canada during the winter months. This is a result of winter temperature inversions that leave the valleys in a layer of thick cloud {{while the rest of the}} province basks in sunshine.|$|E
