2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Jewish Daily Forward, published on 7 October 2009, Goldstone emphasized that his task was to conduct a [...] "fact-finding mission" [...] and not an [...] "investigation". He acknowledged the reliance on Palestinian (Gazan and Hamas) testimonies, noting his mission cross-checked those accounts against each other and sought corroboration from photos, satellite photos, contemporaneous reports, forensic evidence and the mission's own inspections of the sites in question. He further acknowledged that [...] "We had to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> could with the material we had. If this were {{a court of law}} there would have been nothing proven.... I would not consider it in any way embarrassing if many of the allegations turn out to be disproved." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Mission Status Briefing, lead ISS Flight Director Ginger Kerrick {{noted that}} there was no way to know what caused the bag to come loose. [...] "We don't know that this {{incident}} occurred because they forgot to tether something. We don't know if perhaps the hook just came loose inside the bag," [...] Kerrick said. [...] "You've got to remember, we are working with humans here and we are prone to human error. We <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can, and we learn from our mistakes." [...] Kerrick noted that the team would be taking extra precautions to avoid any further problems with the grease guns, by attaching them to the outside of the bags instead of inside to prevent the plungers from being inadvertently activated.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, {{the state}} of Connecticut enacted {{legislation}} preventing physical restraint or seclusion of special needs students except in limited situations, {{largely as a result}} of allegations of mistreatment of four special education students in Wilton High School and other Wilton schools in 2005. Jill Ely claimed that, without notifying her, the school forced her intellectually disabled son into a room at the high school that was held shut until he became completely quiet. She said that her son injured his arm trying to get out and once, she later learned, [...] "he was left crying and whimpering for almost the entire day." [...] An investigation by the Wilton Bulletin in 2006 found that the high school [...] "safe room" [...] had never been inspected by the fire marshall and lacked a Building Department certificate of occupancy. Maryanne Lombardi made similar claims that her 9-year old autistic son, who did not speak, was routinely sent to a [...] "padded cell called the timeout room" [...] at another Wilton school. Gloria Bass, the grandmother of two special needs students, also said that one child had been restrained for months in a storage closet without her knowledge. Superintendent Gary Richards defended the schools’ actions saying, [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can with kids who sometimes are very challenged." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We will <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can. Even {{suppose that}} you were to tell Lucius afterwards;--you yourself! if that were necessary, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “So it seems,” Bethune {{answered}} pleasantly. “We’ll have to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can. And now, as we mustn’t take up your time, I’ll bid you good-night.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not think}} Lord Etherington would have left us so soon," [...] said Mowbray; [...] "but we must <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can without his countenance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} so, too," [...] I agreed. [...] "Never mind; <b>we</b> have <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can, {{and we are}} going to settle it up once and for all to-day. Perhaps he'll tell you about it afterward." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> could. We couldn't {{beat the}} other guy on the day, and we've got {{to shake his hand}} and say 'Well done' because that's what happened. They {{did a very good job}} and they beat us." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “If {{we were on}} {{a bigger}} label we would have done amazing things,” reminisces Kirkland. “But <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> could. I’m amazed that John Legend has decided to cover the title track of my first album, that’s very cool.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Shadrach, {{you don't}} {{know how the}} world moves. However, we'll <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can with it. But they are rich, and we are poor still!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can. We've talked it all over. My {{son will}} help me dress and I will help him. We can manage, no doubt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, lads, we must <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can. Thank God, we {{are still}} alive; so let us see whether we can't make our present {{quarters}} more comfortable." ...|$|E
50|$|I really don't {{think what}} we got was a great bargain. Nothing we {{selected}} was a real winner that I'd {{fight to the death}} for. In terms of what we had to work with, though, I think <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> could.|$|R
60|$|The {{advantage}} {{was greatly}} {{on our side}} now, and if I {{could only have been}} assured that Burnside could hold out ten days longer I should have rested more easily. But <b>we</b> were <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> could for him and the cause.|$|R

6000|$|... "'Very well,' says Bassett, 'we'll <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can. Maybe {{after dark}} I'll borrow a hairpin from some lady, {{and open the}} Farmers and Drovers Marine Bank with it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can, Mr. Creagh," [...] said he, {{interrupting}} the priest. [...] "And no {{good will}} be done {{at such a time}} as this by unnecessary difficulties." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bonilla {{defends his}} PAC's record of {{assisting}} minority candidates, saying, [...] "We <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> could."

6000|$|... "My friend," [...] he said, [...] "we <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> {{could at}} a moment's notice. I rather fancied the story myself.

6000|$|... "We have <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> might," [...] Pierre answered, {{most like}} fearing I {{would make an}} intemperate reply.

6000|$|Pratt smiled. [...] "I reckon {{that lets}} you in, stranger, ef we can come to terms. We ain't got any money to throw away, but we'll <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> kin." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I think I {{may be of}} help to you in both cases," [...] said Miss Halcombe, rising. [...] "Let us go, Mr. Hartright, at once, and <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can together." ...|$|E
5000|$|The white dancers {{eventually}} {{called the}} dance <b>the</b> black dancers <b>did</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Big Apple", after the night club where they first saw it.

5000|$|Syndicate head Michael Fay {{summed up}} the New Zealander's effort: [...] "We <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> could.

60|$|And here we three {{meet again}} as exiles on one pretext or another, {{and you will}} notice that while we are absent there is a {{pleasing}} tranquillity in America--a building up of public confidence. <b>We</b> are <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can for our country.

6000|$|... "We will <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can," [...] said Henri. [...] "If we can {{get over}} the women, and children, and wounded, {{the rest of us}} can fight our way to the bridge of Ancenis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, after this, Terence, I {{will never}} {{say a word}} against a Frenchman.

5000|$|It's {{unfortunate that}} we'll {{never get a}} chance to see how {{successful}} PiQ could have been, but a combination of low advertising revenue, poor business management and a lack of proper marketing and promotion all hamstrung the magazine from the start.

5000|$|According to Trevor Horn, Adventures in Modern Recording {{was planned}} to be more [...] "left-field" [...] than The Age of Plastic: [...] "We had some pretty weird material.
