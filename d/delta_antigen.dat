Since HBV is thought to be noncytopathic to the hepatocyte, the enhanced disease severity observed during dual infection has been attributed to either simultaneous immune responses against the two viruses or direct cytotoxic effects of HDV products on the hepatocyte or both. To examine these alternate possibilities, we produced transgenic mice that express the small and large <b>delta</b> <b>antigens</b> (HDAg) in hepatocyte nuclei at levels equal to those observed during natural HDV infection.

In an attempt to identify cellular S-HDAg-binding proteins we made use of a yeast two-hybrid approach to screen a human liver cDNA library. We were able to identify HuR, a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in RNA stabilization, as an S-HDAg partner both in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that human hepatitis virus <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> has an RNA-binding activity (Chang et al., J. Virol. 62 : 2403 - 2410, 1988). In the present study, the specificity of such an RNA-protein interaction was demonstrated by expressing various domains of the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> in Escherichia coli as TrpE fusion proteins and testing their RNA-binding activities in a Northwestern protein-RNA immunoblot assay and RNA gel mobility shift assay. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA bound specifically to the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> {{in the presence of}} an excess amount of unrelated RNAs and a relatively high salt concentration. Both genome- and antigenome-sense HDV RNAs and at least two different regions of HDV genomic RNA bound to the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen.</b> Surprisingly, these two different regions of HDV genomic RNA could compete with each other for <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> binding, although they do not have common nucleotide sequences. In contrast, this binding could not be competed with by other viral or cellular RNA. Since both the genomic and antigenomic HDV RNAs had strong intramolecular complementary sequences, these results suggest that the binding of <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> is probably specific for a secondary structure unique to the HDV RNA. By expressing different subdomains of the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen,</b> we found that the middle one-third of <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> was responsible for binding HDV RNA. Neither the N-terminal nor the C-terminal domain bound HDV RNA. Binding between the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> and HDV RNA was also demonstrated within the HDV particles isolated from the plasma of a human delta hepatitis patient. This in vivo binding resisted treatment with 0. 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0. 5 % Nonidet P- 40.

40|$|The {{replication}} of the RNA genome of {{hepatitis delta virus}} is greatly facilitated {{by the presence of}} the only known virus-coded protein, the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen.</b> Most, if not all, infections are characterized by the presence of two electrophoretic forms of the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen.</b> These forms correspond to polypeptide lengths of 195 and 214 amino acids which are encoded by genomes with different nucleotide sequences.

One interpretation of our results is that the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> normally functions as part of a multimeric structure.

Using tandem affinity purification method combined with mass spectrometry, we found that linker histone H 1 e bound to SHDAg. The binding domain of SHDAg to histone H 1 e was mapped to the N-terminal 67 amino acids. Oligomerization of SHDAg was required for its interaction with histone H 1 e. LHDAg barely bound to histone H 1 e and was masked at N-terminus. The binding domain of histone H 1 e to SHDAg was mapped to its central globular domain. HDV replication was inhibited by N- or C-terminal deletion mutants of histone H 1 e and was rescued by wild-type histone H 1 e.

40|$|AbstractHepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a sub-viral {{agent that}} is {{dependent}} for its life cycle on hepatitis B virus (HBV). The help it obtains from HBV {{is limited to}} the sharing of envelope proteins. These proteins are needed to facilitate the assembly of the HDV genome into new virus particles, and in turn, to allow the attachment and entry of HDV into new host cells. In other respects, the replication of the small single-stranded circular RNA genome of HDV is independent of HBV. HDV genome replication produces two forms of a RNA-binding protein known as the long and small <b>delta</b> <b>antigens</b> (Ag). All other proteins needed for HDV genome replication, especially the RNA-directed RNA polymerase activity, are provided by the host cell.

40|$|Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) {{infection}} of individuals infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{is associated with}} more severe liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} fulminant disease. HDV is a single-stranded RNA virus that encodes a single protein, the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen,</b> which is expressed in two forms, small (S-HDAg) and large (L-HDAg). Here we show that although HDV ribonucleoproteins are mainly detected in the nucleus, they are also present in the cytoplasm of cells infected with HDV or transfected with HDV cDNA. Making use of an heterokaryon assay, we demonstrate that HDV ribonucleoproteins shuttle continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the absence of HDV RNA, both forms of the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> are retained in the nucleus, whereas {{in the absence of the}} <b>delta</b> <b>antigen,</b> HDV RNA is predominantly detected in the cytoplasm. Coexpression of HDV RNA and S-HDAg (which binds to the viral RNA and contains a nuclear localization signal) results in nuclear accumulation of the viral RNA. This suggests that HDV RNA mediates export of viral particles to the cytoplasm whereas the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> triggers their reimport into the nucleus...|$|E

40|$|Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) {{replicates}} its genome in {{the nucleus}} of an infected cell. However, an unsolved problem has been the identification in the cytoplasm of a putative mRNA for the synthesis of the only virus-coded protein, the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen.</b> We now report the characterization of an 800 -base RNA that is cytoplasmic, polyadenylated, and antigenomic and that should direct the translation of the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen.</b> This RNA was about 500 times less abundant than full-length genomic RNA.

When an infectious cDNA clone of the whole HDV genome was changed at this site to UUUAAA, the clone was no longer infectious and it was unable to direct the synthesis of the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen.</b> These findings provided additional evidence that the polyadenylated RNA was at least the predominant method for the expression of the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen.</b> Apparently the HDV RNA was processed {{as if it were a}} host mRNA polymerase II transcript, although this did not necessarily indicate that HDV RNA was transcribed with this enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) causes both {{acute and}} chronic liver disease {{throughout}} the world. Effective medical therapy is lacking. Previous work {{has shown that}} the assembly of HDV virus-like particles (VLPs) could be abolished by BZA- 5 B, a compound with farnesyltransferase inhibitory activity. Here we show that FTI- 277, another farnesyltransferase inhibitor, prevented the production of complete, infectious HDV virions of two different genotypes. Thus, in spite of the added complexity and assembly determinants of infectious HDV virions compared to VLPs, the former are also sensitive to pharmacological prenylation inhibition. Moreover, production of HDV genotype III virions, which is associated with particularly severe clinical disease, was as sensitive to prenylation inhibition as was that of HDV genotype I virions. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors thus represent an attractive potential class of novel antiviral agents for use against HDV, including the genotypes associated with most severe disease. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a small RNA virus responsible for acute and chronic liver disease worldwide (2, 24, 25, 39, 46). As yet, no effective medical therapy exists against this pathogen.

40|$|Human {{hepatitis}} delta virus (HDV) is {{the only}} animal virus known to replicate its RNA genome using a host polymerase because its only virally encoded proteins, the small and large hepatitis <b>delta</b> <b>antigens</b> (HDAg-S and HDAg-L), lack polymerase activity. Although this makes HDV an ideal model system to study RNA-directed transcription in mammalian cells, {{little is known about}} the host factors involved in its replication. To comprehensively identify such host factors, we created a stable cell line carrying a functional FLAG–HDAg-S. Anti-Flag immunopurification and mass spectrometry identified > 100 proteins associated with FLAG–HDAg-S, many of which had predicted roles in RNA metabolism. The biological relevance of this screen was strongly supported by the identification of nine out of the 12 subunits of the RNA polymerase II complex thought to mediate HDV replication. To further investigate the significance of these factors for HDV replication, we selected 65 proteins to look for factors that would also affect the accumulation of HDV RNA following siRNA knockdown. Fifteen and three factors were found to regulate HDV RNA accumulation negatively and positively, respectively, upon RNAi knockdown. Our results provide a valuable resource for future research to advance our mechanistic understanding of HDV replication and RNA-directed transcription in mammalian cells...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is {{composed}} of four specific components. The first component is envelope protein which contains hepatitis B surface antigens. The second and third components are nucleocapsid proteins, referred to as small and large hepatitis <b>delta</b> <b>antigens</b> (HDAgs). The final component is a single-stranded circular RNA molecule known as the viral genome. In order to study the mechanism of HDV RNA packaging, a four-plasmid cotransfection system in which each viral component was provided by a separate plasmid was employed. Virus-like particles released from Huh- 7 cells receiving such a cotransfection were found to contain HDV RNA along with three proteins. Therefore, the four-plasmid cotransfection system could lead to successful HDV RNA packaging in vitro. The system was then used {{to show that the}} large HDAg alone was able to achieve a low level of HDV RNA packaging. Analysis of a variety of large HDAg mutants revealed that the RNA-binding domain was essential for viral RNA packaging. By increasing the incorporation of small HDAg into virus-like particles, we found a three- to fourfold enhancement of HDV RNA packaging. This effect was probably through a direct binding of HDV RNA, independent from that of large HDAg, with the small HDAg. The subsequent RNA-protein complex was packaged into particles. The results provided insight into the roles and functional domains of small and large HDAgs in HDV RNA packaging...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a subviral {{satellite}} {{of hepatitis}} B virus (HBV).

To examine the factors involved in such virion assembly, we transiently cotransfected cells with various hepadnavirus constructs and cDNAs of HDV and analyzed the particles released into the medium. We report that the HDV genomic RNA and the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> can be packaged by coat proteins of either HBV or the related hepadnavirus woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). Among the three co-carboxy-terminal coat proteins of WHV, the smallest form was sufficient to package the HDV genome; even {{in the absence of}} HDV RNA, the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> could be packaged by this WHV coat protein.

40|$|Infection with {{hepatitis}} delta virus (HDV) is {{an important}} cause of acute and chronic liver disease and can be rapidly fatal. Sequencing of the HDV RNA genome has revealed variability at the C-terminal end of the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> reading frame.

Another genome type (termed the L genome) extends the reading frame by 19 amino acids {{as a result of}} a single base change. Replication of the S and L genomes was studied in cultured fibroblasts. While the S genome efficiently initiated genome replication, the L genome did not. Moreover, in a codelivery experiment, L genome RNA inhibited replication of the S genome. Potent trans inhibition was also observed following cotransfection of the S genome and a plasmid encoding the larger <b>delta</b> <b>antigen.</b> Mutational analysis indicated that the inhibitory activity was not a simple function of the large <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> reading frame's extra length.

40|$|Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is hepatotropic and {{frequently}} causes fulminant hepatitis in {{both human and}} nonhuman primate hosts. To understand the molecular basis of HDV tissue tropism and the mechanism of pathogenesis, transgenic mice in which replication-competent HDV dimeric RNA is expressed {{under the control of}} either liver-specific or universal transcriptional promoters were developed. The expressed RNA replicated efficiently in the liver and several tissues of nonhepatic origin. Surprisingly, maximal replication of HDV RNA occurred in skeletal muscle and was almost 100 -fold greater than in the liver. These findings suggest that the hepatotropism of HDV is most likely a receptor-mediated restriction and that muscle-specific factors may facilitate HDV RNA replication. No evidence of cytopathology was apparent in most of the tissues examined, including the liver, supporting the contention that hepatocellular disease is not mediated by direct cytopathological effects associated with HDV RNA replication and gene expression. However, mild muscle atrophy in some of the transgenic mice was noted. <b>Delta</b> <b>antigen</b> was detected in the nuclei of myocytes. Only the small form, not the large form, of <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> was detected, suggesting that the RNA editing event which causes the conversion of <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> did not occur in transgenic mice. Furthermore, the 0. 8 -kb antigenomic RNA species, which is postulated to be the mRNA for <b>delta</b> <b>antigen,</b> was not detected in mice.

40|$|The {{functions}} of <b>delta</b> <b>antigens</b> (HDAgs) in the replication of {{hepatitis delta virus}} (HDV) have been identified previously. The small HDAg acts as a transactivator, whereas the large HDAg has {{a negative effect on}} replication. To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of HDV replication, we have established a replication system in Huh- 7 cells by cotransfecting a monomeric cDNA genome of HDV and a plasmid encoding the small HDAg. We demonstrate that a leucine repeat in the middle domain of the small HDAg is involved in binding to the HDV genome and transactivation of HDV replication. When the leucine repeat was disrupted by a substitution of valine for leucine at position 115, both RNA-binding and transactivation activity of the small HDAg were abolished. In contrast, the binding and transactivation activities were not affected when Leu- 37 and Leu- 44 of the small HDAg were replaced by valines. In addition, small and large HDAgs can interact with each other to form protein complexes in vitro. The complex formation that may lead to the trans-dominant negative regulation of large HDAg in HDV replication is mediated by a cryptic signal located between amino acid residues 35 and 65 other than the putative N-terminal leucine zipper motif. Furthermore, an extra 21 -amino-acid extension near the N terminus converts the small HDAg into a pseudo-large HDAg with negative regulation activity of HDV replication even though the extreme C-terminal residue is unchanged...|$|R
40|$|AbstractReplication of {{hepatitis}} delta virus (HDV) RNA occurs in the nuclei of infected cells. The replication is mediated by cellular factors containing an RNA polymerase II-like enzyme activity through a double rolling-circle mechanism and is regulated by <b>delta</b> <b>antigens.</b> In this study, UV cross-linking experiments were carried out to examine interactions between HDV RNA and proteins present in HeLa nuclear extract. Cellular proteins with molecular mass of 23 (p 23), 36 (p 36), 38 (p 38), and 58 (p 58) kDa bound to full-length HDV RNA of both genomic and antigenomic strands. Deletion analysis on the antigenomic strand mapped the interacting domain within a 79 -nucleotide fragment {{but not at the}} ends of the rod-shaped viral RNA structure. The specificity of the RNA-protein interactions was demonstrated by competition experiments and the specific HDV RNA-binding proteins were purified through column chromatography. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay with the purified fractions demonstrated that the interaction between p 36 and HDV RNA was relatively stable even in the presence of 0. 5 M NaCl. Biochemical analysis including protein microsequencing identified the p 36 as glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). RNase footprinting indicated that the UC-rich domain between nucleotides 379 and 414 of the HDV antigenomic RNA was involved in the GAPDH binding. Functional studies further demonstrated an enhancing effect of GAPDH on the ribozyme activity of HDV antigenomic RNA. In addition, in the presence of HDV RNA cellular GAPDH relocalized from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where HDV replication occurs. These results suggest that GAPDH is involved in the replication of HDV...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) {{contains}} {{two types of}} hepatitis <b>delta</b> <b>antigens</b> (HDAg) in the virion. The small form (S-HDAg) is required for HDV RNA replication, whereas the large form (L-HDAg) potently inhibits it by a dominant-negative inhibitory mechanism. The sequential appearance of these two forms in the infected cells regulates HDV RNA synthesis during the viral life cycle. However, the presence of almost equal amounts of S-HDAg and L-HDAg in the virion raised a puzzling question concerning how HDV can escape the inhibitory effects of L-HDAg and initiate RNA replication after infection. In this study, we examined the inhibitory effects of L-HDAg on the synthesis of various HDV RNA species. Using an HDV RNA-based transfection approach devoid of any artificial DNA intermediates, we showed that {{a small amount of}} L-HDAg is sufficient to inhibit HDV genomic RNA synthesis from the antigenomic RNA template. However, the synthesis of antigenomic RNA, including both the 1. 7 -kb HDV RNA and the 0. 8 -kb HDAg mRNA, from the genomic-sense RNA was surprisingly resistant to inhibition by L-HDAg. The synthesis of these RNAs was inhibited only when L-HDAg was in vast excess over S-HDAg. These results explain why HDV genomic RNA can initiate replication after infection even though the incoming viral genome is complexed with equal amounts of L-HDAg and S-HDAg. These results also suggest that the mechanisms of synthesis of genomic versus antigenomic RNA are different. This study thus resolves a puzzling question about the early events of the HDV life cycle...|$|R

Both the phosphorylation on serine 177 and methylation on arginine 13, of S-HDAg, {{play a critical role}} in viral RNA replication, especially in augmenting the replication of antigenomic RNA.

We expect these post-translaitonal modifications in S-HDAg may play the signal to regulate the interaction with different phosphorylated forms of RNA polymerase II. To pull down S-HDAg, both forms of RNAPII can be coimmunoprecipitated with S-HDAg, but only hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II can be coimmunoprecipitated with phosphorylated-Ser 177 S-HDAg. It is possible that Ser 177 phosphorylation of SHDAg could be a check point to transit from initiation to elongation of viral genomic replication...|$|E

Here we analyze the subcellular distribution of HDV RNA and its spatial relationship to known intranuclear structures. The human hepatoma cell line Huh 7 was stably transfected with wild-type HDV cDNA and the viral RNAs were localized by in situ hybridization and fluorescence confocal microscopy. HDV RNA is detected throughout the nucleoplasm, with additional concentration in focal structures closely associated with nuclear speckles or clusters of interchromatin granules. Both the smaller form of the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> (deltaAg-S), which is required for HDV genomic replication, and the larger form of the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> (deltaAg-L), which represses replication, co-localize with delta RNA throughout the nucleoplasm and in the foci.

Thus, {{it is unlikely that}} the delta foci represent major sites of viral transcription or replication. In conclusion, the data show that viral RNA-protein complexes accumulate in structures closely associated with interchromatin granules, a subnuclear domain highly enriched in small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, poly(A+) RNA, and RNA splicing protein factors.

40|$|Whether the {{hepatitis}} delta virus (HDV) DNA vaccine can induce anti-HDV antibodies {{has been}} debatable. The role of the isoprenylated motif of hepatitis <b>delta</b> <b>antigens</b> (HDAg) in the generation of immune responses following DNA-based immunization has never been studied. Plasmids p 2577 L, encoding large HDAg (L-HDAg), p 2577 S, expressing small HDAg (S-HDAg), and p 25 L- 211 S, encoding a mutant form of L-HDAg with a cysteine-to-serine mutation at codon 211, were constructed in this study. Mice were intramuscularly injected with the plasmids. The anti-HDV antibody titers, T-cell proliferation responses, T-helper responses, and HDV-specific, gamma interferon (IFN-γ) -producing CD 8 + T cells were analyzed. Animals immunized with p 2577 S showed a strong anti-HDV antibody response. Conversely, only a low titer of anti-HDV antibodies was detected in mice immunized with p 2577 L. Epitope mapping revealed that the anti-HDV antibodies generated by p 2577 L vaccination hardly reacted with epitope amino acids 174 to 194, located at the C terminus of S-HDAg. All of the HDAg-encoding plasmids could induce significant T-cell proliferation responses and generate Th 1 responses and HDV-specific, IFN-γ-producing CD 8 + T cells. In conclusion, HDAg-specific antibodies definitely exist following DNA vaccination. The magnitudes of the humoral immune responses generated by L-HDAg- and S-HDAg-encoding DNA vaccines are different. The isoprenylated motif can mask epitope amino acids 174 to 195 of HDAg but does not interfere with cellular immunity following DNA-based immunization.

Characterization of the hepatitis B or C viral quasispecies has provided insight into treatment failure and disease recurrence following liver transplantation, has proven useful to understand hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, and has helped to predict whether hepatitis C infection will resolve or become chronic. It is likely that characterization of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) quasispecies will ultimately have similar value for the management of this infection. This study sought to determine the RNA evolution rates in serum of chronic hepatitis delta (CHD) treatment-naïve patients, using next-generation sequencing methods. The region selected for study encompassed nucleotide positions 910 to 1270 of the genome and included the amber/W codon. Amber/W is a substrate of the editing process by the ADAR 1 host enzyme and is essential for encoding the 2 <b>delta</b> <b>antigens</b> (HDAg). The amber codon encodes the small (unedited) HDAg form and the W codon the large (edited) HDAg form. The evolution rate was analyzed taking into account the time elapsed between samples, the percentage of unedited and edited genomes, and the complexity of the viral population. The longitudinal studies included 29 sequential samples from CHD patients followed up for a mean of 11. 5 years. In total, 121, 116 sequences were analyzed. The HDV evolution rate ranged from 9. 5 x 10 - 3 to 1. 2 x 10 - 3 substitutions/site/year and showed a negative correlation with the time elapsed between samples (p< 0. 05). An accumulation of transition-type changes was found to be responsible for higher evolution rates. The percentages of unedited and edited genomes and the quasispecies complexity showed no relationships with the evolution rate, but the fluctuations in the percentages of genomes and in complexity suggest continuous adaptation of HDV to the host conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{frequency}} of gamma delta+ cells and their subsets has been assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell populations recovered from 51 patients at various clinical stages of HIV- 1 infection. Thirteen out of the 51 HIV- 1 -infected patients showed {{an increase in the}} percentage of TCR delta 1 + BAL T cells (25. 5 %). BAL lymphocytes bearing pan-gamma <b>delta</b> <b>antigens</b> were also quantitatively increased in 10 patients (19. 6 %). A strict correlation was observed between the degree of CD 8 alveolitis and the increase of gamma delta T cells. Phenotypic study of BAL gamma delta cells revealed that (a) V delta 2 -related BB 3 + cells accounted for the majority of lung gamma delta T cells; (b) these cells were CD 45 RO+ memory cells and expressed a series of adhesion molecules; and (c) 29 % of BAL gamma delta T cells expressed CD 8 surface molecules. We also compared the distribution of V delta 2 and V delta 1 subsets in paired samples of peripheral blood and BAL fluid. Patients who showed an increased number of BB 3 + cells in the BAL fluid presented a reversal of the V delta 2 to V delta 1 cell ratio in the peripheral blood. By contrast, in the lung of normal subjects pulmonary BB 3 + and A 13 + cells were present in approximately the same proportions found in the peripheral blood. Taken together these data demonstrate that a redistribution of T cells expressing V delta 2 TCR takes place in the lung of a subset of patients with HIV- 1 infection and CD 8 alveolitis. In the pulmonary microenvironment these cells might {{play a role in the}} local immune response against HIV- 1 and/or opportunistic infections...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis delta virus expresses two {{essential}} proteins, {{the small}} and large delta antigens, and both are required for viral propagation. Proper function of each protein depends {{on the presence of}} a common amino-terminal multimerization domain. A crystal structure, solved using a peptide fragment that contained residues 12 to 60, depicts the formation of an octameric ring composed of antiparallel coiled-coil dimers. Because this crystal structure was solved for only a fragment of the delta antigens, it is unknown whether octamers actually form in vivo at physiological protein concentrations and in the context of either intact <b>delta</b> <b>antigen.</b> To test the relevance of the octameric structure, we developed a new method to probe coiled-coil structures in vivo. We generated a panel of mutants containing cysteine substitutions at strategic locations within the predicted monomer-monomer interface and the dimer-dimer interface. Since the small <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> contains no cysteine residues, treatment of cell extracts with a mild oxidizing reagent was expected to induce disulfide bond formation only when the appropriate pairs of cysteine substitution mutants were coexpressed. We indeed found that, in vivo, both {{the small and}} large delta antigens assembled as antiparallel coiled-coil dimers. Likewise, we found that both proteins could assume an octameric quaternary structure in vivo. Finally, during the course of these experiments, we found that unprenylated large <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> molecules could be disulfide cross-linked via the sole cysteine residue located within the carboxy terminus. Therefore, in vivo, the C terminus likely provides an additional site of protein-protein interaction for the large <b>delta</b> <b>antigen...</b>|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} but not acute {{hepatitis}} delta virus infection undergo a strong accumulation of a protein of cellular origin which specifically reacts with a panel of anti-c-myc antibodies and which is expressed in the same nuclei that express the <b>delta</b> <b>antigen.</b> In this paper {{we report on the}} in vitro characterization of this phenomenon. The <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> induced c-myc antigen accumulation can occur in vitro upon transfection of HBsAg positive and negative cell lines with HDAg expression vectors. Using recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing only p 24 or p 27 we demonstrate that structures common to the two isoforms of HDAg are responsible for the phenomenon, which is not restricted to cells of hepatic origin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the unusual finding of <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> in the serum {{of a significant}} number of drug users in Dublin during 1981. The study followed a significant increase in hepatitis B among drug-users in that year. One hundred and fifty-eight cases of hepatitis B were detected among drug users in Dublin between January and August 1981 during an epidemic which began in 1980. The mean age was 21 years and males and females were equally susceptible to hepatitis B. An unusually high proportion (29 %) of a sample of 50 tested had the hepatitis B associated <b>delta</b> <b>antigen</b> in their serum and confirms that the delta agent is probably common in those taking drugs intravenously...|$|E
40|$|The {{functions}} of <b>delta</b> <b>antigens</b> (HDAgs) in the morphogenesis of {{hepatitis delta virus}} (HDV) have been studied previously. The C terminus of large HDAg {{has been shown to}} complex with the small surface antigen (HBsAg) of helper hepatitis B virus, whereas the assembly of small HDAg requires interaction with the N terminus of large HDAg (M. -F. Chang, C. -J. Chen, and S. C. Chang, J. Virol. 68 : 646 - 653, 1994). To further examine the molecular mechanisms by which HDAgs are involved in the assembly of HDV RNA, we have cotransfected Huh- 7 cells with plasmids representing a longer than unit-length HDV and the small HBsAg cDNAs. We found that HDAg mRNA could be generated from an endogenous promoter within the HDV cDNA that was translated into large HDAg. Large HDAg is capable of complexing with monomeric HDV genomic RNA to form ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) and is capable of forming enveloped HDV-like particles in the presence of small HBsAg without undergoing HDV replication. In addition, the middle region from amino acid residues 89 to 145 of large HDAg is required for assembly of the RNPs but is dispensable for assembly of the enveloped particles. RNA assembly is also demonstrated with small HDAg when it is cotransfected with a packaging-defective large HDAg mutant and small HBsAg. Leu- 115 within the putative helix-loop-helix structure of the small HDAg is important for the replication of HDV but is not essential for RNA assembly, suggesting that conformational requirements of small HDAg for replication and assembly of viral RNA may be different. Further studies indicate that a 312 -nucleotide linear HDV RNA {{from one end of the}} HDV and structure is sufficient to form RNP complexes competent for assembly of virus-like particles with large HDAg and small HBsAg...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effects of heat shock on T-cell induction and selection in vitro. We find that when cell preparations containing T lymphocytes are incubated for 30 min at 42 degrees C, a selective proliferation of gamma delta + T cells bearing the gamma <b>delta</b> T-cell <b>antigen</b> receptor follows. A greater enrichment of gamma delta + T cells is observed, upon preexposure to mycobacterial antigens in vivo. By comparing the effects of heat shock with that of mitogen or specific T-cell triggering by conventional antigens and by analyzing the gamma delta T-cell receptor genes expressed in cells that proliferate {{as a result of}} heat shock induction, we conclude that a subset of murine gamma delta T cells react to antigens on self cells in which a heat shock response was induced...|$|R
40|$|Vertebrate {{immune systems}} contain T cells bearing either alpha beta or gamma <b>delta</b> T-cell <b>antigen</b> receptors (TCRs). alpha beta T cells perform all well-characterized T-cell {{effector}} functions, while the biological functions of gamma delta + cells remain unclear. Of particular {{interest is the}} role of gamma delta + cells during epithelial infections, since gamma delta + cells are commonly abundant within epithelia. Eimeria spp. are intracellular protozoa that infect epithelia of most vertebrates, causing coccidiosis. This study shows that in response to Eimeria vermiformis, mice lacking alpha beta T cells display defects in protective immunity, while mice lacking gamma delta + cells display exaggerated intestinal damage, apparently due to a failure to regulate the consequences of the alpha beta T cell response. An immuno-downregulatory role during infection, and during autoimmune disease, may be a general one for gamma delta + cells...|$|R
