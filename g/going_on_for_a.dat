[...] Daoud Sultanzoi, {{a member of the}} Afghan parliament, said, he had observed that disagreement between Karzai on the one side and cabinet members such as Saleh and Atmar on the other side had been <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. Saleh publicly blamed Pakistan for its support to the Taliban and other extremist groups and said talks with the Taliban should take place but not at the cost of democratic structures. Meanwhile, Karzai had increasingly been placing his hopes on his attempts to reach a secret deal with the Taliban and Pakistan. Pakistan had repeatedly urged Karzai to oust Saleh from his position.|$|E

Wyatt Earp (who was not wearing a badge) encouraged his brother, Tombstone Deputy City Marshal Morgan Earp, to intervene. Morgan escorted Holliday {{out onto the street}} and Ike, who had been drinking steadily, followed them. City Marshal Virgil Earp arrived a few minutes later and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing. Ike and Wyatt talked again a few minutes later, and Ike threatened to confront Holliday in the morning. Ike told Earp that the fighting talk had been <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time and that he intended {{to put an end to}} it. Ike told Earp, [...] "I will be ready for you in the morning." [...] Wyatt Earp walked over to the Oriental Saloon and Ike followed him.

500|$|On 15 June 2015, Reuters {{reported}} that Airbus was discussing a stretched {{version of the}} A380 with a half dozen customers. [...] This aircraft, which could also feature new engines, would accommodate an additional fifty passengers. [...] Deliveries to customers were planned for sometime in 2020 or 2021. [...] On 19 July 2015, Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier stated that the company will build {{a new version of}} the A380 featuring new improved wings and new engines. Speculation about the development of a so-called A380neo (neo for new engine option) had been <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few months after earlier press releases in 2014, and in 2015 the company was considering whether to end production of the type prior to 2018 or develop a new A380 variant. Later it was revealed that Airbus was looking at both the possibility of a longer A380 in line of the previously planned A380-900 and a new engine version, i.e. A380neo. [...] Brégier also revealed that the new variant would be ready to enter service by 2020. The engine would most likely be one of a variety of all-new options from Rolls-Royce, ranging from derivatives of the A350's XWB-84/97 to the future Advance project due at around 2020.|$|E

The Complete X-Files noted that many fans were [...] "ecstatic" [...] about Mulder and Scully's [...] "long-awaited" [...] kiss. David Blar from DVD Talk called the episode [...] "shocking" [...] because of Mulder and Scully's kiss, asking, [...] "why they didn't lock lips sooner"? Paula Vitaris {{noted that the}} kiss [...] "seems stuck on to the episode by a tack in its {{complete}} irrelevance to the storyline or Mulder and Scully in general." [...] Allan Johnson from the Chicago Tribune noted that [...] "in a way, it's too bad Sunday's episode of Fox's The X-Files is getting more attention for what happens near the end than it does for its plot." [...] Kessenich praised the way the show worked in Mulder and Scully's kiss, noting that its lack of a [...] "steamy, rip your clothes off" [...] atmosphere made the sequence work [...] "so well". Handlen wrote that the scene, coupled with Black getting his daughter back, was [...] "the only scene which comes close to justifying the episode’s existence". Furthermore, he enjoyed the ambiguous nature of the kiss, noting {{that it could be}} [...] "just a one time thing, or maybe it’s the start of something, or maybe it’s just a continuation of something that’s been <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time now, right under our noses." ...|$|E

2500|$|UKC {{apparently}} had another registration <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> type of [...] "farm shepherd" [...] that was {{separate from the}} English Shepherd. Many times the names were confused but at other times they were distinguished as different breeds. All of these names as well as Farm Collie were applied to the farm shepherds of the era. As there was no breed club or registry until later, there is some dispute over exactly which name applies to which dogs. Australian Shepherd is likely a derivative of these farm dogs and appeared primarily in the Western United States. The English Shepherd {{on the other hand}} was more common in the Midwest and East. These dogs are primarily descendants of the working farm dogs of England.|$|E
2500|$|The large {{severance}} payments {{given to}} departing BBC executives came to widespread media attention in 2013 when the National Audit Office conducted {{an investigation into}} BBC senior management pay.

Senior executives whose payments were criticised included: chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, who received a total of £680,400 on her departure in 2011; Deputy Director-General Mark Byford who also left the BBC in 2011, taking £949,000; CEO of BBC Worldwide John Smith who was paid a total of £1,031,000 in 2011 (he later returned £205,000); George Entwistle who left the Director-General job after only 54 days following the Savile crisis, and received a payment of £511,500; and Roly Keating, the Head of BBC Archives, who received a £375,000 severance payment in 2012 (which he later repaid in full). Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, criticised the practice, calling it an [...] "outrageous waste of licence fee payers' money." [...] Following his appointment as Director General, Lord Hall introduced a £150,000 cap on severance payments. Mark Thompson stated to the PAC that the payments had been fully approved by the BBC Trust.|$|E
2500|$|FOR over 20 {{years the}} work of cross-fertilising crop plants, with the object of {{producing}} New and Improved Breeds, has been carried on at Newton-le-Willows in Lancashire. It has there {{for the first time}} been demonstrated to Scientific Botanists as well as to Agriculturists that all the corn crops (cereals) and nearly all the other common crops of the farm are self fertilising. In other words, each individual plant provides the pollen which is required in the process of producing seed, to fertilise the female organs of its own flowers. This natural process results in a perfect system of in-breeding which has been <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> indefinite period, making it possible to grow the different varieties of crops of the same kind in close proximity to each other, and even as mixed crops without any danger of crosses being produced.|$|R
