40|$|Micro-cracks in {{tin oxide}} thin film may cause bad {{stability}} to the micro-hotplate (MHP) gas sensor, especially at high operation temperature or in moisture ambience. In {{order to reduce}} micro-cracks, tin oxide thin films on a 2 x 2 MHP gas sensor array are patterned as <b>narrow</b> <b>strips.</b> It is proved by SEM that micro-cracks induced by thermal stress can be greatly restrained in <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> shape films comparing with the traditional rectangle board film. Stability of the MHP sensors with <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> films was characterized by testing their resistance in air for 60 h, and their responses respectively to methane and carbon monoxide for 300 h. The {{results show that the}} strip shape SnO 2 films are really helpful to enhance stability of the MHP gas sensors. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
