5|$|Herdwicks are a <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>breed,</b> {{producing}} strongly flavoured {{lamb and}} mutton and a coarse, grey wool. This slowly maturing breed {{is one of}} the most hardy of all the British hill sheep breeds, withstanding the cold and relentless rain of the Lake District at heights upwards of 3,000 feet (about 1,000 metres). Most Herdwicks spend winter on the fells, from approximately December to April. They are normally left to graze freely on the hillsides (without any additional feed), but each ewe tends to stay in her heaf (the local term for heft), the same small area of fell. Due to the rough conditions on fells, lambing losses can be as high as 25%. This ability to thrive unassisted is part of the reason fell farmers so highly value Herdwicks over much higher-producing lowland breeds.|$|E
500|$|The {{domestic}} sheep is a multi-purpose animal, {{and the more}} than 200 breeds now in existence were created to serve these diverse purposes. Some sources give a count of a thousand or more breeds, but these numbers cannot be verified, according to some sources. However, several hundred breeds of sheep have been identified by the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN), with the estimated number varying somewhat from time to time: e.g. 863 breeds as of 1993, 1314 breeds as of 1995 [...] and 1229 breeds as of 2006. (These numbers exclude extinct breeds, which are also tallied by the FAO.) For the purpose of such tallies, the FAO definition of a breed is [...] "either a subspecific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity." [...] Almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product: wool, meat, milk, hides, or a combination in a <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>breed.</b> Other features used when classifying sheep include face color (generally white or black), tail length, presence or lack of horns, and the topography for which the breed has been developed. This last point is especially stressed in the UK, where breeds are described as either upland (hill or mountain) or lowland breeds. A sheep may also be of a fat-tailed type, which is a dual-purpose sheep common in Africa and Asia with larger deposits of fat within and around its tail.|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} demand for and supply of organic milk. This results in more organic steers being produced. Many organic steer calves are sold to {{non-organic}} producers or are destroyed at birth. This is a serious issue for the organic dairy sector. This report also {{provides an overview of}} the current situation of the meat from the organic dairy sector, identifies opportunities for improving the marketing of organic dairy steer calves and provides a special focus on the use of <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>breeds.</b> <b>Dual-purpose</b> <b>breeds</b> were more often used in the past. Some organic dairy producers have returned to using <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>breeds</b> such as the MRI (Maas Rijn Ijssel) and the Shorthorn. Stakeholder interviews showed that the high milk price makes the dairy farmers focus merely on milk production and not on finishing the steer calves. Rearing calves for 12 weeks on organic milk, lacking infrastructure/ buildings and shortage of land seem to be the main barriers for organic dairy producers to finishing organic dairy steer calves. The Red Meat Industry Forum has stressed the opportunities for finishing organic dairy steer calves as organic beef demand continues to outstrip supply. Case studies show that by using dual purpose breeds in an organic dairy farming system there is a small reduction of the litres milk produced but also a reduction of the total costs (by reducing the replacement costs). It is shown that the Profitability of an organic dairy system using <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>breeds</b> can be similar or slightly higher. In addition, the profitability of finishing dual-purpose steer calves seems to be interesting. Recommendations 1. There is more research needed about the economics of finishing dual-purpose steer calves. 2. Information about systems using <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>breeds</b> should be widely spread. 3. Finishing organic dairy steer calves should not be seen as a temporary solution to producing/ finishing organic beef. There is a need to develop a permanent solution/market 4. Awareness needs to be raised amongst organic dairy producers about opportunities of finishing of organic dairy animals, as there is little knowledge amongst the organic dairy producers interviewed about the market and price for organic meat from the organic dairy sector...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} if genomic variations associated with fatty acid (FA) composition are similar between the Holstein-Friesian (HF) and native <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>breeds</b> used in the Dutch dairy industry. Phenotypic and genotypic information were available for the breeds Meuse-Rhine-Yssel (MRY), Dutch Friesian (DF), Groningen White Headed (GWH), and HF. First, the reliability of genomic breeding values of the native Dutch <b>dual-purpose</b> cattle <b>breeds</b> MRY, DF, and GWH was evaluated using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects estimated in HF, including all SNP or subsets with stronger associations in HF. Second, the genomic variation of the regions associated with FA composition in HF (regions on Bos taurus autosome 5, 14, and 26), were studied in the different breeds. Finally, similarities in genotype and allele frequencies between MRY, DF, GWH, and HF breeds were assessed for specific regions associated with FA composition. On average across the traits, the highest reliabilities of genomic prediction were estimated for GWH (0. 158) and DF (0. 116) when the 8 to 22 SNP with the strongest association in HF were included. With the same set of SNP, GEBV for MRY were the least reliable (0. 022). This indicates that on average only 2 (MRY) to 16 % (GWH) of the genomic variation in HF is shared with the native Dutch <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>breeds.</b> The comparison of predicted variances of different regions associated with milk and milk fat composition showed that breeds clearly differed in genomic variation within these regions. Finally, the correlations of allele frequencies between breeds across the 8 to 22 SNP with the strongest association in HF were around 0. 8 between the Dutch native <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>breeds,</b> whereas the correlations between the native breeds and HF were clearly lower and around 0. 5. There was no consistent relationship between the reliabilities of genomic prediction for a specific breed and the correlation between the allele frequencies of this breed and HF. In conclusion, most of the genomic variation associated with FA composition in the Dutch <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>breeds</b> appears to be breed-specific. Furthermore, the minor allele frequencies of genes having an effect on the milk FA composition in HF were shown to be much smaller in the breeds MRY, DF, and GWH, especially for the MRY breed...|$|R

Sheep Experimental Station from 1978 through 1998, confirmed previous analyses of three other <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>breeds</b> that cytoplasmic effects do not contribute to variation in these four traits. In general, estimates of genetic parameters that would be needed for national genetic evaluation were similar to previous estimates for Columbia, Rambouillet, and Targhee sheep, although estimates of direct heritability for Polypay were somewhat less for birth weight, slightly greater for weaning weight, significantly greater for fleece weight, and the same for number born as for those three breeds.

A comparative analysis between the identified sheep CNVRs and those reported in cattle and goat genomes indicated that overlaps between sheep and both other species CNVRs are highly significant (P< 0. 0001), suggesting that several chromosome regions might contain recurrent interspecies CNVRs.

40|$|Beef {{production}} from cull cows {{is an additional}} {{source of income for}} dairy farms and greatly contributes to red meat production, but the sources of variation of live animal characteristics and the carcass traits of cull cows have rarely been examined. This study investigated the effects of the farm type, breed, age at slaughter (AGE) and calving to culling interval (Calv_Cull) on the body traits and carcass characteristics of dairy and dual-purpose cull cows. Data from 555 cull cows from 182 herds belonging to five farm types, characterised by a combination of housing and feeding systems, were recorded and analysed. Dairy breeds, such as Holstein Friesian and Brown Swiss, and <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>breeds</b> (Simmental, Rendena) were included in the trait assessments. The day before slaughter, the cows were weighed and scored for body condition (BCS) and fleshiness, and then, their heart girth and wither height were measured. At the slaughterhouse, the carcass weight (CW), dressing percentage (DP), carcass conformation and fatness scores, carcass price per kg and carcass total value were obtained. On average, the cows were slaughtered at nearly 71 Â± 27 months of age, 285 Â± 187 days after the last calving; 615 Â± 95 kg BW; and provided a 257 Â± 51 kg CW. Nearly 50 % of the cows fell within the BCS range of 2. 75 to 3. 50, and the carcasses were mostly graded in the lowest class of conformation and fatness scores. Cull cows from free-stall farms had a higher DP, carcass conformation score and price than those from traditional tie-stall farms. The breed influenced the AGE, live animal characteristics and carcass traits. Cows from dairy breeds were younger at slaughter, had a lower BCS and fleshiness, and greater body measurements, but a lower DP and carcass price than those from <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>breeds,</b> although differences between the breeds were found within both groups. The age of the cows at slaughter influenced the Calv_Cull and increased the BW, body measurements and CW, but not the fleshiness and fatness appreciation (both in vivo and postmortem) or carcass price. The increasing Calv_Cull improved the BW, BCS, fleshiness, CW and carcass conformation and fatness. In conclusion, the decision to cull dairy cows should also take into account the factors that affect their carcass value in regards to improving the carcass price of cows...|$|R
