5|$|Groups share a {{fundamental}} kinship {{with the notion}} of symmetry. For example, a symmetry group encodes symmetry features of a geometrical object: the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other. Lie <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> the symmetry groups used in the Standard Model of particle physics; Poincaré groups, which are also Lie groups, can express the physical symmetry underlying special relativity; and point <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> used to help understand symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry.|$|E

5|$|In Anglophone countries, Heathen <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} called kindreds or hearths, or alternately {{sometimes as}} fellowships, tribes, or garths. These are small groups, often family units, and usually consist of {{between five and}} fifteen members. They are often bound together by oaths of loyalty, with strict screening procedures regulating the admittance of new members. Prospective members may undergo a probationary period before they are fully accepted and welcomed into the group, while other groups remain closed to all new members. Heathen <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> largely independent and autonomous, although they typically network with other Heathen groups, particularly in their region. There are other followers of the religion who are not affiliated with such groups, operating as solitary practitioners, with these individuals often remaining in contact with other practitioners through social media.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that every R-factorizable <b>group</b> <b>is</b> ω-narrow, but not vice versa. One of the main {{problems}} regarding R-factorizable <b>groups</b> <b>is</b> whether this class of <b>groups</b> <b>is</b> closed under taking continuous homomorphic images or, alternatively, whether every ω-narrow <b>group</b> <b>is</b> a continuous homomorphic image of an R-factorizable group. Here we show that the second hypothesis is definitely false. This result follows from the theorem stating that if a continuous homomorphic image of an R-factorizable <b>group</b> <b>is</b> a P-group, then the image is also R-factorizable...|$|R

5|$|Like the {{fundamental}} group or the higher homotopy groups of a space, homology <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> important topological invariants. Although some (co)homology theories are computable using tools of linear algebra, many other important (co)homology theories, especially singular (co)homology, are not computable directly from their definition for nontrivial spaces. For singular (co)homology, the singular (co)chains and (co)cycles <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> often {{too big to}} handle directly. More subtle and indirect approaches become necessary. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is such an approach, giving partial information about the (co)homology groups of any space by relating it to the (co)homology groups of two of its subspaces and their intersection.|$|E
