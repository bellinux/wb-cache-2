He saw Joplin's psychedelically painted Porsche 356 C Cabriolet in the parking lot. Upon entering Joplin's room (#105), he found her dead on the floor beside her bed. The official cause of death was a heroin overdose, possibly compounded by alcohol. Cooke believes Joplin had been given heroin that was much more potent than normal, as several of her dealer's other customers also overdosed that week.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn [R. Colpi, K. R. <b>Fuller,</b> <b>Tilting</b> {{objects in}} abelian {{categories}} and quasitilted rings, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., in press] tilting objects in an arbitrary abelian category H are introduced and are shown {{to yield a}} version of the classical tilting theorem between H and the category of modules over their endomorphism rings. Moreover, it is shown that given any faithful torsion theory (X,Y) in Mod-R, for a ring R, the corresponding Heart H(X,Y) is an abelian category admitting a tilting object which yields a tilting theorem between the Heart and Mod-R. In this paper we first prove that H(X,Y) is a prototype for any abelian category H admitting a tilting object which tilts to (X,Y) in Mod-R. Then we study AB-type properties of the Heart and commutations with direct limits. This allows us to show, for instance, that any abelian category H with a tilting object is AB 4, and to find necessary and sufficient conditions which guarantee that H is a Grothendieck or even a module category. As particular situations, we examine two main cases: when (X,Y) is hereditary cotilting, proving that H(X,Y) is Grothendieck and when (X,Y) is tilting, proving that H(X,Y) is a module category...|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} in the ‘Background’ section, although in our previous study, approximately 25 % of boron carbide nanowires appear to be planar defect-free based on the <b>full</b> range of <b>tilting</b> examination, we are wondering whether these nanowires are really without any planar defects. Recently, using the reposition-reexamination process described in the ‘Methods’ section, we clarified this issue. Figure  1 e is a low magnification TEM image of a boron carbide nanowire. An initial <b>full</b> range of <b>tilting</b> examination suggests that the nanowire is planar defect-free, as shown in Figure  1 f. However, after repositioning the nanowire (Figure  1 g) and reexamination, the ‘hidden’ planar defects are revealed in Figure  1 h and the nanowire is identified as an AF nanowire. This example further demonstrates {{that the existence of}} planar defects cannot be fully revealed by observation from one single zone axis. Moreover, in specific occasions, even after a <b>full</b> range of <b>tilting</b> examination limited by the configuration of a microscope, there is still a possibility of neglecting the existence of planar defects. In our current study, twenty five planar defect-free-like nanowires were subjected to multiple rounds of reposition and reexamination, and planar defects were seen from all of them eventually. This new finding strongly suggests that planar defects exist in all of our as-synthesized boron carbide nanowires. However, these defects are not always visible from routine characterization.|$|R
30|$|Boron carbide 1 D {{nanostructures}} {{have attracted}} increasing {{attention in the}} last few years because of their potential applications in nanocomposites and thermoelectric energy conversion [16 – 25]. Most reported boron carbide 1 D nanostructures were synthesized by carbothermal reduction or chemical vapor deposition at approximately 1, 100 °C [16 – 23]. Field emission [18, 23], photoluminescence [19], mechanical [21, 23], and thermal conductivity [22] properties of these 1 D nanostructures were reported. However, due to the complicated rhombohedral crystal structure, detailed structural characterization especially on planar defects that could greatly affect the properties of boron carbide 1 D nanostructures has not yet gained enough attention, and the structure–property relations have not been established. In our previous study [22], about one hundred as-synthesized boron carbide nanowires were subjected to TEM study, during which each nanowire was examined throughout the <b>full</b> <b>tilting</b> range allowed by the configuration of our microscope. Approximately 75 % examined nanowires were found to have planar defects, while the remaining 25 % were planar defect-free-like. The defected nanowires were further categorized into two groups: transverse faults (TF) nanowires with planar defects perpendicular to the preferred growth direction of nanowires and axial faults (AF) nanowires with planar defects parallel to the preferred growth direction of nanowires. The determination of defects’ existence and fault orientations (TF or AF) within each nanowire was based on the characteristic features presented in TEM results, including modulated contrast in high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and streaks in diffraction patterns.|$|R
