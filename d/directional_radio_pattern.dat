50|$|The Adcock antenna is {{an antenna}} array {{consisting}} of four equidistant vertical elements {{which can be}} used to transmit or receive <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> waves.|$|R
50|$|At time of {{completion}} it was, {{together with the}} since-demolished mast of the Berlin-Frohnau radio relay station, the tallest structure in former West Germany, and served together with the 327-metre mast for a <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> link to West Berlin. The terminal in Berlin for the link starting from the 327-metre tower was Berlin Telecommunication Tower, and for the link starting from the 344-metre tower, the terminal was the Berlin-Frohnau radio relay station. For these links, both masts were equipped with <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> antennas; on the smaller mast, dipole antennas with reflectors were installed, while on the larger mast, conventional antennas for <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> links mounted on platforms were used. Because structures used for carrying <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> links have to withstand great wind forces, as such antennas cause high wind loads, both masts are of a very strong design and anchored by double guys. The larger mast, which is today used mainly for FM-broadcasting, meteorological measurements and carbon dioxide monitoring, is equipped with several closed cabinets for technical equipment. The upmost of these cabinets is situated at a height of 325 metres, making it the highest closed room on a man-made structure in the European Union. The smaller mast also carried a small cabinet on its lower section.|$|R
50|$|On the Krehberg {{there is}} a {{transmission}} tower for FM, TV and <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> services, consisting of a lattice tower with a guyed mast on the top.|$|R

50|$|Felsenegg-Girstel has a {{triangular}} form with smoothed edges, is 51 m high {{and has a}} 22 m high pole on his top. It has 16 floors and an underground building for technical equipment. The antennas are on the terraces of the 5 top floors and on the roof. For its <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> system there are parabolic antennas, horn and shell antennas. The power for <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> is quite small {{in comparison to the}} Uetliberg TV-tower: 10W at the maximum for a connection from Felsenegg to Chasseral of about 110 km.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the REIN can be traced by using a <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> {{frequency}} analyzer, {{as the source of}} the REIN is often broadcasting interference on 612 kHz (AM).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} general {{classification}} of the dual <b>directional</b> mobile <b>radio</b> channel based on simple dispersion metrics.

50|$|Partially guyed towers {{can be used}} e.g. when a {{very high}} tower for FM and TV {{transmission}} is required, which should also carry antennas for <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> services in a much lower height. In this cases the antennas for <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> services are mounted {{on the top of}} the free-standing part of the tower, while the guyed mast on its top carry the FM and TV antennas.They can be also used in order to upgrade small stable towers (like watertowers) with a long antenna mast for FM and TV broadcasting.However their use is rare, and done only in some European countries.|$|R

25|$|Both the TMA-1 and the TMA-2 produce occasional, powerful, <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> {{transmission}}s. TMA-2 sends a {{radio transmission}} towards a star system about 450 {{light years away}} in the 22nd century. However, only TMA-1 ever exhibited any strong magnetic fields.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, a {{television}} broadcasting antenna was installed on Petřínská rozhledna, the program feed {{performed by a}} <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> antenna. This served as Prague's main television signal provider until {{the opening of the}} Žižkov Television Tower in late 1992.|$|R
50|$|By {{using the}} large masts of the Gartow-Höbeck {{transmitter}} and the Berlin-Frohnau radio relay station, the first direct <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> link between former West Germany and Berlin could be realized. This link was in service until German reunification in 1990.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{broadcasting}} facilities in Berlin, {{more than in}} other comparable cities. This is because Berlin was a divided city from 1961 to 1989 and because the Allies built their own broadcasting facilities in each sector. Further there was the necessity for a <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> service to West Berlin.|$|R
5000|$|South of the {{facility}} on a hill at 49°37'28" [...] N and 12°6'55" [...] E there is a 55 meters tall free-standing lattice tower, which was built in 1973. It is used for <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> links for remote controlling Etzenricht substation and GKK Etzenricht, which are both not permanently manned.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{closed in}} 1992 {{and only one}} of the radio masts now remains.
