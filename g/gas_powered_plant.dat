40|$|The study {{evaluates the}} energy {{consumption}} of both {{wet and dry}} processes cement manufacturing plant in Nigeria. En- ergy consumption data collected for the period 2003 to 2011 were used to estimate the energy consumption of the crushing, milling, agitation, burning, grinding and bagging operations. The total energy evaluation {{was based on the}} three primary energy sources which include electrical, combustion and human. The total estimated energy intensities were 6545 MJ/ton and 4197 MJ/ton for wet and dry processes respectively. The percentage consumption of energy in each operation is 93. 68 and 90. 34 % (burning), 2. 11 and 4. 33 % (milling), 0. 43 and 0. 67 % (crushing), 1. 39 and 0 % (agi- tation), 2. 12 and 3. 90 % (grinding), and 0. 27 and 0. 75 % (bagging) of the total energy inputs for the wet and dry proc- esses respectively. Furthermore, the average total energy cost of production showed that wet process is approximately 40 % more cost intensive in cement production than the dry process {{while at the same time}} it is cost effective to run production on energy through <b>gas</b> <b>powered</b> <b>plant</b> than the national grid...|$|E

40|$|This study {{recommends}} a GIS-based (Geographic Information Systems) and multi-criteria evaluation for site selection of <b>gas</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> in Natanz City of Iran. The multi-criteria decision framework integrates legal requirements and physical constraints related to {{environmental and economic}} concerns. It also builds a hierarchy model for <b>gas</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> suitability. The methodologies used for site selection include analytic hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy set theory and weighted linear combination. The AHP (analytic hierarchy process) is a multi-criteria approach {{which is used to}} establish the relative importance of criteria. The AHP makes pair-wise comparisons of relative importance between hierarchy elements categorized by environmental decision criteria. In the next step, the fuzzy set theory is used to standardize criteria through different fuzzy membership functions and fuzzy layers are formed by using fuzzy operators in ArcGIS environment. Subsequently, they are categorized into 6 classes using Reclassify Function. Weighted linear combination is used to combine the criteria layers. Finally, the two approaches are analyzed in order to locate the most suitable site to establish a <b>gas</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> According to the results, using GAMMA fuzzy operator is considered suitable for this site selection...|$|R
