2500|$|The Bush {{administration}} reportedly {{went out}} of its way to make the transition as seamless as possible for the incoming administration, earning accolades from Obama staff members and outside experts alike. According to nearly all accounts, the Bush administration streamlined the process for new officials to obtain security clearances and planned training exercises for the incoming national security team, to ensure that they would be ready to face a possible crisis on the first day in office. Part of this <b>enhanced</b> <b>cooperation</b> is required by laws passed at the behest of the 9/11 Commission, while part is attributed to the difficulty that the Bush administration had with its own transition, which lasted only five weeks and was felt to have had a deleterious effect on Bush's ability to govern.

50|$|The Schengen Agreement {{adoption}} {{is considered a}} historical inspiration for formalising the mechanism of <b>Enhanced</b> <b>cooperation.</b> It was created by European Communities member states only, but outside of its structures, in part owing {{to the lack of}} consensus amongst all members over whether it had the competence to abolish border controls, and in part because those ready to implement the idea did not wish to wait for others. As there was no <b>Enhanced</b> <b>cooperation</b> mechanism back then it was impossible to establish it inside the Community structures from the start, but afterwards the Schengen Agreement was subsumed into European Union law by the Treaty of Amsterdam as the rules of the Schengen Area.
