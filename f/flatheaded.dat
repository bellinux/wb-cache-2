50|$|Dicerca tenebrica (commonly {{known as}} <b>flatheaded</b> wood borer) is a brassy to black {{coloured}} beetle from Chrysochroinae subfamily {{which can be}} found in Canada and both Southern and Northeastern United States.|$|E
50|$|The hickory {{bark beetle}} (Scolytus quadrispinosus) feeds in the cambium and seriously weakens or even kills some trees. Adults of the hickory spiral borer (Agrilus arcuatus torquatus) feed on leaves, but the larvae feed beneath the bark {{and can be}} very {{destructive}} to hickory seedlings. The <b>flatheaded</b> appletree borer (Chrysobothris femorata) likewise is a foliage-feeder as an adult, but its larvae feed on the phloem and outer sapwood.|$|E
50|$|Ten {{species of}} <b>flatheaded</b> borers {{of the family}} Buprestidae feed on spruce and fir, but hemlock is their {{preferred}} food source (Rose and Lindquist 1985). As with roundheaded borers, most feeding occurs in dying or dead trees, or close to injuries on living trees. Damage becomes abundant only where a continuing supply of breeding material is available. The life history of these borers {{is similar to that}} of the roundheaded borers, but some exceedingly long life cycles have been reported under adverse conditions. Full-grown larvae, up to 25 mm long, are characteristically flattened, the anterior part of the body being much broader than the rest. The bronzed adults are usually seen only where suitable material occurs in sunny locations.|$|E
50|$|In 1790, ice {{yachting}} was {{in vogue}} on the Hudson River, its headquarters being at Poughkeepsie, New York. The type was a square box on three runners, the two forward, ones being {{nailed to the}} box and the third acting as a rudder operated by a tiller. The sail was a <b>flatheaded</b> sprit. This primitive style was in general use until 1853, when triangular frames with boxes for the crew aft and jib and mainsail rig were introduced. A heavy, hard-riding type soon developed, with short gaffs, low sails, large jibs and booms extending far over the stern. It was over-canvassed and the mast was stepped directly over the runner plank, bringing the centre of sail-balance so far aft that the boats were apt to run away, and the over-canvassing frequently caused the windward runner to swing {{up into the air}} to a dangerous height. The largest and fastest example of this type, which prevailed until 1879, was Commodore J. A. Roosevelt's first Icicle, which measured 69 ft overall and carried 1070 sq ft of canvas. In 1879, H. Relyea built the Robert Scott, which had a single backbone and guy wires, and it became the model for all Hudson River ice yachts. Masts were now stepped farther forward, jibs were shortened, booms were cut down, and the center of sail-balance was brought more inboard and higher up, causing the centers of effort and resistance to come more in harmony. The shallow steering-box became elliptical. In 1881 occurred the first race for the American Challenge Pennant, which represents the championship of the Hudson River; the clubs that competed included the Hudson River, North Shrewsbury, Orange Lake, Newburgh and Carthage Ice Yacht Clubs. The races are usually sailed five times round a triangle of which each leg measures one mile, {{at least two of the}} legs being to windward. Ice yachts are divided into four classes, carrying respectively 600 sq ft of canvas or more, between 450 and 600, between 300 and 450, and less than 300 sq ft. Ice yachting is very popular on the Great Lakes, both in the United States and Canada, the Kingston, Ontario Club having a fleet of over 25 sail. Other important centers of the sport are the Lake Geneva, Wisconsin area, with an average of twenty-five sailing days a season for the last five years, Lakes Minnetonka and White Bear in Minnesota, Lakes Winnebago and Pepin in Wisconsin, Bar Harbor Lake in Maine, the St. Lawrence River, Quinte Bay and Lake Champlain.|$|E
40|$|NYS IPM Type: Fruits IPM Fact SheetAlthough {{the number}} of wood-boring beetles attacking fruit trees is {{relatively}} small and their infestations are sporadic, four species found in New York are capable of seriously damaging or killing trees. They differ some in biology and life history, but they are addressed here as a group because their general activities as a pest class are similar. Taken in order of importance and frequency as a pest, they are the roundheaded appletree borer, <b>flatheaded</b> appletree borer, broad necked root borer, and tilehorned prionus. With {{the exception of the}} flattheaded appletree borer, which is a buprestid (metallic woodboring beetle), they belong to the cerambycid (long-horned beetle) family, and the last two are closely related species in the group known as prionus root borers. All are native to and widely distributed throughout the United States and southern Canada. They all damage deciduous fruit and shade trees by tunneling as larvae in to the conducting tissue of the lower trunk, crown, and roots and compounding the injury by providing an entryway for destructive fungi. Each of these pests attacks a broad range of host plants. All four species attack apple, cherry, peach, and plum, and the roundheaded and <b>flatheaded</b> borers also occur in quince, pear, flowering crabapple, mountain ash, shadbush, cotoneaster, and hawthorn. The <b>flatheaded</b> borer and {{one or both of the}} two Prionus species are also serious pests of numerous other trees, including pecan, hickory, poplar, willow, chestnut, oak, maple, dogwood, linden, and several shrubs...|$|E

40|$|For {{the first}} time an ichneumonoid {{parasitoid}} is reported from the peach <b>flatheaded</b> rootborer Capnodis tenebrionis (Linnaeus, 1758) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) in a heavily infested plum and apricot orchard in south-western Sicily. In 2005 and 2006 {{the ecology of the}} ectoparasitoid Spathius erythrocephalus Wesmael, 1838, (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was studied. The larvae are ectophagous and gregarious; obviously the parasitoid search for the large buprestid larval (6. 0 ± 0. 4 cm). The adult parasitoid appeared in both cultivations in August and/or September and selected only the mature larvae for oviposition. In 2006 35 % of the rootborer larvae on plum were parasitized. Significant diff erences were found between the mean depth in the soil in which parasitized and non-parasitized larvae were found, although C. tenebrionis larvae closest {{to the level of the}} soil surface are the easier to reach. The parasitoid is able to search for and parasitize host larvae up to a soil depth of 20 cm. No significant diff erence was found in the distribution of the parasitoid with respect to the compass orientation within the tree. Spathius erythrocephalus is a new promising antagonist for the biological control of the noxious peach <b>flatheaded</b> rootborer...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine various host and microclimatic {{influences}} affecting the survival and development of the <b>flatheaded</b> fir borer, Melanophila drummondi (Kirby) in Douglas fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco residues. It also expands current knowledge of the biology, bionomics, life history, ecology, and biotic potential for decomposition of forest residues by this insect. The primary study objective was to determine the optimum host and microclimatic conditions for development of the <b>flatheaded</b> fir borer by measuring the rate of beetle development with an index employed in other studies on forest insects. The monthly rates of development of larvae from clearcut and partial cut (shelterwood system) logs and from 15. 6 °, 21. 1 °, and 26. 7 °C controlled-temperature rearings were determined over the development season. Inner phloem moisture content and pH were monitored monthly from four quadrants (south-top, south-bottom, north-bottom, and north-top) on logs from each treatment throughout the season. Measurements of ambient air temperature and precipitation for the two field sites were used to correlate the microclimate of the host to these physical factors of weather. In addition, various other studies examined the relationship between inner phloem temperature and ambient air temperature on cloudy and clear days and also between logs of different bark thicknesses, and at the top and bottom of a log. Forest residues are attacked immediately after they become available from timber cutting or tree mortality in the spring and summer. Tops down to 7. 62 cm in diameter are utilized by this beetle, although thinner bark of small diameter residues afford less protection from temperature extremes, parasites and avian predators than thick-barked residues. Eggs are typically deposited on the tops or upper sides of logs and residues by woodborers, and they also prefer clearcuts over partial cuts. Furthermore, larval densities are higher on the tops and sides of residues and on clearcuts, compared to other locations. The top portion and upper sides of residues are characterized by warmer inner phloem temperatures, lower moisture contents, and less acidity than the bottom half of logs and residues on the ground. In addition, clearcut logs are generally characterized by these qualities. Temperature and moisture differences around the logs are believed to affect the distribution of the <b>flatheaded</b> woodborers within logs. Although the <b>flatheaded</b> fir borer invades residues on both clearcuts and partial cuts, the clearcuts are preferred because of warmer temperatures. The rate of development is also greatest on clearcuts, and maturity to adult is reached sooner due to faster accumulation of heat units on these sites. The clearcut represents optimal conditions for development and survival of this insect. Larvae reared at three different constant temperatures in the laboratory failed to develop past the 3 rd instar (pre-pupa), presumably because of the lack of a cold period which is required to break diapause in this resting stage. Parasitism accounts for the greatest proportion of woodborer mortality. Other mortality factors include resinoisis, predation, and unknown causes. Various parasites were reared and identified as mortality factors, but Atanycolus longifemoralis Shenefelt was most frequently observed. Other parasites and predators are discussed in their role as natural enemies of the <b>flatheaded</b> fir borer. An accurate and precise linear regression method is described which enables the estimation of inner phloem surface area of larval galleries from measurements of the gallery length. Its use in estimating woodborer-caused deterioration in forest residue surveys is emphasized...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem is}} {{concerned}} with the infestation of coniferous logs by barkbeetles and wood-boring insects during the first season following the felling of the tree. The meristem and wood insects concerned in this study were all members of the order Coleoptera, families Cerambycidae (roundheaded borers), Buprestidae (<b>flatheaded</b> borers), Scolytidae(barkbeetles and ambrosia beetles), and Curculionidae (weevils). The coniferous logs under consideration were cut from tree species of pine, spruce, balsam, and hemlock, all found in Eastern Canada. The present study considers the attractiveness of such logs to oviposition by the barkbeetles and woodborers as influenced by a number of factors enumerated below. Furthermore it investigates the effect of some of these factors upon the subsequent development of these insects after establishment. Of necessity, such a field experiment can only indicate a number of trends but since most of the operating factors cannot be considered independently with any accuracy, the writer believes that an extensive rather than an intensive survey is all that is justified at present.

40|$|Background: The {{flat-headed cat}} (Prionailurus planiceps) {{is one of}} the world’s least known, highly {{threatened}} felids with a distribution restricted to tropical lowland rainforests in Peninsular Thailand/Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra. Throughout its geographic range large-scale anthropogenic transformation processes, including the pollution of fresh-water river systems and landscape fragmentation, raise concerns regarding its conservation status. Despite an increasing number of cameratrapping field surveys for carnivores in South-East Asia during the past two decades, few of these studies recorded the <b>flatheaded</b> cat. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we designed a predictive species distribution model using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm to reassess the potential current distribution and conservation status of the flat-headed cat. Eighty-eight independent species occurrence records were gathered from field surveys, literature records, and museum collections. These current and historical records were analysed in relation to bioclimatic variables (WorldClim), altitude (SRTM) and minimum distance to larger water resources (Digital Chart of the World).

Distance to water was identified as the key predictor for the occurrence of flat-headed cats (. 50 % explanation). In addition, we used different land cover maps (GLC 2000, GlobCover and SarVision LLC for Borneo), information on protected areas and regional human population density data to extract suitable habitats from the potential distribution predicted by the MaxEnt model. Between 54 % and 68 % of suitable habitat has already been converted to unsuitable land cover types (e. g. croplands, plantations), and only between 10 % and 20 % of suitable land cover is categorised as fully protected according to the IUCN criteria. The remaining habitats are highly fragmented and only a few larger forest patches remain. Conclusion/Significance: Based on our findings, we recommend that future conservation efforts for the flat-headed cat should focus on the identified remaining key localities and be implemented through a continuous dialogue between local stakeholders, conservationists and scientists to ensure its long-term survival. The flat-headed cat can serve as a flagship species for the protection of several other endangered species associated with the threatened tropical lowland forests and surface fresh-water sources in this region...|$|E
