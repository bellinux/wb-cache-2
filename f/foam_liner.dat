Objective To investigate the effects of 3 dissimilar suspension systems on participants' satisfaction and perceived problems with their prostheses. Design Questionnaire survey. Setting A medical and engineering research center and a university biomedical engineering department. Participants Persons with unilateral transtibial amputation (N= 243), using prostheses with polyethylene <b>foam</b> <b>liner,</b> silicone liner with shuttle lock, and seal-in liner.

Results The results showed {{significant differences between the}} 3 groups regarding the degree of satisfaction and perceived problems with the prosthetic device. Analyses of the individual items revealed that the study participants were more satisfied with the seal-in liner and experienced fewer problems with this liner.

40|$|The energy {{absorbing}} liner of safety helmets was optimised using finite element modelling. In this present paper, a functionally graded foam (FGF) liner was modelled, {{while keeping the}} average liner density {{the same as in}} a corresponding reference single uniform density liner model. Use of a functionally graded <b>foam</b> <b>liner</b> would eliminate issues regarding delamination and crack propagation between interfaces of different density layers which could arise in liners with discrete density variations. As in our companion Part I paper [Forero Rueda MA, Cui L, Gilchrist MD. Optimisation of {{energy absorbing}} liner for equestrian helmets.

Similar results were found and these compare favourably against the energy absorption of uniform density foam liners. Reduction in peak accelerations is dependant of contact area, the distribution of stress along the thickness of the liner, and the dissipated plastic energy density (DPED). This suggests that {{it should be possible to}} use FGF liners instead of discrete foam layers to reduce peak linear acceleration and thereby to maximise the energy absorbing efficiency of the available space within a helmet...|$|E

This offered acceptable protection from scrapes and cuts, but only minimal impact protection, and was mainly used by racing cyclists. More widespread use of helmets began in the U.S. in the 1970s. After many decades, when bicycles were regarded only as children's toys, many American adults took up cycling during and after the bike boom of the 1970s.

40|$|Syntactic foams-composite {{materials}} {{consisting of}} hollow particles {{embedded in a}} host matrix-have many applications for manufactured products, including weight reduction, thermal insulation, and noise reduction. In this thesis, a certain variety of syntactic foam is investigated with regards to reducing fluid borne noise in hydraulic systems. Such a foam maintains stiffness at low hydrostatic pressures and becomes compressible as pressure increases. With this compressibility, the foam is potentially useful as a liner for a reactive noise control device, much like compressed gas style devices currently in use; but the syntactic foam additionally adds significant damping to the system. In order to predict device performance, a linear multimodal model is developed of a hydraulic suppressor, constructed as an expansion chamber lined with a syntactic foam insert. Material models are developed for various compositions of the <b>foam</b> <b>liners,</b> based on an inverse analysis matching the model to experimental results. Two model simplifications are considered, and {{it is found that}} a simplified bulk modulus model gives sufficiently accurate results to make approximate predictions of suppressor performance. Several optimizations are performed to predict the optimal material composition for hydraulic excavator work cycles. To help compare the prototype suppressor against commercially available bladder style suppressors, a model is developed for the bladder style silencer and is validated experimentally. Overall, this work both demonstrates the current and potential utility of syntactic foam as a device lining material, and contributes new models to the hydraulics noise control community. Ph.

The diffusors function to center the liner within the device, while reducing the potential for turbulence-induced self-noise.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Traumatic brain {{injuries}} (TBI) caused by shock waves have attracted increased attention {{due to the}} large percentage of combat troops that have sustained such injuries in recent wars. Use of advanced body armor has decreased the number of fatalities due to ballistic impacts after explosions, increasing the percentage of observed non-fatal {{brain injuries}} from blast waves. A new design concept for a combat helmet liner is proposed that introduces solid and fluid filler materials inside channels in the <b>foam</b> <b>liner</b> to improve the attenuation of incoming shock waves. Mechanisms include acoustic impedance mismatches at the filler/foam material interface, viscous energy dissipation via fluid filler motion, and multiple reflection interfaces in granular filler materials. Both shock tube experiments and numerical studies using ABAQUS ® are carried out. Intricacies of the numerical model developed in ABAQUS ® to model the shock response of structures are discussed. Preliminary results show that use of high density filler materials results in higher levels of blast attenuation than those observed with low density materials, when compared to solid foam control samples.

40|$|A key {{component}} of a safety helmet is the <b>foam</b> <b>liner,</b> which absorbs the greatest portion of impact energy during an accident. The aim {{of the present study}} is twofold: to design a motorcycle helmet equipped with an innovative liner optimized with regard to energy absorption and to do so by coupling engineering expertise with design of experiments and response surface modelling. The new liner consists of an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic lamina shaped into deformable cones. Energy is absorbed via a combination of folding and collapsing of the cones. The main advantage that such a liner may introduce over common expanded polystyrene pads are that it allows a better optimization of energy absorption for different impact sites and configurations. Design of experiments was used to identify the most relevant parameters in the definition of the mechanical behaviour of the cones. Design of experiments and response surface modelling were then used to design a helmet with optimized performance. Finally, the performance of the newly designed helmet was compared with that of its existing commercial counterpart.

40|$|Two {{innovative}} fan-noise reduction concepts {{developed by}} NASA are presented - soft vanes and over-the-rotor metal foam liners. Design methodologies are described for each concept. Soft vanes are outlet guide vanes with internal, resonant chambers that {{communicate with the}} exterior aeroacoustic environment via a porous surface. They provide acoustic absorption via viscous losses generated by interaction of unsteady flows with the internal solid structure. Over-the-rotor metal foam liners installed {{at or near the}} fan rotor axial plane provide rotor noise absorption. Both concepts also provide pressure-release surfaces that potentially inhibit noise generation. Several configurations for both concepts are evaluated with a normal incidence tube, and the results are used to guide designs for implementation in two NASA fan rigs. For soft vanes, approximately 1 to 2 dB of broadband inlet and aft-radiated fan noise reduction is achieved.

The importance of seating Good seating contributes significantly to enjoyment and functional daily living for both the disabled and the able bodied. Most people spend several hours each day sitting, whether for eating meals, watching television or as part of their jobs. For the disabled the period may begin as soon as they are dressed in the morning and continue late into the evening, a period of perhaps 12 - 16 hours.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringFoam {{cementing}} {{the reservoir}} liner {{has proven to}} be a good solution for achieving zonal isolation due to its low permeability and high compressive strength. However, out of the 32 reservoir liners cemented on the Ekofisk M platform only 16 were defined as 100 % successful. In this thesis <b>foam</b> cement and <b>liner</b> string components are introduced before evaluating the outcome of the different jobs. A success criterion for the outcome is established, incorporating liner centralization, zonal isolation and liner movement. The criterion regards the outcome a success if liner manipulation is maintained throughout the job and no remedial job is needed, a semi-success if manipulation is maintained for most of the job and no remedial job is needed, and a failure if none of the previously mentioned. Data from all the reservoir liner cementing operations are gathered and the outcome of each is evaluated based on the above criterion. 16 of the liners were cemented successfully, 6 were semi-successfully, and the last 10 were failures. Failing to reestablish rotation after setting the liner hanger is the most common reason for failure, 7 out of 10 failures can be related to this. Wellbore inclination and liner length are both parameters which seems to contribute to the outcome of foam cementing the reservoir liner. 13 of the 32 wells have an inclination above 80 º at the liner shoe. Out of these 13 wells only 4 are regarded as successful, the rest are either semi-successful, 4, or failures, 5. Even though failures are observed for all inclinations, this happens more frequently at higher inclination. The success rate also seems to be influenced be the length of the liner. For shorter liners, i. e. with a length below 2000 ft, nearly 78 % of the cement jobs were successful, whereas the same percentage for liners with a length between 5000 ft and 6000 ft is 25 %. In fact, a near linear trend is observed for the success rate as the length increases...|$|R

Surface-designed Microbial Ponds have the capability to perform all of the functions for a successful Nitrogen Cycle without the use of a filter. Our verification test pond has enough surface area alone to maintain negligible nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia levels with the filter turned off for days. Although, filtration is usually required for fugitive particulate, and waste removal.
