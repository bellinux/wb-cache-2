50|$|TLR9 {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major player in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Loss of TLR9 exacerbates progression of SLE, and leads to increased activation of <b>dentritic</b> <b>cells.</b> TLR9 also controls the release of IgA and IFN-a in SLE, and loss the receptor leads to higher levels of both cytokines. In SLE, TLR9 and TLR7 have opposing effects. TLR9 regulates inflammatory response, while TLR7 promotes inflammatory response. TLR9 has an opposite effect in ENL. TLR9 is expressed at high levels on monocytes of ENL patients, and is positively linked to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β. TLR9 agonists and antagonists may be useful in treatment of a variety of inflammatory conditions, and research in this area is active. Autoimmune thyroid diseases have also been shown to correlate with an increase in expression of TLR9 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs). Patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases also have higher levels of the nuclear protein HMGB1 and RAGE protein, which together act as a ligand for TLR9. HMB1 is released from lysed or damaged cells. HMGB1-DNA complex then binds to RAGE, and activates TLR9. TLR9 can work through MyD88, an adaptor molecule that increases the expression of NF-kB. However autoimmune thyroid diseases also increase sensitivity of MyD88 independent pathways. These pathway ultimately leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in PMBCs for patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases. Autoimmune diseases can also be triggered by activated cells undergoing apoptosis and being engulfed by antigen presenting cells. Activation of cells leads to de-methylation, which exposes CpG regions of host DNA, allowing an inflammatory response to be activated through TLR9. Although it is possible that TLR9 also recognizes unmethylated DNA, TLR9 undoubtedly has a role in phagocytosis-induced autoimmunity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract It is {{important}} to understand the neural dendrite formation at molecular level. Unfortunately, the regulation mechanisms underlying neural dendrite formation remain unclear. In our previous work, it is found that <b>dentritic</b> <b>cell</b> factors (DCF 1) express differentially between undifferentiated and differentiated neural stem cells (NSCs). In this study, we compared whole-genome gene expression data for DCF 1 -knockout and wild type mice. By integrating gene expression data and protein-protein interaction data, a connected subnetwork that consist of differentially expressed genes is identified. Analyzing the affected subnetwork, we find that glycolysis is enriched for downregulated genes in the extracted subnetwork while biosynthetic process is enriched for up-regulated genes, which give hints that DCF 1 is possibly related to these functions and provides guidelines for future experiment verification...|$|R

However, the cellular subset {{responsible for the}} prevention of autoimmunity in FasL-deficient mice remains undetermined. Here, we show that mice with FasL loss on either B or T cells had identical life span as littermates, and both genotypes developed signs of autoimmunity. In addition, we show that T cell-dependent death was vital for the elimination of aberrant T cells and for controlling the numbers of B cells and dendritic cells that dampen autoimmune responses. Furthermore, we show that the loss of FasL on T cells affected the follicular <b>dentritic</b> <b>cell</b> network in the germinal centers, leading to an impaired recall response to exogenous antigen. These results disclose the distinct roles of cellular subsets in FasL-dependent control of autoimmunity and provide further insight into the role of FasL in humoral immunity...|$|R

However, {{the formulation of}} SLPs for in vivo administration {{still needs to be}} improved. So far, SLPs have been formulated in Montanide-based water-in-oil emulsions in (pre-) clinical trials. However, the use of Montanide as an adjuvant has some important limitations, such as: non-biodegradability; significant local side effects; poor control of release rate; lack of specific <b>dentritic</b> <b>cell</b> (DC) -activating capacity; and the presence of organic solvents (needed to dissolve the peptides prior to mixing with the adjuvant) in the final formulation.

METHODS: Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). CLP-induced sepsis was treated with anti-C 5 a or IL- 12. IL- 12 (+) DC, IFNγ(+) Th 1, and IL- 17 (+) Th 17 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. IL- 12 was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Our studies here showed that C 5 a induced IL- 12 (+) DC cell migration from the peritoneal cavity to peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Furthermore, IL- 12 (+) DC cells induced the expansion of pathogenic IFNγ(+) Th 1 and IL- 17 (+) Th 17 cells in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Moreover, IL- 12, secreted by DC cells in the peritoneal cavity, is an important factor that prevents the development of sepsis.

The purpose was to further explore the effect of FAST deficiency in innate immune system, particularly in some macrophage functions such as phagocytosis and intracellular killing of gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Compared with wild-type macrophages, FAST-/- macrophages exhibited increased phagocytosis of Escherichia coli both in vitro and in vivo. Evaluation of the expression of the receptors TLR 2 and TLR 4 and maturation markers revealed no significant differences between wild-type and FAST-/-macrophages. Both cell types also showed a similar ability to kill bacteria and to produce reactive oxygen species. Bacterial counts at the early time points in the gentamicin protection assay correlated well with the phagocytic indexes. Consistent with the findings in FAST-/-macrophages, human THP- 1 macrophages with silenced FAST expression showed increased phagocytosis of Escherichia coli compared with control cells.

This study aimed to investigate how collagen type II and NP cells affect adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) in a 3 D environment. ASCs were cultured in collagen type I or type II hydrogels alone, or co-cultured in transwells with micromass NP cells for 4 and 14 days. ASCs seeded in collagen type II gels acquired <b>dentritic</b> <b>cell</b> shapes, and orchestrated cell density-dependent gel contraction rates. Up-regulation of collagen type X, but not of other chondrogenic markers was observed at day 4, irrespective of the hydrogel type. Strikingly, in co-cultures with NP cells, more pronounced differentiation of ASCs along the cartilaginous lineage was observed (up-regulation of collagen IIA, IIB and aggrecan gene expression, as well as stronger alcian blue staining), when ASCs were embedded in collagen type II in comparison with type I hydrogels. Interestingly, strong cellular condensations/aggregations were observed in ASC-seeded type II, but not type I gels, and this aggregation was markedly delayed when the same gels were co-cultured with NP cells. The NP cell-mediated inhibition of ASC aggregation in collagen type II gels coincided with down-regulation of integrin subunit α 2 gene expression. We conclude that soluble factors released by NP cells can direct chondrogenic differentiation of ASCs in collagen hydrogels, and that combination with a nucleus-mimicking collagen type II microenvironment enhances differentiation towards a more pronounced cartilage/NP lineage relative to collagen type I hydrogels. © 2008 The Authors...|$|R

Methods　Clinical data of 27 mRCC patients treated with sunitinib combined with autologous DC and CIK were reviewed retrospectively. Efficacy, quality of life, immunology and safety of this treatment were evaluated. Results　Follow-up time ranged from 4 to 25 months. Out of all the patients, sunitinib was reduced in 1 and discontinued in 2 due to side effects; 1 patient quit for personal reasons; 14 patients developed progressive disease. The progression-free survival (PFS) was 4 to 19. 5 months. Ten patients died from tumor, the overall survival time (OS) was 6 to 21 months. The median PFS was 16 months (95 %CI 12. 5 - 19. 5). The OS was not achieved. The efficacy was evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). All the patients received treatment over 1 cycle. After one course of treatment, among 27 patients, 0 had complete remission (CR), 4 had partial remission (PR), 17 had stable disease (SD), and 6 had progressive disease (PD). The overall objective remission rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 14. 8 % (4 / 27) and 77. 8 % (21 / 27), respectively. Sunitinib and autologous transfusion of DC and CIK improved the immune function and quality of life. The major adverse events were fatigue, hand-foot syndrome, hypertension, hypothyroidism, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and fever. Most of the adverse events were ameliorated by supportive treatment or dose reduction. Conclusions　 Sunitinib combined with autologous DC and CIK may be beneficial {{in the treatment of}} mRCC with acceptable toxic reactions, and it may be considered as a new approach for the comprehensive treatment of RCC.

Vaccination with Hsp 70 -peptide complexes (Hsp 70 -PCs), isolated from autologous tumour cells, can induce protective immune responses. We have developed a novel method to identify synthetic mimic peptides of Hsp 70 -PCs and to test their ability to activate T-cells. Peptides (referred to as "recognisers") that bind to Hsp 70 -PCs from the human breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB- 231, were identified by bio-panning a random peptide M 13 phage display library. Synthetic recogniser peptides were subsequently used as bait in a reverse bio-panning experiment to identify potential Hsp 70 -Pc mimic peptides. The ability of the recogniser and mimic peptides to prime human lymphocyte responses against tumour cell antigens was tested by simulating lymphocytes with autologous peptide-loaded monocyte-derived <b>dentritic</b> <b>cells</b> (DCs).

In high transmission areas, children acquire schistosome infection early in life with infection levels peaking in early childhood and subsequently declining in late childhood. This age-related infection profile is thought to result from the gradual development of protective acquired immunity. Age-related differences in schistosome-specific humoral and cellular responses have been reported from several field studies. However there has not yet been a systematic study of the age-related changes in human dendritic cells, the drivers of T cell polarisation.

40|$|The {{sympathetic}} {{nervous system}} has {{a major role in}} the brain-immune cross-talk, but few information exist on the sympathoadrenergic regulation of innate immune system. The aim of this review is to summarize available knowledge regarding the sympathetic modulation of the innate immune response, providing a rational background for the possible repurposing of adrenergic drugs as immunomodulating agents. The cells of immune system express adrenoceptors (AR), which represent the target for noradrenaline and adrenaline. In human neutrophils, adrenaline and noradrenaline inhibit migration, CD 11 b/CD 18 expression, and oxidative metabolism, possibly through β-AR, although the role of α 1 - and α 2 -AR requires further investigation. Natural Killer express β-AR, which are usually inhibitory. Monocytes express β-AR and their activation is usually antiinflammatory. On murine <b>Dentritic</b> <b>cells</b> (DC), β-AR mediate sympathetic influence on DC-T cells interactions. In human DC β 2 -AR may affect Th 1 / 2 differentiation of CD 4 + T cells. In microglia and in astrocytes, β 2 -AR dysregulation may contribute to neuroinflammation in autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease. In conclusion, extensive evidence supports a critical role for adrenergic mechanisms in the regulation of innate immunity, in peripheral tissues as well as in the CNS.

EST clones corresponding to hgpr84 were from B cells (leukemia), neuroendocrine lung as well as in microglial cells and adipocytes. A more detailed description of expression profile can be found in www.genecards.org. The resting expression of GPR84 is usually low but it is highly inducible in inflammation. Its expression on neutrophils can be increased with LPS stimulation and reduced with GM-CSF stimulation. The LPS-induced upregulation of GPR84 was not sensitive to dexamathasone pretreatment. There was also a GPR84 downregulation in <b>dentritic</b> <b>cell</b> derived from FcRgamma chain KO mice. In microglial cells, the GPR84 induction with interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) was also demonstrated. 24 h treatment with IL-1β also induced 5.8 times increase in GPR84 expression on PBMC from healthy individuals[...] Transcriptional dynamics of human umbilical cord blood T helper cells cultured in absence and presence of cytokines promoting Th1 or Th2 differentiation was studies. It turned out that GPR84 belongs to the Th1 specific subset genes. While another publication suggests that GPR84 is rather a CCL1 related Th2 type gene.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{selection}} of relevant genes for sample classification {{is a common}} task in many gene expression studies. Although a number of tools {{have been developed to}} identify optimal gene expression signatures, they often generate gene lists that are too long to be exploited clinically. Consequently, researchers in the field try to identify the smallest set of genes that provide good sample classification. We investigated the genome-wide expression of the inflammatory phenotype in dendritic cells. Dendritic cells are a complex group of cells that {{play a critical role in}} vertebrate immunity. Therefore, the prediction of the inflammatory phenotype in these cells may help with the {{selection of}} immune-modulating compounds. Results A data mining protocol was applied to microarray data for murine cell lines treated with various inflammatory stimuli. The learning and validation data sets consisted of 155 and 49 samples, respectively. The data mining protocol reduced the number of probe sets from 5, 802 to 10, then from 10 to 6 and finally from 6 to 3. The performances of a set of supervised classification models were compared. The best accuracy, when using the six following genes [...] Il 12 b, Cd 40, Socs 3, Irgm 1, Plin 2 and Lgals 3 bp [...] was obtained by Tree Augmented Naïve Bayes and Nearest Neighbour (91. 8 %). Using the smallest set of three genes [...] Il 12 b, Cd 40 and Socs 3 [...] the performance remained satisfactory and the best accuracy was with Support Vector Machine (95. 9 %). These data mining models, using data for the genes Il 12 b, Cd 40 and Socs 3, were validated with a human data set consisting of 27 samples. Support Vector Machines (71. 4 %) and Nearest Neighbour (92. 6 %) gave the worst performances, but the remaining models correctly classified all the 27 samples. Conclusions The genes selected by the data mining protocol proposed were shown to be informative for discriminating between inflammatory and steady-state phenotypes in dendritic cells. The robustness of the data mining protocol was confirmed by the accuracy for a human data set, when using only the following three genes: Il 12 b, Cd 40 and Socs 3. In summary, we analysed the longitudinal pattern of expression in dendritic cells stimulated with activating agents with the aim of identifying signatures that would predict or explain the <b>dentritic</b> <b>cell</b> response to an inflammatory agent. </p...|$|R
40|$|Because the spleen {{is likely}} to play a {{specific}} role in immunity, {{we have tried to}} observe the influence of the abdominal neoplasms on splenic lymphoid tissue as well as the distribution and localization of immunoregulatory cells with a special attention to the marginal zone, using splenectomy specimens in the various kinds of 121 abdominal neoplasm patients. As a control group, twenty-six splenectomy specimens from patients with traumatic rupture were used. In splenic size and weight, there was a statistically meaningful increase in the patients with abdominal neoplasms. Among those patients, the evolving activated immune reaction (EVA) was 60. 2 %, the early activated immune-reaction (EAA) 39. 0 %, the mixed evolving activated and granulomatous reaction (MIX) 0. 8 %, unlike EVA 30. 8 %, EAA 69. 2 %, and MIX 0 % in the normal control group. The reason for this change may be explained by activated lymphoid tissue in the form of EVA type. In conclusion, the splenic lymphoid tissue in the various kinds of abdominal neoplasms, mostly malignant, revealed the chronic immune activated state characterized by the increased number of prominent germinal centers and distinct marginal zones, the latter of which revealed the positive reaction for L 26, IgM and IgG, and negative for IgD, as well as showing increased natural killer and <b>dentritic</b> reticulum <b>cells</b> identified by Leu 7 and S- 100 protein respectively. Therefore, we could at least find the significance of the immunologic role of the spleen in the case of abdominal neoplasms, mostly from malignancy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dentritic</b> <b>cells</b> (DC) as antigen-presenting {{cells are}} most likely {{responsible}} for regulation of abnormal T cell activation in Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. We have analyzed the expression of activation and maturation markers on DC in the colon mucosa from patients with CD compared with normal colon, using immunohistochemical techniques. We found two distinct populations of DC present in CD patients: a DC-specific ICAM- 3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) (+) population that was present scattered throughout the mucosa, and a CD 83 (+) population that was present in aggregated lymphoid nodules and as single cells in the lamina propria. In normal colon the number of DC-SIGN(+) DC was lower and CD 83 (+) DC were detected only in very few solitary lymphoid nodules. Co-expression of activation markers and cytokine synthesis was analyzed with three-color confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis. CD 80 expression was enhanced on the majority of DC-SIGN(+) DC in CID patients, whereas only a proportion of the CD 83 (+) DC co-expressed CD 80 in CID {{as well as in}} normal tissue. Surprisingly, IL- 12 and IL- 18 were only detected in DC-SIGN(+) DC and not in CD 83 (+) DC. A similar pattern of cytokine production was observed in normal colon albeit to a much lesser extent. The characteristics of these in-situ-differentiated DC markedly differ from the in-vitro-generated DC that simultaneously express DC-SIGN, CD 83 and cytokine...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{analysis of}} human thymic <b>dentritic</b> <b>cells</b> (DC) in culture and in purified suspensions {{has been studied}} with light and electron microscopic (EM) immunolabelling techniques. Using a series of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and a protein A-gold technique, we demonstrated that DR- and T 6 -positive cultured DC strongly bind the 9. 3 F 10 mAb, an anti-DR-related antibody produced against human blood DC, and weakly express the T 4 antigen, a membrane marker shared by Langerhan's cells (LC). On the other hand, thymic-cultured DC are negative for the other T-cell and monocyte-macrophage antigens. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} human thymic DC may be related to blood DC and epidermal LC. Moreover DC, unlike thymic macrophages, do not phagocytose latex particles, opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC) or Candida albicans. An efficient two-step technique of isolation, using a Percoll density gradient followed by an indirect panning technique, yields a purified (70 - 80 %) thymic DC population, OKIa 1 -, 9. 3 F 10 - and OKT 6 -positive and esterase-negative. Immunolabelling and electron microscopy confirm that these isolated DC present similar phenotypic and ultrastructural features to human thymic DC in situ and in culture. Purified DC, used as stimulator cells in mixed leucocyte reaction (MLR), induce stronger proliferative responses than peripheral blood monocytes used as a control; blocking assays with OKIa 1 mAb plus complement greatly reduced this stimulatory potency. These functional assays demonstrate that we obtained a purified typical DC population {{that can be used in}} immunological functional studies to elucidate the specific role of DC in human thymus...|$|E
40|$|Eicosanoids {{constitute}} {{a large and}} expanding family of bioactive lipids synthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to either pro-inflammatory omega- 6 arachidonic acid (AA) or anti-inflammatory omega- 3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In these last cases, two essential fatty acids (FAs) (ω- 6 linoleic acid (C 18 : 2 n 6) and ω- 3 linolenic acid (LA) (C 18 : 3 n 3) are utilized as substrates {{and a series of}} desaturase and elongase enzymes are essential for their production. Among these different members, the AA-derived eicosanoids operate as potent signaling mediators that provide an efficient way for cells to respond to various stimuli. As a result, they act as part of a complex regulatory network and control a number of important physiological processes. Some of these processes include: • smooth muscle tone • vascular permeability • platelet aggregation • broncho-constriction/dilation • intestine motility • inhibition of gastric acid secretion • uterus contraction • kidney filtration renal blood flow • an increase in hypothalamic • pituitary hormone secretion. Their action is mediated through the binding to specific G-protein-coupled membrane receptors. These receptors can trigger a fluctuation in the rate of cytosolic second messenger generation (cAMP or Ca 2 +), activation of specific protein kinases or changes in membrane potential. Different cellular types are involved in their production from classical inflammatory cells, such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes, macrophages (important producers) and mast cells, to <b>dentritic</b> <b>cells</b> which represent both a source and target of AA-derived eicosanoids. In addition, human activated T and B cells produce significant amounts of eicosanoids, particularly prostaglandins such as PGD 2 and PGE 2. This propriety might be principally central to several functions of B cells. However, AA-derived eicosanoids also constitute the optimal amount of immune/inflammatory responses by mediating their effects on macrophages, mast cells, <b>dentritic</b> <b>cells,</b> lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Thus, they are also able to exert both the evocation of immune responses and immune-modulation. In addition to their capacity to elicit biological responses, eicosanoids (in particular AA-derived eicosanoids) are now understood to regulate immunopathological processes ranging from inflammatory responses to chronic tissue remodeling, obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Allergic diseases, cardiovascular complications (i. e. coronaropathies, aneurysm, etc), cancer, rheumatoid and autoimmune disorders are additional bodily functions affected as well. A genetic basis has been postulated for susceptibility to each of these diseases. Each of these medical conditions are syndromic and caused by more than one molecular defect. On the other hand, they are multifactorial diseases. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} genetic variants in eicosanoid pathways have a role in the risk of these diseases. Their combinations have been observed in patients affected by these maladies. Thus, they might be used as promising biomarkers in a pre- and post-treatment clinical setting. Indeed, their identifications may hold promise for the realization of a personalized medicine. The evidence is growing in terms of the eicisaoid role in tissue regeneration and wound healing. It is also interesting how a Mediterranean diet might be suggested as an advantageous and new form of anti-inflammatory therapy. This implies the possibility of using eicosanoids as both health and disease biomarkers and to consider them as potential therapeutic targets. Many of these aspects are summarized in this book. The data described is based on expert opinion derived from the findings of studies on aging, age-related diseases and inflammation. (Imprint: Nova Biomedical...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Exosomes, {{a type of}} {{membrane}} vesicles, {{released from}} tumor cells {{have been shown to}} be capable of transferring tumor antigens to dendritic cells and activating specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Recent work has demonstrated the presence of high numbers of exosomes in malignant effusions. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a rich source of hematopoietic stem cells and from which a significant number of dendritic cells can be produced. We hypothesized that the exosomes released from metastatic ovarian carcinoma were able to present tumor specific antigen to dendritic cells derived from unrelated umbilical cord blood, then could stimulate resting T cells to differentiate and induce effective cytotoxicity. Study design: Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation of malignant ascites from ovarian cancer patients (n = 10). Purified exosomes were further characterized by Western blot analyses and immunoelectronic microscopy. Dendritic cells were collected from unrelated umbilical cord blood and cultured in the presence of GM-CSF, IL- 4 and TNF-α. Resting T cells were mixed with <b>dentritic</b> <b>cells</b> previously primed with exosomes and the cytotoxicity were measured by MTT method. T cells were activated by DCs presented with exosomes. Results: 1) the exosomes isolated from the ascites were membrane vesicles of about 30 – 90 nm in diameter; 2) the exosomes expressed MHC class I molecules, HSP 70, HSP 90, Her 2 /Neu, and Mart 1; and 3) umbilical cord blood-derived DCs previously exosome-primed stimulated resting T cells to differentiate and produce effective cytotoxicity. Conclusions: These results suggested that tumor-specific antigens present on exosomes can be presented by DCs derived from unrelated umbilical cord blood to induce tumor specific cytotoxicity and this may represent as a novel immunotherapy for ovarian cance...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To morphometrically {{quantify}} CD 1 a+ <b>dentritic</b> <b>cells</b> and DC-SIGN+ dendritic {{cells in}} HIV-positive patients with anal squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and {{to evaluate the}} effects of HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy and HPV infection on epithelial and subepithelial dendritic cells. METHODS: A prospective study was performed to morphometrically analyze the relative volume of the dendritic cells {{and the relationship between}} anal intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer in HIV-positive patients from the Tropical Medicine Foundation of Amazonas, Brazil. All patients were submitted to biopsies of anorectal mucosa to perform a classic histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis, employing antibodies against CD 1 a and DC-SIGN for the morphometric quantification of dendritic cells. RESULTS: HIV-negative patients displayed a CD 1 a DC density significantly higher than that of HIV-positives patients (3. 75 versus 2. 54) (p= 0. 018), and in patients with severe anal intraepithelial neoplasia had correlated between DC CD 1 a density with levels of CD 4 + cells (p: 0. 04) as well as the viral load of HIV- 1 (p: 0. 035). A not significant rise in the median density of CD 1 a+ DC was observed in the HIV positive/ HAART positive subgroup compared to the HIV positive/ HAART negative subgroup. The CD 1 a+ DC were also significantly increased in HIV-negative patients with anorectal condyloma (2. 33 to 3. 53; p= 0. 05), with an opposite effect in HIV-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support an enhancement of the synergistic action caused by HIV-HPV co-infection on the anal epithelium, weakening the DC for its major role in immune surveillance. Notoriously in patients with severe anal intraepithelial neoplasia, the density of CD 1 a+ epithelial dendritic cells was influenced by the viral load of HIV- 1. Our study describes {{for the first time the}} density of subepithelial DC-SIGN+ dendritic cells in patients with anal severe anal intraepithelial neoplasia and points to the possibility that a specific therapy for HIV induces the recovery of the density of epithelial DC...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Insufficient {{apoptosis}} in activated lymphocytes {{contributes to}} the development of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Baicalein (BE), a flavonoid originally isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, possesses anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether BE can selectively induce apoptosis in activated lymphocytes and exert therapeutic effect on AIH has not been studied. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The pro-apoptotic properties of BE were evaluated in vitro on different types of immune cells, and in vivo effects of BE were examined in a murine model of Concanavalin A (Con A) -induced hepatitis. In vitro treatment with BE resulted in a higher increase in the level of apoptosis in Con A-stimulated murine splenocytes, Con A-stimulated CD 3 (+) splenocytes, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated CD 19 (+) splenocytes, and phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate/ionomycin-stimulated Jurkat T cells, compared with that in unstimulated naïve ones. Murine bone marrow-derived <b>dentritic</b> <b>cells,</b> peritoneal macrophages, and RAW 264. 7 cells, either stimulated with LPS or unstimulated, were all insensitive to the BE-induced apoptosis. BE treatment also led to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, an increase of cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol, a decrease in the ratio of Bcl- 2 /Bax, and activation of caspase- 9,- 3 in Con A-stimulated CD 3 (+) splenocytes and LPS-stimulated CD 19 (+) splenocytes, while showing no impact on Fas/FasL expressions and caspase- 8 activation. In vivo administration of BE alleviated Con A-induced liver injury, suppressed serum level of TNF-α and IFN-γ, and reduced liver infiltration of mononuclear cells (MNCs). Furthermore, BE treatment increased the incidences of apoptosis in liver-infiltrating MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in CD 3 (+) and CD 19 (+) splenocytes. When liver MNCs and splenocytes from BE-treated mice were cultured in vitro for 24 h, they exhibited marked increase in apoptosis compared to vehicle-treated control. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The present study demonstrates the ability of BE to promote apoptosis in activated lymphocytes through mitochondrial pathway and its potential use in the treatment of AIH...|$|E
