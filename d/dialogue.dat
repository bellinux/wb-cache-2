Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions.

5|$|At the Opéra-Comique, {{after its}} 1883 revival, Carmen was always {{presented}} in the <b>dialogue</b> version with minimal musical embellishments. By 1888, {{the year of the}} 50th anniversary of Bizet's birth, the opera had been performed there 330 times; by 1938, his centenary year, the total of performances at the theatre had reached 2,271. However, outside France the practice of using recitatives remained the norm for many years; the Carl Rosa Opera Company's 1947 London production, and Walter Felsenstein's 1949 staging at the Berlin Komische Oper, are among the first known instances in which the <b>dialogue</b> version was used other than in France. Neither of these innovations led to much change in practice; a similar experiment was tried at Covent Garden in 1953 but hurriedly withdrawn, and the first American production with spoken <b>dialogue,</b> in Colorado in 1953, met with a similar fate.|$|E
5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called <b>Dialogue</b> Wheel, where the player's <b>dialogue</b> options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is {{normally}} reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times. <b>Dialogue</b> choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E
