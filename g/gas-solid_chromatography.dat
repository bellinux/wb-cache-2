40|$|We {{investigate}} a system {{related to a}} particular isothermal <b>gas-solid</b> <b>chromatography</b> process, called ?Pressure Swing Adsorption?, with two species and instantaneous exchange kinetics. This system presents the particularity to have a linearly degenerate eigenvalue: this allows the velocity of the gaseous mixture to propagate high frequency waves. In case of smooth concentrations with a general isotherm, we prove L 1 stability for concentrations with respect to weak limits of the inlet boundary velocity. Using the Front Tracking Algorithm (FTA), we prove a similar result for concentrations with bounded variation (BV) under some convex assumptions on the isotherms. In both cases we show that high frequency oscillations with large amplitude of the inlet velocity can propagate without affecting the concentrations. Comment: submitted in MA...|$|E

This work objective was to present the analysis of methane concentration in the biogas originated from anaerobic treatment system of wastewater of coffee wet processing (CWP) at laboratory scale, using coffee coconut. The methane concentration were performed by <b>gas-solid</b> <b>chromatography</b> (GSC) analyses. The system was composed of a column Restek RT-Q-PLOT, with the stage sets, the divinyl-benzene, nitrogen as mobile phase and a flame ionization detector (FID). The results of the concentration of methane in the biogas ranged from 48. 60 to 68. 14 %. The upper and lower calorific values were 25, 654 and 23, 777 kJ. m- 3, respectively.

40|$|Element 114 was {{discovered}} in 2000 by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration, and in 2012 it was named flerovium. It belongs to the group 14 of the periodic table of elements. A strong relativistic stabilisation of the valence shell 7 s 27 p 21 / 2 is expected due to the orbital splitting and the contraction {{not only of the}} 7 s 2 but also of the spherical 7 p 21 / 2 closed subshell, resulting in the enhanced volatility and inertness. Flerovium was studied chemically by <b>gas-solid</b> <b>chromatography</b> upon its adsorption on a gold surface. Two experimental results on Fl chemistry have been published so far. Based on observation of three atoms, a weak interaction of flerovium with gold was suggested in the first study.

40|$|The {{migration}} velocity, {{the migratory}} activation {{energy and the}} action of molecular motion on migration were researched for five alkanes in the <b>gas-solid</b> <b>chromatography</b> of N(2) /GDX- 101 system. Maxwell distribution of energy which originally shows the molecule fraction of molecular translation energy exceeding E, was used for expressing the time fraction of the translation energy exceeding E. The kinetic energy of rotation and vibration was expressed by the times of kT/ 2 {{in the light of}} the principle of equiparation of energy, to modify the ideal equation. The migratory activation energy (E) which is calculated with the rate equation, could well explain the migration velocity. The kinetic energy of rotation and vibration observably influences E. These properties were also authenticated with the estimate of statistical thermodynamics. The calculation showed that E was obviously smaller than the desorption enthalpy (Delta H(Desorption)). The solute migration might not reach the state of desorption. The solute driven by mobile phase should mainly slip under the state of adsorption...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Chromatography {{has found}} an {{increasingly}} wide utilization in {{scientific and technological}} fields, even in some cases, has become indispensable methods for analysis and separation. Compared with its application, some common queries in chromatography still lack for good theoretical explanations, for instance, the action of flow rate of mobile phase on symmetry of peak. As is familiar to people, an increase in flow rate of mobile phase always causes theoretical plate number to decrease under normal conditions. At the same time, maybe the symmetry of chromatographic peak obviously increases, on the contrary. This result is self-contradictory. Why does the theoretical plate number not increase under the condition? Utilizing our prior paper on five plate numbers in chromatography, this paper points out why theoretical plate number decreases {{with an increase in}} symmetry of peak when flow rate of mobile phase increases. Based upon <b>gas-solid</b> <b>chromatography</b> results, the relation between flow rate of mobile phase and frequency of partition of solute, and the relation between flow rate and plate number are deduced. From the angle of theoretical model, this paper discusses the relation between solute partition in static mobile phase such as partition between two phases in plate theory and solute partition in flowing mobile phase such as Martin-Synge partition in slip mechanism, and their characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Various needle trap devices (NTDs) with {{different}} designs for different applications {{have been developed}} during the past decade. A theoretical model on the fundamentals of the NTD was recently proposed, which employed the theory of frontal (<b>gas-solid)</b> <b>chromatography</b> to describe the sampling process, where a gaseous sample was continuously introduced into the sorbent bed. In this investigation, different types of sorbent particles {{with different}} dimensions were packed into the needle as adsorbents. The effect of particle dimension, which would affect the packing density and consequently the capacity, the extraction efficiency, and desorption efficiency of the NTD were experimentally investigated and the proposed theory was validated. The results demonstrated that NTDs packed with small particles possess higher extraction capacity and efficiency but much higher resistance to flow as well. The higher resistance did not necessarily result in poor desorption efficiency, because desorption efficiency was affected by both the sorbent bed structure and the desorption gas flow. The relationships observed among those physical parameters provide valuable guidance on how to design an NTD with high performance potential for future applications. For particulate sampling, {{it was found that}} NTDs packed with different particles presented high collection efficiency of the particulates being investigated, and the collection efficiency was dominated by the pore size and distribution of the sorbent bed packed inside the needle. Collection efficiency also increased with increase in solidity of the sorbent bed; the increase in humidity of the aerosol sample; and the decrease of sampling rate. The results also provide valuable guidance on the optimisation of needle trap for particulate collection...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of correct determination {{of physical and}} chemical properties of natural gas is evident. The calculation of calorific value or hydrocarbon dew point requires detailed analysis as can be provided by gas chromatography. Analysis by gas chromatography is a necessary complement to direct measurement of physical properties. An accurate gas chromatographic analysis allows the calculation of various gas properties at the same time. Several schemes allowing accurate natural gas analysis by chromatography have been described in literature. Current column selection criteria to meet the requirements of a particular gas analysis will be presented. In the presentation the main emphasis will be on new developments in column technology for gas chromatography. Recent developments in capillary gas chromatography point in three directions: 1. Narrow bore thin film columns (typically 50 ~m inside diameter; 0. 05 ~m film thickness) allowing a high speed of separation and having large plate numbers per unit length. These columns having up to 1 million theoretical plates are eminently suited for a detailed analysis of the distribution of higher hydrocarbons in natural gas e. g. for dew point calculations. 2. Wide bore thick film columns. These columns with typical dimensions of 0. 5 mm inside diameter and a film thickness of 5 - 10 ~m of 'bonded phases', are relatively slow but offer improved resolution for the low boiling point components of natural gas. The sample capacity of a wide bore thick film column is at least two orders of magnitude larger than that of 50 ~m columns. This together with the large volumetric gas flows in wide bore columns enables their use in combination with heat conductivity detectors or FT-IR techniques. 3. The use of <b>gas-solid</b> <b>chromatography</b> in open tubular columns e. i. Molsieve 5 A PLOT columns for the analysis of permanent gases at ambient temperature; Aluminium oxide columns for highly selective separations of volatile hydrocarbons. A theoretical treatment will be presented showing the effect of column diameter and film thickness on speed of analysis, resolution, sample capacity, sample range, etc. The instrumental requirements of the different types of columns will be discussed. Examples on applications in natural gas analysis will be given...|$|E
