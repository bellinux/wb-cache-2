5|$|After India's independence, the Maharaja, Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, {{allowed his}} kingdom's {{accession}} to India. In 1950, Mysore became an Indian {{state of the}} same name; the former Maharaja served as its Rajpramukh (head of state) until 1975. Following the long-standing demand of the Ekikarana Movement, Kodagu- and Kannada-speaking regions from the adjoining states of Madras, Hyderabad and Bombay were incorporated into the Mysore state, under the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. The thus <b>expanded</b> <b>state</b> was renamed Karnataka, seventeen years later, in 1973. In the early 1900s through the post-independence era, industrial visionaries such as Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya, born in Muddenahalli, Chikballapur district, {{played an important role}} in the development of Karnataka's strong manufacturing and industrial base.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} early effects of U. S. state Medicaid {{expansions}} under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on substance use disorder (SUD) treatment utilization. We couple administrative data on admissions to specialty SUD treatment and prescriptions for medications {{used to treat}} SUDs in outpatient settings with a differences-in-differences design. We find no evidence that admissions to specialty treatment changed in <b>expanding</b> <b>states</b> relative to non-expending states. However, post expansion, Medicaid-reimbursed prescriptions for medications used to treat SUDs in outpatient settings increased by 33 % in <b>expanding</b> <b>states</b> relative to non-expanding states. Among patients admitted to specialty SUD treatment, we find that in <b>expanding</b> <b>states</b> Medicaid insurance and use of Medicaid to pay for treatment increased by 58 % and 57 % following the expansion. In an extension to the main analyses we find {{no evidence that the}} expansions affected fatal alcohol poisonings or drug-related overdoses. Overall, our findings provide evidence on the early effects of the ACA on SUD treatment utilization with the newly-eligible Medicaid population...|$|R
2500|$|Unlike nationalists, who esteem {{the role}} of the State or nation over the local or {{regional}} community, traditionalists hold up patriotism as a key principle.

Traditionalists also welcome the value of subsidiarity and the intimacy of one's community, preferring the Civil Society of Burke's [...] "little platoons" [...] over the <b>expanded</b> <b>state.</b> Alternately, nationalism leads to jingoism and views the state as abstract from the local community and family structure rather than as an outgrowth of these local realities.|$|E
