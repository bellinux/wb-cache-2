5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns sends hired goons to the Simpson {{house in}} order to take Homer back to Mr. Burns' Manor to negotiate. While Mr. Burns is setting the agenda for the discussion, Homer is struck by the urgent need to use the rest room. Homer asks Mr. Burns where the rest room is and {{immediately}} leaves, leading Mr. Burns to conclude that Homer <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> negotiator who is unwilling to even hear him out. At a later union meeting, Homer tries to resign, tired of meeting with Mr. Burns. The union misunderstands his frustration, and the members nearly unanimously decide to strike. Mr. Burns is undeterred by the strike and tries several methods of breaking it up, but fails. On an edition of Kent Brockman's talk show Smartline, Mr. Burns is allowed an opening tirade and he threatens dire events if the strike is not concluded.|$|E
5|$|Monique Jeffries <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> and street-wise detective {{with the}} Special Victims Unit of the New York City Police Department. After briefly partnering with Ken Briscoe (Chris Orbach), she becomes the {{permanent}} partner of John Munch (Richard Belzer) after his previous partner, Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters), leaves the unit. The two occasionally clash personalities {{and have a}} sarcastic rapport with each other. While chasing a rape suspect during one case, Jeffries is nearly killed when the suspect gets into a car that explodes. She initially appears traumatized by the incident, but later feels exhilarated over having survived and starts behaving recklessly. She begins having several one-night stands and takes greater and greater risks at work, becoming something of a loose cannon at the Special Victims Unit. One night at a bar, she meets {{a man who had}} been a suspect in a previous rape case and has sex with him. When she reveals the incident during a session with a police therapist, she is taken out of active duty per One Police Plaza and works a desk job. She objects to the transfer and threatens to sue the department. Instead, she is transferred to the Vice department, and her old job in the Special Victims Unit is taken by Fin Tutuola (Ice-T).|$|E

5|$|Still, Finley & Figg {{remains in}} bad shape. The Krayoxx affair has left them deep in debt {{instead of the}} {{expected}} big profit, their office building – the firm's sole asset – heavily mortgaged and the two partners ailing, in bad shape physically and mentally. Meanwhile, David manages to complete his lead poisoning product liability case, finding that the destructive toys were imported from China by a subsidiary of Sonesta Games, the third-largest toy producer in the U.S. Unlike the Krayoxx case, this provides David with an air-tight case. A jury seeing the poor child, completely disabled as a direct provable result of using the toy, would be certain to grant a high sum in compensations. Knowing this, the Sonesta CEO and his senior executives hasten to meet with David, seeming to show genuine remorse, aside from being aware of the grave damage which the publicity around such a case could cause their corporation. They readily agree to give David's clients, the child's Burmese immigrant parents $5 million in out-of-court compensation, provided that the case remain secret. David insists, however, that $1.5 million in legal fees would not {{come out of his}} clients' compensation but be paid separately by Sonesta; knowing himself to have the upper hand, Zinc <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> negotiator and the Sonesta directors {{have no choice but to}} agree to pay a total of $6.5 million. In parting, a Sonesta executive discreetly slips Zinc an unmarked envelope with information on lead poisoning caused by the products of Sonesta's competitors.|$|E

25|$|In Stewart's collaborations with {{director}} Anthony Mann, {{he entered}} {{the realm of the}} western. Stewart's first appearance in a film directed by Mann came with the 1950 western, Winchester '73. In choosing Mann (after first choice Fritz Lang declined), Stewart cemented a powerful partnership. The film, which became a box-office hit upon its release, set the pattern for their future collaborations. In it, Stewart <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough,</b> revengeful sharpshooter, the winner of a prized rifle which is stolen and then passes through many hands, until the showdown between Stewart and his brother (Stephen McNally).|$|E

25|$|As the Earth’s {{most common}} organic material, {{cellulose}} {{can be classified}} into plant cellulose and bacterial cellulose, {{both of which are}} naturally occurring. Plant cellulose, which makes up the cell walls of most plants, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough,</b> mesh-like bulkwork in which cellulose fibrils are the primary architectural elements. While bacterial cellulose has the same molecular formula as plant cellulose, it has significantly different macromolecular properties and characteristics. In general, microbial cellulose is more chemically pure, containing no hemicellulose or lignin, has a higher water holding capacity and hydrophilicity, greater tensile strength resulting from a larger amount of polymerization, ultrafine network architecture. Furthermore, bacterial cellulose can be produced on a variety of substrates and can be grown to virtually any shape due to the high moldability during formation. Additionally, bacterial cellulose has a more crystalline structure compared to plant cellulose and forms characteristic ribbon-like microfibrils. A hallmark of microbial cellulose, these thin microfibrils are significantly smaller than those in plant cellulose, making bacterial cellulose much more porous.|$|E

500|$|The endocervical mucosa {{is about}} [...] thick, lined {{with a single}} layer of {{columnar}} mucous cells, and contains numerous tubular mucous glands which empty viscous alkaline mucus into the lumen. In contrast, the ectocervix is covered with nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium, which resembles the squamous epithelium lining the vaginal. The junction between {{these two types of}} epithelia is called the squamocolumnar junction. [...] Underlying both types of epithelium <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> layer of collagen. The mucosa of the endocervix is not shed during menstruation. [...] The cervix has more fibrous tissue, including collagen and elastin, {{than the rest of the}} uterus.|$|E
500|$|Writing in the October 1951 {{issue of}} The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Anthony Boucher and J.

Reviewing the same edition, Groff Conklin termed it [...] "a silly idea inexpertly carried out". The New York Times reviewer Villiers Gerson found Typewriter to be [...] "an ironic and jaunty adventure story." [...] Damon Knight gave the book a mixed review, commenting, [...] "The problem [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> one, and Hubbard does not so much solve it as slide around it....

He added, [...] "But we've had a few exceptions." [...] According to Tom Kenny, main character SpongeBob's voice actor, [...] "One of the things networks always try to push is getting celebrities."

[...] Whenever [...] threatens to get boring, something always happens to recapture your interest." [...] Sarah Hajibegari from The Times felt that while [...] "Hard Candy is no disaster", the album's producers have [...] "already done the same thing with Nelly Furtado, Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani." [...] Andy Gill from The Independent said that the album portrayed Madonna as [...] "how a once diverse talent has ossified into simply satisfying the sweet tooth of functional dance-pop." [...] Thomas Hausner from PopMatters wrote that the album [...] "is overpopulated with recycled pop that is indistinguishable and artificial, something Madonna's soothing arpeggiating vocals cannot alleviate".|$|E
500|$|In a cold open scene, {{the parks}} {{department}} welcomes Ann (Rashida Jones) {{to her new}} office in city hall and fill it with balloons, much {{to the chagrin of}} her cranky officemate Stuart (Jim Jansen). Leslie (Amy Poehler) and Ben (Adam Scott) are dating, but they are keeping their relationship a secret due to a no-dating policy at work. They are enjoying what Leslie calls [...] "the bubble", or the beginning of a relationship when everything is simple and fun. It is suddenly threatened, however, when Ben has a meeting with Leslie's mother Marlene (Pamela Reed), a notoriously tough politician in the Pawnee school system, who wants Ben to approve the purchase of four new school buses despite a difficult budget season. Afraid of ruining the bubble, Leslie initially tells Ben she is not related to Marlene. Right before Ben's meeting, however, Leslie admits Marlene is her mother, making him nervous and causing him to capitulate to all of her demands during the meeting. Marlene considers Ben weak, so Leslie becomes determined to prove that he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> boss to impress Marlene.|$|E

In an interview in 2012, Watts said, [...] "I came to New York and auditioned {{at least five times}} for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'." [...] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that you have something to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit." [...] Watts studied the Meisner Technique.|$|E
