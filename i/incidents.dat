The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the <b>incidents</b> of a film's scenario are taken to be actual <b>incidents</b> in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express the personality of the type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently <b>incidents</b> in them echo <b>incidents</b> in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E

40|$|Effective traffic <b>incident</b> {{management}} {{is an important}} success factor in reducing <b>incident</b> duration and the severe resultant congestion impacts. As such by having proper and reliable traffic <b>incident</b> indicators can greatly improve prioritisation and deployment of effective rapid <b>incident</b> response. This research aimed to examine and improve indicators for better <b>incident</b> prioritisation and development of rapid <b>incident</b> response plans for Australian conditions. A review of current practices in Australia {{as well as in}} other countries, especially the US, was undertaken to assess traffic <b>incident</b> management strengths and weaknesses as a benchmark for the analysis. An examination of traffic <b>incident</b> records in south east Queensland was undertaken using logistic regression. Based on the findings, a rapid <b>incident</b> management plan has been developed that can assist traffic management centres in Australia to manage and deploy more effective traffic <b>incident</b> response.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of an <b>incident</b> {{is one of}} the main causes of traffic congestion and delay on urban freeways. Currently, the development of an efficient traffic <b>incident</b> management process is an emerging issue in intelligent transport systems. The focus of this study is to develop an <b>incident</b> response model for use in an <b>incident</b> management program designed to reduce <b>incident</b> related traffic congestion and delays. Establishing a fuzzy control system based on a real operation process of <b>incident</b> response would help decrease the workload of operators who are constantly making essential decisions, and would be helpful in developing a more reliable operation procedure. Traffic <b>incident</b> data obtained from traffic detectors and information systems on freeways should be considered in order to determine the best form of operation. In this study, a fuzzy <b>incident</b> response model is formulated in terms of <b>incident,</b> type of vehicle, type of <b>incident</b> vehicle, location of <b>incident</b> vehicle, and <b>incident</b> service time. In order to analyze the reliability of the proposed model, the application of the model is made using the actual <b>incident</b> data collected on the freeway in the Los Angeles area.
