5|$|On 14 August 1941, Mackay {{handed over}} {{command of the}} 6th Division to Herring. Mackay {{departed}} Cairo for Australia by flying boat on 22 August. En route, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> Singapore to confer with Bennett, now {{the commander of the}} 8th Division, which was based there, and had dinner at the Raffles Hotel with his son, Lieutenant Iven Mackay, an officer with the 8th Division's 2/18th Infantry Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his public}} nonchalance, Seward was devastated by his {{convention}} loss, as were {{many of his}} supporters. The New Yorker was the best-known and most popular Republican, and his defeat shocked many in the North, who felt that Lincoln had been nominated through chicanery. Although Seward sent a letter stating Weed was not to blame, Seward's political manager took the defeat hard. Seward was initially inclined to retire from public life, but received many letters from supporters: distrustful of Lincoln, they urged Seward to remain involved in politics. On his way to Washington to return to Senate duties, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> Albany to confer with Weed, {{who had gone to}} Lincoln's home in Springfield, Illinois to meet with the candidate, and had been very impressed at Lincoln's political understanding. At the Capitol, Seward received sympathy even from sectional foes such as Jefferson Davis.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a {{potential}} Democratic candidate for Vice President, though since {{he was born in}} what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an era when political convention delegates were far more free to make their own choices than they are today, Lane wrote that he had heard that he could gain the support of the New York delegation, which he declined to do. While returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C., as an advocate for the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> Austin, Texas, to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature. The New York Times saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he had been promised help from Texas.|$|E

50|$|Matt {{wakes up}} in the desert, with no one in sight. As he walks across the desert, <b>he</b> <b>stops</b> <b>in</b> front of a rock where {{the picture of the}} earth {{exploding}} is painted, identical to the one behind Mohinder.|$|R
5|$|Fliegerführer Afrika {{received}} orders on 4 August 1941 {{to downsize}} the 7. Staffel in Africa to four aircraft. The remaining aircraft and aircrews were {{to relocate to}} France back to Jagdgeschwader 26. Before Müncheberg arrived in France, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> Rome where he received the Gold Medal of Military Valour from Mussolini. He then travelled to the Wolf's Lair, Hitler's headquarters in Rastenburg, present-day Kętrzyn in Poland, for the Oak Leaves presentation. Following the presentation Müncheberg went on two weeks of vacation. Following their return from North Africa to France the pilots of 7. Staffel were given newer Bf109F-4 aircraft in replacement for the older Bf109E-7 type. Müncheberg claimed his first victory here on 28 August over a Spitfire and another one, his 50th overall, on 29 August. He claimed two Spitfires on 4 September and one more from No. 71 Squadron three days later.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Taraki {{attended}} {{a conference of}} the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana, Cuba. On his way back <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> Moscow on 20 March and met with Brezhnev, foreign minister Andrei Gromyko and other Soviet officials. It was rumoured that Karmal {{was present at the}} meeting in an attempt to reconcile Taraki's Khalq faction and the Parcham against Amin and his followers. At the meeting, Taraki was successful in negotiating some Soviet support, including the redeployment of two Soviet armed divisions at the Soviet-Afghan border, the sending of 500 military and civilian advisers and specialists, and the immediate delivery of Soviet armed equipment sold at 25 percent below the original price. However, the Soviets were not pleased about the developments in Afghanistan and Brezhnev impressed upon Taraki the need for party unity. Despite reaching this agreement with Taraki, the Soviets continued to be reluctant to intervene further in Afghanistan and repeatedly refused Soviet military intervention within Afghan borders during Taraki's rule as well as later during Amin's short rule.|$|E
5|$|In July 1860, Willis {{took his}} last major trip. Along with his wife, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> Chicago and Yellow Springs, Ohio, as far west as Madison, Wisconsin, and {{also took a}} {{steamboat}} down the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri, and returned through Cincinnati, Ohio and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1861, Willis allowed the Home Journal to break its pledge to avoid taking sides in political discussions when the Confederate States of America was established, calling the move a purposeful act to bring on war. On May 28, 1861, Willis {{was part of a}} committee of literary figures—including William Cullen Bryant, Charles Anderson Dana, and Horace Greeley—to invite Edward Everett to speak in New York on behalf of maintaining the Union. The Home Journal lost many subscribers during the American Civil War, Morris died in 1864, and the Willis family had to take in boarders and for a time turned Idlewild into a girls' school for income.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stops</b> <b>in</b> his rubbing {{and looks}} at her, with {{his hands on his}} knees. Imperturbable and {{unchangeable}} as he is, there is still an indefinable freedom in his manner which is new and which does not escape this woman's observation.|$|R
50|$|Playing {{until he}} either doubles his money or {{runs out of}} money is a {{stopping}} rule, {{even though there is}} potentially no limit to the number of games he plays, since the probability that <b>he</b> <b>stops</b> <b>in</b> a finite time is 1.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>stopped</b> acting <b>in</b> {{the late}} 1990s and {{announced}} his retirement in 2013.|$|R
5|$|On {{his way to}} Lima, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> Riobamba, where a {{group of}} priests asked him to write a reply to a report written by Ignacio Barreto, chief tax collector. The report accused the priests of Riobamba of various abuses against the Indians in order to take their money. Espejo gladly {{accepted}} the task because he wanted to settle accounts with Barreto and other citizens of Riobamba, among them José Miguel Vallejo, who had turned him in to the authorities when he tried to flee Requena's expedition to the Marañón river. He wrote Defensa de los curas de Riobamba (Defense of the clergy of Riobamba), a detailed study of the way of life of the Indians from Riobamba and a powerful attack on Barreto's report.|$|E
5|$|The King's {{capitulation}} {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Kościuszko, who had not lost a single battle in the campaign. By mid-September 1792 he was resigned to leaving the country, and in early October he departed from Warsaw. First he went east, to the Czartoryski family manor at Sieniawa, which gathered various malcontents. In mid-November he spent two weeks in Lwów (in Ukrainian, Lviv; in German, Lemberg), where he was welcomed by the populace; since the war's end, his presence had drawn crowds eager to see the famed commander. Izabela Czartoryska discussed having him marry her daughter Zofia. The Russians planned to arrest him if he returned to territory under their control; the Austrians, who held Lwów, offered him a commission in the Austrian Army, which he turned down. Subsequently they planned to deport him, but he left Lwów before they could do so. At {{the turn of the}} month, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> Zamość at the Zamoyskis' estate, met Stanisław Staszic, then went on to Puławy.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{was summoned}} to a Chapter Extraordinary of the Lateran Congregation, and his friends warned {{him that he had}} {{powerful}} adversaries. These increasingly foreboding events contributed to his decision to ignore the summons and flee, but he was finally persuaded by his conscience against the Masses he was bound to perform. Vermigli fled Lucca for Pisa on 12 August 1542 by horse with three of his canons. There he celebrated a Protestant form of the Eucharist for the first time. When <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> Florence, staying in Badia Fiesolana where he had entered religious life, Vermigli learned that Bernardino Ochino had arrived there. Vermigli convinced Ochino, a popular preacher with Protestant leanings, to flee Italy as well. On 25 August Vermigli left for Zürich by way of Ferrara and Verona.|$|E
50|$|A {{match with}} the American Kevin Kelley and British fighter Colin McMillan was mooted but Hodkinson {{first had to}} deal with WBC {{mandatory}} challenger Goyo Vargas. <b>He</b> <b>stopped</b> Hoko <b>in</b> seven rounds. Hodkinson's next fight was another defeat; this time in a WBO title fight against the Welshman Steve Robinson, when <b>he</b> was <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> the final round. Hoko never fought again.|$|R
50|$|After the Olympics, Larmour {{made the}} {{decision}} to turn professional, making his pro debut in July 1977 with a first-round knockout of Jimmy Bott. <b>He</b> was <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> his next two fights (by John Feeney and George Sutton) before beating Alan Oag (via disqualification) in May 1978. <b>In</b> June <b>he</b> was <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> the seventh round by Johnny Owen.|$|R

25|$|While in Zanesville, Ohio, for the {{formation}} of the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society, Rankin had his first real experience with mob opposition to his efforts as he was showered with rotten eggs in town. When <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> Chillicothe to speak at a church on the way home, stones were thrown through the window.|$|E
50|$|The film pays {{homage to}} The Magnificent Seven and Yul Brynner when <b>he</b> <b>stops</b> <b>in</b> New Mexico. When asked where he is from, he points behind himself. When asked where he is going, he points forward. This is exactly like the scene from The Magnificent Seven.|$|R

25|$|In 1929, Edward T.M. Carr - Superintendent of the Southern Division of the Long Branch Railroad made a {{good will}} tour.

25|$|On {{his way to}} Alexandria, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> Memphis to consecrate {{the sacred}} bull Apis. According to Suetonius, this caused consternation: the {{ceremony}} required Titus to wear a diadem, which the Romans associated with monarchy, and the partisanship of Titus's legions had already led to fears that he might rebel against his father. Titus returned quickly to Rome – hoping, says Suetonius, to allay any suspicions about his conduct.|$|E
