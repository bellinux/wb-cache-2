50|$|In {{front wheel}} drive vehicles, the drive shafts {{transfer}} the drive directly from the differential to the front wheels. A short inner stub shaft is splined to the <b>differential</b> <b>side</b> <b>gear</b> and an outer stub shaft is splined to the front wheel hub. Each stub shaft has a yoke, or housing, to accommodate a universal joint, {{at each end of}} a connecting intermediate shaft.|$|E

2500|$|The {{preferred}} form of LSD for drifting is {{the clutch}} type, in [...] "two-way" [...] form, for its consistent and aggressive lockup behavior under all conditions (acceleration and deceleration). Some drift cars use a spool [...] "differential", which actually has no differential action at all - the wheels are locked to each other. Budget-minded drifters may use a welded <b>differential,</b> where the <b>side</b> <b>gears</b> are welded {{to give the}} same effect as a spool. This {{makes it easier to}} break rear traction because it reduces maximum traction in all situations except traveling in a straight line. Welded differentials have an inherent risk involved: due to the tremendous amount of internal stress the welds may fail and the differential completely lock up leaving the rear wheels immobilized. Helical torque-sensing differentials such as the Torsen or Quaife (available on cars in certain stock trims such as S15, FD3S, MX-5, JZA80, UZZ3x) are also adequate. It is common for drifters to change the final gear ratio {{depending on the type of}} track layout.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bending fatigue {{is one of}} {{the main}} failure modes of gears. The method of gear fatigue design was {{discussed}} in many papers. Most of them are based on GB/T 3480 - 83. But study shows that the method current widely used only fits for the single <b>side</b> loaded <b>gear.</b> For double <b>sides</b> loaded <b>gear,</b> only a mean stress modification coefficient is concerned compared to single <b>side</b> loaded <b>gear.</b> A new formula based on fatigue theory is given to modify the mean stress in consideration of the load character of doubled <b>sides</b> loaded <b>gear.</b> The method given in the paper is an addition to the traditional gear design method...|$|R

50|$|Although {{a widely}} used system, {{this system is}} not as {{efficient}} as a system with locking hubs. A CAD system spins the axle shafts, spider <b>gears,</b> and <b>side</b> <b>gears</b> in the carrier during normal driving. Locking hubs disengage the axle at the wheels, allowing all of the axle to be at rest during normal driving. Not as efficient as locking hubs, a CAD system still makes for much less drag than having the axle completely locked in.|$|R
50|$|On either <b>side</b> of the <b>gear</b> are {{the thrust}} washers. The thrust washers are pushed against the ball {{bearings}} inside the gear by Belleville washers. On one <b>side</b> of the <b>gear</b> is an adjusting collar, {{which allows for}} adjustments {{in the amount of}} slip allowed by the differential. A thrust bearing (or thrust race), on the opposite <b>side</b> of the <b>gear,</b> is used to stop the differential from loosening the retaining screw holding the output cups, used to attach the differential to the axle, onto the differential.|$|R

25|$|Barrientos' {{dilemma of}} {{allegiance}} was resolved when Álvaro de Luna returned from abroad, bringing {{with him the}} support of the Diocese of Toledo, which had practically unlimited resources, and which had granted him their patronage at the behest of his half brother, Juan de Cerezuela. Greatly aided by their financial backing and political cachet, he was able to mobilize royalist supporters of the crown to fight for the king. While the two <b>sides</b> <b>geared</b> up for war (ultimately taking place in Olmedo), Barrientos, his course now clear, traveled to the town of Madrigal de las Altas Torres (northern Ávila) to convince the heir, Prince Henry, to forbear from taking up arms against his own father.|$|R
50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an axle shaft (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and <b>side</b> <b>gears</b> to spin, while the differential carrier, pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split axle shafts. The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|R

40|$|The report {{thoroughly}} {{discusses the}} theory of dynamics of planar mathematical-physical models of planetary differential and special cases of pseudoplanetary transmission systems.

The equations of motion are derived and compiled {{on the basis of the}} Lagrangian theory in a compact form and express the three areas of the gear mesh, ie. the range of normal gear mesh, gear backlash area and the area of the inverse gear mesh. After the rebound meshing gear profiles in the region of the <b>side</b> <b>gear</b> backlash, the impact effects occur when re contacting tooth flanks in both normal as well as during the eventual inverse mesh, depending on the size of the dynamic forces in the gearing...|$|R

2500|$|A {{landmark}} party {{meeting was}} held in December 1963, shortly after a military coup in Saigon in which Diệm was assassinated. North Vietnamese leaders debated the issue of [...] "quick victory" [...] vs [...] "protracted war" [...] (guerrilla warfare). After this meeting, the communist <b>side</b> <b>geared</b> up for a maximum military effort and PAVN troop strength increased from 174,000 {{at the end of}} 1963 to 300,000 in 1964. The Soviets cut aid in 1964 as an expression of annoyance with Hanoi's ties to China. Even as Hanoi embraced China's international line, it continued to follow the Soviet model of reliance on technical specialists and bureaucratic management, as opposed to mass mobilization. The winter of 1964–1965 was a high-water mark for the Việt Cộng, with the Saigon government on the verge of collapse. Soviet aid soared following a visit to Hanoi by Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin in February 1965. Hanoi was soon receiving up-to-date surface-to-air missiles.
