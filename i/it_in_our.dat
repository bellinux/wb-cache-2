25|$|Any {{family of}} sets that {{satisfies}} (2–4) is called a filter (an example: the complements to the finite sets, {{it is called the}} Fréchet filter and it is used in the usual limit theory). If (1) also holds, U is called an ultrafilter (because you can add no more sets to it without breaking it). The only explicitly known example of an ultrafilter is the {{family of sets}} containing a given element (in our case, say, the number 10). Such ultrafilters are called trivial, and if we use <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> construction, we come back to the ordinary real numbers. Any ultrafilter containing a finite set is trivial. It is known that any filter can be extended to an ultrafilter, but the proof uses the axiom of choice. The existence of a nontrivial ultrafilter (the ultrafilter lemma) can be added as an extra axiom, as it is weaker than the axiom of choice.|$|E

By the time the film came out (there were) these revelations that the Americans were torturing, the British were torturing.

The story, upon which this poem is founded, {{is one of the most}} interesting in the history of France, and is, in several respects, happily adapted to epic representation." [...] The review concluded: [...] "The general result of the impression which the perusal of this poem has made upon our minds is this: that, although the poem has some redundancies, which the chastised taste of maturer years would have struck out; though a manifest incongruity runs through the piece, in ascribing to characters of the fifteenth century the politics and metaphysics of an enlightened philosopher of the eighteenth; and though allegorical personages [...] but ill supply the place of that grand machinery [...] which have obtained the glorious meed of immortality; we, nevertheless, admire, the noble spirit of freedom, which is evidently the poet's inspiring muse".|$|E
