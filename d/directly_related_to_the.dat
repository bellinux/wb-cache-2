5|$|In all, about 15,000 damage {{claims were}} filed across Réunion, {{with a total}} of 3,251 homes damaged and about 850 {{condemned}} or destroyed. Property damage from the storm amounted to €95 million (US$83.4 million). Collectively, losses on the island were estimated at €200 million (US$190 million).

5|$|Aqil's father, Musa Agha al-Hasi, {{himself a}} {{commander}} of Hawwara irregulars {{in the service}} of Acre's Ottoman governors, had left Egypt for Gaza in 1814. He was not <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ainawiyeh or Hawwara tribes, but claimed descent from the Hawwara as a matter of convenience and prestige. Musa originally hailed from the al-Bara'asa tribe of Cyrenaica (modern-day eastern Libya). Likewise, James Finn, the British consul in Jerusalem (1846–1863), claims Aqil's family was of Algerian or North African origin. Musa Agha resided in the Galilee around 1820 and married a Turkmen woman. Aqil was born to the couple in the Nazareth area. According to historian Adel Manna, Aqil was born in Gaza. Musa had two other sons, Ali and Salih. Musa died in Gaza in 1830.|$|E
5|$|Bedell {{sponsored}} several bold initiatives {{during his}} tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents' problems with the barge industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 {{that would require the}} barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate.|$|E

A novel based on the game written by Midori Tateyama was released in July 1998 by Movic. The game's original soundtrack was released bundled with Dōseis soundtrack in August 2000 at Comiket 58; Dōsei was Tactics' first game.

5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others not <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, {{made it impossible to}} analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relativistic}} {{effects are}} <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relativity of direction. One is geodetic precession: the axis {{direction of a}} gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared, for instance, with the direction of light received from distant stars—even though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a direction as stable as possible ("parallel transport"). For the Moon–Earth system, this effect has been measured {{with the help of}} lunar laser ranging. More recently, it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to a precision of better than 0.3%.|$|E
5|$|Strong winds from Isabel {{extended}} from North Carolina to New England and westward to West Virginia. The winds, combined with previous rainfall which moistened the soil, downed many trees and power lines across its path, leaving about 6million electricity customers without power at some point. Parts of coastal Virginia, {{especially in the}} Hampton Roads and Northeast North Carolina areas, were without electricity for almost a month. Coastal areas suffered from waves and its powerful storm surge, with areas in eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia reporting severe damage from both winds and the storm surge. Throughout its path, Isabel resulted in $3.6billion in damage (2003USD, $ USD) and 51deaths, of which 16 were <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> storm's effects.|$|E

5|$|The last Hindu {{function}} for Hell-based reincarnations is the text Preta khanda in the Garuda Purana used by Hindu priests during Śrāddha rituals. During these rituals, {{the soul of}} a dying or deceased individual is given safe passage into the next life. This ritual is <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> economic prosperity of Hindu priests and their ability to “save” the dying soul from a hellish reincarnation through gifts given on behalf of the deceased to the priest performing the ritual. With each gift given, crimes committed during the deceased's life are forgiven and the next life is progressively improved.|$|E
5|$|There are {{dynamical}} forces {{acting on}} the particles in the Universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, {{it was expected that}} the rate of increase of the Hubble Constant would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be consistent with −1 but not zero, which implied that the present-day rate of increase of the Hubble Constant is increasing over time.|$|E

5|$|Daisy re-strengthened into a Category2 {{later on}} October6, and peaked with winds of 110mph (175km/h). The outerbands of Daisy {{produced}} strong winds and heavy surf in Bermuda, but caused no damage. It weakened {{back to a}} Category1 again on October7. While passing offshore New England, the storm, combined with a nor'easter, produced flooding and strong winds. Two fatalities were <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hurricane, and 24other people died in traffic related deaths, that were caused by slick roads from the heavy rain. Total damage in New England {{was estimated to be}} over $1.1million (1962USD). Early on October8, Daisy made landfall near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, several hours before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. In Atlantic Canada, the storm brought rough seas, causing coastal flooding and six fatalities in Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|During the referendum, 84% of the {{approximately}} 7.5 million voters approved the amendments. On November 28 of that year, President Lukashenko signed the changes into law. Other results not <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> voting included the expanding role of the Council of Ministers, which allowed it to deal with issues related to development of economic, social and political spheres within Belarus. The 1996 referendum was not, however, the first call to dissolve the Supreme Soviet. In 1991 and 1992, after the August coup in Moscow by senior CPSU officials, democratic forces in the government wanted to dissolve the Supreme Soviet permanently. The members of the Belarusian Popular Front pressed for a referendum, and despite achieving the number of signatures required by law at the time, the Supreme Soviet quashed the measure.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is {{the geometric}} theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 {{and the current}} description of gravitation in modern physics. It {{is the basis of}} current cosmological models of the Universe. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the acceleration of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the Universe over time.|$|E
