50|$|The first iteration, {{released}} in 2005, did not feature mechanical <b>keyswitches,</b> {{but in addition}} to the blank keycaps, it featured a Model-M-inspired design, and individually weighted keypresses, because some keys are pressed with less force than other keys.|$|R
50|$|Das Keyboard is {{a series}} of {{computer}} keyboards sold by Metadot Corporation, a software company located in Austin, Texas. Some models feature blank keycaps, supposedly to help improve touch typing skills and eliminate the need to rearrange keys for alternative keyboard layouts. Labeled versions have also been available since 2008. The current iterations employ mechanical <b>keyswitches</b> manufactured by either Cherry or Greetech.|$|R
50|$|The {{keyboard}} of the UK101 {{is located}} on the main PCB, and comprises a matrix of <b>keyswitches.</b> The matrix is interfaced to the CPU via two 8-bit I/O ports, and is polled by firmware in the machine's ROMs. One key is a latching type, the shift-lock key. When supplied as a kit, the keyboard was assembled by the purchaser from a bag of switches and keytops.|$|R
5000|$|A keycap is a {{small plastic}} cover placed over the <b>keyswitch</b> of a {{computer}} keyboard. Keycaps are illustrated to indicate the [...] or alphanumeric character they correspond to. Early keyboards were manufactured with the <b>keyswitch</b> and keycap integrated in one unit; separate keycaps were introduced to facilitate the production of different keyboard layouts.|$|E
50|$|The 380Z was {{packaged}} in a large, black, 19-inch rack-mount, rectangular metal case containing the power supply, {{a number of}} printed circuit boards and the optional 5¼-inch floppy disk drives. The front panel {{had a pair of}} strong carrying handles, a <b>keyswitch</b> and a reset button. The <b>keyswitch</b> controlled power and also enabled the reset button. The keyboard was separate and came in a tough metal case.|$|E

50|$|The Anykey {{does not}} use the same distinctively loud {{buckling}} spring <b>keyswitches</b> of the older “battleship” keyboards, and is significantly larger, heavier, and more durable than most modern keyboards {{in addition to being}} serviceable (though some versions more serviceable than others; see above). The Anykey lacks Windows and multimedia keys except for model 2194002-XX-XXX, shipped by Gateway at the beginning of 1996 with Windows 95, which had Windows keys. There are Anykey keyboards dated as late as 1998. This model works correctly in normal mode under Windows 7.|$|R
50|$|The {{keyboard}} ports {{are located}} at address DF00 (hex), or 57088 (decimal). BASIC programs typically poll for real-time keyboard input {{by using the}} PEEK and POKE commands at that address. Because the keyboard lacks any way to generate an interrupt, {{it is not possible}} to implement a typeahead buffer. The keyboard matrix also lacks any diodes at the intersections of the matrix. This leads to problems when reading certain combinations of keys pressed simultaneously. The matrix was designed to allow only the shift, control and shift-lock keys to be pressed simultaneously with another key. The <b>keyswitches</b> themselves were originally manufactured by Cherry.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Das Keyboard Model S" [...] was {{introduced}} in late 2009, {{and continues to be}} sold today. It contains revised electronics to address some of the common complaints along with supporting media keys and PS/2 operation. Again, it is shipped in both Ultimate (unlabeled) and Professional (labeled) versions, both 104- and 105-key, {{with the addition of a}} labeled Professional Silent model [...] featuring non-clicky but tactile MX brown stem <b>keyswitches.</b> The latter is intended for applications demanding lower noise levels than obtained with the regular clicky MX blue stem switches while retaining a similar tactile characteristic.|$|R

5000|$|The {{keyboard}} on the Compact was {{the first}} to move away from using the traditional [...] "sprung-key" [...] <b>keyswitch</b> design used {{by the rest of the}} BBC Micro family. Instead, it used a rubber-plastic moulding membrane.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Zenith Data Systems shipped {{a number of}} laptop {{computers}} equipped with a device called [...] "J-Mouse", which essentially used a special <b>keyswitch</b> under the J key to allow the J keycap {{to be used as}} a pointing stick.|$|E
50|$|Introduced {{and sold}} with the Macintosh Classic and LC in 1990, this {{keyboard}} was {{almost identical to}} the original ADB Keyboard, but included flip down feet to change the typing angle and a design change that gave the frame and keys a more streamlined appearance. Internally, the M0487 differed from the original M0116, as the M0487 did not use mechanical <b>keyswitches</b> (save for the Caps Lock). In 1993, the Macintosh TV, the first Mac introduced in all black, came with an identical black Keyboard II (using the same model number). This keyboard marked the return of Apple including a standard keyboard together with the computer itself.|$|R
5000|$|A {{buckling}} {{spring is}} a type of <b>keyswitch</b> mechanism, popularized by IBM's keyboards for the PC, PC/AT, 5250/3270 terminals, PS/2, and other systems. It was used by IBM's Model F keyboards (for instance the AT keyboard), and the more common Model M. It is described in [...] (Model F) and [...] (Model M), both now expired.|$|E

This does not indicate the pack voltage; it is only an indication to the driver that the vehicle is enabled.(has been started). The vehicle's main contacts will not close until the pre-charge is complete.|$|E
50|$|Matias Corporation is a {{computer}} accessories manufacturer, based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The company was founded in 1990 by Edgar Matias, Steve McGowan, and James McGowan. Matias' first hardware product was the Half Keyboard, a one-handed keyboard that exploits users' existing touch-typing skills. It can be learned {{in a matter of}} minutes. The company's first commercially successful product was Tactile Pro Keyboard. It was built from the same <b>keyswitch</b> technology (Alps switches) used in the Apple Extended Keyboard, widely viewed as the best keyboard Apple ever made.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{feature of}} the {{original}} keyboard is the relatively loud [...] "click" [...] sound each key made when pressed. Since typewriter users were accustomed to keeping {{their eyes on the}} hardcopy they were typing from and had come to rely on the mechanical sound that was made as each character was typed onto the paper to ensure that they had pressed the key hard enough (and only once), the PC keyboard used a <b>keyswitch</b> that produced a click and tactile bump intended to provide that same reassurance.|$|E
5000|$|A {{special case}} of the {{computer}} keyboard dome-switch is the scissor-switch. The keys {{are attached to the}} keyboard via two plastic pieces that interlock in a [...] "scissor"-like fashion, and snap to the keyboard and the key. It still uses rubber domes, but a special plastic [...] 'scissors' mechanism links the keycap to a plunger that depresses the rubber dome with a much shorter travel than the typical rubber dome keyboard. Typically scissor-switch keyboards also employ 3-layer membranes as the electrical component of the switch. They also usually have a shorter total key travel distance (2 mm instead of 3.5 - 4 mm for standard dome-switch keyswitches). This type of <b>keyswitch</b> is often found on the built-in keyboards on laptops and keyboards marketed as 'low-profile'. These keyboards are generally quiet and the keys require little force to press.|$|E
5000|$|Updated {{versions}} of the Surface's cover accessories are available for the Surface 2; the Touch Cover 2 and Type Cover 2 are slightly thinner than the previous versions and now include a [...] "dynamic" [...] backlight system. The Touch Cover 2 has over 1,092 sensors on it compared to just 80 on the original Touch Cover. The <b>keyswitch</b> length of the Type Cover 2 have been reduced from 2.5mm to 1.5mm. A new Power Cover accessory was also available to add 30 Wh additional battery capacity to the device. Accompanying the Touch Cover 2 and Type Cover 2 was a wireless adapter {{that allows them to}} be connected up to 30 feet away via Bluetooth. An updated kickstand can now be tilted at a 55-degree angle alongside the original 22-degree angle. During its unveiling, Microsoft also showcased the Music Cover; a variation of the Touch Cover that serves as a DJ mixer with playback controls, a 16-button sampler, and three sliders. While mainstream public release has been announced, it will be distributed to musicians through the Surface Remix Project campaign.|$|E
50|$|A car key or an {{automobile}} key {{is a key}} used to open and/or start {{an automobile}}. Modern key designs are usually symmetrical, and some use grooves on both sides, rather than a cut edge, to actuate the lock. It has multiple uses for the automobile with which it was sold. A car key can open the doors, as well as start the ignition, open the glove compartment and also open the trunk (boot) of the car. Some cars come with an additional key known as a valet key that starts the ignition and opens the driver's side door, but prevents the valet from gaining access to valuables that {{are located in the}} trunk or the glove box. Some valet keys, particularly those to high-performance vehicles, {{go so far as to}} restrict the engine's power output to prevent joyriding. Recently, features such as coded immobilizers have been implemented in newer vehicles. More sophisticated systems make ignition dependent on electronic devices, rather than the mechanical <b>keyswitch.</b> A number of these systems, such as KeeLoq and Megamos Crypto have been demonstrated to be weak and vulnerable to cryptanalytic attacks.|$|E
5000|$|Updated {{versions}} of the Surface's cover accessories are available for the Surface Pro 2; the Touch Cover 2 and Type Cover 2 are slightly thinner than the previous versions and now include a [...] "dynamic" [...] backlight system. The Touch Cover 2 has over 1,092 sensors on it compared to just 80 on the original Touch Cover. The <b>keyswitch</b> length of the Type Cover 2 have been reduced from 2.5mm to 1.5mm.

While mainstream public release has been announced, it will be distributed to musicians through the Surface Remix Project campaign. Microsoft also introduced a new accessory called the Docking Station. The Docking Station works exclusively with the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2, and not with the Surface RT or Surface 2. This desktop style peripheral attaches {{to the back of the}} Surface, adding three USB 2.0 ports, one USB 3.0 port, one Gigabit Ethernet port, one mini DisplayPort and 3.5mm audio input/output ports. It supports a resolution of 3840 x 2160 (commonly known as 4K or Ultra HD).|$|E
50|$|The AnyKey uses rubber {{dome type}} key{{switches}}, {{with all the}} switches and contact points on a single sheet. The <b>keyswitch</b> layer contacts a single flexible membrane that detects all keypresses and directs them to the controller board via a pair of flexible edge connectors. While the AnyKey is branded as a Gateway product, the membrane layer clearly bears the inscription “Maxi Switch Inc,” revealing the true maker of the hardware. This membrane is backed by a metal plate approximately a sixteenth of an inch thick which serves to hold the membrane rigid and in place as well as giving the keyboard considerable heft. Held in place {{on top of the}} rubber dome layer is a plastic block that holds the key pillars which in turn hold the keycaps themselves. The key pillars are individually replaceable but cannot be removed without dismantling the keyboard to separate the rubber dome layer from the plastic support layer and the removal of the latter from the assembly. The key caps are held onto the pillars via friction with cross shaped pegs. The key caps are easily removed for cleaning or rearrangement, as all keys on the keyboard use the same attachment method and, {{with the exception of the}} Space Bar, Enter, Shift, Tab, Control, Alt, and Caps Lock keys, they are all the same size. In this manner, keys that have been remapped (like the commonly remapped arrow keys) can also be physically moved to the correct location on the board. Physical relocation of keytops should be done with caution as the slope of the keytops is raked into three pairs of rows, e.g. if the Z key is swapped with the F1 key, both keys will have different rake to those surrounding them.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effects of <b>keyswitch</b> {{orientation}} on joint torques. Background: The fingertip produces primarily vertical forces during single-finger tapping on a computer <b>keyswitch.</b> However, horizontal force components within the sagittal plane of the finger could reduce net joint torques. Method: Eleven participants tapped on a <b>keyswitch</b> oriented in three directions: vertical, tilted 30 ° such that when pressed it moved away from the user (similar to a positive-tilt keyboard), and tilted 30 ° such that when pressed it moved toward the user (similar to a negative-tilt keyboard). Participants also tapped on a prototype cantilever <b>keyswitch</b> design in which the key cap moves along the arc of a bending beam gradually away from the user. Miniature electro-optical goniometers measured the finger posture, and a two-axis force sensor measured fingertip forces. Results: Tapping on a <b>keyswitch</b> oriented such that it moves away from the user when pressed reduced net joint torques by 47 % relative to tapping on a vertically orientated <b>keyswitch</b> and by 56 % relative to tapping on a <b>keyswitch</b> oriented toward the user, whereas the cantilever design resulted in 14 % decreases in net joint torque relative to the vertical orientation. Conclusion: Reductions of torques resulted from decreasing the moment arm of the fingertip force about the joints. Application: Keyboard design should incorporate <b>keyswitch</b> mechanism angles along with other postural and geometric constraints to reduce exposure of the finger joints and muscles to force during typing...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel {{system that allows}} the user to customize playback facilities in our computer-assisted envi-ronment, PWGL. The scheme {{is based on a}} class hierarchy. The behavior of an abstract root playback class containing a set of methods can be customized through inheritance. This procedure is demonstrated by a subclass that is capable of playing MIDI data. This playback device allows to realize automatically multi-instrument and micro-tonal scores by using pitchbend setups and channel mappings. Also contin-uous control information can be given in a score by adding dynamics markings and/or special Score-BPF expressions containing break-point functions. We give several complete code examples that demonstrate how the user could further change the playback behavior. We start with a simple play-back device that allows to override channel information. Next we discuss how to implement the popular <b>keyswitch</b> mechanism in our system. This playback device is capable of mapping high-level score information with commercial orchestral database supporting <b>keyswitch</b> instruments. Our final example shows how to override the default MIDI out-put and delegate the play events to an external synthesizer using OSC. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} {{the role of the}} wrist, elbow and shoulder joints to single-finger tapping. Six human subjects tapped with their index finger at a rate of 3 taps/s on a <b>keyswitch</b> across five conditions, one freestyle (FS) and four instructed tapping strategies. The four instructed conditions were to tap on a <b>keyswitch</b> using the finger joint only (FO), the wrist joint only (WO), the elbow joint only (EO), and the shoulder joint only (SO). A single-axis force plate measured the fingertip force. An infra-red active-marker three-dimensional motion analysis system measured the movement of the fingertip, hand, forearm, upper arm and trunk. Inverse dynamics estimated joint torques for the metacarpal-phalangeal (MCP), wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints. For FS tapping 27 %, 56 %, and 18 % of the vertical fingertip movement were a result of flexion of the MCP joint and wrist joint and extension of the elbow joint, respectively. During the FS movements the net joint powers between the MCP, wrist and elbow were positively correlated (correlation coefficients between 0. 46 and 0. 76) suggesting synergistic efforts. For the instructed tapping strategies (FO, WO, EO, and SO), correlations decreased to values below 0. 35 suggesting relatively independent control of the different joints. For FS tapping, the kinematic and kinetic data indicate that the wrist and elbow contribute significantly, working in synergy with the finger joints to create the fingertip tapping task. © 2007...|$|E
40|$|A single keycap on a {{standard}} alphanumeric computer keyboard was instrumented with a piezoelectric load cell and the fingertip motion was recorded with a high-speed video motion analysis system. Contact force histories between the fingertip and the keycap were recorded while four subjects typed {{a standard}} text for five minutes. Each keystroke force history is characterized by three distinct phases: (I) <b>keyswitch</b> compression, (II) finger impact and (III) fingertip pulp compression and release. Each keystroke force history contained two relative maxima, one in phase II and one in phase III. The subject mean peak forces ranged from 1. 6 to 5. 3 N and the subject mean peak fingertip velocities ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 7 m/s. Motion analyses and force measurements suggest a ballistic model of finger motion during typing...|$|E
40|$|A {{switching}} control {{system has been}} designed and built to provide the capability of rapidly switching the waveguide and low-level cabling between different klystrons to operate the Advanced Photon Source storage ring {{in the event of}} a failure of a klystron system or to perform necessary repairs and preventative maintenance. The twelve possible modes of operation allow for complete redundancy of the booster synchrotron rf system and either a maximum of two storage ring rf systems to be completely off-line or one system to be used as a power source for an rf test stand. A programmable controller is used to send commands to intermediate control panels which interface to WR 2300 waveguide switches and phase shifters, rf cavity interlock and low-level rf distribution systems, and klystron power supply controls for rapid reconfiguration of the rf systems in response to a mode-selection command. Mode selection is a local manual operation using a <b>keyswitch</b> arrangement which prevents more than one mode from being selected at a time. The programmable controller also monitors for hardware malfunction and guards against {open_quotes}hot-switching{close_quotes} of the rf systems. The rf {{switching control}}s system is monitored via the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) for remote system status check...|$|E
