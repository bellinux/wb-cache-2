40|$|The {{existence}} of an <b>index</b> <b>cycle,</b> a quasi-periodic oscillation in {{the strength of the}} zonal wind intensity, would offer the possibility of predicting an important atmospheric feature over the period of at least one oscillation. To determine whether such a cycle exists, daily time series of several different atmospheric variables for the period November 1 -April 30 for 1974 - 1977 were assembled. Here, the height of the 500 mb surface at latitudes 60 N and 30 N is considered. It is shown that (1) there is evidence that an <b>index</b> <b>cycle</b> exists, (2) there is theoretical reason to expect multiply periodic atmospheric flow patterns, and (3) a relatively simple, dynamically sound prediction scheme can be proposed...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} features of the circulation of February 1952 was the occurrence of a pronounced cycle in the zonal index during the month. The <b>index</b> <b>cycle</b> is defined as a gradual decline of the strength of the temperate-latitude westerlies from comparatively high to low values, followed by a similar rise. Namias [I] has shown that cycles lasting several weeks are prone to occur during February and March. This year the minimum point in the <b>index</b> <b>cycle</b> occurred near the middle of February, at least ten days earlier than all but one period studied by Namias, and more t,han twenty days earlier than the cycle in 1951 which was described by the author [2]. Figure 1 shows the time variation of the 5 -day mean values of the temperate-latitude 700 -mb. zonal index for the Western Hemisphere. The beginning of the <b>index</b> <b>cycle</b> may be defined as the high point in the graph, a value of 14. 2 m/sec (more than 3 m/sec above normal) observed during the period centered on February 1. Incidentally this was the highest zonal index value observed during any 5 -day mean period of the entire 1951 - 52 winter season. Note how the index values declined almost steadily until the very low value of 4. 7 m/sec (more than 5 m/sec below normal) was reached on February 18. After a fairly slow rise during the next two weeks the index reached a value slightly above normal again o...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} examine quantitatively the {{evidence}} for an <b>index</b> <b>cycle,</b> 21 years of daily 700 -mb. zonal index data for the western longitudes of the Northern Hemisphere were subjected to cross-spectral analyses. The annual variation of the {{mean and standard deviation}} of the three zonal indices (polar, temperate, and subtropical) was removed by a standardizing procedure utilizing time-smoothed annual curves. The variance (power) spectra of the individual indices indicated’that their correlation structure can be closely approximated by a first-order Markov scheme. No evidence was found for an excess of variance in the range of period (3 to 8 weeks) assigned to the <b>index</b> <b>cycle</b> by subjective means. The cospectra all indicated negative covariability among the indices as would be expected from circulation patterns characteristic of index-cycle-like behavior, but none showed an excess of negative covariability within the period range of interest. Coherence values, indicating the degree of relationship among the various indices, also did not show maxima in the required period range. The distributions of the standardized indices were found to be slightly skewed {{in the case of the}} subtropical and temperate indices and normal in the case of the polar index. In addition, a significant seasonal variation in the cor-relation and cross-correlation structure of the indices was found. Such nonstationarity complicates the interpreta-tion of the cross spectra. The conclusion of the statistical study of the zonal index data is that there is 110 evidence for sequential varia-tions and covariations of the strength of the westerlies at various latitudes with any preferred range of period. Rather, significant relationships hold over a very broad range of period. 1...|$|E

40|$|During the northerm {{summer monsoon}} period, the {{cloudiness}} fluctuation {{over and around}} India shows a predominant periodicity of 30 to 40 days as a major active-break cycle of monsoon activity, and this fluctuation appears as a northward phase shift of maximum (or minimum) cloudiness from the equatorial Indian Ocean toward the Himalayas (T.

Samples of these charts reveal the wealth of information available about the radiation patterns over the earth and about the synoptic distributions of the major cloud fields. Mean maps of outgoing long-wave radiation for four periods of generally more abundant radiation data portray the broad-scale variations in the radiation pattern both geographically and in time. For the Northern Hemisphere these maps show how the long-wave radiation varied during some very largescale changes in 700 -mb. mean flow which {{were part of a}} remarkable energy, or <b>index,</b> <b>cycle</b> in this period. Most pronounced were the sharp decreases in outgoing radiation that accompanied the penetration of westerlies into the subtropics where anticyclones had prevailed previously.

Methods An observational study included 1333 consecutive women undergoing invitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). 964 women were having their first cycle of ART. Data were entered prospectively. All women had serum LH measured in the 6 months before the <b>index</b> <b>cycle</b> studied. No repeat cycles were included. The main outcomes measured were clinical pregnancy (CP) and live birth (LB) correlation to serum LH. Forward multivariate stepwise regression analysis was applied, and other statistical tests were used as appropriate. Results There was non significant correlation between basal serum LH and CP and LB in the polycystic ovary syndrome group (R 2 = 0. 02, F = 1. 7 and P = 0. 76) (R 2 = 0. 01, F = 2. 6 and P = 0. 77) respectively after adjusting for age, BMI, day of oocyte retrieval, starting dose, total dose of stimulation, type of gonadotrophin used, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate and number of embryos transferred.

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{regime in}} the United States during January was in sharp contrast with the December regime. In December only the extreme east and west coasts had temperatures that were near or below normal. Elsewhere in the country during December temperatures were above normal with the greatest anomalous warmth observed in {{the central part of}} the Nation [l]. However, in January most of the United States experienced below normal temperatures with the near or above normal temperatures restricted to the Northeast and parts of the Far West. This reversal of the temperature regime was associated with an <b>index</b> <b>cycle</b> such as described by Namias [2, 3, 4]. The major thrust of the cold wave which came late in January was associated with blizzard conditions over the Appalachians and east coastal areas. Very widespread snowfall occurred with several storms, and only in the southernmost States did the ground remain free of snow at the end of the month (fig. 1). 2. MEAN CIRCULATION The 700 -mb. flow at the beginning of January was one of quite high zonal index for middle latitudes of the Western Hemisphere, but this index dropped steadily reaching a rather low value in the latter half of the month (fig. 2).

40|$|December's mean {{circulation}} in the Northern Hemisphere was quite asymmetrical about the North Pole, {{as shown by}} the fields of mean 700 -mb. height and its departure from normal (fig. l). The large positive anomaly over northern Siberia, for instance, contrasted with negative values at similar latitudes in the Western Hemisphere. It is not unusual for adjacent regional circulations to be different in form, in the sense that one may exhibit highindex characteristics while low index is observed in t,he other [I, 2, 31. Such was the case in December 1956. It is perhaps more unusual for the entire Western Hemisphere to fit into the high-index category as well as it ' did this month. While no quantitative measure of {{circulation in}}dices is routinely available for the Eastern Hemisphere, the departure from normal (DN) pattern in figure 1 leaves little doubt that a low zonal index and high-latitude blocking were dominant features of the circulation in that region. The positive anomaly center ($ 550 ft.) over northern Siberia was t'he largest 700 -mb. height departure from normal in the Northern Hemisphere. An extension of the surrounding positive DN field eastward to the Bering Sea was accompanied by a large area of negative anomaly in the west-central Pacific. Eastward from the central Pacific, however, the pattern exhibited a number of features typically associated with high index, among them an unusually deep Icelandic Low and abnormally strong subtropical ridges in the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic Oceans.
