5|$|Takanohana was the {{youngest}} ever {{to reach the top}} division at just 17, and he set a number of other age-related records. He had a solid but aggressive style, looking to get a right <b>hand</b> <b>grip</b> on his opponents' mawashi and move them quickly out of the ring. He won over half his bouts by a straightforward yori-kiri, or force out. In his later career he suffered increasingly from injuries, and he retired in January 2003 at the age of 30. He is now the head coach of Takanohana stable and {{a senior member of the}} Japan Sumo Association.|$|E
25|$|In March, he also {{purchased}} a new Kel-Tec 9mm Sub Rifle 2000 (a carbine hybrid of a pistol {{and a long}} gun with a folding stock, <b>hand</b> <b>grip,</b> and a rifle barrel) in Connecticut for $400.|$|E
25|$|Exclusive to Japan is the Uncharted 3-themed tan {{and brown}} color scheme DualShock 3 {{controller}}. The limited edition controller features a two-tone color scheme, with a map design and {{a smattering of}} mountains and coastlines sketched across the control pad. With {{a high level of}} detail, the controller also sports a compass drawn behind the directional pad, and Nathan Drake's signature ring on the right <b>hand</b> <b>grip.</b> It was bundled with the game for a collective cost of 9,980 yen ($129) for a limited time.|$|E

25|$|A force {{applied at}} {{a right angle}} to a lever multiplied by its {{distance}} from the lever's fulcrum (the length of the lever arm) is its torque. A force of three newtons applied two metres from the fulcrum, for example, exerts the same torque as a force of one newton applied six metres from the fulcrum. The direction of the torque can be determined by using the right <b>hand</b> <b>grip</b> rule: if the fingers of the right hand are curled {{from the direction of}} the lever arm to the direction of the force, then the thumb points in the direction of the torque.|$|E
25|$|Each Companion cavalryman was {{equipped}} with a 3-metre double-ended spear/lance with a cornel wood shaft called the xyston. The double spear points meant that, should the xyston break during a battle, the rider need only turn his weapon around to re-arm himself. The Thessalian and Greek cavalry would have been armed similarly to the Companions. The xyston was used to thrust either overarm or underarm with the elbow flexed. This is usefully illustrated in the Alexander Mosaic, King Alexander is shown thrusting with his xyston underarm, whilst immediately behind him a cavalryman is employing the overarm thrust. There {{is no evidence that}} the Macedonian cavalry ever used a two-handed grip on their lances, as did later Sarmatian and Roman lancers. The shaft of the xyston was tapered allowing the point of balance, and therefore the <b>hand</b> <b>grip,</b> to be approximately two thirds of the length of the spear away from the point. During the reign of Alexander the Great most cavalrymen did not carry shields. However, the Companion cavalry of the Antigonid dynasty did carry large, round bossed shields of Thracian origin.|$|E
500|$|On {{neurological}} examination, {{the weakness}} demonstrated with normal testing {{of power is}} often less severe than would be expected {{on the basis of}} the symptoms. Strength improves further with repeated testing, e.g. improvement of power on repeated <b>hand</b> <b>grip</b> (a phenomenon known as [...] "Lambert's sign"). At rest, reflexes are typically reduced; with muscle use, reflex strength increases. This is a characteristic feature of LEMS. The pupillary light reflex may be sluggish.|$|E

500|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey uses KUKA robocoaster technology, {{which allows}} the seats to pivot while being held above the track by a robotic arm. However, the ride is not a roller coaster but a scenic dark ride. The {{experience}} includes a flight around Hogwarts castle, an encounter with the Whomping Willow and a horde of Dementors, and a Quidditch match. The ride drops, spins around, twists and turns, but does not turn upside down, though passengers sometimes lie flat on their backs. Over-the-shoulder bars are used to secure guests in their seats, and a single parabolic metal bar [...] {{is used as a}} <b>hand</b> <b>grip.</b> At the conclusion of the ride, guests exit into Filch's Emporium of Confiscated Goods gift shop.|$|E

2500|$|The IEEE {{serves as}} a major {{publisher}} of scientific journals and organizer of conferences, workshops, and symposia (many of which have associated published proceedings).

2500|$|First, {{three of}} these terms are {{associated}} with sign ambiguities: the line integral [...] could go around the loop in either direction (clockwise or counterclockwise); the vector area [...] could point in {{either of the two}} directions normal to the surface; and [...] is the net current passing through the surface , meaning the current passing through in one direction, minus the current in the other direction—but either direction could be chosen as positive. These ambiguities are resolved by the right-hand rule: With the palm of the right-hand toward the area of integration, and the index-finger pointing along the direction of line-integration, the outstretched thumb points in the direction that must be chosen for the vector area [...] Also the current passing {{in the same direction as}} [...] must be counted as positive. The right <b>hand</b> <b>grip</b> rule can also be used to determine the signs.|$|E
60|$|The next {{instant the}} {{stranger}} felt the miner's <b>hand</b> <b>grip</b> his wrist. The struggle was {{now for the}} revolver. Each man strove to turn it against the other's body. The smoke in the hole was clearing. The stranger, lying on his back, was beginning to see dimly. But suddenly he was blinded {{by a handful of}} dirt deliberately flung into his eyes by his antagonist. In that moment of shock his grip on the revolver was broken. In the next moment he felt a smashing darkness descend upon his brain, {{and in the midst of}} the darkness even the darkness ceased.|$|E

Lerumie lifted his right hand in signal to a woman in a canoe alongside. She bent swiftly for something that she tossed to Lerumie. It was a long-handled tomahawk, the head of it an ordinary shingler's hatchet, the haft of it, native-made, a black and polished piece of hard wood, inlaid in rude designs with mother-of-pearl and wrapped with coconut sennit to make a <b>hand</b> <b>grip.</b> The blade of the hatchet had been ground to razor-edge.|$|E
