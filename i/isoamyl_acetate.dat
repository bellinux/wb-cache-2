25|$|C. maxillosus has {{abdominal}} defensive glands used to secrete {{a mixture}} of substances that act as an irritant to predators. These glands are located beneath the abdominal tergites. When threatened or disturbed, the beetle revolves its abdomen and touches abdominal tip to offender to wipe the glands. Ants (Formica exsectoides) are a common offender and have portrayed that this defense takes place. The ants are shown to be repelled by the four major components of secretion (<b>isoamyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> iridodial, E-8-oxocitronellyl acetate, and dihydroneptalactone). Dihydroneptalactone is the main principal ingredient of chemical defense.|$|E
40|$|Nonequilibrium, NVT, {{molecular}} dynamics (NEMD) simulations {{were used to}} obtain the shear viscosity, h, of <b>isoamyl</b> alcohol, n-butyl <b>acetate,</b> and their binary mixtures at 35 C and 0. 1 MPa. The fluids were modeled using rigid bonds, rigid bond angles, appropriate torsional potentials, pairwiseadditive Lennard-Jones dispersion interactions between united-atom sites, and partial point charges located at atomic centers. Simulations were performed at different shear rates,g, and values obtained at g = 0 are compared to experimental values. Two methods are commonly used to extrapolate purefluid simulated data to zero shear, h(0). The applicability of these two methods to mixtures of polar fluids was examined in this study. It was found that linear extrapolation with respect to g 1 / 2 can lead to ambiguous h(0) results for some mixtures because of a curvature in the data that shows no observably distinct change in rheology. On the other hand, a log-log plot of h(g) versus g is consistently very [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{suitable}} {{analytical procedure}} based on static headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by thermal desorption gas chromatography–ion trap mass spectrometry detection (GC–ITDMS), {{was developed and}} applied for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of volatile components of Portuguese Terras Madeirenses red wines. The headspace SPME method was optimised in terms of fibre coating, extraction time, and extraction temperature. The performance of three commercially available SPME fibres, viz. 100 lm polydimethylsiloxane; 85 lm polyacrylate, PA; and 50 / 30 lm divinylbenzene/carboxen on polydimethylsiloxane, was evaluated and compared. The highest amounts extracted, {{in terms of the}} maximum signal recorded for the total volatile composition, were obtained with a PA coating fibre at 308 C during an extraction time of 60 min with a constant stirring at 750 rpm, after saturation of the sample with NaCl (30 %, w/v). More than sixty volatile compounds, belonging to different biosynthetic pathways, have been identified, including fatty acid ethyl esters, higher alcohols, fatty acids, higher alcohol <b>acetates,</b> <b>isoamyl</b> esters, carbonyl compounds, and monoterpenols/C 13 -norisoprenoids...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbial}} {{diversity of the}} population grown on a selective medium for pseudomonads (cetrimide-fucidin-cephaloridine agar - CFC) and volatile organic compound (VOC) profile were determined during storage of gutted sea bream (Sparus aurata) at 2 degrees C. Microbiological and sensory changes were also monitored. Pseudomonas spp. were determined as the predominant spoilage microorganisms of gutted sea bream. A total of 104 colonies were collected from CFC plates and identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis at the following three time intervals: day 1, after four days of storage (day 5) and at the sensory rejection. point (day 9). Pseudomonas fluorescens was found as more abundant than the rest Pseudomonas species (Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas vranovensis), being the only bacterial species detected on CFC {{at the end of}} shelf life. VOCs such as 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol, 2 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 3 -methylbutanal, <b>isoamyl</b> butyrate, ethyl <b>acetate</b> and ethyl esters of propionate, butyrate and isobutyrate increased during storage and constitute potential chemical spoilage indices (CSIs) candidates for freshness/spoilage monitoring throughout storage.

2500|$|The aromas {{and flavor}} of rosés are {{primarily}} {{influenced by the}} particular grape varieties used to produce the wine but the method of production also plays an important part. The light, fruity character of many rosés come from volatile thiols that are found as flavor precursors in the grape skins. The most prominent of these is 3-mercaptohexanol-1-ol and 3-mercaptohenyl acetate. These are extracted from the grapes skin during maceration but {{are less likely to}} be extracted at temperatures before 20°C (68°F). So producers doing a [...] "cold soak" [...] maceration (with much lower temperature) to limit microbial and oxidative activity may extract less of these compounds. During fermentation, other flavor components such as the esters phenethyl acetate and <b>isoamyl</b> <b>acetate</b> also form and contribute to wine's aromas.|$|E
2500|$|Vertical and {{horizontal}} tasting involves {{a range of}} vintages within the same grape and vineyard, or the latter {{in which there is}} one vintage from multiple vineyards. [...] "Banana" [...] flavors (<b>isoamyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> are the product of yeast metabolism, as are spoilage aromas such as [...] "medicinal" [...] or [...] "Band-Aid" [...] (4-ethylphenol), [...] "spicy" [...] or [...] "smoky" [...] (4-ethylguaiacol), and rotten egg (hydrogen sulfide). Some varieties can also exhibit a mineral flavor due to the presence of water-soluble salts as a result of limestone's presence in the vineyard's soil. Wine aroma comes from volatile compounds released into the air. Vaporization of these compounds can be accelerated by twirling the wine glass or serving at room temperature. Many drinkers prefer to chill red wines that are already highly aromatic, like Chinon and Beaujolais.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{presence}} of oxygen several species of Candida and Pichia can create a film surface {{on top of the}} wine in the tank of barrel. Allowed to go unchecked, these yeasts can rapidly deplete the available free sulfur compounds that keeps a wine protected from oxidation and other microbial attack. The presence of these yeasts is often identified by elevated levels of volatile acidity, particularly acetic acid. Some strains of Pichia will metabolize acetic acid (as well as ethyl acetate and <b>isoamyl</b> <b>acetate</b> that may also be produced) with the side-effect of substantially decreasing the titratable acidity and shifting the pH of wine upwards to levels that make the wine prone to attack by other spoilage microbes. Commonly called [...] "film yeast", these yeasts are distinguished from the flor sherry yeast that are usually welcomed by winemakers in producing the delicate fino-style wines.|$|E

40|$|Samples of non-mature and añejo (matured) tequila of {{the same}} brand/provenance were {{analysed}} using GC–MS and gas chromatography olfactometry (GC-O) /aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) to provide quantitative data on the most odour active compounds {{that contribute to the}} aroma of these spirits. Extracts of non-mature tequila were characterized by 26 odour-active regions, which included ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, 2 -phenylethyl <b>acetate,</b> β-damascenone, <b>isoamyl</b> alcohol and octanoic acid as the most odour-active compounds (flavour dilution, FD, factor ≥ 6561). In contrast, extracts of the mature spirit showed 36 odour-active zones, where the compounds with the highest FD factors (6561) were ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, 2 -phenylethyl <b>acetate,</b> <b>isoamyl</b> alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, guaiacol, 4 -ethyl guaiacol, vanillin, cis/trans whisky lactones, β-damascenone and octanoic acid. The aromagram of mature tequila was thus differentiated from that of the non-mature spirit owing to the presence of cask-extractive compounds and the increased FD factors of certain terpenes, higher alcohols and acetals.

5000|$|There is {{a belief}} that {{artificial}} banana flavour tastes [...] "fake" [...] because {{it was intended to}} mimic the flavour of the 'Gros Michel' and not the Cavendish banana. This is due to the main chemical in banana flavoring being <b>isoamyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> the same chemical found in all bananas. <b>Isoamyl</b> <b>acetate</b> is popular due to it being a versatile and easy to work with compound. It is perceived to be closer in taste to a Gros Michel banana due to that strain having a higher concentration of that chemical and fewer [...] "volatile components" [...] that are found in other bananas. The Cavendish banana has a lot more complexity in its makeup, and therefore tastes less like pure <b>isoamyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Whether or not banana flavorings were purposely designed to taste more like Gros Michel is unknown.|$|E

50|$|Coenzyme A (CoA) and acetyl-CoA are two {{intermediate}} metabolites, {{most notably}} {{found in the}} Citric Acid Cycle, which participate in over 100 different reactions in the metabolism of microorganisms. Recent experiments have shown that over expression of the enzyme pantothenate kinase and supplementation of pantothenic acid in the CoA biosynthesis pathway have allowed adjustments of both CoA and acetyl-CoA fluxes. This increased concentration of cofactors resulted in an increased carbon flux in the <b>isoamyl</b> <b>acetate</b> synthesis pathway, increase the production efficiency of <b>isoamyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> <b>Isoamyl</b> <b>acetate</b> is used industrially for artificial flavoring and for testing the effectiveness of respirators. In addition {{to the production of}} <b>isoamyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> the manipulation of CoA biosynthesis during the pyruvate hydrogenase reaction also causes an increase in the production of both succinate and lycopene, each of which have beneficial effects on the human body. An increase in succinate concentration, which is used as a catalyst, may lead to an increase in the speed of the Citric Acid Cycle, and consequently an individual's metabolism. Increasing lycopene concentrations, has been shown to decrease the risk of prostate cancer.
