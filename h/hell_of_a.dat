25|$|Thompson's writing {{culminated in}} {{a few of his}} best-regarded works: The Killer Inside Me, Savage Night, A <b>Hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman and Pop. 1280. In these works, Thompson became one of the writers who turned the derided crime genre into {{literature}} and art, featuring unreliable narrators, odd structure, and quasi-surrealistic inner narratives of the last thoughts of his dying or dead characters. A number of Thompson's books became popular films, including The Getaway and The Grifters.|$|E

25|$|A <b>Hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman {{was also}} adapted in French as Série noire (1979) by Alain Corneau, with dialogues by French Oulipo writer Georges Pérec. This noir {{masterpiece}} {{set in the}} grim Paris outskirts features a 16-year-old Marie Trintignant's debut performance, {{as well as what}} is generally agreed to be Patrick Dewaere's finest performance. Dewaere conveys a tragic dimension to his manic portrayal of a mediocre door-to-door salesman, at one point repeatedly bashing his head against a car in an effort to exorcise his angst and guilt.|$|E
25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lot of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} I {{was part of}} what is now known as the {{emerging}} church and spent some time traveling the country to speak on the emerging church in the emerging culture on a team put together by Leadership Network called the Young Leader Network. But, I eventually had to distance myself from the emergent stream of the network because friends like Brian McLaren and Doug Pagitt began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to God as a chick, questioning God's sovereignty over and knowledge of the future, denial of the substitutionary atonement at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of hell which is one <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mistake.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{unreliable}} narrators {{often appear}} in detective novels and thrillers, where even a first-person narrator might hide essential information and deliberately mislead the reader {{in order to}} preserve the surprise ending. In some cases, the narrator describes himself or herself as doing things which seem questionable or discreditable, only to reveal in the end that such actions were not what they seemed (e.g. Alistair MacLean's The Golden Rendezvous and John Grisham's The Racketeer). Crime novelist Jim Thompson used the device of a narrator who is belatedly revealed to be psychotic and possibly delusional repeatedly in his books, most notably The Killer Inside Me, Savage Night, A <b>Hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman, and Pop. 1280.|$|E

25|$|In many {{religious}} cultures, including Christianity and Islam, Hell is often depicted as fiery, painful, and harsh, inflicting suffering on the guilty. Despite these common depictions <b>of</b> <b>Hell</b> as <b>a</b> place <b>of</b> fire, some other traditions portray Hell as cold. Buddhist - and particularly Tibetan Buddhist - descriptions <b>of</b> <b>hell</b> feature <b>an</b> equal number <b>of</b> {{hot and cold}} hells.
