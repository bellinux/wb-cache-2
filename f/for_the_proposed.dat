5|$|Activision {{introduced}} {{the game in}} May 2003, but in October, Valve experienced a security breach in which hackers stole the source code for Half-Life 2. The breach required new security implementations for the engine, delaying both games; the release of Bloodlines was postponed until early 2005. Until May 2004, Troika and Activision said that the game would feature a multiplayer component and modes including a team of vampires against a team of vampire hunters, {{with the ability to}} upgrade characters between each round. The team was left without a producer by Activision for over a year before David Mullich was assigned to the project. With no producer oversight, Mullich found the game's design incomplete, game levels created and abandoned, and several technical issues, including problems with code <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> multiplayer option. The Source multiplayer code was in its infancy, increasing its development time, and the idea was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Airborne Research Integrated Experiments System – ARIES, a NASA {{platform}} for air safety and operational research, {{was created in}} 1999 using the second production 757. The aircraft originally flew in the 757 flight test program before entering service with Eastern Air Lines. After NASA purchased the aircraft in 1994 to replace its 737-100 testbed, it was initially used to evaluate a hybrid laminar flow control system, avionics systems <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> Northrop YF-23 jet fighter, and the 777's fly-by-wire control system. Equipped with a flight deck research station, on-board laboratories, and two experimental flight decks, ARIES was used for evaluating weather information and landing approach systems, as well as runway friction tests. ARIES went into storage in 2006.|$|E

5|$|All {{of these}} factors have led to wide {{speculation}} {{that most of the}} 3.5million unsold copies of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ultimately wound up in this landfill, crushed and encased in concrete.

Writing for the Pacific Historical Review, John Wills speculated that location's place in the public psyche—its proximity to the sites of both the Trinity nuclear test and Roswell UFO incident—has aided the popularity of the story.|$|E
5|$|At {{a conference}} in September 1906, many of the {{disagreements}} over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor, von Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design. He also argued that guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) caliber would be sufficient to penetrate the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) caliber guns were necessary.|$|E
5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E

5|$|By mid-August 1942, Stanley had {{recovered}} {{enough to be}} moved to the dysentery wing at Block 151 of Roberts Barracks. Padres Chambers and Payne had heard that Stanley had decorated the prisoners' chapel at Bukit Batok. So they {{asked him if he}} would do some paintings for St Luke's Chapel, which was recently converted from the ground floor of Block 151, near the area where Stanley was recuperating. The Chapel was dedicated to St Luke the Physician. Stanley agreed, and sought inspiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> paintings in the Gospels.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{accounted}} for roughly 90 {{percent of the}} Manhattan Project's total cost. The day after Groves took over, he and Marshall took a train to Tennessee to inspect the site that Marshall had chosen <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> production plant at Oak Ridge. Groves was suitably impressed with the site, and steps were taken to condemn the land. Protests, legal appeals, and congressional inquiries were to no avail. By mid-November US Marshals were tacking notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.|$|E
5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, Christie {{was given}} command of Submarine Division 15, {{consisting}} of all six Salmon-class submarines. By 1941, Germany and the United Kingdom {{were engaged in}} the Battle of the Atlantic. Although the United States was neutral, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the U.S. Atlantic Fleet to enforce the Neutrality Patrol to assist UK-bound convoys. As part of secret agreements with Britain, the United States agreed to provide the former with submarines under Royal Navy control, should America enter the conflict. Admiral Richard S. Edwards, Commander, Submarines, Atlantic Fleet (ComSubLant), selected the now Captain Christie as tactical commander <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> submarine force in British waters. Christie wanted the new Tambor-class submarines to be assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, but was overruled by Admiral Harold R. Stark, who selected the older S and Barracuda classes instead. As war seemed increasingly likely {{toward the end of}} 1941, Christie placed his boats on full war footing.|$|E

Under this plan, the line was to connect to the IND Sixth Avenue and BMT Broadway Lines. As such, the line {{connecting}} to the IND Sixth Avenue Line is the IND 63rd Street Line, while the line connecting the BMT Broadway Line is the BMT 63rd Street Line.|$|E

Battalions of the French Foreign Legion and Laotian forces suffered losses covering the retreat of garrison survivors. The area of Muong Khoua later became a critical supply route across Dien Bien Phu for the Viet Minh and by 1963 was the site of a construction project <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> Route 19.|$|E
