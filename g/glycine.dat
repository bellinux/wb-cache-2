A three-year field study and complementary greenhouse experiment were conducted to determine the benefits of host-plant resistance (HPR) and pesticidal seed treatments for managing pest populations and preserving soybean yield. RESULTS: Host-plant resistance significantly decreased the abundance of A. <b>glycines</b> and, in most study sites, suppressed H. <b>glycines.</b> Neonicotinoid seed treatment reduced A. <b>glycines</b> abundance on the cultivar that was susceptible to both aphids and nematodes, but abamectin nematicide seed treatment {{had no effect on}} H. <b>glycines</b> populations in the field or greenhouse.

40|$|Background: The soybean cyst {{nematode}} Heterodera <b>glycines</b> {{is the most important}} parasite in soybean production worldwide. A comprehensive analysis of large-scale gene expression changes throughout the development of plant-parasitic nematodes has been lacking to date. Results: We report an extensive genomic analysis of H. <b>glycines,</b> beginning with the generation of 20, 100 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). In-depth analysis of these ESTs plus approximately 1, 900 previously published sequences predicted 6, 860 unique H. <b>glycines</b> genes and allowed a classification by function using InterProScan. Expression profiling of all 6, 860 genes throughout the H. <b>glycines</b> life cycle was undertaken using the Affymetrix Soybean Genome Array GeneChip. Our data sets and results represent a comprehensive resource for molecular studies of H. <b>glycines.</b> Demonstrating the power of this resource, we were able to address whether arrested development in the Caenorhabditis elegans dauer larva and the H. <b>glycines</b> infective second-stage juvenile (J 2) exhibits shared gene expression profiles. We determined that the gene expression profiles associated with the C. elegans dauer pathway are not uniformly conserved in H. <b>glycines</b> and that the expression profiles of genes for metabolic enzymes of C. elegans dauer larvae and H. <b>glycines</b> infective J 2 are dissimilar. Conclusion: Our results indicate that hallmark gene expression patterns and metabolism features are not shared in the developmentally arrested life stages of C. elegans and H. <b>glycines,</b> suggesting that developmental arrest in these two nematode species has undergone more divergent evolution than previously thought and pointing to the need for detailed genomic analyses of individual parasite species. ...|$|R

Several seed treatments labeled for H. <b>glycines</b> control are currently available, with more expected in the near future. This dissertation describes i) tools to study nematode chemotaxis to chemicals and roots and ii) assessment of two commercial seed treatments, ILeVO (active ingredient: fluopyram) and VOTiVO (active ingredient: Bacillus firmus I- 1582), on important H. <b>glycines</b> life processes. The first objective was to develop and test two novel microfluidic chips to study chemotaxis of plant-parasitic nematodes to chemicals (“basic chip”) and roots (“root chip”). Proof-of-concept experiments were conducted with both chips. Several ionic solutions were tested with the basic chip on second-stage juveniles (J 2 s) of H. <b>glycines</b> and the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita. There was a differential response of the two nematode species {{to a number of}} the ionic solutions. Custom software was written to assist in tracking nematodes in the root chip using a flatbed scanner. The attraction of H. <b>glycines</b> J 2 s to 3 -day-old soybean seedlings (cv. Williams 82) was successfully captured using the root chips over an 18 -hour period. The second objective was to assess the effects of ILeVO and VOTiVO seed treatments on several H. <b>glycines</b> life processes. In greenhouse experiments, ILeVO consistently reduced H. <b>glycines</b> reproduction on soybean roots. Seed exudates from ILeVO-treated seeds inhibited hatching and motility of H. <b>glycines</b> J 2 s, relative to the untreated control. Conversely, radicle exudates from seedlings grown from ILeVO-treated seeds reduced H. <b>glycines</b> hatching modestly in only one experimental run did not affect motility of J 2 s. In a growth chamber experiment, ILeVO significantly reduced H. <b>glycines</b> root penetration compared to untreated plants at two nematode inoculation levels. In another root penetration experiment, soybeans grown from treated or untreated seeds were inoculated with H. <b>glycines</b> J 2 s at soil depths of 2. 5, 5, or 7. 5 cm. ILeVO reduced nematode root penetration only at the 2. 5 -cm inoculation depth. Nematode behavioral changes in response to exudates from treated and untreated seeds then were assessed using custom software. ILeVO seed exudates significantly reduced speed of H. <b>glycines</b> J 2 s after two hours of exposure. A flatbed scanner then was used to study the movement of H. <b>glycines</b> populations exposed to seed treatments. Treated and untreated seeds were incubated in well plates for one hour before removal with clean forceps and insertion of H. <b>glycines</b> J 2 s. The percentage of the H. <b>glycines</b> populations that moved over a critical threshold distance (300 μm) in the wells were evaluated every hour for 24 hours using another custom software program. ILeVO significantly reduced population movement relative to the untreated control. And H. <b>glycines</b> J 2 s in wells that had a seed, treated or not, had significantly less movement compared with the blank control. Overall, the results suggest that ILeVO affects multiple life processes of H. <b>glycines.</b> VOTiVO did not consistently affect any of the variables measured in the experiments...|$|R
