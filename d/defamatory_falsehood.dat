Relatively soon after the article was published, Wales wrote to WorldNetDaily to object to this characterization: [...] "This is absolutely and categoricallly [...] false. I have never made any 'fortune', as a pornography trafficker or otherwise, and I have never been a 'pornography trafficker' at all. ... I demand an immediate edit to that story to remove the lie about me." [...] WorldNetDaily editor Joseph Farah personally replied to Wales to explain that Wikipedia's coverage {{of the history of}} Bomis acknowledged at the time that: [...] "Bomis ran a website called Bomis Premium at premium.bomis.com until 2005, offering customers access to premium, X-rated pornographic content." [...] Wales sent an email to Farah stating Wikipedia: [...] "doesn't say anything remotely like me making a 'fortune' from 'pornography." [...] Wales inquired to Farah {{what he was going to}} do next about what Wales characterized as [...] "libel". Farah responded to Wales' reply with a subsequent email asking: [...] "Let me get this straight: You admit making money from pornography, but you feel defamed because you didn’t make enough for it to be considered a 'fortune'?" [...] Wales then repeated his original request to Farah and again asserted the original article was [...] "defamatory", writing in an email: [...] "This is a <b>defamatory</b> <b>falsehood.</b> I have never made any 'fortune' as a 'porngraphy [...] trafficker.'

That month, Trump's attorney, Marc Kasowitz, sent Warner Books a letter which demanded a {{complete}} recall of the book's copies, {{as well as}} a public correction and an apology. Kasowitz wrote: [...] "This book ... contains out-and-out <b>defamatory</b> <b>falsehoods</b> concerning Mr. Trump, his business and his family.

40|$|This {{monograph}} {{derives from}} a Society of the Cincinnati Address-Lecture given at Hampden-Sydney College, Virginia. The monograph examines {{the reasons for}} the charges of seditious libel against John Peter Zenger for publishing the New York Weekly Journal (newspaper) in 1733 and attacking various corruptive polices being pursued by William Cosley, the Colonial Governor of the Provinces of New York and New Jersey. The subsequent trial of Zenger for his journalistic criticisms of the Governor, his acquittal, and his defense by Alexander Hamilton, established the historical significance then, as today, that liberty of conscience and freedom of thought are central to a democracy and, thus, to a free press. Libel is only actionable when <b>defamatory</b> <b>falsehoods</b> are proved; and truth is always a valid defense to an action for defamation...|$|R

The recreation area {{had been used}} primarily as a ski resort. The column in question had criticized the fiscal management of the area by Baer, stating [...] "What happened to all the money last year? and every other year?" [...] Between the trial and an appeal brought by petitioner, the Court had decided New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, in which they held that a State cannot award damages to a public official for a <b>defamatory</b> <b>falsehood</b> relating to official conduct unless the official can show actual malice. The New Hampshire Supreme Court had affirmed the award in the original case.|$|E

40|$|On March 9, 1964, in The New York Times Company v. Sullivan, the United States Supreme Court {{gave its}} {{sanction}} to {{a rule that}} prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a <b>defamatory</b> <b>falsehood</b> relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with 2 ̆ 2 actual malice 2 ̆ 2 - that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not. This doctrine has governed virtually all subsequent decisions in libel cases. The Sullivan ruling {{has been seen as}} introducing new principles into the field; it has been denounced as providing 2 ̆ 2 virtually a license to lie 2 ̆ 2; and it called forth a promise of corrective legislation from President Nixon. Nonetheless, the issue in Sullivan, the standards by which it was resolved, and the resolution itself all have considerable precedent in cases from nineteenth century America. This paper will seek to explore some of those precedents. It will try to focus as narrowly as possible on the question: what was the law in America between 1825 and 1896 with respect to civil actions brought by public figures to recover for the written publication of defamatory falsehoods? As background, however, we shall begin by defining a few key terms and glancing at some major developments in this area between 1787 and 1825...|$|E
40|$|Corporations have {{increasingly}} used defamation suits as an offensive weapon. Many of these suits {{may be defined}} as SLAPP suits-Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation. These suits, often meritless, are designed to harass and silence a corporations 2 ̆ 7 critics. Following a survey oft he history of defamation law {{and the protection of}} free speech, this Note argues that corporations should be treated as per se public figures in defamation suits. This derives from the uniquely public nature of a corporation and an assumption of the risk of <b>defamatory</b> <b>falsehoods</b> that arises from the act of incorporation. Treating corporations in this manner would place a heavier burden on corporations by requiring a showing of actual malice in their defamation claims. This Note concludes that such a requirement would provide a better balance between corporations 2 ̆ 7 defamation concerns and their opponents 2 ̆ 7 free speech rights...|$|R
40|$|Since its beginning, {{the actual}} malice test first {{announced}} in 1964 in New York Times v. Sullivan, {{has suffered from}} problems that are increasingly traceable to {{the changing face of}} journalism. Its demand that the mind of the reporter be proved 2 ̆ 2 with convincing clarity 2 ̆ 2 has adverse consequences for plaintiffs and news organizations alike. End runs around the subjective state of mind inquiry by plaintiffs have become more common. And the actual malice test 2 ̆ 7 s predictability, its capacity as a standard of liability to yield consistent and coherent results across a body of cases, remains a hollow promise. As Robert Sack famously put it, successful libel plaintiffs 2 ̆ 2 resemble the remnants of an army platoon caught in an enemy crossfire. 2 ̆ 2 Perhaps the central flaw in the subjective malice/recklessness test is its focus on individual rather than corporate conduct, a shortcoming so fundamental that, in our judgment, the test should be supplemented, in the press setting at least, with what we call an institutional reckless disregard standard. This would be a largely objective assessment of the corporate decisions that affect journalism when they manifest knowing indifference to the risk of <b>defamatory</b> <b>falsehood</b> that flow from the decisions. Why would such a standard be preferable? First, the actual malice/reckless disregard standard focuses on the state of mind of a reporter or editor instead of on the underlying factors that can give rise to defamatory publication, and over which writers and editors may have little or no control. Second, the actual malice/reckless disregard standard is blunt-edged. Third, while libel actions may be traumatic for journalists, the shift of financial liability to the business as a whole insulates journalists from responsibility for knowing and false misbehavior, thus in effect making them more indifferent to the risks their behavior imposes on others. Fourth, by exacting punishment based on conduct of journalists, not on organizational recklessness, the actual malice/recklessness inquiry frees news organizations to adopt risky practices without fear of consequences. At a time when market-based forces are placing great financial pressure on newsrooms and the publicly traded organizations that own most of them, a rule that frees journalistically dangerous corporate decisions from cost or consequence is likely, perversely, to facilitate the very choices that the law should discourage. For these reasons we propose a different method of liability for news organizations, one that rests liability on corporate decisions that are known to present a heightened risk of falsity and defamation because of the impact of such decisions on staffing, training, editorial oversight, copyediting and related factors that affect the reliability of the news product and that cannot be justified on grounds related to the quality or journalistic performance of the news organization. We believe that decisions that are knowingly, indeed often calculatedly, taken to increase profits or personal wealth at the cost of slipshod journalism should not be relieved, as they are now, from consideration in establishing liabilit...|$|E
