500|$|Bulgaria {{adopted the}} Kyoto Protocol and {{achieved}} the protocol's objectives by reducing {{carbon dioxide emissions}} from 1990 to 2009 by 30 percent. However, pollution from factories and metallurgy works and severe deforestation continue to cause major problems {{to the health and}} welfare of the population. In 2013, air pollution in Bulgaria was more severe than any other European country. Urban areas are particularly affected by energy production from coal-based powerplants and automobile traffic, while pesticide usage in the agriculture and antiquated industrial sewage systems produce extensive soil and water pollution with chemicals and detergents. Bulgaria is home to Maritsa Iztok-2, a lignite-fired power station causing the <b>highest</b> <b>damage</b> costs to health and the environment in the entire European Union according to the European Environment Agency. It is the only EU member which does not recycle municipal waste, although an electronic waste recycling plant opened in June 2010. The situation has improved in recent years, and several government-funded programs have been put into place in an attempt to reduce pollution levels. According to Yale University's 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Bulgaria is a [...] "modest performer" [...] in protecting the environment. Over 75% of surface rivers meet the standards for good quality. An improvement of water quality began in 1998 and has maintained a sustainable trend of moderate improvement.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{success story}} {{can be found}} in an academia {{innovation}} partnership formed with the University of Miami’s Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS). The concept of using CSTARS was to determine how well access to a constellation of unclassified commercial satellites could support traditional Southern Command missions. Initial demonstrations were conducted with promising results. Subsequent letters of endorsements and demand signals for future use of CSTARS were published and promulgated to various centers of excellence and a funding mechanism was established within Southern Command. Within a year of the initial CSTARS demonstrations, hurricanes ravaged Haiti in 2008 and Southern Command responded with assistance, including an impromptu emergency redeployment of USS Kearsarge from its previously scheduled mission. Assessment of inland damage caused by the hurricanes was a critical need to the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts, and CSTARS provided vital imagery to those operations to quickly determine areas of <b>highest</b> <b>damage</b> and evaluation of inland infrastructure. Unclassified CSTARS imagery and information were then rapidly broadcast and distributed to both DOD and interagency responders via unclassified email. This response was only possible due to the groundwork laid during the initial CSTARS demonstration and a long-term vision for follow-on support made possible by CSTARS to Southern Command.|$|E

The strain signal editing process was performed by removing low amplitude cycles were eliminated based on the cut-off level of the signal energy distribution in the time representation. Thus, the new edited signal was obtained which has retained almost 100 % of the original fatigue damage and has equivalent signal statistic. The original and edited strain signals were analysed for predicting the fatigue damage of the coil spring. A comparison study of the fatigue damage and the <b>highest</b> <b>damage</b> zone obtained from the original strain signal and the edited strain signal carried out. From the result obtained, the prediction of the fatigue damage and the <b>highest</b> <b>damage</b> zone for both strain signals original and edited is equivalents.

40|$|Pests of {{star fruit}} in Blitar District, East Java. Pest attack causes the {{production}} of star fruit decreases. This study aim was to identify the pests of star fruit in Blitar District which could provide an information about pest species, damage symptoms and damage intensity. The research was conducted during August – September 2014 in Gogodeso, Karangsonoand Pojok Villages at Blitar District, East Java. Observations of the pests ware done by determining the four locations of plantation on each villages randomly. Three plants sample were choosen in each plantation location diagonally. Each plant was divided into four quadrant according to wind directions. One branch in the bottom was choosen in each quadrant. Nine species were recorded as pests of starfruit in Blitar district. Pest was identified on the leaf was Pteroma plagiophleps, on the branch was Zeuzera coffeae, on the flower were Toxoptera aurantii and Maconellicoccus hirsutus, whereas those on the fruit were Toxoptera aurantii, Maconellicoccus hirsutus, Thrips javanicus, Helopeltis bradyi, Cryptophlebia leucotreta, Bactrocera dorsalis, and Bactrocera carambolae. The population density of M. hirsutus was higher in Karangsono than in other villages.

40|$|Shifting {{successful}} plaintiffs' fees to defendants {{and increasing}} damage awards are alternative ways to achieve similar results: increasing plaintiffs' incentives to sue and raising defendants' expected payments.
