2500|$|According to witnesses, the {{shooting}} occurred {{shortly after the}} limousine made the sharp left-hand turn from Houston onto Elm Street. Most of the witnesses recalled that the first shot was fired after the president had started waving with his right hand. The onlookers recalled hearing three shots, with {{the second and third}} shots bunched distinctly much closer together than the first and second shots. [...] The Zapruder film shows the President re-emerging in the footage after being temporarily hidden from view by the Stemmons Freeway sign at Zapruder film frame 224 to 225; his mouth has already opened wide in an anguished expression. He has already been impacted by a bullet and his hands clench <b>into</b> <b>fists.</b> He then quickly raises his fists dramatically {{in front of his face}} and throat as he turns leftwards towards his wife. Secret Service Agent Clint Hill testified that he heard one shot, then jumped off the running board of the Secret Service follow-up car directly behind Kennedy (Hill was filmed jumping off his follow-up car at the equivalent of Zapruder frame 308; about a quarter of a second before the president's head exploded at frame 313). Hill then rapidly ran towards the Presidential limo and then another shot hit Kennedy in the head, cracking open the right side of his skull. As the limousine began speeding up, Mrs. Kennedy was heard to scream [...] and she climbed out of the back seat onto the rear of the limo. [...] At the same time, Hill managed to climb aboard and hang onto the suddenly accelerating limo, and Mrs. Kennedy returned to the back seat. Hill then shielded her and the President. Both of the Connallys stated they heard Mrs. Kennedy say, [...] "I have his brains in my hand!" [...] The limo driver and police motorcycles turned on their sirens and raced at high speeds to Parkland Hospital, passing their intended destination of the Dallas Trade Mart along the way, and arriving at about 12:38p.m. (CST).|$|E
60|$|Again Mr. Pike {{nodded his}} head and agreed, and I noted his two big paws, relaxed the moment before and {{drooping}} over the rail, quite unconsciously tensed and folded themselves <b>into</b> <b>fists.</b> Also, I noted fresh abrasions on the knuckles.

Therefore, though with a look she would have crushed the insolent, and her delicate hands were clenched <b>into</b> <b>fists</b> that would have chastised him then and there if they had the strength, she returned his look of fierce defiance with her usual one of calm.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} element of closed or open posture of the body are the hands. Showing the palms of the hands can be a signal of open posture, especially if the hand is relaxed. Showing {{the back of the}} hand or clenching hands <b>into</b> <b>fists</b> may represent a closed posture. Hands clasped behind the back may also signal closed posture even though the front is exposed because it can give the impression of hiding something or resistance to closer contact.|$|E

Additionally, he can summon short, cat-like Adamantium claws from his knuckles by balling his hands <b>into</b> <b>fists.</b> T'Chaka becomes outraged upon learning that S.H.I.E.L.D.

50|$|This is {{sometimes}} referred to as the startle reaction, startle response, startle reflex or embrace reflex. It is more commonly known as the Moro response or Moro reflex after its discoverer, pediatrician Ernst Moro. The Moro reflex is present at birth, peaks in the first month of life, and begins to disappear around 2 months of age. It is likely to occur if the infant's head suddenly shifts position, the temperature changes abruptly, or they are startled by a sudden noise. The legs and head extend while the arms jerk up and out with the palms up and thumbs flexed. Shortly afterward the arms are brought together and the hands clench <b>into</b> <b>fists,</b> and the infant cries loudly. The reflex normally disappears by three to four months of age, though it may last up to six months. Bilateral absence of the reflex may be linked to damage to the infant's central nervous system, while a unilateral absence could mean an injury due to birth trauma (e.g., a fractured clavicle or injury to the brachial plexus). Erb's palsy or some other form of paralysis is also sometimes present in such cases. In human evolutionary history, the Moro reflex may have helped infants cling to the mother while being carried around. If the infant lost its balance, the reflex caused the infant to embrace its mother and regain its hold on the mother's body.|$|E

40|$|Babies {{are born}} with limited {{abilities}} to move around the world or to manipulate objects in it. They wave their arms and legs, and they curl their hands <b>into</b> <b>fists</b> when their palms are touched. But they cannot find their way anywhere, or use any of the astonishing number of tools invented by their forebears. How does this situation change? How do infants become adults who can navigate through unfamiliar territory and who can not only use but invent tools? Why will some infants become adults who are exceptionally skilled at these activities, while other infants will grow into the sort of adults who constantly get lost, or who put together a bookshelf backwards—the {{kind of people who}} refer to themselves deprecatingly as “not good with maps” or “not a do-it-yourself person”? And how can we maximize the spatial skills of the population to help meet the demands of a technological society, both for people who are fascinated by spatial challenges and wish to augment their abilities, and for those who are the future klutzes? These seemingly simple questions disguise a territory of much greater complexity, characterized by substantial disagreement and fractionation. To take outright disagreement first, considerable debate has centered on the nature of normative development. Do infants develop into competent adults in a protracted course of development propelled by interactions with th...|$|E
