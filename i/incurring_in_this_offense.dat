50|$|The Sutherland single-wing {{differs from}} the {{traditional}} single-wing in that the wingback is brought into the backfield as a halfback, flanking the fullback {{on the other side}} from the tailback. This allows a more flexible running attack to the weak-side. Both the tailback and halfback are triple threats <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>offense.</b> The weakness of this formation is less power than the traditional single-wing and it requires very talented backs to play tailback and halfback effectively.|$|R

50|$|Another {{offense is}} the 1-3-2, which is {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} 2-3-1 flipped upside down. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>offense,</b> there is one midfielder {{at the top of}} the field, two midfielders on the wings and an attackmen on the crease, and two attackmen below the goal line. <b>This</b> <b>offense</b> is designed to allow the attackmen more opportunities to drive from below the goal, and allows the top midfielder a very open field to drive to the goal.Another, less commonly used offense is the 2-2-2. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>offense</b> there are two midfielders at the top left and top right corners, a midfielder and attackmen on the crease, and two attackmen on the bottom right and bottom left corners. <b>This</b> <b>offense</b> resembles an X. This is a very complicated offense, and is quite rare even at the college level. It is designed to allow the crease players to set picks and cut, as in the 1-4-1, as well as allow players to drive from the corners. When properly implemented, it is very difficult to defend. If an individual defender is beaten on a drive, another defender must come from the crease, leaving a player open close to the goal, or from a corner, in which case it may not arrive in time. It is very difficult for the offense, as offensive player must routinely make long passes between the corners, and must all be able to handle the ball competently, as they cannot make a short outlet pass if they get into trouble.|$|R
50|$|Another {{aspect of}} the West Coast offense {{is the use of}} fast running quarterbacks. In blitz or short-yardage situations, many of the West Coast offense's {{strengths}} are negated by defenses blocking running and passing lanes. A running quarterback can compensate by acting as a runner himself, paralyzing an overly aggressive defense. Quarterbacks such as Randall Cunningham and Michael Vick have been successful runners <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>offense,</b> as well as other notable scrambling quarterbacks such as Jake Plummer, Donovan McNabb, Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson and Colin Kaepernick.|$|R

50|$|Another factor <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>offense</b> is the {{inclusion}} of the no huddle. The QB and the offense race up to the line of scrimmage, diagnose what the defense is showing, and then snap the ball based on the QB's play call. This not only allows a team to come back if they are down a lot as seen in the 2006 Insight Bowl but it also allows them to tire out the defense and allow for bigger runs and bigger pass completions. The fast pace limits the defense's ability to substitute players and adjust their scheme. The hurried pace can cause defensive mental mistakes such as missed assignments or being out of position.|$|R
50|$|One {{important}} aspect is the split of the offensive linemen. Normally they are bunched together but <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>offense,</b> {{they are often}} split apart about a half to a full yard from another. While this allows easier blitz lanes in theory, it forces the defensive ends and defensive tackles to have to run further to reach the quarterback for a sack. The quick, short passes are then able to offset any Blitz that may come. Another advantage is that by forcing the defensive line to widen, it opens up more wide open passing lanes for the QB {{to throw the ball}} through without fear of having their pass knocked down or intercepted.|$|R
