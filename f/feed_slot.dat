40|$|Coating on a {{substrate}} with a slot-die forms alternate {{wet and dry}} stripes as {{the substrate}} speed is increased when the upstream pressure equals the downstream pressure. The coating thickness is thus nonuniform across {{the width of the}} substrate. Applying vacuum upstream of the <b>feed</b> <b>slot</b> allows uniform coating at higher speeds.

40|$|Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) {{film casting}} {{involves}} melt flow through a slot die, across a small span, {{and onto a}} fast moving quench drum. In the ""wire-pinning"" casting process, a thin electrified wire close {{to the line of}} contact with the drum creates a strong pinning force that delays air entrainment to higher line speeds. Nonuniform wetting of the die lips by the extruded melt is thought to be responsible for the formation of streaks, a defect in the machine direction. A finite element model of the film casting process with wire pinning was developed to assist in understanding what causes significant wetting of the lips and whether this can be avoided by electrostatic pinning. The solution of the governing equations provide the location of the static and dynamic contact lines, thus finding the wetting and pinning points in the process. The simulations investigate the sensitivity of the static wetting line locations on the die lands to the imposed values of static contact angle and die-lip gap. It was found that while the contact angle has a small effect on the extent of die-lip wetting within the parameter ranges examined, there is a considerable chance that the <b>feed</b> <b>slot</b> surfaces can be dewetted. This seems to be the greatest danger for causing streaks rather than excessive wetting of the die lands. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers...|$|E
40|$|Coating tensioned-web {{running over}} slot die is an {{efficient}} way of depositing thin and uniform layers on flexible web {{at high speed}} with a relatively simple set-up, a combination of slot die premetering and carefully controlled web transport. A particularly attractive feature of such tensioned-web coating is that two layers can be coated simultaneously, which {{makes it possible for}} one of the layers to be exceptionally thin, and for two layers to be created with less wastage than in tandem single layer operation. Successful two-layer coating from a two-slot die requires not only avoiding bead break-up, but also operating at conditions that fix the separation line of the interlayer zone at a proper position, which is generally the downstream corner of the mid-lip between the two feed slots; otherwise the layer becomes non-uniform [Cohen 1993, Sartor 1998] and microvortexes may be prompted in the coating bead. Whereas one-dimensional elastoviscocapillary modeling accounts well for the web profile over the die, the gap between web and die lips, and the pressure profile along the gap, full two-dimensional Navier-Stokes theory is necessary to predict separation line location on the mid-lip and occurrence of microvortexes around the feed slots and downstream meniscus.

In tensioned-web-over-slot die (TWOSD) coating, web is sustained {{only by the}} ten- sion of the web wrapped around the coating die. The distance between the die and web is set by {{the interaction between the}} hydrodynamic force of coating liquid and the normal stress resultant from the curved tensioned web, in what is called elaso- hydrodynamic interaction. In order to analyze this particular the coating flow, several tools are developed and tested on other coating flows relatively simpler than TWOSD flow. The theoretical conditions for the onset of vortex that degrades product qualities are proposed and the critical vortex birth trajectories inside the parameter space are tracked automatically by a direct tracking method. To detect a defect-causing flow feature in multi-layer coating, mid-gap invasion, the position of an interlayer separation point was tracked by theoretical model. The results are verified by flow visualization experiment for two- layer fixed-gap slot coating. Also linear stability analysis was performed, in order to detect unstable interlayer that signals coating defects in the two-layer slot coating. The purpose of the research is to understand the complicated flow characteristic inside the coating bead by solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes theory using finite element method and visualizing the coating bead flow on a lab-scale TWOSD coater. Using the tools described above, the flow features that leads to coating defects, such as, bead breakup, weeping, mid-gap invasion and <b>feed</b> <b>slot</b> vortex, are identified and mathematical forms of the onset condition for the features are presented.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. November 2008. Major: Chemical engineering. Advisors: L. E. Scriven, M. S. Carvalho. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 252 pages, appendix 2 A. Includes bibliographical references and (some col. illustrations). Coating tensioned-web running over slot die is an efficient way of depositing thin and uniform layers on flexible web {{at high speed}} with a relatively simple set-up, a combination of slot die pre-metering and carefully controlled web transport. It is different from conventional slot die coating, where the coating gap is maintained by the clearance between backup roll and slot die, in that coating gap is maintained by elastohydrodynamic balance between the tension-resultant force of the curved and tensioned web and the pressure in the coating bead; with this setup much thinner coating gap is made than is possible in conventional slot die coating. For successful operation in tensioned-web coating system, properly designed die is necessary. In conventional slot die coating, pressure profile in the coating bead is well understood and efficiently predicted by considerations based on the one-dimensional viscocapillary model. The model to describe the pressure and gap profiles in tensioned-web slot die coating needs to incorporate {{the interaction between the}} liquid flow and the web deformation, leading to a nonlinear system of equations. In this thesis, coating bead flows and gap profiles in both single-layer and two-layer tensioned-web slot die coating were studied by theoretical model based on shell theory and lubrication approximation, hybridized with two-dimensional flow model when two-dimensional flow model is necessary, and visualization using bench-top web transport system with slot die mounted. The results from visualization and theoretical model study show that a tensioned-web slot die coating die {{can be viewed as a}} combination of component foil bearings. Interpreting the results in this manner, it is easier to predict how the change in die shape and process condition will affect the pressure and gap profiles and therefore easier to design the die shapes required to achieve desired process states, as thin and fast coating, stable two layer coating, or to predict and remove the appearance of microvortexes. By the two-dimensional model on the flow of the two-layer coating, positioning of separation line and appearance of the microvortexes inside the <b>feed</b> <b>slot</b> were studied with the changes in operation condition...|$|E

50|$|To {{meet the}} requirements, {{it had to}} be {{considered}} that a long smoothbore barrel was best for the new rifle to fire underwater, but a rifled barrel was necessary to gain any significant range while above water. To solve this problem and get a true 'hybrid' design, the rifle would have to fire two types of projectile, one underwater, and another above water. The rifle was designed with two <b>feed</b> <b>slots,</b> able to accept two magazines at the same time, to make the transition seamless. Professor Danilov designed the ASM-DT to fire both 5.45 x 39 mm 7N6 (a version of the standard Soviet ammunition), adapted to the caliber of the ASM-DT, and also 5.45 x 39 mm MGTS, underwater ammunition like that of the existing APS. The ASM-DT uses the same magazines as the APS while under water, and AK-74 magazines above water. The magazine release shifts forward when using AK-74 magazines, and the gas system automatically adjusts for firing out of water. To enable accurate shooting when outside of water, the barrel is rifled, however it has shallow grooves running along its length, which expel some gases ahead of the bullet and blow any water out of the barrel. This prevents the barrel from bursting if the rifle should need to be taken to the surface quickly, and fired outside of water without being drained first. In addition, the rifle can be equipped with a GP-25 grenade launcher, a bayonet, or a PBS sound and flash suppressor.|$|R
