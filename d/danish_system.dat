30|$|As aforementioned, the <b>Danish</b> power <b>system</b> {{is used to}} {{validate}} {{the performance of the}} rolling balance and the AGC. The <b>Danish</b> power <b>system</b> is composed of Eastern and Western <b>Danish</b> power <b>systems,</b> which are synchronously connected to the Nordic and Continental European (CE) synchronous power systems, respectively [8]. To study the active power balance control in the <b>Danish</b> power <b>system,</b> it requires a detailed dynamic representation of the power system that includes conventional power plants, WPPs and interconnection with neighbouring power systems. The system interconnections and the aggregated power plants models, developed in power factory, are explained below.|$|R

50|$|Many {{countries}} {{tried to}} subsidize green technology such as wind power, and most {{failed to make}} a viable industry. The <b>Danish</b> <b>system</b> was an exception, providing 30% of initial capital cost {{in the early years}} which was gradually reduced to zero, but still maintaining a feed-in tariff. The capital cost subsidy was reduced to 20% in June 1985, when wind turbines received DKK 50 million per year. Other renewable energy forms received 37 million. The research institution Teknologisk Institut identified many specific improvement needs, pushing development from ad hoc to systemized solutions.|$|E

The high wind penetration scenarios for the <b>Danish</b> power <b>system</b> by 2020 are used to assess the performance of the methodology through a set of simulations with the developed <b>Danish</b> power <b>system</b> model.

The integration of the <b>Danish</b> financial <b>system</b> {{with that of the}} Euro area is tested using - among different approaches - The law of one price. Finally, the framework {{for the development of the}} financial system is compared. It is concluded that the <b>Danish</b> financial <b>system</b> has many common characteristics with that of the Euro area countries. Despite the similarities there is some way to go before exactly the same retail products are marketed within all countries in the Euro area and in Denmark.
