50|$|The public house, The White Horse, a 16th or 17th century {{building}} with many later extensions, constructed {{from the local}} Bargate stone, a local term for the <b>hard</b> <b>masonry</b> material which {{is a type of}} limestone with traces of greensand.|$|E
60|$|At {{the next}} corner {{we saw a}} deep {{indention}} in the <b>hard</b> stone <b>masonry</b> {{of the corner of}} a house, but might have gone heedlessly by it but that the guide said it was made by the elbow of the Saviour, who stumbled here and fell. Presently we came to just such another indention in a stone wall. The guide said the Saviour fell here, also, and made this depression with his elbow.|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time, the {{characterisation}} and the ceramic properties of thirty clays from southern Tuscany are discussed {{on the basis}} of their particle size distribution, Atterberg limits, geochemical (XRF) and mineralogical (XRD) composition and microfossils content. Very little information was available for the Albegna Basin, therefore, sampling included all outcroppings of Neogene-Quaternary clays. The results allowed the distinction of Miocene, Pleistocene and Holocene Ca-poor clays, suitable for the production of red stonewares and dense and frost resistant masonry materials, from Pliocene Ca-rich clays, used for the production not only of red earthenware but also of <b>hard</b> and porous <b>masonry</b> material...|$|R
