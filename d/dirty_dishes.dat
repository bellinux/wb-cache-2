5|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find their living styles are {{increasingly}} clashing. Jim is slovenly, leaving <b>dirty</b> <b>dishes</b> {{to soak in}} the sink until someone else washes them, while Darryl is so fastidious about his possessions that he puts labels with his name on all of them, even a bag of flour. When Darryl takes issue with Jim using his labeled coffee mug, the two begin bickering. Eventually the two come to understand each other's habits better, and relieve tension by playing a video game together.|$|E
25|$|Houses, {{cars and}} {{businesses}} were abandoned by those evacuating. Some locked their front doors, some did not, reasoning {{that someone would}} break the door to get in anyway. Some gave away pets, others just released them, many put them down. Some gave away furniture and belongings, some gave it to someone for safe storage, others simply walked away, leaving <b>dirty</b> <b>dishes</b> {{in the sink and}} food on the table. The withdrawal of cash from banks was limited to £20 per person. People could take just one suitcase.|$|E

6000|$|She {{released}} him and looked around. A lot of <b>dirty</b> <b>dishes</b> {{were on the}} table, the tablecloth was a [...] "sight to behold," [...] {{and so was the}} stove-kettle marks all over the tablecloth, splotches of pancake batter all over the stove.|$|E
60|$|Water was heated, {{and it did}} {{not take}} long to dispose of the <b>dirty</b> <b>dishes.</b> While the three boys were doing this, the others cleaned up {{the living room of the}} bungalow, and also {{straightened}} out their beds. From time to time all gazed out of the small-paned windows, to see that the snow was coming down as thickly as ever.|$|E
6000|$|In Schoenstrom he {{had known}} that there must somewhere be {{beautiful}} [...] "parlors," [...] but he had trusted in his experience of kitchens. Kitchens, according to his philosophy, were small smelly rooms of bare floors, and provided with one oilcloth-covered table, one stove (the front draft always broken and propped up with the lid-lifter), one cupboard with panes of tin pierced in rosettes, and one stack of <b>dirty</b> <b>dishes.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{track is}} driven by a drum machine and is a mostly synth-based ballad. Lyrically, Lennox sings of {{mustering}} the power to leave a destructive relationship with a lover who does not return the affection she deserves ("...a woman's just too tired to think / about the <b>dirty</b> old <b>dishes</b> in the kitchen sink").|$|R
60|$|Though eight o'clock, it {{was still}} dark outside, and the cabin was lighted by a tallow candle thrust into an empty whisky bottle. It stood on the pine-board table {{in the middle of a}} disarray of <b>dirty</b> tin <b>dishes.</b> Tallow from innumerable candles had dripped down the long neck of the bottle and {{hardened}} into a miniature glacier. The small room, which composed the entire cabin, was as badly littered as the table; while at one end, against the wall, were two bunks, one above the other, with the blankets turned down just as the two men had crawled out in the morning.|$|R
50|$|In the 1940s, Thor {{introduced}} the Automagic hybrid washer/dishwasher. The top-loading machine included both a removable clothes washing drum and a dish-washing drum. The Automagic was widely marketed but {{disappeared from the}} marketplace soon after its introduction, as many consumers soured {{to the idea of}} washing <b>dirty</b> clothing and <b>dishes</b> in the same machine.|$|R
60|$|Hendricks {{pushed the}} pack to her. She took a {{cigarette}} and passed the pack to the two soldiers. In {{the corner of the}} small room the lamp gleamed fitfully. The room was low-ceilinged, cramped. The four of them sat around a small wood table. A few <b>dirty</b> <b>dishes</b> were stacked to one side. Behind a ragged curtain a second room was partly visible. Hendricks saw the corner of a cot, some blankets, clothes hung on a hook.|$|E
60|$|The {{coming of}} night {{made all of}} those at home anxious {{for the return of}} the two young hunters. Feeling that both would be {{thoroughly}} hungry, Mrs. Morris had cooked a liberal supper, of which after waiting an hour, those in the cabin had eaten their share. The remainder now simmered in the pot and kettle hung over the big open fire, while Mrs. Morris moved uneasily about, clearing away the <b>dirty</b> <b>dishes</b> and occasionally glancing out of the doorway in the direction she fancied they must come.|$|E
60|$|So hand in hand, {{and each}} with a candle in the other hand, {{like a pair of}} young penitents, they {{continued}} their explorations with more purpose than before. The kitchen, into which they penetrated, had clearly been much used of late, for there were <b>dirty</b> <b>dishes</b> scattered about, and the fire had been lighted, though it was now out. In one corner was {{what seemed to be a}} pile of drab-coloured curtains. In the other, an armchair lay upon its side with legs projecting. A singular disorder, very alien to Mrs. Watson's habits, pervaded the apartment. A dresser with a cupboard over it claimed the first attention of the hungry pair. With a cheer from Frank and hand- clapping from Maude, they brought out a new loaf of bread, some butter, some cheese, a tin of cocoa, and a bowl full of eggs. Maude tied an apron over her pretty russet dress, seized some sticks and paper, and had a fire crackling in a very few minutes.|$|E
60|$|In every cabin {{they visited}} that night {{they found a}} similar situation. Scurvy had smitten the whole camp. A dozen women were in the party, though the two men did not see all of them. Originally there had been ninety-three men and women. But ten had died, and two had {{recently}} disappeared. Smoke told of finding the two, and expressed surprise that none had gone that short distance down the trail {{to find out for}} themselves. What particularly struck him and Shorty was the helplessness of these people. Their cabins were littered and <b>dirty.</b> The <b>dishes</b> stood unwashed on the rough plank tables. There was no mutual aid. A cabin's troubles were its own troubles, and already they had ceased from the exertion of burying their dead.|$|R
5000|$|Individual campsites {{are marked}} by a wooden sign nailed to a tree which {{indicates}} the campsite number. Signs should not be touched by anyone, to preserve them. Camps have a metal fire ring, which {{may be used for}} small fires unless a fire ban is in place, which is often the case, given Philmont's dry climate. A bucket/ pail of water must always be readily available in the case that the fire grows out of control. There is also a sump, an L-shaped plastic pipe, with a partly exposed two-foot vertical section and a ten-foot perforated horizontal section underground. The exposed pipe is capped with a piece of mesh. [...] Sumps are used to dispose <b>dirty</b> dishwater. <b>Dishes</b> and pots must stay around the sump to not attract bears.|$|R
50|$|La Dolce Viva {{takes place}} mostly in Warhol's new loft studio {{which has been}} named 'The Factory', which was full of his helpers and hangers-on. Some parts of the {{interview}} took place in Viva's East 83rd Street brownstone floor-through apartment which is scattered with the mixture of clean and <b>dirty</b> clothes, underwear, <b>dishes</b> in the sink, food {{on the counter and}} stacks of old magazines and papers. Along with Andy Warhol's apartment and Viva's apartment, La Dolce Viva also takes place in Max's Kansas City, a restaurant where the models, actresses, and Warhol were treated like celebrities.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a small}} room, scantily furnished, {{with the}} same marks of neglect and decay which met us at every turn. The walls were hung with {{discoloured}} tapestry, which had come loose at one corner, so as to expose the rough stonework behind. A second door, hung with a curtain, faced us upon the other side. Between lay a square table, strewn with <b>dirty</b> <b>dishes</b> and the sordid remains of a meal. Several bottles were scattered over it. At the head of it, and facing us, there sat a huge man with a lion-like head and a great shock of orange-coloured hair. His beard was of the same glaring hue; matted and tangled and coarse as a horse's mane. I have seen some strange faces in my time, but never one more brutal than that, with its small, vicious, blue eyes, its white, crumpled cheeks, and the thick, hanging lip which protruded over his monstrous beard. His head swayed about on his shoulders, {{and he looked at}} us with the vague, dim gaze of a drunken man. Yet he was not so drunk but that our uniforms carried their message to him.|$|E
6000|$|The fog still hung {{upon the}} distant bay and hid the {{opposite}} point. But {{the sun shone}} with dry Californian brilliancy over the league-long field around him, revealing {{every detail of the}} rancho with sharp, matter of fact directness, and without the least illusion of distance or romance. The rough, unplaned, unpainted walls of the dinner-shed stood out clearly before him; the half-filled buckets of water on the near platform, and the immense tubs piled with <b>dirty</b> <b>dishes.</b> He scowled darkly as he walked forward, conscious, nevertheless, of the invigorating discipline of the morning air and the wholesome whip in the sky above him. He entered sharply and aggressively. To his relief, the room at first sight seemed, like the dormitory he had just left, to be empty. But a voice, clear, dry, direct, and practical as the morning itself, spoke in his ear: [...] "Mornin', Reddy! My daughter says you're willin' to take an indoor job, and I reckon, speakin' square, as man to man, it's more in your line than what you've bin doin'. It mayn't be high-toned work, but work's WORK anyhow you can fix it; and the only difference I kin see is in the work that a man does squarely, and the work that he shirks." ...|$|E

6000|$|By the {{beginning}} of March 1694, Pignerol had been bombarded by the enemies of France; presently Louis XIV. had to cede it to Savoy. The prisoners there must be removed. Mattioli, in Pignerol, {{at the end of}} 1693, had been in trouble. He and his valet had tried to smuggle out letters written on the linings of their pockets. These were seized and burned. On March 20, 1694, Barbezieux wrote to Laprade, now commanding at Pignerol, that he must take his three prisoners, one by one, with all secrecy, to Sainte-Marguerite. Laprade alone must give them their food on the journey. The military officer of the escort was warned to ask no questions. Already (February 26, 1694) Barbezieux had informed Saint-Mars that these prisoners were coming. 'They are of more consequence, one of them at least, than the prisoners on the island, and must be put in the safest places.' The 'one' is doubtless Mattioli. In 1681 Louvois had thought Dauger and La Riviere more important than Mattioli, who, in March 1694, came from Pignerol to Sainte- Marguerite. Now in April 1694 a prisoner died at the island, a prisoner who, like Mattioli, HAD A VALET. We hear of no other prisoner on the island, except Mattioli, who had a valet. A letter of Saint-Mars (January 6, 1696) proves that no prisoner THEN had a valet, for each prisoner collected his own <b>dirty</b> plates and <b>dishes,</b> piled them up, and handed them to the lieutenant ...|$|R

50|$|Lily {{has a plan}} {{to remind}} the couple of their four biggest arguments: <b>dirty</b> <b>dishes,</b> the {{presence}} of Barney's ex-girlfriends, whether Stormtroopers are cool, and a Canadian-American war. She contacts Robin's friend, Alan Thicke, to meet the couple at their usual diner, along with one of Barney's insane one-night stands, Meg (April Bowlby), a passing actor dressed as a Stormtrooper, and a busboy (Vincent Piazza) carrying <b>dirty</b> <b>dishes.</b> The gang stakes out the location in a rented station wagon. Marshall is annoyed at Ted for being too cheap to rent a proper stake-out van. Thicke and Meg arrive and apparently know each other. Lily {{was unable to find}} a Stormtrooper and instead finds a man dressed as the robot from Lost in Space, as she thinks Stormtroopers are also robots. As they argue over the station wagon and a pizza delivery, Barney and Robin look right in their direction. Ted and Marshall think their cover is blown, but Lily executes the plan anyway.|$|E
