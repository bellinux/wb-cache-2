40|$|Abstract—Whole-body shocks and {{vibrations}} experienced dur-ing manual wheelchair use can decrease an individual’s comfort, {{increase the}} rate of fatigue, result in injury, and consequently limit mobility and community participation. We used a wheelchair-vibration simulator to examine whether the seat reaction forces experienced by wheelchair users were differentially influenced by wheelchair suspension, trunk-muscle innervations, and ground speed. We used wheelchairs instrumented with load cells and accelerometers to determine the forces transmitted from the seat frame and the <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> experienced by riders. We deter-mined that self-selected speed, seat force, and <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> differed between subjects with and without trunk-muscle innerva-tions and between rigid and suspension wheelchairs. Seat force and <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> were greatest in the rigid-frame wheel-chair and lowest in the spring-type suspension-frame wheel...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} modeling {{study is}} conducted to investigate neck coupling in helmeted head impacts. The main {{objective of the}} study is to provide direction for the experimental reconstruction of American football player impacts. Head responses are compared in MADYMO simulations of various impact scenarios without neck coupling, with an improved human neck model, and with a Hybrid-III neck model. The human neck model is a continued development of an existing neck model, with improved multi-directional biofidelity. Also the helmet model has substantial effect on the interpretation of the simulation results, and a model of an American football helmet is developed. In the simulated impact scenarios, linear <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> show limited change as a result of neck coupling, but angular <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> change drastically depending on whether or not a neck is included in the model. Effects of body mass on <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> are limited for the impact conditions simulated in this study. This study shows that neck coupling should be accounted for if head linear and angular accelerations obtained from accident reconstructions are to be used to establish human tolerance...|$|E
40|$|Slipping and {{tripping}} {{contribute to}} {{a large number of}} falls and fall-related injuries. While the vestibular system is known to contribute to balance and fall prevention, it is unclear whether it contributes to detecting slip or trip onset. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of slipping and tripping on <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> during walking. This information would help determine whether individuals with vestibular dysfunction are likely to be at a greater risk of falls due to slipping or tripping, and would inform the potential development of assistive devices providing augmented sensory feedback for vestibular dysfunction. Twelve young men were exposed to an unexpected slip or trip. <b>Head</b> <b>acceleration</b> was measured and transformed to an approximate location of the vestibular system. Peak linear acceleration in anterior, posterior, rightward, leftward, superior, and inferior directions were compared between slipping, tripping, and walking. Compared to walking, peak accelerations were up to 4. 68 m/s 2 higher after slipping, and up to 10. 64 m/s 2 higher after tripping. <b>Head</b> <b>acceleration</b> first deviated from walking 100 - 150 ms after slip onset and 0 - 50 ms after trip onset. The temporal characteristics of <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> support a possible contribution of the vestibular system to detecting trip onset, but not slip onset. <b>Head</b> <b>acceleration</b> after slipping and tripping also appeared to be sufficiently large to contribute to the balance recovery response...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} was to {{demonstrate}} the potential for a fully adaptive restraint system to significantly reduce injuries. To accomplish this, a three-bodied model of a 50 th percentile Anthropometric Test Dummy (ATD) in a 35 mph frontal collision was made using Lagrangian Dynamics. The model was verified against test data obtained from NHTSA. Viscoelastic and constant force seatbelt models were created, and the results were compared for a 1998 Chevy Malibu. The simulation accurately reproduced the shape and magnitude of pelvis, chest, and <b>head</b> <b>accelerations.</b> The constant force seatbelt reduced pelvis, chest, and <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> by 56 %, 62 %, and 63 %, respectively. The peak lap belt force was reduced by 60 %. Relative head rotation was reduced by 16 degrees. A simple control concept was explored and demonstrated the feasibility of an adaptive constant force restraint system. Such restraint systems can make large reductions to risk of injury by significantly reducing forces and accelerations on the occupant...|$|E
40|$|Oppositely {{directed}} displacements of {{the head}} need oppositely directed vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VOR), i. e. compensatory responses. Ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMPs) mainly reflect the synchronous extraocular muscle activity {{involved in the process}} of generating the VOR. The oVEMPs recorded beneath the eyes when looking up represent electro-myographic responses mainly of the inferior oblique muscle. We aimed: (1) to study the properties of these responses as they were produced by head acceleration impulses to the forehead and to the back {{of the head}}; (2) to investigate the relationships between these responses and the 3 -D linear <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> that might reflect the true stimulus that acts on the vestibular hair cells. We produced backward- and forward-directed acceleration stimuli in four conditions (positive and negative head acceleration impulses to the hairline and to the inion) in 16 normal subjects. The oVEMPs produced by backward- and forward-directed accelerations of the head showed consistent differences. They were opposite in the phase. The responses produced by backward accelerations of the head began with an initial negativity, n 11; conversely, those produced by accelerations directed forward showed initially a positive response, p 11. There was a high inter-subject correlation of <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> along the head anteroposterior and transverse axes, but almost no correlation of accelerations along the vertical axis of the head. We concluded that backward-directed <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> produced an initial excitatory response, and forward-directed accelerations of the head were accompanied by an initial inhibitory response. These responses showed dependence on acceleration direction in the horizontal plane of the head. This could be consistent with activation of the utricle...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the common}} {{knowledge}} about an evident tendency of females {{to walk with}} more style and poise than males, gender differences in walking mechanics have received little attention. Upper body oscillations during level walking are person specific and in able bodied individuals are characterised by an attenuation of the linear acceleration progressing from pelvis level up to head level. The manner of controlling <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> in the anatomical planes has recently been covered in the literature, but gender differences have been rarely investigated. This study aims to asses {{the existence of these}} differences. Two groups of young healthy volunteers (20 males, 23 +/- 2 y. o., and 20 females, 23 +/- 3 y. o.) were asked to walk along a linear pathway and upper body accelerations were directly measured using wearable inertial sensors located along the cranio-caudal axis at pelvis, shoulder, and head levels. Both groups managed to attenuate the antero-posterior accelerations, although the females exhibited a more effective shoulder to head attenuation. Group differences were found in the medio-lateral direction: not only were the males unable to attenuate the accelerations progressing from pelvis to shoulder levels to the same extent as the females, but <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> were even larger than those at the shoulder level. The females' ability to implement a more effective attenuation, possibly indicating a better control strategy, allowed them to reach <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> equivalent to those of the males despite higher pelvis accelerations. Although an explanation for these gender differences calls for further investigations, they should always be considered when upper body kinematics is used for clinical assessment...|$|E

40|$|Quadrupedal mammals {{typically}} synchronize their respiration {{with body}} movements during rhythmic locomotion. In the rat, fast respiration is coupled to head movements during sniffing behavior, but whether respiration is entrained by stride dynamics is not known. We recorded intranasal pressure, <b>head</b> <b>acceleration,</b> instantaneous speed, and ultrasonic vocalizations from {{male and female}} adult rats while freely behaving in a social environment. We used high-speed video recordings of stride to understand how <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> signals relate to locomotion and developed techniques to identify episodes of sniffing, walking, trotting, and galloping from the recorded variables. Quantitative analysis of synchrony between respiration and <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> rhythms revealed that respiration and locomotion movements were coordinated but with a weaker coupling than expected from previous work in other mammals. We have recently shown that rats behaving in social settings produce high rates of ultrasonic vocalizations during locomotion bouts. Accordingly, rats emitted vocalizations in {{over half of the}} respiratory cycles during fast displacements. We present evidence suggesting that emission of these calls disrupts the entrainment of respiration by stride. The coupling between these two variables is thus flexible, such that it can be overridden by other behavioral demands...|$|R
40|$|The biomechanical {{responses}} of human head (translational head CG accelerations, rotational <b>head</b> <b>accelerations,</b> and HIC) under lateral impact to the parietal-temporal region were investigated {{in the current}} study. Free drop tests were conducted at impact velocities ranging from 2. 44 to 7. 70 m/s with a 40 durometer, a 90 durometer flat padding, and a 90 durometer cylinder. Specimens were isolated from PMHS subjects {{at the level of}} occipital condyles, and the intracranial substance was replaced with brain simulant (Sylgard 527). Three tri-axial accelerometers were instrumented at the anterior, posterior, and vertex of the specimen, and a pyramid nine accelerometer package (pNAP) was used at the contra-lateral site. Biomechanical responses were computed by transforming accelerations measured at each location to the head CG. The results indicated significant “hoop effect” from skull deformation. Translational head CG accelerations were accurately measured by transforming the pNAP, the vertex accelerations, or the average of anterior/posterior acceleration to the CG. The material stiffness and structural rigidity of the padding changed the biomechanical {{responses of}} the head with stiffer padding resulting in higher <b>head</b> <b>accelerations.</b> At the skull fracture, HIC values were more than 2 – 3 x higher than the frontal skull fracture threshold (HIC= 1000), emphasizing the differences between frontal and lateral impact. Rotational <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> up to 42. 1 krad/s 2 were observed before skull fracture, indicating possible severe brain injury without skull fracture in lateral head impact.

The injury potential posed by the resulting <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> in the context of demining, has not been previously studied. Instrumented anthropomorphic surrogates were used to evaluate the protective capabilities of various types of helmet systems employed in demining, for a range of mine threats, as defined by the explosive content.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to utilize an in-helmet system that measures and records linear <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> to analyze head impacts from collegiate football. The Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System is an in-helmet system with six spring mounted accelerometers and an antenna that transmits data via radio frequency to a sideline receiver and laptop computer system. The data reported by the HIT System includes the time of impact, location of impact, and linear acceleration resultant of the head center of gravity. The algorithm and in-helmet application for this system were validated in five series of tests. In particular, the validation emphasized that the HIT System measurements are of the player’s head and not helmet accelerations as evidenced by the helmet acceleration being 16. 6 (± 3. 2) times greater than the peak <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> measured by the HIT System and dummy cg accelerometers.

Twenty eight volunteers underwent rear impacts with <b>head</b> and chest <b>acceleration</b> data collected. The same apparatus was used to test 11 cervico-thoracic human cadaveric spines with an instrumented headform attached. <b>Head</b> <b>acceleration,</b> individual vertebral kinematics from high speed video, local nerve root pressure, and facet joint contact pressures were collected during impacts. Each specimen was tested first at an impact acceleration similar to that of volunteers, who reported minimal or no symptoms after the test, then at double the <b>acceleration.</b> <b>Head</b> X (forward) and Z (upward) accelerations of cadaveric specimens were very similar in time sequence and magnitude to those of unprepared volunteers.

40|$|Primary blast induced {{traumatic}} brain injury (bTBI) is a prevalent battlefield injury in recent conflicts, yet biomechanical mechanisms of bTBI remain unclear. Elucidating specific biomechanical mechanisms is essential to developing animal models for testing candidate therapies and for improving protective equipment. Three hypothetical mechanisms of primary bTBI have received the most attention. Because translational and rotational <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> are primary contributors to TBI from non-penetrating blunt force head trauma, the acceleration hypothesis suggests that blast-induced <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> may cause bTBI. The hypothesis of direct cranial transmission suggests that a pressure transient traverses the skull into the brain and directly injures brain tissue. The thoracic hypothesis of bTBI suggests that some combination of a pressure transient reaching the brain via the thorax and a vagally mediated reflex result in bTBI. These three mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive, and quantifying exposure thresholds (for blasts of a given duration) is essential for determining which mechanisms may be contributing for a level of blast exposure. Progress has been hindered by experimental designs which do not effectively expose animal models to a single mechanism and by over-reliance on poorly validated computational models. The path forward should be predictive validation of computational models by quantitative confirmation with blast experiments in animal models, human cadavers, and biofidelic human surrogates over a range of relevant blast magnitudes and durations coupled with experimental designs which isolate a single injury mechanism...|$|E

Simulations were carried out using a computer model of an anthropomorphic testing device within a child safety seat subjected to various aggressive driving conditions, a frontal impact, and a side impact.

40|$|Background The {{forefoot}} running footfall {{pattern has}} been suggested {{to reduce the risk}} of developing running related overuse injuries due to a reduction of impact related variables compared with the rearfoot running footfall pattern. However, only time-domain impact variables have been compared between footfall patterns. The frequency content of the impact shock and the degree to which it is attenuated may be of greater importance for injury risk and prevention than time-domain variables. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the differences in <b>head</b> and tibial <b>acceleration</b> signal power and shock attenuation between rearfoot and forefoot running. Methods Nineteen habitual rearfoot runners and 19 habitual forefoot runners ran on a treadmill at 3. 5 m/s using their preferred footfall patterns while tibial and <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> data were collected. The magnitude of the first and second <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> peaks, and peak positive tibial acceleration were calculated. The power spectral density of each signal was calculated to transform the <b>head</b> and tibial <b>accelerations</b> in the frequency domain. Shock attenuation was calculated by a transfer function of the head signal relative to the tibia. Results Peak positive tibial acceleration and signal power in the lower and higher ranges were significantly greater during rearfoot than forefoot running (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). The first and second <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> peaks and <b>head</b> signal power were not statistically different between patterns (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). Rearfoot running resulted in significantly greater shock attenuation for the lower and higher frequency ranges as a result of greater tibial acceleration (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Conclusion The difference in impact shock frequency content between footfall patterns suggests that the primary mechanisms for attenuation may differ. The relationship between shock attenuation mechanisms and injury is not clear but given the differences in impact frequency content, neither footfall pattern may be more beneficial for injury, rather the type of injury sustained may vary with footfall pattern preference...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. We have {{investigated}} lower limb responses in seven blindfolded healthy subjects to well controlled tilts in the standing position. Our aims were (1) {{to determine the}} effect of <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> magnitude on responses evoked by whole head-and-body tilts, and (2) to establish whether tilt-evoked responses are modifiable by passive ankle dorsiflexion. Whole head-and-body tilts evoked responses in the biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles. Methods. Seven young healthy subjects stood on a spring-activated tilting apparatus and underwent sudden whole head-and-body tilts of about 15 ° from the vertical position, with or without passive ankle dorsiflexion. <b>Head</b> <b>acceleration</b> was recorded with a linear accelerometer and ankle angular displacement with a potentiometer. Surface EMG signals were recorded in the right biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles. Results. As the peak of <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> was increased from 0. 5 g to 1. 8 g, the frequency of occurrence of tilt-evoked responses increased from 7 % to 60 % of trials in the biceps femoris muscle during whole head-and-body tilts. In general, the more proximal muscle (biceps femoris) was activated before the more distal muscle (medial gastrocnemius) during whole head-and-body tilts, while the opposite pattern was found during tilt with dorsiflexion. Conclusions. Our results indicate that the occurrence of tilt-evoked responses increases with an increase in the amplitude of tilting acceleration. This suggests that tilt-evoked responses are dependent, at least in part, on vestibular stimulation. In addition, the spatio-temporal pattern of biceps femoris and medial gastrocnemius muscle activation was opposite during whole head-and-body tilts and tilts with dorsiflexion. This finding suggests that foot/ankle somatosensory inputs can modify tilt-evoked responses. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R

40|$|To better {{understand}} the risk and safety of heading a soccer ball, the author created a set of simple mathematical models based upon Newton’s second law of motion to describe the physics of heading. These models describe the player, the ball, the flight of the ball before impact, {{the motion of the}} head and ball during impact, and the effects of all of these upon the intensity and the duration of acceleration of the head. The calculated <b>head</b> <b>accelerations</b> were compared to those during presumably safe daily activities of jumping, dancing, and head nodding and also were related to established criteria for serious head injury from the motor vehicle crash literature. The results suggest heading is usually safe but occasionally dangerous, depending on key characteristics of both the player and the ball. Safety is greatly improved when players head the ball with greater effective body mass, which is determined by a player’s size, strength, and technique. Smaller youth players, because of their lesser body mass, are more at risk of potentially dangerous headers than are adults, even when using current youth size balls. Lower ball inflation pressure reduces risk of dangerous <b>head</b> <b>accelerations.</b> Lower pressure balls also have greater “touch” and “playability”, measured in terms of contact time and contact area between foot and ball during a kick. Focus on teaching proper technique, the re-design of age-appropriate balls for young players with reduced weight and inflation pressure, and avoidance of head contact with fast, rising balls kicked at close range can substantially reduce risk of subtle brain injury in players who head soccer balls...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an {{integrated}} vehicle semi-active suspension control system {{that includes a}} full-car suspension model (7 Degree-Of-Freedom (DOF)), a seat suspension model (2 DOF) and a driver body model (4 DOF) is developed. A H static output feedback controller which only uses measurable variables as feedback signals is designed to improve vehicle ride comfort performance in terms of driver <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> under constraints of actuator saturation, suspension deflection limitation and road holding capability. The controller design conditions, which are expressed as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) are derived by dealing with each control input separately under a common Lyapunov function, so that a feasible solution can be found for the integrated high order system that has five control inputs and ten control outputs; each control input may require different feedback signals and have different saturation limitations. Furthermore, a semiactive control strategy is applied to implement the proposed control system using electrorheological (ER) dampers. Numerical simulations are {{used to evaluate the}} improvement of ride comfort performance in terms of driver <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> responses under typical road disturbances...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{the study of}} robust active control of an integrated vehicle suspension system that consists of chassis suspension, seat suspension, and driver body models. This integrated system has five control inputs and ten control outputs and each control input may require different feedback signals and have different saturation limits. Taking the measurement available variables as feedback signals, an H∞ static output feedback controller is designed to improve vehicle ride comfort performance in terms of driver <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> under the constraints of actuator saturation, suspension deflection limitation, and road holding capability. The parameter uncertainties to the driver body are considered in the controller design procedure. The controller design conditions, which are expressed as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), are derived by dealing with each control input separately under a common Lyapunov function so that a feasible solution can be found. Furthermore, force tracking control strategy is applied to implement the proposed control system using electrohydraulic actuators. The improvement of ride comfort is evaluated by using numerical simulations on the driver <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> responses under a typical road disturbance...|$|R
40|$|A {{viscoelastic}} rod model {{which includes}} damping {{has been used}} to simulate the spinal column mathematically. This one-dimensional rod was subjected to a ramp input acceleration and the theoretical acceleration {{at the end of the}} rod was compared to the experimental <b>head</b> <b>acceleration</b> data from previously conducted cadaver tests. The agreement between the experimental and theoretical results is better than for the elastic rod model previously published, but indicates further nonlinear considerations are still needed...|$|R
