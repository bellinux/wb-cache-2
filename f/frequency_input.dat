Frequency synthesizers are used in many modern devices such as radio receivers, televisions, mobile telephones, radiotelephones, walkie-talkies, CB radios, cable television converter boxes [...] satellite receivers, and GPS systems. A {{frequency synthesizer}} may use the techniques of frequency multiplication, frequency division, direct digital synthesis, frequency mixing, and phase-locked loops to generate its frequencies. The stability and accuracy of the frequency synthesizer's output {{are related to the}} stability and accuracy of its reference <b>frequency</b> <b>input.</b> Consequently, synthesizers use stable and accurate reference frequencies, such as those provided by crystal oscillators.|$|E

50|$|Product {{detectors}} can {{be designed}} to accept either IF or RF <b>frequency</b> <b>inputs.</b> A product detector which accepts an IF signal would {{be used as a}} demodulator block in a superheterodyne receiver, and a detector designed for RF can be combined with an RF amplifier and a low-pass filter into a direct-conversion receiver.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{stabilize}} the output power, the amplification of the input RF signal is automatically controlled by PIN diodes [...] If {{the frequency of the}} output signal were to be set equal to the frequency of the input RF signal, the output RF would feed back from the output antenna to the input antenna and the input stage would overload, completely blocking out the translator. Because of this, the translator output frequency must be different from the input signal <b>frequency.</b> <b>Input</b> and output band-pass filters further isolate the two signals.|$|E
5000|$|The earlier {{estimate}} {{showed that}} the cascode output resistance is very large. The implication is that many load resistances will not satisfy the condition RL >> Rout (an important exception is driving a MOSFET as the load, which has infinite low <b>frequency</b> <b>input</b> impedance). However, the failure to satisfy the condition RL >> Rout is not catastrophic because the cascode gain also is very large. If the designer is willing, the large gain can be sacrificed to allow a low load resistance; for RL << Rout the gain simplifies as follows: ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{stability}} of sinusoidal responses of interpolative sigma delta modulators (SDMs) is investigated. It is found that interpolative SDMs may switch from unstable to stable behaviors {{even though the}} magnitude or the <b>frequency</b> of the <b>input</b> sinusoidal signals increase.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} filter configured {{to provide}} phase lead without accompanying gain distortion is analyzed and evaluated. The nonlinear filter {{is superior to}} a linear lead/lag compensator {{in its ability to}} maintain system stability as open loop crossover frequency is increased. Test subjects subjectively rated the filter as slightly better than a lead/lag compensator in its ability to compensate for delays in a compensatory tracking task. However, the filter does introduce unwanted harmonics. This is particularly noticeable for low <b>frequency</b> pilot <b>inputs.</b> A revised compensation method is proposed which allows such low <b>frequency</b> <b>inputs</b> to bypass the nonlinear filter. A brief analytical and experimental evaluation of the revised filter indicates that further evaluation in more realistic tasks is justified...|$|R
5000|$|Oscillator sync is {{a feature}} in some synthesizers {{with two or}} more VCOs, DCOs, or [...] "virtual" [...] {{oscillator}}s. One oscillator will restart the period of another oscillator, {{so that they will}} have the same base frequency. This can produce a musical sound, rich with harmonics. The timbre can be altered on the synched oscillator by varying its <b>frequency</b> <b>input.</b> A synched oscillator that resets the other oscillator(s) is called the master, and any synched oscillator that is reset by another oscillator is called a slave. There are two common forms of oscillator sync which appear on synthesizers: Hard Sync and Soft Sync. Soft Sync is a term used for a variety of mechanisms. Other sync mechanisms exist which are also discussed. According to Sound on Sound journalist Gordon Reid, oscillator sync is the least understood feature for many users of a synthesizer.|$|E
5000|$|Intermodulation {{distortion}} (IMD) : Distortion {{that is not}} harmonically {{related to}} the signal being amplified is intermodulation distortion. It {{is a measure of}} the level of spurious signals resulting from unwanted combination of different <b>frequency</b> <b>input</b> signals. This effect results from non-linearities in the system. Sufficiently high levels of negative feedback can reduce this effect in an amplifier. Many believe it is better to design electronics in a way to minimize feedback levels, though this is difficult to achieve while meeting other high accuracy requirements. Intermodulation in loudspeaker drivers is, as with harmonic distortion, almost always larger than in most electronics. IMD increases with cone excursion. Reducing a driver's bandwidth directly reduces IMD. This is achieved by splitting the desired frequency range into separate bands and employing separate drivers for each band of frequencies, and feeding them through a crossover filter network. Steep slope crossover filters are most effective at IMD reduction, but may be too expensive to implement using high-current components and may introduce ringing distortion. Intermodulation distortion in multi-driver loudspeakers can be greatly reduced with the use of active crossover, though it significantly increases system cost and complexity.|$|E
30|$|It is {{apparent}} that the amplitude must be set smaller for a higher <b>frequency</b> <b>input</b> {{in order to maintain}} the constant acceleration stress, and it becomes smaller than 1 cm at a frequency higher than 5 Hz. Since the resulting kinematic solutions tend to be buried under the thermal noise, the frequency response was evaluated through a frequency of up to 5 Hz. Moreover, the jerk stress becomes higher for a higher <b>frequency</b> <b>input.</b> Recall the earlier discussion on the steady-state error for the PLL. Since the jerk value of the maximum 5 -Hz input signal frequency is still smaller than the peak jerk stress obtained from Eq. (4), the PLL should work properly without losing carrier phase tracking under the signal dynamics defined in Table 2.|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} {{non-invasive}} way of measuring high <b>frequency</b> <b>input</b> impedance in infants which enables airway wall mechanics to be studied in vivo during normal tidal breathing. The establishing forced oscillation technique and the novel high speed interrupter technique were used to measure high <b>frequency</b> <b>input</b> impedance in infants. After the technical development and validation of the techniques, the variability and reproducibility of the measurements were determined to be similar to other lung function techniques for this age group. Using both techniques, high <b>frequency</b> <b>input</b> impedance showed particular features, the so called anti-resonant frequencies. Similar to human adults, in these infants anti-resonances are also related to wave propagation phenomena but not to tissue properties. Measurements during bronchial challenge with methacholine showed that airway wall compliance crucially determines the wave propagation velocity in the infants airways.;In order to determine whether airway wall mechanics are different in infants with wheezing disorders, high frequency Zin was examined in wheezing infants in comparison to healthy infants. Infants with wheezing disorders had lower anti-resonant frequencies even when they were asymptomatic, indicating in airway wall mechanics. Such structural changes may be due to developmental differences, differences in airway smooth muscle function or may be induced by airway inflammation and airway remodelling...|$|E
