30|$|Consider the {{scenario}} in Figure 3 again. Suppose node B has to forward a packet. Node B has nodes D and E in its <b>forwarder</b> set, but the energy level of node E {{is lower than}} node B. If the energy level of the <b>forwarder</b> is lower by a certain threshold than the sender, the sender excludes the node from the <b>forwarder</b> set temporarily.

40|$|The {{contract}} between the carrier and <b>forwarder</b> {{is a long-term}} issue, and the repeated contract business makes the <b>forwarder</b> develop a reference point based on the contract prices, and this reference effect, to a large extent, affects the <b>forwarder’s</b> contract purchasing decisions. Based on that, this paper introduces the reference effect in the sea-cargo supply chain and studies a multiple-period contract problem between the carrier and the <b>forwarder.</b> It is found that when the capacity price in the spot market {{is less than the}} <b>forwarder’s</b> willingness-to-pay, the <b>forwarder’s</b> contract purchasing decision is not affected by the reference effect, only by the capacity price in the spot market, and the multiple-period contract problem can be simplified into a single-period game. In addition, the carrier’s optimal contract wholesale price approaches the capacity price in the spot market. Although, the <b>forwarder’s</b> contract purchasing decision depends upon the reference effect, it is difficult to derive the closed-form solution. Moreover, because of the risk in the spot market, the carrier tends to sell his/her capacity in the contract market. Finally, we employ the numerical simulation to study the carrier’s contract pricing decisions and the <b>forwarder’s</b> capacity purchasing decisions in two cases...|$|R

In this paper, we focus on selecting and prioritizing <b>forwarder</b> list to minimize energy consumption by all nodes. We study both cases where the transmission power of each node is fixed or dynamically adjustable. We present an energy-efficient opportunistic routing strategy, denoted as EEOR.

40|$|Abstract—Opportunistic routing [1], [2] {{was shown}} to improve the network {{throughput}} greatly. The core idea is to allow any node in the <b>forwarder</b> list, which overhears the transmission and {{is closer to the}} destination to participate in forwarding the packet. The nodes in <b>forwarder</b> list is prioritized and the lower priority <b>forwarder</b> will discard the packet if the packet has been forwarded by a higher priority <b>forwarder.</b> One open problem is how to select and prioritize <b>forwarder</b> list efficiently. In the paper, we investigate how to select and prioritize <b>forwarder</b> list to minimize energy consumptions. We study the case where the transmission power of each node is fixed (known as non-adjustable transmission model) as well as the case where each node is able to adjust its transmission power for each transmission (known as adjustable transmission model). Energy optimum algorithms to select and prioritize <b>forwarder</b> list in both cases are presented and analyzed. Worth to mention that, our methods do not assume any geometrical properties or energy models, they apply to practical and dynamic wireless networks. In addition, we conducted extensive simulations in TOSSIM to study the performance of the proposed routing protocol by comparing it with ExOR [1]. I...|$|R

25|$|The Earl of Eglinton was {{the owner}} of Ardrossan Harbour and wished to {{encourage}} any initiative that would enhance the value of his property, and he lent his support to the scheme. Encouraged by this, the company presented a Bill in the 1884 session for a much more ambitious scheme, dropping the junction with the G and making lines to Ardrossan itself, and to Irvine and Kilbirnie. The 1884 Act also changed the company's name to The Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway. Its capital was £375,000. A further Act was obtained in 1885 authorising substantial subscription in the scheme by the Caledonian Railway, which was in any case going to work the line. The Caledonian also committed itself to long term carriage contracts with mineral <b>forwarders,</b> relying on the new line. Eglinton was made chairman of the company.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{suppose that}} a {{container}} ship comes into port in Miami, Florida, United States. The ship, which is Liberian-registered, is wanted as security for various debts incurred by its Master while in Denmark. Made {{aware of the}} ship's presence, a local lawyer moves to impose a lien which involves a form of arrest by means of de novo proceedings in rem. The local Federal district sitting in Admiralty determines that the ship's Master had ostensible authority as an agent to pledge the credit of the ship's owners (who are English). It also determines that neither the ship nor its owners have violated American law in any way, and the local court {{is not in a}} good position to hear witnesses who are all resident in other states. Further, major liability in demurrage to the innocent charterers, <b>forwarders,</b> etc. will be incurred if the ship is detained without just cause, so it would not be unreasonable for the Federal Court to decline jurisdiction. Whether there is subsequent litigation in another state will depend on the tactics of the creditors. Without a lien over the ship or the ability to obtain some form of control over the assets of the debtor, making a claim for money owing may not be cost-effective. But if there have already been proceedings on the issue of liability before a court of competent jurisdiction in another state so that the action in Miami is purely by way of enforcement, the Miami jurisdiction, whether it be state or federal would be the forum conveniens because the ship is physically within the jurisdiction.|$|E

60|$|It {{had been}} from the sacredness {{attached}} to this Caabah Stone and Hagar's Well, from the pilgrimings of all tribes of Arabs thither, that Mecca took its rise as a Town. A great town once, though much decayed now. It has no natural advantage for a town; stands in a sandy hollow amid bare barren hills, {{at a distance from}} the sea; its provisions, its very bread, have to be imported. But so many pilgrims needed lodgings: and then all places of pilgrimage do, from the first, become places of trade. The first day pilgrims meet, merchants have also met: where men see themselves assembled for one object, they find that they can accomplish other objects which depend on meeting together. Mecca became the Fair of all Arabia. And thereby indeed the chief staple and warehouse of whatever Commerce there was between the Indian and the Western countries, Syria, Egypt, even Italy. It had at one time a population of 100,000; buyers, <b>forwarders</b> of those Eastern and Western products; importers for their own behoof of provisions and corn. The government was a kind of irregular aristocratic republic, not without a touch of theocracy. Ten Men of a chief tribe, chosen in some rough way, were Governors of Mecca, and Keepers of the Caabah. The Koreish were the chief tribe in Mahomet's time; his own family was of that tribe. The rest of the Nation, fractioned and cut asunder by deserts, lived under similar rude patriarchal governments by one or several: herdsmen, carriers, traders, generally robbers too; being oftenest at war one with another, or with all: held together by no open bond, if it were not this meeting at the Caabah, where all forms of Arab Idolatry assembled in common adoration;--held mainly by the inward indissoluble bond of a common blood and language. In this way had the Arabs lived for long ages, unnoticed by the world; a people of great qualities, unconsciously waiting for the day when they should become notable to all the world. Their Idolatries appear to have been in a tottering state; much was getting into confusion and fermentation among them. Obscure tidings of the most important Event ever transacted in this world, the Life and Death of the Divine Man in Judea, at once the symptom and cause of immeasurable change to all people in the world, had in the course of centuries reached into Arabia too; and could not but, of itself, have produced fermentation there.|$|E
