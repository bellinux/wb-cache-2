40|$|Currently, wind {{is one of}} the inexhaustible {{energies}} {{that are}} most viable; seeking for alternative energy sources has as motivation to reduce the pollution generated by power sources that use non-renewable resources. This need has led to detailed studies of characterization of wind at different scales; this research analyzes the contribution of the breeze on the wind power potential in the coastal zone of Tamaulipas. Data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) were used and validated with in situ observations recorded by four meteorological stations in the coastal area of Tamaulipas and a marine buoy located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. In this validation the correlations between the observations and the reanalysis were generally above 0. 80. For the period from January 2000 to December 2010, wind and temperature data were filtered to separate the low frequencies and the diurnal signal. A steady and significant contribution of the breeze was determined during the warm months of the year (March, April, May, and June), this is up to 34 % of the total wind intensity (wind of low frequency plus diurnal wind). During these warm months, the breeze reaches intensities above 2. 2, which is enough to operate <b>domestic</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> unlike those months with a lower temperature (October, November, December and January), when the breeze is not intense enough to generate power electricity. The most intense breeze occurs in southern Tamaulipas. If only the wind potential of breeze were exploited to generate electricity, over 700 kW h would be produced annually...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a bottom up approach for the peak load leveling of the Residential Distribution Feeder, by establishing local Microgrids. Which utilizes the sources within the Microgrid {{to reduce the}} dependence of the Distribution feeder on the maingrid during peak hours. The Microgrid presented here is mainly configured to use locally distributed Microenergy and Storage systems like Rooftop Solar Photo voltaics, Home-UPS systems(with an additional circuitry), <b>Domestic</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> Micro Renewable Energy sources as a source subsystem. The Micro grid exploits the potential of these resources by combining and controlling them appropriately using communication, Information Technology, Intelligent Algorithms and Advanced Metering Infrastructure. Each of the micro energy sources will be connected through inverters connected in parallel to the Microgrid forming a Parallel Inverter Source Subsystem(PISS). The Droop current sharing technique has been adopted for this PISS. A Threshold value of load is selected, above normal load usage based on the desired leveling. Each Microgrid will be governed by a decisive node known as Gravity node. This Node will switch the loads based on the Threshold value between the PISS and main grid using the Load Optimization Algorithm. This is Implemented and Simulated using MATLAB with a mock data of Load Samples. The Algorithm makes use of the input parameters like load usage history and load frequency for switching. By extending this concept of the Microgrids to other feeders the load demand on the main grid can be made more uniform. A resulting utility architecture composed of such supportive Microgrids is presented here. Â© 2013 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Emerging {{economies are}} {{increasingly}} contributing to global innovation, including clean-tech innovation. The development of China's wind power sector {{has often been}} used to illustrate this point. China's domestic wind power market is {{the largest in the}} world and is largely supplied by domestic manufacturers. Competition for market share in the domestic market may pressure firms to innovate, which consecutively improves prospects for global expansion. This paper reviews developments in China's <b>domestic</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> market using the Technological Innovation System framework. We analyze the pressure to innovate arising from market competition and assess the prospects for global expansion of Chinese wind turbine manufacturers. We conclude that domestic customers are not pressured or incentivized to perform with respect to power output, such that turbine manufacturers are not pressured to perform with respect to turbine efficiency or maintenance needs. Pressure to innovate is further reduced by formalizing connections between wind farm developers and turbine manufacturers. Chinese turbine manufacturers cannot yet compete with leading global brands in technological leadership. The prospects for exports are improved, however, by the preferential supply of project financing from institutional investors, such as the China Development Bank, from Chinese utilities that seek global expansion and from the manufacturers themselves.
