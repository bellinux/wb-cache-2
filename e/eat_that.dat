5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, {{was for the}} murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with so little to <b>eat</b> <b>that</b> {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on his stomach, placed him in the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.|$|E

25|$|During a Roadblock {{challenge}} in Mendoza, Argentina, {{in the third}} leg of the race, contestants had to eat four pounds of meat. Mariano began the roadblock but very quickly determined he would not or could not <b>eat</b> <b>that</b> quantity. The penalty for not finishing the Roadblock was a 4-hour delay. By convincing several other contestants to refuse to participate, he ensured that several contestants {{were on the same}} timetable as he and Brkich. Also in South America, Mariano pooled his money with some other racers to bribe the bus driver to let the teams that contributed off earlier. When he did bribe the driver, Mariano used none of his own money.|$|E

25|$|In Māori mythology, the ocean-going canoe Māhuhu voyaged from Hawaiki to New Zealand and {{overturned}} on {{the northern}} side of the entrance. It was commanded by the chief Rongomai, who drowned. His body was eaten by araara (white trevally), and his descendants to this day will not <b>eat</b> <b>that</b> type of fish. The first European shipwreck was the Aurora, a 550-ton barque, in 1840, {{and the most recent}} was the yacht Aosky in 1994. Today, the remains of wrecks still become visible under certain tidal and sand conditions. The Kaipara is rarely used today for shipping, and no large settlements lie close to its shores, although many small communities lie along its coastline.|$|E

After that, the ala brought lunch and said to the woman, “Eat, kuma.” “How can I eat after I saw a poker and a broom fighting in the first room?” “Eat, kuma, eat. Those are my maids: they fight about which one should take the broom and sweep.” “How can I eat after I saw human arms and legs {{in the second and third}} rooms?” And the ala told her, “Eat, kuma, <b>eat.</b> <b>That</b> is my food.” “How can I eat, kuma, after I saw the sixth room full of blood?” “Eat, kuma, <b>eat.</b> <b>That</b> is the wine that I drink.” “How can I eat after I saw that you had taken your head off and were delousing it, having fixed a horse’s head on yourself?” The ala, after hearing that, ate both the woman and her child.|$|E

500|$|Peng {{was born}} in 1898 {{in the village of}} Shixiang, Xiangtan County, Hunan. His {{personal}} name at birth was [...] "Dehua". Peng's family lived in a thatched-straw hut and owned approximately 1.5 acres of irrigated land, on which the family grew bamboo, sweet potatoes, tea, cotton, and various vegetables. His father also operated a bean curd shop. The income from the land and shop supported an extended family of eight people, including Peng, his three brothers, his parents, his grandmother, and a grand-uncle. Peng's grand-uncle had joined and fought for the Taiping rebellion, and used to tell Peng about the old Taiping ideals: that everyone should have enough food to <b>eat,</b> <b>that</b> women should not bind their feet, and that land should be redistributed equally. Peng later described his own class background as [...] "lower-middle peasant".|$|E

This city is thickly populated by people, of whom only the lead character Haroun and his parents are ever happy, {{while in the north}} of the city are factories wherein sadness is allegedly manufactured and exported. The factories produce air pollution that is only relieved during the monsoon, which also heralds the arrival of pomfret into the nearby waters.
