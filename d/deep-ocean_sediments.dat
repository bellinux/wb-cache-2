40|$|A Lagrangian {{analysis}} of particles sinking through a velocity field observed by Eulerian frame measurements {{was used to}} evaluate the effects of horizontal advection and particle sinking speed on particle fluxes as measured by moored sediment traps. Characteristics of the statistical funnel above moored <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>sediment</b> traps at the German JGOFS quasi-time series station at 47 N, 20 W (Biotrans site) were determined. The analysis suggests that the distance and direction between a given sediment trap and the region at the surface where the particles were produced depends on the mean sinking velocity of the particles, the horizontal velocity field above the trap and the deployment depth of the trap. Traps moored at different depths at a given mooring site can collect particles originating from different, separated regions at the surface ocean. Catchment areas for a given trap vary between different years. Typical distances between catchment areas of traps from different water depth but for a given time period (e. g., the spring season) are similar or even larger compared to typical length scales of mesoscale variability of phytoplankton biomass observed in the temperate northeast Atlantic. This implies that particles sampled at a certain time at different depth horizons may originate from completely independent epipelagic systems. Furthermore catchment areas move with time according to changes in the horizontal flow field which jeopardizes the common treatment of interpreting a series of particle flux measurements as a simple time series. The results presented in this work demonstrate that the knowledge of the temporal and spatial variability of the velocity field above <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>sediment</b> traps is of great importance to the interpretation of particle flux measurements. Therefore, the one-dimensional interpretation of particle flux observations should be taken with care...|$|R

When DMI was utilized as the sole source of carbon and energy, it was transformed by hydrolysis initially, forming monomethyl isophthalate (MMI) and isophthalate acid (IA) as degradation intermediates. DMI and MMI were completely transformed to MMI and IA in about 100 h, respectively. Degradation of IA was completed in about 55 h. Analysis of total organic carbon in the culture medium confirmed that more than 80 % of the substrate carbon was mineralized. Bacterial esterase induced by a range of substrates could be assessed using p-nitrophenyl acetate as the common substrate using crude enzyme preparation. The decreasing trend of Km values derived from the Michaelis-Menten equation was dimethyl phthalate (DMP) > monomethyl phthalate (MMP) > dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) > Liver esterase > DMI > MMI > monomethyl terephthalate (MMT), indicating that higher Km values were obtained by di-esters than mono-ester and the esters induced by terephthalate esters showed the highest activity. This investigation suggests that biochemical pathways for phthalate esters share many common characteristics and the esterases induced by different substrates are highly specific.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>sediments</b> {{from the}} North Atlantic abyssal plains is examined {{within the context}} of a recognised framework, the Sensitivity Framework, which was developed by Cotecchia & Chandler for structured terrestrial clays. The <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>sediments</b> have very high sensitivities, of the order of those of quick clays, but in volumetric compression their destructuration occurs at more moderate rates, similar to those usually found in terrestrial clays of medium sensitivities. The deep-sea sediments were retrieved using different types of sampler, which influenced greatly the strength and stiffness of the different samples. In particular, in the lower-quality samples the greater disturbance caused by sampling is responsible for changing their behaviour from brittle to ductile during shearing after compression to stresses post-gross yield, giving them an apparent insensitivity to shear strains. Results from numerical analyses using a constitutive model that was developed for structured terrestrial clays are presented.

We present data on diatom flux assemblages and the biogeochemical properties of sinking particles to explain the enhanced particulate organic carbon (POC) export fluxes observed in response to natural iron supply in the Crozet Islands region (CROZeX). Moored <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>sediment</b> traps (> 2000 m) were located beneath a naturally fertilized island bloom and beneath an adjacent High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) control site. Deep-ocean carbon flux from the naturally-fertilized bloom area was tightly correlated (R = 0. 83, n = 12, P < 0. 0006) with the resting spore flux of a single island-associated diatom species, Eucampia antarctica var. antarctica. The unusually well preserved state of the Eucampia-associated carbon flux, determined by amino acid studies of organic matter degradation, was likely influenced by their ecology, since diatom resting spores are adapted to settle rapidly out of the surface ocean preserving viable cells. The naturally fertilized bloom enhanced carbon flux and the resulting Si/C and Si/N ratios were 2. 0 – 3. 4 -fold and 2. 2 – 3. 5 -fold lower than those measured in the adjacent HNLC control area. The enhanced carbon export and distinctive stoichiometry observed in naturally fertilized systems is therefore largely not attributable to iron relief of open ocean diatoms, but rather to the advection and growth of diatom species characteristic of island systems and the subsequent flux of resting spores. Carbon export estimates from current natural iron fertilization studies therefore represent a highly specific response of the island systems chosen as natural laboratories {{and may not be}} appropriate analogues for the larger Southern Ocean response.

This dust has, {{depending}} on its chemistry, {{direct and indirect}} effects on global climate including reflection and absorption of solar radiation as well as transport and deposition of nutrients and metals fertilizing both ocean and land. To determine the temporal and spatial variability of Saharan dust transport and deposition and their marine environmental effects across the equatorial North Atlantic Ocean, we {{have set up a}} monitoring experiment using <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>sediment</b> traps as well as land-based dust collectors. The sediment traps were deployed at five ocean sites along a transatlantic transect between northwest Africa and the Caribbean along 12 ° N, in a down-wind extension of the land-based dust collectors placed at 19 ° N on the Mauritanian coast in Iwik. In this paper, we lay out the setup of the monitoring experiment and present the particle fluxes from sediment trap sampling over 24 continuous and synchronised intervals from October 2012 through to November 2013. We establish the temporal distribution of the particle fluxes deposited in the Atlantic and compare chemical compositions with the land-based dust collectors propagating to the down-wind sediment trap sites, and with satellite observations of Saharan dust outbreaks. First-year results show that the total mass fluxes in the ocean are highest at the sampling sites in the east and west, closest to the African continent and the Caribbean, respectively. Element ratios reveal that the lithogenic particles deposited nearest to Africa are most similar in composition to the Saharan dust collected in Iwik. Down-wind increasing Al, Fe and K contents suggest a downwind change in the mineralogical composition of Saharan dust and indicate an increasing contribution of clay minerals towards the west. In the westernmost Atlantic, admixture of re-suspended clay-sized sediments advected towards the deep sediment trap cannot be excluded. Seasonality is most prominent near both continents but generally weak, with mass fluxes dominated by calcium carbonate and clear seasonal maxima of biogenic silica towards the west.

On geological time-scales, these water mass exchanges are controlled by the deepening and shallowing of areas of ocean floor during the tectonic opening and closing of strategic oceanic gateways and the formation of ocean basins. Establishing the detailed tectonic, geodynamic, sedimentary and paleo-topographic histories of strategic oceanic basins and gateways will provide the essential framework for modelling studies that will relate these events to paleo-climate observations collected across the globe. PLATES & GATES intends to adopt a multidisciplinary approach by addressing tectonic-magmatic, geodynamic, sedimentary and biostratigraphic processes, by utilising paleo-biological and geochemical proxies as well as past and recent oceanographic conditions in the gateways, and by using state-of-the-art geophysical techniques, sediment coring, ocean drilling and accompanying land investigations. The main objectives include (1) studies of the crust/lithosphere of the polar ocean basins and polar gateways as well as their continental margins to develop a good understanding of the past and present plate kinematics, mantle processes, margin formations, and crustal subsidence and uplift processes, (2) understanding the past ocean current systems in the basins and gateways by examining the record of change preserved in <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>sediment</b> deposits and drifts, and by undertaking seismic-stratigraphic investigations and analyses of present and paleo-oceanographic proxies to derive the evolution of deep-water circulation and climate change, (3) reconstructing detailed ocean basin and gateway opening processes and constraining the timing of shallow and deep water mass exchange between basins, (4) understanding the long-term paleo-climatic history from Mesozoic-Early Tertiary Greenhouse conditions to upper Tertiary-Quaternary Icehouse conditions, and (5) identifying and modelling the role of gateway openings/closures in the global carbon cycle, bio-evolution and the development of ice-sheets and climatic changes.

40|$|Sequence stratigraphic {{analysis}} is now carried out routinely on Mesozoic–Cenozoic sedimentary basins {{with a view}} to understanding their post-rift stratal geometries and predicting facies architecture. The conventional method embodies two concepts; the physical division of strata into unconformity-bounded units and their genetic interpretation on the assumption that hierarchical changes in sea-level represent the primary control on sedimentary architecture. The genetic model is reflected in a complex descriptive terminology and derives from the development of the method in shallow-water basins, where the results of analyses typically accord with geological data constraints. Applied to deep-water underfilled basins, however, the sea-level assumption yields results that are unsatisfactory and in many cases misleading, reflecting the influence of additional controls, including tectonic movements, deep-sea currents and climate (e. g. glaciation) on stratal geometries and facies architecture. This is illustrated by comparative analyses of examples from the deep-water Cenozoic basins of the NW European Atlantic passive margin, which contain a set of seismic megasequences, bounded by unconformable to conformable surfaces, correlative from shelf to slope to basinal settings. The deep-water successions contain regional, locally diachronous, submarine unconformities that were generated in response to changes in deep-water current circulation and slope processes, rather than subaerial erosion. These bound aggradational contourite drifts that include upslope accretion against basin margins. The deep-water successions interfinger at two levels with seaward-prograding shelf-slope wedges that reflect differential tectonic movements, involving coeval uplift and subsidence. The youngest wedges formed in the last 4 Ma and record seaward progradation of the margin by up to 100 km, overprinting high-amplitude variations in sea-level and coeval with changes in <b>deep-ocean</b> currents. <b>Sediment</b> supply by fluvial sources gave way in the Pleistocene to direct glacial sediment supply to the slope. In all these instances, the stratal geometries and facies architecture cannot be attributed to a simple lowering of regional sea-level, but instead reflect a complex interplay of controlling factors including tectonic movements, changes in sediment supply, deep-water current activity and climate, in addition to sea-level.

The correlations allow us to compare isotopic ages determined for the tephra layers with ages of continental and marine biostratigraphic zones determined by magnetostratigraphy and other numerical age control and also provide iterative checks for available age control.

These discrepancies may be due to several factors, among which are (1) diachronism of the lowest and highest occurrence levels of marine faunal and floral species with latitude because of ecologic thresholds, (2) upward reworking of older forms in hemipelagic sections adjacent to the tectonically active coast of the western United States and other similar analytical problems in identification of biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic datums, (3) dissolution of microfossils or selective diagenesis of some taxa, (4) lack of precision in isotopic age calibration of these datums, (5) errors in isotopic ages of tephra beds, and (6) large variations in sedimentation rates or hiatuses in stratigraphic sections that result in age errors of interpolated datums.

The technique has since been applied by various researchers in lakes (Brand et al. 2008), rivers (McGinnis et al. 2008; Lorrai et al. 2010), shallow coastal regions (Berg et al. 2003; Kuwae et al. 2006; Berg and Huettel 2008), <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>sediments</b> (Berg et al. 2009), hard-bottom substrates (Glud et al. 2010), sea grass beds (Hume et al. 2011), and has now been extended to measure H 2 S fluxes in the Baltic Sea (this work). Whereas the EC technique has a great potential {{for a wide range of}} applications, the num-ber of users is still relatively limited. One of the largest challenges is acquiring reliable EC equipment. The concept of the EC measurement is simple—simultane-ously obtaining temporally high-resolution measurements of Simple, robust eddy correlation amplifier for aquatic dissolved oxygen and hydrogen sulfide flux measurement...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the most}} common {{technique}} for radiocarbon dating of <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>sediments</b> has been accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) analysis of hand-picked planktonic foraminifera (forams). Some studies have exposed age offsets between different sediment size fractions from the same depth within a core and this has important implications when establishing a chronological framework for palaeoceanographic records associated with a particular sediment component. The mechanisms generating the age offsets are not fully understood, a problem {{compounded by the fact}} that the fraction defined as "large" varies between different studies. To explore this problem, we dated samples of hand-picked forams from two Biogeochemical Ocean Flux Study (BOFS) cores, for which the presence of an offset between the bulk carbonate and gt 150 mum foraminiferal calcite had already been demonstrated. The presence of a constant age offset between bulk carbonate and coarse fraction material at the two BOFS sites has been confirmed, but the magnitude of the offset is dependent on whether a simple size-separation technique or hand-picking of well-preserved forams is applied. This may be explained if the selection of well preserved forams biases the sample towards those specimens that have spent least time in the surface mixed layer (SML) or have undergone less size selective mixing. Modeling of the C- 14 profiles demonstrates that SML depth and sediment accumulation rates are the same for both the bulk and coarse sediment fractions, which is consistent with the hypothesis that size-selective mixing is responsible for the age offset...|$|E
40|$|The weight {{percentage}} and mean {{size of the}} 10 – 63 μm terrigenous silt fraction (termed ‘sortable silt’) of fine-grained marine sediments have recently been argued to be proxies for near-bottom palaeocurrent intensity. This paper details the accuracy and precision of the Sedigraph 5100 and the Coulter Multisizer IIe in determining the {{weight percentage}} and mean size of the sortable silt at abundances characteristic of <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>sediments.</b> Three sortable silt standards and a fine silt/clay diluent were generated from natural deep-sea sediment of the Iceland Basin. These were used to produce silty clays with standard additions of sortable silt ranging from 1 % to 20 % of the total by weight. Accuracy was measured relative {{to the size of}} the pure spike measured by each instrument. At sortable silt abundance > 5 %, the Sedigraph and the Coulter Multisizer estimate both weight percentage and mean grain size precisely and accurately, while below 5 %, instrumental noise degrades their performance. On the basis of the Sedigraph results, a series of percentage errors is defined, which may be applied to sortable silt mean size and weight percentage estimates used in palaeoceanographic near-bottom current reconstruction. It is suggested that, ideally, palaeocurrent reconstructions should be based on Sedigraph determinations of the 0 – 63 μm grain size distribution, yielding both mean and abundance, or on Coulter Multisizer determinations of the sortable silt grain size mean. The Coulter Multisizer may prove especially useful in regions of very depleted (< 5 %) sortable silt component...|$|E
40|$|This study explores and {{develops}} {{the potential of}} fossil mammals to differentiate between the various climatic episodes of the post-Anglian Middle Pleistocene in Britain. Mammalian fossils are particularly valuable as biostratigraphic indicators on account of their morphological evolution and rapid turnover, through origination and extinction of species. Furthermore, the large-scale climatic fluctuations that affected north-west Europe during the Quaternary produced major shifts in the geographical distributions of many species, resulting in discernible patterns of presence and absence in the fossil record of a particular region. The development of a globally-applicable climatostratigraphic framework, based on the oxygen isotope record from <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>sediments,</b> has provided a new and challenging scheme for {{the interpretation of the}} British Quaternary record. Long fluvial sequences in Britain have been related to this record with considerable success, thereby providing a detailed archive of climatic change through the Pleistocene. The Thames valley was selected as a framework for the relative dating of the various climatic fluctuations, since it has been claimed to have the most reliably-dated long terrestrial sequence in the later Middle Pleistocene. The Thames model was therefore adopted as a testable hypothesis against which the mammalian evidence could be compared. The findings of this study confirm the presence of four complete climatic cycles between the Anglian and the Holocene, each with its own distinctive mammalian suite. In addition, it has been possible to identify subdivisions within these temperate stages, probably representing smaller-scale climatic fluctuations within an interglacial, and perhaps corresponding to isotopic substages. It has been possible to resolve a longstanding controversy concerning the age of the British type Hoxnian Interglacial. Amino acid geochronology had suggested that sediments at Hoxne belonged to a later interglacial than deposits from the first post-Anglian temperate episode in the Thames valley, such as Swanscombe. The {{results of the present study}} reveal close similarity between the mammalian fauna from Hoxne and that from Swanscombe, suggesting that there was indeed a single Hoxnian Interglacial, and that it directly post-dated the Anglian (i. e. Stage 11). Sediments of this age can be distinguished from those attributable to two other late Middle Pleistocene interglacials, all of them distinct from and older than, the Ipswichian. It has been suggested that distinctive mammalian assemblages can be identified from interglacials equivalent to oxygen isotope stages 9 and 7; moreover, it is apparent that the assemblages from warm Substages 7 c and 7 a differed from one another in species composition. Certain useful characters have also been determined, which can permit useful separation of some of the late Middle Pleistocene cold episodes, although in comparison with the interglacials, the evidence from these is scanty. The present study has provided a new biostratigraphic framework that may be both tested and refined as new sites become available in Britain, and also compared with the evidence from continental north-west Europe...|$|E
