5|$|After {{the final}} battle, which {{resulted}} in an Ottoman victory and in Petar Kružić's death, the Klis defenders, who were lacking in water supplies, finally surrendered to the Ottomans {{in exchange for their}} freedom on 12 March 1537. Citizens fled the town, while the Uskoci retreated to the city of Senj, where they continued fighting the Ottoman army. Klis became an administrative centre or sanjak (Kilis Sancağı) of the Bosnia Eyalet, and would remain so <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Ottoman wars in Europe, Klis Fortress {{became an}} {{administrative}} centre or sanjak (Kilis Sancağı) of the Bosnia Eyalet, and would remain so <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b> As the first Sanjak-Beg of Klis, Murat-beg Tardić built a notable mosque inside the Klis Fortress. That same year, the Ottoman forces took Vrana, while Nadin and Perušić fell in 1538.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, the {{purchasing}} power of Byzantine merchants became such that it could influence prices in markets as far afield as Cairo and Alexandria. In reflection of their success, emperors gave merchants the right to become members of the Senate, that is to integrate themselves with the ruling elite. This had an end {{by the end of}} the eleventh century when political machinations allowed the landed aristocracy to secure the throne <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> and more. Following that phase, however, the enterprising merchants bounced back and wielded real clout during the time of the Third Crusade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era, {{population}} peaked {{in the mid}} 19th century at just over 32,000 and declined <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> thereafter {{to a low of}} fewer than 18,000 in the 1970s. Declines were particularly significant in the outlying islands, some of which remain vulnerable to ongoing losses. Although Orkney is in many ways very distinct from the other islands and archipelagos of Scotland these trends are very similar to those experienced elsewhere. The archipelago's population grew by 11% in the decade to 2011 as recorded by the census. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E
5|$|The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy is a {{cookbook}} by Hannah Glasse (1708–1770) {{first published in}} 1747. It was a best seller <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> after its first publication, dominating the English-speaking market and making Glasse {{one of the most}} famous cookbook authors of her time. The book ran through at least 40 editions, many of them pirated. It was published in Dublin from 1748, and in America from 1805.|$|E

5|$|The English chemist Charles Hatchett {{reported}} a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, {{a series of}} scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> both names were used interchangeably. Niobium was officially adopted as {{the name of the}} element in 1949, but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the New York City Subway, which opened in 1904, helped bind the new city together, as did additional bridges to Brooklyn. In the 1920s Manhattan experienced large arrivals of African-Americans {{as part of the}} Great Migration from the southern United States, and the Harlem Renaissance, part of a larger boom time in the Prohibition era that included new skyscrapers competing for the skyline. New York City became the most populous city in the world in 1925, overtaking London, which had reigned <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b> Manhattan's majority white ethnic group declined from 98.7% in 1900 to 58.3% by 1990.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Love's Last Shift, {{which never}} again {{performed}} after the 1690s, The Relapse has retained its audience appeal. In the 18th century, however, its tolerant attitude towards actual and attempted adultery gradually became unacceptable to public opinion, {{and the original}} play was <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> replaced on the stage by Sheridan's moralised version A Trip to Scarborough (1777). On the modern stage, The Relapse has been established {{as one of the}} most popular Restoration comedies, valued for Vanbrugh's light, throwaway wit and the consummate acting part of Lord Foppington, a burlesque character with a dark side.|$|E

5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b> While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E
5|$|During the Ottoman wars in Europe, Klis Fortress was, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> an {{administrative}} centre or sanjak (Kilis Sancağı) of the Bosnia Eyalet. On April 7, 1596, Split noblemen Ivan Alberti and Nikola Cindro, along with Uskoci, Poljičani, and Kaštelani irregulars, organized an occupation of Klis. Assisted by dissident {{elements of the}} Turkish garrison, they succeeded. Bey Mustafa responded by bringing more than 10,000 soldiers under the fortress. General Ivan Lenković, leading 1,000 Uskoci, came in relief of the 1,500 Klis defenders. During the battle, Ivan Lenković and his men retreated after he was wounded in battle, and the fortress was lost to the Turks, on May 31. Nevertheless, this temporary relief resounded in Europe and among the local population.|$|E
5|$|Economic growth {{began to}} falter {{by the end}} of the 13th century, owing to a {{combination}} of over-population, land shortages and depleted soils. The loss of life in the Great Famine of 1315–17 shook the English economy severely and population growth ceased; the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 then killed around half the English population, with major implications for the post-plague economy. The agricultural sector shrank, with higher wages, lower prices and shrinking profits leading to the final demise of the old demesne system and the advent of the modern farming system of cash rents for lands. The Peasants Revolt of 1381 shook the older feudal order and limited the levels of royal taxation considerably <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> to come. The 15th century saw the growth of the English cloth industry and the establishment of a new class of international English merchant, increasingly based in London and the South-West, prospering at the expense of the older, shrinking economy of the eastern towns. These new trading systems brought about the end of many of the international fairs and the rise of the chartered company. Together with improvements in metalworking and shipbuilding, this represents the end of the medieval economy, and the beginnings of the early modern period in English economics.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire, roads in the region deteriorated. Only the Via Sclavonica is known to have existed in the region by year 1030. It was an eastwest route {{spanning}} from Pazin to Poreč. Road transport in the region lost significance after the peninsula was divided between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Republic of Venice. From 18091813, the TriestePula route was rebuilt by the First French Empire, after the French captured the entire region from Venice and the Habsburgs. Upgrades to the regional road network continued after the Austrian Empire acquired Istria at the 18141815 Congress of Vienna. By 1830, the road network in Istria had expanded to a degree that would not change <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> and a half. The only significant improvement of region's roads was paving of the TriestePula road in 1930s.|$|E

The highway travels northeasterly through the southern {{side of the}} capital city, as far as Jolly Road. There it turns northward through the Old Everett Neighborhood. The street is bordered by commercial properties in this area. M-99 widens into a boulevard south of the intersection with Mount Hope Avenue before crossing the Grand River. North of the river, the highway is bordered by {{the site of the}} former Lansing Car Assembly plant, which <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> produced Oldsmobiles and other GM cars. M-99 ends at a junction with I-496 just north of the assembly plant area at exit5; MLK Boulevard continues north from this interchange as the Capitol Loop.|$|E
5|$|Hammurabi was an Amorite First Dynasty {{king of the}} {{city-state}} of Babylon, and {{inherited the}} power from his father, Sin-Muballit, in c. 1792 BC. Babylon {{was one of the}} many largely Amorite ruled city-states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile agricultural land. Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the literate classes throughout the Middle East under Hammurabi. The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC which controlled little territory outside of the city itself. Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger and more powerful kingdoms such as Elam, Assyria, Isin, Eshnunna and Larsa <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> or so after its founding. However his father Sin-Muballit had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian hegemony and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of Borsippa, Kish, and Sippar.|$|E

5|$|Holland {{looks at}} the {{earliest}} evidence for Muhammad, Mecca and Islam {{in the first century}} of the Arab Empire, pointing to a lack of evidence in the historical record to support the traditional account. Highlighting that very little Muslim testimony from the 7th century exists, he considers it suspect that 30 years after Muhammad's death, Muawiyah I became leader of the Arab Empire in Jerusalem despite showing little sign of being Muslim, and that no mention of Muhammad or Islam can be found in any of Muawiyah's inscriptions, coins, or documents. Holland proceeds to note that {{with the exception of a}} single ambiguous reference in the Qur'an, there is no mention of Mecca in any datable text <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> after Muhammed's death. He points out that in the Qur'an, the Prophet appears to address farmers and agriculturalists while his opponents are described as keeping cattle and growing olives and vines. This appears to describe an environment foreign to Mecca, where there was no agriculture; thus Holland posits that the location attributed to Mecca in the Qur'an more closely fits a city in the Negev desert, in what is now southern Israel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after Trafalgar, Gibraltar became a major supply base for {{supporting}} the Spanish uprising against Napoleon. The French invasion of Spain in 1808 prompted Gibraltar's British garrison {{to cross the border}} and destroy the ring of Spanish fortresses around the bay, as well as the old Spanish fortified lines on the isthmus, to deny the French the ability to besiege Gibraltar or control the bay from shore batteries. French forces reached as far as San Roque, just north of Gibraltar, but did not attempt to target Gibraltar itself as they believed that it was impregnable. The French besieged Tarifa, further down the coast, in 1811–12 but gave up after a month. Gibraltar faced no further military threat <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ICJ {{delivered}} its {{judgment on}} 23 May 2008. It held that although Pedra Branca {{had originally been}} under the sovereignty of Johor, the conduct of Singapore and its predecessors à titre de souverain (with {{the title of a}} sovereign) and the failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to such conduct showed that by 1980, when the dispute between the parties arose, sovereignty over the island had passed to Singapore. The relevant conduct on the part of Singapore and its predecessors included investigating marine accidents {{in the vicinity of the}} island, planning land reclamation works, installing naval communications equipment, and requiring Malaysian officials wishing to visit the island to obtain permits. In contrast, Johor and its successors had taken no action with respect to the island from June 1850 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> or more. In 1953 the Acting Secretary of the State of Johor had stated that Johor did not claim ownership of Pedra Branca. All visits made to the island had been with Singapore's express permission, and maps published by Malaysia in the 1960s and 1970s indicated that it recognised Singapore's sovereignty over Pedra Branca.|$|E
