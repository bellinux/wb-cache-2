40|$|Spatial {{memory is}} {{supported}} by multiple parallel representations of the environment. Egocentric perspective (body-centered) and allocentric representations (objectcentered) are integrated to allow correct interaction with the world. According to Milner and Goodale (1995, 2008), the action-related dorsal system is specialized for location of objects in space and visuo-motor integration, and uses an egocentric frame of reference. The perception-related ventral system is specialized for categorical recognition of objects and forms, and supports an allocentric frame of reference. Here we use a Distance Judgment Task to explore the use of different spatial frames in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). Following the dorsal stream vulnerability hypothesis (Atkinson et al., 2007) children with CP might have more <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> egocentric <b>judgments</b> and <b>in</b> the processing of peri-personal space than controls. No significant difference emerged between CP children and controls <b>in</b> allocentric <b>judgments,</b> whereas performance was worse <b>in</b> egocentric <b>judgment,</b> indicating inefficient use of the body-centered representations...|$|R
40|$|Spatial mental {{representations}} {{learned by}} the study of maps {{are thought to be}} orientation specific. Studies have shown that people have <b>difficulty</b> <b>in</b> making <b>judgments</b> from an orientation which is different from the orientation of the map itself. It has been hypothesized that such alignment effects can be attributed to differences in the number of viewpoints encountered during learning. The current study used virtual environments to test this hypothesis. Participants were presented several objects located on a plain within an immersive virtual environment. They learned the environment to a criterion level. The critical task for all experiments was to judge the accuracy with which subjects could identify correct triads of object layouts as well as the response latency to make the judgment. The results of the first experiment showed a linear increase <b>in</b> <b>judgment</b> time as the amount of normalization required of the stimulus increased thus supporting the multiple views theory. The results of the second experiment suggested that four viewpoints were needed for simple spacial configurations before orientation specificity could be eliminated...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the political communication of opinion through social networks. Attention focuses on opinion variance within populations and networks, and how this variance affects communication among individuals. Particularly in the context of ambiguous patterns of communication between individuals, people may experience <b>difficulty</b> <b>in</b> forming <b>judgments</b> regarding the opinions of others. In these situations, environmental priors become useful devices for forming judgments regarding the opinions of other individuals. The problem that arises is related to the utility of these environmental priors when discord rather than unanimity characterizes the contextual distribution of opinion. The paper’s argument is that discussions among citizens are most enlightening when surrounding opinion is marked by higher levels of disagreement. The paper’s analyses are based on data taken from the 1996 Indianapolis-St. Louis study...|$|R

The essay argues for a set of partial, limited, and “realist” responses that reduce some elements of burden, without pretending to provide a solution that is in any sense ideal or wholly just.

40|$|Abstract — During a mission, {{detecting}} failure {{accurately and}} implementing countermeasures in time may decide {{the success of}} a space mission. Chang’E- 1 mission is the first lunar exploration mission of China. The satellite has several different telemetry formats and bit rates. Moreover, the accuracy requirement of orbit control is high and demands real-time handling during contingency or abort operations. In addition, the time duration of the mission is very long, lasting more than a year.

40|$|In Trollhättan {{municipality}} approximately 700 {{school bus}} stops are in service. To ensure {{high quality of}} the performance of school bus operations, with focus on traffic safety, it was decided to conduct a survey of bus stops including assessments of risks. This master thesis aims to identify the factors affecting road safety at bus stops and pedestrian connections, and to conduct an inventory and analysis of selected sites in Trollhättan municipality. The work also aims to show examples of how risk assessment should be performed in future studies. A risk analysis model provided by the Swedish Transport Administration is supplemented and used in a field study. The risk assessment is based on, inter alia, traffic flow, visibility distance, lighting, speed of traffic and the presence of bus shelter. A total number of 93 bus stops and 228 pedestrian connections are examined during the field study. The result shows that the connections are generally a larger traffic safety problem than the bus stops. The risk analysis model uses both objective and subjective assessments. Applying subjective assessments to supplement objective is beneficial, but there are some <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> making subjective <b>judgments.</b> Those require that the evaluator possess much knowledge and experience in traffic safety {{and it is difficult to}} always be consistent when setting subjective ratings. The group recommends the city of Trollhättan to proceed with field testing of bus stops and pedestrian connections, and to regularly conduct surveys of passenger’s experiences and views on safety. Furthermore it is recommended that the bus drivers carry out a risk analysis from their perspective...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} used event-related brain {{potentials}} to investigate semantic, phonological and syntactic processes in adult German dyslexic and normal readers {{in a word}} reading task. Pairs of German words were presented one word at a time. Subjects had to perform a semantic judgment task (house – window; are they semantically related?), a rhyme judgment task (house – mouse; do they rhyme?) and a gender judgment task (das – Haus [the – house]; is the gender correct? [in German, house has a neutral gender: das Haus]). Results Normal readers responded faster compared to dyslexic readers in all three tasks. Onset latencies of the N 400 component were delayed in dyslexic readers <b>in</b> the rhyme <b>judgment</b> and <b>in</b> the gender <b>judgment</b> task, but not <b>in</b> the semantic <b>judgment</b> task. N 400 and the anterior negativity peak amplitudes did not differ between the two groups. However, the N 400 persisted longer in the dyslexic group <b>in</b> the rhyme <b>judgment</b> and <b>in</b> the semantic <b>judgment</b> tasks. Conclusion These findings indicate that dyslexics are phonologically impaired (delayed N 400 <b>in</b> the rhyme <b>judgment</b> task) but that they also have <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> other, non-phonological aspects of reading (longer response times, longer persistence of the N 400). Specifically, semantic and syntactic integration seem to require more effort for dyslexic readers and take longer irrespective of the reading task {{that has to be}} performed. </p...|$|R
