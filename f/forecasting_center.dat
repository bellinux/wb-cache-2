In addition, Russia argued that it faced new threats on its southern borders: the possibility of missile launches from Iran {{and the expansion of}} Islamist terrorism, which required - in the perspective of Russia - Russian military presence in Georgia and Armenia. Colonel Anatoli Tesiganouk, Head of Russia's Military <b>Forecasting</b> <b>Center,</b> argued that NATO took no notice of Russia's position because NATO's leaders still had the same mental stereotypes that took shape during the Cold War; that {{a large part of the}} Western elite still regarded Russia as a kind of USSR, ignoring the fact that Russia [...] has not only new borders, but also new aspirations, new international partners, and new threats. These stereotypes could have wittingly or unwittingly affected the relations in the NATO-Russia Council.|$|E

500|$|The {{detail that}} can be given into a {{forecast}} decreases with time as these errors increase. There becomes a point when the errors are so large that the forecast has no correlation with the actual state of the atmosphere. [...] Looking at a single forecast model gives no indication of how likely that forecast is to be correct. Ensemble forecasting entails the production of many forecasts in order to reflect the uncertainty in the initial state of the atmosphere (due to errors in the observations and insufficient sampling). The uncertainty in the forecast can then be assessed by the range of different forecasts produced. [...] Ensemble forecasts are increasingly being used for operational weather forecasting (for example at European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and the Canadian <b>forecasting</b> <b>center).</b> [...] Ensemble mean forecasts for precipitation have the same problems associated with their use in other fields, as they average out more extreme values, and therefore have limited usefulness for extreme events. [...] In {{the case of the}} SREF ensemble mean, used within the United States, this decreasing usefulness starts with values as low as [...]|$|E

2500|$|The {{sea state}} is {{described}} as a spectrum; the sea surface can be decomposed into waves of varying frequencies using the principle of superposition. The waves are also separated by their direction of propagation. The model domain size can range from regional to the global ocean. [...] Smaller domains can be nested within a global domain to provide higher resolution in a region of interest. [...] The sea state evolves according to physical equations – based on a spectral representation of the conservation of wave action – which include: wave propagation / advection, refraction (by bathymetry and currents), shoaling, and a source function which allows for wave energy to be augmented or diminished. [...] The source function has at least three terms: wind forcing, nonlinear transfer, and dissipation by whitecapping. Wind data are typically provided from a separate atmospheric model from an operational weather <b>forecasting</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
