DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because <b>it</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E

Marshall Fine, writing in the Huffington Post, viewed the film as an [...] "overstuffed blend of agitprop and melodrama" [...] that contains a cautionary story pertaining to unchecked capitalism.

These accusations constitute a powerful ethical argument against qualia being something going on in the brain, and these implications are probably largely responsible for {{the fact that in the}} 20th century it was regarded as not only freakish, but also dangerously misguided to uphold the notion of sensations as going on inside the head.
