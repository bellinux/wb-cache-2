40|$|Summary : The tap of {{the intake}} {{is located on}} the bank slope of a dam and the reservoir. The section of slant pipe ranging {{downstream}} is generally bigger compared with a tap. The diameter of slant pipe is 2 times bigger in comparison with the tap diameter. Koromogawa IV dam in Iwate prefecture is a disaster prevention dam for the purpose of flood control. The intake part functions as discharge adjustment facility. Inasmuch as, opening of the tap and slant pipe at its entrance is same, thus it is necessary to realize that the flow condition of the downstream does not influence dam water level directly. Therefore, rapid expansion part of tap was subjacent and air was supplied into pipe from here and open flow was realized.

40|$|International audienceWhile {{many studies}} have been {{achieved}} on the interactions between groundwater and deep tunnels, {{in order to identify}} the evolution of pore pressure around the structure and to characterize the flow to its leaky parts, few studies have dealt with the impact of the carrying out of an impervious gallery in a shallow aquifer. The induced change in the piezometric level of the aquifer and the one in the hydraulic gradient of the flow however can, in this case, have significant consequences, in particular when the linear structure is located in an urban environment. This paper investigates, in steady state, the case of a straight tunnel having a horizontal axis perpendicular to the direction of the regional groundwater flow and a circular or square cross section. The aim is to determine the additional lost head Δh s due to the tunnel (i. e. additional to that resulting from the regional flow, supposed to be uniform with a hydraulic gradient i 0). In the context of a horizontal confined aquifer having a thickness 2 B and of a tunnel of radius R located in the middle part of the aquifer, an analogy can be established with the flow above a hydraulic threshold resulting from a local rise of the elevation of the base of an aquifer, having a thickness B, on a width 2 R and with a vertical maximum amplitude R. When neglecting the vertical component of the hydraulic gradient compared to its horizontal component, analytical solutions are developed for various <b>hydraulic</b> threshold <b>shapes</b> (rectangular, triangular and circular), based on the equivalence with a local change in the transmissivity of an aquifer keeping a constant thickness. The corresponding formulas take the form: h_s - h_ 0 / h_ 0 = f(a), with a = R/B and Δh 0 = 2 Ri 0. The use of these formulas shows that the additional lost head Δh s due to the hydraulic threshold is proportional to i 0 and that, for values of the ratio a 0), a significant rise of the water table upstream of the tunnel is obtained only for high values of the hydraulic gradient (5 and 10...|$|R

This rotor spins at 24, 000 rpm and consists of a complex network of series, parallel, and leakage flow passages. The objective was met by creation of a BASIC computer program called FLOWCALC! which calculates the oil flow through the rotor with a given input pressure. The solution methodology utilizes an iterative approach starting with an initial guess for the flow. It calculates the pressure drop given a flow and iterates the flow until the calculated pressure drop matches the given pressure drop. Specific information for each flow segment including <b>hydraulic</b> diameter, length, <b>shape,</b> area, and roughness are used to calculate the friction factors. The friction factors and resistance coefficients (K- factors) are used to calculate the pressure drop. The Hardy-Cross iterative solution technique was converted into computer code which was used to analyze the series/parallel network section of the rotor. FLOWCALC! was validated versus exact analytical solutions for hypothetical series, leakage, and network problems.

In Italy, legal limits are set for heavy metals in wastewaters discharged into surface water bodies (D. Lgs 152 / 06), with particularly stringent limits applying when the reclaimed wastewaters are for reuse (D. M. 185 / 03). Chemical treatments (precipitation, co-precipitation and chemical oxidation) are quite often adopted in order to greatly reduce heavy metals concentrations in the final effluent and meet the corresponding legal limits. In the last decades, many studies have been carried out on the metals removal capacity of natural systems like constructed wetlands, in particular horizontal subsurface flow (H-SSF) systems (Gambrell 1994; Kadlec and Knight, 1996; Vymazal and Krasa 2003; Ranieri 2004; Garcia et al., 2006; Paredes et al., 2006; Vymazal et al., 2006, Lesage et al., 2007; Vymazal et al., 2009).

This time depends on the hillslopes geometry (plan shape and profile curvature), soil properties and climate conditions. The saturation capacity of hillslopes affect the travel time of subsurface flow. The saturation capacity, and subsurface travel time of compound hillslopes depend on parameters such as soil depth, porosity, soil <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity, plan <b>shape</b> (convergent, parallel or divergent), hillslope length, profile curvature (concave, straight or convex) and recharge rate to the groundwater table. An equation for calculating subsurface travel time for all complex hillslopes was presented. This equation {{is a function of}} the saturation zone length (SZL) on the surface. Saturation zone length of the complex hillslopes was calculated numerically by using the hillslope-storage Boussinesq (hsB) model in the steady state conditions, so an analytical equation was presented for calculating the saturation zone length of the straight hillslopes and all plan shapes geometries. Based on our results, the convergent hillslopes become saturated very soon and they showed longer SZL with shorter travel time compared to the parallel and divergent ones. The subsurface average flow rate in convergent hillslopes is much less than the divergent ones in the steady state conditions. Concerning to subsurface travel time, convex hillslopes have more travel time in comparison to straight and concave hillslopes. The convex hillslopes exhibit more average flow rate than concave hillslopes and their saturation capacity is very low.

The samples were studied by thin section, X-ray radiograph, and magnetometer; they are discussed {{with respect to the}} tectonic implication of the vein structures to the island-arc development. Vein structures are developed in finer, more clayey, preferentially radiolarian-bearing mudstone, subvertical to the bedding plane, which is mostly horizontal. The veins are restricted to certain horizons: in the upper Oligocene at Site 787 and in the lower Miocene at Site 793. The veins are filled with a dominant clay mineral (montmorillonite), which flowed into the vein when the fracture and concomitant stress drop occurred. Some clay mineral was deposited from the fluid that invaded the vein. Some veins might have occurred as <b>hydraulic</b> fractures. The <b>shape,</b> mode of occurrence, and other structural features indicate that the veins originated either as extension fractures or shear cleavages, and then were rotated by the following shearing parallel to the bedding. Sometimes the bedding-parallel slip planes are dislocated by the veins, and sometimes vice versa. This suggests that the vein formation and bedding parallel slip alternately occurred within the same stress environment. Vein attitude was measured by a magnetometer, after alternating field demagnetization; we interpret that they originally formed as subvertical planes, the trends of which average to N 45 W. The quantity of samples studied was small, but the trends suggest that the stress field for veining might have had a relative extensional stress axis that lay subhorizontally and trended generally northeast. This stress orientation might be attributed to either bending or normal faulting in the forearc basin, {{at a time when the}} arc trended northwest...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} use of the hydraulic fracturing technique, used extensively in the United States, for {{oil and natural gas}} extraction, has significantly expanded the frac sand market and impacted freight rail corridors. This growth in the freight rail sector is expected to raise the operation and maintenance costs for the railroads due to the increase in heavy axle loads (HAL), traffic in million gross tons per year (MGT), and fouling from surface spillage. The impact of heavy axle loads has been studied in some detail; however, it is unknown how infiltration of frac sand into the ballast affects the deformation behavior of the track structure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the extent that frac sand infiltration and subsequent moisture retention in the ballast structure increases deformation as compared to clean ballast. Three ballast, and three frac sand samples were used in this study, of which the following basic properties were characterized: particle size distribution, mineralogy classification, particle shape, bulk density, void ratio, particle <b>shape,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity, and soil water characteristic curves. These properties were used to optimize the large-scale cyclic triaxial (LSCT) test method. The results of HAL tests show an increased rate of strain accumulation averaging 0. 07 %/MGT for every 30 kip car load increase. The results of the surface spillage tests show an average increased rate of strain accumulation averaging 0. 05 %/MGT, 0. 13 %/MGT, and 0. 31 %/MGT for AREMA ballast # 24, # 4 A, and # 5 respectively, for a 7 % increase in gravimetric water content.

40|$|Introduction: This paper {{concerns}} the main domain (“coutos”) of Alcobaça Abbey (central Portugal), founded in 1153. It shows {{the involvement of}} the Cistercian monks in <b>shaping</b> <b>hydraulic</b> landscapes along time. This monastic territory is limited westwards by the Atlantic ocean with a cliff coast indented by two large gulfs, the Pederneira lagoon, north, totally sanded up nowadays, and the Alfeizerão lagoon, south, of which only the São Martinho bay still exists. These landscapes have been consolidated along with the monks’ intervention in the hydrographic plan, particularly through a network of canals, the types of which can be summarized as follows: - canals for water conveyance and evacuation, to and from the abbey buildings; - canals related with water-powered engines as grain-, oil-, saw- and fulling-mills, forges and other industrial devices; - canals consequent to the diversion of rivers and streams with two main purposes:. to drain the fields in order to improve the marshes for agricultural use;. to irrigate cultures. Method: The hydraulic landscape planning has been identified and characterized through documentary research, stereoscopic interpretation of panchromatic and infrared “false colour” vertical aerial photographs, and land surveys. Findings / discussion: Flood control seems to {{have been one of the}} main hydro technical concern of the Cistercians. Their strategy was to subdivide some hydrographic basins, so that the fields would not be flooded. This was observed in the fields of the ancient Pederneira lagoon, for which an important cartography is available. But the same strategy was probably applied in the Alfeizerão fields. Besides the canals which were analyzed, other canal networks existed but it has not been possible to identify them till now because of the soil erosion or the topographic transformations together with the documental lack of knowledge. The more blatant situation {{concerns the}} old Valdeventos monastic farm, at the eastern limit of the “coutos”, where was found a large water storage structure, a tank, presumably to supply an irrigation canal network. Conclusion: Between the early 12 th century and the mid 18 th century, the Cistercian monks of the Alcobaça Abbey conceived and set in their “coutos” a hydraulic landscape composed by a network of canals with different purposes, and other water devices.

40|$|Design {{water levels}} are a basic concept in flood risk {{management}} practice. These water levels with a specified return period {{are used for}} the design of dikes and other flood protection measures along the river Meuse. Current practice is that these water levels are determined by hydrodynamic simulation of a standard design hydrograph at the upstream gauging station Borgharen. The peak discharge of this standard design hydrograph is based on a frequency analysis and its shape is determined by scaling and averaging all flood hydrographs in the dataset. Then it is assumed that the simulated water levels have the same return period as the peak discharge at Borgharen. Until now, this method was not validated. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the influence of hydrograph shape on design water levels on the river Meuse, and to evaluate current and alternative methods to take this shape into account. The five alternative methods are (1) hydrodynamic simulation of all floods in the dataset and apply frequency analysis afterwards on the simulated water levels (the reference), (2) the standard method extended with dependence between the hydrograph shape and the peak discharge, (3) vertical averaging, and two probabilistic methods which combine hydrograph shape statistics at Borgharen with a transformation function that relates local water levels to these hydrograph shape statistics. Within the probabilistic methods one can distinguish explicit (4), which expresses the statistics in probability distribution functions, and implicit (5), which does not use these functions. The influence of hydrograph shape variables on the downstream water level was investigated by means of a correlation analysis. To evaluate the different methods, all methods were applied to a GRADE dataset of 50, 000 years of generated discharge at Borgharen, and the resulting design water levels compared to the reference. In addition to the ability to estimate design water levels, the methods were evaluated on the ability to estimate the design water level reduction of a retention basin (Lob van Gennep). Peak discharge combined with peak curvature were found to be good predictors of the downstream water levels, and were used in the probabilistic methods. The evaluation of methods shows that the currently used standard hydrograph method overestimates the design water levels up to 37 cm with respect to the reference. The present research shows that the current method to determine design water levels can be improved significantly. A simple improvement is to use the vertically averaged design hydrograph with a modified selection interval. More advanced probabilistic methods also improve the estimates, and are potentially valuable in case of retention basins, of which the effectiveness is sensitive to the hydrograph <b>shape.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Blast loading {{events that}} arise from the {{detonation}} of explosives pose a severe threat {{to the lives of}} civilians and military personnel alike. Such dangers typical of a detonation event include {{but are not limited to}} an intense, sudden initial pressure spike, extreme temperatures due to the burning of gases released by the explosive, and damage to the integrity of surrounding structures. It is therefore the purpose of the studies detailed in this manuscript to investigate various methods of mitigating the dangers posed by shock loading, as well as to investigate a novel impact mitigation device. ^ To address the danger presented by high velocity glass fragments generated by windows that have failed due to shock loading, a study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of coated laminated safety glass panels’ ability to contain glass fragments when subject to shock loading over a range of temperature conditions. Using a shock tube apparatus, fully clamped specimens were loaded under room temperature (25 °C), low temperatures (- 10 and 0 °C), and high temperatures (50, 80, 110 °C). For each experiment, the incident and reflected shock wave pressure profiles were recorded and three-dimensional Digital Image Correlation was used to analyze high-speed images and compute the full-field deformation, in-plane strains, and velocities during the blast-loading event. A post-mortem study of the sandwich specimen was performed to investigate the effectiveness of such materials under different temperatures to withstand these shock loads. The composite panel showed great endurance during the blast loading for temperatures from 0 to 80 °C, however was unable to contain glass fragments at - 10 °C and 110 °C. ^ A new system was designed to mitigate the impact forces during a collision using shock loading. The device consists of a cylindrical composite bladder sealed on one end by an inflation valve and on the other by an aluminum sheet of variable thickness. The bladder is pressurized and as an impactor nears the device, it strikes a striker-needle which ruptures the aluminum sheet, thus producing a shockwave just prior to impact. This produced shock wave decelerates the impactor and creates momentum (impulse) opposing that impulse transmitted from the impactor. Drop weight experiments were performed to show the applicability of this anti-shock device in reducing the momentum of the incoming body. A range of variables including needle length, bladder pressure, impact velocity, and drop mass were tested to better understand the processes involved. Time lapse photography coupled with 2 D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used to obtain the striker full field motion data during the drop-weight experiments. It was found that the device effectively mitigates impact for higher impact velocities and for higher bladder pressures, decreasing peak loads during impact by up to 58 % and energy imparted on the structure by 40 %. ^ An experimental study was also conducted to examine the induced pressure from the interaction of a planar shock front and perforated plates under fixed and free-standing boundary conditions using the shock-tube facility. Two series of experiments with variations in the blockage ratio, net <b>hydraulic</b> diameter, <b>shapes,</b> and sizes of the orifices, were conducted. During each experiment, pressure histories caused by the interaction of the incident shock wave with the plates were recorded. During the fluid structure interaction time, the side-view images of the targets were recorded using a single high-speed camera to identify the motion response of each plate configuration. The influence of varying the incident shock wave Mach number on the pressure profile was examined under clamped boundary conditions. The experimental results show that as the blockage ratio of the freestanding perforated plate decreased from 100 % to 65 %, the reflected peak pressure decreased by 26 %, and the maximum impulse imparted to the perforated plate decreased by 33 %. During the fluid-structure interaction process, as the blockage ratio of the freestanding perforated plate decreased from 100 % to 65 %, the plate’s momentum, velocity and kinetic energy decreased by approximately 60 %, 61 %, and 84 % respectively. ^ Finally, investigations were conducted to investigate the performance of different surface roughness (Ra) of 1018 mild low carbon steel panels under blast loading. Specimens were machined to have three different surface finishes of 0. 8, 1. 4, and 5. 0 µm. The shock tube apparatus was utilized to generate controlled blast loadings on simply supported specimens. For each experiment, incident and reflected shock wave pressure profiles were recorded, and three-dimensional Digital Image Correlation was used to analyze high-speed images and compute the full-field deformation, in-plane strains, and velocities during the blast loading event. In addition, another high speed camera was utilized to record the side-view deformation images and this information was used to validate the data obtained from the 3 D stereovision DIC technique. The results indicated that the impulse imparted to the plate decreased as the surface roughness increased from 0. 8 µm to 5. 0 µm. Due to this impulse reduction along with high surface roughness, the plates demonstrated a decrease in back face deflection, in-plane strain and out-of-plane velocity. ...|$|R

A novel compound ribbed surface was designed. The geometry of the compound rib was composed of a first-order transverse rib and a second-order micro-groove superimposed on the primary rib. The existence of second-order structures enhances heat transfer and increases flow friction as well. Therefore, it is highly desirable to optimize the trade-off between the performance of heat transfer enhancement and the effect of friction caused by the ribbed surface. A mathematical model was established to investigate the performance of heat transfer and the characteristics of flow dynamics in single-phase channels with various geometrical configurations of the two-dimensional (2 D) ribs. To fully understand the effects of compound ribs on various flow rates, both laminar flow and turbulent flow were studied with a shear stress transport (SST) model. Numerical simulations were performed with Reynolds number (Re) ranging from 0 to 2, 000 for laminar flow and from 20, 000 to 60, 000 for turbulent flow. Based on the theoretical model and finite volume method, the 2 D governing equations, such as the 2 D continuity, incompressibility, momentum and energy equations were solved by computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software FLUENT. In contrast to the conventional ribs (i. e. symmetrical triangular rib, rectangular rib and semi-circular rib, etc.), the proposed compound rib can promote the reattachment of separated flow to the heat surface, thus shortens the distance from the attachment point to the rib and minimizes the reticulations zone. In the confined space, the application of compound ribs can minimize the pressure drop by reducing the pressure recirculation region at the leeward side of the ribs, as well as improve the performance of heat transfer. Since the configuration of the advanced compound ribs is difficult to machine by conventional methods, ultra-precision raster milling was used to generate these complex surface features. With the advantage of ultra-precision raster milling, a novel one-step machining process for the advanced compound rib is proposed and demonstrated. The present work investigated the principles of cutting strategy for the second-order structures and the cutting conditions that affect the basic features of the structures. Ultra-precision raster milling is usually time-consuming and costly. In order to improve the efficiency of the fabrication the complex compound rib without losing the quality and geometric accuracy of second-order structures, the effect of various machining factors on the quality of micro-groove was systematically studied, such as feed rate, depth of cut and spindle speed. The cutting experiment found that the increase in feed rate greatly improves processing efficiency, but it also results in lower processing quality. The increase in feed rate leads to a rapid increase of cutting force, which aggravates the plastic deformation to the structure. Increased spindle speed can effectively enhance the cross-cutting effect of two adjacent cutting steps on removing material. However, higher spindle speed could cause the plastic deformation of the second-order micro-grooves for the small angle tool cutting. The cutting efficiency can be greatly improved by increasing the cutting depth, which also increases the cutting force on the second-order micro-grooves and results in their deformation. The experiment results suggested that the cutting depth is the most important factor affecting the quality of second-order micro-grooves. To improve the processing efficiency, it is significant to choose the right processing parameters. The effect of diamond cutting tool angle on the form accuracy of the compound rib is also reported. The compound ribs were successfully machined and installed on the cooling channels of micro-heat exchangers. In order to verify the predictions of numerical simulation, cooling experiments were designed and established for various configurations of the ribbed surface with two pitch lengths of the primary rib. The thermal performance was measured by the temperature decreasing rate and the average static temperature. Furthermore, the required pumping power was also measured. Good agreement was found between the simulation and experimental results. The maximum value of heat transfer rate for the optimized compound rib was found to be 2. 8 times greater than that of a smooth surface. Compared to other optimized traditional surfaces which have 2 D transverse ribs and better heat transfer performance as proved by previous researchers, the compound ribs improved the heat transfer rate by more than 6 %. More importantly, by applying the compound ribs the pressure loss was reduced by 18 %. In this thesis, the advanced functional compound ribs with micro-structures are successfully introduced. These ribs will not only enhance the heat transfer performance, but also minimize the pressure drop and further reduce the energy consumption of micro-heat exchangers. The work has provided essential basis for further optimization of the performance of micro-heat exchangers. Department of Industrial and Systems EngineeringPh.
