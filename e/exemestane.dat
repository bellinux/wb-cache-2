25|$|Aromasin (<b>exemestane)</b> for the {{prevention}} of breast cancer and {{the prevention}} of osteoporosis and menopause for women.|$|E
2500|$|Aromatase is {{an enzyme}} which {{converts}} some enones with a six membered ring to aromatic rings - specifically testosterone to estradiol and androstenedione to estrone. [...] Each of these aromatizations involves the oxidation of the C-19 methyl group to formic acid {{to allow for}} the formation of the aromatic system, conversions which are necessary parts of estrogen tumorogenesis in the development of breast cancer and ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women and gynecomastia in men. Aromatase inhibitors like <b>exemestane</b> (which forms a permanent and deactivating bond with the aromatase enzyme) and anastrozole and letrozole (which compete for the enzyme) {{have been shown to be}} more effective than anti-estrogen medications such as tamoxifen likely because they prevent the formation of estradiol.|$|E
50|$|Estrogens {{probably}} reduce <b>exemestane</b> effectiveness: It {{would usually}} be counter-productive {{to reduce the}} body's estrogen synthesis with <b>exemestane</b> and then substitute estrogen with pharmaceuticals.|$|E
50|$|Interim phase III trial {{results in}} 2011 showed that adding {{everolimus}} to <b>exemestane</b> therapy against advanced breast cancer can significantly improve progression-free survival compared with <b>exemestane</b> therapy alone.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{unfavourable}} {{characters of}} 4-OH-A, poor oral bio-availability and unfavourable metabolism, a {{group led by}} E. Di Salle and P. Lombardi at Farmitalia-Carlo Erba (part of Pfizer) started {{working on a new}} selective aromatase inhibitor. The group designed, synthesized and evaluated a new novel steroid, <b>exemestane.</b> <b>Exemestane</b> went through clinical trials in the 1990s and received FDA approval in 1999, marketed as Aromasin. Indication for <b>exemestane</b> is advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women, where the cancer has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. <b>Exemestane</b> is the first oral aromatase inactivator.|$|E
50|$|Interim phase III trial {{results in}} 2011 showed that adding Afinitor (everolimus) to <b>exemestane</b> therapy against {{advanced}} breast cancer can significantly improve progression-free survival compared with <b>exemestane</b> therapy alone.|$|E
50|$|Oral <b>exemestane</b> 25 mg/day for 2-3 {{years of}} {{adjuvant}} therapy was generally {{more effective than}} 5 years of continuous adjuvant tamoxifen {{in the treatment of}} postmenopausal women with early-stage estrogen receptor-positive/unknown receptor status breast in a large well-designed trial. Preliminary data from the open-label TEAM trial comparing <b>exemestane</b> with tamoxifen indicated in 2009 that <b>exemestane</b> 25 mg/day is also effective in the primary adjuvant treatment of early-stage breast cancer in postmenopausal women.|$|E
50|$|A related {{agent is}} <b>exemestane</b> (Aromasin).|$|E
50|$|<b>Exemestane</b> {{is known}} {{chemically}} as 6-methylideneandrosta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione. Like the aromatase inhibitors formestane and atamestane, <b>exemestane</b> is a steroid that is structurally similar to 4-androstenedione, the natural substrate of aromatase. It is {{distinguished from the}} natural substance only by the methylidene group in position 6 and an additional double bond in position 1.|$|E
50|$|Clinical use of steroidal {{aromatase}} inhibitors {{today is}} more or less limited to <b>exemestane.</b> Use of formestane (Lentaron) is very limited and in some countries it is not used anymore. Formestane has been superseded by newer and better inhibitors with better oral availability and fewer side effects, <b>exemestane</b> and the newer generation of nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with other}} {{aromatase}} inhibitors, <b>exemestane</b> {{is on the}} World Anti-Doping Agency's list of prohibited substances.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other steroidal {{aromatase}} inhibitors such as formestane and <b>exemestane,</b> minamestane {{does not}} have androgenic properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Exemestane,</b> a drug {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of breast cancer, is an inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme.|$|E
50|$|The {{estrogen}} suppression {{rate for}} <b>exemestane</b> varies from 35% for estradiol (E2) to 70% for estrone (E1).|$|E
5000|$|Aromasin (<b>exemestane)</b> for the {{prevention}} of breast cancer and {{the prevention}} of osteoporosis and menopause for women.|$|E
5000|$|Irreversible steroidal inhibitors, such as <b>exemestane</b> (Aromasin), forms a {{permanent}} and deactivating {{bond with the}} aromatase enzyme.|$|E
5000|$|Breast {{cancer in}} post-menopausal women with {{advanced}} hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative type cancer, {{in conjunction with}} <b>exemestane</b> (US FDA July 2012) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Exemestane</b> is metabolized by {{the liver}} enzyme CYP3A4. While the CYP3A4 {{inhibitor}} ketoconazole had no {{significant effect on}} <b>exemestane</b> levels in a clinical trial, the strong CYP3A4 inductor rifampicin significantly cut exemenstane levels about in half (AUC −54%, Cmax −41% for a single dose), potentially compromising its effectiveness. Other 3A4 inductors such as carbamazepine and St John's Wort {{are expected to have}} similar effects. The clinical relevance of this effect has not been investigated.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Exemestane</b> is an irreversible, steroidal {{aromatase}} inactivator of type I, structurally {{related to}} the natural substrate 4-androstenedione. It acts as a false substrate for the aromatase enzyme, and is processed to an intermediate that binds irreversibly to the active site of the enzyme causing its inactivation, an effect also known as [...] "suicide inhibition." [...] By being structurally similar to enzyme targets, <b>exemestane</b> permanently binds to the enzymes, preventing them from converting androgen into estrogen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Exemestane</b> is also {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.|$|E
50|$|A Phase III {{trial was}} {{reported}} in 2011, concluding {{that the use of}} <b>exemestane</b> in postmenopausal women at an increased risk for breast cancer reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer. In 4,560 women, after 35 months, the administration of <b>exemestane</b> at a dose of 25 mg/day resulted in a 65% reduction in {{the risk of breast cancer}} compared with placebo; annual incidence rates were 0.19% and 0.55%, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.35; 95% CI 0.18-0.70; p = 0.002).|$|E
50|$|<b>Exemestane</b> is an oral steroidal {{aromatase}} inhibitor {{that is used}} in ER-positive {{breast cancer}} in addition to surgery and/or radiation in post-menopausal women.|$|E
50|$|<b>Exemestane,</b> aromasin, and by {{extension}} all estrogen-like compounds and aromatase inhibitors which mimic estrogen in function will be increased in effect, causing increased estrogen retention and increased drug retention.|$|E
50|$|<b>Exemestane</b> has {{androgenic}} properties {{similarly to}} formestane and can produce androgenic side effects such as acne and weight gain, although these are generally associated with supratherapeutic dosages of the drug.|$|E
5000|$|Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as aminoglutethimide, anastrozole, <b>exemestane,</b> letrozole, and {{testolactone}} {{inhibit the}} production of estrogens from androgens and are used mainly {{in the treatment of}} estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|Pure <b>exemestane</b> is a {{white to}} off-white powder that is soluble in DMSO to at least 20 mg/mL. Optical {{rotation}} αD is +250 to 300° (per g/100 cm³ and decimetre at 589 nm wavelength).|$|E
50|$|In a {{clinical}} study of enzalutamide for -positive {{breast cancer in}} women, enzalutamide was found to decrease serum concentrations of the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and <b>exemestane</b> by 90% and 50%, respectively, which could reduce their effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>exemestane</b> also {{consists of three}} steps, {{as shown in figure}} 3. First off, a Vilsmeier-Haack reagent is prepared by refluxing paraformaldehyde and dimethylamine hydrochloride in isopentanol at a temperature of 131 °C while removing water from the isopentanol using a Dean-Stark separator. The internal temperature of the reagent is then cooled to 10-15 °C, before adding commercially available boldenone (androsta-1,4-dien-17ß-ol-3-one). The reaction mixture is then refluxed for 15 hours to give the 6-methylene derivative, 6-methyleneandrosta-1,4-dien-17ß-ol-3-one. Subsequently, Jones oxidation of the derivative in acetone at -10 °C gives <b>exemestane</b> in 79% yield after recrystalization. A mixture of 65:35 ethanol and water is used for the recrystalization process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Exemestane</b> is {{the only}} steroidal 3rd {{generation}} aromatase inhibitor {{and it has the}} advantage over formestane in being more potent and can be administrated orally. Clinical studies have shown that 25 mg/day causes 97,9% suppression of aromatase.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} side effects (more than 10% of patients) are hot flashes and sweating, which {{are typical of}} {{estrogen}} deficiency as caused by <b>exemestane,</b> and also insomnia, headache, and joint pain. Nausea and fatigue are mainly observed in patients with advanced breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Exemestane</b> is {{indicated}} for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen-receptor positive early breast cancer {{who have received}} {{two to three years}} of tamoxifen and are switched to it for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy.US FDA approval was in October 2005.|$|E
50|$|<b>Exemestane</b> {{has been}} used in doping to raise luteinizing hormone (LH) and {{follicle}} stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, which in turn increases the ratio of male over female sexual hormones and so improves performance. The drug also counteracts gynecomastia as well as fat and water retention following excessive aromatase production due to testosterone doping.|$|E
50|$|Such {{conditions}} may {{be treated with}} drugs with antiestrogen actions, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen and clomifene, estrogen receptor antagonists such as fulvestrant, aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole and <b>exemestane,</b> gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues such as leuprolide and cetrorelix, and/or other antigonadotropins such as danazol, gestrinone, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone acetate.|$|E
50|$|Vorozole is an {{imidazole}} based competitive inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme. It underwent clinical {{testing for}} evaluation {{for use as}} an antineoplastic agent; however it was withdrawn from testing when no difference was detected in the duration of median survival {{as compared to the}} progestational agent megestrol acetate and research instead focused on the other third generation aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, letrozole and <b>exemestane.</b> The enzyme is selective.|$|E
50|$|SMEDDS in {{research}} or development include formulations {{of the drugs}} anethole trithione, oridonin, curcumin, vinpocetine, tacrolimus,Mitotane, berberine hydrochloride, nobiletin, piroxicam, anti-malaria drugs beta-Artemether and halofantrine, anti-HIV drug UC 781, nimodipine, <b>exemestane,</b> anti-cancer drugs 9-nitrocamptothecin (9-NC) paclitaxel, and seocalcitol, alprostadil (intraurethral use), probucol, itraconazole, fenofibrate, acyclovir, simvastatin, xibornol, silymarin, alpha-asarone, enilconazole, puerarin (an isoflavone found in Pueraria lobata), atorvastatin, heparin, carvedilol, ketoconazole, gentamicin, labrasol, flurbiprofen, celecoxib, danazol, cyclosporine, and idebenone.|$|E
50|$|Aromatase inhibitors, which {{stop the}} {{production}} of estrogen in postmenopausal women, have become useful {{in the management of}} patients with breast cancer whose lesion was found to be estrogen receptor positive. Inhibitors that are in current clinical use include anastrozole, <b>exemestane,</b> and letrozole. Aromatase inhibitors are also beginning to be prescribed to men on testosterone replacement therapy as a way to keep estrogen levels from spiking once doses of testosterone are introduced to their systems.|$|E
