40|$|The <b>homogeniser</b> is {{a machine}} that is mostly used to change the {{appearance}} and rheological properties of a fluid {{by means of a}} high pressure radial gap. It can be implemented to kill off harmful bacteria and organisms as well as reduce the size of individual components or particles to increase the shelf live of many products. The <b>homogeniser</b> can be used to release useful organic materials from within cells or microbes. The <b>homogeniser</b> can be found in small scale production and large scale production. The small scale production <b>homogeniser</b> allows smaller gap sizes but is restricted to lower flow rates in relation to the larger scale <b>homogeniser.</b> The primary aim of this thesis is to determine optimum geometries for the small-scale high-pressure <b>homogeniser</b> in the disruption of anaerobic microbes from waste water sludge to release organic material to produce methane with maize crop. It is believed that breaking apart microbial walls of microbes in the sludge can release organic material that can further increase methane production and also reduce digester volume. In this case, the waste water sludge with microbes was implemented with a mixture of dry maize silage to produce methane by means of anaerobic conditions. The <b>homogeniser</b> is used to break up tough microbes in secondary waste water sludge to reduce digester volume and anaerobic methane production waiting times. Geometries of the <b>homogeniser</b> and prototypes were generated using Gambit 2. 3. Pressure, velocity and flow fields were estimated and analysed using Fluent 6. 3. The model was estimated by means of a stationary microbe model. Shear forces on microbes were analysed for various positions along the streamline of flow and compared. The <b>homogeniser</b> setup with the highest peak shear forces was used as an optimum <b>homogeniser</b> setup. The initial <b>homogeniser</b> model was replicated from the original experimental <b>homogeniser</b> in the lab. Model simulations were validated from empirical formulae from other works.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} homogenisation techniques {{for reducing the}} size of calcium alginate beads during the microencapsulation of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium longum. Bead sizes were reduced using three homogenisation techniques including Ultra-Turrax benchtop <b>homogeniser,</b> Avestin Inc. piston <b>homogeniser</b> and Silverson mixer for various durations, number of passes and pressures. The survival of probiotic organisms during homogenisation was also investigated. The smallest beads (39. 2 μm) were created using the Ultra-Turrax benchtop <b>homogeniser</b> at 13500 rpm for 4 min. There was {{a significant reduction in}} the survival of each organism (< 5. 5 %) using the Silverson mixer. However, homogenisation using Ultra-Turrax and Avestin Inc. homogenisers resulted in better survival at 64. 4 % and 47. 7 %, respectively.

Extension of the study to consider the effect of cell characteristics, including the growth rate, size and shape, illustrated the dominant effect of the growth phase. The improved {{disruption of}} bacterial cultures in the logarithmic phase with respect to stationary phase cultures was confirmed by an increased dependence of actively growing cultures on the operating pressure.

40|$|Membrane {{emulsification}} is {{a process}} of injecting a pure dispersed phase or pre-emulsion through a microporous membrane into the continuous phase. As a result of the immiscibility of the two phases, droplets of the dispersed phase are formed at the outlets of membrane pores. The droplets formed in the process are removed from the membrane surface by applying cross-flow or stirring of the continuous phase or using a dynamic (rotating or vibrating) membrane. The most commonly used membrane for emulsification is the Shirasu Porous Glass (SPG) membrane, fabricated through spinodal decomposition in a melt consisting of Japanese volcanic ash (Shirasu), boric acid and calcium carbonate. Microsieve membranes are increasingly popular as an alternative to highly tortuous glass and ceramic membranes. Microsieves are usually fabricated from nickel by photolithography and electroplating or they can be manufactured from silicon nitride via Reactive Ion Etching (RIE). An advantage of microsieves compared to the SPG membrane is in much higher transmembrane fluxes and higher tolerance to fouling by the emulsion ingredients due to the existence of short, straight through pores. Unlike conventional emulsification devices such as high-pressure valve <b>homogenisers</b> and rotor-stator devices, membrane emulsification devices permit a precise control over the mean pore size over a wide range and during the process insignificant amount of energy is dissipated as heat. The drop size is primarily determined by the pore size, but it depends also on other parameters, such as membrane wettability, emulsion formulation, shear stress on the membrane surface, transmembrane pressure, etc...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we present the Conjugate Refractive Reflective <b>Homogeniser</b> (CRRH) {{to be used in}} a 500 X Cassegrain {{photovoltaic}} concentrator. The CRRH is a dielectric crossed v-trough lined with a reflective film whilst maintaining an air gap between them. This air gap between the two surfaces helps in trapping the scattered light from the refractive geometry and ensures both total internal reflection (TIR) and standard reflection of the escaped rays. A 10 - 42 % drop in optical efficiency has been shown to occur due to varying the surface roughness of the <b>homogeniser</b> in these ray trace simulations for the Cassegrain set up. The CRRH increased the overall optical efficiency by a maximum of 7. 75 % in comparison to that of a standard refractive <b>homogeniser</b> simulated within the same concentrator system. The acceptance angle and flux distribution of these homogenisers was also investigated. The simple shape of the CRRH ensures easy manufacturing and produces a relatively uniform irradiance distribution upon the receiver. The theoretical benefit of the CRRH is also validated via practical measurements.

40|$|AbstractJPSA Laser’s new Fly’s Eye Beam Homogenizer {{converts}} the characteristically non-uniform beam of a UV Excimer laser into {{a homogeneous}} beam with 95 % uniformity while utilizing > 80 % {{of the laser}} power. This long working distance single element array easily adapts to most commercial excimer lasers, and offers optimum price/performance ratio (single element for lowest cost and lowest beam loss). The JPSA Fly’s Eye Beam Homogenizer’s long working distance — typically between 1 – 2 meters — provides a beam size ranging from 8 mm to 1. 5 cm. It is easily re-imaged due to the long working distance and slow optical F-number. Excimer laser beams are not perfectly uniform in intensity over {{the area of the}} beam and therefore only a portion of the area of the beam is usable for high-uniformity materials processing. In some cases, only the most uniform section or “filet” of the beam will be selected for use, and the non-uniform section of the laser beam will be discarded. Due to the premium price associated with UV photons, high beam utilisation in many cases is a key economic factor. Beam shaping optics and beam <b>homogenisers</b> can be employed to shape the beam and simultaneously make the laser energy uniform so that the maximum amount of the available laser power can be used. The resultant uniform, large area beam can then be subdivided using near-field imaging to project complex patterns onto a part or make simultaneous multiple laser ablations, a key advantage of UV Excimer lasers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report was to {{investigate}} the safety assessment of emulsification techniques and the variety of emulsion-based nanostructures (EBNS) that can be obtained and subsequently used in the food industry. Environmental issues will not be addressed. The number of nanotechnology applications is increasing and it is expected that the food industry will be the newest field in which nanotechnology will be applied. A conservative size definition of 500 nm was chosen for risk assessment purposes. Cells are capable of taking up nanostructures of up to 500 nm in size and nanostructures can be engineered with certain properties that could mimic effects of smaller sized nanostructures. Devices to produce emulsions and EBNS are already used in the food industry (<b>homogenisers)</b> while other methods are still being developed which are more efficient (low-energy methods). A large variety of nanostructures can be obtained with emulsification techniques such as simple emulsions, lipid nanostructures, solid nanostructures etc. Very {{little is known about the}} effects of nanostructures on the gastrointestinal tract. Nanostructures in the body mostly accumulate in the liver and kidneys where the effects are the most pronounced. Surface properties are very important as they can determine the fate, function and possible risks of nanostructures. More research is needed in which other non-metallic and non-carbon-based nanostructures are (orally) tested. Recommendations for a food nanostructure-specific risk assessment include the goal of the nanostructure (intended or unintended exposure), consideration of physicochemical properties relevant to food nanostructures (e. g. solubility), the history of safe use and a minimum amount of testing to ensure safety. A risk assessment paradigm is proposed which incorporates these recommendations...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} three {{different}} drugs for different applications {{have been investigated}} for their physical features. The production of these nanosuspensions was performed by high pressure homogenisation. The particle size analyses have been performed by laser diffraction and photon correlation spectroscopy. Additional characterisation have been done by zeta potential investigations and x-ray-diffraction. The drug Tarazepide, a CCK 1 receptor antagonist, used for gastric disorders, was created as nanosuspension for i. v. administration. Different production opportunities were investigated to achieve a sterile nanosuspension. Especially the mean particle size, particle size distribution and physical long term stability were investigated. Budesonid is a corticosteroid mainly used in asthma therapy. With this drug the possibilities to create nanosuspensions for inhalation was investigated. Therefor the drug was composed with additives generally used for inhalation and the feature when nebulising the nanosuspension. To determine the increase of the dissolution velocity and increase of saturation solubility of nanosuspensions versus microsuspensions in general budesonid nano- and micorsuspensions were investigated on these features. They have been investigated after different time points of storage. Budesonid was also taken to investigate the impact of different homogenisation pressure applied to the suspension and the achieved particle size due to different pressures. Not only different homogenization pressures had been applied but also various models of high pressure <b>homogenisers</b> have been applied. Buparvaquone is a naphtoquinone, that is an effective treatment against the pathogen Cryptosporidium parvum. It is applied orally, and for this application created as nanosuspension. Buparvaquone was created as nanosuspension incorporated into hydrogels to further increase the mucoadhesive properties of the drug. The particle size and physical long-term stability of nanosuspensions and the nanosuspension-hydrogel systems were investigated. Also the surface charge was determined by zeta potential analysis.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the drop break-up process in milk homogenisers. This was done by measurements and calculations of the flow fields in the gap region and by visualisation of drops being broken up. To make visualisation and measurements possible, two scale models of a <b>homogeniser</b> gap were developed. The full-scale model was a direct copy of the gap in a production-scale <b>homogeniser,</b> but with optical access. Normal operational homogenisation pressures could be tested, and drops down to 5 µm in diameter could be visualised. The second model was scaled-up about 100 times ensuring that the relevant dimensionless groups were kept constant, so that the same factors governed the drop break-up process. The scaled-up model was made of transparent plastic and was used for both velocity field measurements and drop visualisation. From these measurements it was concluded that the drops did not break up in the entrance of the gap. Larger drops were elongated to some extent and smaller ones remained spherical. Not much happens in the gap itself. The velocity profile is very flat throughout the gap in a production-scale <b>homogeniser.</b> In a pilot-scale <b>homogeniser</b> the boundary layers have time to grow and the velocity profile is almost developed at the gap exit. The growing shear layers seem to have a limited effect on the drops. During passage through the gap small drops will have time to relax back to their spherical shape, while large ones will leave the gap with almost the same aspect ratio as when they entered it. This study shows that drop break-up takes place in the turbulent jet at the gap outlet. The flow velocity measurements show a very unsteady jet breaking down faster than a jet in a free liquid. Depending on the geometry of the chamber at the gap outlet, the jet can attach to either of the 45 -degree walls and become a wall jet. The turbulence in the jet is very high, with turbulence intensities of 50 - 100 %. Indications were found that flow structures of the size of, or slightly smaller than, the gap height, have very high intensities. Drop deformation experiments and theoretical analyses show that the eddies breaking up the drops range in size from much larger than, to just smaller than, the drop. The larger eddies deform the drop viscously by the velocity gradient created by the eddy. The smaller eddies deform the drop by fluid inertia. The critical phase of the drop break-up process is the initial deformation. If the drop is deformed to an aspect ratio of 3 - 5, the drop is then very quickly elongated into one or more filaments which may be bent, coiled and further deformed before they break up into many small droplets...|$|E

In the last section of this chapter, SPG membranes are compared with conventional <b>homogenisers</b> and microfluidic drop generators in terms of production rate, droplet size uniformity, and applied shear stresses. The second section deals with the fabrication of SPG membrane by spinodal decomposition in Na 2 O– CaO–Al 2 O 3 –B 2 O 3 –SiO 2 type glass and morphological, mechanical, and hydrodynamic properties of SPG membrane. This chapter also covers modification of surface charge, contact angle and porosity of SPG membrane using different physical and chemical methods, such as deposition of silica nanoparticles onto membrane surface, coating with silicon resin, filling the pores with solvent-responsive polymer chains and chemical modification with silane coupling agents. The fourth section is focused on the effects of physical properties of the dispersed and continuous phase, operating parameters and membrane properties on the droplet size in direct and premix SPG membrane emulsification.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, diode lasers have {{established}} {{in a number of}} fields of application in research and industry. Such light sources feature a high degree of efficiency as well as a long duration of life. Thanks to steady further developments, modern diode lasers exhibit an output power in the range of some watts and have become a cost-efficient alternative solution for other types of lasers. In addition, diodes are suitable sources for pumping solid state lasers. However, due to the functional principle and the setup, diode lasers exhibit an elliptical beam profile, resulting in a limited focusability. In addition, both the short and the long axis of diode lasers propagate at different angles of divergence. As a consequence, astigmatism can occur. In order to overcome these disadvantages, several techniques for shaping diode laser beams are in hand. For example, anamorphic lenses, consisting of an assembly of cylindrical lenses or gradient-index elements, can be used for shaping a circular beam profile. For this purpose, anamorphic micro-lenses can be applied moreover. Further, anamorphic prisms or prism pairs allow converting circular laser beams from elliptical diode laser irradiation. Such a shaping is also achieved by combinations of aspheric, cylindric and toric micro-lenses and macroscopic lenses. Other techniques for generating circular beam profiles are based on micro-optical elements such as crossed micro step-mirrors in order to shape the short and the long axis successively. This method can be used for fibre-coupling applications. In addition, micro-mirrors are used to assemble beam-shaping devices where the functional principle is comparable to imaging micro-lens beam <b>homogenisers.</b> The incoming beam is divided into a number of partial beams by a series of tilted plane micro-mirrors. Subsequently, the partial beams are recomposed by a micro-mirror recombiner. A similar technique is based on a stepped mirror. Here, only the short axis is divided in subunits, leading to a rectangular beam profile after further reflection. This rectangular beam profile is then shaped by macroscopic lenses. Instead of micro-mirrors, diffractive optical elements or arrays of right-angled prisms can be used furthermore for shaping diode laser beams. Beam shaping can also be achieved using two offset plane mirrors. Due to its simple design, this technique presents a costefficient solution...|$|R

Therefore, this research {{was carried out in}} order to analyze and determine the most optimum condition for water in oil emulsion stability. In liquid membrane technology, the stable emulsion must be demulsified to separate the receiving phase in the final process. Several parameters for emulsion stability were studied such as emulsification speed, emulsification time, concentration of surfactant and viscosity and type of diluents. The demulsification process of W/O emulsion using electrical field also investigated. The emulsion consists of kerosene as organic phase, sulphuric acid as internal phase and sorbitan monoolete (SPAN 80) as a surfactant. Effects of various parameters such as concentration of surfactant and stripping phase, voltage and frequency of electrical field and <b>homogeniser</b> speed on demulsification process of W/O emulsion were studied. The demulsification of emulsion were measured based on percentage of emulsion breakage. The results showed that increasing surfactant concentration will produce a stable emulsion that hard to be demulsified.

Increase of voltage and frequency will greatly accelerate the demulsification process.

40|$|Denne oppgaven har gått ut på å optimalisere en analysemetode for metylkvikksølv (MeHg) i hår, basert på en metode for å bestemme metylkvikksølv i {{sediment}} og biologiske prøver uten å forringe analysekvaliteten. Metoden bestod av speciering med ekstraksjoner, dekomponering ved hjelp av mikrobølgeteknikk, og analyse med kalddamp atomabsorpsjonsspektroskopi. Spesieringsdelen av analysen, som bestod av ekstraksjoner med hydrogenbromidsyre, toluen og L-cysteinløsning ble forenklet. Fire ekstraksjoner ble redusert til tre og sentrifugering av prøvene etter hver ekstraksjon ble utelatt. Variansanalyse av resultater fra modifisering av metoden gav ingen signifikant forskjell på opprinnelig metode og modifisert metode. Modifisert metode gav god nøyaktighet basert på analyse av sertifisert referansemateriale. Den gav en presisjon på 8 % uttrykt som relativt standard avvik, det er like god presisjon som opprinnelig metode tidligere har vist. Da sertifisert referansemateriale hadde lavere standardavvik enn hårprøver er det sannsynligvis mulig å forbedre presisjonen ytterligere ved bedre <b>homogenisering</b> av hårprøvene. Kvantifiseringsgrense for modifisert metode ble bestemt til 0, 015 mg MeHg / kg, det er lavere enn for opprinnelig metode. Metylkvikksølv ble funnet å være stabilt i L-cysteinløsning i opp til 20 dager etter ekstraksjoner. Hårprøvene som ble analysert kom fra personer som hadde registrert antall måltider av saltvannsfisk og ferskvannsfisk per måned, antall amalgamfyllinger i tenner, alder og bosted. Det ble bestemt innhold av metylkvikksølv i 38 hårprøver og total kvikksølv i 24 hårprøver. De laveste resultatene ble funnet i prøver fra veganere, her var metylkvikksølv konsentrasjonen under kvantifiseringsgrensen for to prøver. De høyeste resultatene ble funnet i prøver fra mennesker som spiser fisk flere ganger om dagen. Det høyeste resultatet på 6, 18 mg MeHg / kg ligger under antatt grense for skade på grunn av kvikksølv. Lineærregresjon av analyseresultater gav en god sammenheng mellom innhold av total kvikksølv og metylkvikksølv i hårprøven. Enkelte prøver avviker imidlertid fra denne sammenhengen, og flere analyser må gjøres før noen konklusjon om sammenheng mellom total kvikksølv og metylkvikksølv kan gjøres. En bedre rutine for innhenting og behandling av hårprøver er også nødvendig. Det er observert en sammenheng mellom høyt inntak av fisk og høyt innhold av metylkvikksølv i hår. Denne sammenhengen kunne imidlertid ikke bekreftes statistisk med det tallmaterialet som ble tilgjengelig ved analysene. Det trengs flere forsøkspersoner med høyt innhold av fisk i kosten, og det bør vurderes om man skal finne forsøkspersoner fra et område der metylkvikksølvinnholdet i fisk er kartlagt, eller fiskens trofiske nivå er kjent. ract The {{aim of this}} master thesis was {{to optimize}} an analytic method for methyl mercury (MeHg) in hair, based on a method for methyl mercury in sediments and biological samples without impairing {{the quality of the}} analysis. The method consists of speciation by extraction, decomposition with microwaves and analysis by cold vapour atomic absorption spectroscopy. The speciation part, consisting of extractions with hydrobromic acid, toluene and L-cystein solution was simplified, four extractions were reduced to three and centrifugation after each extraction was omitted. Analysis of variance of the results from the modification of the method gave {{no significant difference between the}} original method and the modified method. The modified method gave good accuracy based on analysis of certified reference material. The precision given as relative standard deviation was 8 %, as good as the original method in previous analysis. As certified reference material had lower standard deviation than the samples, the precision can probably be improved by better homogenisation of the hair samples. The limit of quantification for modified method was 0, 015 mg MeHg / kg, which is lower than the original method. Methyl mercury was found to be stable in L-cystein solution up to 20 days after the extractions. Hair samples were retrieved from people who also reported number of salt water fish and fresh water fish per month, number of amalgam fillings in teeth, age and place of residence. Methyl mercury was determined for 38 hair samples and total mercury was determined for 24 samples. The lowest results were found in hair samples from vegans, the methyl mercury concentration in two these samples were below the limit of quantification. The highest results were found in samples from people who eat fish several times a day. The highest result of 6, 18 mg MeHg / kg is below the risk level for the first symptoms of methyl mercury poisoning. Linear regression of the results gave a good fit for total mercury versus methyl mercury. Some samples do however differ from the average relation between total mercury and methyl mercury. More tests are necessary before any conclusion can be made. A better routine for collection of samples is necessary. A connection between high intake of fish and high concentration of methyl mercury was observed, but the connection could not be verified statistically with the present results. More results are needed, especially for the higher level of fish intake. Preferably from an area where the methyl mercury content of the fish is mapped or at least the trophic level of the fish is known...|$|R
40|$|Emulsions are dispersions of one {{liquid in}} another that are {{commonly}} used in various products, and methods such as high-pressure <b>homogenisers</b> and colloid mills are used to form emulsions. The size and size distribution of emulsion droplets are important for the final product properties and thus need to be controlled. Rapid coalescence of droplets during emulsification increases droplet size and widens the size distribution, and therefore needs to be prevented. To increase stability of emulsions, emulsifiers are added to adsorb at the oil-water interface before droplets collide. The time allowed for emulsifier adsorption is typically {{in the range of}} sub-milliseconds to seconds and to optimise emulsification processes, emulsifier adsorption and coalescence stability need to be measured in this time-scale, for which the microfluidic methods described in this thesis were developed. Chapter 2 provides an overview of existing literature on cross-flow microfluidic emulsification. The effects of various parameters such as microfluidic design, shear forces, and interfacial tension forces on droplet formation and the resulting droplet size are discussed, as well as the use of microfluidics to produce food-grade emulsions. Based on this evaluation, the methods to elucidate interfacial tension and coalescence stability are chosen, and these are presented in the next chapters. To measure emulsifier adsorption in the sub-millisecond time-scale, a tensiometric method was developed using a cross-flow microfluidic Y-junction, which is described  in Chapter 3. This method is based on the relation between droplet size and interfacial tension at the moment of droplet formation, which {{is referred to as the}} acting interfacial tension. The acting interfacial tension of a system with hexadecane as the dispersed phase and sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS, a model surfactant) solutions as the continuous phase was successfully measured for droplet formation times ranging from 0. 4 to 9. 4 milliseconds and with high expansion rates (100 - 2000 s- 1). Comparison of these results with data from a drop tensiometer (a conventional, static, and supra-second time-scale method) indicates that mass transport in the microfluidic Y-junction is fast and probably not limited by diffusion. Emulsifier mass transport conditions were further investigated in Chapter 4. The continuous phase viscosity and velocity were systematically varied and the effect on the acting interfacial tension in presence of water-soluble SDS was measured. We found that the acting interfacial tension was independent of the continuous phase viscosity, but was inversely dependent on continuous phase velocity. Both aspects led us to conclude that convective emulsifier transport in the continuous phase determines the acting interfacial tension in the Y-junction. When using oil-soluble surfactant Span 20 (dissolved in hexadecane), the acting interfacial tension also decreased with increasing continuous phase velocity, and we therefore concluded that convection also dominated mass transport of emulsifiers dissolved in the to-be-dispersed phase. The Y-junction method was used in Chapter 5 to elucidate the effect of the dispersed phase viscosity on adsorption of the food-grade emulsifiers Tween 20 (dissolved in the continuous water phase) and Span 20 (dissolved in the dispersed oil phase). A reduction in dispersed phase viscosity sped up adsorption of Tween 20, probably because the shorter hydrocarbon made intercalation of the hydrophobic surfactant tail at the interface easier. Dispersed phase viscosity had an even greater effect on adsorption of Span 20 because convective transport towards the interface was increased. Next to interfacial tension, also coalescence can be measured with microfluidics and a microfluidic collision channel was used in Chapter 6 to measure emulsion coalescence stability shortly after droplet formation under flow. Coalescence of emulsions stabilised with proteins was measured at various concentrations, pH values, and adsorption times. We found that protein concentrations just below the concentration needed for monolayer surface coverage may be used effectively. β-lactoglobulin-stabilised emulsions were most stable. Emulsions stabilised with whey protein isolate (with as main component β-lactoglobulin), were less stable and when these proteins were oxidised, this led to reduced stability, therewith indicating that also the oxidative state of proteins needs to be considered in emulsion formulation. The relevance of our work for microfluidic research and industrial emulsification processes is discussed in Chapter 7. Microfluidic devices can be used to study emulsion formation and stability under conditions relevant to industrial emulsification processes; at short time-scales and with convective mass transport. In this thesis we used various food-grade ingredients, and with that application in that field has come closer. We expect that the findings on emulsions can also be applied on foams. With the discussed microfluidic devices different aspects that are important for emulsion formation can be decoupled: for example interfacial tension during droplet formation and emulsion coalescence stability. Furthermore, microfluidic methods are available to for example gain insight in emulsion interface mobility and emulsion storage stability, and we envision that all these microfluidic methods will lead to faster ingredient screening, lower ingredient usage, and more energy efficient emulsion production...|$|R

40|$|The {{tensions}} {{produced in}} {{the wall of a}} rigid, thin-walled, liquid-filled sphere as it moves with an axisymmetric straining flow are examined. This problem has not been previously addressed. A generalised correlation for the maximum wall tension, expressed in dimensionless form as a Weber number (We), is developed in terms of the acceleration number (Ac) and Reynolds number (Re) of the straining flow. At low Reynolds number We is dominated by viscous forces, while inertial forces due to internal pressure gradients caused by sphere acceleration dominate at higher Re. The generalised correlation has been used to examine the case of a typical yeast cell (a thin-walled, liquid-filled sphere) passing through a typical high-pressure <b>homogeniser</b> (a straining-flow device). At 56 MPa homogenising pressure, a 6 mu m yeast cell experiences tensions in the inertially dominated regime (Re = 100). The correlation gives We = 0. 206, corresponding to a maximum wall tension of 8 Nm(- 1). This is equivalent to an applied compressive force of 150 mu N and compares favourably with the force required to break yeast cells under compressive micromanipulation (40 - 90 mu N). Inertial forces may therefore be an important and previously unrecognised. mechanism of microbial cell disruption during high-pressure homogenisation. Further work is required to examine the likelihood of cell deformation in the high-strain-rate short-residence-time environment of the <b>homogeniser,</b> and the effect that such deformation may have on the contribution of inertial forces to disruption.

Simulated optical efficiencies of 84. 82 – 81. 89 % over a range of ± 1 ° tracking error and 55. 49 % at a tracking error of ± 1. 5 ° were obtained. The final singular module measures 169 mm in height and 230 mm in width (not including structural components such as cover glass). The primary reflector dish has a focal length of 200 mm and is a focal with the secondary inverse reflector which has a focal length of 70 mm. The transparent homogenising optic has a height of 70 mm, an entry aperture of 30 × 30 mm and an output aperture of 10 × 10 mm to match the solar cell.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find models for {{turbulent}} fragmenting forces in the high-pressure <b>homogeniser</b> from data available in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) turbulence models. In addition to the more common RANS k-epsilon turbulence models, a Multi-scale k-epsilon model was tested since experimental investigations of the geometry imply large differences in behaviour between turbulent eddies of different length-scales. Empiric models for the driving hydrodynamic factors for turbulent fragmentation using the extra information given by multi-scale simulations were developed. These models are shown to give a more reasonable approximation of local fragmentation than models based on the previously used RANS k-epsilon models when comparing to hydrodynamic measurements in an experimental model.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. The conjugate refractive reflective <b>homogeniser</b> (CRRH) is experimentally tested within a cassegrain concentrator of geometrical concentration ratio 500 × and its power output compared to the theoretical predictions of a 7. 76 % increase. I–V traces are taken at various angles of incidence and experimental results showed a maximum of 4. 5 % increase in power output using the CRRH instead of its purely refractive counterpart. The CRRH utilises both total internal reflection (TIR) within its core refractive medium (sylguard) and an outer reflective film (with an air gap between) to direct more rays towards the receiver. The reflective film captures scattered refracted light which is caused by non-ideal surface finishes of the refractive medium. The CRRH prototype utilises a 3 D printed support which is thermally tested, withstanding temperatures of up to 60 °C but deforming at > 100 °C. A maximum temperature of 226. 3 °C was reached within the closed system at the focal spot of the concentrated light. The material properties are presented, in particular the transmittance of sylguard 184 is shown {{to be dependent on}} thickness but not significantly on temperature. Utilising both TIR and standard reflection can be applied to other geometries other than the <b>homogeniser</b> presented here. This could be a simple but effective method to increase the power of many concentrator photovoltaics.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to improve the {{viability}} of probiotic organisms within freeze-dried yoghurt during processing and storage. Initially, probiotic organisms including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium spp. were incorporated in reconstituted skim milk and freeze-dried in order to select the most robust strains for use in further experiments The viability of B. infantis 17930 and L. rhamnosus GG was reduced by 0. 07 log, while that of L. casei 1520 and B. longum 1941 was reduced by 0. 28 and 0. 39 log, respectively. The probiotic organisms selected for further experiments were L. acidophilus 33200, L. casei 279, L. rhamnosus GG and B. longum 536. The effectiveness of adding cryoprotectants and prebiotics in improving the viability of the selected probiotic organisms was investigated. There was a 7 % improvement in the viability of L. casei 1520 when cryoprotectant 'UnipectineTM RS 150 ' was added at 2. 5 % (w/v). The addition of the prebiotic 'Raftilose P 95 at 1. 5 % (w/v) to yoghurt improved the viability of the combined selected probiotic organisms by 1. 42 log during four weeks of storage at 4 °C. Microencapsulation of probiotic organisms was assessed to determine whether further improvements in viability were possible. Microencapsulation with calciumalginate using the emulsion technique was found to improve the viability of the combined selected probiotic organisms by 0. 31 log in freeze-dried yoghurt stored at 21 C. Further studies were carried out to compare the extrusion technique with the emulsion technique. It was found that the viability of the probiotic organism was 1. 0 log 10 CFU/g higher using the emulsion technique after freeze-drying. Coating with poly-L-lysine or chitosan further improved the survival of the probiotic organisms by 0. 03 and 0. 07 log 10 cfu/g in yoghurt during 4 weeks of storage at 4 ºC. The survival of probiotic organisms in yoghurt stored at 4 ºC was highest (8. 69 log 10 cfu/g) in beads coated with chitosan. In freeze-dried yoghurt, coating with poly-L-lysine or chitosan improved survival of probiotic organisms by 0. 2 and 0. 4 log 10 cfu/g in freezedried yoghurt during 16 weeks of storage at 21 C. The survival of probiotic organisms in freeze-dried yoghurt stored at 4 ºC was highest (8. 47 log 10 cfu/g) in beads coated with chitosan. Although microencapsulation was effective in improving the viability of probiotic organisms in freeze-dried yoghurt, the calcium-alginate beads were too large and influenced the texture of the yoghurt. Consequently, further work was carried out to identify an effective technique for reducing bead-size during microencapsulation of probiotic organisms. The diameters of calcium-alginate beads were reduced by forming emulsions using homogenisation with Ultra-Turrax benchtop <b>homogeniser,</b> Avestin Inc. Piston <b>homogeniser</b> and Silverson mixer. The smallest beads were formed using the Ultra-Turrax benchtop <b>homogeniser</b> with a modal diameter of 56 Î¼m. The counts of L. casei 279 after microencapsulation using the Ultra-Turrax benchtop <b>homogeniser</b> at 8000 rpm for 2 min were not adversely affected as the population was 8. 8 log 10 cfu/g. However, the count of microencapsulated B. longum 536 using the Silverson mixer was 6. 3 log 10 cfu/g. Overall, small beads containing viable probiotic organisms were created when an emulsion formed by homogenisation during microencapsulation. It is recommended that probiotic organisms present in freeze-dried yoghurt should be microencapsulated to improve their viability. The emulsion technique should be used and the emulsion. The sodium alginate/probiotic and oil mixture should be homogenised using the Ultra-Turrax Benchtop mixer at 8000 rpm for 2 minutes to effectively reduce bead size. Ideally, calcium-alginate beads should be coated in chitosan to provide maximum protection. Cryoprotectants should also be added to the yoghurt to provide probiotic organisms with additional protection during freeze-drying...|$|E
40|$|Nano-emulsions are a {{centre of}} {{attention}} for many industrial applications in different {{fields such as}} pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food and agriculture due to their interesting physical properties such as transparency, larger surface area to volume ratio and long-term physical stability. This PhD project focuses on the preparation of stable nano-emulsions using different emulsification methods with an attempt to find the optimum formulation to produce stable nano-emulsions for food and healthcare applications. The emulsification methods studied in this project were rotor-stator <b>homogeniser</b> (Ultra-Turrax), Phase Inversion Temperature (PIT), dead-end and cross-flow membrane emulsification methods. The model system soybean oil/water/Brij 97 was used to investigate the emulsification methods. However, in the case of two membrane emulsification methods, it was decided to use Tween series surfactants as Brij 97 didn't work for our experiments. Our study showed that stable nano-emulsions containing 10 % (w/w) oil phase ratio can be produced by <b>Homogeniser,</b> PIT and dead-end membrane emulsification methods with droplet sizes in the range of 9 - 90 nm depending on the employed method, surfactant concentration and various experimental conditions. Cross-flow emulsification method failed to produce stable nano-emulsions in this study. PIT method yielded the smallest drop sizes in the range of 9 – 19 nm and lowest energy consumption (200 - 280 J g- 1). However, for producing stable nano-emulsions by this method, the minimum amount of surfactant required were found to be 10. 5 % (w/w). Dead-end membrane emulsification was also found to be a promising method for producing stable nano-emulsions with using surfactant concentration as low as 4 % (w/w) in oil, bearing also in mind that Tween series surfactants are more biocompatible than Brij 97. The only drawback for this method is its higher energy consumption than PIT method as Ultra-Turrax was used to prepare the premix. If a more energy efficient method for mixing the emulsion components is employed, this method could be a more suitable option than PIT method for food and healthcare applications. Nevertheless, PIT method could still be considered as the favourable choice when shear sensitive materials are used...|$|E
