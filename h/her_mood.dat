5|$|Despite her {{relative}} inexperience, Leigh {{was chosen}} to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when <b>her</b> <b>mood</b> rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event. It {{was the first time}} Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.|$|E
5|$|Kaja Bordevich Ballo (1988– March 28, 2008) was a {{university}} {{student in the}} French town of Nice; her father was Olav Gunnar Ballo, {{a member of the}} Norwegian Parliament. On March 28, 2008 Kaja Ballo took the personality test run by the Church of Scientology, and committed suicide later the same day. Family and friends stated that Ballo was happy prior to taking the test, and that <b>her</b> <b>mood</b> dramatically shifted after receiving the results. She committed suicide hours after getting the results of the test back; Ballo jumped from the fourth floor of her dorm room. In addition to a note, her family found the Scientology personality test among her belongings. French police investigated connections between Scientology and Ballo's death, and interviewed two leaders of the organization in France. Prosecutors stated in December 2008 that they were unable to establish a causative link between the Scientology test and Ballo's death.|$|E

As late as June 1975, David Rigler wrote that Genie continued to make significant strides in every field which the scientists were testing, and Curtiss' contemporaneous accounts expressed some optimism about Genie's social development. Nonetheless, even by mid-1975 most social interactions with her remained abnormal in quality. The scientists wrote that, while her overall demeanor and interactions with others had significantly improved, many aspects of her behavior remained characteristic of an unsocialized person.|$|E

He served as a spokesperson for the family during an intense period of their grief. He described her as [...] "happy and bubbly", prior to taking the Scientology test. Heljar Ballo stated, [...] "We can only relate the facts, that she was doing well in France, was happy and had many good friends, and that she took this test." ...|$|E

Betts first created the song as an experiment, {{to test whether}} or not he could write a song that could be played with just two fingers, in honor of Gypsy jazz guitar virtuoso Django Reinhardt, who played with two left fingers due to severe burns. When his baby daughter Jessica entered the room and began bouncing around to the melody, Betts attempted to capture <b>her</b> <b>mood</b> with the song. Dudek created the song's bridge when Betts became frustrated with the piece. Dudek was disappointed when he was told he would only be recording the acoustic guitar opening, as Betts felt Dudek performing the harmonies to both [...] "Ramblin' Man" [...] and [...] "Jessica" [...] would lead critics to assume {{he was a member of}} the band.

The lack of intellectual society there and his wife's hostility towards him drove Gian Gastone {{into the arms of}} alcohol. Gian Gastone, unable to rein in his disgust, abandoned Anna Maria Franziska for Paris after one year in Reichstadt. When he arrived there, an enraged Cosimo, who had explicitly told his son not to leave Anna Maria Franziksa without his prior consent, ordered him back to Reichstadt. Anna Maria Franziska made an effort to welcome him back; however, <b>her</b> <b>mood</b> turned sour when Gian Gastone brought up the prospect of wintering in Prague.

500|$|No Doubt {{decided to}} work with hip hop {{production}} duo The Neptunes {{as a sort of}} [...] "cultural collision". [...] Lead singer Gwen Stefani wanted to write a high-spirited and celebratory song about the positive things in her life, so they wrote an optimistic club song. [...] The word [...] was a slang term used mostly in the San Francisco Bay Area and other parts of California to mean [...] "very". [...] Having toured in the Bay Area, Stefani borrowed the term to describe <b>her</b> <b>mood.</b> [...] Stefani wanted to use the word dance in a chorus, so she decided to end each line of [...] "Hella Good"'s chorus with the phrase [...] "keep on dancing".

She began taking medications to stabilize <b>her</b> <b>mood.</b> She wrote: I can never shake my belief that I was being recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful than I could have imagined. Whether it was the CIA or some other organization I will never know. As long as I am alive, these forces will never stop hounding me. Chang committed suicide on November 9, 2004. A memorial service was held in China by Nanking Massacre survivors coinciding with her funeral in Los Altos, California.

500|$|As an {{artificial}} construct, Cortana has no physical form or being. Cortana always {{speaks with a}} smooth female voice, and she can communicate through comm systems and project a holographic image of herself from appropriate projectors, such as Holotanks, and appears holographically as a woman. Cortana is said to resemble her creator, Dr. Catherine Halsey, with a similar attitude [...] "only unchecked by military and social protocol". In Halo: The Fall of Reach, Cortana is described as slender, with close-cropped hair and a skin hue that varies from navy blue to lavender, depending on [...] <b>her</b> <b>mood.</b> Numbers and symbols flash across her form when she is thinking. In Halo 4 Cortana has become more human in appearance with more subtle additions being added to her character model such as a gap being visible between her front teeth. Cortana was played by actress Mackenzie Mason using advanced facial rendering technology to capture movements in her face while speaking to add a more human look.|$|E

It was a very kind of open project, where whatever she felt like recording at that time was what we'd work on. It was based on how she felt, <b>her</b> <b>mood,</b> and also her listening to the demos that writers would give us." [...] With Swivel, she experimented with horns, drums, guitars and percussion instruments. Mostly inspired by the Fela! sessions, Swivel began to formulate beats using their own recordings and those from Fela! The project was moved to KMA Studios for {{a week and a half}} because Roc the Mic was not large enough.

500|$|... finally {{reveals a}} side of Mariah we don't see that often — her true self. The Mariah we usually see and hear is a glossy one. Psychologists might say her affect is 'off' — meaning her {{gestures}} and facial expressions don't match <b>her</b> <b>mood.</b> There's a reason for that, as she explains on 'Side Effects', which is the emotional abuse she says she suffered during her marriage to music mogul Tommy Mottola. Mariah, who is usually quite guarded, has alluded to the subject in songs like 'Petals', but never has she gone into such detail as she does on 'Side Effects', in which she refers to the marriage as a 'private hell that we built'. Even though it's been 11 years since they split up, she sings in a lower register that she's still 'wakin' up scared some nights ... dreaming about the violent times'. Her emotional scars left her 'a little protective ... a little defensive ... a little depressed', which makes her 'fake a smile' as she 'deal with the side effects'. Even though it features Young Jeezy, {{it sounds like a}} rock power ballad.|$|E
500|$|During the 1820s and 1830s, Sherwood wrote a {{great many}} tracts for the poor; like her novels for the middle class, they [...] "taught the lessons of {{personal}} endurance, reliance on Providence, and acceptance of one's earthly status." [...] Emphasizing individual experience and one's personal relationship with God, they discouraged readers from attributing their successes or failures to [...] "larger economic and political forces." [...] In this, they resembled the Cheap Repository Tracts, {{many of which were}} written by Hannah More. [...] As Linda Peterson, a scholar of nineteenth-century women's literature, argues, Sherwood's tracts use a Biblical [...] "interpretative frame" [...] in order to highlight the fleetingness of earthly things. For example, in A Drive in the Coach through the Streets of London (1819), Julia is granted the privilege of shopping with her mother only if she will [...] "behave wisely in the streets" [...] and [...] "not give [...] mind to self-pleasing." [...] Of course, she cannot keep this promise and she eagerly peeks in at every store window and begs her mother to buy her everything she sees. [...] Her mother therefore allows her to select one item from every shop. Julia, ecstatic, chooses, among other things, blue satin boots, a penknife, and a new hat with flowers, until the pair reach the undertaker's shop. There <b>her</b> <b>mood</b> droops considerably and she realizes the moral of the lesson, recited by her mother, as she picks out a coffin: [...] "but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth" [...] (1 Timothy 5:6).|$|E
