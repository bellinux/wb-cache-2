5|$|A {{group of}} 17people, {{initially}} considered missing, rode {{out the storm}} on the offshore Mackerel Island. Onshore, officials closed a portion of Highway 1 {{as well as other}} roads in the area. Ahead of the storm, hundreds of residents in older structures and mobile <b>homes,</b> <b>as</b> well as an aborigine village near Onslow, were ordered to evacuate to safer locations. Five iron mines were closed during the storm's passage, forcing the 1,500workers to return home. The disruptions from the cyclone affected about 340,000tonnes of lost production. About 800,000barrels of lost oil production resulted from closed offshore platforms. Oil fields reopened by 14April.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, the non-Serb {{civilian}} {{population in the}} village and the surrounding area was persecuted. They were forced to flee their <b>homes,</b> <b>as</b> they would have been imprisoned, physically abused or killed if they did not. After the war, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) charged high-ranking SAO SBWS and Serbian officials, including Slobodan Milošević and Goran Hadžić, with war crimes committed in Dalj. The killings were extensively covered by German media leading to forming of a public opinion in support of Croatia. By the end of 1991, Germany adopted support for diplomatic recognition of Croatia as its policy and duty.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} the networked <b>home</b> <b>as</b> both a social institution and a technological construction. While the concept of networks is not new to family studies, the new technologies of information and communication are requiring us to look at the <b>home</b> <b>as</b> an intersection point of sociology and technology. Fundamental to our analysis is the concept of <b>home</b> <b>as</b> living space that unfolds into a collection of multiple centers – <b>home</b> <b>as</b> activity center, entertainment center, work center, information center, communication center, learning center and shopping center. In our analysis, the living space is subdivided structurally into social, physical and technological spaces in which the centers are embedded as organic elements. The integration of the centers with the living space model is fundamental to understanding the <b>home</b> <b>as</b> a networked <b>home...</b>|$|R

5|$|As one road, NY14 and NY414 travel down Franklin Street, {{the main}} {{thoroughfare}} of Watkins Glen. The routes pass by several blocks of <b>homes</b> <b>as</b> {{they follow the}} western base of the ravine and meet {{the east end of}} NY329, which ascends the side of the valley to serve Watkins Glen State Park. NY414 continues to follow NY14 to Watkins Glen's central business district, where NY414 splits from the overlap to travel east at an intersection that also acts as the eastern terminus of NY409. From this point north, NY14 and NY414 follow opposite sides of Seneca Lake, with NY414 running along the east lake shore.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1590s, the full-length portrait came into vogue and artistic patrons among the nobles began to add galleries of such paintings to their <b>homes</b> <b>as</b> a form of cultural ostentation. Peake {{was one of those who}} met the demand. He was also among the earliest English painters to explore the full-length individual or group portrait with active figures placed in a natural landscape, a style of painting that became fashionable in England. As principal painter to Prince Henry, Peake seems to have been charged with showing his patron as a dashing young warrior.|$|E
5|$|Category1 storms usually cause no {{significant}} structural damage to most well-constructed permanent structures; however, they can topple unanchored mobile <b>homes,</b> <b>as</b> well as uproot or snap weak trees. Poorly attached roof shingles or tiles can blow off. Coastal flooding and pier damage are {{often associated with}} Category1 storms. Power outages are typically widespread to extensive, sometimes lasting several days. Even though it is the least intense type of hurricane, the storm can still produce widespread damage and can be a life-threatening storm.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study examined the}} meanings ascribed to the construct “home ” by 208 youths defined by mainstream society as “homeless”. Youth narratives {{on the topic of}} home ranged across a continuum with <b>home</b> <b>as</b> state at one end (i. e., home is a state of mind, comprised of one’s friends) and <b>home</b> <b>as</b> place at the other (i. e., <b>home</b> <b>as</b> a physical dwelling). Youths employing the former meanings had typically been on the street for longer periods and identified with counterculture-type ideologies. For youths who defined <b>home</b> <b>as</b> place, <b>home</b> was constructed in direct opposition to street experiences. For both of these groups, control emerged as a central theme in their narratives. The implications of these findings for engaging youth and goal setting regarding exiting the streets are described...|$|R

5|$|For {{the next}} , the route passes by open fields as it overlooks {{the lake to}} the east. The route {{gradually}} descends back into the valley as it heads further northward into the town of Fleming. Once in Fleming, NY38 runs along the lakeshore and serves {{a long line of}} lakeside <b>homes</b> <b>as</b> it passes by a series of fields to the west. The amount of development along the route begins to increase at the northern end of the lake in the hamlet of Melrose Park, where NY38 meets NY437 by way of a traffic circle. At this point, NY437 becomes the primary lakeside highway while NY38 becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads northwest as Lake Avenue toward the city of Auburn.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} caused {{flooding in}} the state of Veracruz. Thousands of people were forced from their <b>homes</b> <b>as</b> rivers rose, including upwards of 30,000fleeing for shelter after the Tuxpan River exceeded its bank. About 8,000residents of the city of Álamo were rendered homeless. Flooding in Poza Rica forced the rescue of dozens of people from their cars and homes. Several homes in the city were swept away, while debris such as tree branches and trash blocked water runoff. Water, mudslides, and rocks blocked numerous roads in the area. In combination with Hurricane Kristy in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 50,000people were left homeless in Mexico. At least 20fatalities were attributed to Debby.|$|E
5|$|In Buckingham Township, PA 263 {{becomes a}} four-lane {{undivided}} road passes {{a mix of}} farmland and <b>homes</b> <b>as</b> {{it comes to the}} community of Furlong. Here, the road intersects Edison Furlong Road/Forest Grove Road and forms the border between Doylestown Township to the west and Buckingham Township to the east. At the intersection with the eastern terminus of PA 313 (Swamp Road), the route fully enters Buckingham Township again and turns northeast past a mix of farms and woods with some residences. Farther to the northeast, the route reaches the community of Buckingham and crosses PA 413 (Durham Road).|$|E

5|$|In February 2015, at the {{conclusion}} of the Croatia–Serbia genocide case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) dismissed a Serbian lawsuit which alleged that Operation Storm constituted genocide, ruling that Croatia did not have the specific intent to exterminate the country's Serb minority, though it reaffirmed that serious crimes against Serb civilians had taken place. The court also found that the HV left accessible escape routes for civilians. According to the judgement, Serb civilians fleeing their <b>homes,</b> <b>as</b> well as those remaining in UN protected areas, were subject to various forms of harassment by both the HV and Croatian civilians. On 8 August, a refugee column was shelled.|$|E
5|$|In late October 1813, Hurshid Pasha {{declared}} a general amnesty for the rebels that had survived, though Karađorđe and some senior Serbian religious leaders were specifically exempted. Many rebel leaders accepted Hurshid Pasha's offer of amnesty {{and agreed to}} lay down their arms, the most notable of these being Miloš Obrenović, the rebel commander in Užice. A large number of Serb refugees subsequently returned to their <b>homes,</b> <b>as</b> did many of the Muslims that had been displaced in the fighting.|$|E

5|$|NY391 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY277 (Herman Hill Road) in North Boston, a hamlet within {{the town of}} Boston. It heads to the northwest as Boston State Road, passing by suburban <b>homes</b> <b>as</b> it approaches the Southern Expressway (US219). The two highways meet {{by way of a}} diamond interchange. West of the exit, NY391's surroundings become more rural as it enters the town of Hamburg, where it passes by open fields and a handful of houses.|$|E
5|$|NY410 {{begins at}} a rural {{intersection}} with NY26 {{in the town}} of Denmark. The two-lane route heads eastward from the junction, winding to the north and south across open, rolling terrain with several cultivated fields. After , the highway meets County Route19 (CR19, named East Road) and turns to the northeast toward the village of Castorland. The open fields gradually give way to <b>homes</b> <b>as</b> NY410 enters the village limits as Main Street. The route passes {{through the center of the}} village, serving four lightly developed residential blocks before crossing the Mohawk, Adirondack and Northern Railroad at the northeastern edge of the community. At the rail crossing, the highway passes south of what was once the New York Central Railroad's Castorland passenger station.|$|E
5|$|NY424 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY380 {{in the town}} of Stockton. The route headed northeast, passing by forests and <b>homes</b> <b>as</b> it ascended Stockton Hill. Here, it intersected with Nelson Hill Road, a short alternate route of NY424. After reaching the top of the hill, NY424 became known as Stockton Hill Road and went through fields {{on its way to the}} village of Cassadaga. Once in the village limits, the highway intersected Putnam Road (CR71) in an area of Cassadaga known as Burnhams. NY424 continued on into the heart of the village, passing by homes and the southern end of Lower Lake before coming to an end at an intersection with NY60.|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores home-making in {{a context}} of {{movement}} and exclusion. I examine how Guatemalan female migrants make their home after migration to the United States, both locally and transnationally. I employ the concept of home to focus on emplacement and groundedness in the lives of migrants. <b>Home</b> is theorized <b>as</b> a ‘lived locality’ and as consisting of the categories of <b>home</b> <b>as</b> origin and <b>home</b> <b>as</b> everyday lived experience. These overlapping categories are broken apart by migration. I argue that migrants’ feelings of belonging remain geared towards Guatemala while their everyday lives mostly play out in the United States. The connection with Guatemala is maintained through transnational practices, the formation of a Guatemalan migrant community and the assertion of a Guatemalan identity. <b>Home</b> <b>as</b> the place where one belongs, remains separate of <b>home</b> <b>as</b> everyday life as a result of exclusion and marginalization. Migrants’ creative cross-border home-making is a strategy to maintain a home in both categories, albeit not in the same territory...|$|R

The highway heads towards the southwest, passing <b>homes</b> <b>as</b> Sentinel Road. At the {{intersection}} with Mill Pond Road, NY73 passes a small pond, crossing over an associated creek. For that short time, the highway takes on a more southerly direction, mainly to the southeast. The surroundings of the highway remain the same as NY73 leaves Lake Placid via Cascade Road.|$|E
5|$|The Heirs of Fate saga, {{released}} after {{the rest of}} the DLC, focuses around the game's Child units. Two separate versions of the Avatar's child Kana, one male and one female, each journey with members of each version's cast to discover why a group of mysterious soldiers attacked their homes. It is revealed that they were never truly in their <b>homes,</b> <b>as</b> Anankos had transported them to Valla and attempted to trick them into killing each other. However, Azura's son, Shigure, broke the illusion and banded the two Kanas' armies together, only to leave them to face Anankos alone with the hidden verse of his mother's song. However, the army finds a way back, and helps to take down Anankos for one final time.|$|E
5|$|The easternmost {{portion of}} NY117 in Katonah {{passed through a}} {{historic}} district containing several homes {{dating back to the}} late 19th century. Following the construction of nearby I-684 in 1968, this segment of NY117 became a truck route between the Interstate Highway and industrial areas along NY117 south of Katonah. While the Saw Mill River Parkway would have provided an alternate route to I-684 from NY117, commercial traffic was prohibited from using the highway. The trucks that used NY117 would shake the historic <b>homes</b> <b>as</b> it passed through the hamlet, causing small amounts of damage to the structures. A study analyzing the issue of truck traffic along NY117 in Katonah began in 1976 {{at the request of the}} town of Bedford.|$|E
