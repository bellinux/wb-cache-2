The aim {{of this study is to}} know the effect of addition of <b>double</b> <b>coupling</b> agent of maleic anhydride (MA) and maleic anhydride polyethylene (MAPE) on quality of produced composites. In this research, the ratio of MA and MAPE that applied are 1 : 1; 1 : 2 and 2 : 1. The hot press method was used in order to form these composites. The composite formation process was perfomed at medium temperature of 170 oC for 30 minutes. After pressed manually and heated at these temperature later composite samples were cooled to room temperature naturally, and finally composites were tested to know its mechanical properties of tensile strength and bending strength as well as water absorption capacity. The results showed that the simultant addition of MA and MAPE as <b>double</b> <b>coupling</b> agent can improve the quality of the produced composites. The amount of MAPE that is added in MA coupling agent affected both the value of the tensile strength and bonding strength of the composites. The similar characterstics also occurred on property of water absorption on immersed composite. By addition of the MAPE and MA together then both coupling agents are increasing bonding adhesion between matrix and filler becomes stronger and tighter. The highest value of tensile strength of 5. 75 MPa was obtained on the composite ratio of MA:MAPE= 1 : 2. While the highest value of bending strength of 4. 1 MPa was also obtained on the composite with the same ratio.

40|$|Summary. The use of {{a moment}} tensor {{formulation}} in source mechanism inversions is becoming more widespread. However, this method does not yield results that correspond to a double-couple source, which is still the preferred source model. This is because the <b>double</b> <b>couple</b> is characterized by extra constraints on the general symmetric moment tensor. A method is presented of imposing these non-linear constraints while retaining the linear nature of the inversion. An application of this result shows (1) that the doublecouple model fits the body-wave data {{as well as more}} general models if one explicitly considers the fewer number of free parameters in the <b>double</b> <b>couple</b> and (2) that the principal axes of the moment tensor of the uncon-strained model do nor necessarily correspond to the P and T axes of the <b>double</b> <b>couple...</b>|$|R

The <b>double</b> <b>couple</b> and ‘mixed quadrupole’ are both quadrupole sources but, unlike the <b>double</b> <b>couple,</b> the P and S waves from a ‘mixed quadrupole’ have different source histories.

The displacement fields are investigated numerically, {{in order to establish}} a criterion for estimating the minimum range for applying far-field theory results to the total displacement field. The chosen criterion is the ratio of the far-field peak amplitude, which is a function of source rise or duration time, to the static displacement, which is a near-field phenomenon.
