40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to critical {{voices on the}} issue of organisational responses to drugs and employee drug use. It does so by exploring some of the symbolism residing at the heart of organisations’ relations with drugs and drug taking. Our focus is recent media coverage of, and organisational responses to, the UK tabloid media’s exposé of fashion supermodel <b>Kate</b> <b>Moss’s</b> cocaine use. We use this case to explore symbolic relationships between drugs, sex and femininity, and organisation. Through highlighting these symbolic connections we question further the rationality of organisational responses to the ‘spectre’ of drugs and the issue of employee drug use. We conclude by suggesting that workforce drug testing regimes might be fruitfully seen as mechanisms for scapegoating and sacrifice {{in order to protect the}} organizational moral order. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to critical {{voices on the}} issue of organisational responses to employee drug use. It does so by exploring symbolic readings of organisations' relations with drugs and drug-taking. Our focus is recent coverage of, and organisational responses to, the UK tabloid media's exposé of fashion supermodel <b>Kate</b> <b>Moss's</b> alleged cocaine use. We consider that the celebrity endorsement in this particular case highlights the ambiguities created by the symbolic associations between the organisation and the 'image' projected by the celebrity. Overall, we use this case to explore symbolic relationships between drugs, sex, femininity and organisation. Through highlighting these connections, we question further the rationality of organisational responses to employee drug use and, utilising Derrida's (1981) extension of Plato's notion of the pharmakon, consider whether workforce drug testing might be fruitfully seen as a symbolic mechanism for scapegoating and sacrifice {{in order to protect the}} organisation's (masculine) moral order. 15 page(s...|$|R
