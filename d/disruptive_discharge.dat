40|$|Inadvertent {{failure of}} gas {{insulated}} system {{such as high}} voltage GIS is traced to a freak mechanism, in particle induced breakdown. While conducting (metallic) particles cause a direct breakdown of the gaseous insulation due to {{a high degree of}} non-uniformity of electric fields surrounding them, dielectric (insulation) particles give rise to <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharges</b> due to surface charges acquired by them in the strongly divergent electric field in their vicinity. The deleterious effects of particles are too well known to be enumerated. Since it is not always possible to fabricate GIS without parasitic floating and fixed particles, and scavenging the particles bordering on microscopic dimensions is very difficult, study of the particle aided breakdown study acquires particular significance in GIS. The effect of particles of either kind being the same; the reduction in the dielectric strength of the system, every effort should be made to either prevent outages due to them or workout means of stabilising the system in their presence.

Thus, if we may trust {{this form}} of experiment, the {{negative}} small ball has a decided advantage in facilitating <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharge</b> over the positive small ball in some gases, as in carbonic acid gas and coal gas (1399.), whilst in others that conclusion seems more doubtful; and in others, again, there seems a probability that the positive small ball may be superior.

It is apparently very different in its nature {{to any of the}} former modes {{of discharge}} (1319.), but, as the result is the same, may be of great importance in illustrating, not merely the nature of discharge itself, but also of what we call the electric current. It often, as before observed, in cases of brush and glow (1440. 1535.), joins its effect to that of <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharge,</b> to complete the act of neutralization amongst the electric forces.|$|E

The brush was small and very difficult to obtain; the ramifications were simple, and stretched out from each other, diverging very much. The light was exceedingly feeble, a perfectly dark room being required for its observation. When a few solid particles, as of dust or silk, were in the liquid, the brush was produced with much greater facility.|$|E

A high temporal and spatial resolution camera, based on an infra-red 128 x 128 pixels focal plane array detector has been used to perform the measurements. Comparing the power profile for the same discharge as inferred from two images taken just before the disruption and at the thermal quench, it is possible to assess that: the radial exponential decay of the power flowing onto the limiter shows in both cases two different e-folding lengths, a short one (of the order of 2 mm or even less, in <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharges)</b> in the first few mm of the SOL depth and a larger one (1. 5 cm) deeper in the SOL, An energy balance has been performed based on thermal images of both the limiter and the nearby wall during the thermal quench.

The first operations {{with the new}} ITER-like wall constitute {{a good opportunity to}} test the development of new predictors from scratch and the related methodologies. These methodologies have been based on the Advanced Predictor Of DISruptions (APODIS) architecture. APODIS is a real-time disruption predictor that is in operation in the JET real-time network. Balanced and unbalanced datasets have been used to develop realtime predictors from scratch. The discharges have been used in chronological order. Also, different criteria to decide when to re-train a predictor are discussed. Best results are obtained by applying a hybrid method (balanced/unbalanced datasets) for training and with the criterion of re-training after every missed alarm. The predictors have been tested off-line with all the <b>discharges</b> (disruptive/ non <b>disruptive)</b> corresponding to the first three JET ITER-like wall campaigns.

40|$|This {{work can}} be framed in the purview of hot plasma magnetically {{confined}} in the configuration called Reversed Field Pinch. This configuration shares some physical aspects with astrophysical plasma phenomena, such as the solar flares. The common element that lies behind these two systems is the magnetic relaxation, which allows the plasma to reach a more favourable state in terms of energy minimisation. In the tokamak magnetic configuration for plasma confinement a phenomenon called disruption has been interpreted as a critical relaxation event that tends to reorganise the magnetic configuration {{in order to reach}} the minimum energy state but instead leads the plasma to a sudden loss of confinement and current. In the Reversed Field Pinch, phenomena similar to disruptions, called fast terminations, have been recently recorded but never systematically analysed. In this thesis, the phenomenology of fast terminations in the Reversed Field Pinch configuration is systematically studied {{for the first time in}} the RFX-mod device. Some particular <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharges</b> are presented and typical quench times, magnetic instability behaviour and some statistical analysis are shown. The main operational parameters bounded by disruptions are investigated. Finally, an analysis of the halo currents in a RFX-mod Reversed Field Pinch disruption is presented...|$|R

The {{occurrence}} of dark discharge {{in any case}} shows at how low a tension <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharge</b> may occur (1548,), and indicates that {{the light of the}} ultimate brush or spark is in no relation to the intensity required (1368. 1370.). So to speak, the discharge begins in darkness, and the light is a mere consequence of the quantity which, after discharge has commenced, flows to that spot and there finds its most facile passage (1418. 1435.). As an illustration of the growth generally of discharge, I may remark that, in the experiments on the transition in oxygen of the discharge from spark to brush (1518.), every spark was immediately preceded by a short brush.|$|E

A copper boiler 3 feet in {{diameter}} was insulated and electrified, but so feebly, that dissipation by brushes or <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharge</b> did not occur at its edges or projecting parts in a sensible degree. A brass ball, 2 inches {{in diameter}}, suspended by a clean white silk thread, was brought towards it, and it was found that, if the ball was held {{for a second or}} two near any part of the charged surface of the boiler, at such distance (two inches more or less) as not to receive any direct charge from it, it became itself charged, although insulated the whole time; and its electricity was the reverse of that of the boiler.|$|E

When {{decomposition}} {{happens in}} a fluid electrolyte, I do not suppose that all the molecules in the same sectional plane (1634.) part with and transfer their electrified particles or elements at once. Probably the discharge force for that plane is summed up on {{one or a few}} particles, which decomposing, travelling and recombining, restore the balance of forces, much {{as in the case of}} spark <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharge</b> (1406.); for as those molecules resulting from particles which have just transferred power must by their position (1705.) be less favourably circumstanced than others, so there must be some which are most favourably disposed, and these, by giving way first, will for the time lower the tension and produce discharge.|$|E
40|$|Vacuum interrupters {{occasionally}} show unexpected (late) breakdown after current interruption. As a result, the interrupter conducts briefly, {{carrying a}} high-frequency current {{due to the}} discharge of various (stray) capacitances {{in the vicinity of}} the interrupter. Thanks to the capability of vacuum interrupters to interrupt such high-frequency current, the conduction period is normally very short (normally in the order of 10 µs). In the discussion around the assessment of such late breakdowns (often termed nonsustained <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharges</b> in the standardization literature) regarding the possibility of generation of overvoltage in capacitive circuits, the duration of the conductive period is an important parameter. Experiments were carried out, in which discharges of various single frequencies (72 kHz- 1. 1 MHz) were generated following breakdown (spontaneous breakdowns as well as prestrike) of two commercial vacuum breakers. It is demonstrated that the duration of the discharge depends strongly on the discharge current frequency. At higher frequencies, the duration of the discharge tends to be shorter than at lower frequencies. For practical circuits, allowing simultaneous discharge from various circuit parts, it was observed that the highest frequency component determines the arc duration. Duration of up to 15 µs was observed. This duration is too short to allow significant overvoltages to develop in standard capacitive power delivery circuits...|$|R
40|$|In the {{international}} IEC standards for medium and HV switching devices no distinction in test requirements is made between switching devices with different arc-quenching media, like SF 6, oil and vacuum. This {{had led to}} the situation that due to the different technology of arc interruption applied, {{various aspects of the}} prescribed test-procedures have a different weight in terms of severity for various types of breakers. Additional test-requirements and interpretations that are specific to vacuum switching devices have been formulated commonly by the joint major test laboratories. In this contribution, the background and practical application of several procedures, now generally adopted by certifying test-laboratories, regarding the peculiarities of vacuum switching devices are elucidated. Because the vacuum switching device has an excellent capability to interrupt current of high frequency, the main part of this contribution will be related to the consequences for test procedures of this aspect that is not encountered in SF 6 or oil breakers. In particular, the judgment of non-sustained <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharges,</b> multiple re-ignition and virtual current chopping in test-circuits is addressed.

The {{words of}} this {{description}} are long, {{but there is}} nothing in the act or the forces on which it depends to prevent the discharge being instantaneous, as far as we can estimate and measure it. The consideration of time is, however, important in several points of view (1418.), and in reference to <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharge,</b> it seemed from theory far more probable that it might be detected in a brush than in a spark; for in a brush, the particles in the line through which the discharge passes are in very different states as to intensity, and the discharge is already complete in its act at the root of the brush, before the particles at the extremity of the ramifications have yet attained their maximum intensity.|$|E
6000|$|... 1447. To sum {{up these}} {{considerations}} respecting {{the character and}} condition of the brush, I may state {{that it is a}} spark to air; a diffusion of electric force to matter, not by conduction, but <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharge,</b> a dilute spark which, passing to very badly conducting matter, frequently discharges but {{a small portion of the}} power stored up in the conductor; for as the air charged reacts on the conductor, whilst the conductor, by loss of electricity, sinks in its force (1435.), the discharge quickly ceases, until by the dispersion of the charged air and the renewal of the excited conditions of the conductor, circumstances have risen up to their first effective condition, again to cause discharge, and again to fall and rise, ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1618. A {{current is}} {{produced}} both by excitement and discharge; and whatsoever the {{variation of the}} two general causes may be, the effect remains the same. Thus excitement may occur in many ways, as by friction, chemical action, influence of heat, change of condition, induction, &c.; and discharge has the forms of conduction, electrolyzation, <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharge,</b> and convection; yet the current connected with these actions, when it occurs, appears in all cases to be the same. This constancy {{in the character of}} the current, notwithstanding the particular and great variations which may be made in the mode of its occurrence, is exceedingly striking and important; and its investigation and development promise to supply the most open and advantageous road to a true and intimate {{understanding of the nature of}} electrical forces.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of accurate real time disruption predictors is a pre-requisite to any mitigation action. 'Accurate real time prediction' {{has to be}} understood in terms of high success rate, low rates of false alarms as well as an early recognition of an incoming disruption. Only approximate theoretical models of disruptions exist and they do not reliably cope with the disruption issues. Therefore, this article deals with data-driven predictors with a view on ITER and DEMO. A review of existing prediction techniques, from both physics and engineering points of view, is provided. All these methods have to use large training datasets to develop successful predictors. However, ITER or DEMO cannot wait for hundreds of disruptions to have a reliable predictor. So far, the attempts to extrapolate predictors between different tokamaks have not shown satisfactory results. Moreover, {{it is not clear how}} valid this approach can be between present devices and ITER/ DEMO, due to the differences in their respective scales and possibly underlying physics. So, this article analyses the requirements to create adaptive predictors from scratch to learn from the data of an individual machine from the beginning of operation. A particular algorithm based on probabilistic classifiers has been developed and it has been applied to the database of the three first ITER-like wall experimental campaigns of JET (1036 non-disruptive and 201 <b>disruptive</b> <b>discharges).</b> The predictions show a success rate of 94 %, a false alarm rate of 4. 21 % and an average warning time of 654 ms. The average probability interval about the reliability and accuracy of all the individual predictions is 0. 811 ± 0. 189. It should also be mentioned that a very limited number of signals is required by the predictor, an important point particularly at the beginning of the operation of new devices...|$|R
