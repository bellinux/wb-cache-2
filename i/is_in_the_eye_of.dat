25|$|According to this theory, coolness is a subjective, dynamic, socially-constructed trait, {{such that}} coolness <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> the beholder. People {{perceive}} things (e.g., other people, products or brands) {{to be cool}} based on an inference of “autonomy”. That is, something {{is perceived to be}} cool when it follows its own motivations. However, this theory proposes that the level of autonomy that leads to coolness is constrained - inappropriate levels of autonomy, such that the autonomy is too high or opposes a legitimate norm, do not lead to perceptions of coolness. The level of autonomy considered appropriate is influenced by individual difference variables. For example, people who think of societal institutions and authority as unjust or repressive perceive coolness at higher levels of autonomy than those who are less critical of social norms and authority.|$|E

2500|$|Common wisdom {{tells us}} that beauty <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> the beholder. [...] Sircello’s {{philosophy}} runs counter to this maxim. [...] He maintained that beauty is objective in a very particular way. [...] His starting point is the recognition that when a judgment of beauty is made {{there is something about}} the object that is thought to be beautiful. [...] For example, if an alpine sunset seen as beautiful, {{this is due to the}} quality of light expressed in the sunset, or perhaps because of the intense depth of the vista, or because of some other attribute of the scene that stands out as exceptional in some way. [...] Beauty resides for Sircello in the possession by objects, scenes, actions, and so on of qualities to a very high degree. [...] Qualities of lack, deficiency or defect are excluded from this because these qualities are not enjoyed qualities.|$|E
