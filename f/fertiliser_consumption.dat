India is the second largest consumer of fertilisers in the world after China, consuming about 26. 5 million tonnes. However, average intensity of fertiliser use in India remains much lower than most {{countries in the world}} but is highly skewed, with wide inter-regional, inter-state, and inter-district variations. By 2020, fertiliser demand in the country is projected to increase to about 41. 6 million tones and is expected to grow at a faster rate in eastern and southern region compared with north and west. To meet the increasing fertiliser requirements of the country, a conducive and stable policy environment, availability of raw materials, capital resources, and price incentives will play a critical role.

40|$|<b>Fertiliser</b> <b>consumption</b> {{and food}} grains {{production}} in the Asia have increased considerably during the last 3 decades. However, in tropical Asia, crop yields in general are far too low. The population in tropical Asia is growing at a fast rate resulting in higher need of food, fibre, fodder and fuel. The region houses {{a large number of}} the poor who suffer from the serious problem of food shortage and mal-nutrition. There is, therefore, an urgent need to increase food grain {{production in the}} region. Among the various means available, proper use of fertilisers can help in achieving the goal. The paper discusses the fertiliser use in rainfed upland conditions of the tropical Asian region. The constraints to increased use of fertilisers are listed. Asia has 1264. 7 million hectares of agricultural land out of a global total of 4846. 1 m. ha. Likewise, the arable land and land under perennial crops in the Asia cover 472. 5 m. ha {{out of a total of}} 1450. 8 m. ha in the world. About 12. 6 % of the agricultural area in the Asia is irrigated and that is much higher than in other continents. Therefore, the percentage of rainfed area to agricultural area in the Asia is 87. 4, whereas this percentage is 98. 8, 95. 3, 98. 4 and 92. 3 in Africa, North & Central America, South America, respectively.

40|$|The European Union Renewable Energy Directive 2009 / 28 /EC (RED) {{has adopted}} climate change {{assessment}} {{as one of}} the environmental criteria used to evaluate the level of sustainability by indicating the impact values for every phase of the biofuel chain. This paper shows the results of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cultivation of sunflower for biodiesel production in Tuscany, Italy. In the five case studies, the GHG emissions of sunflower cultivation exceed the default value (18 g [CO 2 eq] MJ - 1) indicated by the RED. This is mainly due to diesel consumption and emissions from nitrogen fertilisers that are on average 180 % and 255 % higher than the reference values, respectively. GHG emissions allocation among sunflower biodiesel and co-products was made according to energy content principle. Only the biodiesel from sunflower cultivated in the two most efficient farms achieved a GHG saving with respect to conventional diesel (36 %) that made it possible to fulfil the RED's requirements. From these results, it seems that the observance of such requirements on GHG emissions for sunflower biodiesel cultivation phase in Tuscany will not be easy to satisfy without a significant revision of local farm practices, aimed primarily at reducing the use of nitrogen <b>fertilisers</b> and diesel <b>consumption.</b> In fact, the GHG emissions reported in the RED for sunflower cultivation were calculated using excessively low farm inputs compared with the typical amounts for sunflower cultivation practices in Tuscan...|$|R

The applications of LCA (life cycle assessment) methodology to greenhouse crops, point out the difficult to analyse an agricultural production with large use of energy, raw materials, structures and equipments, but also depending by the biology of vegetables, cultivation systems and the economic growers chooses. The evaluation of baby plants, in term of energy and materials consumptions, is the first step to realize an LCA analysis of whole productive cycle. At this aim, an LCI (life cycle inventory) was been realised near nursery farm in order to gathering production data of grafted baby plant of rose. The same search was carried out into a nursery farm that produces sowbread baby plants by F 1 seedling. These two ornamental plants have been selected because representing the commercial typologies of cut flower and pot plant most growed in Terlizzi’s area, an ornamental greenhouse district in Apulia - Southern Italy. The informations about the production of baby plant have been collected in a database and processed by specific LCA software. Further investigations have been done in order to analyze and evaluate the fertilisers and pesticides used in the nursery. The results of LCA analysis have been expressed by means of the environmental burdens produced by energy, water, packaging, <b>fertilisers</b> and pesticides <b>consumptions,</b> structures and equipments, used in the production of baby plant. The results of this research point out that the environmental burdens of the production of baby plants are negligible in the rose production and considerable in the pot sowbread production principally because of the contributions of polystyrene plateaux and Polyvinylchloride plastic pot...|$|R

In Sicily, where this survey has been conducted, the principle of ‘biogas done right’ has considerable potential to be applied efficiently. In particular, in Sicily, anaerobic digestion can make use of at least three macro-categories of biomass: (1) waste and agricultural and agro-industrial by-products (e.g. olive residues, citrus pulp, whey) which are often treated as wastes; (2) silage from traditional Mediterranean crops in rotation or the second harvest of the main crops chosen according to irrigation availability; (3) silage or plant cuttings from typically Mediterranean bushy crops (e.g. Prickly pear, Opuntia spp) grown on marginal land (Selvaggi et al. 2018 a; Valenti et al. 2017 c).|$|E

This article proposes the use of data envelopment analysis and stochastic frontier analysis techniques to analyse variation in MB-based EE.

40|$|The current govenrmnet of Ethiopia has put {{agricultural}} at {{the heart}} of its policies. there is particular emphasis on prompting adoption of fertlisier, improved seeds and the efficiency of inputs marketing and distribution. In this paper we use a nationaly representative data set for 1994 to analyse what factors influence adoption of as well as intensity of fertiliser use of small-scale farmers. results show that farmer literacy, access to all-weather roads, acces to banking, extension services, and the labour availability play a role in fertiliser adoption. Addressing the first four points would substantially increase the rate of adoption. With regard to the amount of fertliser used we find that smaller sized farms use this input more intensively. Further we find that previous experience with fertiliser, supply, liquidity, oxen owned owned by the household, and the ratio of the price of the main crop to the cost of fertiliser are important. Availability of credit ad supply constraints ar important factors in constraining fertliser use. Our results suggest that the effect of the subsidy on <b>fertiliser</b> <b>consumption</b> is small and that providing credit would be much more effective in terms of raising adoption of level of use of fertliser and thus contributing to increasing agricultural output. ...|$|E
40|$|Fertiliser use in {{agriculture}} increased rapidly during the green revolution and global fertiliser use increased by about 310 % from the mid- 1960 s {{to the end}} of the 1980 s. Nutrient management in Vietnam was not part of this development until after the start of the reform policy ‘doi moi’, which entailed the introduction of new crops and new <b>fertilisers,</b> increased the <b>consumption</b> of mineral <b>fertilisers,</b> and led to higher yields, but also possibly to higher losses of nutrients to the environment. This development is most pronounced in the peri-urban areas and the densely populated river deltas (the Red River delta and the Mekong River delta). The objective of this thesis was to investigate the existing nutrient management in a peri-urban village northwest of Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam and to elucidate the farmers’ underlying rationale. Nutrient management was assessed by nutrient balances and flows on 9 representative farms containing one or more of the following production units: pigs, crops, and fish. The data were gathered through interviews and chemical analysis of inputs and outputs. Participatory methods were used to gather information on the farmers’ concepts about soil fertility and fertilisers and their access to information. The results from the nutrient balances showed that the farming systems investigated were high nutrient input systems and that there was generally poor nutrient use efficiency both at farm and field level. On the livestock farms nutrient input ranged from 209 to 2113 kg N, 76 - 771 kg P and 84 - 1167 kg K ha- 1 year - 1. On the stockless farms the figures were generally somewhat lower, i. e. 38 - 928 kg N, 25 - 656 kg P, and 32 - 486 kg K ha- 1 year - 1. Except in one rice field, the nitrogen balances at field level were positive in all cases, with surpluses of between 31 to 1736 kg N ha - 1 and year. The P balances were positive in all fields with surpluses of between 20 to 1292 kg P ha- 1 and year, while the K balances were somewhat lower with surpluses of 9 to 913 kg K ha- 1 and year, and negative in one rice field and one orchard. The positive farm balances on livestock farms could to some degree be explained by the high livestock density and poor use of the excreta from livestock production. The positive balances at field/crop level could be explained by the farmers’ concept of fertilisers which included a wide range of amendments added to promote good conditions for plant growth. The farmers’ concept of fertilisers did not comprise the nutrient flow, which may indicate that the farmers did not know that their nutrient management created nutrient surpluses. Instead they perceived that they fertilised too little, due to low investment capacity resulting from the unstable market. However the economic inputs were only 5 - 10 % of the income from crop harvest, although they were slightly higher for high-income crops (e. g. jasmine and vegetables) and newly established orchards. The positive nutrient balances may pose an environmental hazard and suggested measures to improve nutrient management were to make the nutrient flow transparent to the farmers by providing information on the nutrient content of different fertilisers as well as the nutrient requirement of the crop. For livestock farms it is also important to make better use of liquid excreta and to spread solid manure on larger areas than today...|$|R
40|$|Source-separation {{of human}} urine is one {{promising}} technique for closing the nutrient cycle, reducing nutrient discharge and increasing energy efficiency. Separated urine {{can be used}} as a valuable fertiliser in agriculture, replacing mineral fertiliser. However, a proper handling of the urine at farm level is crucial for the environmental performance of the whole system. This study started from an agricultural point of view, demonstrating how grain production systems using human urine might be designed. The main objective was to evaluate the consequences on environmental impact and resource management when human urine replaced mineral fertiliser in arable farming. Production of winter wheat and spring barley when only mineral fertilisers were used was compared to a scenario where a combination of human urine and mineral fertilisers was used. The method for assessing the two different scenarios was Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and the functional unit was 1 kg of grain. In the systems analysis, a change-orientated perspective was used whereby all major changes in the agricultural system using urine (the urine-separating scenario) were taken into account, compared to the conventional scenario. When urine is separated from the remaining wastewater, the production of drinking water as well as the wastewater handling is affected. These changes were taken into account through subtraction of the burdens avoided when separating urine. Production of capital goods, e. g. storage tanks, was also included in the urine-separating scenario in those cases where differences between the scenarios appeared. The results obtained were quite similar as regards the two grain production systems. Differences appeared instead when comparing the conventional scenario to the urineseparating scenario. For both scenarios, most of the energy required was fossil fuel. The use of fossil fuel was slightly higher in the scenario using human urine as <b>fertiliser,</b> but electricity <b>consumption</b> was higher in the conventional scenario. Whether a urine-separating scenario will decrease the energy usage depends on many factors, and is not self-evident. The construction phase might make a considerable contribution and the sense in which the existing water and wastewater system is affected will also be important. With the assumptions made in this study, the urine can be transported more than 40 km one way without exceeding the total energy used in the conventional scenario. However, minimising transports is just one of several key issues from an energy point of view. The contribution of greenhouse gases, expressed as GWP, from the two scenarios was of the same magnitude, although slightly less from the urine-separating scenario. For both scenarios, nitrous oxide originating from soil emissions gave the highest contribution. The difference in contribution to eutrophication was considerable between the two scenarios, due to the avoided emissions of eutrophying substances in the urine-separating scenario. Which scenario contributed most to acidification depended on in what sense nitrogen compounds contribute to acidification. A considerable part of the phosphorus required as mineral fertiliser can be replaced by phosphorus in human urine. When half of the nitrogen required in winter wheat was applied as human urine, approximately 40 % of the phosphorus required came from the urine. Guaranteed quality is of major importance when discussing the use of human urine on arable land. The composition as regards heavy metals, organic pollutants, pathogens and plant nutrients must therefore be guaranteed. The level of heavy metals in human urine is very low. The contribution of e. g. cadmium is even lower than in some "cadmium-free fertilisers". The hygienic risks can be almost eliminated with adequate storage. However, the risks related to pharmaceuticals in urine must be further investigated...|$|R

It has been demonstrated that controlling NH 3 emissions through application of technical measures might {{have an impact on}} {{emissions of}} N 2 O and CH 4. This paper presents estimates of NH 3, N 2 O and CH 4 emissions from European agriculture for 1990 and four scenarios for the year 2010. The first scenario assumes no specific NH 3 abatement, but emissions of all three gases decline between 1990 and 2010 as a result of projected reductions in animal numbers and <b>fertiliser</b> <b>consumption</b> in Europe. The other three scenarios assume different levels of NH 3 abatement in Europe, including the maximum feasible reduction case. They are compared with respect to their effect on emissions of N 2 O and CH 4. The results indicate that in Europe, abating agricultural emissions of NH 3 may cause releases of N 2 O from this sector up to 15 % higher than in the case of no NH 3 control. There may be substantial differences in the observed effects between various countries depending on the degree and type of NH 3 control options applied. The effect of NH 3 abatement on CH 4 emissions was found to be negligible...|$|E
40|$|Global {{biodiversity}} loss {{is driven}} principally by {{the expansion of}} agriculture. This expansion has slowed over the last 50 years as agricultural production has intensified, largely {{through the use of}} petrochemical-based fertilisers. The mid- 2000 s saw a transition where oil production became unresponsive to the increased demand for petrochemicals, pushing up their price and that of their end-products, including fertilisers. Such oil supply constraints threaten to reverse previous agricultural intensification gains and increase pressure for the conversion of native ecosystems. Price-driven land and food speculation and the search for alternative energy sources also have the potential to increase the demand for land. This study aimed to measure the change in the rate of deforestation and to map the resultant impact on biodiversity as oil production became inelastic in 2005. Globally, an additional 290, 000 km of forests was cleared in the period 2007 - 12 compared with 2000 - 2006, which is a net increase of 29 % between the two periods. The areas of increased forest loss broadly corresponded with the areas of highest biodiversity. We tested for, but found little correspondence with large-scale, corporate land acquisitions. Statistically significant hotspots of increased threat to biodiversity generally lie in a band through the tropics, particularly in south-east Asia, Africa and Central America, with <b>fertiliser</b> <b>consumption</b> affected in hotspot areas. A review of the drivers in these hotspots indicated that non-subsistence growth factors underpin most land-cover change. We conclude that conservation efforts need to mitigate pressures from growth and agricultural extensification, and be aware that the rate of loss increased with oil supply constraint in tropical and sub-tropical regions, coinciding with the areas of highest biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{fertilisers}} are {{key element}} of modern technology and have {{played an important role}} in agricultural productivity growth in India. However, the demand-supply gap of fertilisers in India has increased in recent times, thereby leading to increased dependency on imports. Indian imports, which were about 2 million tonnes in early part of 2000, increased to 10. 2 million tonnes of fertilisers in 2008 - 09. In view of importance of fertilisers in agricultural growth and the possibility of an emerging demand-supply gap, there is need to forecast future demand. The paper begins with an overview of <b>fertiliser</b> <b>consumption</b> trends and then identifies important determinants of fertiliser demand and develops projects demand scenarios for fertilisers in India in 2020 - 21. India is the second largest consumer of fertilisers in the world after China, consuming about 26. 5 million tonnes. However, average intensity of fertiliser use in India remains much lower than most countries in the world but is highly skewed, with wide inter-regional, inter-state, and inter-district variations. The results show that non-price factors such as irrigation, high yielding varieties, were more important than price factors in influencing demand for fertilisers. Of the two price policy instruments, affordable fertiliser prices and higher agricultural commodity prices, the former is more powerful in influencing fertiliser demand. The paper suggests that in order to ensure self-sufficiency in agricultural production in the country, availability of fertilisers at affordable prices should be prioritized over higher output prices. By 2020, fertiliser demand in the country is projected to increase to about 41. 6 million tones and is expected to grow at a faster rate in eastern and southern region compared with north and west. To meet the increasing fertiliser requirements of the country, a conducive and stable policy environment, availability of raw materials, capital resources, and price incentives will play a critical role. ...|$|E

Beside other basic soil properties soil phosphorus (P) content of the samples were also measured in a single laboratory in both years. Based on the results of the LUCAS Topsoil survey we performed an assessment of plant available P status of European croplands. Higher P levels can be observed in regions where higher crop yields can be expected and where high fertiliser P inputs are reported. Plant available phosphorus levels were determined using two selected fertilizer recommendation systems; one from Hungary and one from the United Kingdom. The fertiliser recommendation system of the UK does not recommend additional fertiliser use on croplands with highest P supply, which covers regions mostly in Belgium and the Netherlands. According to a Hungarian advisory system {{there is a need for}} fertilizer P input in all regions of the EU. We established a P fertiliser need map based on integrating results from the two systems. Based on data from 2009 and 2012, P input demand of croplands in the European Union was estimated to 3, 849, 873 tons(P 2 O 5) /year. In the meanwhile we found disparities of calculated input need and reported fertiliser statistics both on local (country) scale and on EU level. The first ever uniform topsoil P survey of the EU highlights the contradictions between soil P management of different countries of the Union while also highlights the inconsistencies between reported P <b>fertiliser</b> <b>consumption</b> and advised P doses. Our analysis shows a status of a baseline period of the years 2009 and 2012, while a repeated LUCAS topsoil survey can be a useful tool to monitor future changes of nutrient levels, including P in soils of the EU.

The global economic impact of BNF technology is enormous, estimated at $ 85 billion annually. But donor and government policy makers {{do not have access}} to meaningful and accurate data with which to make effective decisions on national investments in BNF technology. It is infrequent that a BNF development component of a research project is viewed under the microscope and analysed for economic impact eight years after start-up. In May 1993, a team made up of USAID, NifTAL and Zambian BNF specialists pursued a unique opportunity to accurately measure the various impacts resulting from the introduction of BNF technology. Prior to NifTAL’s participation in the establishment of the inoculant production unit at Mt. Makulu in 1984, there was minimal inoculant production and the soyabean industry was just emerging. This situation provided a clear database. Other complimentary factors include the single crop — single inoculant — single user situation that exists in Zambia which facilitated data collection and narrowed the focus enabling the team to produce meaningful and accurate conclusions. High quality inoculant production was effectively maintained at Mt. Makulu up to the 1989 - 90 production season; in 1990, peat processing and inoculant production was transferred to the Balmoral Veterinary Research Institute. Although soyabean is not the predominant legume crop, its production level is increasing at a fast rate with a production growth rate of 27 % and an increase in area under production from 5 300 ha in 1982 to 35 000 ha in 1990 (an increase of 660 %).

30|$|In {{agricultural}} systems {{the natural}} biogeochemical cycles can be supplemented {{by the addition}} of readily available, inorganic fertilisers. Agricultural productivity in Ireland has historically been limited by P, but the application of fertiliser P, which peaked in the 1970 s, has resulted in an increase in levels of available soil P such that about 50 % of Irish grassland soils no longer respond to added P (Culleton et al. 2002). Overall <b>fertiliser</b> <b>consumption</b> in Ireland is now falling, from 430, 000, 62, 000 and 151, 000 tonnes N, P, K respectively (N:P 6.9) in 1994 to the latest available figures of 307, 000, 20, 000 and 52, 000 tonnes (N:P 15.2) in 2008 (DAFF 2008). In 2002 Irish grasslands received an average of 123, 11 and 27 kg N, P, K ha− 1 year− 1 (N:P 11.2) (Coulter et al. 2004). Even so, the majority of P in typical grassland soil is present as organic P which represents a large pool of potentially available nutrient (Bourke et al. 2008). Although the agronomic objective of the added nutrients is to increase plant production, they will also be available to the soil microbial biomass. The soil microorganisms will see an indirect increase in soil C, from increased rhizodeposition and increased residue incorporation from the extra plant growth, and a direct increase in N and P from the added nutrients. Microorganisms can compete effectively with plants for these nutrients (Schimel et al. 1989; Zak et al. 1990). Applied inorganic N, for example, is rapidly taken up by the soil microbial biomass (Nannipieri et al. 1990) which can be limited by nutrients and not just C (Kaye and Hart 1997; Wang and Bakken 1997), although the outcome of the plant–microorganism competition depends on the spatial heterogeneity of the system (Korsaeth et al. 2001). Previous work on cut, rather than grazed, grassland showed clearly that both microbial biomass P and the biomass C:P ratio were sensitive to long-term (> 100 years) fertiliser regimes (He et al. 1997). Growth experiments using environmental isolates of bacteria recently demonstrated that their stoichiometry is very flexible, with a four-fold change in C:P ratio between P-sufficient and P-deficient conditions (Scott et al. 2012). This could result in a less homeostatic variation in C:N:P ratios within a site than suggested by the meta-analysis of (Cleveland and Liptzin 2007).|$|E
40|$|Low mineral {{fertiliser}} use received much attention in Africa {{over the last}} decades. As fertiliser sales have exponentially grown in Ethiopia, and evidence exists of a supply that is beyond the demand in the drier northern parts of the country, we investigated the geographical determinants of inorganic fertiliser sales and its resale prices in north Ethiopia. Quantitative data on fertiliser provision and prices {{on the black market}} in 2016 were obtained from official statistics and from key informants in each of the 35 studied districts and in all municipalities of the Raya area. Environmental variables were collected from spatial databases. To promote inorganic fertiliser, agricultural experts use incentives, and also barter the purchase of fertiliser by a farmer against food aid or other advantages from the authorities. The high application rate that is aimed at (200 kg ha(- 1)) contrasts with the dominance of less-responsive soils in the study area, for which inorganic fertiliser application does not result in higher crop yields, or even leads to root burn. The quantitative analysis shows that 40. 7 10 (3) Mg of fertiliser were officially sold in the study area in 2016, which corresponds to 52 kg ha(- 1). This is notably different from the application rate, as reselling widely occurs, at 50 % of the official price for diammonium phosphate (DAP) and 54 % for urea, mostly to users outside the community. By accepting the opportunity offered by agricultural companies and traders, smallholders save themselves from greatei losses. The black market rate is strongly and positively correlated to monthly rainfall at sowing time (July 2016) (R- 2 = 0. 44; n = 31; p < 0. 01). In the four districts with spate irrigation, black market prices for inorganic fertiliser are low (35 % of the official rate) and small quantities are sold officially (32 kg ha(- 1)). This corresponds to the farmers' saying that there "nobody needs inorganic fertiliser since the spate irrigation adds organic and inorganic nutrients yearly". We found similarities to the 'Green Revolution' in Mexico: the forced delivery of high-cost fertiliser, and the reselling at half price in the black market. Inorganic fertilisers are one of the elements that have allowed boosting agricultural production in Ethiopia; our findings indicate however that in the study area, the fertiliser policy needs to be much fine-tuned so that it is led by agronomic needs, rather than by statistics of inorganic <b>fertiliser</b> <b>consumption,</b> that hide complex environmental variability and socio-political relations...|$|E
