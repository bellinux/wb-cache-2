In order to assess the capability of protective equipment in reducing eye and facial injuries, this innovative advanced headform has been developed to predict injury.

40|$|The contact area, {{as well as}} {{the contact}} pressure, is created when a {{respiratory}} protection device (a respirator or surgical mask) contacts a human face. A computer-based algorithm for determining the contact area between <b>a</b> <b>headform</b> and N 95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) was proposed. Six N 95 FFRs were applied to five sizes of standard headforms (large, medium, small, long/narrow, and short/wide) to simulate respirator donning. After the contact simulation between <b>a</b> <b>headform</b> and <b>an</b> N 95 FFR was conducted, a contact area was determined by extracting the intersection surfaces of the headform and the N 95 FFR. Using computer-aided design tools, a superimposed contact area and an average contact area, which are non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) surfaces, were developed for each headform. Experiments that directly measured dimensions of the contact areas between headform prototypes and N 95 FFRs were used to validate the simulation results. Headform sizes influenced all contact area dimensions (P < 0. 0001), and N 95 FFR sizing systems influenced all contact area dimensions (P < 0. 05) except the left and right chin regions. The medium headform produced the largest contact area, while the large and small headforms produced the smallest. 254 - 2009 -M- 31878 /PHS HHS/United States 254 - 2010 -M- 36735 /PHS HHS/United States 254 - 2012 -M- 52258 /PHS HHS/United StatesCC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 02 - 09 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 24579752 PMC 474703...|$|R

40|$|Instabilities can {{introduce}} highly non-linear effects into structural problems. The instabilities, not clearly {{associated with a}} change in a parameter, result in a stochastic variation of the responses. This process variation can be distinguished {{from the effects of}} the parameter variation by mapping the response variation onto a predictable space and a residual space, where the predictable space contains the possible effects of the parameter variation, and the residual space contains the process effects. This study discusses the sources (mechanics) of the response variation in this class of problems, the use of response surfaces to distinguish between effects driven by design variable changes and bifurcations, and the visualization of unstable zones in the structure.

40|$|Evaluating {{performance}} of occupant retention countermeasures {{at the side}} windows through full-scale crash tests are typically expensive and yield inconclusive results. The results are inconclusive due to the non-repeatable nature of this testing. Another approach utilizes guided impact testing that propels <b>an</b> attached <b>headform</b> into <b>a</b> window to evaluate performances of these safety systems. This may provide some procedural value in generating repeatable results with limited objectives. The capability to limit the guided impact headform displacement relative to a vehicle's exterior window plane is assumed to represent reduced risk of occupant ejection. However, {{it is not known}} what ejection risk is represented for <b>a</b> given <b>headform</b> excursion. This study characterized headform excursions in guided impact testing for a given window airbag design with a range of restraint capabilities. Not surprising, disparities in the headform excursions were observed depending on the impact location of the impact on the airbag. System level evaluation of the airbag design in a rollover environment was conducted to determine which restraint capabilities represented a reduced risk of occupant ejection. A correlated computer model of NHTSA’s Dynamic Rollover Fixture (DRF) was used to identify the restraint characteristics for the airbags in which occupant ejection occurred as well as those where occupant retention was achieved in order to establish <b>a</b> relationship to <b>headform</b> excursion. However, the relationship for <b>a</b> given <b>headform</b> excursion to ejection risk was not apparent due to disparity in the headform excursion results. Review of simulations in the DRF showed that as the occupant interacted with the airbag, occupant moved from the region of the airbag where excursions were the lowest, towards the region of the airbag where headform excursion was greatest. The dummy moved forward until it “pocketed ” in the un-inflated front zone of the airbag or until it escaped out of the zone with the highest allowable excursion...|$|R

40|$|A three {{dimensional}} Finite Element Model of {{an existing}} full-face motorcycle helmet mounted on <b>a</b> <b>headform</b> has been developed. Material parameters were obtained from literature data and from component tests. The model is validated by simulating impacts at different locations using the headforrn acceleration time histories. From this {{it can be concluded}} that the headform response is predicted in a realistic way. The simulations showed two phenomena that influence the headform response, i. e. the behaviour of the material between the headform and the point of impact, and the dynamic response of the outer regions of the outer shell. It is believed that the current model describes most of the phenomena observed during an impact and, therefore, is suitable for future optimization studies. The application of the current model is limited to impacts on a flat anvil at points in the median plane of the headform. Recommendations for further model enhancements will be presented...|$|R

It focuses on the investigation of suitable materials for the headband by examining their impact absorbing properties. Tests consisted of: a series of impacts where material was interposed between a steel slab and the <b>headform</b> dropped from <b>a</b> height; a series a of drop tests where prototype headbands were attached to <b>a</b> <b>headform</b> and dropped against standard helmet testing anvils; and a series of tests with the most promising prototypes in which the headband was attached to the headform and then fired against an internal structure of a passenger car. Two prototype concepts appear worthy of further investigation: a headband constructed of polyurethane foam and a headband consisting of a cardboard honeycomb liner encased in a hard shell both significantly reduced the severity of impacts with the car structures. However, further investigation into optimising the selection of materials for their impact absorbing qualities and their comfort and durability in normal use is warranted.

40|$|In a {{respirator}} fit test, a subject {{is required to}} perform a series of exercises that include moving the head {{up and down and}} rotating the head left and right.

40|$|A {{topic of}} great {{consideration}} in current vehicle development in Europe is pedestrian protection. The enforcement {{of a new}} regulation trying to decrease the injuries to head, pelvis, and leg of pedestrian impacted by cars, is imposing great changes in vehicles' front design. In the present work a design solution for the bonnet, which is the main body part interacting with the human head during a car to pedestrian collision, is proposed. This solution meets the stiffness and safety targets, {{takes into account the}} manufacturing and recyclability requirements and gives a relevant contribution to vehicle lightweight. Thus this proposed solution puts in evidence that safety and lightweight are not incompatible targets. The amount of potential injury to the pedestrian head is evaluated, as prescribed by the standard test procedures, by means of <b>a</b> <b>headform</b> launched on the bonnet. However, the standard approach based on the head injury criterion (HIC) value only is reported to be largely unsatisfactory: therefore, a new experimental methodology for the measurement of the translational and the rotational accelerations has been developed, and the experimental results are reported.

40|$|Head impacts {{tests are}} {{conducted}} {{as part of}} many types of safety testing, with applications including vehicle crashes, helmets and sports surfaces. A common measure of head injury in these tests is the Head Injury Criterion (HIC), which is calculated from the measured acceleration of <b>a</b> <b>headform</b> during the impact. In this paper, these headform impacts are represented by a Hertz contact model to which a damping term has been added. A power law relationship {{was found to be}} appropriate for modelling the effect of headform mass and impact speed on HIC and peak displacement. It was found that the stiffness and damping in the model did not affect the exponents in the power law, but the exponent of displacement in the contact model did have an effect on all of the exponents in the power law. This result may explain why some variation exists in real data. The relationships presented in this paper may be used to predict how the HIC and maximum displacement of the head will vary for a given change in head mass or impact speed. This has applications in test protocol development and for evaluating the safety performance of tested structures under a variety of real world conditions. Daniel J. Searson, Robert W. G.

40|$|The most {{frequent}} {{type of injury}} that causes death or disability in motorcycle accidents is head injury. The only item of personal protective equipment that protects a motorcyclist's head in real-world accidents is the safety helmet. The protective capability of a helmet is assessed, according to international standards, through the impact of <b>a</b> <b>headform</b> fitted with the helmet onto an anvil. The {{purpose of the present}} work was to study the influence of the presence of the body on the impact response of the helmeted head. Full-body and detached-head impacts were simulated using the finite element (FE) method. As a consequence of the presence of the body, the crushing distance of the helmet liner was drastically increased. This evidence indicated that the effect of the body should be included in impact absorption tests in order to provide conditions that are more realistic and stringent. The solution to an analytical model of the helmeted headform impact revealed that increasing the headform mass has the same influence on impact outputs, particularly the liner's crushing distance, as including the whole body in impact tests. The added mass was calculated by using a helmeted Hybrid III dummy for an impact configuration that frequently occurred in real-world accidents...|$|R

40|$|Current {{regulations}} for assessing pedestrian safety use a simplified test setup that ignores many real-world factors. In particular, {{the level of}} protection is assessed using <b>a</b> free-motion <b>headform</b> impacting the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s hood at a fixed angle. As such, this test setup does not capture the effect due to the vehicle front-end profile, nor does it comprehend injury due to a possible secondary impact of the pedestrian 2 ̆ 7 s head with ground. This thesis aims to numerically simulate vehicle to pedestrian crashes to develop knowledge that may suggest ways to improve safety {{above and beyond the}} regulatory tests. Inputs to the simulations include the vehicle front-end profile, impact speed, and pedestrian size. Outputs include the angle of primary head impact to the hood, the extent of head injury (HIC), and {{whether or not there is}} a secondary head impact with the ground. One key finding is that head impact angles, and hence head injury measures, vary greatly due to changes in vehicle front-end profile. This suggests that the current test setup for assessing pedestrian head impact, which assumes a fixed head-impact angle, could be improved to better capture the kinematics of real-world pedestrian crash events. One improvement could be the use of a full scale pedestrian dummy or human body model rather than <b>a</b> free motion <b>headform.</b> <b>A</b> second finding is that severity of head injury is much greater in a secondary head impact with ground than in the primary impact with the hood. Moreover, it is possible to avoid the secondary head impact with ground by careful designing of vehicle front-end profile.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the correlation of}} N 95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) fit between <b>a</b> Static Advanced <b>Headform</b> (StAH) and 10 human test subjects. Quantitative fit evaluations were performed on test subjects who made three visits to the laboratory. On each visit, one fit evaluation was performed on eight different FFRs of various model/size variations. Additionally, subject breathing patterns were recorded. Each fit evaluation comprised three two-minute exercises: "Normal Breathing," "Deep Breathing," and again "Normal Breathing. " The overall test fit factors (FF) for human tests were recorded. The same respirator samples were later mounted on the StAH and the overall test manikin fit factors (MFF) were assessed utilizing the recorded human breathing patterns. Linear regression {{was performed on the}} mean log 10 -transformed FF and MFF values to assess the relationship between the values obtained from humans and the StAH. This is the first study to report a positive correlation of respirator fit between <b>a</b> <b>headform</b> and test subjects. The linear regression by respirator resulted in R(2) = 0. 95, indicating a strong linear correlation between FF and MFF. For all respirators the geometric mean (GM) FF values were consistently higher than those of the GM MFF. For 50 % of respirators, GM FF and GM MFF values were significantly different between humans and the StAH. For data grouped by subject/respirator combinations, the linear regression resulted in R(2) = 0. 49. A weaker correlation (R(2) = 0. 11) was found using only data paired by subject/respirator combination where both the test subject and StAH had passed a real-time leak check before performing the fit evaluation. For six respirators, the difference in passing rates between the StAH and humans was < 20 %, while two respirators showed a difference of 29 % and 43 %. For data by test subject, GM FF and GM MFF values were significantly different for 40 % of the subjects. Overall, the advanced headform system has potential for assessing fit for some N 95 FFR model/sizes. VZB 3 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 06 - 17 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 25265037 PMC 447038...|$|R
