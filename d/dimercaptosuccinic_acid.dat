5|$|Research on the {{treatment}} of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and <b>dimercaptosuccinic</b> <b>acid</b> (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP. Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of {{a small fraction of}} the total estimated body mercury.

25|$|Prevention is {{by using}} water {{that does not}} contain high levels of arsenic. This may be {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} special filters or using rainwater. There is not good evidence to support specific treatments for long-term poisoning.

500|$|On June 11, 2007, {{the plaintiffs}} {{presented}} their first argument, {{in which they}} contended that Michelle Cedillo, {{as well as other}} children with autism, suffered from a [...] "mercury efflux disorder" [...] which was described by Aposhian, their first expert witness, as [...] "a problem with getting a metal, in this case mercury, out of a cell." [...] As evidence that such disorders have been documented before, he pointed to Wilson's disease. Aposhian based this claim, in part, on three peer-reviewed papers. The first such study was co-authored by Boyd Haley, and concluded that hair of children with autism contained less mercury than that of children without autism. Aposhian stated that [...] "we know that the hair is an excretory organ and that the hair is reflective of the mercury or the metal in the blood, and the blood {{is a reflection of the}} mercury in the tissues, and so the fact that the children with autism had less mercury in their hair was a hint or indication that perhaps there was mercury efflux disorder." [...] The second of these studies was conducted by James B. Adams, and found that baby teeth of children with autism had more than twice as much mercury as those of children without autism. Aposhian cited this study as evidence that [...] "autistic children have a greater body burden of mercury." [...] Another study which Aposhian used to back up this statement was one conducted by Jeff Bradstreet and Mark Geier, which gave <b>dimercaptosuccinic</b> <b>acid,</b> a chelating agent, to children and concluded that children with autism excreted much more mercury thereafter than children without autism.

50|$|<b>Dimercaptosuccinic</b> <b>acid</b> (DMSA), {{also called}} succimer, is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} lead, mercury, and arsenic poisoning.

50|$|<b>Dimercaptosuccinic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of lead poisoning in children with blood level measured above 45 µg/dL. The use of DMSA is not approved for prevention of lead poisoning in anticipation of exposure in known lead contaminated environments. Its elimination half-life is 2.5-3.5 hours. DMSA can cross the blood-brain barrier of mice, but not that of humans, limiting its use to extracting heavy metals from parts of the body other than the central nervous system.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{treatment}} camps {{were established}} by health authorities {{to deal with}} the crisis. The World Health Organization, Médecins Sans Frontières and Blacksmith Institute assisted with the epidemic. Federal health ministry epidemiologist Henry Akpan said: [...] "We are working with the state ministry of health to give health education and create enlightenment on the dangers of illegal mining". [...] Nigeria's chief epidemiologist Dr. Henry Akpan announced the discovery of the epidemic on 4 June 2010. Blacksmith has been removing toxic lead from houses and compounds in the villages so that surviving children returning from treatment will not be re-exposed to toxic lead in their homes. The <b>dimercaptosuccinic</b> <b>acid</b> (DMSA) chelation therapy deployed to 3,180 children by MSF is associated with a substantial reduction in the mortality rate of observed and potential lead poisoning cases.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of common {{chelating}} agents with differing affinities for different metals, physical characteristics, and biological mechanism of action. For the most common forms of heavy metal intoxication [...] - [...] lead, arsenic, or mercury [...] - [...] a number of chelating agents are available. <b>Dimercaptosuccinic</b> <b>acid</b> (DMSA) has been recommended for the treatment of lead poisoning in children by poison control centers around the world. Other chelating agents, such as 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS) and alpha lipoic acid (ALA), are used in conventional and alternative medicine. Some common chelating agents are ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide (TTFD). Calcium-disodium EDTA and DMSA are only approved for the removal of lead by the Food and Drug Administration while DMPS and TTFD are not approved by the FDA. These drugs bind to heavy metals in the body and prevent them from binding to other agents. They are then excreted from the body. The chelating process also removes vital nutrients such as vitamins C and E, therefore these must be supplemented.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the predictive value of clinical, labo-ratory, and imaging variables for the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux in children with their first febrile urinary tract infection. Materials and Methods: One hundred fifty-three children with their first febrile uri-nary tract infection were divided into two groups according to the results of voiding cys-tourethrography: 60 children with vesicoureteral reflux and 93 children without.
