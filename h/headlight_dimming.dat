5000|$|A related feature {{offered on}} many General Motors models during the 1950s and 1960s was the Autronic Eye <b>headlight</b> <b>dimming</b> system (which did just that). Cadillac later {{referred}} to its automatic dimming system as [...] "Guidematic Headlamp Control" [...] which encompassed Twilight Sentinel and Dimming Sentinel controls. (See Discussion Page) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Series 62 {{included}} a lower sleeker body, a new cellular grille insert, and inverted gull wing front bumpers and tapered dagmar style bumper guards. Round jet style dual exhaust outlets {{were incorporated into}} the vertical bumper extensions and the rear bumper was entirely redesigned. An Eldorado style wraparound windshield was seen on all models. Sedans used a distinctive style of window reveal molding, which created a built in sun visor effect. For coupes a smoothly curved wraparound backlight {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Florentine" [...] style rear window. A wide ventilator intake was now stretched across the base of the windshield on all body styles and the chrome visored headlamp look was emphasized. The Series 62 could be distinguished by the lack of rear fender louvers. V-shaped ornaments and crests were used in the hood and deck and there were full length body underscores in bright metal. Coupe de Ville script was seen on rear corner pillars of the luxury hardtop, which also had wider sill moldings. The Eldorados had golden identifying crests centered directly behind the air-slot fender breaks and wide fluted beauty panels to decorate the lower rear body sides. These panels were made of extruded aluminum and also appeared on a unique one of a kind Eldorado coupe built for the Reynolds Aluminum Corporation. Also included in the production Eldorado convertible were monogram plates on the doors, wire wheels, and custom interior trimmings with the Cadillac crest embossed on the seat bolsters. Automatic windshield washers, power steering, 12-Volt electrical system, and aluminum alloy pistons made the long list of standard equipment {{for the first time this}} year. Power steering, windows, seats, and auto <b>headlight</b> <b>dimming</b> were optional. [...] A parking brake release reminder light was new. Popular Mechanics rated to 0-60 mph time as 17.3 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The <b>headlight</b> <b>dimmer</b> switch {{was also}} {{removed from the}} floor and {{incorporated}} into the turn signal lever for all 1977 models.|$|R
50|$|The Capri {{was also}} one of the first {{vehicles}} to offer an automatic <b>headlight</b> <b>dimmer</b> as optional equipment. It sold 23,673 copies, amounting to 87% of Lincoln's total output that year, actually down from 29,552 in 1954.|$|R
25|$|As {{it was the}} {{top-line}} Oldsmobile, {{the series}} had the most technologically advanced items available, such as the Hydramatic automatic transmission, the Autronic Eye, an automatic <b>headlight</b> <b>dimmer,</b> and Twilight Sentinel (a feature that automatically turned the headlights on and off via a timer, as controlled by the driver), and the highest-grade interior and exterior trim.|$|R
25|$|In 1953 and 1954, Bel Airs {{could be}} ordered in convertible, hardtop coupe, two- and four-door sedans, and, for 1954, the Beauville station wagon which {{featured}} woodgrain trim {{around the side}} windows. Many new options, once available only to more expensive luxury cars, became offered starting in 1953, including power steering and the Guidematic <b>headlight</b> <b>dimmer</b> in 1953; and power brakes, power 2-way front seat and power front windows in 1954. All 1954 models equipped with the standard transmission used the 1953 Powerglide engine.|$|R
50|$|As {{well as an}} in-car camera view, Shift 2 {{includes}} a helmet-camera in which the players viewpoint is from their driver. The helmet cam moves {{with the head of}} the driver, being drawn from side to side as the car takes corners and jerking forward when the player crashes. As the car comes up to higher speeds, the edges of the screen will become blurred to simulate the tunnel-vision effect that drivers suffer when racing. Shift 2s night racing also appears to be more advanced, with <b>headlights</b> <b>dimming</b> or turning off completely if damaged, further narrowing the players view.|$|R
25|$|Even when {{conditions}} would warrant {{the use of}} high-beam headlamps, drivers often do not use them. There have long been efforts, particularly in America, to devise an effective automatic beam selection system to relieve {{the driver of the}} need to select and activate the correct beam as traffic, weather, and road conditions change. General Motors introduced the first automatic <b>headlight</b> <b>dimmer</b> called the 'Autronic Eye' in 1952 on their Cadillac, Buick, and Oldsmobile models; the feature was offered in other GM vehicles starting in 1953. The system's photoresistor and associated circuitry were housed in a gunsight-like tube atop the dashboard. An amplifier module was located in the engine compartment that controlled the headlight relay using signals from the dashboard-mounted tube unit.|$|R
2500|$|In 1952 the 98 {{remained}} {{as the top}} of the line Oldsmobile. The series shared the higher output 160 HP Rocket V8 with the Super 88s. Standard equipment on the three body styles included bumper guards, gray rubber floor mats front and rear, electric clock, dual horns, aluminum door sill plates, chrome gravel guards, foam rubber seat cushions, turn signals, carpeting front and rear, stainless steel wheel trim rings, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. Upholstery selection was broadcloth or six colors of leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] For the first time power steering was an option.

5000|$|Leather seating {{areas and}} vinyl roof trim were {{available}} on the De Ville, {{but not on the}} Calais (although a high-grade cloth-and-vinyl, similar to what was seen on top-line Buick Electras and Oldsmobile 98s, was). Another item not initially {{available on the}} Calais was the Cadillac-exclusive [...] "firemist" [...] paint, an extra-cost metallic paint. Both the high-end Buick and Oldsmobile models shared the GM C platform with Cadillac. Cadillac, always General Motors' technology leader, offered most De Ville options on the Calais, such as Twilight Sentinel and the GuideMatic <b>headlight</b> <b>dimmer.</b> In 1965, the new Turbo-Hydramatic, standard on the 1964 De Ville, but not the lower-priced Series 62, became standard throughout the Cadillac range - even the Calais. The [...] 429 cid L V8 also remained the standard engine.|$|R
2500|$|The Caprice Estate, a new {{station wagon}} model with {{simulated}} woodgrain exterior trim {{was the first}} Chevrolet with such a design since its real woodie wagon was offered in 1954. All wagons included an all-vinyl upholstered two-row bench seat interior with an optional third rear-facing seat for two. The [...] V8 engine was standard for Caprice models with the [...] "Turbo Jet" [...] V8 optional. It was possible to have Regular Production Option (RPO) L72, a 425-hp big block V8 with solid lifters, special camshaft and carburetor, and 11 to 1 compression.

40|$|Headlights of {{vehicles}} pose a great danger during night driving. The drivers of most vehicles use high, bright beam while driving at night. This causes a discomfort {{to the person}} travelling from the opposite direction. He experiences a sudden glare {{for a short period}} of time. This is caused due to the high intense headlight beam from the other vehicle coming towards him from the opposite direction. We are expected to <b>dim</b> the <b>headlight</b> to avoid this glare. This glare causes a temporary blindness to a person resulting in road accidents during the night. To avoid such incidents, we have fabricated a prototype of automatic <b>headlight</b> <b>dimmer.</b> This automatically switches the high beam into low beam thus reducing the glare effect by sensing the approaching vehicle. It also eliminates the requirement of manual switching by the driver which is not done at all times. The construction, working and the advantages of this prototype model is discussed in detail in this paper...|$|R
25|$|Present systems {{based on}} imaging CMOS cameras can detect and respond {{appropriately}} to leading and oncoming vehicles while disregarding streetlights, road signs, and other spurious signals. Camera-based beam selection was first released in 2005 on the Jeep Grand Cherokee, {{and has since}} then been incorporated into comprehensive driver assistance systems by automakers worldwide. The <b>headlights</b> will <b>dim</b> when a bright reflection bounces off of a street sign.|$|R

50|$|According to Bryant {{his vehicle}} stalled {{when he stopped}} behind Sheppard. His car then lurched forward from his {{attempts}} to restart the vehicle which brought the car close to or in contact with Sheppard’s tire. Expert analysis of security camera footage confirmed the car’s <b>headlights</b> <b>dimmed</b> {{in a manner consistent}} with this explanation and that the vehicle had a “sensitive and light clutch”. The Crown also determined that no damage to the bicycle’s rear wheel rim was evident. Witnesses said that Sheppard confronted Bryant and his wife “loudly and aggressively” while they “remained passive.” The car’s next movement resulted in Sheppard ending up on the hood of the car. The car travelled 30 feet, lasted 2.5 second, the car’s speed was between 9 and 13.4 km/h and brakes were applied after 1 second. According to Bryant he was looking down trying to restart the vehicle and applied the brakes when he saw Sheppard on the hood. The crown determined that there was no evidence Sheppard was seriously injured at this point and there was not enough evidence to justify a separate charge based upon Bryant’s driving to this point.|$|R
50|$|The Grand Am {{included}} Strato bucket seats {{upholstered in}} Naugahyde vinyl or corduroy cloth featuring manual recliners and adjustable lumbar supports - both features common on European-style sports/luxury sedans, but unusual for American cars of that time. Also included were an instrument panel from the Pontiac Grand Prix featuring a Rally gauge cluster with fuel, oil, water and volt gauges (a tachometer or fuel economy gauge was optional, and on cars so equipped, the clock {{was moved to}} a space on the lower instrument panel under the radio), three-spoke padded steering wheel with brushed-stainless spokes, and Genuine Crossfire African Mahogany trim on the dash facing, radio and clock surrounds, {{as well as the}} center console between the front seats. Grand Ams also were among the first U.S.-built cars with a turn-signal mounted <b>headlight</b> <b>dimmer</b> switch that had been common on imported cars for decades. Other standard equipment included concealed windshield wipers, a 1.12 in front stabilizer bar, and an in-the-windshield radio antenna. Upscale options included air conditioning, tinted glass, power windows-locks-seat, rear defogger, various sound systems, and tilt-steering-wheel. AM/FM stereo with a tape player was optional.|$|R

5000|$|The 1959 Cadillac {{is remembered}} for its huge sharp tailfins with dual bullet tail lights, two {{distinctive}} rooflines and roof pillar configurations, new jewel-like grille patterns and matching deck lid beauty panels. In 1959 the Series 62 became the Series 6200. De Villes and 2-door Eldorados were {{moved from the}} Series 62 to their own series, the Series 6300 and Series 6400 respectively, though they all, including the 4-door Eldorado Brougham (which was moved from the Series 70 to Series 6900), shared the same 130 in wheelbase. New mechanical items were a [...] "scientifically engineered" [...] drainage system and new shock absorbers. All Eldorados were characterized by a three-deck, jeweled, rear grille insert, but other trim and equipment features varied. The Seville and Biarritz models had the Eldorado name spelled out behind the front wheel opening and featured broad, full-length body sill highlights that curved over the rear fender profile and back along the upper beltline region. Engine output was an even 345 hp (257 kW) from the 390 cuin L engine. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows, six way power seats, heater, fog lamps, remote control deck lid, radio and antenna with rear speaker, power vent windows, air suspension, electric door locks and license frames. The Eldorado Brougham also came with Air conditioning, automatic <b>headlight</b> <b>dimmer,</b> acruise control standard over the Seville and Biarritz trim lines.|$|R
