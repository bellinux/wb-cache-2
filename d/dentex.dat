2500|$|In 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature {{classified}} 184 {{species as}} vulnerable, 52 as endangered, and 106 as critically endangered. At present, the IUCN only lists Yssichromis sp. nov. [...] "argens" [...] as extinct in the wild, and six species {{are listed as}} entirely extinct, but it is acknowledged that many more possibly belong in these categories (for example, Haplochromis aelocephalus, H. apogonoides, H. <b>dentex,</b> H. dichrourus and numerous {{other members of the}} genus Haplochromis have not been seen since the 1980s, but are maintained as Critically Endangered in the small chance that tiny –but currently unknown– populations survive).|$|E

5000|$|Recently {{the genetic}} {{structure}} of S. <b>dentex</b> and its relations to other co-existing salmonids in the Neretva and Skadar river {{systems have been}} sudied using mitochondrial DNA, microsatellite and 21 other nuclear DNA loci. Genetic analyses showed that the Neretva S. <b>dentex</b> ("zubatak") and the co-existing marble trout (S. marmoratus) formed a genetically unified cluster, while Skadar S. <b>dentex</b> ("strun") was [...] "genetically distinct from S. marmoratus in the same river system and indistinct from local brown trout (S. trutta)". Thus the Neretva and Skadar S. <b>dentex</b> are not closely related but rather [...] "S. <b>dentex</b> is a particular life history form of S. marmoratus in the Neretva basin and of S. trutta in the Skadar basin". [...] "These results clearly demonstrate that S. <b>dentex</b> does not represent a monophyletic lineage {{and should not be}} considered a distinct species." ...|$|E
50|$|Adult <b>dentex</b> {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 1 m, and weight up to 16 kg. Body is oval and compressed. Teeth are very {{developed}} in each jaw. <b>Dentex</b> have 11 dorsal spines: 11-12 dorsal soft rays; 3 anal spines: 7-9 anal soft rays. Adults are grey-blue, while young <b>dentex</b> have a slightly different livery, brown-blue with blue fins.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>dentex</b> {{is found}} in the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean from the British Isles to Mauretania, {{sometimes}} up to Senegal and Canary Islands. It lives in sandy or stony deeps, to 200 m, and is an active predator, feeding on other fish, mollusca and cephalopods. It is usually solitary, although younger <b>dentex</b> form schools and are less elusive. Adult <b>dentex</b> can reach a length of one metre, and weigh up to 14 kg.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dentex</b> is {{an active}} predator, feeding on other fish, mollusca and cephalopods.

50|$|Due {{to small}} size Chromis chromis has minor role in {{commercial}} fishing. As a game fish, {{it is often}} caught during the day on light tackle. Small hooks are baited with bread, pasta, small chunks of fish, mussels, worms, small prawns etc It can be caught in fish traps and nets. Due to small size, it is rarely caught with a speargun. It is also used as a baitfish for larger species which predate on damselfish schools such as conger eel Conger conger and common <b>dentex</b> <b>Dentex</b> <b>dentex.</b>|$|E
