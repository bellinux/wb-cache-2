5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{destruction}} of the Quino checkerspot butterfly were raised by the community group Preserve South Bay. That group sued the developer as well as Caltrans and SANDAG in August 1999, following the latter's approval <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> Early the next year, an environmental impact report suggested that Bonita might face negative effects from the freeway, such as noise and having the roadway divide the community. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) allowed the project that year, even though the Environmental Protection Agency objected to it. A contractor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was soon retained by California Transportation Ventures. Another group, Citizens for 125, obtained 7,000 signatures in support of the road.|$|E

5|$|A {{combination}} of Federal and State funding was obtained <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> In March 1972, the entire {{cost of the}} section between 34th Street and 126th Street, according to the project's Draft Environmental Study, {{was estimated to be}} $381 million. In June 1972, it was announced that the UMTA would grant $25 million for the construction of this section of the line. The MTA had requested $254 million in federal funds for {{the northern part of the}} line. Preliminary estimates of the cost of the southern portion of the line came to $450 million.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Soviet Union, two {{problems}} arose <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> The first was geopolitical in nature: the main spacecraft control center was located at the Yevpatoria facility in the Crimea region. This control center was significant in the Soviet space program, being one of only two in the country equipped with a 70m dish antenna. With the breakup of the Union, the Crimea region, although mostly populated by ethnic Russians, found itself part of the newly independent Ukraine and the center was put under Ukrainian national control, prompting new political hurdles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{construction}} was planned {{to begin in}} 2005, the delays in approval of funding pushed back the start date. To facilitate Silver Line construction, responsibility <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was transferred on November 1, 2008, from the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to the MWAA. Utility relocation work began in 2008, and construction began on March 12, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak's February 2011 {{announcement}} of the Gateway Project includes a proposal to extend the 7 service three blocks east of Eleventh Avenue to New York Penn Station, instead of five miles west to Secaucus.

Congress allocated $15 million for studies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> in November 2011, with {{the likelihood that the}} two projects, Gateway and the subway extension, will be in competition for funding.|$|E

Carney, who spoke at the inaugural event and later {{went on to become}} Chairman of the Board <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> raised concerns about whether the United States government was paying attention to the gravity of problems that were beginning to affect Haiti's stability systemically.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, safety {{regulations}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> were scrutinized and revised. A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions and designs for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E
5|$|Belushi {{had become}} a star in 1978 {{as a result of}} both the Blues Brothers' musical success and his role in National Lampoon's Animal House. At one point, he managed the triple feat of being the star of the week's top-grossing film, top-rated {{television}} show, and singing on the number-one album within a year. When Aykroyd and Belushi decided they could make a Blues Brothers film, the bidding war was intense. Universal Studios narrowly beat Paramount Pictures <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> John Landis, who had directed Belushi in Animal House, was aboard as director.|$|E

Concorde was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) fly-by-wire flight-control system; the avionics system Concorde used was unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ hybrid circuits. The principal designer <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was Pierre Satre, with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy.|$|E

Site excavation, marking the actual start of construction, began the following April under the direction of PCL Construction. A construction permit to build the tower was issued on August 17, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Director of {{photography}} Darius Khondji was initially reluctant about {{working on a}} musical but was inspired by Parker's passion <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> For the film's visual style, Khondji and Parker were influenced by the works of American realist painter George Bellows. Khondji shot Evita using Moviecam cameras, with Cooke anamorphic lenses. He used Eastman EXR 5245 film stock for exteriors in Argentina, 5293 for the Argentinean interiors, and 5248 for any scenes shot during overcast days and combat sequences.|$|E
