It concludes that courts should, as with certain gender differences, consider cultural differences when assessing the reasonableness of the employee’s actions in employer liability suits...|$|R

40|$|Homologous {{recombination}} (HR) {{is used in}} vertebrate {{somatic cells}} for essential, RAD 51 -dependent, repair of DNA double-strand-breaks (DSBs), but inappropriate HR can cause genome instability. A transcriptional transactivation-independent role for p 53 in suppressing HR has been established, but is not detected in all HR assays. To address the basis of such exceptions, {{and the possibility that}} suppression by p 53 may be <b>discriminatory,</b> we have <b>conducted</b> a controlled comparison of the effects of p 53 depletion on three different kinds of HR. We show that, within the same cells, p 53 depletion promotes both intra-chromosomal HR (ICHR) and extra-chromosomal HR (ECHR), but not homologous DNA integration (gene targeting; GT). This conclusion holds true for both spontaneous and DSB-induced ICHR and GT. We show further that non-conservative ICHR is more susceptible than conservative ICHR to inhibition by p 53. These results provide strong evidence that p 53 can discriminate between different forms of HR and, despite the fact that GT is used experimentally for gene disruption, is consistent with the possibility that p 53 preferentially suppresses genome-destabilizing forms of HR. While the mechanism of suppression by p 53 remains unclear, our data suggest that it is independent of mismatch repair and of changes in RAD 51 protein levels...|$|R

We evaluated the discriminatory power and the typeability of the most currently used DNA fingerprinting methods for the typing of H. pylori isolates: ribotyping, PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis, and random amplified polymorphism DNA (RAPD) analysis. Forty epidemiologically unrelated clinical isolates were selected to constitute a test population adapted to the evaluation of these performance criteria. A meta-analysis of typeability and <b>discriminatory</b> power was <b>conducted</b> retrospectively with raw data from published studies in which ribotyping, PCR-RFLP, RAPD, repetitive extragenic palindromic DNA sequence-based PCR (REP-PCR), or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used.

40|$|It is {{not always}} {{appreciated}} that proven {{discrimination on the basis}} of race or sex may not amount to a tort and that even persistent racial or sexual harassment may not be enough to qualify for tort recovery. This Article explores the question of whether <b>discriminatory</b> and harassing <b>conduct</b> in the workplace is or should be considered outrageous conduct, actionable under the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. In recent years, courts have taken radically different approaches to the issue, from holding that such claims are preempted to treating the infliction tort as a reinforcement of civil rights principles. The dominant approach views tort claims as mere 2 ̆ 2 gap fillers 2 ̆ 2 that should come into play only in rare cases that do not fit comfortably under other recognized theories of redress. To place the current approaches in perspective and determine the proper location for harassment claims, this Article analyzes the respective domains of torts and civil rights, discussing the prototypical harms and animating philosophies behind the two regimes. It provides a history of the intentional infliction tort-with particular emphasis on how early courts and commentators treated issues of gender, race, and sexuality-and explains a new scholarly turn toward universalism and protection through common law. The Article identifies major innovations in the development of the hostile environment claim to ascertain which basic principles could be transported to tort law. This Article concludes with a critique of the 2 ̆ 2 gap filler 2 ̆ 2 approach and an argument for adapting the limited migration approach of the new Restatement of Torts to allow emerging norms from civil rights to influence the adjudication of tort claims...|$|R
40|$|Systems biology {{relies heavily}} on the {{construction}} of quantitative models of biochemical networks. These models must have predictive power to help unveiling the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular physiology, but it is also paramount that they are consistent with the data resulting from key experiments. Often, it is possible to find several models that describe the data equally well, but provide significantly different quantitative predictions regarding particular variables of the network. In those cases, one is faced with a problem of model discrimination, the procedure of rejecting inappropriate models from a set of candidates in order to elect one as the best model to use for prediction. In this work, a method is proposed to optimize the design of enzyme kinetic assays with the goal of selecting a model among a set of candidates. We focus on models with systems of ordinary differential equations as the underlying mathematical description. The method provides a design where an extension of the Kullback-Leibler distance, computed over the time courses predicted by the models, is maximized. Given the asymmetric nature this measure, a generalized differential evolution algorithm for multi-objective optimization problems was used. The kinetics of yeast glyoxalase I (EC 4. 4. 1. 5) was chosen as a difficult test case to evaluate the method. Although a single-substrate kinetic model is usually considered, a two-substrate mechanism has also been proposed for this enzyme. We designed an experiment capable of discriminating between the two models by optimizing the initial substrate concentrations of glyoxalase I, {{in the presence of the}} subsequent pathway enzyme, glyoxalase II (EC 3. 1. 2. 6). This <b>discriminatory</b> experiment was <b>conducted</b> in the laboratory and the results indicate a two-substrate mechanism for the kinetics of yeast glyoxalase I...|$|R

40|$|It is {{somewhat}} radical {{to suggest that}} an employer should not be held vicariously liable for an employee 2 ̆ 7 s voluntary submission to sexual advances where the alleged harasser is a supervisor, and this approach is a marked departure from existing assumptions regarding sexual harassment. Most decisions and writings on the topic have imposed [...] under a traditional agency theory [...] vicarious liability upon the employer for the sexually harassing conduct of its supervisors. 4 Specifically, courts addressing this issue have held that “[t]here {{is no question that}} a ‘tangible employment action’ occurs when a supervisor abuses his authority to act on his employer 2 ̆ 7 s behalf by threatening to fire a subordinate if she refuses to participate in sexual acts with him, and then actually fires her when she continues to resist his demands. ” This Article goes against the grain of both the cases analyzed and the scholarly articles written to date, though the author nevertheless attempts balance by proposing that a supervisor be jointly and/or severally liable with his employer for the <b>discriminatory</b> or harassing <b>conduct</b> of the supervisor if the supervisor is found to have engaged in sexual harassment. This proposal is fully consistent with the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions defining the scope of tangible employment actions.

40|$|AIM: To {{translate}} into Serbian and {{to investigate the}} validity of the cross-culturally adapted the chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ). METHODS: The questionnaire was validated in 103 consecutive CLD patients treated between October 2009 and October 2010 at the Clinic for Gastroenterology, Clinical Centre of Serbia, Belgrade (Serbia). Exclusion criteria were: age 2) &#x 200 B;&#x 200 B;and liver transplantation. Evaluation of the CLDQ was done based on the following parameters: (1) acceptance is shown by the proportion of missing items; (2) internal reliabilities were assessed for multiple item scales by using Cronbach alpha coefficient; and (3) in order to assess whether the allocation of items in the domain corresponds to their distribution in the original questionnaire (construction validity), an exploratory factor analysis was <b>conducted.</b> <b>Discriminatory</b> validity was determined by comparing the corresponding CLDQ score/sub-score in patients with different severity of the diseases. RESULTS: The Serbian version of CLDQ questionnaire completed 98 % patients. Proportion of missing items was 0. 06 %. The total time needed to fill the questionnaire was ranged from 8 to 15 min. Assistance in completing the questionnaire required 4. 8 % patients, while 2. 9 % needed help in reading, and 1. 9 % involved writing assistance. The mean age of the selected patients was 53. 8 1; 12. 9 years and 54. 4 % were men. Average CLDQ score was 4. 62 1; 1. 11. Cronbach&#x 2019;s alpha for the whole scale was 0. 93. Reliability for all domains was above 0. 70, except for the domain &#x 201 C;Activity&#x 201 D; (0. 49). The exploratory factor analysis model revealed 6 factors with eigenvalue of greater than 1, explaining 69. 7 % of cumulative variance. The majority of the items (66 %) in the Serbian version of the CLDQ presented the highest loading weight in the domain assigned by the CLDQ developers: &#x 201 C;Fatigue&#x 201 D; (5 / 5), &#x 201 C;Emotional function&#x 201 D; (6 / 8), &#x 201 C;Worry&#x 201 D; (5 / 5), &#x 201 C;Abdominal symptoms&#x 201 D; (0 / 3), &#x 201 C;Activity&#x 201 D; (0 / 3), &#x 201 C;Systemic symptoms&#x 201 D; (3 / 5). The scales &#x 201 C;Fatigue&#x 201 D; and &#x 201 C;Worry&#x 201 D; fully corresponded to the original. The factor analysis also revealed that the factors &#x 201 C;Activity&#x 201 D; and &#x 201 C;Abdominal symptoms&#x 201 D; could not be replicated, and two new domains &#x 201 C;Sleep&#x 201 D; and &#x 201 C;Nutrition&#x 201 D; were established. Analysis of the CLDQ score/sub-score distribution according to disease severity demonstrated that patients without cirrhosis had lower total CLDQ score (4. 86 1; 1. 05) than those with cirrhosis Child&#x 2019;s C (4. 31 1; 0. 97). Statistically significant difference was detected for the domains &#x 201 C;Abdominal symptoms&#x 201 D; [F (3) = 5. 818, P = 0. 001] and &#x 201 C;Fatigue&#x 201 D; [F (3) = 3. 39, P = 0. 021]. Post hoc analysis revealed that patients with liver cirrhosis Child&#x 2019;s C had significantly lower sub-score &#x 201 C;Abdominal symptoms&#x 201 D; than patients without cirrhosis or liver cirrhosis Child&#x 2019;s A or B. For domain &#x 201 C;Fatigue&#x 201 D;, patients with cirrhosis Child&#x 2019;s C had significantly lower score, than non-cirrhotic patients.

40|$|Intellectual capital (IC), {{including}} its components of human resource capital (HRC) and relational capital (RC), {{is important to}} leverage tangible corporate assets. This research is conducted from a human resource perspective and refers to behavioural economic theories to explain its findings. There are four research aims which include: (1) to investigate perceptions of 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 mum and dad 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 shareholders about information on HRC and RC dimensions; (2) to understand the sources of advice individual investors turn to in their stock transaction decisions; (3) to determine if, in the corporate annual reports of Australian banking sector corporations (ABSC), HRC and RC information is provided to investors; and (4) to assess {{the relationship between the}} HRC and RC disclosure and share value. Dimensions of HRC include employee recruitment, retention, values, development of management and leadership qualities, and developing employee problem solving skills. Dimensions of RC include customer capital, supplier chain relations, and competitors. The ABSC investigated include the eight ASX 200 listed corporations {{at the end of the}} 2006 / 2007 financial year. These include the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Westpac Banking Corporation (WBC), National Australia Bank (NAB) and ANZ Banking Group Ltd (ANZ). The research involved an initial pilot study and a two-part main study. The pilot study involved both quantitative and qualitative analysis. It was designed to validate a tool to measure perceptions of individual ABSC shareholders, regarding relevance of HRC and RC policy information to ABSC stock purchase decisions. The pilot study was conducted to develop operational definitions of HRC and RC and of their dimensions, and, to establish statistical validity and reliability of items for use in the main study. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to validate policy statement items within the final questionnaire, to properly measure the five dimensions of HRC and three dimensions of RC, for measuring perceptions of ABSC shareholders. Perceptions relate to relevance of HRC and RC policy information to ABSC stock purchase decisions. Questionnaire items were determined to be reliable and valid and retained for use in the main study. The main study is an empirical study investigating perceptions of importance of 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 mum and dad 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 ABSC shareholders of HRC and RC dimensions and the impact of perceptions, sources of advice, and demographic variables on ABSC stock decisions. The ABSC investigated are those identified in the pilot study. Various statistical tests (One-way ANOVA, Bonferroni test, T-test, logistic regression, <b>discriminatory</b> analysis) were <b>conducted</b> on data from the main study questionnaire. The main study also investigates, empirically, the frequency and quality of HRC and RC disclosure by ABSC, and whether disclosure leads to appreciation of share price for the relevant ABSC. A focus group was conducted for thematic content analysis of ABSC corporate annual reports, comparative analysis was conducted on the output of that content analysis, and a cumulative abnormal return (CAR) analysis was conducted, based on content analysis results and on share price information for relevant ABSC in their reporting periods. The research finds 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 mum and dad 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 shareholders of NAB stocks value all HRC and RC dimensions information more than shareholders of the others of the big four ABSC do. They believe customer capital and supplier chain relations dimensions to be more important than shareholders of ANZ stocks believe them to be in ABSC stock purchase decisions.;The research finds 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 mum and dad 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 shareholders of solely NAB stock value HRC and RC information because it is not perceived to be adequately available in the NAB corporate annual report, and shareholders of multiple ABSC, including the NAB, place less value on the information. Employee recruitment is found to be important to 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 mum and dad 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 shareholders in their decisions to 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 buy 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 rather than to 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 hold 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 sell 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 ABSC stocks. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 Family and friends 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 is found to moderate the relationship between perceptions and use of HRC and RC dimensions when deciding whether or not to hold ABSC stocks.
