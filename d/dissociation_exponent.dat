The titration curve was processed using Hyperquad 2006 software. The satisfactory agreement of determined values of dissociation exponents with literature data was found. Key words: <b>dissociation</b> <b>exponent,</b> potentiometric titration, polyaza compound...|$|E
40|$|Bachelor's {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} on dissociation exponents of perfluoroalkanoic acids. The published values of dissociation exponents have been reviewed. The dissociation exponents of six selected perfluoroalkanoic acids (from perfluoropentanoic to perfluorodecanoic acid) were determined using neutralization potentiometric titration method. The values of determined dissociation exponents ranges from pKa = 2, 17 to 2, 44, {{and they are}} in agreement with known data. The decrease of value of <b>dissociation</b> <b>exponent</b> with increasing number of carbon in alkyl chain has been observed. Also, the increase of values of dissociation exponents of perfluoroalkanoic acids in comparison with theirs nonfluorinated analogs has been confirmed...|$|E
