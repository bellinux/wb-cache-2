5|$|Like {{all other}} lemurs, Hadropithecus was endemic to Madagascar. Because it died out only {{recently}} {{and is only}} known from subfossil remains, it {{is considered to be}} a modern form of Malagasy lemur. It once ranged across the Central Plateau, South, and Southwest regions of Madagascar. Within its original range, there were few other lemurs to overlap its ecological niche, and it has been shown to be the only subfossil lemur to consume both C3 and C4 (or CAM) plants, an indication that it lived in more open habitats and had a varied diet. Its physiology and dentition suggest that it may have been much like the <b>Gelada</b> Baboon in locomotion and diet, acting as a manual grazer (picking grass with the hands) since its teeth were well-adapted for grinding either grass or seeds. Microwear patterns on its teeth, as well as its overly large molars, indicate it processed hard objects like nuts or seeds, making it a seed predator. More recent microwear analysis suggests differences between <b>Gelada</b> Baboons and Hadropithecus, indicating that this extinct lemur may not have been a grazer, but strictly a hard object processor.|$|E
5|$|Horses, plains zebras and {{mountain}} zebras live in stable, closed family groups or harems consisting of one adult male, several females and their offspring. These groups {{have their own}} home ranges which overlap {{and they tend to}} be nomadic. The stability of the group remains even when the family stallion dies or is displaced. Plains zebra groups gather into large herds and may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. Among harem-holding species, this behavior has only otherwise been observed in primates like the <b>gelada</b> and the hamadryas baboon. Females of harem species benefit as males give them more time for feeding, protection for their young, as well as protection from predators and harassment by outside males. Among females in a harem, a linear dominance hierarchy exists based on the time at which they join the group. Harems travel in a consistent filing order with the high-ranking mares and their offspring leading the groups followed by the next highest ranking mare and her offspring and so on. The family stallion takes up the rear. Social grooming (which involves individuals rubbing their heads against each other and nipping with the incisors and lips) is important for easing aggression and maintaining social bonds and status. Young of both sexes leave their natal groups as they mature; females are usually abducted by outside males to be included as permanent members of their harems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Geladas</b> are {{primarily}} diurnal. At night, they {{sleep on the}} ledges of cliffs. At sunrise, they leave the cliffs and travel to {{the tops of the}} plateaux to feed and socialize. When morning ends, social activities tend to wane and the <b>geladas</b> primarily focus on foraging. They will travel during this time, as well. When evening arrives, <b>geladas</b> exhibit more social activities before descending to the cliffs to sleep.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Geladas</b> are {{the only}} {{primates}} that are primarily graminivores and grazers [...] grass blades make up to 90% of their diet. They eat both the blades and the seeds of grasses. When both blades and seeds are available, <b>geladas</b> prefer the seeds. They eat flowers, rhizomes and roots when available, using their hands to dig for the latter two. They consume herbs, small plants, fruits, creepers, bushes and thistles. Insects can be eaten, but only rarely and only if they can easily be obtained. During the dry season, grasses are eaten less and herbs are preferred. <b>Geladas</b> consume their food more like ungulates than primates, and they can chew their food as effectively as zebra.|$|R
25|$|The <b>gelada</b> {{has several}} adaptations for its {{terrestrial}} and graminivorous (grass-eating) lifestyle. It has small, sturdy fingers adapted for pulling grass and narrow, small incisors adapted for chewing it. The <b>gelada</b> {{has a unique}} gait, known as the shuffle gait, that it uses when feeding. It squats bipedally and moves by sliding its feet without changing its posture. Because of this gait, the gelada's rump is hidden beneath and so unavailable for display; its bright red chest patch is visible, though.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the IUCN {{assessed}} the <b>gelada</b> as Least Concern, although their population had reduced from an estimated 440,000 in the 1970s to around 200,000 in 2008. It {{is listed in}} Appendix II of CITES. Major threats to the <b>gelada</b> are a reduction of their range {{as a result of}} agricultural expansion and shooting as crop pests. Previously, these monkeys were trapped for use as laboratory animals or hunted to obtain their capes to make items of clothing. As of 2008, proposals have been made for a new Blue Nile Gorges National Park and Indeltu (Shebelle) Gorges Reserve to protect larger numbers.|$|E
25|$|Geladas live in {{a complex}} {{multilevel}} society {{similar to that of}} the hamadryas baboon. The smallest and most basic groups are the reproductive units, which are made up of one to twelve females, their young and one to four males, and the all-male units, which are made up of two to fifteen males. The next level of <b>gelada</b> societies are the bands, which are made up of two to 27 reproductive units and several all-male units. Herds consist of up to 60 reproductive units that are sometimes from different bands and last for short periods of time. Communities are made of one to four bands whose home ranges overlap extensively. A <b>gelada</b> can typically live to around 20 years old.|$|E

50|$|The Bruce {{effect is}} also {{observed}} in deer-mice, meadow voles, collared lemmings, <b>geladas,</b> {{and it has}} also been proposed, but not confirmed, in other non-rodent species such as the lion.|$|R
25|$|Since 1979, it {{has been}} {{customary}} to place the <b>gelada</b> in its own genus (Theropithecus), though some genetic research suggests that this monkey should be grouped with its papionine (baboon) kin; other researchers have classified the species even farther distant from Papio. While Theropithecus <b>gelada</b> is the only living species of its genus, separate, larger species are known from the fossil record: T. brumpti, T. darti and T. oswaldi, formerly classified under genus Simopithecus. Theropithecus, while restricted at present to Ethiopia, is also known from fossil specimens found in Africa and the Mediterranean into Asia, including South Africa, Malawi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Algeria, Morocco, Spain, and India, more exactly at Mirzapur, Cueva Victoria, Pirro Nord, Ternifine, Hadar, Turkana, Makapansgat and Swartkrans.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia is an ecologically diverse country, {{ranging from}} the deserts along the eastern border to the {{tropical}} forests {{in the south to}} extensive Afromontane in the northern and southwestern parts. Lake Tana in the north {{is the source of the}} Blue Nile. It also has a large number of endemic species, notably the <b>gelada,</b> the walia ibex and the Ethiopian wolf ("Simien fox"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.|$|E
25|$|Males {{can remain}} in a {{reproductive}} unit for four to five years. While geladas have traditionally been considered to have a male-transfer society, many males appear {{to be likely to}} return and breed in their natal bands. Nevertheless, <b>gelada</b> males leave their natal units and try to take over a unit of their own. A male can take over a reproductive unit either through direct aggression and fighting or by joining one as a subordinate and taking some females with him to create a new unit. When more than one male is in a unit, only one of them can mate with the females. The females in the group together can have power over the dominant male. When a new male tries to take over a unit and overthrow the resident male, the females can choose to support or oppose him. The male maintains his relationship with the females by grooming them rather than forcing his dominance, in contrast to the society of the hamadryas baboon. Females accept a male into the unit by presenting themselves to him. Not all the females may interact with the male. Usually, one may serve as his main partner. The male may sometimes be monopolized by this female. The male may try to interact with the other females, but they are usually unresponsive.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Geladas</b> {{are found}} only in the high {{grassland}} of the deep gorges of the central Ethiopian plateau. They live in elevations [...] above sea level, using the cliffs for sleeping and montane grasslands for foraging. These grasslands have widely spaced trees and also contain bushes and dense thickets. The highland areas where they live tend to be cooler and less arid than lowlands areas. Thus, the <b>geladas</b> usually do not experience the negative effects that the dry season has on food availability. Nevertheless, in some areas, they do experience frost in the dry season, as well as hailstorms in the wet season.|$|R

40|$|Here,we provide {{quantitative}} data concerning adult and immature play distribution in <b>geladas</b> discussing {{the results in}} the light of their social dynamics. Sex differences in immature play does not seem to reflect sex differences in adult role; in fact, frequency, modality (C-play and LR-play), and motivation (measured by play initiations) to play did not vary according to the different sex–class combinations. The occurrence of adult–adult play suggests that <b>geladas</b> are characterized by an apparent more than actual rigidity in their social relationships and this is particularly evident in females which show peculiar traits in the use of social play. Specifically, adult females played with other adult females as much as with immature ones, thus suggesting their high motivation to engage in such interactions. This adult play behavioural pattern is typical of species showing relaxed/fluid more than despotic/rigid social relationships. Such assumption is also supported by the positive correlation observed between play and affinitive behaviours (grooming and agonistic support) found within each age-category (adult females and immature subjects). This evidence, together with the lack of correlation between aggressive contacts and social play, suggests that <b>geladas</b> use play for social assessment purposes and/or to increase their social affiliation levels...|$|R

2500|$|The <b>gelada</b> (Theropithecus <b>gelada,</b> [...] ), {{sometimes}} called the bleeding-heart monkey or the <b>gelada</b> baboon, is a species of Old World monkey found only in the Ethiopian Highlands, with large populations in the Semien Mountains. Geladas are actually not baboons ("baboons" [...] are all taxonomic members of the genus Papio) but {{members of their own}} genus Theropithecus. Theropithecus is derived from the Greek root words for [...] "beast-ape." [...] Like its close relatives the baboons (genus Papio), it is largely terrestrial, spending much of its time foraging in grasslands.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers {{from the}} University of the Free State (UFS) in South Africa, while observing <b>gelada</b> during field studies, {{discovered}} that the monkeys were capable of 'cheating' on their partners and covering up their 'infidelity'. A non-dominant male would mate surreptitiously with a female, suppressing their normal mating cries {{so as not to}} be overheard. If discovered, the dominant male would attack the miscreants in a clear form of punishment. It is the first time that evidence of the knowledge of cheating and fear of discovery has been recorded among animals in the wild. Dr. Aliza le Roux of the university's Department of Zoology and Entomology believes that dishonesty and punishment are not uniquely human traits, and that the observed evidence of this behaviour among <b>gelada</b> monkeys suggests that the roots of the human system of deceit, crime and punishment lie very deep indeed.|$|E
40|$|Since Sugiyama's [1965] first {{observations}} of infanticide, empirical evidence from {{a multitude of}} primate species has supported the sexual selection hypothesis—the idea that males enhance their reproductive success by killing nonrelated, unweaned infants to hasten the mothers' return to fertility. Like other primates that live in social groups where paternity certainty is high, the social structure of <b>geladas</b> [Theropithecus gelada] suggests that infanticide by males could enhance their reproductive success. Nevertheless, empirical evidence for infanticide in this species is limited to anecdotal accounts. Using the timing of infant mortality and female reproductive and behavioral data collected across 26 months from a population of <b>geladas</b> living in the Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia, we test whether sexually selected infanticide occurs in this species. We also examine two additional hypotheses [noninfanticide hypothesis and generalized aggression hypothesis] for this population. Results suggest that sexually selected infanticide in <b>geladas</b> may, indeed, {{be a threat to}} females with dependent infants. First, male takeovers—the most likely time for infanticide—were associated with subsequently elevated rates of infant death [a 32 -fold increase] comprising nearly 60 % of all infant mortality. Second, females who lost infants during this period returned to fertility more quickly than if infants had lived [IBIs were 50 % shorter], and third, all of these females were observed to mate with the new male. We found little to no support for other hypotheses. Finally, these results raise the possibility that anecdotal reports [from previous studies and this study] of pregnancy termination, accelerated weaning, and deceptive sexual swellings may represent female counterstrategies to male infanticide in <b>geladas.</b> Am.

2500|$|The <b>gelada</b> {{is large}} and robust. It is covered with buff to dark brown, coarse hair and has a dark face with pale eyelids. Its arms and feet are nearly black. Its short tail ends in a tuft of hair. Adult males have a long, heavy cape of hair on their backs. The <b>gelada</b> has a hairless face with a short muzzle that is closer to a chimpanzee's than a baboon's. It can also be {{physically}} distinguished from a baboon by the bright patch of skin on its chest. This patch is hourglass-shaped. On males, it is bright red and surrounded by white hair; on females, it is far less pronounced. However, when in estrus, the female's patch will brighten, and a [...] "necklace" [...] of fluid-filled blisters forms on the patch. This {{is thought to be}} analogous to the swollen buttocks common to most baboons experiencing estrus. In addition, females have knobs of skin around their patches. Geladas also have well developed ischial callosities. There is sexual dimorphism in this species: males average 18.5kg (40.8lb) while females are smaller, averaging 11kg (24.3lb). The head and body length of this species is 50–75cm (19.7–29.5in) for both sexes. Tail length is 30–50cm (11.8–19.7in).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to observe and analyse the main daily {{activities}} {{in the group of}} <b>geladas</b> kept in the Zlín Zoo. The experimental group was formed by three males (one of them was a dominant alfa male) and four females who were in the reproductive cycle at the observation period. The behavioural study included five recurrent observations which took place in March 2014. The observations revealed that <b>geladas</b> spent most of the time feeding (44. 1 %) and performing comfort behaviour (24. 6 %). About 7. 7 – 10. 4 % of the total time the <b>geladas</b> spent moving, resting and observing the neighbourhoods. The settled and stable social hierarchy within the group prevented greater incidence (0. 7 %) of aggressive behaviour. Occurrence of other types of activities was low – play (1. 7 %), climbing the trees (0. 5 %) and sexual behaviour (2. 3 %). The work also studied how the incidence of a particular type of behaviour changed over time within the day. A certain pattern in behavioural activities was apparent because their incidence tended to be similar on all observation days. Foraging activities were the greatest (44. 80 ± 3. 64 observations) between 15. 00 and 16. 00, resting (8. 00 – 9. 80 observations) between 12. 00 and 14. 00 and comfort behaviour (23. 20 ± 2. 82 observations) in the morning...|$|R

40|$|Here, {{we tested}} {{hypotheses}} {{about the potential}} functions of yawning based on its intensity and social contexts. Due to their spectrum intensity of yawns (covered teeth/YW 1; uncovered teeth/YW 2; uncovered gums/YW 3), <b>geladas</b> are a good model species for this purpose. We suggest that yawns of different intensity can bear different information according to the performer, the context and the behavioural pattern temporally associated to the yawn event. YW 3, mainly performed by high ranking males during periods of high social tension, was frequently associated with an auditory component and often accompanied by scratching (a measure of anxiety). YW 1 and YW 2, preferentially performed by females, were frequently associated to lip smacking, an affiliative display. In conclusion, even though a clear-cut functional distinction of <b>geladas</b> 2 ̆ 7 yawn intensity is difficult, YW 1 and YW 2 {{seem to be more}} linked to affiliative social interactions; whereas, YW 3 seems to be more linked to agonistic and tension situations...|$|R
2500|$|Adult geladas use {{a diverse}} {{repertoire}} of vocalizations for various purposes, such as: contact, reassurance, appeasement, solicitation, ambivalence, aggression and defense. The level of complexity of these vocalizations {{is thought to}} near that of humans. They sit around and chatter at each other, signifying to those around that they matter, in a way, to the individual [...] "speaking". To some extent, calls {{are related to the}} status of an individual. In addition, females have calls signaling their estrus. Geladas communicate through gestures, as well. They display threats by flipping their upper lips back on their nostrils to display their teeth and gums, and by pulling back their scalps to display the pale eyelids. A <b>gelada</b> submits by fleeing or presenting itself.|$|E
2500|$|Theropithecus <b>gelada</b> is a wild primate that {{demonstrates}} cryptic female choice through a gestation mechanism. The females {{have been reported}} to have a strong Bruce effect. Bruce effect is when the female terminates the pregnancy when she is exposed to an unrelated male. This effect is illustrated by the results shown in the graph to the right. Female gelada's terminate about 80% of their pregnancies the week after the dominant male has been replaced. This could be because males typically perform infanticide when they take over a new group. [...] Terminating a pregnancy could be a female's way to protect herself and avoid infanticide of her young. [...] Studies have been shown to support the hypothesis that the Bruce effect can be an adaptive strategy for females.|$|E
