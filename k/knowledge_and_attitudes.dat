This study aimed to evaluate the <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> of females on CVDs risk factors and also the relationship between <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> with obesity indices and biochemical parameters. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 89 women with the age range of 11 to 67 y old and body mass index (BMI) of 24 to 51 kg/m 2. Participants were interviewed face to face using a valid questionnaire in order to evaluate their <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> on CVDs risk factors.
