6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all, then, Hawkins?" [...] {{asked the}} captain, with a troubled face. [...] "What {{is your own}} theory on the matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It assuredly is a mystery," [...] said Captain Putnam at last. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Mr. Strong?" [...] {{he asked}} {{of his second}} assistant.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child, the {{greatest}} statesmen {{have had their}} distractions. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> my hereditary talent? That's a tremendous force." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this, White Buffalo?" [...] asked Dave, {{after they}} had left the Indian village a goodly {{distance}} behind them.|$|R
6000|$|... "A jolly good morrow indeed," [...] said Sir John, {{turning a}} shade paler. [...] "And now, daughter, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this business?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This stumps me," [...] {{declared}} the senator's son. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it?</b> Do you think Shadow and Plum {{are up to}} something between them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is queer, {{to say the}} least," [...] remarked Tom as {{they came}} to a halt in a small clearing. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Dick?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{told the}} steward to prepare breakfast. Then we shall go back," [...] said I. [...] "But in God's name, Doctor Severall, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's mighty queer, {{to say the}} least," [...] {{observed}} Roger, {{after they}} had taken their departure. [...] "Dave, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Four times five will do handsomely, will it?" [...] said Mr. Jaggers, {{knitting}} his brows. [...] "Now, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> {{four times}} five?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} Mrs. Cavendish," [...] {{continued}} Poirot. [...] "That's another {{who is not}} telling all she knows! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> her attitude?" ...|$|R
6000|$|ADAM. I {{made the}} earth bring forth by my labor, {{and the woman}} bring forth by my love. And this is what has come of it. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Eve, my wife? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Gar'ner?" [...] Daggett demanded, {{a little}} impatiently. [...] "Water there must be; for no craft that floats could have stood such a squeeze, {{and not have}} her sides open." ...|$|E
6000|$|EVE. I nourished the egg in my {{body and}} fed it with my blood. And now they let it fall as the birds did, and suffer not at all. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Cain, my first-born? ...|$|E

6000|$|LILITH. I {{suffered}} unspeakably; I tore myself asunder; I lost my life, {{to make of}} my one flesh these twain, man and woman. And this is {{what has}} come of it. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Adam, my son? ...|$|E
6000|$|I cannot {{scan the}} words the scroll proclaims; [...] Peer as I will, these too quick-thronging dreads [...] Bring {{water to the}} eyes. Grant us, good Heaven, [...] That victory be where she is needed most [...] To prove Thy goodness!... What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|CAIN. I invented {{killing and}} conquest and mastery and the {{winnowing}} {{out of the}} weak by the strong. And now the strong have slain one another; and the weak live for ever; and their deeds do nothing for the doer more than for another. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> snake? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} devilish in this, Watson," [...] said he, more moved than I had ever before seen him. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Many things; {{more than}} I can tell you--things you've only {{to think of}} for yourself. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> all that I've done for myself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Austen," [...] he said, [...] "I am not at {{all sure}} that I have not brought you up on rather a fool's errand, but you seemed rather mystified {{yourself}} about these Deloras. Here's the cable from Dicky. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it?</b> Must have cost him something, extravagant young beggar!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know, Miss Porter," [...] {{replied the}} young man, [...] "unless we have {{discovered}} a runaway simian from the London Zoo who has brought back a European education to his jungle home. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Professor Porter?" [...] he added, turning to the old man.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her, with his {{colourless}} candour, {{still in his}} place; she moved about again, a little, emphasising by her unrest her declaration of her tranquillity. He was as silent, at first, {{as if he had}} taken her answer, but he was not to keep it long. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> that, by your own show, Charlotte couldn't tell her all? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> that the Prince didn't tell her anything? Say one understands that there are things she can't be told--since, as you put it, she is so easily scared and shocked." [...] He produced these objections slowly, giving her time, by his pauses, to stop roaming and come back to him. But she was roaming still when he concluded his inquiry. [...] "If there hadn't been anything there shouldn't have been between the pair before Charlotte bolted--in order, precisely, as you say, that there SHOULDN'T be: why in the world was what there HAD been too bad to be spoken of?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make,</b> Mr Nickleby,' said Tim, {{taking his}} pen {{out of his}} mouth, 'what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> four hundred and twenty-seven times three {{thousand}} two hundred and thirty-eight?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> hear that? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> hear that? There's {{my voice}} over there, and here I am here! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" [...] whispered Sticky-toes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never make}} {{exception}}s. An exception disproves the rule. Have {{you ever had}} occasion to study character in handwriting? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this fellow's scribble?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gone {{to dress}} for dinner, I suppose," [...] he continued. [...] "It must be getting late. I think I ought to be going, too, if you don't mind. The {{professor}} gets a little restive if I keep him waiting for his daily bread. Great Scott, that watch can't be right! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it?</b> Yes, so do I. I really think I must run. You won't mind. Good-night, then. See you to-morrow, I hope." ...|$|E
6000|$|Smoke pondered a few minutes, {{then again}} broke silence. [...] "Say, Shorty. Forty {{thousand}} dollars gold weighs two hundred pounds. Wild Water borrowed our sled and team to haul away his eggs. He {{came up the}} hill without a sled. Those two sacks of dust in his coat pockets weighed about twenty pounds each. The understanding was cash on delivery. He brought enough dust {{to pay for the}} good eggs. He never expected to pay for those three thousand. He knew they were bad. Now how did he know they were bad? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> anyway?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} how long ago you and I sat in the old Park at Burnmore, and how I kept pestering you and asking you {{what is all this}} for? And you looked at the question as an obstinate mule looks at a narrow bridge he could cross but doesn't want to. Well, Stephen, you've had nearly--how many years is it now?--to get an answer ready. What is it all for? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it?</b> Never mind my particular case, or the case of Women with a capital W, tell me your solution. You are active, you keep doing things, you find life worth living. Is publishing a way of peace for the heart? I am prepared to believe even that. But justify yourself. Tell me what you have got there to keep your soul alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The string is {{exceedingly}} interesting," [...] he remarked, {{holding it up}} to the light and sniffing at it. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this string, Lestrade?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> him?" [...] asked Cecilia, {{returning}} a {{short time}} afterwards from a visit of investigation as to the sufficiency of Bessie's bedclothes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lenore, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this?" [...] queried Anderson, {{turning to}} show her a small cake of some gray substance, soft and wet to the touch.|$|R
