40|$|In his July 1989 {{space policy}} speech, President Bush {{proposed}} a long range continuing commitment to space exploration and development. Included in his goals were {{the establishment of}} permanent lunar and Mars habitats {{and the development of}} extended duration space transportation. In both cases, a major issue is the availability of qualified sensor technologies for use in real-time monitoring and control of integrated physical/chemical/biological (p/c/b) Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS). The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the most promising <b>instrumentation</b> <b>technologies</b> for future ECLSS applications. The study approach is as follows: 1. Precursor ECLSS Subsystem Technology Trade Study - A database of existing and advanced Atmosphere Revitalization (AR) and Water Recovery and Management (WRM) ECLSS subsystem technologies was created. A trade study was performed to recommend AR and WRM subsystem technologies for future lunar and Mars mission scenarios. The purpose of this trade study was to begin defining future ECLSS instrumentation requirements as a precursor to determining the <b>instrumentation</b> <b>technologies</b> that will be applicable to future ECLS systems. 2. Instrumentation Survey - An instrumentation database of Chemical, Microbial, Conductivity, Humidity, Flowrate, Pressure, and Temperature sensors was created. Each page of the sensor database report contains information for one type of sensor, including a description of the operating principles, specifications, and the reference(s) from which the information was obtained. This section includes a cursory look at the history of instrumentation on U. S. spacecraft. 3. Results and Recommendations - <b>Instrumentation</b> <b>technologies</b> were recommended for further research and optimization based on a consideration of both of the above sections. A sensor or monitor technology was recommended based on its applicability to future ECLS systems, as defined by the ECLSS Trade Study (1), and on whether its characteristics were considered favorable relative to similar <b>instrumentation</b> <b>technologies</b> (competitors), as determined from the Instrumentation Survey (2).

The problem with the radiofrequency cavities is, that because of various factors (change in the environmental temperature, mechanical stress, [...] .), they are continuously frequency detuning. The consequence of the frequency detuning is that electromagnetic field in the cavity is not optimal for the acceleration of the particles. For this reason the resonant frequency of the cavities must be controlled so that it remains stable and {{as close to the}} nominal as possible. Because the above-mentioned factors are slow the problem can be solved with a slow control loop.
