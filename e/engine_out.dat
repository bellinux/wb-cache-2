5|$|On McGovern's December 15 mission over Linz, {{his second}} as pilot, {{a piece of}} {{shrapnel}} from flak came through the windshield and missed fatally wounding him by only a few inches. The following day {{on a mission to}} Brüx, he nearly collided with another bomber during close-formation flying in complete cloud cover. The following day, he was recommended for a medal after surviving a blown wheel on the always-dangerous B-24 take-off, completing a mission over Germany, and then landing without further damage to the plane. On a December 20 mission against the Škoda Works at Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, McGovern's plane had one <b>engine</b> <b>out</b> and another in flames after being hit by flak. Unable to return to Italy, McGovern flew to a British airfield on Vis, a small island in the Adriatic Sea off the Yugoslav coast that was controlled by Josip Broz Tito's Partisans. The short field, normally used by small fighter planes, was so unforgiving to four-engined aircraft that many of the bomber crews who tried to make emergency landings there perished. But McGovern successfully landed, saving his crew, a feat for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
5|$|While Final Fantasy XIII was in production, the {{development}} of Crystal Tools caused significant problems and delays. The programmers spent much time on taking all demands from staff into account. Based on this feedback, Murata's team tried to adapt the engine {{to the needs of}} several game projects, which proved to be virtually impossible and prevented the engine's specifications from being finalized. Furthermore, as separate groups were working on the individual tools of the engine, there was no comprehensive software documentation to ensure usability and compliance. Unable to wait any longer, the Final Fantasy XIII team {{had no choice but to}} begin creating assets to keep to the game's production schedule. However, the lack of specifications resulted in these assets being incompatible with the engine. In the end, it was decided that Final Fantasy XIII was to be the principal focus of Crystal Tools and the game's team began cooperating with the Research and Development Division more closely to receive the required tools and specifications. While preliminary support of Crystal Tools was developed for the Wii, the console did not fully support all components. In 2008, Murata said that Square Enix might license the <b>engine</b> <b>out</b> to other companies at some point in the future, although the limited documentation and the impracticality of supporting licensees posed great problems in doing so. Two years later, Final Fantasy XIII producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that developing an engine from scratch to go with a new game may have been a mistake and a likely cause for the long period between the title's announcement and release.|$|E

25|$|On November 10, 2013 a Metroliner {{operated}} by Bearskin Airlines under flight number JV311, crashed on final approach to its destination of Red Lake, Ontario, Canada {{en route from}} Sioux Lookout, Ontario. The aircraft experienced a near total failure of the left engine at 500ft AGL which, combined with the aircraft being in the landing configuration, caused a loss of airspeed resulting in an unrecoverable situation. Safety systems {{to assist in the}} handling with one <b>engine</b> <b>out</b> did not activate since the engine did not completely shut down; the scenario gave conflicting information to the pilots who did not have time to identify the nature of the failure. Two crew members and three passengers were killed in the crash. Two passengers sustained injuries but survived.|$|E
25|$|By 13:35, Winslow {{reached a}} point {{approximately}} 1,500 yards from her quarry when a white puff of smoke from Antonio Lópezs bow gun signaled {{the beginning of an}} artillery duel which lasted one hour and 20 minutes. Winslow responded with her 1-pounders. The Spanish concentrated their efforts on Winslow, and she soon received several direct hits. The first shot to score on the torpedo boat destroyed both her steam and manual steering gear. Her crew tried to rig an auxiliary steering system, but she swung broadside to the enemy and a shot pierced her hull near the engine room and knocked the port main <b>engine</b> <b>out</b> of commission. She maneuvered with her remaining engine to evade enemy fire and maintained a steady return fire with her 1-pounders. Wilmington and Hudson brought their guns to bear on the Spanish ship and shore, and the combined fire of the three American warships put the Spanish tugboat out of action while several waterfront buildings caught fire.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} 890 Meteors {{were lost in}} RAF service (145 of these crashes {{occurring}} in 1953 alone), resulting {{in the deaths of}} 450 pilots. Contributory factors in the number of crashes were the poor brakes, failure of the landing gear, the high fuel consumption and consequent short flight endurance (less than one hour), causing pilots to run out of fuel, and difficult handling with one <b>engine</b> <b>out</b> due to the widely set engines. The casualty rate was exacerbated by the lack of ejection seats in early series Meteors; the ground-breaking high speed that the aircraft was capable of meant that, during the bailing out process, pilots were typically subject to high g forces hindering movement and the effect of slipstream winds; there was also a greater likelihood of the pilot striking the horizontal tailplane. Ejection seats would be fitted in the later F.8, FR.9, PR.10 and some experimental Meteors. The difficulty of bailing out of the Meteor has been noted by pilots during development, reporting several contributing design factors such as the limited size and relative position of the cockpit {{to the rest of the}} aircraft, and difficulty in using the two-lever jettisonable hood mechanism.|$|E

2500|$|Three Go 242s were {{modified}} as prototypes of the powered Go 244, {{fitted with}} varying surplus radial engines. [...] The first prototype, the Go 244 V1 was powered by two 660hp (492kW) BMW 132, {{while the second}} prototype had 700hp (522kW) Gnome-Rhône 14Ms — and the third 750hp (560kW) Shvetsov M-25 A engines, with this model of Shvetsov OKB engine design being essentially a Soviet-built Wright Cyclone American-based nine-cylinder radial. [...] Although only the third prototype offered adequate <b>engine</b> <b>out</b> performance, the Luftwaffe had large stocks of captured Gnome engines, so this {{was chosen as the}} basis for the production conversion — usually fitted in counter-rotating pairs in production — although a few more aircraft were fitted with the BMW and Shvetsov engines.|$|E
2500|$|High {{aspect ratio}} wings give the U-2 some glider-like characteristics, with an <b>engine</b> <b>out</b> glide ratio of about 23:1, {{comparable}} to gliders of the time. To maintain their operational ceiling of , the early U-2A and U-2C models {{had to fly}} very near their never-exceed speed (VNE). The margin between that maximum speed and the stall speed at that altitude was only [...] This narrow window is called the [...] "coffin corner", [...] because breaching either limit would likely cause airflow separation at the wings or tail. For {{most of the time}} on a typical mission the U-2 was flying less than five knots above stall speed. A stall would cause a loss of altitude, possibly leading to detection and overstress of the airframe.|$|E
2500|$|The crew made {{no attempt}} to balance the airplane’s fuel load after the No. 1 engine failed. [...] The DC-6 is {{equipped}} with four main fuel tanks that serve individual engines, while a network of valves allow fuel to be transferred from one engine’s tank to feed other engines. The crew did not cross feed fuel from the tank serving the failed engine to balance the plane's weight as recommended in the flight operations manual. Flight 157 had flown for almost three hours with the No. 1 <b>engine</b> <b>out,</b> and the CAB concluded that the No. 1 main fuel tank was holding about 1,400lbs (635kg) more gasoline than the other three main tanks when the plane arrived at Love Field. The investigators primarily attributed the left wing’s sharp drop to the excessive weight of the fuel at its outboard end.|$|E
50|$|The crew {{decided to}} abandon the {{aircraft}} because it could not stay aloft with three <b>engines</b> <b>out</b> of commission while carrying a heavy payload. The atomic bomb was jettisoned and detonated in mid-air, resulting in a large conventional explosion over the Inside Passage. The USAF later stated that the fake practice core on board the aircraft was inserted into the weapon before it was dropped.|$|R

2500|$|The {{incident}} {{resulting in}} the single largest loss {{of life in the}} history of the US Navy not related to combat occurred when the collier Cyclops, carrying a full load of manganese ore and with one <b>engine</b> <b>out</b> of action, went missing without a trace with a crew of 309 sometime after March 4, 1918, after departing the island of Barbados. Although there is no strong evidence for any single theory, many independent theories exist, some blaming storms, some capsizing, and some suggesting that wartime enemy activity was to blame for the loss. In addition, two of Cyclopss sister ships, [...] and [...] were subsequently lost in the North Atlantic during World War II. Both ships were transporting heavy loads of metallic ore similar to that which was loaded on Cyclops during her fatal voyage. In all three cases structural failure due to overloading with a much denser cargo than designed is considered the most likely cause of sinking.|$|E

Unlike the A6 and S6, however, the RS6's engines in the C5 and C6 iterations have not been shared with any other vehicle in Audi's lineup. However, for the C7 generation, the Audi RS6 has the same 4.0L biturbo V8 engine as the Audi RS7, with both being positioned {{at the top of the}} Audi S and RS range, and detuned variants of the same engines are found in the Audi S8, Audi A8, and Audi S6.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{building}} of the two first aircraft began in December 1923, F.6 (III) being finished 30 May 1924 and F.12 in August the same year. The first aircraft were delivered with [...] Scania-Vabis engines, which proved too weak and was replaced with [...] Beardmore or Sunbeam engines. For the next two aircraft produced the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service (RNNAS) settled on a [...] Mercedes engine and aircraft with this engine were redesignated as M.F.8Bs. However, in 1932 Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk {{had to find a}} replacement for the Mercedes engines as spare parts became hard to procure. A Bristol Lucifer was borrowed from Kjeller Aircraft Factory and a Walter Regulus from a factory in Prague, were both tested at Horten. Still, both engines proved too costly to finance. Barely used Armstrong Siddeley Cheetah IIA engines were found in British surplus stockpiles and purchased for 500 Norwegian kroner apiece. After rebuilding with a larger propeller engine output was reduced from [...] to [...] making them suitable for a trainer, and these were fitted to both M.F.8 and M.F.10 trainers.
