40|$|The {{formation}} of aluminium-substituted iron-minerals is still subject to debate. We report {{a case study}} in a Humic Gleysol soil profile, developed on a sedimentary saprolite, from a basin floor on the Uberaba Plateau (Minas Gerais State, Brazil) where iron-phases are crystallized by a ferruginization process. The mineralogical and chemical properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and Mossbauer spectroscopy. The specific surface area (BET method) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were also determined. The soil profile is mainly composed of gibbsite, kaolinite and amorphous alumino-silicate phases, the latter being more frequent in the <b>H</b> <b>horizon</b> where the organic carbon content is greater. The surface area and CEC values are also greater in the <b>H</b> <b>horizon</b> (58. 6 m(2) g(- 1) and 4. 65 mol(c) kg(- 1), respectively) which indicates an increase in porosity caused by the presence of 20. 8 % of organic matter and amorphous materials. Goethite occurs as a secondary mineral in the <b>H</b> <b>horizon</b> and as the main mineral in the duricrust in association with haematite. The omnipresence of aluminium in the environment (24. 6 - 46. 2 % of Al 2 O 3) resulted in Al-substitution in all iron-bearing phases but the goethite from the <b>H</b> <b>horizon</b> has the greatest Al-for-Fe substitution, with at least 20 mole per cent of aluminium.

Throughfall was collected in open funnel collectors and soil solution was collected using tensionless tray lysime-ters {{at the base}} of the <b>H</b> <b>horizon</b> and ceramic cup suction samplers {{at the base of}} the B horizon. Sampling took place fortnightly for 14 months and samples were analysed for the major ions and dissolved organic carbon. Most ions were present in higher concentrations under spruce than larch.

However there were no trends in fortnightly concentrations of any ion, associated with the presence and absence of needles on the larch. When solutes are expressed as fluxes the only consistent effect of species on the B horizon is higher quantities of NO 3 and NH 4 under spruce. The study suggests that in areas exposed to atmospheric pollution, thinned stands of larch could have a beneficial role relative to Sitka spruce, in the maintenance of low acidity and aluminium concentrations in drainage water...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDynamics of C and N {{in forest}} soils in the Nutrient Cycling and Soil Acidification Model (NUCSAM) are {{described}} by the transformation and decomposition of three organic matter compartments, litter, fermented material and humic material. These three compartments are allocated to the morphological distinguishable L, F and H horizons of the organic layer. Changes in the pools of these organic compartments are described with first order equations for decomposition and transformation. Rate constants for decomposition and transformation were derived by calibrating the model to measured organic matter pools in organic layers of a chrono-sequence of five first succession Scots pine stands between 15 and 120 years old. Simulated pools of organic matter in the organic layers were in agreement with measured pools in the five pine stands, except for the first thirty years of the H-horizon. During this period, an increase in organic matter in the <b>H</b> <b>horizon</b> was simulated while no H horizons were observed in the field. The simulated total pool of organic matter in the organic layer agreed well with values from a field inventory in 20 other Scots pine stands, but the simulated distribution over the three horizons differed from the field measurements which varied among sites. For the Scots pine stands the model was able to simulate the organic matter accumulation in the top 40 -cm of the mineral soil; derived almost completely from fine root turnover. The accumulated pool of nitrogen in the organic layer was in agreement with measured pools for the oldest Scots pine stand but was too high for the younger stands.

The experimental pasture plot (40 m × 60 m) {{is located in}} the northern front range of the Swiss Alps on a 30 ° steep hillslope (1180 m a. s. l., 1500 + mm annual precipitation). A gleysol (H-Go-Gr) overlies weathered marlstone and conglomerate of subalpine molasse. We conducted sprinkling experiments on a subplot (10 m × 10 m) with variable rainfall intensities. During both experiments fluorescein line-tracer injections into the topsoil, and sodium chloride (NaCl) injections into the sprinkling water were used to monitor flow velocities in the soil. The observed flow velocities for fluorescein in the soil were 1. 2 and 1. 4 × 10 − 3 m s − 1. The NaCl breakthrough occurred almost simultaneously in all monitored discharge levels (0. 05, 0. 25 and 1 m depth), indicating a high infiltration capacity and efficient drainage of the soil. These initial observations suggested " transmissivity feedback ", a form of subsurface stormflow, as the dominant runoff process. However, the results of a brilliant blue dye tracer experiment completely changed our perceptions of the hillslope's hydrological processes. Excavation of the dye-stained soils highlighted the dominance of " organic layer interflow ", a form of shallow subsurface stormflow. The dye stained the entire <b>H</b> <b>horizon,</b> vertical soil fractures, and macropores (mostly worm burrows) up to 50 cm depth.

[...] Congreso, celebrado del 12 - 16 de noviembre 2006, en Indianápolis, USA. Synchrotron-based X-ray {{absorption}} {{near edge}} spectroscopy (XANES) at the S K-edge (2476 eV) is a powerful, non-invasive {{tool for the}} speciation of sulfur in soil. However, in many studies instead of bulk soil samples, which often yielded spectra which were too noisy to analyze, alkaline extracts or soil particle size fractions have been investigated, accepting that the S speciation of these fractions represents that of the bulk soil. To test that assumption we compared the S speciation as revealed by S K-edge XANES of bulk soil, humic acid, fulvic acid, and several particle size fractions from A horizons of two cropland Alfisols, from an O and a Bs horizon of a forested Spodosol, and from an <b>H</b> <b>horizon</b> of a peat bog. The XANES spectra at the K-edge of S (2476 eV) were acquired at beamline ID 21 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble/France. For all except one (Spodosol Bs) sample, the XANES spectra of the humic and the fulvic acid fractions differed considerably {{from those of the}} respective bulk soil, with the humic and fulvic acid fractions generally being depleted in reduced S (thiols, organic disulfide) and enriched in oxidized S (sulfone, sulfonate, ester sulfate). Also the spectra of most particle size fractions were clearly different from the spectrum of the respective bulk soil, with the clay fraction being enriched in oxidized S, and the sand fractions being enriched in reduced S. Our results show that neither the sulfur K edge XANES spectra of alkaline soil extracts, including humic and fulvic acids, nor those of the clay particle size fraction can be used as proxies for the S speciation of the original soil from which the fractions had been isolated.

Because of the strong increase of solar power generation the prediction of solar yields becomes more and more important. Electrical operators need an estimation of the future production. For nowcasting and short term forecasting, the usual technics based on machine learning need large historical data sets of good quality during the training phase of predictors. However data are not always available and induce an advanced maintenance of meteorological stations, making the method inapplicable for poor instrumented or isolated sites. In this work, we propose intuitive methodologies based on the Kalman filter use (also known as linear quadratic estimation), able to predict a global radiation time series without the need of historical data. The accuracy of these methods is compared to other classical data driven methods, for different horizons of prediction and time steps. The proposed approach shows interesting capabilities allowing to improve quasi-systematically the prediction.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{causality}} introduced by Wiener (1956) and Granger (1969) {{is defined in}} terms of predictability one period ahead. This concept can be generalized by considering causality at a given <b>horizon</b> <b>h,</b> and causality up to any given <b>horizon</b> <b>h</b> [Dufour and Renault (1998) ]. This generalization is motivated by the fact that, in the presence of an auxiliary variable vector Z, it is possible that a variable Y does not cause variable X at horizon 1, but causes it at <b>horizon</b> <b>h</b> > 1. In this case, there is an indirect causality transmitted by Z. Another related problem consists in measuring the importance of causality between two variables. Existing causality measures have been defined only for the horizon 1 and fail to capture indirect causal effects. This paper proposes a generalization of such measures for any <b>horizon</b> <b>h.</b> We propose nonparametric and parametric measures of unidirectional and instantaneous causality at any <b>horizon</b> <b>h.</b> Parametric measures are defined in the context of autoregressive processes of unknown order and expressed in terms of impulse response coefficients. On noting that causality measures typically involve complex functions of model parameters in VAR and VARMA models, we propose a simple method to evaluate these measures which is based on the simulation of a large sample from the process of interest. We also describe asymptotically valid nonparametric confidence intervals, using a bootstrap technique. Finally, the proposed measures are applied to study causality relations at different horizons between macroeconomic, monetary and financial variables in the U. S.

As these megaslides comprise two sets of stacked allochthonous masses within the Upper Miocene-Quaternary sedimentary record, they are now described as Mass-Transport Complexes (MTCs) and have been renamed the Amapá Megaslide Complex (AMC) and the Pará-Maranhão Megaslide Complex (PMMC). Individual megaslides of both MTCs can mobilize up to kilometre-thick sedimentary series as allochthonous masses with distinct flow directions, degrees of sediment disruption and internal coherence. Megaslides spread downslope over areas as large as thousands of km 2, attaining dimensions comparable to the world's largest mass-transport deposits. Among all the megaslides, the basal and largest AM 1 megaslide (AMC) stands as a quite unique example of mass-transport deposit in the basin, interpreted as a dominant carbonate allochthonous mass sourced from a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic platform. The instability was probably triggered between the late Miocene {{and the end of}} the Early Pliocene by the gravitational collapse of the mixed platform under its own weight, after successive subaerial exposures which generated karstification processes. Siliciclastic-type megaslides, on the other hand, are all sourced from large upslope slide and/or rotated blocks (up to 60 km wide in the case of the PMMC). The detachment of upslope blocks was triggered by structurally-induced seabed movements during the Mid Pliocene-Pleistocene (in the case of the PMMC) and during the Pleistocene (in the case of the AMC). All mapped features support the interpretation of sedimentary blocks which have undergone long lasting deformation, having been variably folded and faulted by the sliding along an overpressured condensed section (<b>H</b> 3 <b>horizon).</b> <b>H</b> 3 <b>horizon</b> equally acts as the upper décollement level for the gravity tectonic system that operates on the regional scale of the Foz do Amazonas basin.

Development of oil productions decreasing year-by-year, so that, new resources and advance production need to be processed immediately. Oil and gas resources in Indonesia still have a high potential to be developed, one of the high-potential location is Sumatera Island. Tectonic processes made the Tertiary-sedimentary basins {{in the back of}} volcanics arc (back arc basin) or in the eastern of Barisan Mountains. South Sumatera Basin was one of those sedimentary basin. Research area located in West Benakat, District of Muara Enim. Among various methods of oil and gas explorations, geoelectric method was chose for th research. This method is relatively simple and inexpensive in cost. Exploration was committed with geoelectric-Schlumberger configuration. Analysis processed with anistopy concept. Area of geoelectric measurements located in RA Field, Benakat Barat Area, South Sumatera. The length was various for each line depends on total of measurement stations. The distance between each measurement station is 100 meters with measurements extend 1000 meters in length for each station. Lines which analyzed in this research were line B, D, and J with 53 measurement stations in total, 20 in line B, 17 in line D, and 16 in line J. Data calculation processed with Microsoft Excel until value of medium resistivity acquired. After that, result from calculation processes will be used for 2 D modelling using Surfer 8. Based on data calculation and 2 D modelling, three hydrocarbon procpect horizons have been interpreted, they are <b>Horizon</b> <b>H</b> 1 in depth between 255 – 287 meters with medium resisitivity 0, 87 – 6, 27 Ohm meter, <b>Horizon</b> <b>H</b> 2 in depth between 462 – 483 meters with medium resistivity 2, 62 – 11, 58 Ohm meter, and <b>Horizon</b> <b>H</b> 3 in depth between 595 – 615 meters with medium resistivity 3, 04 – 16 Ohm meter...|$|R

Above all, {{by use of}} the spectral criterion of detectability, an extended Lyapunov stability theorem is developed for the concerned dynamics. Further, based on a game theoretic approach, a state-feedback H 2 /H∞ control design is proposed. It is shown that under the condition of detectability H 2 /H∞ feedback gain can be constructed through the solution {{of a group of}} coupled periodic difference equations...|$|R
40|$|A new Wind Speed Forecasting (WSF) model, {{suitable}} for a short term 1 - 24. <b>h</b> forecast <b>horizon,</b> is developed by adapting Hammerstein model to an Autoregressive approach. The model is applied to real data collected {{for a period of}} three years (2004 - 2006) from two different sites. The performance of HAR model is evaluated by comparing its prediction with the classical Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and a multi-layer perceptron Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Results show that the HAR model outperforms both the ARIMA model and ANN model in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). When compared to the conventional models, the new HAR model can better capture various wind speed characteristics, including asymmetric (non-gaussian) wind speed distribution, non-stationary time series profile, and the chaotic dynamics. The new model is beneficial for various applications in the renewable energy area, particularly for power scheduling...|$|R
40|$|Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Partially Observable MDP (POMDP) {{have become}} the model of choice in {{reinforcement}} learning. This work explores an interesting connection between mistake bounded learning algorithms and computing a near-best strategy, from a restricted class of strategies, for a given POMDP. We show that if a class of strategies has a mistake bound algorithm that makes at most d mistakes, then there is an algorithm to compute a near-best strategy from the class in time polynomial in 1 =ffl, the accuracy parameter, log(1 =ffi), the confidence parameter, <b>H,</b> the <b>horizon</b> parameter, and exponential in d, the mistake bound. Our transformation assumes only the ability to execute actions in the POMDP {{and the ability to}} reset the POMDP to its initial state. 1 Introduction Reinforcement learning addresses the following ambitious goal: How can an agent, wondering in a potentially unknown environment, maximize its long-term return.
