40|$|Poster session. Ben Tre, {{located on}} the Tien Delta Triangle [...] with a {{coastline}} of 65 km and the 20, 000 km 2 Exclusive Economic Zone [...] {{is one of the}} Mekong Delta’s 13 provinces. Given both its vast access to coastline and the EEZ, fisheries is one of the Ben Tre’s key economic sectors. This study specifies some factors affecting revenues of <b>trawling</b> and <b>light</b> purse seining vessels by using a multivariate regression model. Data was collected through direct and intensive interviews with vessel owners and fishermen. The results seem to demonstrate that single boat trawlers achieved the highest return on investment, followed by pairtrawlers and light purse seiners, respectively. Factors including the vessel length, engine capacity, captain’s experience, fishing gears, and vessel age have considerable effects on revenues of single-boat trawlers and lighted purse seiners. Based on these findings, this study provides some recommendations to offshore fisheries in Ben Tre province, Vietnam...|$|R
5|$|Halfbeaks {{are not a}} major {{target for}} {{commercial}} fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including seines and pelagic <b>trawls,</b> dip-netting under <b>lights</b> at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|R
40|$|Gonatus fabricii (hereafter gonatus) is a pelagic squid, widely {{distributed}} in boreal and subarctic waters. Material {{for the present}} investigation has been collected since 1970 mainly in the Norwegian Sea and adjacent areas during postlarval and 0 -group fish surveys during late summer and autumn. Earlier material used included stomach contents from hooded seals caught in the Jan Mayen area, and from bottlenose whales taken east of Iceland and off Labrador. Gonatus larvae were also taken in plankton net hauls at Station M at 66 ° 00 'N 02 ° 00 'E. Gonatus with mantle lengths 6 - 20 mm {{were found in the}} Norwegian Sea between December and July, 25 - 45 mm in February - September, and 55 - 100 mm in May - September and in December. Larger squid, mantle lengths 13 - 28 cm, were only taken from stomach contents of hooded seals and bottlenose whales. During 1978 gonatus with mantle lengths 15 - 45 mm were very abundant in the surface layers of the central and eastern Norwegian Sea during summer and autumn, up to 2000 specimens (5000 ml) were taken in half hour hauls with a Harstad trawl, 18 x 18 m opening. Juveniles also became stranded along the coast of eastern Finnmark in North Norway during the autumn. The correlation between rostral length (RL) of the beak and mantle length of gonatus has been roughly calculated. In stomach contents of bottlenose whales caught off Labrador during May - June 1967, the calculated mantle lengths of gonatus varied from 6 cm to 30 cm, mostly 13 - 28 cm. In the Norwegian Sea spawning and hatching of gonatus probably occur from December to July, with the peak in April - June. The main areas of spawning may coincide with localities where bottlenose whales are abundant as can be seen from catch statistics, e. q. off eastern Iceland, Møre, Vesterålen and West of Spitsbergen (Fig. 7). The life cycle of gonatus is probably closely connected to the current system of the Norwegian Sea and adjacent seas. A fishery for juvenile gonatus should be tried in these areas, chiefly during April - August, using <b>trawls,</b> <b>lights</b> and dip nets or pumps; for larger squid, jigging gear combined with lights should be used...|$|R

40|$|Over 1200 squids were {{captured}} by night <b>lighting,</b> <b>trawling,</b> or seining {{in the northern}} Gulf of Mexico for laboratory maintenance. Two types of recirculating sea water systems were designed and evaluated: a 2 m circular tank (1500 liter capacity) and a 10 m long raceway (10, 000 liters). Mean laboratory survival was: Loligo plei (12 to 252 mm mantle length, ML) 11 days, maximum 84 days; Loligo pealei (109 to 285 mm ML) 28 days, maximum 71 days; Lolliguncula brevis (27 to 99 mm ML) 19 days, maximum 125 days. Smaller squids showed significantly poorer survival than larger ones. All squids fed well {{on a variety of}} live estuarine fishes and shrimps. Growth rates depended upon stage of maturity. The highest rates were Loligo plei 59 mm/month (23. 8 g/mo), Loligo pealei 77 mm/mo (67. 3 g/mo), and Lolliguncula brevis 31 mm/mo (17. 2 g/mo). General aspects of behavior and body patterning were species-specific and were useful indices of the squids' condition. Key factors for laboratory survival were (1) prevention of skin damage, (2) tank systems with sufficiently large horizontal dimensions, (3) high quality water, (4) ample food supply, (5) no crowding, (6) maintaining squids of similar size to reduce aggression and cannibalism, and (7) segregating sexes to reduce aggression associated with courtship, mating, and egg laying...|$|R
40|$|One {{quarter of}} marine fish {{production}} is caught with bottom trawls and dredges on continental shelves around the world. Towed bottom-fishing gears typically kill 20 - 50 per {{cent of the}} benthic invertebrates in their path, depending on gear type, substrate and vulnerability of particular taxa. Particularly vulnerable are epifaunal species, which stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for benthic invertebrates. To identify the habitats, fisheries or target species {{most likely to be}} affected, we review evidence of the indirect effects of bottom fishing on fish production. Recent studies have found differences in the diets of certain species in relation to bottom fishing intensity, thereby linking demersal fish to their benthic habitats at spatial scales of ~ 10 km. Bottom fishing affects diet composition and prey quality rather than the amount of prey consumed; scavenging of discarded by-catch makes only a small contribution to yearly food intake. Flatfish may benefit from <b>light</b> <b>trawling</b> levels on sandy seabeds, while higher-intensity trawling on more vulnerable habitats has a negative effect. Models suggest that reduction in the carrying capacity of habitats by bottom fishing could lead to lower equilibrium yield and a lower level of fishing mortality to obtain maximum yield. Trawling effort is patchily distributed - small fractions of fishing grounds are heavily fished, while large fractions are lightly fished or unfished. This patchiness, coupled with the foraging behaviour of demersal fish, may mitigate the indirect effects of bottom fishing on fish productivity. Current research attempts to scale up these localized effects to the population level...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThis thesis work is {{performed}} {{to study and}} understand the pipeline global response {{as a result of}} trawl gears pull-over loads triggering lateral buckling on high temperature/high pressure subsea pipeline. The <b>external</b> interference from <b>trawl</b> gears pull-over loads may create substantial imperfection or out-of-straightness on the pipeline to trigger lateral buckling. The pull-over loads also may induce excessive bending moments and strains in the buckle region. To be able to understand the global response of the pipeline under pull-over loading condition, a finite element analysis is carried out based on DNV OS F 101 [1], DNV RP F 110 [2] and DNV RP F 111 [1]. The analysis is carried out using general finite element analysis software ANSYS v 13. Nonlinear-transient analysis is used to incorporate the non-linear effects, such as the nonlinearities of pipeline material, and the response of a structure under the action of pull-over time-dependent loads. The finite element analysis covers two period of duration i. e. during pull-over loads duration and after pull-over loads duration. The analysis during pull-over loads duration deals with the pipeline global response as a result of trawl gears pull-over loads. The pipeline is subjected to substantial horizontal and vertical pull-over forces from the trawl gears. The pull-over forces are applied based on force-time history as recommended in DNV RP F 111 [3]. This thesis work also study the pipeline post buckling condition. After pull-over loads duration, the pipeline global response may be different. The analysis is carried out for additional 5 seconds from the end of pull-over loads duration. In this period, the pull-over loads are no longer applied. The pipeline may expand further more caused by temperature and pressure loads on pipeline. There are four (4) types of trawl gear considered in the analysis i. e. polyvalent and rectangular trawl gear, industrial v-board, beam trawl and clump weight. All the trawl gears data are taken from DNV RP F 111 [3]. The thesis work calculates the pull-over loads and durations from all type of trawl gears. In the finite element analysis, only the pull-over loads from polyvalent and rectangular trawl gear are used as this is considered to adequately represent the cases. The finite element analysis of trawl gear pull-over shows the trawl gears pull-over loads induces lateral buckling on pipeline. The pipeline deform laterally at the pull-over loads location. High bending moments and strain occur at the apex of the buckle. The DNV displacement condition code check shows that the integrity of the pipeline is not satisfy the safety level hence the pipeline cannot withstand the trawl gears pull-over loads. The analysis with variation of operating temperature and pressure should be carried out as further works. The further works shall also take into account a full comparison of lateral and axial soil friction combination. This way, a more accurate result can be obtained and better conclusion can be verified...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impacts of the {{demersal}} trawl fishery on infaunal, epifaunal and fish assemblages in the southern Benguela upwelling system for the first time. In the absence of representative areas of similar habitat protected from trawling in the southern Benguela region, infaunal and epifaunal assemblages were compared between heavily and lightly trawled areas to assess {{the impacts of}} the otter-trawl fishery. Infauna were sampled at four sites, from southern Namibia to near Cape Town by means of five replicate grab samples at each paired heavily and lightly trawled area. Invertebrate epifauna were sampled at two sites in heavily and lightly trawled areas using a finemeshed otter trawl. Sites ranged in depth from 350 - 450 m in unconsolidated sediment habitat. Epifaunal assemblages showed greater differences at heavily trawled areas with significantly reduced species diversity, average number of species and individuals. Several epifaunal species were absent from heavily trawled areas highlighting their vulnerability to impacts of trawling. Multivariate analyses show significant differences in composition of both infaunal and epifaunal assemblages among the sites and between trawling treatments at all sites. The {{results of this study}} suggest that intense trawling activities are at least partially responsible for significantly altering benthic community composition, affecting epifauna to a greater measurable extent than infauna. Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) was used to explore potential changes in ecological functioning of benthic assemblages, comparing areas exposed to heavy and <b>light</b> <b>trawl</b> intensities in the Benguela system. BTA incorporates biological traits (life-history, morphology and behaviour) of infaunal and epifaunal species with biomass, capturing a broad range of information of marine benthic assemblages. Seventeen percent of the infaunal traits analysed showed a significant difference between heavily and lightly trawled areas. Twenty-four percent of epifaunal biological traits investigated were significantly different between areas of heavy and <b>light</b> <b>trawling.</b> This study suggests that more intense trawling modifies some trait constituents of the benthic assemblage in the southern Benguela region, confirming the sensitivity of functional traits analysis in detecting changes induced by trawling disturbance. Biological traits analysis of benthic invertebrates shows promise as a practical technique for incorporation into monitoring programmes and for developing indicators of benthic ecosystem health, needed for implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management in South Africa. A lack of representative untrawled areas in the trawl grounds of southern Africa precluded investigations comparing trawl impacts with unfished reference sites. A bilateral agreement between South Africa and Norway (NORSA) provided the opportunity to conduct experiments in an untrawled area of Oslofjord, Norway, where a shrimp trawl fishery for Pandalus borealis operates nearby. Infauna Abstract 2 were sampled at four untrawled sites in Oslofjord with five replicate grabs after which an Agassiz beam sled was dragged across two of the sites (impact sites) four times, simulating a trawl disturbance. Infauna were re-sampled at all four sites immediately after trawling (post-impact), 14 days and 64 days after the impact to monitor recovery of infaunal populations. Multivariate analyses comparing the impact sites with paired control sites for each sampling occasion showed no significant differences in infaunal assemblages at any stage of the experiment. Whilst it is considered possible that the trawl simulation was not a sufficient impact to represent that of a commercial trawl effect, it is considered more likely that trawl activities in Oslofjord do not inflict measurable impacts on infaunal assemblages. However, the impact of trawling on epifaunal assemblages in Oslofjord was not investigated in this study. Annual research survey data collected over the past 24 years (1986 - 2009) provide an opportunity to explore long-term demersal fish assemblage composition changes on the west coast of South Africa. Differences in spatial (latitude and depth) and temporal (seasonal and annual) factors were examined using multivariate analyses. Possible long-term changes were investigated using the Sequential T-test Algorithm to detect Regime Shifts (STARS). Results indicate geographic differences in fish assemblage composition from the northern to the southern region on the west coast of South Africa. The fish community composition is also clearly influenced by depth with a distinct change in fish assemblages in the shelf break region between 300 m and 400 m. Multivariate analyses also show two clear temporal changes in assemblage composition, firstly, in the early 1990 s and secondly, in the mid- 2000 s. STARS analyses detect long-term shifts in 27 % of demersal species with the majority of speciesâ shifts detected either in the early- to mid- 1990 s or in the past decade (2002 to 2009). Multivariate analyses among year groups reveal an increase in three fast-growing, early maturing species and decreases in two slow-growing, long-lived species. STARS analysis detected increases in two of the same fast-growing species, decreases in an additional four slow-growing, long-lived species, but four other slow-growing, long-lived species showed the opposite trend (i. e. increases). The hypothesis of an increase in fast-growing, early maturing species and a decline in slow-growing, longlived species in fished systems is therefore only partially supported by these findings. Shifts in demersal fish assemblages coincide temporally with spatial shifts observed in small pelagic species and west coast rock lobster. The shifts in the demersal fish assemblage composition detected in this study are probably a reflection of long-term indirect effects of fishing in combination with environmental changes. Abstract 3 The response of benthic invertebrate assemblages to two levels of fishing intensity in the southern Benguela region justifies regular monitoring of epifauna during existing annual demersal research surveys and infaunal monitoring through dedicated, periodic sampling initiatives. Demersal fish assemblage data should be regularly assessed for changes in community composition. Representative protected areas can serve as reference areas against which fishing impacts could be assessed and improve our understanding of ecosystem effects of demersal fishing...|$|R
