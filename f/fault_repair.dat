40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} on-line {{fault detection}} and <b>fault</b> <b>repair</b> capability of our Unitronics architecture, {{based on a}} bio-inspired prokaryotic bacterial colony model. At the device programming level, it appears as a cellular FPGA-like system; however, underlying structures transpose it into an inherently self-healing and fault tolerant electronics system. An e-puck object avoidance robot controller was built to demonstrate all the underlying theories of our research. The robot successfully demonstrated that {{it was able to}} cope with multiple, simultaneously occurring faults on-line whilst the robot was being controlled to move in a „figure 8 ‟-like manner. Integrity of the system is continuously monitored on-line, and if a fault is detected its location is automatically identified. Detection will trigger an on-line self-repair process. The amount of repair only depends on the number of spare cells the system is equipped with. The embedded <b>fault</b> <b>repair</b> mechanism uses significantly less memory for gene storage and considerably less hardware overall for target system implementation than any previously proposed bio-inspired architecture...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{studies of}} DRAM {{failures}} in data centers and supercomputer environments have highlighted non-uniform failure modes in DRAM chips. Failures fall into different classes {{depending on the}} source of the failure (e. g., an I/O pin, rank, bank, row, column, or bit). These failures will be common in future memory technologies. To mitigate them, memory systems employ complex error correcting codes and <b>fault</b> <b>repair</b> mechanisms. One way to evaluate the relative potency of these mechanisms is with analytical models, which are time-consuming to derive. Therefore, we propose FaultSim, a configurable memory-reliability simulation tool for 2 D and 3 D-stacked memories. FaultSim uses Monte Carlo methods, real-world failure statistics and novel algorithms to accelerate evaluation of different resilience schemes. Using multi-granularity failure rates from field studies with BCH- 1 (SECDED) and ChipKill codes, simulated results are within 0. 41 % and 1. 13 % of an approximate analytical model, respectively.
