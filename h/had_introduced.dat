5|$|Several {{members of}} the royal family were viewers of Last of the Summer Wine. While {{presenting}} an OBE to Roy Clarke in 2002, Prince Charles said that his grandmother, the Queen Mother, <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> him to the show. The Queen told Dame Thora Hird during a 2001 meeting that Last of the Summer Wine was her favourite television programme.|$|E
5|$|According to Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, Torbiner's {{records show}} that Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration of drugs in house calls, where he mostly gave patients morphine and Demerol. His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, {{but he had not}} adhered to those restrictions. For instance, he had given general anesthetic to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time Crimean Tatars devastated Russian territories and burned and looted Moscow during the Russo-Crimean Wars. Drought and {{epidemics}} had fatally affected the Russian economy while oprichnina had thoroughly disrupted the government. Following the defeat of Crimean and Nogai forces in 1572, oprichnina was wound down {{and with it the}} way Russian armies were formed also changed. Ivan IV <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> a new strategy whereby he relied on tens of thousands of native troops, Cossacks and Tatars instead of a few thousand skilled troops and mercenaries, as was the practice of his adversaries.|$|E

5|$|By 1912, 239 {{political}} parties {{at both the}} state and national level had pledged some form of direct election, and 33 states <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> the use of direct primaries. Twenty-seven states had called for a constitutional convention on the subject, with 31 states needed to reach the threshold; Arizona and New Mexico each achieved statehood that year (bringing the total number of states to 48), and were expected to support the motion. Alabama and Wyoming, already states, had passed resolutions in favor of a convention without formally calling for one.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{claimed that}} his new coach <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> him to Conte {{as a way of}} {{providing}} him with specialised 'nutritional supplements' - which he took by putting a few drops of liquid under his tongue. Conte had helped develop a type of anabolic steroid called THG, or tetrahydrogestrinone, at BALCO. After Chambers discovered that he had tested positive for drugs he sent his lawyer to meet Conte and make inquires about the supplement he had been ingesting. Conte assured him that all the substances were IAAF compliant.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Charles I, the gentry took an {{increased}} interest as patrons and occasionally as players. A big attraction for them was the opportunity that the game offered for gambling and this escalated {{in the years following}} the Restoration when cricket in London and the south-eastern counties of England evolved into a popular social activity. Its patrons staged lucrative eleven-a-side matches featuring the earliest professional players. Meanwhile, English colonists <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> cricket to North America and the West Indies, and the sailors and traders of the East India Company had taken it to the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
50|$|Combo-cameras combine full-feature still {{cameras and}} camcorders {{in a single}} unit. The Sanyo Xacti HD1 was the first such unit, {{combining}} the features of a 5.1 megapixel still camera with a 720p video recorder with improved handling and utility. Canon and Sony <b>have</b> <b>introduced</b> camcorders with still-photo performance approaching that of a digicam, and Panasonic <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> a DSLR body with video features approaching that of a camcorder. Hitachi <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> the DZHV 584E/EW, with 1080p resolution and a touch screen.|$|R

5|$|Goliath is a clone {{after the}} Bolliger & Mabillard's Batman model. The {{original}} was introduced 1992 {{and became a}} huge success where multiple parks introduced the same model to their lineup. The Batman model can be found all over the world. Goliath is different then the rest as the roller coaster mirrored from the other clones. Goliath {{is not the only}} Batman model in San Antonio as SeaWorld <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> one first in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Gregg Allman became {{interested}} in the Hammond after Mike Finnigan <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> him to Jimmy Smith's music, and started to write material with it. His brother Duane specifically requested he play the instrument when forming the Allman Brothers Band, and he was presented with a brand new B-3 and Leslie 122RV upon joining. Allman recalls the instrument was cumbersome to transport, particularly on flights of stairs, which often required the whole band's assistance. Author Frank Moriarty considers Allman's Hammond playing a vital ingredient of the band's sound.|$|E
5|$|Hershey's {{experience}} with Scorsese {{was extended to}} another major role for her 16 years later in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) as Mary Magdalene. During the filming of Boxcar Bertha, Hershey <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> Scorsese to the Nikos Kazantzakis novel on which the latter film was based. That collaboration resulted in an Academy Award nomination for the director and a Golden Globe nod for Hershey.|$|E

5|$|In 1190, York Castle was the {{location}} {{of one of the}} worst pogroms in England during the medieval period. The Normans <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> , where some occupied a special economic role as moneylenders, an essential but otherwise banned activity. English Jews were subject to considerable religious prejudice and primarily worked from towns and cities in which there was a local royal castle that could provide them with protection in the event of attacks from the majority Christian population. Royal protection was usually granted as the Norman and Angevin kings had determined that Jewish property and debts owed to Jews ultimately belonged to the crown, reverting to the king on a Jew's death.|$|E
5|$|In the {{administration}} of his diocese, Hugh introduced new methods of recording documents. This system was modelled on that which Hubert Walter <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> into the chancery, with separate registers for each archdeaconry, and registers, or rolls, for charters and memoranda, much like the Charter Roll or Memoranda Roll of the royal chancery. He also undertook {{a survey of the}} endowments of the vicarages within his diocese.|$|E
5|$|Kumaritashvili, {{who first}} began to {{participate}} in luge when he was 13, came {{from a family of}} seasoned lugers: his grandfather <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> the sport to the Soviet republic of Georgia, and both his father and uncle had competed when they were younger, with his uncle later serving {{as the head of the}} Georgian Luge Federation. Kumaritashvili himself began competing in the 2008–09 Luge World Cup. Kumaritashvili had also been a student at the Georgian Technical University, where he earned an economics degree in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{invention}} of pendulum clock, Huygens' spiral hairspring (balance spring) system of portable timekeepers, helped lay the foundations for the modern watchmaking industry. The application of the spiral balance spring for watches ushered {{in a new era}} of accuracy for portable timekeepers, similar to that which the pendulum <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> for clocks. From its invention in 1675 by Christiaan Huygens, the spiral hairspring (balance spring) system for portable timekeepers, still used in mechanical watchmaking industry today.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to writing}} the story, Hergé had read Balzac et son monde ("Balzac and His World"), a 1955 book written {{by his friend}} Félicien Marceau. Intrigued {{by the work of}} Honoré de Balzac, Hergé was {{inspired}} by the way in which Balzac <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> an array of characters from his earlier work into The Human Comedy, and he subsequently adopted this trait for The Red Sea Sharks, in which a wide range of characters from The Adventures of Tintin make a reappearance. Hergé also introduced a new character, the Estonian pilot Piotr Skut, who would later reappear in Flight 714 to Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Rodin's sister Maria, {{two years}} his senior, died of {{peritonitis}} in a convent in 1862. Rodin was anguished and felt guilty because he <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> Maria to an unfaithful suitor. Turning away from art, he briefly joined a Catholic order, the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder {{and head of}} the congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and, sensing his lack of suitability for the order, encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. He returned to work as a decorator, while taking classes with animal sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. The teacher's attention to detail– his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion– significantly influenced Rodin.|$|E

5|$|Soon thereafter, Atemengue {{was made}} {{chief of the}} local court, and Atangana was again {{appointed}} paramount chief (chef supérieur). He received {{a seat on the}} Council of Notables, a body the French <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> to act as liaisons to their subjects and advisors to the administration. Atangana set up a cabinet based on those he had observed in Spain, but he never allowed it to do much, and its members were not accustomed to European-style administration. It disbanded in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Strategic Air Command {{found itself}} in an uncomfortable position; bombers had been tuned for {{efficiency}} at high speeds and altitudes, performance that had been purchased at great cost in both engineering and financial terms. Before the B-70 was to replace the B-52 in the long-range role, SAC <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> the B-58 Hustler to replace the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in the medium-range role. The Hustler was expensive to develop and purchase, and required enormous amounts of fuel and maintenance {{in comparison to the}} B-47. It was estimated that it cost three times as much to operate as the much larger and longer-ranged B-52.|$|E
5|$|Tragedy struck on 1 January 1862, when Arthur Brittan {{drowned in}} the Avon River while {{learning}} to swim. He got entangled in watercress, which the Brittans themselves <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> to the Avon, {{and it took a}} half-hour for his body to be recovered. Arthur had left school by then and was helping his father on the farm. Joseph Brittan was heartbroken and there are indications that he went through a period of depression. Soon after the drowning, he advertised for both a dairyman and a farmworker, and even put Linwood House up for sale, though no property transaction was recorded.|$|E

50|$|Other {{utilities}} <b>have</b> <b>introduced</b> direct cash {{payments to}} needy families {{to help them}} pay their water bills. For example, the city of Brasilia <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> such a scheme. The Federal District pays the water utility an amount equivalent to the water and sewerage bills of poor families consuming less than 10 cubic meters per month. The State Water Company in Goiais <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> a similar program. In each case, about 20,000 families benefit from the program. However, not many municipalities in Brazil have the institutional capacity to administer such a targeted subsidy scheme.|$|R
