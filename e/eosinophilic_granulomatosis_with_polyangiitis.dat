25|$|ANCAs are {{associated}} with small vessel vasculitides including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis, primary pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (a type of renal-limited microscopic polyangiitis), <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> <b>with</b> <b>polyangiitis</b> (previously known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) and drug induced vasculitides. PR3 directed c-ANCA is present in 80-90% of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, 20-40% of microscopic polyangiitis, 20-40% of pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis and 35% of <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> <b>with</b> <b>polyangiitis.</b> c-ANCA (atypical) is present in 80% of cystic fibrosis (with BPI as the target antigen) and also in inflammatory bowel disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis and rheumatoid arthritis (with antibodies to multiple antigenic targets). p-ANCA with MPO specificity is found in 50% of microscopic polyangiitis, 50% of primary pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis and 35% of <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> <b>with</b> <b>polyangiitis.</b> p-ANCA with specificity to other antigens {{are associated}} with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, drug-induced vasculitis, autoimmune liver disease, drug induced syndromes and parasitic infections. Atypical ANCA is associated with drug-induced systemic vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also an}} {{autoimmune}} form of vasculitis, and is {{not associated}} with ANCA antibodies, unlike other vasculitic disorders associated with them (such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis and <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> <b>with</b> <b>polyangiitis).</b> This categorization is considered essential for appropriate treatment.|$|E
3000|$|Anti-neutrophil {{cytoplasm}} antibody (ANCA) associated Vasculitis (AAV) comprises 3 different clinical entities: <b>granulomatosis</b> <b>with</b> polyangiitis(GPA, formerly Wegener’s granulomatosis [...]), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and <b>eosinophilic</b> [...] <b>granulomatosis</b> <b>with</b> <b>polyangiitis</b> (EGPA, formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome [...]). These clinical syndromes {{are frequently}} (but not always) characterized by ANCA reactive {{against one of}} two antigens, proteinase- 3 (PR 3) or myeloperoxidase (MPO), the former more [...] commonly associated with GPA and the latter more frequently found in patients with MPA and EGPA (Finkielman et al. 2007). The genetic basis of these clinical and immunological AAV subsets have recently been described through genome wide association studies and appear to be different between PR 3 -and MPO-AAV, with the most significant associations with HLA genes, implicated in other autoimmune diseases. (Lyons et al. 2012) Clinically, AAV may rarely be associated with other immune mediated diseases, {{those that have been}} well recognized include anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease (Weber et al. 1992; Kalluri et al. 1997), scleroderma (Derrett-Smith et al. 2013), systemic lupus erythematosus(Tetikkurt et al. 2012) and membranous glomerulonephritis(Gaber et al. 1993; Tse et al. 1997). Knowledge of these overlap syndromes is important in early recognition of potential complications and differences in clinical courses and management pathways.|$|R
40|$|ANCA vasculitis: to lump or split? Why {{we should}} study MPA and GPA {{separately}} The {{three types of}} vasculitis associated with ANCA [ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) ] are <b>granulomatosis</b> <b>with</b> <b>polyangiitis</b> (Wegener’s) (GPA), microscopic polyan-giitis (MPA) and <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> <b>with</b> polyan-giitis (ChurgStrauss syndrome) (EGPA).

25|$|Perforated septum – The {{reconstruction}} of a saddle nose {{caused by a}} (collapsed) perforated septum, or by autoimmune problems such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), sarcoidosis, <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> <b>with</b> <b>polyangiitis</b> (EGPA), relapsing polychondritis, by intranasal drug use, and by excessive nasal aerosol use. The saddle nose deformity resulting from lost dorsum support is reconstructed using autologous bone grafts and rib cartilage grafts.|$|E
25|$|Granulomatosis with polyangiitis {{is part of}} {{a larger}} group of vasculitic syndromes called {{systemic}} vasculitides or necrotizing vasculopathies, all of which feature an autoimmune attack by an abnormal type of circulating antibody termed ANCAs (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) against small and medium-size blood vessels. Apart from GPA, this category includes <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> <b>with</b> <b>polyangiitis</b> (EGPA) and microscopic polyangiitis. Although GPA affects small- and medium-size vessels, it is formally classified as one of the small vessel vasculitides in the Chapel Hill system.|$|E

2500|$|Autoimmunity is {{the system}} of immune {{responses}} of an organism against its own healthy cells and tissues.

2500|$|Eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} {{is divided}} into different categories depending upon whether a cause can be determined or not.

[...] Idiopathic EP {{can be divided into}} [...] "acute eosinophilic pneumonia" [...] (AEP) and [...] "chronic eosinophilic pneumonia" [...] (CEP) depending on the symptoms a person is experiencing.|$|E
