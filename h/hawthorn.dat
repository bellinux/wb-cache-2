5|$|Romani people drove {{steel or}} iron needles into a corpse's heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth, over the eyes, ears {{and between the}} fingers {{at the time of}} burial.

5000|$|In {{spite of}} the club playing in the Premier League for all but four seasons since 2002, the {{capacity}} of The <b>Hawthorns</b> has been reduced over previous years due to a redevelopment of the West Stand (formerly the Halfords Land Stand).
