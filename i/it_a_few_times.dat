25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 208 experiments {{found that the}} mere-exposure effect is robust and reliable, with an effect size of r=0.26. This analysis found that the effect is strongest when unfamiliar stimuli are presented briefly. Mere exposure typically reaches its maximum effect within 10–20 presentations, and some studies even show that liking may decline after a longer series of exposures. For example, people generally like a song more after they have heard <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>times,</b> but many repetitions can reduce this preference. A delay between exposure and the measurement of liking actually tends to increase {{the strength of the}} effect. The effect is weaker on children, and for drawings and paintings as compared to other types of stimuli. One social psychology experiment showed that exposure to people we initially dislike makes us dislike them even more.|$|E
25|$|Matt Kenseth {{started on}} pole, but {{gave way to}} Brad Keselowski, who started on the front row and had the fastest car at the beginning. After he led 38 laps. Jimmie Johnson would take over the lead, leading 104 of the race's 200 laps. Many {{cautions}} waved during the race because of drivers repeatedly cutting down left side tires. Kenseth had the first pit box and would take advantage of <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>times,</b> {{coming out in the}} lead. Kenseth would lead three or four laps after the restarts, then Johnson would pass him as Kenseth's car faded back. With seven laps remaining, Johnson had a left-front tire go down, giving the lead to his teammate Jeff Gordon. Keselowski suffered his third left-rear tire failure a lap later but stayed out of harm’s way. The same fate befell Marcos Ambrose on the same lap. Gordon, who had a large lead, slowed his pace and almost made it to the finish, but Clint Bowyer spun with a lap and a half to go, thanks to a flat left-rear tire. The caution waved to set up the green-white-checker finish. On the restart, Gordon got shuffled back to finish in 13th. Kyle Busch passed Tony Stewart and Kurt Busch (both of whom only took two tires during pit stops), bringing rookie Kyle Larson with him. Kyle Busch held off Larson to win his first race of the year. Larson finished second and Kurt Busch finished third. Kenseth also passed Stewart on the last lap to finish in fourth. Stewart came home fifth.|$|E
500|$|Orbison did not {{authorize the}} use of the song or know {{it was going to be}} used, but {{the use of}} [...] "In Dreams" [...] proved {{beneficial}} to his career, which had stalled in the 1970s. BAM magazine called the song [...] "the emotional epicenter of the film". Orbison biographer Ellis Amburn called [...] "In Dreams" [...] deceptively simple and that it is used to significant effect in Blue Velvet because it suggests dreaming is preferable to waking, and power and control are the real themes of the song, instead of love, longing, and loss. The film made the song a cult favorite, and after seeing <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>times,</b> Orbison reconsidered his stance on its use. Footage of the film is featured in the 1987 music video of [...] "In Dreams", and interspersed with live action shots of Orbison's image projected over a filmy linen cloth blowing in the wind.|$|E

500|$|The {{variation}} with 7.Bg5 {{is named}} after Wolfgang Uhlmann, who played <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> in the 1960s. Botvinnik also employed it in his 1960 world championship match against Tal. By pinning the knight, White aims to transpose into favourable lines of the [...] of the King's Indian Defence, which may occur after 7...0-0 8.Nd2!. To prevent this, Black can either break the pin immediately with 7...h6 8.Bh4 g5 9.Bg3 Nh5, or after developing with 7...Bg7 8.e4 h6 9.Bh4. At this point 9...g5 10.Bg3 Nh5 runs into the pawn sacrifice 11.Bb5+ Kf8 12.e5! when White has a dangerous attack, and in the late 1970s this line was even thought to have refuted the Modern Benoni. Later it was realized that Black can prevent the bishop check with 9...a6!: the only way White can forestall ...g5 and ...Nh5 is with 10.Nd2, but this allows Black to expand on the queenside with 10...b5 and reach a satisfactory position.|$|E

[...] Chris Carter at Destructoid commented [...] "It's still a bit weird that something this goofy was removed, especially with the design Laura has in general," [...] and noted that a character like Necalli is [...] "probably far more harmful" [...] for children's eyes.

However, the song was a sales success in Canada, and peaked at number 5 on the Canadian magazine The Records single chart. The video for [...] "Jurassic Park" [...] received light rotation on MTV. Yankovic later explained {{in an interview that}} [...] " [...] played <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>times,</b> and then just yanked it, because it wasn't really part of their sound." [...] In contrast, the single was a success on The Box and they played it [...] "incessantly". Furthermore, in Canada, the song was a massive success on MuchMusic. Due to this, Alapalooza is Yankovic's best selling album in Canada, with over 200,000 units sold, according to Music Canada. However, the video was played and remained popular on VH1 well after its release; it ranked within the Top 50 Most-Played Clips during the months of August and September 1999, according to Billboard magazine. The video for [...] "Jurassic Park" [...] was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 37th Grammy Awards, but lost to the video for [...] "Love Is Strong" [...] by The Rolling Stones.

If the song sounds too far from our roots (or our sound or style) then we can tell after jamming <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>times,</b> and we either drop it or re-work it to sound more true to our roots. Satisfying ourselves creatively is pretty easy, as we aren't trying to re-invent the wheel musically - we are a blue-collar hard rock band. That said, we do side projects in which we can experiment with different textures and styles and scratch any itches to experiment in different genres." ...|$|E

60|$|Once {{the chance}} came as I was {{watching}} a muskrat at his supper. It was twilight in the woods. I had drifted in close to shore in my canoe to see what Musquash was doing {{on top of a}} rock. All muskrats have favorite eating places--a rock, a stranded log, a tree boll that leans out over the water, and always a pretty spot--whither they bring food from a distance, evidently for the purpose of eating it where they feel most at home. This one had gathered a half dozen big fresh-water clams onto his dining table, and sat down in the midst to enjoy the feast. He would take a clam in his fore paws, whack <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> on the rock till the shell cracked, then open it with his teeth and devour the morsel inside. He ate leisurely, tasting each clam critically before swallowing, and sitting up often to wash his whiskers or to look out over the lake. A hermit thrush sang marvelously sweet above him; the twilight colors glowed deep and deeper in the water below, where his shadow was clearly eating clams also, in the midst of heaven's splendor.--Altogether a pretty scene, and a moment of peace that I still love to remember. I quite forgot that Musquash is a villain. But the tragedy was near, as it always is in the wilderness. Suddenly a movement caught my eye on the bank above. Something was waving nervously under the bushes. Before I could make out what it was, there was a fearful rush, a gleam of wild yellow eyes, a squeak from the muskrat. Then Upweekis, looking gaunt and dark and strange in his summer coat, was crouched on the rock with Musquash between his great paws, growling fiercely as he cracked the bones. He bit his game all over, {{to make sure that it}} was quite dead, then took it by the back of the neck, glided into the bushes with his stub tail twitching, and became a shadow again.|$|E
