25|$|There is {{at least}} one {{recorded}} case of a small child dying within 15 minutes of a bite from a Sydney <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spider.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of severe envenomation, the time to onset of {{symptoms}} is less than one hour, with a study about <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spider</b> bites finding a median time of 28 minutes. This same study revealed that children are at a particular risk of severe funnel-web envenoming, with 42% of all cases of severe envenoming being children.|$|E
25|$|Current {{guidelines}} for antivenom recommend two vials, or four vials if symptoms of envenomation are severe. Patients are assessed every fifteen minutes, with further vials recommended if symptoms do not resolve. The most vials {{used to treat}} a bite is 12. The patient was a 10-year-old boy who was bitten in February 2017 by a male <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spider</b> hiding in a shoe.|$|E
25|$|When {{threatened}} or provoked, <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spiders</b> will display aggressive behaviour, rearing {{up on their}} hind legs and displaying their fangs. When biting, the <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spiders</b> maintain a tight grip on their victim, often biting repeatedly.|$|R
50|$|Eastern Mouse Spiders {{are often}} mistaken for Australian <b>Funnel-web</b> <b>Spiders.</b> The females {{are large and}} very strong, with {{powerful}} chelicerae. Their fangs often cross over slightly while those of Australian <b>Funnel-web</b> <b>Spiders</b> remain parallel, and the latter often have a drop of venom on their fang tips and have longer spinnerets.|$|R
5000|$|This {{group of}} spiders {{comprises}} mostly heavy bodied, stout legged spiders including tarantulas, Australian <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spiders,</b> mouse spiders, and various families of spiders commonly called trapdoor spiders.|$|R
25|$|The {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by a team headed by Struan Sutherland at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne. Since the antivenom became available in 1981, {{there have been no}} recorded fatalities from Sydney <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spider</b> bites. In September 2012, it was reported that stocks of antivenom were running low, and members of the public were asked to catch the spiders so that they could be milked for their venom. One dose of antivenom requires around 70 milkings from a spider.|$|E
25|$|The {{hobo spider}} (Eratigena agrestis, {{formerly}} Tegenaria agrestis) {{is a member}} of the genus of spiders known colloquially as funnel web spiders, but not to be confused with the Australian <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spider.</b> The medical significance of its bite is still poorly understood and debated. Individuals construct a funnel-shaped structure of silk sheeting and lie in wait at the small end of the funnel for prey insects to blunder onto their webs. Hobo spiders sometimes build their webs in or around human habitations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Funnel-web</b> <b>spider</b> venom {{contains}} a compound known as atracotoxin, an ion channel inhibitor, {{which makes the}} venom highly toxic for humans and other primates. However, it {{does not affect the}} nervous system of other mammals. These spiders typically deliver a full envenomation when they bite, often striking repeatedly, due to their defensiveness and large chitinous cheliceral fangs. There has been no reported case of severe envenoming by female funnel-web spiders, which is consistent with the finding that the venom of female specimens is less potent than the venom of their male counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Sydney <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spiders</b> {{are mostly}} {{terrestrial}} spiders, favouring habitats with moist sand and clays.|$|R
50|$|Caledothele is {{a spider}} genus in the <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spiders</b> of family Dipluridae found in Australia.|$|R

25|$|Most spiders do {{not cause}} bites {{that are of}} importance. For a bite to be significant, {{substantial}} envenomation is required. Bites from the widow spiders involve a neurotoxic venom which produces a condition known as latrodectism. Symptoms may include: pain which {{may be at the}} bite or involve the chest and abdomen, sweating, muscle cramps and vomiting among others. Bites from the recluse spiders cause the condition loxoscelism, in which local necrosis of the surrounding skin and widespread breakdown of red blood cells may occur. Headaches, vomiting and a mild fever may also occur. Other spiders that can cause significant bites include: the Australian <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spider</b> and South American wandering spider.|$|E
500|$|The main {{groups of}} modern spiders, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae, first {{appear in the}} Triassic well before [...] Some Triassic mygalomorphs appear {{to be members of}} the family Hexathelidae, whose modern members include the notorious Sydney <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spider,</b> and their spinnerets appear adapted for {{building}} funnel-shaped webs to catch jumping insects. Araneomorphae account for the great majority of modern spiders, including those that weave the familiar orb-shaped webs. The Jurassic and Cretaceous periods provide a large number of fossil spiders, including representatives of many modern families.|$|E
2500|$|... Atrax robustus is one {{of three}} species of the genus Atrax in the family Hexathelidae. The Sydney <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spider</b> shares its name with some members of the genus Hadronyche. It remains, {{together}} with the northern tree funnel-web, the only Australian <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spider</b> known to have inflicted fatal bites on humans.|$|E

2500|$|The Sydney <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spider</b> (Atrax robustus) is {{a species}} of venomous mygalomorph [...] spider native to eastern Australia, usually found within a [...] radius of Sydney.

2500|$|The {{bites of}} {{several species of}} mouse spider in Australia {{have been found to}} produce serious symptoms, similar to the Australasian <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spider.</b> However, serious envenomings are {{relatively}} rare; most mouse spider bites documented in the medical literature did not require use of antivenom or involve serious symptoms. The venom of the Eastern mouse spider (M. bradleyi) was found to have toxins similar to the robustoxin found in funnel-web venom; and funnel-web antivenom {{has been found to be}} effective in treating severe mouse spider bites. Unlike the funnel-web, however, the mouse spider is far less aggressive towards humans, and may often give [...] "dry" [...] bites.|$|E

2500|$|The Reverend Octavius Pickard-Cambridge was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the Sydney <b>funnel-web</b> <b>spider,</b> from a female specimen housed in the British Museum in 1877. Establishing the genus Atrax, he named it Atrax robustus. The species name is derived from the Latin robustus [...] "strong/sturdy/mature". Some years later, William Joseph Rainbow described a male Sydney funnel-web as a new species—Euctimena tibialis—from a spider he found under a log in Turramurra, and another from Mosman. He coined the scientific name from the Ancient Greek euktimenos [...] "well built" [...] and Latin tibialis [...] "of the tibia", having noted its prominent tibial spur. In the same paper, he described a female Sydney funnel web as yet another species—Poikilomorpha montana—from a specimen collected from Jamison Valley and Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains. Its species name was derived from poikilomorphia [...] "variety of form" [...] referring to the eyes of different sizes, and montana [...] "of the mountains". In February 1927, a young boy died after being bitten on the hand after playing with a big black spider on the laundry steps of his home in the Sydney suburb of Thornleigh. He fell gravely ill and perished later that evening. Public interest in spiders surged and the police brought the dead spider to the Australian Museum, which Anthony Musgrave [...] identified as Euctimena tibialis. He examined a series of male and female spiders collected around Sydney, and concluded that Euctimena tibialis was the male Atrax robustus due to anatomical similarities and after some males and females had been collected from the same locations.|$|E
