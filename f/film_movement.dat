5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the growing {{practice}} of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, {{with the goal}} of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of the Living Dead. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent <b>film</b> <b>movement.</b> The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.|$|E
5|$|The Kinetoscope is {{an early}} motion picture {{exhibition}} device. The Kinetoscope was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window {{at the top of}} the device. The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector, but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. A process using roll film first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor Louis Le Prince, the concept was also used by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1889, and subsequently developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892. Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph, an innovative motion picture camera with rapid intermittent, or stop-and-go, <b>film</b> <b>movement,</b> to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations.|$|E
5|$|The {{writing of}} Roa Bastos spans four countries, six decades, and countless genres. In his {{lifetime}} he made important contributions to Latin American Boom writing, to the related Dictator Novel, {{and to the}} Nuevo Cine <b>film</b> <b>movement</b> through screenplays like Alias Gardelito (1961). Roa Bastos' influence {{can be found in}} the works of many foreign post-boom writers, including Mempo Giardinelli, Isabel Allende, Eraclio Zepeda, Antonio Skármeta, Saul Ibargoyen, and Luisa Valenzuela. The most important author to come out of Paraguay, he also remains highly influential for a new generation of Paraguayan authors. Roa Bastos' relationship with his country, unbroken by over 40 years of exile, was considered so important that in 1989 he was invited back by Paraguay's new president, Andrés Rodríguez, following the collapse of the Stroessner regime.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in the mid-1970s, rival camera {{manufacturer}} Cinema Products {{began making}} lighter-weight 16mm film cameras using Auricon <b>film</b> <b>movements</b> and magnesium bodies, considerably easier to handle than the rugged solid-metal Auricons. After {{a year or}} two, Auricon cut off the supply of <b>film</b> <b>movements,</b> forcing Cinema Products {{to make their own}} mechanisms, which they could legally do because the Auricon patents were no longer valid. The Cinema Products CP-16 camera quickly became the standard 16mm film documentary camera over the next decade, until videotape began to curtail the use of 16mm film.|$|R

25|$|Unlike the French {{nouvelle}} vague, the Japanese movement initially began {{within the}} studios, albeit with young, and previously little-known filmmakers. The term was first coined within the studios (and in the media) as a Japanese {{version of the}} French New Wave movement. Nonetheless, the Japanese New Wave filmmakers drew {{from some of the}} same international influences that inspired their French colleagues, and as the term stuck, the seemingly artificial movement surrounding it began to rapidly develop into a critical and increasingly independent <b>film</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dogme {{language}} teaching {{is considered to}} be both a methodology and a movement. Dogme is a communicative approach to {{language teaching}} and encourages teaching without published textbooks and instead focusing on conversational communication among the learners and the teacher. It has its roots in an article by the language education author, Scott Thornbury. The Dogme approach is also referred to as “Dogme ELT”, which reflects its origins in the ELT (English language teaching) sector. Although Dogme language teaching gained its name from an analogy with the Dogme 95 <b>film</b> <b>movement</b> (initiated by Lars von Trier), the connection is not considered close.|$|E
50|$|Goring {{has been}} {{associated}} with different <b>film</b> <b>movements</b> including the London Film-Makers' Co-op and the Cinema of Transgression although he was often considered an outsider due to his political views differing from the often left-leaning mainstay.|$|R

25|$|In {{the burgeoning}} {{independent}} <b>film</b> <b>movement,</b> many short films are being produced and featured in festivals. Graceland, a film by Anocha Suwichakornpong, about an Elvis impersonator, {{was featured in}} the Cinéfondation competition at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. It was the first Thai short film selected at Cannes. Short-film festivals in Thailand include the Thai Short Film and Video Festival by the Thai Film Foundation and the Fat Film Festival by Fat Radio. Thai short-film programs are also put together for the Bangkok International Film Festival and the World Film Festival of Bangkok. {{for the past two}} years CNXWOOD Studios has co-sponsor a Film Festival, in the northern city of Chiang Mai in conjunction with Creative Kingdom Animation Studios Film.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} began to sponsor films in 1975, creating the National Film Development Corporation in 1981. Through this the government offers loans to filmmaker's {{who want to}} develop films, however the criteria for obtaining funds has been criticised as promoting only commercial films. Due to this lack of government funding for smaller projects, a strong independent <b>film</b> <b>movement</b> has developed. There has been a large increase in short films, which {{in the past two}} decades have begun to gain status in international film festivals. Independent documentaries often cover areas which would normally be censored by the government, such as sex and sexuality, as well as racial inequality and tension. Although the government has criticised some films for not showing multiculturalism, its actions have been inconsistent in that respect, and often favour the Malay culture over others.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the growing {{practice}} of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, {{with the goal}} of building a cult film audience, made the midnight movie a significant new mode of cinematic exhibition, with transgressive connotations. Socializing in a countercultural milieu was part of the original attraction of the midnight filmgoing experience, something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new midnight movie circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of the Living Dead.

500|$|After Indiscreet Donen made Britain {{his home}} {{until the early}} 1970s. Musicals' waning {{popularity}} caused Donen to focus on comedy films. He observed that his [...] "London base afforded me {{the advantage of being}} away from the Hollywood rat race.

I also had the advantage of the European influence: their way of looking at life, of making movies." [...] While in the UK in the early 1960s Donen was praised as an early influence on the then-emerging British New Wave <b>film</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{campaign}} arose as {{a reaction}} to the occupation, military actions and mercenaries by the Russian Federation against Ukraine in 2014. The dominance of Russian TV on the Ukrainian television, as well as the anti-Ukrainian sentiment and anti-Ukrainian propaganda, the praising of Russian security forces and secret police, all led to the boycott of the Russian TV and <b>films</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{effect is}} {{particularly}} pronounced in motion picture cameras. These cameras {{are subject to}} the constant motion of film being dragged through the film gate, so most motion picture cameras have <b>film</b> <b>movements</b> made or plated with wear-resistant alloys such as hard chrome. Given such a relatively reflective pressure plate behind the film, many motion picture films use an anti-halation (and anti-static) backing.|$|R

500|$|Upon its release, Loves of a Blonde was {{a popular}} success in its home country and was shown at some major film festivals, where it was well-received, garnering a number of {{nominations}} and awards. [...] Critical response was largely positive, although some reviewers were less enthusiastic than others. The film is now {{considered one of the}} most significant examples of a <b>film</b> <b>movement</b> called the Czech New Wave, which took advantage of a temporary relaxation of totalitarian control over creative artists to use cinema as a means to explore new narrative strategies while making pointed critiques of social and political conditions behind the Iron Curtain. It was nominated in 1966 for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
500|$|Though the {{government}} had accused earlier films of obscenity, Black Snow became the first film after World War II to be prosecuted by {{the government}} on obscenity charges. All copies of the film were confiscated from Nikkatsu and from Takechi's own home, and Takechi was arrested. The controversy gained international attention with The New York Times reporting that even the two censors who had passed the film were considered for prosecution, and that {{the government had}} announced plans to strictly censor the pink <b>film</b> <b>movement.</b> Japan's intellectual and artistic community came to Takechi's defense. Film directors Nagisa Oshima and Seijun Suzuki and authors Yukio Mishima and Kōbō Abe testified in Takechi's defense at the trial. Takechi took advantage of every opportunity to publicly speak out against censorship, and one Eirin official later admitted to being [...] "terrified by the man.".|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time as {{exhibition}} venues for B films vanished, the independent <b>film</b> <b>movement</b> was burgeoning; among the results were various crossovers between the low-budget genre movie and the [...] "sophisticated" [...] arthouse picture. Director Abel Ferrara, who built a reputation with violent B movies such as The Driller Killer (1979) and Ms. 45 (1981), made two works in the early nineties that marry exploitation-worthy depictions of sex, drugs, and general sleaze to complex examinations of honor and redemption: King of New York (1990) was backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of Bad Lieutenant (1992), , was financed totally independently. Larry Fessenden's micro-budget monster movies, such as No Telling (1991) and Habit (1997), reframe classic genre subjects—Frankenstein and vampirism, respectively—to explore issues of contemporary relevance. The budget of David Cronenberg's Crash (1996), , was not comfortably A-grade, but it was hardly B-level either. The film's imagery was another matter: [...] "On its scandalizing surface, David Cronenberg's Crash suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick", wrote critic Janet Maslin. Financed, like King of New York, by a consortium of production companies, it was picked up for U.S. distribution by Fine Line Features. This result mirrored the film's scrambling of definitions: Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line, recently merged into the Time Warner empire—specifically, it was the old exploitation distributor's arthouse division. Pulp Fiction (1994), directed by Quentin Tarantino on a [...] budget, became a hugely influential hit by crossing multiple lines, as James Mottram describes: [...] "With its art house narrative structure, B-movie subject matter and Hollywood cast, the film is the axis for three distinct cinematic traditions to intersect." ...|$|E
500|$|Only {{sporadic}} {{work was}} done on the Kinetoscope for much of 1890 as Dickson concentrated on Edison's unsuccessful venture into ore milling—between May and November, no expenses at all were billed to the lab's Kinetoscope account. By early 1891, however, Dickson, his new chief assistant, William Heise, and another lab employee, Charles Kayser, had succeeded in devising a functional strip-based film viewing system. In the new design, whose mechanics were housed in a wooden cabinet, a loop of horizontally configured 19mm (3/4inch) film ran around a series of spindles. The film, with a single row of perforations engaged by an electrically powered sprocket wheel, was drawn continuously beneath a magnifying lens. An electric lamp shone up from beneath the film, casting its circular-format images onto the lens and thence through a peephole atop the cabinet. As described by Robinson, a rapidly spinning shutter [...] "permitted {{a flash of light}} so brief that [...] frame appeared to be frozen. This rapid series of apparently still frames appeared, thanks to the persistence of vision phenomenon, as a moving image." [...] The lab also developed a motor-powered camera, the Kinetograph, capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go <b>film</b> <b>movement</b> that would be the foundation for the next century of cinematography.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in 16mm by first-time American {{director}} Barbara Loden won {{the international}} critics' prize at the Venice Film Festival. Wanda {{is both a}} seminal event in the independent <b>film</b> <b>movement</b> and a classic B picture. The crime-based plot and often seedy settings would have suited a straightforward exploitation film or an old-school B noir. The $115,000 production, for which Loden spent six years raising money, was praised by Vincent Canby for [...] "the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and... purity of technique." [...] Like Romero and Van Peebles, other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary. The first three features directed by Larry Cohen, Bone (1972), Black Caesar (1973), and Hell Up in Harlem (1973), were all nominally blaxploitation movies, but Cohen used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism. The gory horror film Deathdream (1974), directed by Bob Clark, is also an agonized protest {{of the war in}} Vietnam. Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential: Shivers (1975), Rabid (1977), The Brood (1979). An Easy Rider with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists' biker-themed Electra Glide in Blue (1973), directed by James William Guercio. The New York Times reviewer thought little of it: [...] "Under different intentions, it might have made a decent grade-C Roger Corman bike movie—though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio." ...|$|E
