5|$|As {{described}} above, John Scannella {{had argued}} in 2010 that Nedoceratops {{should be considered}} a synonym of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained that <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> valid distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops and made a further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise a synonym. The fossils, he argued, are indistinguishable from the T. horridus specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E

5|$|A recent {{economics}} {{report says}} that the music industry in Italy made €2.3 billion in 2004. That sum refers to the sale of CDs, music electronics, musical instruments, and ticket sales for live performances; <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> 4.35% growth over 2004. The actual sale of music albums has decreased slightly, {{but there has been}} a compensatory increase in paid-for digitally downloaded music from industry-approved sites. By way of comparison, the Italian recording industry ranks eighth in the world; Italians own 0.7 music albums per capita as opposed to the USA, in first-place with 2.7. The report cites a 20% increase in 2004 over 2003 in paid royalties for on-air as well as live music.|$|E

5|$|Although The Raft of the Medusa retains {{elements}} of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> break from the calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's death {{at the age of}} 32.

5|$|Jeff Tolbert also {{accepts the}} Slender Man as folkloric and {{suggests}} <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics {{is the process}} of acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).|$|E
5|$|Maya art is {{essentially}} {{the art of the}} royal court. It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world. Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non-perishable materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors. Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created, <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas. Maya art has many regional styles, and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text. The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.|$|E

5|$|An {{essential}} element for the band’s image is the Slipknot logo. The nonagram {{was created by}} the band’s members around the same time the band was founded. The nonagram is arguably the best-known sigil of Slipknot and <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> 9 point star – a symbol of unity, loyalty, friendship and remembrance. The logo is composed of three equilateral triangles each rotated at 0, 40, and 80 degrees. Each star point was meant to stand for each of the nine members of the original band. Despite popular belief, the nonagram is not a Satanist symbol, nor does it reflect something perverted, evil, unclean or sadistic. On the contrary, just as the band has officially declared on various occasions, the nonagram marks the unbreakable bond between its members. Chris Fehn is one of the band’s members who has a nonagram tattoo.|$|E
5|$|As of {{that time}} and in the {{following}} decades, Western Pomerania, plus some of Greater Poland, Lower Silesia and some areas west of the middle and lower Oder River made up the Sukow-Dziedzice culture group. Its origin {{is the subject of}} debate among archeologists. First settlements appear in the early 6th century and cannot be directly derived from any other Slavic archeological culture. They reveal certain similarities to the artifacts of the Dobrodzień group of the Przeworsk culture. According to scholars such as Siedow, Kurnatowska and Brzostowicz, it might be a direct continuation of the Przeworsk tradition. According to allochthonists, <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> variant of the Prague culture and is considered its younger stage. The Sukow-Dziedzice group shows significant idiosyncrasies, such as no graves and (typical {{for the rest of the}} Slavic world) rectangular dwellings set partially below the ground level were found within its span.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, an overdensity {{of stars}} in the region was {{announced}} to be the Canis Major Dwarf, the closest satellite galaxy to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact {{a variation in the}} thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables—consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy. On the other hand, a globular cluster in Puppis, NGC 2298—which appears {{to be part of the}} Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way's thick disk, and instead is of extragalactic origin.|$|E

5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} version {{of that kind of}} dance, the Chareos dance. <b>It</b> <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.|$|E
5|$|The production-possibility {{frontier}} can {{be constructed}} from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin) {{is the most common}} form of PPF. <b>It</b> <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point B to point D), the opportunity cost of producing that product increases, because we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it. With increasing production of butter, workers from the gun industry will move to it. At first, the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small. However, the cost of producing successive units of butter will increase as resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry.|$|E
