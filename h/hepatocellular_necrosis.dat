Although most patients achieve remission using the standard regimen, some patients do not respond due to either drug intolerance or refractory disease; in such cases alternative immunosuppressive agents should be explored.

30|$|Acetaminophen is {{ingested}} orally. The daily {{maximum dose}} is 4  g {{for an adult}} and 80  mg/kg for a child. After ingestion, the concentration peaks around 2  h. Dosages that induce toxic hepatitis are greater than 12  g per day in adults and 250  mg/kg over 24  h in children (Makin et al., 1995). After ingestion, around 90 % of the acetaminophen is metabolized to sulfate and glucuronide, which is conjugated in the liver and then excreted into the urine. Eight percent of the remaining acetaminophen is metabolized by cytochrome p 450 into the more toxic form of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI) when the glutathione (GSH) is depleted (Bessems and Vermeulen, 2001). NAPQI then binds to the cysteine group in the hepatocyte, and oxidative injury and <b>hepatocellular</b> centrilobular <b>necrosis</b> is then induced (Jollow et al., 1973). However, N-acetylcysteine limits the toxicity of acetaminophen by increasing the GSH stores, binding with NAPQI {{as a substitute for}} GSH, and enhancing sulfate conjugation (Lee, 2004).|$|R

40|$|Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) are {{essential}} {{in the defense}} against invading microorganisms, tissue trauma or any inciting inflammatory signals. Hepatic infiltration of neutrophils is an acute response to recent or ongoing liver injury, hepatic stress or unknown systemic inflammatory signals. Once neutrophils reach the liver, they can cause mild-to-severe tissue damage and consequent liver failure. For neutrophils {{to appear in the}} liver, neutrophils have to undergo systemic activation (priming) by inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, complement factors, immune complexes, opsonized particles and other biologically active molecules, e. g., platelet activating factor. Neutrophils accumulated in the hepatic microvasculature (sinusoids and postsinusoidal venules) can extravasate (transmigrate) into the hepatic parenchyma if they receive a signal from distressed cells. Transmigration can be mediated by a chemokine gradient established towards the hepatic parenchyma and generally involves orchestration by adhesion molecules on neutrophils (β 2 integrins) and on endothelial cells (intracellular adhesion molecules, ICAM- 1). After transmigration, neutrophils adhere to distressed hepatocytes through their β 2 integrins and ICAM- 1 expressed on hepatocytes. Neutrophil contact with hepatocytes mediate oxidative killing of hepatocytes by initiation of respiratory burst and neutrophil degranulation leading to <b>hepatocellular</b> oncotic <b>necrosis.</b> Neutrophil-mediated liver injury has been demonstrated in a variety of diseases and chemical/drug toxicities.

A total of 63 pathogen-free adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 9 groups and treated according to protocols. While no mortality was reported, animals treated with adjuvant HAART and AP recorded least% body weight gain. Significant derangements in serum lipid profiles were exacerbated by treatment of with AP as LDL (increased p <  0. 03), triglycerides (increased p <  0. 03) with no change in total cholesterol levels. Adjuvant AP with HAART caused reduction in LDL (p <  0. 05 and 0. 03), increased HDL (p <  0. 05) and TG (p <  0. 05 and 0. 001 for AP 100 and AP 200 doses respectively).

Partial depletion of circulating fibrinogen with ancrod did not impact ANIT hepatotoxicity. However, complete fibrin(ogen) deficiency significantly reduced serum alanine aminotransferase activity and <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>necrosis</b> in ANIT-treated mice. ANIT-induced <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>necrosis</b> was similar in PAR- 1 −/− mice compared with PAR- 1 +/+ mice.

Interestingly, a distinct lesion, parenchymal-type peliosis, was also observed in PAR- 4 −/− mice treated with ANIT and in mice that were given P 4 Pal- 10 prior to ANIT administration. The results suggest that fibrin(ogen), but not PAR- 1, contributes to the progression of ANIT hepatotoxicity in mice.

Their reported side effects include gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system effect and blood disorder. Rare side effects include phototoxicity, hypersensitivity, convulsion, psychosis, tendinitis, hypoglycemia, cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Some of these side effects have led to the withdrawal of some fluoroquinolones like travofloxacin from clinical use in some countries. Of recent fluoroquinolones induce cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity has gain attention. Due to increasing reports on fluoroquinolones associated hepatotoxicity in experimental Animal studies and clinical experience. This study reviews reported hepatotoxicity associated with clinically used fluoroquinolones and their safety profile on liver function. It was observed that some fluoroquinolones may have hepatotoxic potential. Reported fluoroquinolones induce hepatotoxicity manifested as hepatitis, pancreatis, jaundice, liver injury and hepatic failure. Most reported cases of fluoroquinolones induced hepatotoxicity were marked by elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, direct bilirubin, total bilirubin and prolong prothrobin time. In some reported cases liver biopsy revealed <b>hepatocellular</b> damage, <b>necrosis</b> and degeneration. Mixed inflammatory infiltrates containing eosinophils, portal edema, bile ductular proliferation and lobular cholestasis were also observed in some cases. The mechanism of fluoroquinolones induce hepatotoxicity may involve generation of oxidative radicals in the liver during drug metabolism which induces DNA damage, mitochondrial damage and gene regulation leading to hepatocellular damage. This was observed in travofloxacin which enhances hepatic mitochondrial peroxynitrite stress in mice with underlying increased basal levels of super oxide leading to the disruption of critical mitochondrial enzyme and gene regulation. This mechanism could be associated with fluoroquinolones mechanism of action which includes DNA damage. In conclusion fluoroquinolones are well tolerated but some may have hepatotoxic potential. Most clinically used fluoroquinolones are relatively safe but Clinicians should consider patients liver function status before fluoroquinolones clinical recommendation.

40|$|Extracellular matrix {{plays an}} {{important}} role in chronic hepatic lesions and has been studied in experimental intoxication models. However in cattle, studies on chronic disease have focused on the hepatocellular damage and extracellular matrix (ECM) changes are usually overlooked. There are no specific studies on the hepatic ECM in either normal or chronically damaged bovine liver. Thus an experimental model of hepatic toxicity model using Senecio brasiliensis poisoned calves was designed. Senecio brasiliensis contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids which cause either acute or chronic progressive dose dependent liver damage. Five calves were orally fed with 0. 38 g of dry leaves of S. brasiliensis/kg/day for 24 days. Liver needle biopsy specimens were obtained every 15 days for 60 days. Clinical signs of digestive complications appeared at 3 rd week. One calf died on 45 th day and four were evaluated up to 60 th day. Biopsy samples were processed for routine light microscopy, immuno-histochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. From 30 th day on progressive liver damage characterized by <b>hepatocellular</b> ballooning, <b>necrosis,</b> apoptosis and megalocytosis, centrilobular, pericellular and portal fibrosis were seen by light microscopy. Quantitative and semi-quantitative measurements of hepatic ECM components were performed before and after the onset of lesions. Morphometric analysis of total collagen and elastic fiber system was conducted. Total collagen and I and III collagen types progressively increased in throughout the liver of affected calves. Changes in location, amount and disposition of the elastic fiber system were also observed. Then numbers of Kupffer cells were significantly increased at 30 th day and total numbers of sinusoidal cells were significantly increased at 45 th and 60 th days.
