40|$|Plasma {{levels of}} endothelial microparticles (EMPs) are markers of {{cardiovascular}} diseases {{and contribute to}} the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Laminar shear stress (SS) protects against plaque formation contrarily to oscillatory and low SS. We thus investigated whether different flow patterns (laminar, low or static) could affect EMP release. HUVECs were subjected to high and low SS (15, 1. 5 dynes /cm 2) or no SS (static) for 24 hours. EMPs were isolated from the culture medium and characterized by annexin V labeling using flow cytometry analysis. HUVECs exposed to <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> for 24 hours emitted 4 fold less AnnexinV+ EMPs compared to static (p< 0. 001) and 3 fold less compared to low SS (p< 0. 01) conditions. This flowdependent EMP shedding was associated with the presence of 1. 7 %± 0. 05, 3. 75 %± 0. 1, 0. 4 %± 0. 06 of TUNEL positive HUVECs in static, low and high conditions, respectively. Treatment of HUVECs with L-NAME (10 - 4 M) significantly increased EMPs in all conditions when compared to untreated cells. Similar EMPs increase was obtained when cells were treated with KT 5720, a PKA inhibitor (10 - 6 M) under low and high flow. We further characterized EMPs by determining their surface expression of ICAM- 1. ICAM- 1 expression on EMPs was significantly increased in low SS and inhibited by <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> when compared to static conditions. Adhesion assays with EMPs-stimulated HUVECs (24 hours) increased U 937 cells capacity to attach in low SS-EMPs exposed to HUVECs compared to static and <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> EMPs stimulations. This effect was abolished with LFA-pretreated U 937 before adhesion suggesting the pro-adhesive properties of low SS-EMPs bearing ICAM- 1 at their surface. Altogether, these findings indicate that <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> decreased the thrombotic and adhesive properties of EMPs, which might in part explain their anti-atherogenic effects, whereas low SS induced the shedding of prothrombotic, ICAM- 1 positive EMPs, suggesting a novel way by which low SS might affect atherosclerosis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the historical development of}} blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) farming in Tracadie Bay (Prince Edward Island, Canada) and relates the spacing of suspended sleeves (SS) on longlines to seston uptake. From 1990 to 2001, mussel biomass in Tracadie Bay increased {{by a factor}} of four (from 1137 to 4743  t). By 2001, seston uptake rates were approximately three-fold water renewal rates, and harvest yields (kg sleeve− 1) were significantly lower than in the early 1990 s. A one-year field experiment was carried out to determine whether a change in SS could restore harvest yields. We found that SS (10, 20, 40, 60, 80  cm) had no significant effect on the condition index of mussels. However, <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> positively affected shell growth and abundance for small seeds that were densely packed within sleeves.

40|$|Summary: The ß 2 -microglobulin {{plasma level}} is often high in {{patients}} suffering from cirrhosis. Many authors believe {{this to be}} due to an increased production, provided that the creatinine level is in the normal ränge. In the present study, alterations in the plasma level and production of ß 2 -microglobulin were investigated in patients with liver cirrhosis without overt renal failure. 62 patients, 48 men and 14 women, suffering from liver cirrhosis were examined. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and plasma ß 2 -microglobulin were measured in all patients and in 16 controls. As ß 2 -microglobu-lin is freely filtered by glomeruli and its extrarenal catabolism is negligible, the ß 2 -microglobulin filtration rate was calculated äs the product of the ß 2 -microglobulin plasma level times the GFR. In steady state conditions, the ß 2 -microglobulin filtration rate may be used äs an indirect index of ß 2 -microglobulin production. The ß 2 -microglobulin plasma level was high in 26 patients; however, only 12 of them showed a definite rise in ß 2 -microglobulin production, äs shown by an increased ßi-microglobulin filtration rate. The 14 patients with <b>high</b> <b>ß</b> 2 -microglobulin plasma levels without <b>high</b> <b>ß</b> 2 -microglobulin filtration rates obviously showed a de-creased GFR; however, creatinine was not increased because of its small sensitivity äs an index of renal func-tion.

40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} assess {{relationship}} between the severity of coronary atherosclerosis assessed by SYNTAX score (SS) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI. Methods: After accounting for exclusion criteria, a total of 291 patient with STEMI in whom primary percutaneous coronary intervention was performed were retrospectively included (216 male, 75 female; mean age 61. 6 + 14. 0 years). Total and differential leukocyte counts and other biochemical markers were measured at admission. Patients were categorized into tertiles {{on the basis of}} SS. Monitoring for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) was performed during the in hospital follow-up period. Results: The SS high group leukocyte (p= 0. 009), neutrophil (p= 0. 008), NLR (p= 0. 048), peak troponin (p< 0. 001), peak CK-MB (p= 0. 001) lactate dehydrogenase (p= 0. 005), aspartate aminotransferase (p= 0. 004) values were significantly higher compared with SSlow and SSmid groups. SS was increased, left ventricular ejection fraction was decrease (p< 0. 001) and left ventricular systolic diameter was increased (p= 0. 007). The in-hospital death rate and MACEs were greater in the <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> group than in the other groups (p< 0. 001 both of). Conclusion: We found that high NLR was significantly and correlated increased with SS. In addition, <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> were significantly associated with increased in-hospital MACE and in-hospital death. Further prospective studies assessing the predictive role of both SS and NLR in conjunction for risk stratification might improve risk prediction in patients with STEMI.

40|$|Objective. To {{retrospectively}} {{analyze the}} clinical course {{of patients with}} mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) -type lymphoma of the parotid gland and associated Sjogren's syndrome (SS). Methods. All consecutive patients with SS and MALT lymphoma (MALT-SS) diagnosed in the University Medical Center Groningen between January 1997 and January 2009 were analyzed. Clinical course and treatment outcome of SS and MALT lymphoma were evaluated. Results. From a total of 329 patients with SS, 35 MALT-SS patients were identified, with a median followup of 76 months (range 16 - 153 mo). MALT lymphoma was localized in the parotid gland in all cases. Treatment consisted of "watchful waiting" (n = 10), surgery (n = 3), radiotherapy (n = 1), surgery combined with radiotherapy (n = 2), rituximab only (n = 13), or rituximab combined with chemotherapy (n = 6). Complete response was observed in 14 patients, partial response in 1 patient, and stable disease in 20 patients. In 6 of 7 patients with initially <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> disease activity (M-protein, cryoglobulins, IgM rheumatoid factor > 100 KIU/I, severe extraglandular manifestations), MALT lymphoma progressed and/or SS disease activity increased after a median followup of 39 months (range 4 - 98 mo), necessitating retreatment. Only 1 patient with MALT who had low SS disease activity showed progression of lymphoma when left untreated. Conclusion. An initially <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> disease activity likely constitutes an adverse prognostic factor for progression of lymphoma and/or SS. Such patients may require treatment for both MALT lymphoma and SS. In SS patients with localized asymptomatic MALT lymphoma and low SS disease activity, a "watchful waiting" strategy seems justified.
