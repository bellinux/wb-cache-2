5|$|In Japan, the two battleships of the 1903-4 Programme {{were the}} first to be laid down as all-big-gun designs, with eight 12-inch guns. However, the design had armor which was {{considered}} too thin, <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> substantial redesign. The financial pressures of the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns which had to be imported from Britain meant these ships were completed with a mixed 10- and 12-inch armament. The 1903-4 design also retained traditional triple-expansion steam engines.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2005, North Korea and South Korea held {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} possibility of sending a united team to the 2008 Olympics. The proposal failed, because of disagreements about how athletes would be chosen; North Korea was <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> certain percentage representation for its athletes. A subsequent attempt to broker an agreement for the two nations to walk together during the March of Nations failed as well, despite their having done so during the 2000 and 2004 Games.|$|E

5|$|A {{complication}} arose when Venancio Sanchez of St. Augustine {{purchased for}} US$400 a half {{share in the}} old Fornells grant from another surviving heir, who lived in Havana. A feud quickly developed between Sanchez and the Davises, with Sanchez <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> division of the property, and the Davises refusing to acknowledge that Sanchez had any claim to the island. The Davises had hoped that a restored lighthouse would be the centerpiece of their town, but all attempts to repair the lighthouse failed while the war was on. Shortly {{after the end of}} the war, the Davises gave up on Key Biscayne and moved to Texas. Their older son Edmund J. Davis eventually was elected as governor there.|$|E
5|$|According to Graham Spinardi in {{his book}} From Polaris to Trident (1994), STRAT-X was a {{response}} by the U.S. Department of Defense's Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering, Lloyd Wilson, to the U.S. Air Force; the service was <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> large ICBM called the WS-120A. Spinardi suggests that STRAT-X was allowed to proceed so it could terminate the study for such a missile. Funding for the WS-120A would not be released by Secretary McNamara, and plans for such a missile were canceled in 1967.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers {{acquired}} Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVP's by that time. Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> trade to either New York or Los Angeles. He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played. The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.|$|E

5|$|Although the Giants {{had one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} seasons in franchise history in 1990, the season had a difficult beginning as Taylor held out of training camp, <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> new contract with a salary of $2 million per year. Talks reached September with no progress. As the season approached Taylor received $2,500 dollars a day in fines for not reporting. Taylor signed a contract just four days before the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite barely practicing since the previous season, he started and finished with three sacks and a forced fumble.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of public and alumni demand for a {{basketball}} team, Michigan fielded a team {{of members of the}} then-current student body and achieved a 1–4 record for the 1908–09 season. However, after three years of <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> basketball program, the student body did not attend the games and the program was terminated due to low attendance. Basketball returned in 1917 in what was considered the inaugural season of varsity basketball. The team was coached by Elmer Mitchell who instituted the intramural sports program at Michigan. The team finished 6–12 overall (0–10, Big Ten). The following year Mitchell led the team to a 16–8 (5–5) record.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, Jinnah {{had come}} to believe that Muslims of the Indian subcontinent should have their own state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> {{separate}} nation. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula for the subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading all parties to agree to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|During 1942, Allied {{officials}} debated on {{the appropriate}} grand strategy to pursue. All agreed that defeating Germany {{was the primary}} objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France. The Soviets were also <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself {{would be subject to}} a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies. Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Yugoslav {{president}} Josip Broz Tito in 1980, the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated, with national tension fanned by the 1986 Serbian SANU Memorandum and the 1989 coups in Vojvodina, Kosovo and Montenegro. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> looser federation. In the same year, the first multi-party elections were held in Croatia, with Franjo Tuđman's win raising nationalist tensions further. Some of Serbs in Croatia left Sabor and declared the autonomy of areas that would soon become the unrecognised Republic of Serbian Krajina, intent on achieving independence from Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Gough Whitlam {{saw that}} the party had little chance of being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the {{traditional}} working-class base to include the suburban middle class. He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, and hoped that even rank-and-file party members could be given {{a voice in the}} conference. In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian Harradine, a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist. Whitlam resigned the leadership, <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> vote of confidence from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.|$|E

This busy schedule, <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> commute between three cities, proved {{to be too much}} for him and he dropped out of the Littauer Center. In late 1951, he resigned from his positions and went to Europe for nine months, seeking political inspiration. In Yugoslavia, he met Milovan Djilas, who impressed him greatly.|$|E
5|$|Lapensée was {{reputed to}} have scored over 150 goals {{and led her}} team to be unbeaten {{throughout}} 1916 and 1917, when records indicate that they won 45 of their 46 games. However, after <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> share of the profits from the games, Lapensée disappeared from the sport in 1918, still aged under 20. There {{were a number of}} rumours: that she had died in the 1918 flu pandemic, that she had travelled to New York to undergo a sex-change, or that she had always been a draft dodging man, though none provided any credible evidence. A 1940 profile of her father refuted all those claims, detailing her as living as a woman in New York.|$|E
5|$|Live {{performances}} {{before an}} audience constitute a major form of entertainment, especially before the invention of audio and video recording. Performance takes {{a wide range of}} forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European royal courts presented masques that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and like the masque, production expertise as well.|$|E

5|$|Mill {{workers in}} England became {{increasingly}} disenchanted with improper practices by factory owners, long working hours and unsatisfactory conditions. During the early 1850s workers {{throughout the country}} began to campaign for higher wages and strikes were held in several towns and cities; brickmakers in Manchester struck in January while woollen mill operatives in the West Riding of Yorkshire went on strike two months later.

5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil embargo against the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Because the United States imported approximately 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources, the embargo had a major effect. The price of gasoline shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered. Most Americans began <b>demanding</b> <b>a</b> solution to the problem, and President Richard Nixon began lobbying for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline as at least {{a part of the}} answer.|$|E
5|$|Shakur {{was indicted}} on May 30, 1974, on {{the charge of}} having robbed a Brooklyn bar and {{kidnapping}} bartender James E. Freeman for ransom.
