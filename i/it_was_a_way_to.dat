After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English, Uematsu played the {{keyboard}} in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials. When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a Square employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on.

25|$|In June 2003, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) {{banned the}} Ba'ath party. The {{additional}} step the CPA took—banning {{all members of}} the top four tiers of the Ba'ath Party from the new government, public schools and colleges—was criticized for blocking too many experienced people from participation in the new government. Thousands were removed from their positions, including doctors, professors, schoolteachers and bureaucrats. Many teachers lost their jobs, sparking protests at schools and universities. Under previous Ba'ath-party rule, one could not reach a high position in the government or a school without becoming a party member; party membership was a prerequisite for university admission. While many Ba'athists joined for ideological reasons, many more were members because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> better their options. Following pressure by the US, the policy of de-Ba'athification was addressed by the Iraqi government in January 2008 with its controversial Accountability and Justice Act. This purported to ease the policy, but many feared it would lead to further dismissals. The Ba'ath Party is led by Saddam's former deputy, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{a reality}} series {{originated}} when Doherty and Iswarienko were interested in documenting {{the weeks leading up}} to their wedding in a filming and production style similar to [...] and Deadliest Catch. Doherty had previously worked on reality television when she hosted Scare Tactics and Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty and participated on the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars. She called the project her agreement with Iswarienko to [...] "chronicle this time in our lives and let future brides and future grooms know that [...] not just you and that goes through the stress". According to Doherty, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> celebrate her third marriage: [...] "Can you bring all of those qualities to reality TV? Can you be that brutally honest, that completely raw, but with the quality of those two shows where you do use different cameras and you do want it to look spectacular?" [...] Doherty planned to develop the idea with her own production company, originally partnering with an unidentified television network. However, the series was picked up by WE tv when Doherty thought that the previous network was making the material too sensational. Miller said that he approved the series after seeing its pitch, and he found Doherty an appealing person to watch on reality television.|$|E

2500|$|The {{physical}} {{aspects of}} Lena and Bianca's romance were heavily downplayed by the series. When {{asked if she}} thought she and Riegel had succeeded in living up to the [...] "couple's groundbreaking and progressive" [...] reputation, Sosnovska responded, [...] "Yes, we succeeded to a certain extent. We succeeded in making this couple acceptable." [...] After a pause, Sosnovska continued, [...] "Not acceptable in a realistic sense, since our relationship hasn’t been portrayed truly realistically, {{which would have been}} nice." [...] She described Bianca and Lena's physical relationship as [...] "kind of ostentatiously reserved" [...] compared to what gets shown between heterosexual couples, [...] "although I’m quite shocked by what does get shown between the heterosexual couples." [...] Even though the couple had recently started [...] "dating" [...] again, as the writers also scripted a love triangle including Maggie, there was an apparent double-standard regarding intimacy between the same sex lovers; in the entire year of Lena and Bianca's on-again, off-again relationship, the two women had only kissed twice onscreen. The final obstacles given to the couple's onscreen intimacy were Bianca's rape by Michael and pregnancy with his child, which were controversial and seen by viewers as desperate attempts by the network to avoid lesbian love scenes. AfterEllen.com editor Sarah Warn stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> assure Bianca's continued asexuality. Warn added that [...] "the pregnant-lesbian storyline" [...] is a favorite refuge for television writers who both want to avoid dealing with the sexual aspects of lesbian relationships and who want to [...] "normalize" [...] the lesbian characters — [...] "to show viewers that, at their core, lesbians are just like heterosexual women — who of course, all want to be mothers". In 2004, though Lena and Bianca were allowed to kiss for a third time onscreen, it came {{at the end of their}} romance, as Lena went back to Poland to tend to her ailing mother and the couple was later written to have broken up over the phone.|$|E
60|$|That {{seemed at}} the end of ten days the upshot of the abundant, the {{recurrent}} talk through which Strether poured into him all it concerned him to know, put him in full possession of facts and figures. Never cutting these colloquies short by a minute, Chad behaved, looked and spoke as if he were rather heavily, perhaps even a trifle gloomily, but none the less fundamentally and comfortably free. He made no crude profession of eagerness to yield, but he asked the most intelligent questions, probed, at moments, abruptly, even deeper than his friend's layer of information, justified by these touches the native estimate of his latent stuff, and had in every way the air of trying to live, reflectively, into the square bright picture. He walked up and down in front of this production, sociably took Strether's arm at the points at which he stopped, surveyed it repeatedly from the right and from the left, inclined a critical head to either quarter, and, while he puffed a still more critical cigarette, animadverted to his companion on this passage and that. Strether sought relief--there were hours when he required it--in repeating himself; it was in truth not to be blinked that Chad had a way. The main question as yet was of what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>TO.</b> It made vulgar questions no more easy; but that was unimportant when all questions save those of his own asking had dropped. That he was free was answer enough, and it wasn't quite ridiculous that this freedom should end by presenting itself as what was difficult to move. His changed state, his lovely home, his beautiful things, his easy talk, his very appetite for Strether, insatiable and, when all was said, flattering--what were such marked matters all but the notes of his freedom? He had the effect of making a sacrifice of it just in these handsome forms to his visitor; which was mainly the reason the visitor was privately, for the time, a little out of countenance. Strether was at this period again and again thrown back on a felt need to remodel somehow his plan. He fairly caught himself shooting rueful glances, shy looks of pursuit, toward the embodied influence, the definite adversary, who had by a stroke of her own failed him and on a fond theory of whose palpable presence he had, under Mrs. Newsome's inspiration, altogether proceeded. He had once or twice, in secret, literally expressed the irritated wish that SHE would come out and find her.|$|E
