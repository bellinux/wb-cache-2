40|$|International audienceThe Dur At Talah {{sequence}} outcrops in the Abu Tumayam Trough, in {{the southern}} part of the Sirt Basin (Libya). This formation consists of two units, the New Idam Unit at the base and the Sarir Unit at the top. This stratigraphic succession highlights a regressive trend attributed to the upper Eocene. Sedimentological investigations based on lithofacies and ichnofacies suggest that the depositional environments were mainly dominated by a tidal dynamic in the New Idam Unit. Several palaeoenvironments have been defined in this unit: The basal part is built up of an intertidal to supratidal flat system associated with oyster patches. The medium part is characterized by an estuarine channels belt. The upper part exposes typical facies of tidal delta plain and a prograding bar system (mouth-bars). The extremely good preservation of sedimentary structures and sequences allows investigation of the recording of tidal cycles at various scales of time, from the elementary tidal cycle to the solstitial cycle. A comparison with modern Mont-Saint-Michel Bay (France) deposits is proposed to validate facies and palaeoenvironment interpretations in the New Idam Unit. Tidal overprint in the New Idam Unit is expressed through tidal rhythmites composed of horizontal laminations, ripples (flaser, wavy or lenticular) as well as climbing ripples. The elementary recording is made of a mud-sand couplet corresponding to one tide event (slack and flood/ebb). The next scale of recording corresponds to the semi-lunar neap-spring cycle (fortnightly) up to, occasionally, the lunar cycle. Finally, a higher wavelength cycle is recognized corresponding to semi-annual cyclicity. All these cycles are identified in large-scale sedimentary bodies attributed to tidal channels and are best expressed within IHS. The superimposition of the different tidal cycles controls the heterolithic nature of the channel infill. In addition, the tidal rhythmites constitute an accurate chronometer to estimate the duration of tidal channel migration and infilling. This estimation is possible due to the very good preservation of the rhythmites and because of the scarcity of <b>internal</b> <b>erosions</b> within the channel infill...|$|R
2500|$|Rock-fill dams are {{embankments}} of compacted free-draining granular {{earth with}} an impervious zone. The earth utilized often contains {{a high percentage}} of large particles, hence the term [...] "rock-fill". The impervious zone may be on the upstream face and made of masonry, concrete, plastic membrane, steel sheet piles, timber or other material. The impervious zone may also be within the embankment in which case it is referred to as a core. In the instances where clay is utilized as the impervious material the dam is referred to as a composite dam. To prevent <b>internal</b> <b>erosion</b> of clay into the rock fill due to seepage forces, the core is separated using a filter. Filters are specifically graded soil designed to prevent the migration of fine grain soil particles. When suitable material is at hand, transportation is minimized leading to cost savings during construction. Rock-fill dams are resistant to damage from earthquakes. However, inadequate quality control during construction can lead to poor compaction and sand in the embankment which can lead to liquefaction of the rock-fill during an earthquake. Liquefaction potential can be reduced by keeping susceptible material from being saturated, and by providing adequate compaction during construction. An example of a rock-fill dam is New Melones Dam in California or the Fierza Dam in Albania.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA coupled fluid-solid {{numerical}} {{method is}} presented. The solid phase {{consists of a}} granular assembly where dynamics of each solid particle is described with the discrete element method. In the inter-particle space the fluid flow is solved with the lattice Boltzmann method. Interactions between the solid phase and the fluid phase result from the integration, over the solid particle boundary, of the momentum exchange between solid and fluid phases. Consequently, assumptions about fluid-solid interactions are very limited with such a coupling. To illustrate abilities and limits of the coupled method {{in the framework of}} <b>internal</b> soil <b>erosion,</b> a two-dimensional model of piping erosion is considered (inspired from the hole erosion test). Direct simulations of erosion of a cohesive- frictional granular matter have been performed for different values of water pressure gradient and inter-particle cohesion. As classically found experimentally, the mass rate of erosion follows a relation of the kind of Shield's law, with a linear dependency on the hydraulic shear stress.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a theoretical model {{to capture the}} rate of erosion of a silty sand {{based on the principle}} of conservation of energy. Erosion is considered to begin when the interparticle bonds between grains are broken by hydrodynamic stresses exerted on the soil particles. These detached particles are then suspended and transported by the flow of eroding fluid. It is further assumed that once the particles are fully suspended and have reached the flow velocity, resettlement does not take place. Stabilization of soil particles because of lignosulfonate (LS) treatment is represented by the increased strain energy required to break the interparticle bonds. The equation proposed in this study is based on the shear stress-strain characteristics, mean flow velocity, mean particle diameter, and the packing arrangement of particles. The result of the proposed study is presented in the form of erosion rate versus the hydraulic shear stress. The model is validated with a series of laboratory erosion tests using the Process Simulation Apparatus for <b>Internal</b> Crack <b>Erosion</b> (PSAICE) for different percentages of LS.

40|$|Research to {{the failure}} {{mechanism}} piping (<b>internal,</b> backward <b>erosion)</b> in the Netherlands shows that the dikes require costly berms to meet the required safety standards. According to the Sellmeijer piping-formula, the d 70 (70 %-quantile of the grain size distribution by weight) is an important parameter in the resistance against piping. Therefore a better insight in the d 70 variability in the naturally deposited sand layers beneath dikes is of great importance. High density site measurements (5 x 5 meter spacing) give insight in local heterogeneity of the d 70 and the implications for representative design values. Three test sites were developed at locations with distinct geomorphological deposits. The spatial variability in the d 70 appears to be large. Despite {{the large amount of}} data at a very dense measurement grid, there is no obvious spatial correlation in the measurements. The sites have a similar or larger coefficient of variation than the much sparser regional datasets that are normally used to derive the representative d 70. Current regulations prescribe the characteristic (5 % lower bound) value as the design parameter in the piping formula. Considering the large variation in d 70 values this approach may not be appropriate. Given the influence of the d 70 on dike dimensions, hence investment costs, establishing a method for determining a representative d 70 value is important. We recommend to develop more sites at distinct geomorphological deposits to gain insight in the spatial variability in grain size distribution and to determine design values with matching site sampling requirements. An important aspect of further research is the interaction between d 70 variability and the physical development of the piping channel...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{waves are}} waves that {{propagate}} along the pycnocline, {{the interface between}} two density-stratified fluids. Even though internal waves are ubiquitous in oceans and lakes, their impact in the sedimentary record has remained largely unrecognized. Internal waves can remobilize the sediment from the depth at which the internal waves break onto the sea floor. In shelf, or ramp settings, internal wave deposits (internalites) have to be distinguished from tempestites while in slope and deeper settings internalites require distinction from turbidites. The Upper Kimmeridgian carbonate ramp succession cropping out near Ricla (NE Spain) provides some key evidence to differentiate the depositional processes induced by breaking internal waves from those related to surface storm waves. Sandy-oolitic grainstone eventites, previously interpreted as tempestites, contain evidence of reworking by turbulent events related to breaking internal waves. Underlying rationale are: 1) they occur in distal mid-ramp position, detached from the coeval shallow-water successions; 2) {{they do not have}} the characteristic coarsening- and thickening upward trend of storm deposits; 3) they gradually thin-out to disappear both up dip and down dip, interbedded with mid-ramp lime mudstones; and 4) they show little or no erosion towards the shallower areas. A facies model for internalites produced by two sediment populations, sand and mud, on a gently sloping carbonate ramp is proposed. The individual internalites occurring at Ricla include several architectural elements, sequentially organized in dip direction, which can be related to the flows associated with breaking <b>internal</b> waves: <b>erosion</b> in the breaker zone, swash run-up and tractive backwash flow. Individual internalites stack, with down- and up-slope shingling configuration, in dm-thick packages thought to reflect the up-slope and down-slope migration of the breaker zone, in turn related to depth variations of the palaeo-pycnocline. Packages occur in dm- to m-thick clusters suggested to reflect changes in sediment supply and/or variations in water stratification affecting the energy of internal waves...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: <b>Internal</b> soil <b>erosion</b> is a {{real threat}} for {{hydraulic}} infrastructures. In&# 13; its final stage it develops in piping involving the formation and progression of a continuous void&# 13; inside the soil between the upstream and downstream sides. The hole erosion test was introduced to&# 13; characterize kinematics of piping {{in terms of the}} time left to rupture. Actual modeling approaches of&# 13; this test are essentially one dimensional. The wall shear stress generated by the flow is assumed to be&# 13; uniform, so that erosion rate is also uniform along the hole length. Experimental observations show&# 13; however an irregular profile of the eroded hole. Approach: In this study an axisymmetric extension&# 13; representation of the hole erosion test was performed. The biphasic flow at the origin of surface&# 13; erosion occurring in the porous soil sample was modeled by means of the renormalization group&# 13; based k-&# 949; turbulence equations. Fluent software package was used to perform the numerical&# 13; modeling. Results: This had enabled to estimate the wall shear stress which was found to be non&# 13; uniform along the hole length. Erosion rate was then estimated by using a classical law. Its variations&# 13; as affected by the applied gradient pressure, fluid density as well as the actual fluid/soil interface&# 13; roughness were analyzed. In particular, wall roughness and clay concentration were found to&# 13; increase noticeably the erosion rate. Conclusion/Recommendations: Predicting erosion rate at the&# 13; start of piping formation can be done by the proposed model. Flow features are however very&# 13; complex in the real HET configuration. In particular, clay concentration does not vary equally along&# 13; the hole length.
