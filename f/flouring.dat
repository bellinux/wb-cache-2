Its most marked progress took place after the chief portion of the property was acquired by Henry Fowlds, Esq., and his sons, and their removal there in 1857. A new grist and <b>flouring</b> mill was added to the old one, a saw mill of great power and numerous saws, capable of manufacturing large quantities of lumber yearly for the foreign market, were speedily erected.|$|E

40|$|<b>Flour</b> from gadung tubers (Dioscorea hispida Dennst) and {{modified}} cassava <b>flour</b> or MOCAF are types of non-wheat <b>flour</b> that have high carbohydrate content {{that could potentially}} {{be used to make}} noodles. However, due to low protein content and therudimentary physicochemical properties, it needs to be done mixing with wheat <b>flour</b> to get noodles with goodquality.

25|$|The city, a {{timber and}} farming {{community}} southwest of Portland and northwest of Salem, was incorporated in 1880. Sheridan {{was named for}} General Philip Sheridan, who was posted to Yamhill County and Fort Yamhill {{in the latter half}} of the 1850s to monitor the Native Americans at what is now the Grand Ronde Reservation west of the city. By 1894, the city had grown to 400 residents, one bank, two hotels, three churches, and a <b>flouring</b> mill. At that time there was a daily train to the city as well as daily stage coach service from McMinnville, and a single wooden bridge over the river.|$|E
25|$|The year 1858 {{marked the}} {{completion}} of the flour mill and distillery that Walker was building in Canada and at this time business could begin. During which time he still maintained his very successful grain business in the United States. The flour that would be produced in his flour mill would prove to be that worthy of popularity in not only Canada but also the United States and Britain. His introduction of a large steam <b>flouring</b> mill benefited the County of Essex’s farming community, which at this time made up most of the population, by encouraging farming practices. Wheat farmers from all around would go and use the flour mill as it gained in popularity.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Scott died in 1886 {{and in time}} William became {{convinced}} that their mill might be better served another way. He canvassed many of his farmer friends and customers for miles around Caledonia persuading them to invest in shares of a new milling firm. There were successful examples in other milling establishments. And so on Feb 16, 1892 The Caledonia Milling Company Limited received its provincial charter and in March, 1892 a Bargain and Sale was recorded: “William Scot and wife and Hugh Scott and wife to The Caledonia Milling Co.

25|$|Beluga whale {{or white}} whale Delphinapterus leucas (cetuaq, assigarnaq, qecip'atuli in Yup'ik cituaq in Cup'ik, cetuar in Cup'ig) {{is used for}} human and dog food. Beluga {{harvested}} in spring are used primarily for human food, although some are used for dog food. Beluga harvests in the fall usually are lower than in spring. The late fall beluga hunts were used to produce food for the dogs. Parts of the beluga used for human food include the skin, fat, backstrap, and intestines. Backstrap meat is sometimes dried, and beluga skin is sometimes pickled. Beluga products are prepared a number of ways, such as boiling skin and meat (eaten hot or cold); <b>flouring</b> and frying or barbecuing backstraps; and processing fat into oil for use with dried fish and meat. Ways of preserving and using beluga products show local differences between communities and families.|$|E
25|$|Star {{was born}} in Bavaria, Germany, to Jewish parents. When he was ten years of age, {{his family moved to}} Ohio. When he grew older, he moved to Helena, Montana, where he served as {{territorial}} auditor and personal secretary to the governor. He partnered with Seth Bullock in a hardware store. In August 1876, Star and Bullock, attracted to Deadwood by the promise of a great deal of business stemming from the gold rush, purchased a lot there from Al Swearengen and Henry Beaman. They opened the Office of Star and Bullock, Auctioneers and Commission Merchants. They later partnered in livestock ranching as the S Ranch Company, and with Harris Franklin in the Deadwood <b>Flouring</b> Mill, in 1880, where Star was the general manager. The duo expanded their business interests to the towns of Spearfish, Sturgis, and Custer.|$|E

Settlers arrived in the Ashland area in January 1852, including Robert B. Hargadine, Sylvester Pease, Abel D Helman, Eber Emery, and others. Helman and Hargadine filed the first donation land claims in Ashland. Helman and Emery built a sawmill along what was then called Mill Creek to turn timber into lumber for settlers. In 1854, they and another settler, M. B. Morris, built a second mill, Ashland <b>Flouring</b> Mills, to grind local wheat into flour. The community around the mill became known as Ashland Mills. A post office was established in Ashland Mills in 1855 with Helman as postmaster.|$|E

500|$|Before the {{industrialization}} {{of chicken}} production, {{and the creation}} of broiler breeds of chicken, only young spring chickens (pullets or cockerels) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying, making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer. Older, tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures. To compensate for this, sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender, allowed to cool and dry, and then fried. (This method is common in Australia.) Another method is to fry the chicken pieces using a pan fried method. The chicken pieces are then simmered in liquid, usually, a gravy made in the pan that the chicken pieces were cooked in. This process (of <b>flouring,</b> frying and simmering in gravy) is known as [...] "smothering" [...] and can be used for other tough cuts of meat, such as swiss steak. Smothered chicken is still consumed today, though with the exception of people who raise their own chickens, or who seek out stewing hens, it is primarily made using commercial broiler chickens.|$|E

500|$|Another of Bradley's {{concerns}} in his {{message to the}} legislature was {{the condition of the}} Governor's Mansion. In his address, he declared [...] "As to the Executive Mansion, for years its floors have been propped up to prevent them from falling, and it required more than seven hundred feet of weather strips to make it comfortable in the winter. The present site is disagreeable, the view from one side overlooks the walls of the penitentiary, and from the other the smokestack of a large <b>flouring</b> mill nearby." [...] Instead of addressing Bradley's concerns, the General Assembly passed a [...] "ripper bill" [...] taking control of the mansion from the governor and putting it {{under the supervision of the}} Court of Appeals. On February 10, 1899, the mansion caught fire as a result of a faulty flue in the governor's bedroom. The day was so cold that the fireman had difficulty keeping the water in their hoses unfrozen, and the mansion suffered extensive damage. Though the mansion was insured and a reporter for the Courier-Journal opined that the sensible thing to do would be to demolish the old structure and construct a new one or purchase another house in Frankfort to serve as the governor's mansion, the legislature was disinclined to make more than minimal accommodations for a Republican governor. Consequently, the mansion was once again repaired. The Bradleys stayed with a neighbor in Frankfort immediately after the fire. Thereafter, Governor Bradley stayed in Frankfort's Capitol Hotel, while Mrs. Bradley and daughter Christine returned to the family's home in Lancaster. The family re-occupied the residence prior to the end of Bradley's term.|$|E
