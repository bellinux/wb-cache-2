5|$|Following the {{explosion}} aboard Mercure, Iéna {{and the other}} French brigs scattered, briefly pursued by Weasel, who chased Iéna and Mamelouck {{but was unable to}} bring them to a decisive action. The loss of the French escorts allowed Victorious to close with Rivoli unopposed and at 04:30 the two large ships began a close range artillery duel. This combat continued unabated for the next three and a half hours, both ships being severely damaged and suffering heavy casualties. Captain Talbot was struck on the head by a flying splinter and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> the deck, temporarily blinded, command passing to Lieutenant Thomas Peake. To assist in subduing Rivoli, Peake recalled Weasel to block the French ship's attempts to escape, Commander Andrew sailing his ship in front of Rivoli and repeatedly raking her.|$|E

5|$|Blackwell and {{her parents}} lived in Lula, until 1936 when she was three years old; Blackwell's father left the {{plantation}} on which he worked, and fled to Memphis, Tennessee, fearing for his life after he confronted his boss about speaking to his wife. Soon afterwards, Blackwell and her mother left the plantation to live with him. Blackwell's family traveled frequently in search of work. On June 20, 1938, Blackwell's parents separated due to religious differences. Blackwell and her mother went to West Helena, Arkansas, to live with Blackwell's great aunt so {{that she had the}} opportunity to receive an education. A quality education in Mississippi was not an option for Blackwell because the schools there were centered on the cultivation of crops and the plantation system. While living in West Helena, Blackwell often visited her father in Memphis. During the summer months she would leave West Helena and live with her grandfather and grandmother in Lula, where she helped plant and harvest cotton. Blackwell spent a majority of her early years chopping cotton in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee and peeling tomatoes in Florida. She was 14 when she finished the eighth grade, the final year of school at Westside, a school in West Helena for black children. Blackwell <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> school to earn for her family.|$|E

25|$|A mass {{emigration}} {{was politically}} undesirable for the Soviet regime. The only acceptable ground was family reunification, and a formal petition ("вызов", vyzov) from a relative from abroad {{was required for}} the processing to begin.

The risks to apply for an exit visa compounded because the entire family <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> their jobs, which in turn would make them vulnerable to charges of social parasitism, a criminal offense. Because of these hardships, Israel set up the group Lishkat Hakesher in the early 1950s to maintain contact and promote aliyah with Jews behind the Iron Curtain.|$|E

40|$|Background An {{understanding}} {{of the characteristics of}} smokers who <b>have</b> never tried <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> may be useful to help identify and target these individuals and encourage them to attempt to give up smoking. Using national survey data we investigated variables associated with smokers reporting never <b>having</b> tried <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Methods Using data from the 2007 and 2009 UK Office for National Statistics Opinions and Lifestyle Survey we identified all self-reported current smokers aged 16 +. The primary outcome was response to the question ‘have you ever tried <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking?’ Univariable and multivariable logistic regression quantified the association between this outcome and several potential explanatory variables, including age, sex, socioeconomic status, health status, smoking behaviour, and knowledge of the dangers of smoking. Results Desire <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> was the most significant independent predictor of whether a smoker reported never <b>having</b> tried <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Smokers who reported that their health was good or very good were more likely <b>to</b> report never <b>having</b> tried <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> than those whose health was fair, bad or very bad (OR 1. 59, 95...|$|R
