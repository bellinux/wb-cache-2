5|$|Like other Rust Belt cities, Utica had an {{economic}} downturn beginning in the mid-20thcentury. The downturn consisted of industrial decline due to globalization and the closure of textile mills, population loss caused by the relocation of jobs and businesses to suburbs and to Syracuse, and poverty associated with socioeconomic stress and a decreased tax base.

5|$|The <b>growth</b> <b>for</b> many towns {{was only}} temporary. Growth in some {{communities}} was often driven by exploitation of limited oil resources, so once wells ran dry or demand slowed, their populations rapidly declined. When Wortham's boom ended, the population crashed from its 1927 peak of 30,000 to 2,000 people in 1929. The population of Breckenridge dropped from a similar high to 7,569 in 1930.|$|E

5|$|By the 1840s, the {{boarding}} school {{had grown to}} 30 students. As the enrollment expanded, the Sibleys added new rooms to the cabin. The continued improvements created a financial strain on the school and Mary Sibley traveled to the East Coast to solicit additional funding. In the early 1850s, the school {{was on the brink}} of closing when the Sibleys offered the property to the Presbyterian Church. In 1853, the school was incorporated by special act of the Missouri Legislature and became known as the Lindenwood College for Women. The newly chartered college was placed under the control of 15 directors appointed by the Presbytery of St. Louis. On July 4, 1856, the cornerstone was laid for a new permanent brick building to replace the original log cabins. The new building, Sibley Hall, was completed in July 1857, and at the time contained the entire school. This event marked {{the beginning of a new}} era of significant <b>growth</b> <b>for</b> Lindenwood.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1906, most {{leaders from}} Azusa Street had spun off to form other congregations, such as the 51st Street Apostolic Faith Mission, the Spanish AFM, and the Italian Pentecostal Mission.

The Southeast United States was a particularly prolific area of <b>growth</b> <b>for</b> the movement, since Seymour's approach gave a useful explanation for a charismatic spiritual climate {{that had already been}} taking root in those areas. Other new missions were based on preachers who had charisma and energy. Nearly all of these new churches were founded among immigrants and the poor.|$|E

In addition, Colbourn was responsible for constructing the Central Florida Research Park, located adjacent to the UCF campus and founded in 1978. The park serves as {{a major focus of}} simulation for space and defense-related research. The park was one part of Colbourn's plan to make UCF a world-class partnership university. Among the university's first partners were Lockheed Martin and the United States Navy, and Colbourn led the push to found both the Institute for Simulation and Training and the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers in 1986. During his tenure, enrollment increased from 11,000 in 1978 to over 18,000 in 1989. However, Colbourn's most notable accomplishments as president were supporting the young university's athletic programs. He was responsible for establishing the school's football program in 1979, which began an era of <b>growth</b> <b>for</b> the university. In April 1979, UCF awarded its 15,000th degree.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Arlington's largest {{employers}} remained its shingle mills and saw mills.

The Great Depression of the 1930s forced {{all but one of the}} mills to close, causing unemployment to rise in Arlington and neighboring cities. The federal government established a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp near Darrington to create temporary jobs; the young men built structures and conducted firefighting in the Mount Baker National Forest. The Works Progress Administration and Civil Works Administration funded the construction of the city's sidewalks, a high school, and a municipal airport that opened in 1934.|$|E

Participants are usually taken from the poorest groups in society, and outsourcing increasingly means that trials may be conducted in countries with highly competitive wages by contract research organizations (CROs).

5|$|Roman {{city life}} and culture changed greatly {{in the early}} Middle Ages. Although Italian cities {{remained}} inhabited, they contracted significantly in size. Rome, for instance, shrank from a population {{of hundreds of thousands}} to around 30,000 {{by the end of the}} 6th century. Roman temples were converted into Christian churches and city walls remained in use. In Northern Europe, cities also shrank, while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials. The establishment of new kingdoms often meant some <b>growth</b> <b>for</b> the towns chosen as capitals. Although there had been Jewish communities in many Roman cities, the Jews suffered periods of persecution after the conversion of the empire to Christianity. Officially they were tolerated, if subject to conversion efforts, and at times were even encouraged to settle in new areas.|$|E
