5|$|On {{the second}} day of the battle, news reached the Allies that their lines of retreat were no longer threatened; they {{therefore}} resolved to maintain their position. They staged a <b>hit-and-run</b> <b>attack</b> on some Cilician ships, capturing and destroying them. On the third day, however, the Persian fleet attacked the Allies lines in full force. In a day of savage fighting, the Allies held on to their position, but suffered severe losses (half the Athenian fleet was damaged); nevertheless, the Allies inflicted equal losses on the Persian fleet. That evening, the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allies at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, they retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.|$|E
5|$|T.C. Russell is {{the patriarch}} of the Russell family. He is {{characterized}} by his violent temper and hatred of Julian Crane for supposedly injuring him in a <b>hit-and-run</b> <b>attack,</b> and destroying his chances of becoming a professional tennis player. T.C. is initially portrayed as a harsh and unforgiving parent; he pushes Whitney to train to be a tennis champion, as he once wanted to be, and disapproves of her relationship with Chad Harris-Crane, feeling it is a distraction. He is also violent with Simone when she reveals she is a lesbian. After learning about Eve's past relationship with Julian and her responsibility for the car crash that ended his tennis career, T. C. files for divorce and has a brief romance and engagement to her adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne. The show humanizes T.C. and softens his temper during his recovery from a stroke; his final storylines focus on his attempts to rebuild {{his relationship with his}} ex-wife and children. In 2007, he moves to New Orleans to help Whitney with her pregnancy and reconnect with Simone. T.C. does not appear in the show after its transition to DirecTV, and he is neither seen nor mentioned in the series finale.|$|E

25|$|On April 3 and 4, 1965, Risner led {{two large}} {{missions}} against the Thanh Hóa Bridge in North Vietnam. On {{the afternoon of}} April 3, the strike package of Rolling Thunder Mission 9 Alpha consisted of 79 aircraft, including 46 F-105s. 16 of those carried AGM-12 Bullpup missiles, while another 30 carried eight 750-pound bombs each, half of which were designated for the railroad and highway bridge. The force had clear conditions but encountered a severe glare in the target area that made the bridge difficult to acquire for attacks with the Bullpups. Only one Bullpup could be guided at a time, and on his second pass, Risner's aircraft took a hit just as the missile struck the bridge. Fighting a serious fuel leak and a smoke-filled cockpit in addition to anti-aircraft fire from the ground, he again nursed his crippled aircraft to Danang. The use of Bullpups against the bridge had been completely ineffectual, resulting in the scheduling of a second mission {{the next day with}} 48 F-105s attacking the bridge without destroying it. The missions saw the first interception of U.S. aircraft by North Vietnamese MiG-17 fighters, resulting in the loss of two F-105s and pilots of the last flight, struck by a <b>hit-and-run</b> <b>attack</b> while waiting for their run at the target.|$|E
500|$|In late 1962, Air Marshal Sir John Nicholls instigated a trial when he flew Spitfire PM631, a PR Mk 19 in {{the custody}} of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, against an English Electric Lightning F 3 (a {{supersonic}} jet-engined interceptor) in mock combat at RAF Binbrook. At the time British Commonwealth forces were involved in possible action against Indonesia over Malaya and Nicholls decided to develop tactics to fight the Indonesian Air Force P-51 Mustang, a fighter that had a similar performance to the PR Mk 19. The first airframe (PM631) developed mechanical issues which removed it from the trial. Another PR Mk 19, PS853, which is now owned by Rolls-Royce, was on gate-guard duties at Binbrook, having been retired from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) one year before. It had been maintained in running condition by ground crews at Binbrook, and after a short time was participating in the trials. At the end of the trials, RAF pilots found that Firestreak infra-red guided missiles had trouble acquiring the Spitfire due to a low exhaust temperature, and decided that the twin ADEN [...] cannons were the only weapons suited to the task, which was complicated by the tight turning circle of the Spitfire and the Lightning's proclivity for over-running the Spitfire. It was concluded that the most effective and safest way for a modern jet-engined fighter to attack a piston-engined fighter was to engage full afterburner at an altitude lower than the Spitfire, and behind it to perform a <b>hit-and-run</b> <b>attack,</b> contrary to all established fighter-on-fighter doctrine at that time.|$|E

50|$|Harrison {{descended the}} Maumee {{to the site}} of Fort Meigs with an army which {{ultimately}} numbered 4,000 men (mainly militia) and began construction of the fort on 1 February 1813.

He found the officer he had left in charge, Joel B. Leftwich, had left with all his men because the enlistment period of the militia units assigned to the task had expired. Construction had halted, and the wood that had been cut was being used as firewood.|$|E
