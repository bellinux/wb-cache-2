25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, {{one third}} of housing within Birmingham was <b>declared</b> <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>habitation</b> and a major {{construction}} programme was needed to deal with problem. By 1950, Birmingham City Council had been constructing municipal housing to accommodate the rising population of Birmingham and to accommodate {{those who had been}} displaced by the slum clearances in the inner-city areas of the city, similar to the process which had started some 30 years earlier when the first council houses were built. Municipal house construction developed into high-rise construction in the mid-1950s with the guidance of Alwyn Sheppard Fidler, the City Architect of Birmingham. By 1962, however, the city council was demolishing more houses than it was constructing and Fidler urged the council to adopt the French Camus system which consisted of housing at a density of approximately 50 houses per hectare and 80 people per acre. The council refused this and demanded 48 homes per hectare with 75 people per acre. In a final attempt to convince the council, he proposed a 'garden city' layout for the Castle Bromwich Airfield site in 1963. This too was rejected and, as a result, Fidler resigned from his position. He was quickly succeeded by J. R. Sheridan-Shedden, the deputy City Architect who held the position temporarily. Upon taking the position, he designed a revised masterplan for the Castle Bromwich Airfield estate. The new masterplan used the Radburn Layout which consisted of super-blocks of housing, schools, retail and offices around a communal open space, a concept which was created by Clarence Stein in Radburn, New Jersey in 1929.|$|E
50|$|The gaol {{was last}} {{used in the}} 1930s during the Great Depression as a police lock-up. By 1941 the goal was put up for sale by the Public Works Department as it was <b>declared</b> <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>habitation.</b> It {{remained}} {{in a state of}} disrepair and was restored between 1989 and 1996 to become a museum.|$|E
50|$|The Industrial Revolution brought {{factories}} {{such as the}} Albion Steel Works, the English Crown Spelter Works and the Baglan Bay Tinplate Works. These {{were built}} on land close to the River Neath and the new South Wales Railway, built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. In 1840 an area of about 750 acre of land in Cwmafan was leased for 99 years to John Vigurs and subsequently passed to Wright, Butler & Co. Ltd, then to Baldwins Ltd. The terraces of houses built on this land were sublet in 1897 and 1898 {{for the remainder of}} the term of this lease, but many were <b>declared</b> <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>habitation</b> in the 1930s, and demolished.|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} has {{a total of}} 11 dwellings that were built in 1986. Four of the houses were demolished in 2014 after being <b>declared</b> <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> human <b>habitation.</b>|$|R

50|$|During {{much of the}} 19th {{century and}} into the 20th century, the {{buildings}} of Blackfriars were neglected and fell into an increasingly bad state of repair. In 1937 the Saddlers’ property was <b>declared</b> as <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> human <b>habitation.</b>|$|R
50|$|Reconstruction {{efforts were}} done but were halted in 1688 because {{the place was}} <b>declared</b> <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>habitation.</b> Construction resumed in 1696 under the {{supervision}} of Fr. Francisco de Mondejar and through the generosity of a pious person, Don Tomas de Endaya, and the stone church was completed in 1699. The convent was also reconstructed alongside the church. It was also during this time when the baroque altar was installed. The new stone church was dedicated to then newly Blessed Pedro Bautista and to his companion martyrs who were beatified by Pope Urban VIII on September 14, 1627. They were canonized after almost a century and half on June 8, 1862 by Pope Pius IX.|$|E
5000|$|More {{than forty}} homes in Long Branch were lost {{at the mouth}} of the Etobicoke Creek due to {{flooding}} caused by Hurricane Hazel. Long Branch's dead from the hurricane were: Mr and Mrs Ed Crymble and their daughter Clifford; Patricia and Robert Thorpe; and Mrs. Thorpe's mother, Mrs. Robert Johnston. The Thorpe's baby daughter Nancy survived. The baby had been handed to 17-year-old Sylvia Jones while the area was being abandoned. Jones climbed onto a nearby roof and the two were later saved by fire fighters. The Thorpe's house was one of the ones washed away into Lake Ontario. Nancy Thorpe was later adopted by her aunt and uncle. The O'Farrell family escaped when their house floated down the river, by climbing onto trees that their house crashed into. Thirty-five persons survived on the roof of one house that was held back from Lake Ontario by two trees the house had crashed into. According to Long Branch Reeve Marie Curtis, [...] "if it hadn't been for the trees, which held the houses back, half of them would have been swept out into the lake." [...] 147 cottages at the mouth were <b>declared</b> <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>habitation</b> after the flooding when sanitation facilities broke down.|$|E

5|$|After the First World War, the Urban District Council, {{which had}} {{replaced}} the District Board in 1894, began a programme of urban improvement. Large areas of open farmland were purchased for the building of council houses, and a notorious slum area, Ogley Square, which had been <b>declared</b> <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> human <b>habitation,</b> was demolished after a long legal dispute and the tenants rehoused. The final farmland {{within the boundaries of}} Brownhills was sold for redevelopment in 1952.|$|R
50|$|In 1940 {{the castle}} and house {{was bought by}} Barbara Wood, {{daughter}} of a shipping magnate, who moved into Castle Green House with her mother. This fell into disrepair in the 1940s and was allowed to decay further by the owner {{to the extent that}} the outer walls needed supporting. Miss Woods continued to occupy the castle for almost 60 years, despite attempts by the local authority to take over the castle in 1971 and Castle Green House being <b>declared</b> <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> human <b>habitation</b> in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|The Hall {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a residence until the 19th century, when it became tenement flats and gradually fell into disrepair. In 1936 the building was <b>declared</b> <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> human <b>habitation,</b> and was rescued from demolition by Fred Hill, a local teacher, who created what is now the [...] "Friends of the Old Hall" [...] to press for restoration of the building. Preservation work stopped during World War II, but was completed in 1955. In 1957 the National Trust assumed responsibility for the building.|$|R
50|$|The London Fire Brigade and {{structural}} surveyors assessed the damage {{and structural}} safety of affected properties. In the meantime, several hundred people were displaced from their homes until they had been declared safe for their occupants to return. Brent Council, speaking to a national newspaper, announced {{that none of the}} affected properties are likely to be demolished, though a total of 29 homes have been <b>declared</b> as <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>habitation</b> due to the damage caused by the tornado. A local MP is attempting to set up a relief fund for residents not covered by insurance, Brent Council rehoused 12 of the people affected.|$|R
50|$|Those {{six years}} {{would be the most}} {{comfortable}} for Kelly. In September 1817, Plessis once again decided a new challenge was in order. Kelly was posted to the large parish of Saint-Pierre, in William Henry (Sorel). Kelly came face-to-face with the notorious fur traders, who were less than receptive to his sermons. Three years later, Kelly refused an even more difficult assignment from Plessis, further into the northwest, wanting less of the fur traders, not more of them. The Saint-Pierre presbytery may have been preferable to the wilderness, but by 1819 it was <b>declared</b> dangerously <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>habitation.</b> It wasn't until 1832 that a new presbytery was built, using stone from the original.|$|R
50|$|Mr Whittington bred prize poultry. He {{bought a}} long farm lease, induced by Seale-Hayne's {{representation}} that the premises were sanitary {{and in good}} repair. However, the water supply was poisoned, Mr Whittington’s manager got very ill and the poultry died. Under the lease, Mr Whittington had covenanted to carry out repairs required by the council, which were needed after the council <b>declared</b> the premises <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>habitation</b> and the drains needed renewing. It was undisputed that Whittington was entitled to indemnity for rates paid or repairs costs. Whittington sought rescission and indemnity for loss of poultry, profits and medical expenses.|$|R
