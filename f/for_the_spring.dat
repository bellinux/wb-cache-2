5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a closed season is in place <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E

5|$|The 2015 race {{consisted}} of six stages. It started in Dukhan on 8 February 2015 and finished on 13 February in Doha, {{the capital city}} of Qatar. The Tour of Qatar puts unusual demands on riders: it has no significant climbs, but almost every stage is affected by strong crosswinds. These conditions make the race ideal preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> classics season, so many prominent classics riders were present. The flat stages, suitable for sprinters, and individual time trial meant that specialists in these disciplines also chose to ride in Qatar.|$|E
5|$|After {{the island}} was {{evacuated}} it was first tenanted and then purchased in 1919 by Jonathan MacLean from Barra. In 1930 it was sold to John Russell who had experience as a sheep farmer in both Australia and Montana. Russell was clearly a man who liked his own company, choosing {{to live on the}} island alone all autumn and winter with his pet ferrets and cats, and joined by two shepherds <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> and summer only. After seven years he sold up to Peggy Greer, a farmer from Essex who visited only rarely and let the grazings out to local farmers. In 1951 she attempted to sell the island herself, but without success until 1955 when a local crofters' syndicate called the Barra Head Isles Sheepstock Company completed the purchase. The advent of motor boats made stocking the islands considerably easier and the companyâ€™s ownership continued for the next forty years.|$|E

5|$|In April 1864, Beauregard {{saw little}} {{opportunity}} for military glory because he foresaw {{that there would}} be no more significant assaults against Charleston, and prospects for a major field command were unlikely. He requested a leave to recover from fatigue and a chronic throat ailment, but he instead received an order to report to Weldon, North Carolina, near the Virginia border, to play a key role in the defense of Virginia. His new assignment, the Department of North Carolina and Cape Fear, also included Virginia south of the James River. When he took command on April 18, he renamed it, on his own initiative, the Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. The Confederates were preparing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> offensive of Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and were concerned that attacks south of Richmond could interrupt the critical supply lines to Richmond and the army of Robert E. Lee.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{stood out}} of Norfolk 7 September 1955 for her first tour of duty with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean.

She returned to Norfolk 7 January 1956 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> program of training operations. That summer she again carried midshipmen to Northern Europe for training, bringing them home to Annapolis 31 July. New Jersey sailed for Europe once more 27 August as flagship of Vice Admiral Charles Wellborn, Jr., Commander United States Second Fleet. She called at Lisbon, participated in NATO exercises off Scotland, and paid an official visit to Norway where Crown Prince Olav was a guest. She returned to Norfolk 15 October, and 14 December arrived at New York Naval Shipyard for inactivation. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Bayonne 21 August 1957.|$|E

5|$|The Tour of Qatar {{is one of}} {{the early}} races in the season, coming in the middle of three races in the Middle East (alongside the Dubai Tour and the Tour of Oman) that see high levels of {{participation}} from the top European teams. The race is particularly popular as a preparation race for riders aiming <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> classics. The significant challenge in the Tour of Qatar is the strong winds across the desert, which frequently cause the peloton to split into echelons. As well as attracting the top classics riders, the flat nature of the course means many stages can be won by sprinters; the individual time trial also attracts many of the time trial specialists, who have a chance of overall victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminary}} hearing began on March 13, 1951, and lasted three days, {{during which the}} Crown called 20witnesses. Diefenbaker alleged that {{the rules of the}} CNR did not require that the telegraph operator listen to the repeat of his message, but merely recommended that he should. Nevertheless, Diefenbaker's motion to dismiss was unsuccessful and Atherton was committed for trial before the Supreme Court of British Columbia (a trial-level court). Manslaughter was a charge for which the accused did not have the option of a speedy trial before a county court judge, and Atherton's case was set <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spring</b> Assizes in Prince George.|$|E
5|$|While the Picts and Scots {{would have}} {{remained}} pagan, most scholars presume that Christianity would have survived after {{the departure of}} the Romans among the Brythonic enclaves and retreated as the Anglo-Saxons advanced north. Their gods included Tiw, Woden, Thor and Frig, all of whom gave their names to days of the week, and Eostre, whose name was appropriated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> festival of Easter. While British Christians continued to practice inhumation without grave goods, the pagan Anglo-Saxons are visible in the archaeological record from their practice of cremation and burial in urns, accompanied by extensive grave goods, perhaps designed to accompany the dead to the afterlife. However, despite growing evidence of Anglian settlement in southern Scotland, only one such grave has been found, at Dalmeny in East Lothian.|$|E

5|$|After Cedar Creek, {{the army}} {{stayed in the}} {{vicinity}} through election day, when McKinley cast his first presidential ballot, for the incumbent Republican, Abraham Lincoln. The next day, they moved north up the valley into winter quarters near Kernstown. In February 1865, Crook was captured by Confederate raiders. Crook's capture added to the confusion as the army was reorganized <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> campaign, and McKinley found himself serving on the staffs of four different generals over the next fifteen daysâ€”Crook, John D. Stevenson, Samuel S. Carroll, and Winfield S. Hancock. Finally assigned to Carroll's staff again, McKinley acted as the general's first and only adjutant. Lee and his army surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant a few days later, effectively ending the war. McKinley found time to join a Freemason lodge (later renamed after him) in Winchester, Virginia, before he and Carroll were transferred to Hancock's First Veterans Corps in Washington. Just before the war's end, McKinley received his final promotion, a brevet commission as major. In July, the Veterans Corps was mustered out of service, and McKinley and Carroll were relieved of their duties. Carroll and Hancock encouraged McKinley {{to apply for a}} place in the peacetime army, but he declined and returned to Ohio the following month.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> 1797 campaign, Bonaparte {{organized}} {{his army}} into eight divisions {{of which the}} 3rd Division under SÃ©rurier counted 6,543 soldiers. In the Battle of Valvasone on 16 March, Bonaparte drove back the rear guard of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. During the operation SÃ©rurier's division was in reserve, but in the subsequent advance {{it was on the}} right flank while Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's division was in the center and Guieu's division was on the left flank. On 19 March Bernadotte attacked Gradisca d'Isonzo and was repulsed. After SÃ©rurier's division swung around the south side of Gradisca and gained the heights {{in the rear of the}} town, the garrison surrendered. The French captured four battalions of Austrian infantry totaling 2,500 soldiers, 10 guns and eight colors. While Bernadotte continued advancing to the east, Guieu's division followed by SÃ©rurier turned north in pursuit of a column under Adam Bajalics von Bajahaza. At this time SÃ©rurier fell ill and command of his division passed to Louis FranÃ§ois Jean Chabot. Trapped between Massena and Guieu, Bajalics was forced to surrender with 4,000 men in the Battle of Tarvis. After recovering, SÃ©rurier resumed command of his division at Graz on 20 April and after the Treaty of Leoben the unit withdrew from Austria and took position at Sacile.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Christianity in Scotland can {{probably}} be {{found among the}} soldiers and ordinary Roman citizens {{in the vicinity of}} Hadrian's Wall. The archaeology of the Roman period indicates that the northern parts of the Roman province of Britannia were among the most Christianised in the island. Chi-Rho inscriptions and Christian grave-slabs have been found on the wall from the 4th century, and from the same period the Mithraic shrines (known as Mithraea) which existed along Hadrian's Wall were attacked and destroyed, presumably by Christians. After the departure of the Romans it is generally presumed that Christianity would have survived among the Bythonic enclaves such as Strathclyde, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced, with their gods Tiw, Woden, Thor and Frig, all of whom gave their names to days of the week, and Eostre, whose name was appropriated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> festival of Easter. While British Christians continued to practice inhumation without grave goods, the pagan Anglo-Saxons are visible in the archaeological record from their practice of cremation and burial in urns, accompanied by extensive grave goods, perhaps designed to accompany the dead to the afterlife.

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents an}} Initial Conservation Policy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> historic heritage of <b>the</b> <b>Springs</b> Precinct, Wellington Park, Tasmania.

A more comprehensive Conservation Management Plan is to be developed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Springs</b> in <b>the</b> longer term. The aim of the Initial Conservation Policy is to provide guidance in relation to the sound conservation and management of the historic heritage values of <b>the</b> <b>Springs</b> area in <b>the</b> short term as the history of use of <b>the</b> <b>Springs</b> has created significant cultural heritage values in the area. The Initial Conservation Policy is based on currently available information with some additional research having been undertaken in areas for which there was unacceptably limited information (ie, the history, physical remains and social values). <b>The</b> need <b>for</b> historic heritage conservation policy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Springs</b> arises from <b>the</b> need to manage the extensive, but previously poorly known, historic heritage values in an area that is also the primary development and use focus in Wellington Park. This is particularly critical given the reserved land management context of <b>the</b> <b>Springs</b> and Mt Wellington more generally <b>for</b> which <b>the</b> primary management objectives are the protection of the natural and cultural values and the maintenance of water quality, with use needing to be consistent with the protective goals...|$|R
