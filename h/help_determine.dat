5|$|DVT {{diagnosis}} {{requires the}} use of imaging devices such as ultrasound. Clinical assessments, which predict DVT likelihood, can <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> if a D-dimer test is useful. In those not highly likely to have DVT, a normal D-dimer result can rule out a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on which}} bones are present, sex can be {{determined}} by looking for distinctive sexual dimorphisms. When available, the pelvis is extremely useful in the determination of sex and when properly examined can achieve sex determination with a great level of accuracy. The examination of the pubic arch {{and the location of}} the sacrum can <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> sex.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, various national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts issue forecasts of hurricane activity. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), as well as Weather Research Center (WRC) and Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), then known as TSUNAMI. The forecasts include weekly or monthly assessments of the significant factors that <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year.|$|E
5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to see other markers present on the bones. Past {{fractures}} will be evident {{by the presence of}} bone remodeling. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E
5|$|Because {{strontium}} is {{so similar}} to calcium, it {{is incorporated in}} the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly the same proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.|$|E

5|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or discoloration, and distention of surface veins, although about half of those with the condition have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E
5|$|Currently, astronomers {{know little}} about the shape and size of our galaxy {{relative}} to {{what they know about}} other galaxies; it is difficult to observe the entire Milky Way from the inside. A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars.|$|E
5|$|For pilots, {{knowledge}} of the sky cover helps determine if visual flight rules (VFR) are being met. Knowing the degree of cloud cover can <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> whether or not various weather fronts, such as cold fronts or warm fronts, have passed by a location. A nephanalysis, contouring areas that are cloudy with scalloped lines, can be performed to indicate a system's cloud and precipitation pattern. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E

50|$|Vascular {{ultrasonography}} is {{the main}} branch of radiology that uses duplex. Vascular ultrasonography, a sub-specialty within ultrasonography, <b>helps</b> <b>determine</b> multiple factors within the circulatory system. It can evaluate central (abdominal) and peripheral arteries and veins; it <b>helps</b> <b>determine</b> the amount of vascular stenosis (narrowing) or occlusion (complete blockage) within an artery; it assists in ruling out aneurysmal disease; and it {{is the main}} aid to rule out thrombotic events. Duplex is an inexpensive, non-invasive way to determine pathology.|$|R
5|$|Forensic archaeologists can <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> {{potential}} grave {{sites that}} might have been overlooked. Differences in the soil can help forensic archaeologists locate these sites. During the burial of a body, a small mound of soil will form from the filling of the grave. The loose soil and increasing nutrients from the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas. Typically, grave sites will have looser, darker, more organic soil than areas around it. The search for additional grave sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and mass graves to search for additional burial locations.|$|E
5|$|Geotaphonomy is the {{examination}} of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton {{was a result of}} peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.|$|E
5|$|Surface weather {{analyses}} {{have special}} symbols that show frontal systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information. For example, an H may represent high pressure, implying clear skies and relatively warm weather. An L, {{on the other}} hand, may represent low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map. Areas of precipitation <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> the frontal type and location.|$|E

Otherwise, {{they will be in}} units of degrees Celsius. This knowledge is important to meteorologists because when this data is plotted on a map, isotherms and isodrosotherms (lines of equal dew point) are easily analyzed, either by man or machine, which can <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> location of weather fronts.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} the season, several {{meteorological}} services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of the University College London, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO), Coastal Carolina University (CCU), Colorado State University (CSU), and North Carolina State University (NCSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the predicted weakening of the 2014–16 El Niño event. On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, and two major hurricanes, with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of between 66 and 103 units.|$|E
5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony {{can be as}} {{important}} as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case of}} Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, as in the case of Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E
