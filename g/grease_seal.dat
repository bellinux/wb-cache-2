40|$|Hemerocallis plantlets {{maintained}} in vitro {{for extended periods}} of time in tightly closed culture vessels frequently show a phenotype, albeit on a miniaturized scale, typical of more mature, field-grown plants. The positive relationship of elevated ethylene in the headspace of such vessels to the phase shift from juvenile to mature form is established. Rigorous restriction in air exchange with the external environment by means of silicone <b>grease</b> <b>seals</b> hastens the phase change and improves uniformity of response. Although some plantlets may take longer to accumulate enough ethylene in sealed jars to undergo change, added ethylene and ethylene-releasing agents promote it. Ethylene adsorbants (e. g. mercuric perchlorate) block the shift of juvenile to mature form. Critical ambient ethylene level for the shift is ca 1 microliter l- 1. Levels up to 1000 microliters l- 1 do not hasten the response but are not toxic. The phase change is fully reversible when air exchange permits ethylene to drop below 1 microliter l- 1. At least 1 microliter l- 1 ethylene is required to sustain the mature phenotype. The ethylene synthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) prevents the phase change, while the ethylene biosynthesis intermediate 1 -aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACC) improves it. KOH, as a CO 2 absorbent, does not prevent the phase change. Histology sections demonstrate subtle changes in the form of shoot tips of plantlets undergoing phase change...|$|R

40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} contain seals to keep lubricant {{inside and}} contamination outside the bearing system. These bearings {{are more often}} lubricated with grease rather than oil. Much knowledge is available on oil lubricated seals but {{a good understanding of}} <b>grease</b> lubricated <b>seals</b> is lacking. In this thesis, first the lubrication, pumping and sealing mechanisms of oil and grease lubricated radial lip seals have been discussed. The first paper reviews the public literature. This review has shown that very little is known on grease lubrication in radial lip seals. The primary lubrication, sealing and pumping mechanisms found for oil lubricated seals are micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication between the seal and shaft roughness and tangential deformations of the seal surface for a pumping action. These mechanisms are important but it is felt that other effects have to be included for explaining differences seen in grease lubricated radial lip seals. One effect in grease lubrication is the normal stress effect which is described in the second paper. It is shown that the grease rheology and especially the normal stress effect {{play a significant role in}} film formation in <b>grease</b> lubricated <b>seals.</b> The model predicts that 50 to 60 % of the load carrying capacity can be generated by the normal stress effect for a low contact pressure bearing seal depending on the operating conditions. The oil bleed model presented in the third paper describes the release of oil from the grease. This model is based on viscous flow through the porous soap microstructure and the driving force is the pressure gradient resulting from centripetal forces. It is shown that the soap fibre distribution has to become anisotropic during oil bleed and the model has been validated with experiments at different temperatures and rotating speeds. The model can be used with good confidence for longer periods of time and can be used as input for replenishment models.

40|$|Rolling {{bearings}} contain seals to keep lubricant {{inside and}} contaminants outside the bearing system. These systems are often lubricated with grease; the grease {{acts as a}} lubricant for the bearing and seal and improves the sealing efficiency. In this thesis, the influence of lubricating <b>grease</b> on bearing <b>seal</b> performance is studied. Rheological properties of the grease, i. e. shear stress and normal stress difference, are evaluated and related to the lubricating and sealing performance of the sealing system. This includes the <b>seal,</b> <b>grease</b> and counterface. The grease velocity profile in the seal pocket in-between two sealing lips {{is dependent on the}} rheological properties of the grease. The velocity profile in a wide pocket is evaluated using a 1 -dimensional model based on the Herschel-Bulkley model. The velocity profile in a narrow pocket, where the influence of the side walls on the velocity profile is significant, is measured using micro particle image velocimetry. Subsequently, the radial migration of contaminants into the seal pocket is modelled and related to the sealing function of the grease. Additionally, also migration in the axial direction is found {{in the vicinity of the}} sealing contact. Experimental results show that contaminant particles in different greases consistently migrate either away from the sealing contact or towards the sealing contact, also when the pumping rate of the seal can be neglected. Lubrication of the seal lip contact is dependent on several grease properties. A lubricant film in the sealing contact may be built up as in oil lubricated seals but normal stress differences in the grease within the vicinity of the contact may result in an additional lift force. The grease, which is being sheared in the vicinity of the contact, will also contribute to the frictional torque. It is important to maintain a lubricant film in the sealing contact to minimize friction and wear. Here the replenishment of oil separated from the grease, also referred to as oil bleed, is of crucial importance. A model is presented to predict this oil bleed based on oil flow through the porous grease thickener microstructure. The model is applied to an axial sealing contact and a prediction of the film thickness as a function of time is made. The work presented in the thesis gives a significant contribution to a better understanding of the influence of lubricating <b>grease</b> on the <b>sealing</b> system performance and seal lubrication conditions.

In high dynamic special applications, the friction significantly affects the moving behaviour. In contrast to previous steady-state investigations, the seal friction is considered in the context of this work as a function of acceleration. For this purpose, experimental as well as numerical methods are developed. Measurements of the friction forces of hydraulic rod seals are carried out using a test rig driven by a crank mechanism. The results for different seal geometries, varying pressures and temperatures at speeds of up to 10 m/s are discussed. In addition, a newly developed measurement principle for pneumatic rod seals is designed and enables to detect the seal friction with minimised disturbances. The influence of seal geometry, material, installation situation, pressure, <b>grease</b> and <b>seal</b> dimensions are systematically investigated using the pneumatic test rig. Due to the increasing importance of analytical and numerical methods in the development process of sealing systems, two simulation approaches are presented to calculate the friction force. The well-known inverse hydrodynamic approach (IHL) is a simplified calculation method, whereas the developed elastohydrodynamic model (EHD or EHL) allows a physically more accurate reproduction. Finally, comparisons between measurements using an O-ring operated at different conditions and corresponding simulations show the suitability of the numerical models for hydrodynamic lubrication conditions...|$|R
40|$|The film {{formation}} in lip seals, {{due to the}} non-Newtonian rheology of the lubricant, has been a topic of speculation.

We use a modified concentric cylinder geometry and a model fluid to study the fluid pressure distribution in the seal-type geometry. The results are then related to grease-lubricated seals and our earlier theoretical predictions. The present analysis shows that this earlier work and our earlier predictions are not correct and indicate that normal stresses in the <b>grease</b> pull the <b>seal</b> lip toward the shaft, increasing the contact pressure.

40|$|Constant {{velocity}} (CV) joints {{have been}} widely used for modern vehicles. The <b>sealed</b> <b>grease</b> of CV joints must pro-vide low friction and wear protection for the lifetime use of the vehicle. Grease performance affects the vibration and noise level in the vehicle.

In this article, the grease degradation phenomenon in CV joints is investigated by collecting grease samples from both tripod joints and Birfield joints in actual vehicles that traveled various ranges of distance. In order to analyze the property changes of grease, grease penetration and oxidation induced time are measured using a penetration meter and infrared (IR) spectrometer, respectively. Where oxygen in-duced time (OIT) is the point that the oxidation occurs in grease.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) has long been used as a method of determining viscoelastic mechanical properties of polymeric materials. More recently, DMA has been used for characterizing the fiber/matrix interface in composite materials. The present work has adopted this approach to determine the viscoelastic properties of cortical bone in torsion. Very little work has been done in the area of determining the storage and loss moduli of compact bone, with the notable exception of Lakes el al. (J. Biomechanics, Vol. 12, pp. 689 - 698, 1979). Moreover, no studies have correlated the viscoelastic properties of bone to microstructural parameters, such as wet density, dry density, porosity, and percent mineralization. Specimens of cortical bone were taken from equine third metacarpal bones and machined into rectangular slabs approximately 46 mm long, 10 mm wide, and 2 mm thick. After initial testing to determine the linear viscoelastic region of equine compact bone, the specimens were tested in a Rheometrics RDS- 11 machine. The specimens were tested moist at a constant strain amplitude of 0. 015 % in frequency sweeps over three decades (0, I-I 00 rad/s). A slice from the nu'd-section of each specimen was then microradiographed and the image analyzed using image analysis software on a PC. The porosity, percent secondary Haversian area, and extent of cement lines were measured. Wet density, dry density, and ash weight measurements were made from additional samples cut from the specimen mid-section. Effects of the <b>grease</b> used to <b>seal</b> in moisture content prohibited conclusive results for the correlation of mechanical moduli to the densities for the entire set of test specimens. There was, however, a significant positive correlation between the mechanical moduli and the wet and dry density for each independent set of tests. The porosity generally reduced the mechanical moduli of cortical bone tissue. However, this relationship was only n-u'ld in strength. The effect of cement lines on material damping did not produce conclusive results. This is most likely the result {{of a large number of}} specimens dominated by primary bone. This disparity of mineralization probably did not isolate the mechanical behavior of the cement line enough to show a significant trend...|$|R
40|$|Lubricating grease is {{commonly}} applied to lubricate e. g. rolling bearings, <b>seals</b> and gears. <b>Grease</b> has some clear advantages over lubricating oil. It is a semi-solid material, which prevents it from flowing/leaking {{out from the}} lubricated system and gives it sealing properties, protecting the system against contaminants. Unlike oil, grease has a much more complicated rheology, which {{makes it more difficult}} to model and understand grease flow. Grease acts as a lubricant reservoir, and understanding grease flow is essential in order to model and predict how grease is transported within e. g., a rolling element bearing housing, a sealing arrangement or replenishment of a gear mesh. Three greases with different rheological behaviors (NLGI 2 grease, NLGI 1 grease and NLGI 00 grease) have been used in two kinds of test rigs: a straight channel with different restrictions and a rotating shaft with two narrow gap sealing-like restrictions. In the first test rig two types of flow restrictions were applied into a straight channel in order to simulate flow of <b>grease</b> near a <b>sealing</b> pocket. In the case of a single restriction, the distance required for the velocity profile to fully develop when going from a wide to a narrow gap is approximately the same as the initial height of the channel. In the corner pocket before and after the restriction, the velocity is very low and part of the grease is stationary. For the channel with two flow restrictions, this effect is even more pronounced in the “pocket” between the restrictions. Clearly, {{a large part of the}} grease is not moving since the yield stress of the grease is not exceeded. This condition particularly applies to the cases with a low-pressure gradient and where high consistency grease is used. In practice this means that grease is not replaced in such “pockets” and that some aged/contaminated grease will remain there. A test rig comprising of a rotating shaft with two narrow gap sealing-like restrictions (a so called Double Restriction Seal, DRS) was designed to simulate the a labyrinth type of seal. Two different gap heights in the DRS have been designed to compare grease flow. It is shown that partially yielded grease is detected in the large gap geometry and fully yielded grease in the small gap geometry. Grease shear thinning behavior and wall slip effects have been detected and discussed. For the small gap geometry, it is shown that three distinct grease flow regions are present: a slip layer close to the stationary wall, a bulk flow layer, and a slip layer near the rotating shaft.

Grease has some clear advantages over lubricating oil: it is a semisolidmaterial, which prevents it from flowing/ leaking {{out from the}} bearingsystem and gives it sealing properties, and it also protects the system fromcontaminants and corrosion. Due to its consistency, lubricating grease has manyadditional advantages over lubricating oil: {{it does not require}} pumps, filters andsumps. However, the rheology of grease makes it more difficult to measure andstudy its flow dynamics. This study focuses on the influence of rheology ongrease flow in different geometries involving a straight channel with restrictions,concentric cylinder geometry, and free-surface flow on a rotating disc. To better understand grease flow in bearings and seals, two types of flowrestrictions were applied into the straight channel in order to simulate the flowof <b>grease</b> near a <b>seal</b> pocket. In the case of a single restriction, the horizontaldistance required for the velocity profile to fully develop is approximately thesame as the height of the channel.

A configuration comprising a rotating shaft and two narrow gap sealing-likerestrictions (also called Double Restriction Seal, DRS) was designed to simulatea sealing contact. Two different gap heights in the DRS have been used tocompare the grease flow. It is shown that partially yielded grease flow isdetected in the large gap geometry and fully yielded grease flow in the small gapgeometry. For the small gap geometry, it is shown that three distinct grease flowregions are present: a slip layer close to the stationary wall, a bulk flow layer,and a slip layer near the rotating shaft. The shear thinning behaviour of thegrease and its wall slip effects have been determined and discussed. Free-surface flow of grease occurs in a variety of situations such as during relubrication and inside a rolling element bearing which is filled to about 30 %with grease in order to prevent heavy churning. Here the reflow of lubricant tothe bearing races is a key point in the lubricant film build-up, and centrifugalforces have a direct impact on the amount of available grease. Understanding ofthe free-surface flow behaviour of grease is hence important for theunderstanding of the lubrication mechanism. Adhesion and mass loss aremeasured for greases with different rheology on different surfaces andtemperatures. It is shown that the critical speed at which the grease starts tomove is mostly determined by grease type, yield stress and temperature ratherthan surface material. A developed analytical model covers a stationary analysisof the flow resulting in solutions for the velocity profile of the grease as well as asolution for the thickness of the viscous layer remaining on the disc.
