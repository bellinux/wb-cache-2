5|$|Despite England {{going into}} the series as the favourites, West Indies won the series 1â€“0 after winning the first match at Sabina Park. The {{remaining}} matches all ended in draws. The series was originally intended as a four Test series; however the abandonment of the Second Test due to {{the conditions of the}} <b>field</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> SVR Stadium in Antigua led to the rapid inclusion of an additional game staged at the Antigua Recreation Ground, resulting in a five, rather than four match Test series.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, astronomers using {{computer}} simulations speculated {{that even if}} Betelgeuse is not rotating it might exhibit large-scale magnetic activity in its extended atmosphere, a factor where even moderately strong fields could have a meaningful influence over the star's dust, wind and mass-loss properties. A series of spectropolarimetric observations obtained in 2010 with the Bernard Lyot Telescope at Pic du Midi Observatory revealed {{the presence of a}} weak magnetic <b>field</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> surface of Betelgeuse, suggesting that the giant convective motions of supergiant stars are able to trigger the onset of a small-scale dynamo effect.|$|E
5|$|In the free-electron laser (FEL), a {{relativistic}} {{electron beam}} passes through a pair of undulators that contain arrays of dipole magnets whose fields point in alternating directions. The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation <b>field</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> resonance frequency. FEL can emit a coherent high-brilliance electromagnetic radiation {{with a wide range}} of frequencies, from microwaves to soft X-rays. These devices are used in manufacturing, communication, and in medical applications, such as soft tissue surgery.|$|E

5|$|Some of the charged {{particles}} do {{get into the}} magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing {{back and forth between}} the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Earth's surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the aurorae and also emit X-rays.|$|E
5|$|That same year, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) was established, {{becoming}} the international governing body for track and field, and it enshrined amateurism {{as one of}} its founding principles for the sport. The National Collegiate Athletic Association held their first Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in 1921, {{making it one of the}} most prestigious competitions for students, and this was soon followed by the introduction of track and <b>field</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> inaugural World Student Games in 1923. The first continental track and field competition was the 1919 South American Championships, which was followed by the European Athletics Championships in 1934.|$|E
5|$|The Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company {{was founded}} in 1886 in order to span the Missouri River. In the late 1880s the city had five {{franchise}} companies providing transit services within city limits. They included the Omaha and Southwestern Street Railway Company, which provided services to Kountze Place, Dundee, Bemis Park and the Gold Coast neighborhoods. Short lines ran with limited purposes: one went only to a baseball <b>field</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of its line, while another ran to and from a park.|$|E

The astroturf was replaced by grass in 1995. The stadium officially holds 55,000 but has held up to 56,412 in 2005 and 56,680 in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech downed Texas' {{subsequent}} kickoff in its {{end zone}} for a touchback, and the Hokies attempted {{to answer the}} Texas score starting at the Tech 20-yard line. During the first play after the kickoff, Texas and Tech both committed penalties. After the penalties, Tech had a first down at its 27-yard line. After the penalties, running back Ken Oxendine attempted to run up {{the middle of the}} field, but had the ball knocked loose by defender Tony Brackens. Texas recovered the fumble and the Longhorns' offense returned to the <b>field</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tech 32-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Adams still {{uses the}} same 26-inch-wide bass drum he began with in 1973. He has stated that he bought {{it as part of}} a set for $25 at a garage sale. It has the same head {{on the side of the}} drum that Adams does not beat, but Adams has stated that he replaces the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets of mallets each year. During games, Adams tends to drum at {{particular}} moments: when the Indians take the <b>field</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the game, if the Indians have runners in scoring position, if the Indians are tied or trailing near the end of the game, or if they are winning at the top of the ninth inning. Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer Herb Score. It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official.|$|E
