500|$|In {{the third}} match, in Bridgetown, Barbados, Boycott was to face what was later {{said to be}} Holding's {{greatest}} over. Boycott was hit on the gloves by the first delivery, played-and-missed the second outside off stump, was hit on the thigh by the third, fended the next two deliveries away with his bat, and was then bowled by the final delivery. Though in 1987 Boycott would claim a 1966 delivery by Gary Sobers {{to be the best}} he ever faced in cricket, he noted of Holding's over that [...] "for {{the first time in my}} life <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a scoreboard with a duck against my name and not feel a profound sense of failure." [...] Boycott led an England fight back in the fourth Test. Having watched Holding's over several times on video, and worked in the nets on his game, Boycott came out and made 38 in the first innings and then hit his twentieth Test century. His career run total was now 7,410, gaining on Gary Sobers' record of 8,032.|$|E

I wrote a {{movie called}} Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and I wrote a novel called The Princess Bride {{and those are the}} only two things I’ve ever written, not that I’m proud of, but that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> without humiliation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film's {{elevation}} to {{the status}} of a beloved classic came decades after its initial release, when it became a television staple during Christmas season in the late 1970s. This came as a welcome surprise to Frank Capra and others involved with its production. [...] "It's the damnedest thing I've ever seen," [...] Capra told The Wall Street Journal in 1984. [...] "The film has {{a life of its own}} now, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it like I had nothing to do with it. I'm like a parent whose kid grows up to be president. I'm proud... but it's the kid who did the work. I didn't even think of it as a Christmas story when I first ran across it. I just liked the idea." [...] In a 1946 interview, Capra described the film's theme as [...] "the individual's belief in himself" [...] and that he made it [...] "to combat a modern trend toward atheism".|$|E

60|$|I am thine {{to serve}} thee, Christian, {{so long as}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> out <b>at</b> those eyes, that have had so much dirt thrown at them by many.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not {{see what}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> the crowd there. When the waggons come up {{there will be a}} rush, and I have no men here to keep such a number in order." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{a glimpse}} of a large enclosure, with some big buildings. Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them better as I go back to Boston." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care {{which it}} is," [...] Walter said, [...] "so that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you;" [...] {{and this time}} Claire's cheeks were a good deal redder than Walter's.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course! Stop! You musn't sit {{all that}} way off--you must sit where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you. My {{attention}} wanders if I don't {{look at people}} while they read." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} did," [...] said Mrs. Phipps, thoughtfully, [...] "and I am sure I am much obliged to you. If there is {{anything}} of yours <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> after <b>at</b> any time I shall be only too pleased. When did you say Mr. Clarkson was coming back?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> never <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> those {{periodical}} {{portraits in}} THE GALAXY magazine without feeling a wild, tempestuous ambition {{to be an}} artist. I have seen {{thousands and thousands of}} pictures in my time--acres of them here and leagues of them in the galleries of Europe--but never any that moved me as these portraits do.|$|R
6000|$|... "And how do {{you like}} the Water-rat?" [...] asked the Duck, who came {{paddling}} up some minutes afterwards. [...] "He has a great many good points, but for my own part I have a mother's feelings, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O no," [...] replied Marco, [...] "I {{can find}} out {{when it is time}} for the recess. Let it be always at ten o'clock, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the watch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am comfortable,--and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you. Come;--there {{can be no}} harm {{in saying}} that, if I say nothing else. Well;--there, now I am gone." [...] Whereupon he got up from his arm-chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going back}} to school," [...] she announced. [...] "That is all there is left in life for me, now that my friend has been ruthlessly torn from me. In school <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her and muse over days departed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, Arabin, {{from one}} side only; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it from the other. It is very sweet to give; I do not doubt that. But the taking of what is given is very bitter. Gift bread chokes in a man's throat and poisons his blood, and sits like lead upon the heart. You have never tried it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right," [...] he answered, with {{a little}} sigh, [...] "and yet you must {{remember}} that you and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> scarcely <b>look</b> <b>at</b> things from the same standpoint. They do not affect you in the slightest. They cannot fail to remind me that I am after all an outcast, rescued from shipwreck by one strange turn in the wheel of chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} we can see, John. It is too cold for walking about talking here; and, besides, <b>I</b> think one <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a matter in all lights much better sitting down than one can walking about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is not," [...] {{pursued the}} nephew, in his former tone, [...] "a face <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> {{in all this}} country round about us, which looks at me with any {{deference}} on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{so glad to}} see you," [...] {{she said}} a little breathlessly, flinging her muff and boa on a chair. [...] "Sit there, where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you, and tell me why you didn't let me know you were coming to New York." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed! Ma says there's lots {{of books}} in one room, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> 'em while she goes round. May be I'll have time to read some, and then I can tell you," [...] {{answered}} Betty, who dearly loved stories, and seldom got any new ones.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hang me if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> {{any longer}} <b>at</b> {{the boys and}} the tarts!" [...] said Allan, {{dragging}} his friend away from the pastry-cook's shop. [...] "Let's try if we can't find something else to amuse us in the next street." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, what's {{the matter}} with the one y' got on? Ain't no holes in it that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see," [...] <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it {{carefully}} and turning her around {{as if she were}} on a pivot.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't let {{you tell}} Irene," [...] said the girl, letting fall her face on her mother's neck. [...] "Not Irene," [...] she moaned. [...] "I'm {{afraid to let}} you. How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish to {{have them}} for my own,' she answered, 'to carry them near my heart, and keep them in my room. They tempt me when they grow here; they seem to say, [...] "Come and do {{something}} with us;" [...] but once I have cut them and put them by, the charm is laid, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them with quite an easy heart.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have drawn}} me from far, Rachel, but I {{have never seen}} all of you before, only your face {{floating}} in the air before me, although others saw you. Now I see you also, so I suppose that my time has come. It will soon be over. Wait a little there, where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you, and presently we shall be together again. I am glad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish to {{have them}} for my own," [...] she answered, [...] "to carry them near my heart, and keep them in my room. They tempt me when they grow here; they seem to say, 'Come and do {{something}} with us'; but once I have cut them and put them by, the charm is laid, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them with quite an easy heart." ...|$|E
60|$|Here now, for instance, <b>at</b> Walworth, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> out <b>at</b> {{a window}} and see a nice green meadow with sheep and lambs feeding in it, which is some relief in this smutty old place. London is as smutty as Pittsburg or Wheeling. It takes a good hour's steady riding to get from here to West End; so that my American friends, of the newspapers, who are afraid I shall be {{corrupted}} by aristocratic associations, will see that I am at safe distance.|$|R
2500|$|Gove {{had been}} {{chairman}} of Policy Exchange, a {{conservative think tank}} launched in 2002. He was involved in founding the right-leaning magazine Standpoint, to which he occasionally contributes. Gove expressed admiration in late February 2003 for New Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair {{because of the way}} he was handling the crisis in Iraq: [...] "As a right-wing polemicist, all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Mr Blair now is, what's not to like?" [...] Blair, he thought, was [...] "behaving like a true Thatcherite".|$|R
5000|$|Modine used a Roleiflex camera, {{capturing}} {{glimpses of}} Kubrick's artistic and professional process. Full Metal Jacket Diary {{was published in}} limited edition book form in 2005 with a metal book jacket. [...] "I {{always wanted to do}} something with the pictures because I think they're beautiful..." [...] says Modine of his decision to publish the book. [...] "Now I feel enough time passed and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> back <b>at</b> those days as being part of another person's life, this young kid who went on a journey to work with a legend..." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{came back}} to Gloucester to-day, and to-morrow we are off for Buxton. As we are so near Stratford and Warwick and all that, Jone said we'd better go there on our way, but I wouldn't agree to it. I am too anxious to get him {{skipping}} round like a colt, as he used to, to stop anywhere now, {{and when we come}} back <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Shakespeare's tomb with a clearer conscience.|$|E
6000|$|... "The shock I have {{suffered}} {{has left a}} strange quietness in me. I feel as if I had parted from my former self--as if the hopes once so dear to me had all gone back to some past time from which I am now far removed. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the wreck of my life more calmly, Norah, than {{you could look at}} it if we were both together again. I can trust myself already to write to Frank.|$|E
6000|$|Called on C--, to explain----. She is very beautiful, to my taste, at least; for {{on coming}} home from abroad, I {{recollect}} being unable to look at any woman but her--they were so fair, and unmeaning, and blonde. The darkness and regularity of her features {{reminded me of my}} [...] "Jannat al Aden." [...] But this impression wore off; and now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a fair woman, without longing for a Houri. She was very good-tempered, and every thing was explained.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know you}} were still here," [...] she said, irrelevantly. [...] "I'm pretty liberal, my dear, as you know,--but {{this is more than}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> stand. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> them!" [...] She drew up her skirts as a woman brushed against her. [...] "I believe in the poor coming to church, and all that, but this is mere vulgar curiosity, the result of all that odious {{advertising}} in the newspapers. My pew is filled with them. If I had stayed, I should have fainted. I don't know what to think of Mr. Hodder." ...|$|R
60|$|Plays at {{that rate}} I do not think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{possibly}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> before July; so let that be a guide to you in your views. July, or August, or September, or thereabouts: these must be our times, whichever we attack. I think you had better suspend a visit till we can take you in and till <b>I</b> <b>can</b> speak. It seems a considerable waste of money; above all, as just now I could not even offer you meals with my woman {{in such a state}} of overwork. My father and mother have had to go to lodgings.--Post.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait one moment," [...] said I, {{seeing that}} the old man was heating himself with his narrative, and was likely, unless I stopped him, to talk more and more fluently to less and less purpose--"wait a moment. Have you {{preserved}} the paper that was pinned to the dead man's coat; and <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it?" ...|$|R
