With the benefits of this technology fully exploited, substantial increases of engine efficiency can be expected in the near future. However, this will lead to exhaust gas temperatures well below the range required for the catalytic removal of residual methane, which is a strong greenhouse gas. By combination with a countercurrent heat exchanger, the temperature level of the catalyst can be raised significantly {{in order to achieve}} sufficient levels of methane conversion with minimal additional fuel penalty.

40|$|Zeolites HY {{modified}} with palladium (0. 05 - 2. 5 wt. %) {{were found}} to be active and selective catalysts in the process of the selective oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen (NH 3 -SCO). Parent zeolite and its modifications with palladium were investigated with regard to their structural, textural, and redox properties. The IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and BET methods were employed for these purposes. Correlation between loading and aggregation of Pd-species deposited on zeolites and their activity and selectivity in the NH 3 -SCO process was found. Studies of adsorption forms of ammonia and product of its conversion done by IR spectroscopy as well as catalytic tests performed with various space velocities gave insight into the reaction mechanism.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the effect of different water <b>purification</b> <b>systems</b> on the fluoride content of drinking water and to compare the efficacy of these water <b>purification</b> <b>systems</b> in reducing the fluoride content. Materials and Methods: Five different water <b>purification</b> <b>systems</b> were tested in this study. They were reverse osmosis, distillation, activated carbon, Reviva &#x 00 AE;, and candle filter. The water samples in the study were of two types, viz, borewell water and tap water, these being commonly used by the people of Davangere City, Karnataka. The samples were collected before and after purification, and fluoride analysis was done using fluoride ion-specific electrode. Results: The results showed that the systems based on reverse osmosis, viz, reverse osmosis system and Reviva &#x 00 AE; showed maximum reduction in fluoride levels, the former proving to be more effective than the latter; followed by distillation and the activated carbon system, with the least reduction being brought about by candle filter. The amount of fluoride removed by the <b>purification</b> <b>system</b> varied between the system and from one source of water to the other. Interpretation and Conclusion: Considering the beneficial effects of fluoride on caries prevention; when drinking water is subjected to water <b>purification</b> <b>systems</b> that reduce fluoride significantly below the optimal level, fluoride supplementation may be necessary. The efficacy of systems based on reverse osmosis in reducing the fluoride content of water indicates their potential for use as defluoridation devices...|$|R

40|$|Objective　To {{evaluate}} the stability, {{safety and efficacy}} of mobile blood <b>purification</b> <b>system</b> {{in the treatment of}} acute renal failure dog model in the field environment. Methods　The acute renal failure model was established in 4 dogs by bilateral nephrectomy, which was thereafter treated with the mobile blood <b>purification</b> <b>system.</b> The evaluation of functional index of the mobile blood <b>purification</b> <b>system</b> was performed after a short-time (2 hours) and conventional (4 hours) dialysis treatment. Results　The mobile blood <b>purification</b> <b>system</b> ran stably in the field environment at a blood flow of 150 - 180 ml/min, a dialysate velocity of 2000 ml/h, a replacement fluid velocity of 2000 ml/h, and ultrafiltration rate of 100 - 200 ml/h. All the functions of alarming system worked well, including static upper limit alarm of ultrafiltration pressure (> 100 mmHg), upper limit alarm of ambulatory arterial pressure (> 400 mmHg), upper limit alarm of ambulatory venous pressure (> 400 mmHg), bubble alarm of vascular access, bubble alarm during the infusion of solutions, pressure alarm at the substitution pump segment and blood leaking alarm. The vital signs of the 4 dogs with acute renal failure kept stable during the treatment. After the treatment, a remarkable decrease was seen in the levels of serum urea nitrogen, creatinine and serum potassium (P 0. 05). Conclusions　The mobile blood <b>purification</b> <b>system</b> runs normally even in a field environment. It is a flexible and portable device with a great performance in safety and stability in the treatment of acute renal failure. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2013. 12. 1...|$|R
