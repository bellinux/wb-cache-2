An extensive programme {{of research on the}} toxicology of fibres has shown that persistence of some asbestos fibres in the lung {{as a result of their}} insolubility was an important determinant of carcinogenicity and <b>fibrogenicity,</b> and that fibre length was also critically important in determining toxicity. This research expanded to consider fibres and other materials introduced as substitutes for asbestos, such as calcium silicate and aramid fibres. From 1990, the Colt Foundation, relevant industries and the Health and Safety Executive supported a programme of laboratory research into the health effects of man-made mineral fibres that helped to clarify the quantitative relationships between health risks and fibre dimensions and biopersistence. This work was awarded the prestigious Bedford Prize by the British Occupational Hygiene Society.|$|E
40|$|Current {{methods for}} {{determining}} the <b>fibrogenicity</b> of substances are based on relatively long term exposures of animals to the substance and the evaluation of morphological changes occurring in the lung. The use of inhalation chambers, which produce a more physiological environment, suffer from the need for particularly long exposure times (1 - 3 years). The present study describes a technique using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive analysis, and a digitiser pad with a computer to evaluate the <b>fibrogenicity</b> of silica in cases of known exposure. Scanning electron micrographs taken from silicotic lungs were evaluated for the degree of thickening (fibrosis) and the same areas were analysed for silicon content. Correlations between silicon content and septal thickening were shown to be significant (p less than 0. 0001). The study also describes the concentrations of elements found in normal lungs. The technique for establishing correlation curves between elemental concentrations and septal thickening could be of value in determining the <b>fibrogenicity</b> of pure substances after short exposures in an environmental chamber...|$|E

40|$|As well as fibre size, fibre {{chemistry}} is a determinant of toxicity of mineral fibres. On these grounds, {{a few years}} ago, the asbestos industry in Québec developed a process to modify the surface chemistry of chrysotile asbestos by fixing phosphorous atoms. The pleuropulmonary <b>fibrogenicity</b> and carcinogenicity of the native and surface treated chrysotile, called chrysophosphate, were tested. Both products initiated similar pulmonary <b>fibrogenicity</b> in rats exposed by inhalation and sheep exposed by injection in the tracheal lobe. Tumour production in rats after long term inhalation or intrapleural injection was not different between chrysotile and chrysophosphate. These findings clearly show that modification of the phosphate surface of chrysotile fibres {{does not appear to}} alter the pleuropulmonary activities of the mineral, thus arguing against the earlier contention of less biological activity for chrysophosphate, a contention essentially based upon results of in vitro tests. This study strongly argues for in vivo testing of new fibrous materials before making definite conclusions about their biological activities...|$|E
40|$|Several {{cellular}} interactions {{have been}} identified as potentially important in fibrogenesis induced by mineral dusts. Evaluation of their relative importance in vivo remains a problem. Sealed diffusion chambers limited by Nuclepore membranes and implanted into mouse peritoneal cavities provide a means of assessing different stages of fibrogenesis by separating initiating mechanisms (dust-macrophage-lymphocyte combinations inside the chamber) from the target tissue. Fibrous reactions surrounding the chambers were quantitated by macroscopic and histological scoring, and by measurement of 14 C glycine incorporated at the reaction site. Using this model the <b>fibrogenicity</b> of Rhodesian A chrysotile asbestos, DQ 12 quartz and haematite were compared. Whereas asbestos-macrophage ratios of between 6. 6 and 900 micrograms/ 10 (6) mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) produced fibrosis, an equivalent response was obtained with 0. 05 micrograms silica/ 10 (6) MPM. Silica in amounts greater than this produced macrophage cytotoxicity without fibrogenesis. Haematite-macrophage combinations produced no significant fibrosis. It was confirmed that a direct dust-macrophage interaction forms the essential first step in fibrogenesis by both asbestos and silica and that the <b>fibrogenicity</b> is mediated by diffusible factor(s). Prior stimulation of host mice with Freund's complete adjuvant modified the fibrogenic response to some dust-cell combinations, suggesting an important role for host responses in determining the outcome of fibrogenic stimuli...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundNano-scaled {{cerium oxide}} (nCeO 2) {{is used in}} a variety of applications, {{including}} use as a fuel additive, catalyst, and polishing agent, yet potential adverse health effects associated with nCeO 2 exposure remain incompletely understood. Given the increasing utility and demand for engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) such as nCeO 2, 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 safety-by-design 22 ̆ 0 ac? approaches are currently being sought, meaning that the physicochemical properties (e. g., size and surface chemistry) of the ENMs are altered in an effort to maximize functionality while minimizing potential toxicity. In vivo studies have shown in a rat model that inhaled nCeO 2 deposited deep in the lung and induced fibrosis. However, little is known about how the physicochemical properties of nCeO 2, or the coating of the particles with a material such as amorphous silica (aSiO 2), may affect the bio-activity of these particles. Thus, we hypothesized that the physicochemical properties of nCeO 2 may explain its potential to induce fibrogenesis, and that a nano-thin aSiO 2 coating on nCeO 2 may counteract that effect. ResultsPrimary normal human lung fibroblasts were treated at occupationally relevant doses with nCeO 2 that was either left uncoated or was coated with aSiO 2 (amsCeO 2). Subsequently, fibroblasts were analyzed for known hallmarks of fibrogenesis, including cell proliferation and collagen production, as well as the formation of fibroblastic nodules. The results of this study are consistent with this hypothesis, as we found that nCeO 2 directly induced significant production of collagen I and increased cell proliferation in vitro, while amsCeO 2 did not. Furthermore, treatment of fibroblasts with nCeO 2, but not amsCeO 2, significantly induced the formation of fibroblastic nodules, a clear indicator of <b>fibrogenicity.</b> Such in vitro data is consistent with recent in vivo observations using the same nCeO 2 nanoparticles and relevant doses. This effect appeared to be mediated through TGF 2 signaling since chemical inhibition of the TGF 2 receptor abolished these responses. ConclusionsThese results indicate that differences in the physicochemical properties of nCeO 2 may alter the <b>fibrogenicity</b> of this material, thus highlighting the potential benefits of 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 safety-by-design 22 ̆ 0 ac? strategies. In addition, this study provides an efficient in vitro method for testing the <b>fibrogenicity</b> of ENMs that strongly correlates with in vivo findings. 2016 - 05 - 04 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 27142434 PMC 485584...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} mineral dusts were {{injected}} into the pleural cavities of mice {{in order to test}} their relative <b>fibrogenicity.</b> It was found that long fibre dust specimens produced widespread cellular granulomata which formed firm adhesions between the lungs, diaphragm and chest wall. These granulomata were gradually replaced by fibrous tissue and in old animals the dust was often found embedded in masses of acellular collagen. When the same mineral samples were more finely ground and sieved so that no long fibres remained in the dust, the resulting granulomata were much smaller and did not form adhesions. The small granulomata did, however, fibrose eventually and the dust was embedded in small nodules of collagen. Non-fibrous mineral rocks when finely ground and sieved also produced small non-adherent granulomata. The actual size of these granulomata depended on the number of cells attracted to the dust and this did vary with the different samples tested.

40|$|Numerous {{reports have}} shown that fibrous glass has the {{potential}} to cause fibrogenic and carcinogenic responses in test animals. The experiments producing significant response have, however, used unrealistic routes of exposure. The increased demand for fibrous glass for insulating purposes where respirable fibers may exist presents considerable con-cern for potential health problems. Therefore, a long-term inhalation study was con-ducted with F 344 rats and cynomolgus monkeys exposed in treatments characterized by fibers of varying geometry and m a s concentrations. A workweek type of exposure (7 hours/day, 5 days/week) was maintained for 18 months with monkeys and 21 months with rats, which were subsequently held to 80 % mortality.

40|$|Many of {{the mineral}} {{particles}} {{that are of}} concern in regard to lung toxicity are poorly soluble particles (PSPs). They include biopersistent mineral fibers and dusts containing crystalline silica. The preparation of well-defined test particles of respirable size range and their characterization are an essential step that may require more time and effort than the toxicity study itself. For toxicity studies with mineral particles, {{an investigation of the}} toxicokinetics is recommended. Such an investigation will yield information that will help to interpret the results if dust overload conditions occur. For mineral particles such as crystalline silica and mineral fibers, an important endpoint is their potential carcinogenicity. The following parameters are important for the design of chronic toxicity studies, and for the prediction of severe chronic effects: lung retention of inhaled materials for assessing the accumulation of particles, persistent inflammation in lungs, persistent proliferation of epithelial lung cells, progressive <b>fibrogenicity,</b> and genotoxicity in the lung cells. These endpoints should indicate whether the materials investigated are of concern in the health effects on exposed humans, and in the effects of the mineral particles for which chronic studies may be required.

40|$|The {{formation}} of {{reactive oxygen species}} resulting from the interaction of silica dust particles with red blood cell membranes was investigated; particularly, the effect of surface hydroxyl (silanol) group concentration on the rate of {{formation of}} such reactive oxygen species was investigated. The rate of formation was measured indirectly through the effect of catalase, a hemoprotein peroxidase, on silica-induced hemolysis. It {{was found that the}} addition of exogenous catalase to erythrocytes markedly reduces the hemolysis caused by silica particles. Furthermore, the amount of catalase required for deactivation of silica per unit area of particle surface is lower for fumed silica particles and calcined crystalline particles than for uncalcined, crystalline silica, suggesting a correlation between the concentration of OH groups at the silica particle surface and its potential for generation of H 2 O 2. The addition of albumin, a copper chelator, also decreases hemolysis. These results suggest that the hemolysis caused by silica particles is at least partly related to the formation of H 2 O 2 at the particle surface and its subsequent reaction with Cu+ ions. The relationship between the concentration of surface silanol groups on the silica surface and the amount of catalase required to decrease hemolysis may also provide a method for testing potential <b>fibrogenicity</b> of respirable dusts...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Long-term {{studies of}} {{respiratory}} function and lung morphology {{were carried out}} on control groups of guinea pigs and matched groups exposed by inhalation to asbestos dust. Animals were exposed to aerosols of chrysotile or amosite asbestos containing large numbers of short fibres, for either 9 or 18 days. Resistance and dynamic compliance of the guinea pig respiratory system were measured non-destructively, while the point counting technique {{was applied to the}} histological preparations. Under these exposure conditions the extent of pathological and functional changes were not related to differences in duration of exposure. Such changes were more marked, however, in animals exposed at eight rather than three months of age. The measurement of dynamic compliance provided the most sensitive assessment of the functional disturbances, which were more extensive following chrysotile exposure. Progressive peribronchiolar fibrosis developed about 40 weeks after chrysotile exposure at eight months of age, but not until about 70 weeks for animals exposed when three months old. No fibrotic reaction was seen during the 70 weeks of the amosite experiments. The relationships between pathological and functional changes throughout these experiments are discussed, and explanations for the apparent differences in <b>fibrogenicity</b> between chrysotile and amosite are suggested.

40|$|Given their {{extremely}} small size and light weight, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{can be readily}} inhaled by human lungs resulting in increased rates of pulmonary disorders, particularly fibrosis. Although the fibrogenic potential of CNTs is well established, {{there is a lack}} of consensus regarding the contribution of physicochemical attributes of CNTs on the underlying fibrotic outcome. We designed an experimentally validated in vitro fibroblast culture model aimed at investigating the effect of fiber length on single-walled CNT (SWCNT) -induced pulmonary fibrosis. The fibrogenic response to short and long SWCNTs was assessed via oxidative stress generation, collagen expression and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- 2) production as potential fibrosis biomarkers. Long SWCNTs were significantly more potent than short SWCNTs in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) response, collagen production and TGF- 2 release. Furthermore, our finding on the length-dependent in vitro fibrogenic response was validated by the in vivo lung fibrosis outcome, thus supporting the predictive value of the in vitro model. Our results also demonstrated the key role of ROS in SWCNT-induced collagen expression and TGF- 2 activation, indicating the potential mechanisms of length-dependent SWCNT-induced fibrosis. Together, our study provides new evidence for the role of fiber length in SWCNT-induced lung fibrosis and offers a rapid cell-based assay for <b>fibrogenicity</b> testing of nanomaterials with the ability to predict pulmonary fibrogenic response in vivo.

40|$|Dust dose and {{composition}} {{do not appear}} to account wholly for changes in the prevalence of coal workers ' pneumoconiosis in Europe. In certain coal pits high progression evidently occurred with relatively low dust exposure or vice versa, whereas progression in relation to dust levels might be variable. Exceptionally high quartz concentrations occur in coal mine dust when pneumoconiosis may progress with unusual rapidity. Under such circumstances lesions resembling silicotic nodules may be found, but with the customarily lower levels of quartz the pathological features assume the form characteristic of coal workers. Morphological changes in relation to dust content of human and animal lungs, as well as cellular behavior, have not accounted completely for the epidemiological findings. Considering all the pathological evidence helps explain the pathogenesis of pneumoconiosis and vagaries of progression. The origin of progressive massive fibrosis cannot be explained simply in tenns of dust burden or immunological features, and the role of an infective factor cannot be dismissed. Moreover, lipid secretion by alveolar epithelium introduces a new element that could affect the development of simple and complicated pneumoconiosis.

The nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cell is thought to play a similar role during repair of the bronchiolar epithelium. Recent evidence has suggested that epithelial cells may participate in aspects of the inflammatory response and regulation of fibroblast growth during pulmonary fibrosis through the production of and response to specific growth factors and cytokines. The cellular and molecular responses of epithelial cells and how they lead to the progression of events that defines the pulmonary parenchymal response to a class of particles is unclear. We used particles differing in size, chemical composition, and <b>fibrogenicity</b> in vivo and in vitro to elucidate early changes in proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokine and antioxidant gene expression in lung cells. Early increases in mRNA and protein for the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) - 1 f, IL- 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha have been observed in epithelial cells following exposure. These are accompanied by changes in specific epithelial genes including surfactant protein C and Clara cell secretory protein. The data indicate that effects on the epithelium are due to direct interactions with particles, not a result of macrophage-derived mediators, and suggest a more significant role in the overall pulmonary response than previously suspected.

40|$|Abstract-f-Coal fly ashes (CFA) {{are complex}} {{particles}} of a variable composition, which is mainly {{dependent on the}} combustion process, the source of coal and the precipitation technique. Toxic constituents in these particles {{are considered to be}} metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and silica. The purpose of this review was to study the in vitro and in vivo data on coal fly ash and relate the studied endpoints to the role of (crystalline) silica, considering its recent classification as a human carcinogen. For most of the effects coal mine dust was chosen as a reference, since it contains up to 10 % of crystalline silica (ot-quartz) and is well studied both in vivo and in vitro. Most studies on fly ash toxicity were not designed to elucidate the effect of its silica-content nor did they include coal mine dust as a reference. Taking this into account, both in vitro and in vivo experimental studies show lower toxicity, inflammatory potential and <b>fibrogenicity</b> of CFA compared to silica and coal mine dust. Although in vitro and in vivo studies suggest genotoxic effects of fly ash, the data are limited and do not clarify the role of silica. Epidemiological studies in fly ash exposed working populations have found no evidence for effects commonly seen in coal workers (pneumoconiosis, emphysema) with the exception of airway obstruction at high exposure. In conclusion, the available data suggest that the hazard of coal fly ash is not to be assessed by merely adding the hazards of individual components. A closer investigation of 'matrix ' effects on silica's toxicity in general seems an obligatory step in future risk assessment on fly ashes and other particles that incorporate silica as a component.

ResultsThe natural lung surfactant Survanta 2 was used to disperse single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) in a biological medium. At physiologically relevant concentrations, Survanta 2 produced well dispersed SWCNT without causing a cytotoxic or fibrogenic effect. In vitro studies show that Survanta 2 -dispersed SWCNT (SD-SWCNT) stimulated proliferation of lung epithelial cells at low doses (0. 04 - 0. 12 /ml or 0. 02 - 0. 06 /cm 2 exposed surface area) but had a suppressive effect at high doses. Non-dispersed SWCNT (ND-SWCNT) did not exhibit these effects, suggesting the importance of dispersion status of SWCNT on bioactivities. Studies using cultured human lung fibroblasts show that SD-SWCNT stimulated collagen production of the cells. This result is supported by a similar observation using Acetone/sonication dispersed SWCNT (AD-SWCNT), suggesting that Survanta 2 did not mask the bioactivity of SWCNT. Likewise, in vivo studies show that both SD-SWCNT and AD-SWCNT induced lung fibrosis in mice, whereas the dispersing agent Survanta 2 alone or Survanta 2 -dispersed control ultrafine carbon black had no effect. ConclusionsThe results indicate that Survanta 2 was effective in dispersing SWCNT in biological media without causing cytotoxic effects at the test concentrations used in this study. SD-SWCNT stimulated collagen production of lung fibroblasts in vitro and induced lung fibrosis in vivo. Similar results were observed with AD-SWCNT, supporting the conclusion that Survanta 2 did not mask the bioactivities of SWCNT and thus can be used as an effective dispersing agent. Since excessive collagen production is a hallmark of lung fibrosis, {{the results of this study}} suggest that the in vitro model using lung fibroblasts may be an effective and rapid screening tool for prediction of the fibrogenic potential of SWCNT in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Neste artigo revê-se o estado do conhecimento científico quanto aos efeitos da inalação de fibras de asbesto (amianto) na saúde humana e sua prevenção. Propõe-se a fundamentação científica do debate que se faz no Brasil, visando alterar a política governamental sobre a questão, de modo a priorizar a defesa da vida, da saúde e do meio-ambiente. No início, são discutidos aspectos tecnológicos e econômicos acerca do asbesto e, em especial, da crisotila. A seguir, explana-se a evolução do conhecimento científico internacional sobre os efeitos da inalação de fibras de asbesto na saúde. Após isso, descreve-se o conhecimento nacional acerca dos danos oriundos do amianto, concluindo-se que as doenças descritas no {{exterior}} constam de nossa literatura médica há tempos. Na seqüência, enfoca-se o debate sobre a nocividade do asbesto-crisotila, o qual aponta para a sua confirmação. Depois, expõem-se as respostas da comunidade internacional à questão e a mobilização pela proibição do asbesto. Por fim, estuda-se a inadequação da posição brasileira e explicita-se a necessidade de revisão urgente. This {{paper is}} a state-of-the-art review {{of scientific knowledge}} on both {{the health effects of}} asbestos fiber inhalation and possibilities for safe and sustainable prevention, from an ethical, political, and technological point of view. The author provides scientific background and arguments from the ongoing discussion in Brazil concerning the need to redefine current asbestos policy, in order to establish a more advanced and appropriate policy whose priority is the protection of life, human health, and the environment. The first part deals with several technological and economic aspects of asbestos-chrysotile. In the second part, the author presents and discusses a bibliographic review of the construction of scientific knowledge on the health effects of asbestos fibers, first within an international perspective, and then (in the third part), from a Brazilian view. The fourth part analyzes the current debate on the <b>fibrogenicity</b> and carcinogenicity of asbestos-chrysotile. Some current responses from the international community towards the asbestos-chrysotile ban are also discussed. Finally, the author discusses the historical inadequacy of Brazilian asbestos policy and the urgent need to revise it to include a ban on asbestos-chrysotile in this country...|$|E
40|$|After {{long-term}} asbestos inhalation, {{the lung}} tissue burden {{is much less}} for chrysotile (CHRY) than for crocidolite (CRO) exposure. Nonetheless CHRY {{does not appear to}} be less fibrogenic. To study mechanisms responsible for the low retention of CHRY and the relationships with fibrogenesis, 15 sheep received a single intratracheal injection of either CHRY or CRO. Exposures in 100 ml saline consisted of 100 mg of 1 -micron latex beads for the five control sheep, 100 mg UICC CRO fibres for the five CRO sheep and 100 mg UICC B CHRY fibres for the five CHRY sheep. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was carried out at months 2, 4, 6 and 8 after exposure and necropsy at month 8. BAL and tissue samples were analysed for fibres by transmission electron microscopy. At month 2, mass concentration in BAL was 108 +/- 30 ng/ml for CRO and 0. 6 +/- 0. 1 ng/ml for CHRY. BAL CRO decreased afterward but BAL CHRY did not. The mass concentration in the lung at month 8 was 40. 6 +/- 8. 7 ng/mg dry tissue for CRO and 11. 5 +/- 7. 0 ng/mg for CHRY. BAL fibrogenic activity at month 8 assessed by macrophage fibronectin production was less than 0. 2 ng/ 10 (6) cells/ 24 h in control sheep, 5 +/- 2 in CRO sheep and 11 +/- 2 in CHRY sheep (P less than 0. 05 CRO vs CHRY). Histologic score of tissue injury fibrosis was 0 in control sheep, 1. 9 +/- 0. 3 in CRO sheep and 2. 8 +/- 0. 1 in CHRY sheep (P less than 0. 05). At necropsy, the number size distribution of fibres per microgram of tissue from the (CRO) /(CHRY) sheep was respectively: (127 +/- 54) /(15 +/- 14) for fibres less than 5 microns, (18 +/- 17) /(32 +/- 14) for fibres greater than 5 microns, (1. 6 +/- 8) /(7 +/- 13) for fibres greater than 20 microns. This study documented that the low pulmonary retention of CHRY was largely related to the faster alveolar clearance rate of CHRY mass. <b>Fibrogenicity</b> of CHRY remained higher and appeared to be related at least in part to the preferential retention of long and very long CHRY fibres...|$|E
