Hydraulically powered control surfaces help to overcome these limitations. With hydraulic flight control systems, the aircraft's size and performance are limited by economics rather than a pilot's muscular strength.

25|$|Funk {{uses the}} same richly-coloured {{extended}} chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. However, unlike bebop jazz, with its complex, rapid-fire chord changes, funk virtually abandoned chord changes, creating static single chord vamps with melodo-harmonic movement and a complex, driving rhythmic <b>feel.</b> <b>Some</b> {{of the best known}} and most skilful soloists in funk have jazz backgrounds. Trombonist Fred Wesley and saxophonist Pee Wee Ellis and Maceo Parker are among the most notable musicians in the funk music genre, with both of them working with James Brown, George Clinton and Prince.|$|E
25|$|To begin, affective {{emotions}} {{and the effect}} infidelity has on affective jealousy. Both {{men and women alike}} <b>feel</b> <b>some</b> kind of jealousy when they suspect their significant other is being unfaithful (Johnson, 2017). If some individual suspects {{that he or she is}} being cheated on they begin to question their partners actions and may possibly act in more frustrated ways towards them than they normally would. For example, they may ask more questions about the whereabouts of their partner or get upset more frequently and more often whenever they feel that their partner is lying or going out without them. Bursts of frustration without thinking it through or realizing why an individual is having those emotions can be an affective response in a difficult situation. The affective use of jealousy in a seemingly unfaithful relationship is caused by the accusing partner anticipating the infidelity from the other.|$|E

The composer sampled several instruments from around the world to give the score a more ethnic, international <b>feel.</b> <b>Some</b> episodes feature the score taking different styles.

Hilson commented she wanted to address the haters, and all the media speculation about the remarks was something they did not intend to accomplish with the song. She also addressed that the release of the song was not an intentional leak, stating most remixes are meant to be done when a record is hot, and although admitting that while [...] "Turnin Me On" [...] was not [...] "a number one record", the remix was done three months prior.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Viacom, which owned Paramount Pictures, {{separated}} from CBS Corporation, which retained Paramount's television properties, including {{ownership of the}} Star Trek brand. Gail Berman, then president of Paramount, convinced CBS' chief executive, Leslie Moonves, to allow them eighteen months {{to develop a new}} Star Trek film, otherwise Paramount would lose the film rights. Berman approached [...] writers Orci and Kurtzman for ideas on the new film, and after the film had completed shooting she asked their director, Abrams, to produce it. Abrams, Orci and Kurtzman, plus producers Damon Lindelof and Bryan Burk, felt the franchise had explored enough of what took place after the series, Orci and Lindelof consider themselves trekkies, and <b>feel</b> <b>some</b> of the Star Trek novels have canonical value, although Roddenberry never considered the novels to be canon. Kurtzman is a casual fan, while Burk was not. Abrams' company, Bad Robot Productions produced the film with Paramount, marking the first time another company had financed a Star Trek film. Bill Todman, Jr.'s Level 1 Entertainment also co-produced the film, but, during 2008, Spyglass Entertainment replaced them as financial partner.|$|E

[...] The key for Hazlitt is the innate human [...] "love of power". This love of power is not necessarily expressed by a will to dominate others physically; but {{there is at least}} the tendency to side with power in the imagination, to be swayed and carried away emotionally by the power of poetic language. Hazlitt's own worship of Napoleon, it was later observed, could be taken as an example of this tendency.|$|E

[...] In Italy, Federico Fellini in an interview declared the director [...] "the greatest living example of all that an author of the cinema should be"âdespite admitting to having seen only one of his films, Seven Samurai. In France, Roman Polanski in 1965 cited Kurosawa {{as one of his}} three favorite filmmakers (with Fellini and Orson Welles), singling out Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood and The Hidden Fortress for praise. The Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci considered the Japanese master's influence to be seminal: [...] "Kurosawa's movies and La Dolce Vita of Fellini are the things that pushed me, sucked me into being a film director." [...] German New Wave director Werner Herzog has cited Kurosawa as one of his greatest influences: [...] "Of the filmmakers with whom I <b>feel</b> <b>some</b> kinship, Griffith...

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{producer}} Eric Buchman, while filmmaker Michael Grossman directed it. Buchman explained how his main concept for the episode was to describe O'Malley's grieving {{in a different way}} than depicted for Stevens, but in a manner that would be both bothering to her and painful for his partner, Torres. However, he stated that Torres' emotional state during the mourning was also significant to the episode: [...] "We wanted Callie to <b>feel</b> <b>some</b> remorse. She finally got George, but not in the way she wanted. She's gotten his body, but the underlying relationship isn't there anymore." [...] Buchman disclosed that one of the story lines he had originally intended to include in the scrip was Yang and Burke's cold relationship being [...] "kept alive" [...] by having silent sex, which ultimately did not occur, due to being looked upon as [...] "boring, neither dramatic, nor comedic", and also as not being descriptive of the character's feelings. The story line involving the four attending physicians fighting for the title of chief of surgery, was described by Buchman as a comic relief, used to emphasize a childish side of the characters' personalities which had not been previously developed. In addition, Buchman described Webber's retirement as an attempt to reconcile with his estranged wife, but leads to emotional devastation at the realization that she had moved on with a different man.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} {{deviation of}} the film's plot from history {{is that there}} is scant evidence in real life Austen and Lefroy's relationship went beyond acquaintance. Rather, all that is known of them together is that they danced at three Christmas balls before Tom returned to school and that Jane was [...] "too proud" [...] to ask his aunt about him two years later. In the latter years of Tom Lefroy's life, he was questioned about his relationship with Jane Austen by his nephew, and admitted to having loved Jane Austen, but stated that it was a [...] "boyish love". As is written in a letter sent from T.E.P. Lefroy to James Edward Austen Leigh in 1870,My late venerable uncle ... said in so many words that {{he was in love with}} her, although he qualified his confession by saying it was a boyish love. As this occurred in a friendly & private conversation, I <b>feel</b> <b>some</b> doubt whether I ought to make it public.Lori Smith, author of The Jane Austen Guide to Life, opined that:No doubt this relationship and her [...] repartee with Tom fueled her writing. Whether it was [...] "her greatest inspiration" [...] as the trailers for Becoming Jane claim, well, that's debatable. But I'm sure it provided as spark.However, contrary to the film's story line, Jane had attempted her first full-length novel before she met Tom and had already read The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling before meeting him. In a cut scene from the movie, it is clear that she is reading the novel for the second time, but in the theatrical release without that scene, it appears he introduces her to it.|$|E
500|$|Tom Hall {{announced}} that Ananchronox would feature a [...] "turbulent {{story with a}} roller coaster of emotion", and promised it would bring personality and humor to the role-playing genre. Hall aimed to make an emotionally gripping, cinematic experience from the beginning: [...] "I want this game to answer the question, 'Can a computer make you cry?' I {{want to make the}} characters so warm and friendly and lovable and identifiable... I want to start them off in fun situations, but as the game goes on, I want the atmosphere to get darker and darker. Friends betray the lead character, other friends die, and you will <b>feel</b> <b>some</b> of what they feel because you have been with these people for 50 hours, and in a sense, lived part of their lives with them." [...] Hall remarked that the characters were facets of his childhood. He later compared the name Anachronox (meaning poison from the past) and the internal struggles of each character, caused by turbulent events in their pasts and [...] "psychic poison." [...] Hall aimed to feature high-quality direction and camera-work in Anachronox, reminiscent of epic cinematic themes in role-playing video games like the Final Fantasy franchise. Hall enlisted producer Jake Hughes to direct cut scenes; Hughes had previously worked on several short independent films. Developers used real-time game cutscenes instead of live-action cinematics to avoid [...] " [...] players out of the game." [...] Hall remarked, [...] "All these games switch to cutscenes that look five hundred times better than the game. The secret is not to let the cutscenes kick the game's ass." ...|$|E
