5|$|Unlike {{most other}} self-extracting revolvers (such as the Webley service revolvers or the Smith & Wesson No. 3 Revolver), the Enfield Mk I/Mk II was {{complicated}} to unload, having an Owen Jones selective extraction/ejection system {{which was supposed}} to allow the firer to eject spent cartridges, whilst retaining live rounds in the cylinder. The Enfield Mk I/Mk II had a hinged frame, and when the barrel was unlatched, the cylinder would move forward, operating the extraction system and allowing the spent cartridges to simply fall out. The idea was that the cylinder moved forward <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> to permit fired cases to be completely extracted (and ejected by gravity), but not <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> to permit live cartridges (i.e., those with projectiles still present, and thus longer in overall length) from being removed in the same manner.|$|E

5|$|Across North America during La Niña, {{increased}} precipitation is diverted {{into the}} Pacific Northwest {{due to a}} more northerly storm track and jet stream.

Snowfall is above normal across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the jet stream is stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{somewhat}} reddish Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white. Pluto's reddish color {{is thought to}} be due to deposits of tholins on its surface, and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> from the Sun that methane can condense onto its surface even where the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.|$|E

A company called M4 was to have co-developed them alongside Lionhead, but Electronic Arts {{were not interested in}} the Game Boy versions.

5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E
5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his {{apartment}}.
