50|$|A {{helicopter}} swashplate {{is a pair}} of plates, one rotating and one fixed, {{that are}} centered on the main rotor shaft. The rotating plate is linked to the rotor head, and the <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> is linked to the operator controls. Displacement of the alignment of the <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> is transferred to the rotating plate, where it becomes reciprocal motion of the rotor blade linkages. This type of pitch control, known as cyclic pitch, allows the helicopter rotor to provide selective lift in any direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrostatic}} pickup {{consists of}} a capacitor with one stationary plate and one moving plate. The moving plate is typically a steel or brass reed, anchored {{at one end and}} free to vibrate at the other end. Another <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> is suspended near the vibrating reed, but is electrically insulated.A high voltage is applied between the stationary and moving plates to produce an electric field. The motion of the moving plate induces a varying current through the capacitor formed by the reed and the <b>fixed</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{electrostatic}} pickup {{used in the}} Hohner Pianet N electric piano has a <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> {{mounted at}} a 90 degree angle to the reed, while the fixed plates used in Wurlitzer electrostatic organs are parallel to the reed. The position of the <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> in the Pianet is such that the capacitance changes most dramatically when the reed is in the upper portion of its travel. The result is a large second-harmonic content in the resulting signal, similar to that produced by a fuzz box distortion pedal.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the advent}} of modern winemaking, most presses were basket presses made of wood and {{operated}} manually. Basket presses are composed of a cylinder of wooden slats {{on top of a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>plate,</b> with a moveable plate that can be forced downward (usually by a central ratcheting threaded screw.) The press operator would load the grapes or pomace into the wooden cylinder, put the top plate in place and lower it until juice flowed from the wooden slats. As the juice flow decreased, the plate was ratcheted down again. This process continued until the press operator determined that the quality of the pressed juice or wine was below standard, or all liquids had been pressed. Since the early 1990s, modern mechanical basket presses have been revived through higher-end producers seeking to replicate the gentle pressing of the historical basket presses. Because basket presses have a relatively compact design, the press cake offers a relatively longer pathway for the juice to travel before leaving the press. It is believed by advocates of basket presses that this relatively long pathway through the grape or pomace cake serves as a filter to solids that would otherwise affect the quality of the press juice.|$|E
5000|$|Initially known as, [...] "The Video Disc" [...] or the Teldec Television Disc, TeD (Television Electronic Disc) {{was first}} {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference in Berlin on June 24, 1970. It was developed by a team from two German companies: AEG-Telefunken and Teldec. Program information was stored in the form of ridges in the surface of a thin, flexible foil disc, which was claimed to be sufficiently robust to withstand being played 1,000 times. The main technological breakthrough was the vertical recording method that reduced the track pitch to 0.007 mm, and increased the rotation speed to 1,500 rpm, making it possible to record 130-150 grooves per millimeter, compared with the typical 10-13 grooves on an audio disc. This increased the available bandwidth from around 15 kHz to 3 MHz. The tracks were read by a pressure pick-up, which translated the surface of the ridges, via a piezo-electric crystal, into an electrical signal.Tracking was controlled not by the pick-up resting within the walls of a groove, but by a mechanical coupling on which the pick-up mounting is supported. There was no turntable. The rotation of the disc at 1,500 rpm created a thin cushion of air between the disc and a <b>fixed</b> <b>plate.</b> Vertical movement of the disc was kept to within 0.05mm. Eight-inch discs could store five minutes of programming, twelve-inch discs about 7½ minutes.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringDanny H. RogersCenter pivot {{irrigation}} systems {{are used in}} crop production across the state of Kansas. The American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) standard on uniformity testing of a center pivot system calls for collectors {{to be used to}} measure the water depth emitted by the irrigation system. The standard was designed without specially considering the low pressure sprinklers now commonly used on center pivot systems; the recommended collectors may not accurately measure the applied depth from these sprinklers. The collector size effect on measured water depth and measured depth variability was studied for spinning plate, <b>fixed</b> <b>plate,</b> and wobbling plate sprinkler systems. Five different collector sizes (C 2 (5. 5 cm), C 4 (10. 0 cm), C 6 (14. 8 cm), C 8 (20. 0 cm), and C 10 (27. 4 cm)) were studied using four 5 x 5 Latin squares. Each collector’s water depth was measured and statistically analyzed. Two analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of the collector size effect were reported. Past experimental results were compared to this experiment’s results. The ANOVA for the measured water depth reported no collector size effect for the spinning plate and wobbling plate systems. The ANOVA of the variability of measured depths showed significant differences between collector sizes for the spinning plate system but not for the wobbling plate system. Previous studies of spinning plate and wobbling plate systems reported acceptable variability for all collector sizes. Although some collector sizes measured significantly different mean depths, the numerical difference in mean depths was small. Any studied collector size could be used to measure the water depth of wobbling plate systems, but the C 4 collector is ideal. C 4 and C 6 collectors are ideal for measuring spinning plate systems. Significant differences between measured depths were reported for the <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> system. The C 10 measured significantly lower water depths than all other collectors, and the C 4 collector measured lower depths than the C 2 and C 8 collectors. The variability of mean depths was similar and high for all collector sizes. Previous experiments also indicated that different collector sizes measured different depths and had high variability of depth measurements for the <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> sprinkler systems. The distinct stream pattern provides a challenge for accurately measuring the water depth with these collector sizes; other methods of measuring uniformity should be considered for <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> sprinklers...|$|E
