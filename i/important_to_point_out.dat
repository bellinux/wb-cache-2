25|$|Before {{discussing}} Petty's economic theories, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> two crucial {{influences in}} his life. The first is Thomas Hobbes, for whom Petty acted as personal secretary. According to Hobbes, theory should {{set out the}} rational requirements for 'civil peace and material plenty'. As Hobbes had centred on peace, Petty chose prosperity.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{that the}} {{secondary}} social sharing {{is not limited}} to negative emotional episodes, but instead can occur after positive emotional episodes as well. In one study, 83% of the participants reported some degree of secondary social sharing in response to both positive and negative emotional situation, with no differences found between these two valences. However, there were some qualitative differences between secondary sharing for each: for positive emotional episodes, secondary social sharing was initiated faster and with a higher number of repetitions and targets than for negatives emotional episodes.|$|E
25|$|Before {{considering}} {{the factors that}} motivate the performance paradox, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that characteristics known as comparability and variability differentiate good performance measures from bad ones. Comparability {{is defined as the}} potential to utilize a performance measure across different settings to horizontally compare performance. Variability is essential because it ensures that evaluations can be recorded on an outcome scale that is extended enough to vertically compare different levels of performance. Within organizations, these two properties are impacted by the use of several weakly correlated performance measures through a mechanism termed the running down process.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{formalism}} {{is defined}} as the science of mind and corresponds to the behavior of animal objects. Human psychology {{is considered to be a}} unique subset of psychological formalism that deals with human behavior at the level of the individual. Because human behavior is immersed in the larger socio-cultural context (level four in the ToK System), human psychology is considered a hybrid discipline that merges the pure science of psychology with the social sciences. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that there are other disciplines the ToK System would classify as “hybrids.” Molecular genetics, for example, is a hybrid between chemistry and biology and neuroscience is a hybrid between biology and psychology. As with Henriques' proposed conception of human psychology, both of these disciplines adopt an object level perspective (molecular and cellular, respectively) on phenomena that simultaneously exist as part of meta-level system processes (life and mind, respectively).|$|E
50|$|In mirror {{electron}} microscopy, electrons are slowed in the retarding {{field of}} the condenser lens to the limit of the instrument and thus, only allowed {{to interact with the}} “near-surface” region of the sample. It is very complicated to understand the exact contrast variations come from, but the <b>important</b> things <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> here are that height variations at the surface of the region change the properties of the retarding field, therefore influencing the reflected (specular) beam. No LEED pattern is formed, because no scattering events have taken place, and therefore, reflected intensity is high.|$|R
5000|$|It {{would be}} very <b>important</b> for us <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> here {{that there is a}} clear {{contrast}} between the long ridge line, from Balengou to Bangoulap, to the immediate area of the Bazou hills with steep slopes or the picturesque sites occupied by our ancestors who arrived A little late from the Tikar plain.|$|R

25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that kanto had now {{moved from}} the stage to the {{recording}} studio. While the subjects {{dealt with in the}} lyrics were stili the same old quarreis between men and women, mixed in with satirical takes on fashion and current events, the songs were being written with the 78 rpm phonograph in mind. So much so that every record label hired their own kanto composers—and rather famous ones at that. With Columbia at the fore, record labels commissioned kanto from Kaptanzade Ali Rıza Bey, Refik Fersan, Dramalı Hasan, Sadettin Kaynak, Cümbüş Mehmet and Mildan Niyazi Bey. The makams were the same but the instrumentation had changed. Kanto were now accompanied by cümbüş (a fretlees banjo like instrument) the ud (a fretless) lute, and calpara (castenets). Foxtrot, Charleston and rumba rhythms dominated. The tunes were being written and sung more tor listening than tor dancing. Female soloists include Makbule Enver, Mahmure, and Neriman; Beşiktaşlı Kemal Senman was the most sought after male singer for duets.|$|E
25|$|During the war the Ottomans {{managed to}} take Sisak. On 24 August 1593 the Ottomans used {{the absence of a}} large army near Sisak, which was defended by 100 soldiers. With strong cannon fire they managed to break through the walls and on 30 August the {{fortress}} surrendered. Sisak was liberated on 11 August 1594, when the Ottoman garrison fled and set the fortress on fire. The Long War ended with the Peace of Zsitvatorok on 11 November 1606, marking the first sign of the suppression of Ottoman expansion into Central Europe and stabilization of the frontier for half a century. Inner Austria with the duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola remained free from Ottoman control. Croatia was also able to maintain its independence from further Ottoman incursions and made some territorial gains following the peace treaty, such as Petrinja, Moslavina and Čazma. It is also <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that after this first great Ottoman defeat in northwestern Balkans, the Orthodox Christian subjects of the empire, particularly Serbs and Vlachs (who had been loyal and military useful) began then to lose faith in their Muslim masters, and began passing slowly over to the Habsburg side by emigrating from Ottoman-controlled lands to those of the Habsburgs, or even revolting against the Ottomans in their own territory (Uprising in Banat).|$|E
500|$|The {{benefits}} {{for children to}} maintain relationships with both parents have been repeatedly shown in research. [...] Children in joint custody arrangements often report greater levels of satisfaction with the division of time between their parents and children are also less likely to feel torn between their parents when compared with children who are in sole custody arrangements. In addition, children in joint custody arrangements report feeling closer to both parents than children in sole custody arrangements. Joint custody arrangements also appear to benefit the parents. Not only do parents in joint custody arrangements report lower levels of conflict with one another, when compared to those in sole custody arrangements, but joint custody is frequently related to more positive relationships, effective parenting, and lower inter-parental conflict; key factors that ensure a child’s well-being following divorce. However, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that children are {{far less likely to}} do well with joint custody and sole custody arrangements when their parents used them as pawns or when they consistently witness their parents' frequent, intense, and ongoing conflict.|$|E

It's {{our duty to}} look at any crime that comes to us[...] [...] After the regime has fallen, {{we believe that the}} Muslim majority in Syria will ask for an Islamic state. Of course, it's very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that some say the Islamic Sharia will cut off people's hands and heads, but it only applies to criminals. And to start off by killing, crucifying etc. That is not correct at all." [...] In response to being asked what the difference between the Islamic Front's and ISIL's version of sharia would be, he said, [...] "One of their mistakes is before the regime has fallen, and before they've established what in Sharia is called Tamkeen , they started applying Sharia, thinking God gave them permission to control the land and establish a Caliphate.

2500|$|In Hungary American {{comic book}} {{publishing}} {{dates back to}} the late eighties (see The last decade of communist Hungary section in history chapter), but until the middle of {{the first decade of the}} new millennium these comics were limited to the superhero genre (Batman, Superman, Spider-man, X-men, etc.), children's (well known titles from the TV screen: Tom and Jerry, Disney characters, etc.), humor comics (Garfield). Parallel to the Hungarian comics market moving to the bookstores, publishers put more emphasis on graphic novels. Today Dark Horse Comics and Vertigo titles are just as common editorial picks as DC and Marvel titles. Many groundbreaking, cult comics, graphic novels have their Hungarian edition (i.e. Sandman, , Sin City, Watchmen, Understanding Comics, Maus, etc.) In 2006 31.3% of the comics published for the bookstore market were of American origin (claiming the highest portion), in 2009, despite the fact that the number of American comics grew by 80%, the portion of the total numbers released for the bookstore market decreased to 20.9%. In connection with American comics in Hungary it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> that more than half of the comics on the newsstand market are of American origin. A large portion of these are magazines dedicated to popular cartoon series (Tom and Jerry, Cartoon Network magazine, Sponge Bob, Scooby Doo, etc.) ...|$|E
30|$|The {{preservation}} {{of quality of}} life is the second major goal in the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer. The concept of an oncology group practice makes it possible to treat patients close to residence at a high professional level. It seems <b>important</b> <b>to</b> us <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> in this connection the continuity and constancy of care of patients and their relatives by the oncology team. In an own analysis we found a mean psychosocial distress level of only 5.2 for patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in our practice (Mergenthaler et al. 2011). This value was determined in a cross-sectional survey using the NCCN Distress Thermometer. Another important factor for holistic care is in our opinion the double qualification as medical oncologist and palliative care physician since throughout the course of the disease, with varying intensity, always palliative care aspects come to the fore.|$|R
40|$|THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE, {{as these}} words are {{commonly}} used, is fairly clear and quite <b>important.</b> We wish <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> however, that {{the importance of}} this distinction becomes very substantially greater when we understand it as <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> a different distinctionâ€”that between two levels of knowledge itself.

60|$|As bearing {{upon this}} {{question}} it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the harmony which exists, between {{the line of}} separation of the human races of the Archipelago {{and that of the}} animal productions of the same country, which I have already so fully explained and illustrated. The dividing lines do not, it is true, exactly agree; but I think it is a remarkable fact, and something more than a mere coincidence, that they should traverse the same district and approach each other so closely as they do. If, however, I am right in my supposition that the region where the dividing line of the Indo-Malayan and Austro-Malayan regions of zoology can now be drawn, was formerly occupied by a much wider sea than at present, and if man existed on the earth at that period, we shall see good reason why the races inhabiting the Asiatic and Pacific areas should now meet and partially intermingle in the vicinity of that dividing line.|$|E
6000|$|However, let us leave what {{is really}} a very sordid side of the subject, {{and return to the}} {{question}} of popular control in the matter of Art, by which I mean Public Opinion dictating to the artist the form which he is to use, the mode in which he is to use it, and the materials with which he is to work. I have pointed out that the arts which have escaped best in England are the arts in which the public have not been interested. They are, however, interested in the drama, and as a certain advance has been made in the drama within the last ten or fifteen years, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that this advance is entirely due to a few individual artists refusing to accept the popular want of taste as their standard, and refusing to regard Art as a mere matter of demand and supply. With his marvellous and vivid personality, with a style that has really a true colour-element in it, with his extraordinary power, not over mere mimicry but over imaginative and intellectual creation, Mr Irving, had his sole object been to give the public what they wanted, could have produced the commonest plays in the commonest manner, and made as much success and money as a man could possibly desire. But his object was not that. His object was to realise his own perfection as an artist, under certain conditions, and in certain forms of Art. At first he appealed to the few: now he has educated the many. He has created in the public both taste and temperament. The public appreciate his artistic success immensely. I often wonder, however, whether the public understand that that success is entirely {{due to the fact that}} he did not accept their standard, but realised his own. With their standard the Lyceum would have been a sort of second-rate booth, as some of the popular theatres in London are at present. Whether they understand it or not the fact however remains, that taste and temperament have, to a certain extent been created in the public, and that the public is capable of developing these qualities. The problem then is, why do not the public become more civilised? They have the capacity. What stops them? ...|$|E
50|$|The basic {{strengths}} of a Real-Time Delphi study are its efficiency and applicability to all Delphi topics (i.e. common problem sets, decision making issues, cross impact studies, etc.). Figure 2 illustrates {{that the process}} of a Real-Time Delphi differs. <b>Important</b> is <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that the number of interventions of the facilitator needed during the response phases (i.e. after opening the online tool) are usually less. Having developed the online tool in advance, the intermediate analysis done by the facilitator of the study is rather uncomplicated in comparison to the Conventional Delphi. The overall shortened time period needed to conduct a real-time study underlines that the approach can be regarded as generally more efficient.|$|R
40|$|Quack benediction {{has been}} used in Europe since the middle ages to treat lots of illness. In Brazil the bezendores {{appeared}} during the XVII century and interpretation of their knowledge, traditional use and management of plant resources are commonly addressed in ethnobotanical studies. Braziliam bezendores prescribe plants that can be used as medicine or as an amulet for personal protection. This use of plant material are present in the national popular culture. The present study was carried out at the municipality of Juruena, in Mato Grosso state, and it aimed to understand the importance of benzedeiras, to identify the plants used by them and how they are prescribed and manipulated. To reach the objectives we used techniques of participant-observation, semi-structured interviews and intentional samples. Additionally botanical material were collected and is deposited in the UFMT Herbarium. Four benzedeiras were interviewed between Septembrer/ 2002 and November of 2003 and they revealed an expressive botanical knowledge relating to quack benediction. They can benzer, prepare and prescribe teas, bottle preparative, medicinal baths and unguents. The illness cited by the benzedeiras was grouped as physical (for example, toothache, bellyache), and spiritual. A total of 87 ethno-species was mentioned arranged in 31 botanical families and between them it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> erva-de-Santa-Maria (Chenopodium ambrosioides L.), chapéu-de-couro (Echinodorus macrophyllus Miq.), quina-do-mato (Strychnos sp.), ipê-roxo (Tabebuia heptaphylla (Vell.) Toledo), arruda (Ruta graveolens L.), guiné (Petiveria alliacea L.), comigo-ninguém-pode (Dieffenbachia picta L.).

30|$|An <b>important</b> aspect <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> is {{that the}} {{transformation}} matrix W is calculated only once with the highest transmit power, after which {{it can be used}} with all transmit powers {{to reduce the number of}} basis functions. Namely, since the strengths of the nonlinearities are directly proportional to the transmit power, the SI terms that are negligibly weak with the highest transmit power are at least as weak with the lower transmit powers, which means that the same SI terms can be omitted also then. This is also proven by the waveform simulations, the results of which will be discussed in Section 4. However, should the SI channel change drastically at any point, then the matrix W must be recalculated to ensure that no significant memory taps are neglected.|$|R
