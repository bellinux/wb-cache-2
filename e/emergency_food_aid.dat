25|$|USAID {{has been}} Sudan's largest food aid donor since 2004. USAID {{provides}} an annual $30million for a multi-year food aid development program {{as well as}} almost $680million in <b>emergency</b> <b>food</b> <b>aid.</b> Darfur, displaced peoples and returnees, basic services, and food security are USAID's priorities.|$|E
25|$|The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, {{as primary}} holders of {{developing}} countries' debt, attach structural adjustment conditionalities {{in return for}} loans which are generally geared toward loan repayment with austerity measures such as the elimination of state subsidies and the privatization of state services. For example, the World Bank presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for fertilizer even while many farmers cannot afford them at market prices. In Malawi, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need <b>emergency</b> <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> but after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007 as Malawi became a major food exporter. A major proportion of aid from donor nations is tied, mandating that a receiving nation spend on products and expertise originating only from the donor country. US law requires food aid be spent on buying food at home, instead of where the hungry live, and, as a result, half of what is spent is used on transport.|$|E

2500|$|The FAO has {{proposed}} a [...] "twin track" [...] approach to fight food insecurity that combines sustainable development and short-term hunger relief. Development approaches include investing in rural markets and rural infrastructure. In general, the FAO proposes {{the use of public}} policies and programs that promote long-term economic growth that will benefit the poor. To obtain short-term food security, vouchers for seeds, fertilizer, or access to services could promote agricultural production. The use of conditional or unconditional food or cash transfers was another approach the FAO noted. Conditional transfers could include school feeding programs, while unconditional transfers could include general food distribution, <b>emergency</b> <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> or cash transfers. A third approach is the use of subsidies as safety nets to increase the purchasing power of households. The FAO stated that [...] "approaches should be human rights-based, target the poor, promote gender equality, enhance long-term resilience and allow sustainable graduation out of poverty." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{extensive}} {{literature on}} community {{participation in the}} targeting and management of humanitarian food assistance suggests that participatory approaches work best in slow-onset emergencies with no conflict or displacement. Yet the policies of many agencies [...] and compliance with Sphere minimum standards [...] require that the recipient community participate in decisions about the assistance they receive including targeting, regardless {{of the causes of}} the emergency. This paper analyzes current practice in the targeting and management of humanitarian food assistance in complex emergencies, the constraints to recipient communities' participation, and the possibilities for participatory approaches to improve targeting. Access and security considerations, limited staff time and capacity, and other constraints have long meant that the actual oversight of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> distributions in complex emergencies is left in the hands of local leaders at the village or camp level. Introduced institutions include Food Relief Committees, or other specially-organized bodies to deal with targeting and distribution questions. Differences in the accountability and legitimacy of these leaders and committees, together with post-distribution dynamics over which agencies have little control, account for much of the way in food assistance is actually distributed and utilized. But much of the process of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> targeting remains opaque to recipients, who are often not aware of their entitlements or the process of determining who is entitled. The paper concludes with a number of practical suggestions to improve participation in targeting in complex <b>emergencies.</b> <b>Food</b> <b>aid</b> Complex <b>emergencies</b> Community-based targeting Participation Relief committees Governance...|$|R

2500|$|The {{effort to}} bring modern {{agricultural}} techniques found in the West, such as nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides, to Asia, called the Green Revolution, resulted in decreases in malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing infrastructure and institutions that {{are in short supply}} in Africa, such as a system of roads or public seed companies that made seeds available. Investments in agriculture, such as subsidized fertilizers and seeds, increases food harvest and reduces food prices. For example, in the case of Malawi, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need <b>emergency</b> <b>food</b> <b>aid.</b> However, after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced against World Bank strictures, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests as production leaped to 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005, making Malawi a major food exporter. This lowered food prices and increased wages for farm workers. Such investments in agriculture are still needed in other African countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country {{has one of the highest}} [...] prevalence of malnutrition even though it is blessed with great agricultural potential John Ulimwengu explains in his article for D+C. Proponents for investing in agriculture include Jeffrey Sachs, who has championed the idea that wealthy countries should invest in fertilizer and seed for Africa’s farmers.|$|E
