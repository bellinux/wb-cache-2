5|$|Adam {{was created}} during {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies original pitch to the BBC {{as part of}} his plans to revive Doctor Who for the channel. Though established early in the series' planning, Adam was always intended to be a short-term character. Though reviewers generally reacted negatively to the character, Adam's role as a <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> the stock companion figure has been praised alongside the moral lessons of his departure.|$|E
5|$|In Mark, {{the disciples}} play hardly any role {{other than a}} {{negative}} one. While others sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, his disciples are puzzled and doubtful. They serve as a <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> Jesus and to other characters. The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.|$|E

5|$|Gaara {{was created}} a <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> the series' eponymous character, Naruto Uzumaki, {{as the two}} were born through similar circumstances, but develop vastly {{different}} personalities due to a troubled upbringing. His designs and name underwent {{major changes in the}} making of his final one which also was modified in later arcs to give Gaara a design that is easier to draw. In the Japanese version of the series, Gaara is voiced by Akira Ishida while Liam O'Brien replaces him in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} Test at Lord's Collingwood succumbed to a loose first-innings dismissal, {{chipping}} part-time spinner Michael Clarke to mid-on for 16 (and earning {{the ire of}} his captain Andrew Strauss, {{who went on to}} score 161); England, poised at 302 for 3 before Collingwood's dismissal, subsided to 425 all out. Nonetheless, England's seamers bowled Australia out for 215, and in the second innings Collingwood scored a measured 54, acting as <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> the aggressive strokeplay of Matt Prior (their partnership adding 86 in twelve overs) and Andrew Flintoff (51 in eight overs). As Flintoff and Graeme Swann combined to bowl England to victory, Collingwood contributed two fine slip catches.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the Evil Queen in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Lady Tremaine in Disney's Cinderella (1950), Gothel was {{developed}} by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard into a much more complex villain than the fairy tale witch upon whom she is based because the character is forced to rely solely on her wit, charisma and intelligence as opposed to sorcery in order to survive. The film's most difficult character to develop, Gothel's exotic appearance, whose beauty, dark curly hair and voluptuous figure were deliberately drawn {{to serve as a}} <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> Rapunzel's, was inspired by both Murphy and American singer Cher.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} team's {{approach to}} the character and Eccleston's portrayal were highlighted as being intentionally different from his predecessors, with Eccleston stating that his character would be less eccentric. To fit in with a 21st-century audience, the Doctor was given a primary companion, Rose Tyler, who {{was designed to be}} as independent and courageous as himself. He also briefly travels with Adam Mitchell, a self-serving boy genius who acts as a <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> the companions but ultimately proves unworthy, and Jack Harkness, a reformed con man from the 51st century. The Doctor, Rose and Jack form a close team but are separated in the series finale in which each character has to make difficult choices and face sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Gupte {{described}} his character as mercurial, and found playing him a physical delight. Gupte said his character keeps the frame unpredictable {{and that it}} provided him with a <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> express rage and anguish. He worked a lot on his characterisation and tried to bring in his own references from European and Japanese cinema. Chandan Roy Sanyal {{described his}} character Mikhail as provocative, mad, wicked and humorous. Subramnayam and Joshi, who played Lobo and Lele respectively, described their characters as the most corrupt policemen in their department at the Anti-Narcotics Bureau. They said that {{to prepare for the}} roles they followed the script and Bhardwaj's instructions to get the characters right. Mukherjee prepared for his role as Mujeeb by reading the script and understanding the characters, and discussing it with Bhardwaj. Dutta, who played Shumona Bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms dealingsaid {{that he did not have}} much time to prepare for his role because he was given the script after he arrived in Mumbai, where Bhardwaj briefed him.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, NOU was on {{tour with}} Bikini Kill, {{and when they}} arrived in Memphis, the found that the {{promoter}} for the show hadn't actually promoted the show. So, while {{out on the town}} flyering the streets and ducking into record stores, NOU ran into Primal Scream, a band which had been in town recording their own album. Primal Scream then decided to attend NOU's show at the Antenna Club, and then proceeded to invite NOU to record with them in the studio the next day. Nation of Ulysses then recorded five songs with Primal Scream in nine hours, though of course only after a quick errand for some tin <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> smoke a bit of crack, according to Tim Green. These recordings are known as Memphis Demos, and include the demos of N-Sub Ulysses, 50,000 Watts, Mockingbird, Yeah, and Shakedown.|$|E

5|$|Liz, part of Passions Russell family, is {{introduced}} as a resort owner {{involved in the}} love triangle between Sheridan Crane and Antonio Lopez-Fitzgerald and his brother Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald. She gains more prominence on the series as the antagonist and <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> her adoptive sister Eve Russell. Liz's desperation to expose her sister's past relationship—and child—with Julian Crane leads to {{the breakup of the}} latter's marriage and family. Later storylines focus on her relationship with Eve's husband T. C. Russell and attempts to murder Alistair Crane for raping her as a teenager. Liz eventually abandons her vendetta against Eve and Alistair in order to find love in the future. Following her exit from the series, Liz is identified as the biological mother of Chad Harris-Crane, which proves his relationship with Whitney Russell is not incestuous.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{borrowed}} {{the character of}} Banquo from Holinshed's Chronicles, a history of Britain published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587. In Chronicles Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth {{in the murder of}} the king, rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth. Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character to please King James, who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being a <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> Macbeth, resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it. Sometimes, however, his motives are unclear, and some critics question his purity. He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king, even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible.|$|E
5|$|Liz Sanbourne is the {{antagonist}} and <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> her adoptive sister Eve Russell. Initially {{identified only}} by her first name, Liz is first {{seen as the}} owner of a resort on the fictional St. Lisa's Island, located near Bermuda and the Bermuda Triangle. Liz is still in love with her former boyfriend Brian O'Leary. Her early appearances center on her attempts to reunite amnesiac Sheridan Crane with Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald, despite Brian's interest in her. When Liz arrives in Harmony, it is revealed that she is Eve's half-sister, and is later retconned to become her adoptive sister. Liz exposes Eve's past relationship with Julian Crane, inadvertently leading them to reunite and proving Chad Harris-Crane and Whitney Russell were not committing incest by her identification as Chad's mother. Liz harbors a deep desire for revenge against Eve for unknowingly abandoning her in an abusive household. Liz also seeks vengeance against the Crane family after she was raped by Alistair, and later forced to undergo surgery that made her barren. Liz leaves the show in February 2006, abandoning her vengeance against Eve, Julian, and Alistair to find a new life for herself.|$|E

50|$|TRIUMF {{has four}} {{independent}} extraction probes with various sizes of <b>foils</b> <b>to</b> provide protons simultaneously {{to up to}} four beam lines.

50|$|Fiske is {{best known}} by modern viewers for his portrayals of {{neurotic}} <b>foils</b> <b>to</b> The Three Stooges. Perhaps his most familiar role {{is that of the}} irate husband-turned-drill sergeant in 1940's Boobs in Arms. This performance would be recycled three years later in Dizzy Pilots.|$|R
5|$|When he was twelve, Parsons began {{attending}} Washington Junior High School, {{where he}} performed poorly—something biographer George Pendle attributed to undiagnosed dyslexia—and was bullied for his upper-class status and perceived effeminacy. Although unpopular, he formed a strong friendship with Edward Forman, a boy {{from a poor}} working-class family who defended him from bullies and shared his interest in science fiction and rocketry, with the well-read Parsons enthralling Forman with his literary prowess. In 1928 the pair—adopting the Latin motto per aspera ad astra (through hardship to the stars)—began engaging in homemade gunpowder-based rocket experiments in the nearby Arroyo Seco canyon, {{as well as the}} Parsons family's back garden, which left it pockmarked with craters from explosive test failures. They incorporated commonly available fireworks such as cherry bombs into their rockets, and Parsons suggested using glue as a binding agent to increase the rocket fuel's stability. This research became more complex when they began using materials such as aluminium <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> make the gunpowder easier to cast. Parsons had also begun to investigate occultism, and performed a ritual intended to invoke the Devil into his bedroom; he worried that the invocation was successful and was frightened into ceasing these activities. In 1929 he began attending John Muir High School, where he maintained an insular friendship with Forman and was a keen participant in fencing and archery. After he received poor school results, Parsons' mother sent him away to study at a private boarding school in San Diego—the Brown Military Academy for Boys—but he was expelled for blowing up the toilets.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Los Infernales won the Mexican National Trios Championship in Guadalajara, Jalisco {{and began}} feuding with La Familia de Tijuana (Nicho el Millonario, Halloween, and Damián 666). The trio lost the {{championship}} to La Familia in September 2002 but continued feuding {{with the group}} into 2003. Over the summer of 2003 Los Infernales won a tournament to become the number one contenders for the CMLL World Trios Championship but lost champions Black Tiger III, Dr. Wagner, Jr., and Universo 2000 on August 1. At {{the end of the}} year, Averno and Mephisto turned on El Satánico, but there was no major storyline feud between the three afterwards. In September 2004, Averno defeated Zumbido to win the vacant NWA World Middleweight Championship. Shortly after the championship win Averno was positioned as a rival or <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> the up-and-coming tecnico Místico. Averno and Mephisto also became de facto members of Los Guerreros del Infierno, joining forces with their former rivals. In February 2005, Averno lost the NWA World Middleweight Championship to Místico as part of their long running storyline. Two months later Averno and Mephisto defeated Atlantis and Blue Panther to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. When Shinsuke Nakamura and Hiroshi Tanahashi from New Japan Pro Wrestling came to CMLL, Averno initially teamed up with them, the two turned on him. This led to a trios match with Averno, Último Guerrero and Rey Bucanero defeating Nakamura, Tanahashi, and Shigeo Okumura in one of the featured bouts on the CMLL 72nd Anniversary Show. In early 2006 Averno and Mephisto were the catalyst for one of CMLL's big storylines as they defended their titles against Místico and Black Warrior twice. In the first match, they won by disqualification when Black Warrior interfered in the match after already being eliminated and in the second match Black Warrior turned on Místico, attacking his partner to end the match. In April 2006, they lost the tag team championship to Místico and Negro Casas, ending their 377-day-long reign.|$|E
25|$|A {{parody of}} Goodall {{appears in the}} webcomic, Irregular Webcomic! as a <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> Steve, himself a parody of Steve Irwin. She would later appear as herself {{interacting}} with the comic's writer, David Morgan-Mar.|$|E

Consequently, the TSP technique used with heating <b>foils</b> applied <b>to</b> a lower surface of slats showed that laminar-to-turbulent transition line on thin slats even at low temperatures and low Mach numbers could be reliably detected. ...|$|R
25|$|While governor, {{he ran for}} {{election}} to the first National Assembly of 1907 and was elected as the first Speaker of that body. Osmeña was 29 years old and already the highest-ranking Filipino official. He and another provincial politician, Manuel L.

25|$|Children of God (1987) further {{expanded}} Jarboe's role, {{acting as}} a <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> Michael Gira's tales of suffering, torture and humiliation. The stories portrayed here, however, are ever the more unusual, given their juxtaposition—and admixture—with religious imagery. The intention was neither to mock nor embrace religion, but experiment with the power inherent in its messages and the hypocrisy of many of its leaders.|$|E
25|$|Hawtrey {{acted in}} films {{from an early}} age, first {{appearing}} while still a child, and as an adult his youthful appearance and wit made him a <b>foil</b> <b>to</b> Will Hay's blundering old fool in the comedy films Good Morning, Boys (1937) and Where's That Fire? (1939). In all he appeared in more than 70 films, including from this period Alfred Hitchcock's Sabotage (1936).|$|E
