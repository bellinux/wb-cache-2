500|$|In 1961 and 1962 Bannon {{also contributed}} several {{articles}} to ONE, Inc., the magazine of a homophile activist organization in Southern California. One {{of them was}} a chapter that had been cut from the final draft of Women in the Shadows. She was invited to speak to the Mattachine Society in the early 1960s, but her husband's stern disapproval of her activities began to take its toll. She stated later, [...] "It began to be very painful. So every time <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>start</b> to reach out (to the lesbian/gay community), I would get struck down...In my own life, I couldn't operationalize (my feeling that gays should end the secrecy and take more pride in themselves and their lives). I couldn't find a way." ...|$|E

God I loved it... Allie Reynolds of the Yankees was tough, and I might think about him for 24 hours before a game, but Robert Feller: I'd think about him for three days." [...] Feller was ranked 36th on Sporting Newss list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and also the publication's [...] "greatest pitcher of his time" [...] {{as well as a}} finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999.

500|$|At World's End {{was meant}} to return it tonally to a {{character}} piece. Sparrow, in particular, is tinged with madness after extended solitary confinement in Davy Jones's Locker, and now desires immortality. Sparrow struggles with {{what it takes to}} be a moral person, after his honest streak caused his doom in the second film. This is mainly shown by his increasingly erratic behaviour and Jack's hallucinations, which appeared to be simply his deranged mind in the beginning where dozens of [...] "Jack Sparrows" [...] appeared to crew the ship in his solitary exile, but later the hallucinations grew more important and there were mainly two [...] "Jacks" [...] constantly arguing about which path to follow: the immortality or the mortality. The last hallucination took place while Jack was imprisoned on the Dutchman, where his honest streak won (possibly due to not liking his sea creature-like [...] "future", which comedically dropped his brain and searched for it around the Brig). By the end of At World's End, Sparrow is sailing to the Fountain of Youth, an early concept for the second film. Rossio said in 2007 that a fourth film was possible, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer expressed interest in a spin-off. Gore Verbinski concurred that [...] "all of the stories set in motion by the first film have been resolved. If there ever were another Pirates of the Caribbean film, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>start</b> fresh and focus on the further adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow." ...|$|E

[...] He is the {{great-grandson}} of Alhaji Alhassan Dantata, the richest African {{at the time of}} his death in 1955. Dangote has said, [...] "I can remember when I was in primary school, I would go and buy cartons of sweets [...] and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>start</b> selling them just to make money.

2500|$|Svetlana Khorkina {{was born}} on 19 January 1979, the {{daughter}} of Vasiliy and Lyubov. She has a younger sister, Yulia, {{who was also a}} gymnast. Khorkina said, [...] "As a child, I was very picky with my food. My mother hoped, that if she puts me into gymnastics, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>start</b> eating breakfast without frowning, after having spent a lot of energy in the gym. This is how, by simple nutritional reasons, I started my gymnastics career at the age of four." ...|$|E
30|$|In contrast, {{participants}} from the purposive group {{already had a}} more or less realistic sense of their current activity levels, e.g., “Seeing my initial numbers wasn’t surprising, I kind of expected it (…) well, I did buy it to become healthier, so I kind of knew <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be <b>starting</b> from the bottom” [P 7].|$|R

2500|$|At a 19 May press conference, de Gaulle {{asserted}} {{again that}} he was at the disposal of the country. As a journalist expressed the concerns of some who feared that he would violate civil liberties, de Gaulle retorted vehemently: [...] "Have I ever done that? On the contrary, I have re-established them when they had disappeared. Who honestly believes that, at age 67, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>start</b> a career as a dictator?" [...] A constitutionalist by conviction, he maintained throughout the crisis that he would accept power only from the lawfully constituted authorities. De Gaulle did not wish to repeat the difficulty the Free French movement experienced in establishing legitimacy as the rightful government. He told an aide that the rebel generals [...] "will not find de Gaulle in their baggage".|$|E
2500|$|Rogers {{possesses}} a full lyric soprano vocal range that spans 3 octaves. She {{is known for}} having an aggressive vocal delivery, incorporated with a soulful and emotive, distinct tone. Since the start of her career, Amerie has been heavily involved within the creative process of her music, receiving not only writing credits but production and instrumentation credits as well. In an interview with Myplay.com, she described her early process of recording music: [...] "I used to record songs that I wrote by using two different tape recorders and two separate tapes. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>start</b> by recording myself on the first tape, singing the song down from top to finish. Then, I would play it back, while singing the harmonies and recording them onto the second tape. I'd just keep repeating the process, {{going back and forth}} between tapes until I had a final version of the full song on one tape, with stacked harmonies, backgrounds and everything!".|$|E
2500|$|Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin said, [...] "What {{attracted}} me to [...] {{had nothing}} to do with Facebook. The invention itself is as modern as it gets, but the story is as old as storytelling; the themes of friendship, loyalty, jealousy, class and power. [...] I got a 14-page book proposal that Ben Mezrich had written for his publisher for a book he was going to call The Accidental Billionaires. The publisher was simultaneously shopping it around for a film sale. That's how it wound up in my hands. I was reading it and somewhere on page three I said yes. It was the fastest I said yes to anything. But Ben hadn't written the book yet, and I assumed that Sony was going to want me to wait for Ben to write the book, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>start</b> a year from now. They wanted me to start right away. Ben and I were kind of doing our research at the same time, sort of along parallel lines." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{felt that}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>start</b> back alone over the desert than trust myself {{in such a}} craft, on such a river. And it was all because I had had {{experience}} with bad rivers, and thought I was a judge of dangerous currents. The Colorado slid with a menacing roar out of a giant split in the red wall, and whirled, eddied, bulged on toward its confinement in the iron-ribbed canyon below.|$|R

I’d like to thank my mother and grandmother for always encouraging me to work up to my potential. You are not here to see it, but I know you’d be proud of this achievement. Donald A.
