5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army that would not unequivocally take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
5|$|In October 1893, a {{congress}} of miners {{was held in}} Grotte in the Province of Agrigento which was attended by some 1,500 people, including workers and small producers. The miners demanded that the minimum age to be raised to 14 years for those {{who worked in the}} sulfur mines, the decrease of working hours and setting a minimum wage. Small producers demanded measures to avoid exploitation by large owners. The minimum-age measure was meant to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> for the carusi, minors that worked in conditions of near-slavery that sparked public outrage and inspired many complaints.|$|E
5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and hamper British operations, a number of {{experienced}} night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting intruder operations over England. In 1940–41, German night fighters, lacking airborne radar sets and a means to locate them over Germany, had flown to British bomber bases and attempted to destroy RAF bombers as they returned from their missions. Adolf Hitler had ordered a cessation of these activities for propaganda and practical reasons but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and it was felt they may do so again.|$|E

5|$|On 22 October 2015 {{a letter}} was {{published}} in The Guardian signed by Rowling (along with over 150 other figures from arts and politics) opposing the cultural boycott of Israel, and announcing {{the creation of a}} network for dialogue, called Culture for Coexistence. Rowling later explained her position in more detail, saying that although she opposed most of Benjamin Netanyahu's actions she did not think the cultural boycott would bring about the removal of Israel's leader or help <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Israel and Palestine.|$|E
5|$|In 20 {{months of}} {{existence}} London Country North East had lost £5.5 million, on a turnover of £14 million. Two operating subsidiaries {{were created to}} help <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> {{under the control of}} a single holding company, initially called the London Country Travel Group and later renamed to South of England Travel Group. Its chief executive, Bob Howells, had previously been West Yorkshire Road Car Company's traffic manager. A third company, Cambridge based Premier Travel Services, was added to the group in 1989 but was sold to Cambus in 1991. Both subsidiaries continued to be owned by AJS until 1991, when they were sold to new owners.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} bottom right corner, two Polish Jews are {{on the edge of}} the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the effects of the}} negative income tax, in a matching model, on labor market participation. We show that the introduction of such instrument reduces unemployment and <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> of <b>the</b> poorest. But, amazingly, it provokes a fall on labor market participation principally because the agents are then less selective. We find another surprising result: despite the rise on participation, the increasing of unemployment benefits <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> of <b>the</b> firms at the expense of workers...|$|R

5|$|In March, {{hundreds}} {{of political prisoners}} were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming {{that there were no}} further political prisoners in Libya. In June, Libya's government issued the Great Green Charter on Human Rights in the Era of the Masses, in which 27 articles laid out goals, rights and guarantees to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> of human rights in Libya, restricting the use of the death penalty and calling for its eventual abolition. Many of the measures suggested in the charter would be implemented the following year, although others remained inactive. Also in 1989, the government founded the Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights, to be awarded to figures from the Third World who had struggled against colonialism and imperialism; the first year's winner was South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. From 1994 through to 1997, the government initiated cleansing committees to root out corruption, particularly in the economic sector.|$|E
5|$|In October 1931 Alcalá Zamora and his {{interior}} minister, Miguel Maura, resigned. Manuel Azaña became Prime Minister. Desiring {{the job for}} himself, Lerroux became alienated, and his Radical Party {{switched to}} the opposition, leaving Azaña dependent on the Socialists for support. The Socialists, who favoured reform, objected {{to the lack of}} progress. The reforms that were made alienated the land-holding right. Conditions for labourers remained dreadful; the reforms had not been enforced. Rural landowners declared war on the government by refusing to plant crops. Meanwhile, several agricultural strikes were harshly put down by the authorities. Reforms, including the unsuccessful attempt to break up large holdings, failed to significantly <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> for rural workers. By the end of 1931, King Alfonso, in exile, stopped attempting to prevent an armed insurrection of monarchists in Spain, and was tried and condemned to life imprisonment in absentia.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have often}} {{connected}} {{the notion of}} karma to the determinism in the caste system in India. Just like {{in the case of}} karma, some scholars believe that a belief in merit can cause social differences to stay unchanged. This would be the case when the poor, who cannot make much merit, resign to their fate. Other scholars point out that merit can be used to improve social status in the present, {{as in the case of}} someone ordaining as a monk for a few years. And vice versa, if someone's social status quickly deteriorates, for example, due to quick changes in the bureaucratic structure, these changes might be justified in Buddhist societies because someone's store of merit is believed to have run out. Someone's position in society, even in the cosmos, is always subject to the impermanent workings of merit and demerit. In traditional Buddhist societies, quick changes in position, status, or roles are therefore considered part of life, and this insecurity is a motivator in trying to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> through merit-making. Findly points out that in Buddhist ideals of merit-making, the earned value gained by doing good deeds is more important than the assigned value gained by social status at birth.|$|E

5|$|Under an Act of Parliament of 1874, the South Yorkshire {{company was}} {{absorbed into the}} Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. Despite the railway competition, traffic levels {{remained}} healthy, with the waterways carrying a total of 982,000 tons in 1878, {{but there was a}} growing dissatisfaction with the situation, particularly the high tolls compared to the railways, and the refusal to allow steam haulage, which had been in use on the neighbouring Aire and Calder Navigation for over 50 years. In an attempt to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Ltd was formed in 1888, with the intention of buying back the canals from the railway company, and upgrading them to offer effective competition to the railways. As a result of their efforts, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Co was created by an Act of Parliament dated 26 August 1889, with powers to raise £1.5 million to purchase and improve four canals. These were the Sheffield Canal, the River Don Navigation, the Dearne and Dove Canal and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. The intention was to upgrade the Don and the Stainforth and Keadby to take 300 or 400 ton barges, to investigate the use of compartment boats, and to build a new port facility at Keadby, where coal could be trans-shipped to seagoing vessels. Negotiations with the railway company were long and bitter, and the Navigation company only managed to raise £625,000 of the £1.14 million purchase price, with the result that although ownership of the waterways was transferred to them, the railway company still nominated five of the ten directors, and thus retained significant control.|$|E

25|$|While officially {{being named}} the Grove, the grounds {{to the south}} of Gisborne Court have been known as the Deer Park since deer were brought there in the 19th century.

However, the steam engines produced a lot of noise, which scared the horses and people, and produced a lot of air pollution.|$|E
