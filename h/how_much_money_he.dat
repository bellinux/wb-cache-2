[...] He continued, [...] "Even though this is just a song written {{from the perspective of a}} randy man watching a pole-dancer and bragging about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>he</b> has [...] in a manner which would make Akon blush, there's just something kind of cute about the whole thing." [...] McAlpine attributed this to the song's [...] "Tigger-beat", explaining, [...] "How can anything too sordid be going on when everyone is bouncing around like they're on spacehoppers?" [...] Bill Lamb of About.com commented, [...] "You will hear echoes of another pop classic, but the new song stands on its own feet."

According to Clarke, [...] "When we needed a scene in a bar, we went to Santa Monica and asked a guy <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>he</b> would charge to let us come in and shoot scenes in his bar". Because Clarke also acted in the film, editor and co-writer Tom Boutross served as co-director. Boutross later [...] The main character's home in the film was located on Lafayette Boulevard in Los Angeles, which is no longer standing. The four-story rooming house was rented for 5–6 weekend days for $25 per day. The exterior shots of the character's house were shot in a different location around Glendale Hill. A scene in the film where a transformed McKenna graphically crushes a rat with his bare hands was not in the script, and was improvised while on location. The effect was accomplished by placing ketchup on the rat; Clarke would then gently squeeze the rat, making the ketchup ooze from his fingers. This scene was removed from prints that were released on television, but was later restored.|$|E
500|$|A {{civil lawsuit}} was filed by Jordan Chandler {{and his parents}} on September 14, 1993. In late 1993, {{district}} attorneys in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties both convened grand juries to assess whether criminal charges should be filed against Jackson. By January 1, 1994, $2 million had been spent by prosecution departments in California and the grand juries had questioned 200 witnesses, but Jordan's allegations could not be corroborated. On January 4, 1994, Chandler's attorney, Larry Feldman, filed a motion for the photos from Jackson's December 1993 body search from investigators, saying Jackson's attorneys and the L.A. district attorney had refused to give him copies. A few weeks later, Feldman petitioned the court {{that he should be}} allowed access to Jackson's finances over concerns that the singer's wealth would give him an unfair advantage in court. One adviser to Jackson stated, [...] "You can take pictures of Michael's dick and he's not gonna like it, but once you start trying to figure out <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>he</b> has, that's where he stops playing around." [...] Initially Jackson and his lawyers filed a motion for Superior Court Judge David M. Rothman to postpone the civil case until the criminal investigation was concluded. Feldman filed a counter-motion, saying the delay would hurt Jordan's chances for recovery and {{make it more difficult to}} gather evidence. It is legal to postpone a civil lawsuit past the criminal statute of limitations as a lawsuit can still be filed past that date, such as the case of Pacers, Inc. v. Superior Court.

He was František Palacky's son-in-law and his successor in the leading of the Czech politics. He and his wife Marie Rieger bought the Maleč farm from Franz Xaver Auersperg in 1862. Rieger had already had experience with management of a farm in Suchdol between 1854 and 1857. The Suchdol farm, much smaller than Maleč, did not bring enough profit. Rieger sold the Suchdol farm and his saw mill in Semily and bought the Maleč domain for 300 000 guldens. It was a big investment and Rieger had to mortgage the farm as well as his wife's house in Prague. By the research I wanted to answer the following general questions: 1.

40|$|The recent {{worldwide}} tendency {{towards the}} introduction of commercially and privately provided roads proves to be efficient for building and operating road systems. One of the important issues concerning development of a private toll road is the selection of its capacity and toll charge and {{the evaluation of the}} relevant benefits to the private investor, the road users and the whole society. Yang and Meng [Transportation Research 34 A (2000) ] have recently examined this critical issue in a road network context. An important limitation in their analysis is that a single (average) value of time (VOT) for all road users is assumed in the network equilibrium model for traffic forecasts. It is a fact that each user has a different VOT, depending on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> or time <b>he</b> or she is willing or able to spend on a particular trip. This paper relaxes the earlier single VOT assumption using a multi-class network equilibrium model. The entire population of users is segmented into a number of groups or classes according to their VOT, and trip rates by different groups are characterized by distinct group-specific demand functions. Users are assumed to minimize their individual generalized trip cost, and thus divide themselves among the various alternative routes that are differentiated on the basis of travel time and monetary cost. With the explicit consideration of user heterogeneity, we investigate the various possibilities of profitability and welfare gain of a private toll road in a given network under various combinations of road capacity and toll charge. In particular, we compare and contrast the outcomes with the case of a single average VOT, and investigate how VOT distribution affects traffic flow and profit forecasts of private toll roads.

50|$|The initial {{proposal}} for the system was to simply mount the towed launcher, (less its running gear) and its petrol generator set on the flat bed of the M548 (diesel-powered) carrier. When this was shown to Mr G.R. Jefferson, the GW Managing Director, he was not very impressed and because <b>he</b> knew <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> was available <b>he</b> required a much more extensive change. The design engineers at Filton took this opportunity {{with both hands and}} under the guidance and control of Greville Beale and Adrian Pollicutt and without the restrictions that a government funded project imposed, a very significant new arrangement was produced in quite a short period. This included significant changes to the M548 vehicle to armour the vehicle, now designated RCM 748 and to incorporate an all new diesel powered generator set using the Coventry Climax H 30 engine (as used as the auxillary power unit in the Chieftain tank). The majority of the electronic equipment in the launcher was not changed significantly from that used in the towed version. However a completely redesigned armoured launcher with the capability of loading eight missiles was produced which was mounted via anti-vibration mounts to the flat bed of the vehicle. The armoured cab was provided with pan-climatic heating/cooling and NBC protection. The optical tracker was placed inside the armoured cab of the vehicle, elevating through the roof for operation. The tracker was operated from {{the right side of the}} crew cabin, while on the left were the driver and tactical controller who was also provided with a helmet-mounted sight, allowing him to lay on the tracker to a visual target. From moving to firing took only 30 seconds, a tremendous improvement over Towed Rapier, which required at least 15 minutes to unlimber, cable-up and align. A further difference between Towed and Tracked Rapier was that the Tracked Rapier launcher had eight (protected)missile rails compared with the four of the towed system, enhancing firepower and reducing re-supply requirements. It was also air-portable, ready to deploy on landing, in C130 aircraft. There was no room for Blindfire on a single RCM748 vehicle, so this was instead towed or was to be carried on a separate modified M548/RCM748. Feeding data to the control system in the firing unit again required setup time to connect the two equipments.|$|R
