40|$|Differences between {{reciprocal}} crosses {{are the result}} of breed <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> prenatal maternal effects and/or breed <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> postnatal maternal effects. Breed <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> postnatal maternal effects are well documented and are mediated through breed <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> milk production and perhaps through other maternal factors. Breed <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> prenatal maternal effects have received less attention by research interests than breed <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> postnatal maternal effects. Breed <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> prenatal maternal effects may be caused by either <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> ovum cytoplasm or by <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> uterine environment or by both.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we use {{data from the}} Health and Retirement Study to examine <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> {{retirement}} behavior, wealth, Social Security and pension benefits by race and gender. The differences observed among groups are sometimes substantial. We then estimate models jointly explaining retirement and wealth by race and gender.

By circumstances we mean both the opportunity set, and factors that determine the disutility of continued work, such as health status. We find that <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> outcomes among white, black and Hispanic males are not due to <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> preferences for leisure and goods consumption, but are due both to <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> time preference and to <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> circumstances. <b>Differences</b> <b>in</b> outcomes between men and women are primarily due to <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> preferences...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{decades of}} research, {{we do not}} know the {{functional}} significance of most sex <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the brain. We are heavily invested in the idea that sex <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> brain structure cause sex <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> behavior. We rarely consider the possibility that sex <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> brain structure may also prevent sex <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> overt functions and behavior, by compensating for sex <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> physiological conditions, e. g. gonadal hormone levels that may generate undesirable sex differences if left unchecked. Such a dual function for sex differences is unlikely to be restricted to adult brains. This review will entertain the possibility that transient sex <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> gene expression in developing brains may cause permanent <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> brain structure but prevent them as well, by compensating for potentially differentiating effects of sex <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> gonadal hormone levels and sex chromosomal gene expression.

40|$|Chemistry {{climate models}} (CCMs) {{have a common}} {{conceptual}} basis. <b>Differences</b> <b>in</b> implementation lead to <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the stratospheric ozone response to changes in composition and climate. Although evaluation by CCMVal- 2 identified {{strengths and weaknesses of}} participant models, the evaluation results were not used to discriminate among projections for future ozone evolution, at least in part because the overall diagnostic evaluation did not cleanly relate to the <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> CCM response. Here we use a subset of CCMVal diagnostics and additional analysis to understand the <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> response. In the upper stratosphere, <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> simulated temperature and total odd nitrogen prior to increases in chlorine loading explain the large <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> CCM sensitivity. In the lower atmosphere, there are two principle contributions to <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> CCM sensitivity to chlorine and climate change. First, <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the lower stratospheric ClO affect simulated sensitivity to chlorine. CCMs with best transport performance match NDACC column HCl measurements at a broad range of latitudes. Other CCMs disagree with observations due to <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> total inorganic chlorine, partitioning between HCl and ClONO 2, or both. <b>Differences</b> <b>in</b> ClONO 2 are directly related to <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> simulated ClO.

5|$|The <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> {{the hearing}} ranges for octopus and bigfin reef squids may be {{explained}} by the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> their habitats. The octopus is demersal (bottom-dwelling) with excellent camouflage capabilities. Bigfin reef squids, on the other hand, are usually in open water with limited hiding places. Hearing would thus be more important for the squids to escape predators. The ability to hear is particularly relevant for avoiding mammalian predators of the suborder Odontoceti (particularly dolphins), who use echolocation to find prey.|$|E

40|$|We examine three {{possible}} explanations for <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> Internet privacy concerns revealed by national regulation: (1) These differences reflect and are related to <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> cultural values described by other research; (2) these <b>differences</b> reflect <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> Internet experience; or (3) they reflect <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the desires of political institutions without reflecting underlying <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> privacy preferences. Using a sample of Internet users from 38 countries matched against the Internet population of the United States, we find support for (1) and (2), suggesting the need for localized privacy policies. Privacy concerns decline with Internet experience. Controlling for experience, cultural values were associated with <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> privacy concerns.

5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw to make up the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> length and account for tooth wear on the teeth {{at the tip of the}} snout. However, the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E

40|$|Comparisons {{of energy}} {{consumption}} patterns {{in different countries}} {{can serve as a}} tool for identifying inefficiencies in the use of energy in individual countries. However, <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> terms of relations {{such as the use of}} energy per capita or per unit of GDP are not usually very good indicators of intercountry <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the efficiency of energy use. Factors such as climatic conditions, the sectoral structure of the production system etc. often hide more basic <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> production methods and consumption patterns. Moreover, <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> production methods with similar output may not only be due to <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the efficiency of energy utilization, but can be the result of intercountry <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> relative prices. In this study, input-output data for the Federal Republic of Germany, France and the Netherlands is used to identify intercountry <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> per capita consumption patterns which can be assigned to <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> production methods and domestic consumption patterns.

40|$|I {{address the}} causes of the gender wage gap with a new dynamic model of wage, hours, and job changes that permits me to {{decompose}} the gap into a portion due to gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> preferences for part-time work and in constraints. The dynamic model allows the <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> constraints to reflect possible gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> job arrival rates, job destruction rates, the mean and variance of the wage offer distribution, and the full-time/part-time wage premium. I find that the <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> preferences explain no more than 5 % of the gender gap in hourly wages and 7 - 20 % of the gender gap in weekly wages. The <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> constraints, mainly in the form of <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the mean offered wages, explain the remaining gender wage gap.
