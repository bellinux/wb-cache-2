50|$|The tonne of {{trinitrotoluene}} (TNT) {{is used as}} a {{proxy for}} energy, usually of explosions (TNT is a common high explosive). Prefixes are used: kiloton(ne), megaton(ne), <b>gigaton(ne),</b> especially for expressing nuclear weapon yield, based on a specific combustion energy of TNT of about 4.2&#160;MJ/kg (or one thermochemical calorie per milligram). Hence, 1 t TNT = 4.2&#160;GJ, 1 kt TNT = 4.2&#160;TJ, 1&#160;Mt TNT = 4.2&#160;PJ.|$|E
50|$|For {{multiples}} of the tonne, {{it is more}} usual {{to speak}} of thousands or millions of tonnes. Kilotonne, megatonne, and <b>gigatonne</b> are more usually used for the energy of nuclear explosions and other events, often loosely as approximate figures. When used in this context, there is little need to distinguish between metric and other tons, and the unit is spelt either as ton or tonne with the relevant prefix attached.|$|E
5000|$|In {{combination}} with oxygen in carbon dioxide, carbon {{is found in}} the Earth's atmosphere (approximately 810 <b>gigatonnes</b> of carbon) and dissolved in all water bodies (approximately 36,000 <b>gigatonnes</b> of carbon). Around 1,900 <b>gigatonnes</b> of carbon are present in the biosphere. Hydrocarbons (such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas) contain carbon as well. Coal [...] "reserves" [...] (not [...] "resources") amount to around 900 <b>gigatonnes</b> with perhaps 18,000 Gt of resources. Oil reserves are around 150 <b>gigatonnes.</b> Proven sources of natural gas are about 175 10 cubic metres (containing about 105 <b>gigatonnes</b> of carbon), but studies estimate another 900 10 cubic metres of [...] "unconventional" [...] deposits such as shale gas, representing about 540 <b>gigatonnes</b> of carbon.|$|R
2500|$|Estimates of {{the size}} of the total carbon {{reservoir}} in Arctic permafrost and clathrates vary widely.

Furthermore, there are believed to be another 400 <b>gigatonnes</b> of carbon in methane clathrates in permafrost regions [...] with 10,000 to 11,000 <b>gigatonnes</b> worldwide. This is large enough that if 10% of the stored methane were released, it would have an effect equivalent to a factor of 10 increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a higher global warming potential than CO2.|$|R
25|$|The {{associated}} {{period of}} massive carbon injection {{into the atmosphere}} has been estimated to have lasted no longer than 20,000 years. The entire warm period lasted for about 200,000 years. Global temperatures increased by 5–8°C. The carbon dioxide was likely released in two pulses, the first lasting less than 2,000 years. Such a repeated carbon release {{is in line with}} current global warming. A main difference is that during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, the planet was essentially ice-free. However, the amount of released carbon, according to a recent study, suggest a modest 0.2 <b>gigatonnes</b> a year (at peaks 0.58 <b>gigatonnes),</b> humans today add about 10 <b>gigatonnes</b> a year.|$|R

Here we report novel evidence of efficient avoidance of such sampling by the most common myctophid fish in the Northern Atlantic, i. e. Benthosema glaciale. We reason that similar avoidance of nets may explain consistently higher acoustic abundance estimates of mesopelagic fish {{from different parts of}} the world’s oceans. It appears that mesopelagic fish abundance may be underestimated by one order of magnitude, suggesting that the role of mesopelagic fish in the oceans might need to be revised...|$|E

30|$|The {{practice}} of enclosing communal land {{can be seen}} as an important management tool for sustainable intensification of drylands within the general framework of a market-driven livestock revolution (Angassa and Oba 2010; Catley et al. 2013; McDermott et al. 2010; Verdoodt et al. 2010; Woodhouse 2003). For example, considering the vast areas of drylands and their current state of degradation, there is a huge potential to sequester C into these systems and simultaneously make them more productive (Neely et al. 2009). In Africa, 59  % of the total C stock is held in drylands (Campbell et al. 2008; UNEP 2008). Improvements in rangeland management, for example, through enclosures, have the potential to sequester 1.3 to 2 <b>gigatonne</b> carbon dioxide equivalents (Gt CO 2 eq) worldwide to 2030 (Smith et al. 2007). However, to be able to include livestock-based agro-pastoral drylands into the international C sequestration discourse and the associated potential payment schemes, a detailed understanding of C dynamics in different forms of enclosure management regimes is needed.|$|E

40|$|Nearly {{three-quarters of}} the growth in global carbon {{emissions}} from the {{burning of fossil fuels}} and cement production between 2010 and 2012 occurred in China. Yet estimates of Chinese emission remain subject to large uncertainty; inventories of China's total fossil fuel emissions in 2008 differ by 0. 3 <b>gigatonnes</b> of carbon, or 15 per cent. The primary sources of this uncertainty are conflicting estimates of energy consumption and emission factors, the latter being uncertain because of very few actual measurements representative of the mix of Chinese fuels. Here we re-evaluate China's carbon emissions using updated and harmonized energy consumption and clinker production data and two new and comprehensive sets of measured emission factors for Chinese coal. We find that total energy consumption in China was 10 per cent higher in 2000 - 2012 than the value reported by China's national statistics, that emission factors for Chinese coal are on average 40 per cent lower than the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and emissions from China's cement production are 45 per cent less than recent estimates. Altogether, our revised estimate of China's CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production is 2. 49 <b>gigatonnes</b> of carbon (2 standard deviations = +/- 7. 3 per cent) in 2013, which is 14 per cent lower than the emissions reported by other prominent inventories. Over the full period 2000 to 2013, our revised estimates are 2. 9 <b>gigatonnes</b> of carbon less than previous estimates of China's cumulative carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that overestimation of China's emissions in 2000 - 2013 may be larger than China's estimated total forest sink in 1990 - 2007 (2. 66 <b>gigatonnes</b> of carbon) or China's land carbon sink in 2000 - 2009 (2. 6 <b>gigatonnes</b> of carbon) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Heartland Area Redwater Project (HARP) for CO 2 {{storage is}} {{investigating}} the technical and economic feasibility of injecting significant volumes of CO 2 into the large water-saturated portion of a huge Devonian reef that is capped by a comparatively small oil reservoir, nevertheless the third largest oil pool in western Canada. The reef has a total areal extent of nearly 600  km 2, is more than 1, 000 meters deep and is up to 275 meters thick. Based on the high water injectivity in the reef, the potential exists to inject sustainably in excess of 1, 000 tonnes of CO 2 per day per well in the aquifer portion of the reef. Preliminary storage capacity estimates for the aquifer are {{in the order of}} one <b>gigatonne</b> of CO 2. This storage site has the potential to store CO 2 emissions in the order of several tens of Mt/yr from major emitters in central and northeastern Alberta such as oil sands plants, bitumen upgraders, refineries and petrochemical and fertilizer plants.

40|$|Spatial leakage {{is a major}} {{limitation}} for quantitative {{interpretation of}} satellite gravity measurements from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE). Using synthetic data to simulate ice mass changes in the Amundsen Sea Embayment and Antarctic Peninsula, we analyze quantitatively {{the effects of a}} limited range of spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients and additional filtering, which in combination can significantly attenuate signal amplitudes. We present details of a forward modeling algorithm and show that it is capable of removing these biases from GRACE estimates. Examples show how to implement the method by constraining locations of presumed mass changes, or leaving these locations unspecified within a continental region. Our analysis indicates that leakage effects from far-field mass signals (e. g., terrestrial water storage change and glacial melting over other continents) on Antarctic mass rate estimates appear to be negligible. However, leakage from long-term ocean bottom pressure change in the surrounding Antarctic Circumpolar Current regions may bias Antarctic mass rate estimates by up to 20 <b>Gigatonne</b> per year (Gt/year). Experiments based on proxy GRACE measurement noise indicate that the effects of GRACE spatial noise on estimated Antarctic mass rates via constrained and unconstrained forward modelings are 5 and 15 Gt/year, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Introducing new {{technologies}} into infrastructure (wind turbines, electric vehicles, low-carbon materials and so on) often demands {{materials that are}} ‘critical’; their supply {{is likely to be}} disrupted owing to limited reserves, geopolitical instability, environmental issues and/or increasing demand. Non-critical materials may become critical if introduced into infrastructure, owing to its <b>gigatonne</b> scale. This potentially poses significant risk to the development of low-carbon infrastructure. Analysis of this risk has previously overlooked the relationship between the ‘local properties’ that determine the selection of a technology and the overall vulnerability of the system, a global property. Treating materials or components as elements having fixed properties overlooks optima within the local–global variable space that could be exploited to minimise vulnerability while maximising performance. In this study, a framework for such analysis is presented along with a preliminary measure of relative materials criticality by way of a case study (a wind turbine generator). Although introduction of critical materials (in this case, rare earth metals) enhances technical performance by up to an order of magnitude, the associated increase in criticality may be two or three orders of magnitude. Analysis at the materials and component levels produces different results; design decisions should be based on analysis at several levels...|$|E

If phytoplankton converted all the nitrate and phosphate present in the surface mixed layer across the entire Antarctic circumpolar current into organic carbon, the resulting carbon dioxide deficit could be compensated by uptake from the atmosphere amounting to about 0.8 to 1.4 <b>gigatonnes</b> of carbon per year.

40|$|ALTHOUGH {{anthropogenic}} {{emissions of carbon}} dioxide have today created a greater atmospheric CO 2 concentration in the Northern than in the Southern Hemisphere, a comparison of interhemispheric CO 2 profiles from 1980 and 1962 led Keeling and Heimann 1, 2 to conclude that, before the Industrial Revolution, natural CO 2 sources and sinks acted to set up a reverse (south to north) gradient which drove about one <b>gigatonne</b> of carbon each year through the atmosphere from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere. At steady state, this flux must have been balanced by a counter flow of carbon from north to south through the ocean. Here we present a means to estimate this natural flux by a separation of oceanic carbon anomalies into those created by biogenic processes and those created by CO 2 exchange between the ocean and atmosphere. We find that before the Industrial Revolution, deep water formed in the northern Atlantic Ocean carried about 0. 6 gigatonnes of carbon annually to the Southern Hemisphere, providing support for Keeling and Heimann's proposal. The existence of this oceanic carbon pump also raises questions about the need for a large terrestrial carbon sink in the Northern Hemisphere, as postulated by Tans et al. 3, to balance the present global carbon budget. ...|$|E

Intensive activity is currently focused upon a small pilot site within the water leg of the reef. Should this pilot program prove to be successful, CO 2 injection, and the associated monitoring program, may be scaled up to allow an annual injection of up to 1  million tonnes of CO 2.

40|$|The IMAGE {{integrated}} assessment {{model was}} used to develop a set of scenarios to evaluate the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by Parties under the Paris Agreement. The scenarios project emissions and energy system changes under (i) current policies, (ii) implementation of the NDCs, and (iii) various trajectories to a radiative forcing level of 2. 8 W/m 2 in 2100, which gives a probability of about two thirds to limit warming to below 2 °C. The scenarios show that a cost-optimal pathway from 2020 onwards towards 2. 8 W/m 2 leads to a global greenhouse gas emission level of 38 <b>gigatonne</b> CO 2 equivalent (GtCO 2 eq) by 2030, equal to a reduction of 20 % compared to the 2010 level. The NDCs are projected to lead to 2030 emission levels of 50 GtCO 2 eq, which is still an increase compared to the 2010 level. A scenario that achieves the 2. 8 W/m 2 forcing level in 2100 from the 2030 NDC level requires more rapid transitions after 2030 to meet the forcing target. It shows an annual reduction rate in greenhouse gas emissions of 4. 7 % between 2030 and 2050, rapidly phasing out unabated coal-fired power plant capacity, more rapid scale-up of low-carbon energy, and higher mitigation costs. A bridge scenario shows that enhancing the ambition level of NDCs before 2030 allows for a smoother energy system transition, with average annual emission reduction rates of 4. 5 % between 2030 and 2050, and more time to phase out coal capacity...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe rise in GHG {{emissions}} {{from the oil}} sands industry has prompted government and industry to seek ways to reduce its CO 2 output. CCS is currently the leading option in Alberta. A key to making it viable {{is a system that}} allows multiple emitters to gather, capture, and transport their CO 2 to the best sinks, efficiently and economically. The oil sands are located in Northern Alberta. Geological formations suitable for CO 2 storage exist in the South-West region, ∼ 400  km from the sources. Implementing CCS will necessitate transporting roughly 30  megatonnes of CO 2 to suitable sinks. One of the best sinks is the underground aquifer in the Redwater Reef near Ft. Saskatchewan, with an estimated preliminary capacity of one <b>gigatonne</b> of CO 2, or 37 years of CO 2 {{emissions from}} oil sands, at 2007 rates. In this study, we compare two schemes to transport CO 2 from oil sands operations by capturing CO 2 and: (1) transporting it in its supercritical state to storage in the Redwater Reef and (2) transporting it in solution to Redwater, regenerating the solvent on-site and storing the CO 2 in the Redwater Reef. The fugitive emissions of Case 1 are consistently higher than those of Case 2. This is due to the former’s electricity demands {{and the fact that the}} emissions associated with energy for solvent regeneration are not captured. Case 1 is more susceptible to electricity cost fluctuations than Case 2, but the latter is more susceptible to changes in the price of fuel. Although the CAPEX is similar for both, Case 2 benefits more from economies of scale than Case 1; the OPEX for Case 1 is 3. 5 % higher. The avoidance costs of Case 2 are lower on a gross basis (111 vs. 114 $/tonne CO 2) and on a net basis (327 vs. 851 $/tonne CO 2) ...|$|E
