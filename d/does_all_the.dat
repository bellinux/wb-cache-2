5|$|Finally, Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) {{falls for}} a new staffer, a blind woman named Jennifer (Maria Thayer). Kenneth cannot bring himself to ask Jennifer out, so Tracy (Tracy Morgan) decides to help him. On their date, at the 30 Rock studios, Kenneth and Jennifer are joined by Tracy—who <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> talking. Jennifer {{believes}} Kenneth is black, but Kenneth reveals he is white and expresses his feeling for her, and admits to her that Tracy was doing all the talking. Jennifer tells him she does not mind of what has happened. However, after feeling Kenneth's face and comparing it to her own, she leaves, horrified at his appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} is nocturnal {{over most of}} its range, but in Britain and some Pacific islands, it also hunts by day. Barn owls specialise in hunting animals {{on the ground and}} nearly all of their food {{consists}} of small mammals which they locate by sound, their hearing being very acute. They mate for life unless one of the pair gets killed, when a new pair bond may be formed. Breeding takes place at varying times of year according to locality, with a clutch, averaging about four eggs, being laid in a nest in a hollow tree, old building or fissure in a cliff. The female <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> incubation, and she and the young chicks are reliant on the male for food. When large numbers of small prey are readily available, barn owl populations can expand rapidly, and globally the bird is considered to be of least conservation concern. Some subspecies with restricted ranges are more threatened.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Bart is {{not ready}} for the {{upcoming}} Springfield Elementary science fair. He ends up working with Martin Prince and after Bart {{comes up with a}} general idea—cool robotics—Martin <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> work and constructs an adorable robotic baby seal. However, it is revealed that when the wiring is tampered with, they become violent attackers. The seal wins first prize at the Fair, to Lisa's disdain. When she goes to the Springfield Retirement Castle to whine about the injustice to Grampa, the seniors citizen see the seal visibly cheer up Jasper and the value of the invention becomes clear. All of the senior citizens then get their own seals, and they become happier and healthier, which angers a consortium of local businesses (led by the local funeral home) who want the oldsters to go back to being miserable and more rapidly dying. The group figures out the wiring secret and reworks the seals so their fury returns, even causing the death of Mrs. Glick. Chief Wiggum has all the robots impounded. Bart and Martin enlist the aid of Professor Frink who then gets a larger group of nerds to remotely hack into the robot software and make them nice again. They succeed and as a result, Chief Wiggum releases all the seals, who return to the nursing home.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two ways}} to {{configure}} a breeder reactor to do the required breeding. One can place the fertile and fissile fuel together, so breeding and splitting occurs in the same place. Alternatively, fissile and fertile can be separated. The latter is known as core-and-blanket, because a fissile core produces the heat and neutrons while a separate blanket <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> breeding.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{rural and}} tribal women {{do all the}} {{household}} related chores. Heavy works that require more strength {{is done by the}} husband. Now, the chore work is evenly distributed with the men doing just as much work as the women. The scope of their functions include cooking, cleaning, teaching the children, washing clothes, repairs, budgeting, and helping in the farm. The husband is the one who makes sure the farm would yield quality crops, so he <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> maintenance work. In some cases, where the husband needs help from other men, the wife would make sure that the men are fed, so she cooks food and bring it to the farm. The Filipino women, ensures that everyone is well fed, including any workers, relatives, or visitors.|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} storyline and characters, RPGamer welcomed the characters' depth, and the {{emphasis}} placed into the personalities and development of supporting characters, asserting that previous Castlevania games ignored {{the development of the}} supporting characters in exchange for concentrating on the protagonist. IGN called the game's ending [...] "incredibly unfulfilling and disappointing," [...] but lauded the change from the conventional plot of a Castlevania game, in which a member of the Belmont clan defeats Dracula {{with the aid of a}} host of supporting characters. GameSpy criticized the presence of a [...] "weak female who needs protection" [...] and an [...] "effeminate-looking man who <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> slaying" [...] as stereotypical Castlevania elements, but noted that the [...] "powerful and compelling scenario" [...] the game had was the best in the series since Symphony of the Night.|$|E
500|$|Stephen {{was written}} by Kesha Sebert, in {{collaboration}} with her mother Pebe Sebert, David Gamson, and Oliver Leiber. The song was produced by Gamson with additional production by Leiber. Gamson played all the instruments on the song, {{with the exception of}} the accordion which was performed by Kesha. The song's recording was commenced at ACME Recording, Long Island, California, and at Ollywood Studios, Hollywood, California, by Gamson. Kesha told Rolling Stone that Stephen was one of her favorite tracks on the album. She explained that the song stemmed from her experiences with a man that she had been [...] "stalking since [...] was 15." [...] It was written when the singer was sixteen, in collaboration with her mother. She found David Gamson to produce the song. [...] "He <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> keyboard stuff, he's amazing, a crazy cynical genius guy, and he liked my voice and my thing, and I really liked his thing, so we decided to work together" [...] she explained.|$|E

500|$|All {{characters}} {{are designed to}} speak with their own internal voices to capture their views of the world. The Atlantic pondered whether Martin ultimately intended the readers to sympathize with characters {{on both sides of}} the Lannister–Stark feud long before plot developments force them to make their emotional choices. Contrary to most conventional epic fantasies, the Ice and Fire {{characters are}} vulnerable so that, according to The Atlantic, the reader [...] "cannot be sure that good shall triumph, which makes those instances where it <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more exulting." [...] Martin gets emotionally involved in the characters' lives during writing, which makes the chapters with dreadful events sometimes very difficult to write. Seeing the world through the characters' eyes requires a certain amount of empathy with them, including the villains, all of whom he has said he loves as if they were his own children. Martin found that some characters had minds of their own and took his writing in different directions. He returns to the intended story if it does not work out, but these detours sometimes prove more rewarding for him.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{sequence}} of [...] "Jame Raho" [...] establishes {{the characters of}} the four members of Ishaan's family; for example, the father is hardworking and responsible, and Yohaan is an [...] "ideal son" [...] who <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> right things. A robotic style of music overlaps most of the sequence—this is mirrored by the machine-like morning routines of the mother, father, and Yohaan—but changes for Ishaan's portion to imply that he {{is different from the}} rest. This concept is furthered by speed ramping and having the camera sway with the music to create a distinct style. The twilight scenes of [...] "Maa" [...] were a particular issue for the production crew. Because the specific lighting only lasted ten to fifteen minutes a day, the scenes took nearly ten evenings to film. Production at one time considered having a child singing, but ultimately deemed it too over the top and felt it would connect to more people if sung by an adult. Shankar initially performed the song as a sample—they planned to replace him with another singer—but production eventually decided that his rendition was best.|$|E
500|$|Soma's {{character}} has received praise and criticism from several video game publications. GameSpy noted that although Soma {{fell into the}} stereotypical role of [...] "an effeminate-looking man who <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> slaying", the original scenario that Aria of Sorrow presented provided a better context for his character. The fact that Soma was {{not a member of}} the Belmont clan, the protagonists of most Castlevania games, was lauded by IGN and RPGamer, with the latter commenting on how it contributed to the [...] "depth" [...] of the storyline. The manner in which Soma's [...] "power of dominance" [...] translated into the [...] system featured in both games was widely acclaimed; IGN commented that it contributed [...] "significantly" [...] to the overall feel of Aria of Sorrow, and RPGamer celebrated the [...] "triumphant return" [...] of the Tactical Soul system in Dawn of Sorrow. Reviewers also complimented Soma's graphical representation. GameSpy noted the [...] "good animation on easily viewable sprites" [...] in Aria of Sorrow, and GameSpot called the graphics in Dawn of Sorrow [...] "intricate and gorgeous", making note of the character sprites. The change to an anime design in Dawn of Sorrow was criticized. GameSpy deplored the [...] "shallow, lifeless anime images" [...] used for Soma's in-game representation, and Kojima's absence from the production. IGN claimed that the images were [...] "down to the level of 'generic Saturday morning Anime' quality." [...] Nevertheless, RPGFan felt that the story created around Soma was the best presented in the series since Symphony of the Night.|$|E

2500|$|In New South Wales, {{students}} are being issued with Lenovo laptops {{no bigger than}} a sheet of A4 paper. In 2009 the model issued was the IdeaPad S10e, in 2010, the ThinkPad Mini 10 in 2011, the ThinkPad Edge 11, in 2012 the ThinkPad X130e which has been uniquely designed [...] and in 2013, the ThinkPad X131e. The laptops also come with pre-installed software, such as Adobe CS5, Adobe LiveCycle ES2, Microsoft Office 2010, and Microsoft Forefront. In June 2010 a recall of laptop cases was issued after it was found that there was a flaw {{in the design of the}} case when several students reported that their screens had cracks. The New South Wales Department of Education and Training's Chief Information Officer Stephen Wilson said that the filtering system on the laptops is impervious and no student will be able to break through the system. [...] "Our internet filtering is unbreakable. We have a huge proxy array that <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> filtering. We've just brought that in-house and the reason we have done that is we want much tighter control over it, every internet site that's known is actually categorised. If it isn't known, it's blocked.

[...] A second poster was also released, which again featured Riseborough and D'Arcy as Wallis and Edward, about to kiss on a beach. Written on the top left of the poster is the following line: [...] "One of the greatest love stories of all time, the king who gave up his throne for the woman he loved." [...] Throughout January 2012, Madonna appeared on two different television shows and talked about the film. She first appeared on the ABC show called Nightline, where she chatted with the host Cynthia McFadden about W.E. Then she appeared on The Graham Norton Show in the United Kingdom, where she was accompanied by D'Arcy and Riseborough. The UK and US premiere for the film took place on January 11 and 23, 2012, respectively.|$|E
