2500|$|The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is {{sponsoring}} a multi-year study of value-added modeling with their Measures of Effective Teaching program. [...] Initial results, released in December 2010, indicate that both value-added modeling and student perception of several key teacher traits, such as {{control of the}} classroom and challenging students with rigorous work, correctly identify <b>effective</b> <b>teachers.</b> [...] The study about student evaluations was done by Ronald Ferguson. [...] The study also discovered that teachers who teach to the test are much less effective, and have significantly lower value-added modeling scores, than teachers who promote a deep conceptual understanding of the full curriculum. Reanalysis of the MET report’s results conducted by Jesse Rothstein, an economist and professor at University of California, Berkeley, dispute some of these interpretations, however. Rothstein argues that the analyses in the report do not support the conclusions, and that [...] "interpreted correctly... undermine rather than validate value-added-based approaches to teacher evaluation.” [...] More recent work from the MET project, however, validates the use of value added approaches.|$|E
