50|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that such a paradox might not be {{necessarily}} caused by {{the reduction of the}} predator population by harvesting itself, for example, by a pesticide. The host population is reduced at the moment of harvesting, and simultaneously, the intraspecific <b>density</b> <b>effect</b> is weakened. Intraspecific competition accounts for the competition between individuals of a same species. When the population density is high and resources are consequently relatively scarce, each individual has less access to resources to invest energy in growth, survivorship and reproduction. That causes a decrease in the survival rate or an increase in mortality.|$|E

5000|$|Studies show {{also that}} direct {{effects on the}} {{predator}} population, through harvesting of the prey, are not necessary to observe the paradox. Harvesting of prey {{has been shown to}} trigger a reduction in the predator’s reproduction rate, which lowers the equilibrium predator level. Thus, changes in life history strategy (patterns of growth, reproduction and survivorship) can also contribute to the paradox. [...] Seemingly the paradox can be accounted for by the indirect effects of harvesting on the native ecological interactions of prey and predator: reduction of intraspecific <b>density</b> <b>effect</b> for the prey and reduction of the reproductive rate for the predator. The former increases the population recovery of the prey, and the latter decreases the equilibrium population level for the predator.|$|E
50|$|The coolant greatly reduces its density {{at the end}} of the core, {{resulting}} in a need to place extra moderator there. A LWR type SCWR design adopts water rods in the fuel assemblies. Most designs of CANDU type SCWR use an internal calandria where part of the feedwater flow is guided through top tubes through the core, that provide the added moderation (feedwater) in that region. This has the added advantage of being able to cool the entire vessel wall with feedwater, but results in a complex and materially demanding (high temperature, high temperature differences, high radiation) internal calandria and plena arrangement. Again a pressure-tube design has potentially fewer issues, as most of the moderator is in the calandria at low temperature and pressure, reducing the coolant <b>density</b> <b>effect</b> on moderation, and the actual pressure tube can be kept cool by the calandria water.|$|E
5000|$|More practically, {{distance}} {{methods are}} avoided because {{the relationship between}} individual characters and the tree is lost {{in the process of}} reducing characters to distances. These methods do not use character data directly, and information locked in the distribution of character states can be lost in the pairwise comparisons. Also, some complex phylogenetic relationships may produce biased distances. On any phylogram, branch lengths will be underestimated because some changes cannot be discovered at all due to failure to sample some species due to either experimental design or extinction (a phenomenon called the node <b>density</b> <b>effect).</b> However, even if pairwise distances from genetic data are [...] "corrected" [...] using stochastic models of evolution as mentioned above, they may more easily sum to a different tree than one produced from analysis of the same data and model using maximum likelihood. This is because pairwise distances are not independent; each branch on a tree is represented in the distance measurements of all taxa it separates. Error resulting from any characteristic of that branch that might confound phylogeny (stochastic variability, change in evolutionary parameters, an abnormally long or short branch length) will be propagated through all of the relevant distance measurements. The resulting distance matrix may then better fit an alternate (presumably less optimal) tree.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: History drives {{community}} assembly through differences both in <b>density</b> (<b>density</b> <b>effects)</b> {{and in the}} sequence in which species arrive (sequence <b>effects).</b> <b>Density</b> <b>effects</b> arise from predictable population dynamics, which are free of history, but sequence effects are due to a density-free mechanism, arising solely from the order and timing of immigration events. Few studies have determined how components of immigration history (timing, number of individuals, frequency) alter local dynamics to determine {{community assembly}}, beyond addressing when immigration history produces historically contingent assembly. METHODS/FINDINGS: We varied <b>density</b> and sequence <b>effects</b> independently in a two-way factorial design to follow community assembly in a three-species aquatic protozoan community. A superior competitor, Colpoda steinii, mediated alternative community states; early arrival or high introduction density allowed this species to outcompete or suppress the other competitors (Poterioochromonas malhamensis and Eimeriidae gen. sp.). Multivariate analysis showed that <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> caused greater variation in community states, whereas sequence effects altered the mean community composition. CONCLUSIONS: A significant interaction between <b>density</b> and sequence <b>effects</b> suggests that we should refine our understanding of priority effects.

40|$|AbstractYeasts {{in culture}} media grow {{exponentially}} in early period but eventually stop growing. The saturation {{of population growth}} is due to “density effect”. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is known to exhibit an age-dependent cell division. Daughter cell, which gives no birth, has longer generation time than mother, because daughter needs maturing period. So far, investigations in exponential growth period have been intensively accumulated, but very little is known for the stage dependence of <b>density</b> <b>effect.</b> Here we present an “in vivo” study of <b>density</b> <b>effect,</b> applying a lattice gas model to explore the age-structure dynamics. It is, however hard to solve basic equations, because they have {{an infinite number of}} variables and parameters. The basic equations are constructed from several simplified models which have few variables and parameters. These simplified models are compared with experimental data to report two findings for stage-dependent density effect: 1) paradox of decline birthrate (PDB), and 2) mass suicide of aged mothers. These events suddenly and temporarily occur at early stage of <b>density</b> <b>effect.</b> The mother-daughter model leads to PDB. Namely, when the birthrate of population is decreased, then the fraction of daughter is abruptly increased. Moreover, we find the average age of yeast population suddenly decreases at the inflection point. This means the mass apoptosis of aged mothers. Our results for <b>density</b> <b>effect</b> imply the existence of several types of “pheromones” that specifically inhibit the population growth...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> and {{individual}} differences in life history {{are considered to be}} important for evolution, these factors lead to several difficulties in understanding the evolution of life history, especially when population sizes reach the carrying capacity. r/K selection theory explains what types of life strategies evolve in the presence of <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> and individual differences. However, the relationship between the life schedules of individuals and population size is still unclear, even if the theory can classify life strategies appropriately. To address this issue, we propose a few equations on adaptive life strategies in r/K selection where <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> are absent or present. The equations detail not only the adaptive life history but also the population dynamics. Furthermore, the equations can incorporate temporal individual differences, which are referred to as internal stochasticity. Our framework reveals that maximizing <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> is an evolutionarily stable strategy related to the carrying capacity. A significant consequence of our analysis is that adaptive strategies in both selections maximize an identical function, providing both population growth rate and carrying capacity. We apply our method to an optimal foraging problem in a semelparous species model and demonstrate that the adaptive strategy yields a lower intrinsic growth rate as well as a lower basic reproductive number than those obtained with other strategies.

This study investigates one plausible source of the emergence of phono-logical awareness, phonological neighbourhood density. As vocabulary grows, the number of similar-sounding words in the child's mental lexicon increases. This could create developmental pressure to develop awareness of sub-units within words such as syllables, rhymes and phonemes. If this is the case, then neighbourhood <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> should be discernible in phonological awareness tasks. Children should be more successful in these tasks with words from dense phonological neighbourhoods, as they should show greater awareness of sub-units within these words. We investigated this hypothesis in a group of 48 five-year-old children, most of whom were pre-readers. The five-year-olds with a high vocabulary age showed neighbourhood <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> in a rhyme oddity task, but five-year-olds with lower vocabulary ages did not. This suggests that vocabulary acquisition and consequent neighbourhood <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> are indeed one source of the emergence of phonological awareness skills in pre-readers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Saltwater {{intrusion}} from saline formation {{waters in}} the shallow lowlands {{of the state of}} Brandenburg, Germany, is simulated using a 2 D density-dependent (dd) flow and transport model. Based on the geological situation and the present-day chemical composition of the groundwaters in that region, migration scenarios with and without inclusion of <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> are modelled. We find that, due to the shallowness of the aquifer system, the surficial topography has a large effect on the flow and migration patterns and, especially, gives rises to upwelling flow underneath the discharge area of the Nuthe river. Comparing models, with and without <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> included, we then investigate possible saltwater upconing due this natural discharge flow pattern. A sensitivity study of the hydrodynamic dispersion and of the anisotropy of the aquifer {{is at the heart of}} the investigation. The results of the models show that <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> are diminishing for large values of the dispersivity and high anisotropy ratios. This means that for the management of saltwater intrusion, instead of using a complicated dd flow and transport model, it may be sufficient in most practical situation to use a passive transport model, which would have a much smaller computational time. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for describing the <b>density</b> <b>effect</b> occurring in self-thinning populations is developed {{on the basis}} of the following three basic assumptions: (1) the growth of yield follows the general logistic equation; (2) final yield becomes constant irrespective of initial density; and (3) there exists a functional relationship between actual and initial densities. The resultant equation takes the same reciprocal form as the reciprocal equation derived from Shinozaki-Kira's theory, i. e., the logistic theory of the C-D effect, which deals with the <b>density</b> <b>effect</b> occurring in nonself-thinning populations. It is, however, recognized that one of the two coefficients is quite different in mathematical interpretation between the two reciprocal equations based on the present theory and the logistic theory of the C-D effect, respectively. The present conclusion is consistent with the empirical facts that the reciprocal relationship between yield (or mean phytomass) and density is discernible in not only nonself-thinning populations, but also self-thinning populations. The present model is expected to systematically interpret underlying mechanisms be tween the <b>density</b> <b>effect,</b> which is observed at a time constant among populations varying in initial density, and self-thinning, which is observed along a time continuum in any given population...|$|E
40|$|Biologists {{have found}} that the death rate of cells in culture depends upon their spatial density. Permanent "Stay alive" signals from their {{neighbours}} seem to prevent them from dying. In a previous paper (Wang et al. 2013) we gave evidence for a <b>density</b> <b>effect</b> for ants. In this paper we examine whether there is a similar effect in human demography. We find that although there is no observable relationship between population density and overall death rates, there is a clear relationship between density and the death rates of young age-groups. Basically their death rates decrease with increasing density. However, this relationship breaks down around 300 inhabitants per square kilometre. Above this threshold the death rates remains fairly constant. The same <b>density</b> <b>effect</b> is observed in Canada, France, Japan and the United States. We also observe a striking parallel between the <b>density</b> <b>effect</b> and the so-called marital status effect {{in the sense that they}} both lead to higher suicide rates and are both enhanced for younger age-groups. However, it should be noted that the strength of the <b>density</b> <b>effect</b> is only a fraction of the strength of the marital status effect. In spite of the fact that this parallel does not give us an explanation by itself, it invites us to focus on explanations that apply to both effects. In this light the "Stay alive" paradigm set forth by Prof. Martin Raff appears as a natural interpretation. It can be seen as an extension of the "social ties" framework proposed at the end of the 19 th century by the sociologist Emile Durkheim in his study about suicide.

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of in-cylinder heat transfer {{is important because}} engine operating parameters such as in-cylinder temperature and pressure are affected by heat transfer. In-cylinder heat transfer modeling in multi-dimensional numerical approaches is wall-layer modeling in which a simplified one-dimensional energy equation is solved to obtain a heat flux equation. Based on the review of previous studies on in-cylinder heat transfer modeling, {{the most important issue}} is the employment of variable <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> into in-cylinder heat transfer modeling. Despite their importance, full variable <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> have not been employed in previous studies and their quantitative importance has not been investigated. Furthermore, heat transfer modeling is expected to be affected by turbulence modeling because a heat flux equation of heat transfer modeling is a function of turbulent quantities. However, the effects of turbulence modeling on predictions of thermal conditions have not been investigated. Finally, HCCI combustion processes are significantly influenced by thermal conditions and therefore, heat transfer influences HCCI combustion. However, the effects of one-dimensional heat transfer modeling on predictions of an HCCI combustion engine have not been examined. In this thesis, Variable Density Heat Transfer (VDHT) model is developed by employing the <b>effects</b> of <b>density,</b> dynamic viscosity variation and variable <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> on turbulent Prandtl number and eddy viscosity ratio variation with a power-law approximation. Through the quantification of parameter effects and comparisons of numerical results between VDHT model and the heat transfer model built in KIVA 3 V, details of variable <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> are discussed. The effects of turbulence modeling on predictions of thermal conditions are investigated. Heat transfer models are applied to an HCCI engine and details of heat transfer modeling effects on predictions of HCCI combustion processes are investigated. The results show that variable <b>density</b> <b>effects</b> are proportional to the difference between wall temperature and core temperature. Heat flux predictions by VDHT model are larger than those by the heat transfer model built in KIVA 3 V by upto 100 %.
