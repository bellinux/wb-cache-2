40|$|What is the co-relation {{between the}} {{characteristics}} of two firms that form a relationship with each other, especially successful relations? Surprisingly there is little {{we know about the}} answers to this question. This paper reviews previous literature on the assortative mating among people and animals and the theory of sexual selection that underlies it. We then apply this theory to business relation formation and present the results of an analysis of the co-relation of firm characteristics of those involved in customer-supplier relations using the IMP 2 European data base. Finally, future research opportunities are considered regarding this novel and exciting area of research. An ode to mating!

5|$|On 21 October 2013, Grabner was {{suspended}} for two games for an illegal check {{to the head of}} Carolina Hurricanes forward Nathan Gerbe. Later that season, on February 27, 2014, Grabner accomplished a rare feat, scoring two short handed goals on the same penalty kill in a 5-4 overtime win over the Toronto Maple Leafs, scoring both goals in a span of 46 seconds; Grabner became the first player to score two shorthanded goals on the same penalty kill since Ryan O'Reilly <b>did</b> <b>it</b> on February 2, 2010. However, O'Reilly scored two on a four-minute penalty kill, while Grabner <b>did</b> <b>it</b> during a standard two minute penalty.|$|E

5|$|As a diplodocid, it is {{probable}} that Dinheirosaurus possessed a whip-tail. If it <b>did,</b> <b>it</b> is likely that its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with supersonic speed.
