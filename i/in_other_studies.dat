Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males, but this distinction is not observed <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies.</b> Closer examination of sexually mature specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|E
5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children who watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children who watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children who watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E

25|$|A {{group of}} three young men in their twenties: Martin Buber of Vienna, student of {{philosophy}} and Zionist; Berthold Feiwel of Berlin – political writer and editor and Chaim Weizmann – formed a caucus emphasizing {{the need for a}} Jewish university with a first objective of education in technology. They produced a document pointing out the difficulties of Jewish youth who sought admission to universities where they lived. The lack of opportunities for technical studies, they wrote, was much more serious for Jewish students than <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies.</b> The problem was “eminiently economic and social”. It meant that in Russia, the Jews were practically excluded from technical professions with the result that they were pushed into commercial occupations.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} these {{homeotic}} genes determine an organ’s identity becomes evident when a gene that represents a particular function, for example the A gene, is not expressed. In Arabidopsis this loss results in a flower which is composed of one verticil of carpels, another containing stamens and another of carpels. This method for studying gene function uses reverse genetics techniques to produce transgenic plants that contain a mechanism for gene silencing through RNA interference. <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies,</b> using forward genetics techniques such as genetic mapping, it is {{the analysis of the}} phenotypes of flowers with structural anomalies that leads to the cloning of the gene of interest.

25|$|The Generalized Born (GB) model {{augmented}} {{with the}} hydrophobic solvent accessible surface area (SA) term is GBSA. It {{is among the}} most commonly used implicit solvent model combinations. The use of this model in the context of molecular mechanics is termed MM/GBSA. Although this formulation has been shown to successfully identify the native states of short peptides with well-defined tertiary structure, the conformational ensembles produced by GBSA models <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> differ significantly from those produced by explicit solvent and do not identify the protein's native state. In particular, salt bridges are overstabilized, possibly due to insufficient electrostatic screening, and a higher-than-native alpha helix population was observed. Variants of the GB model have also been developed to approximate the electrostatic environment of membranes, which have had some success in folding the transmembrane helixes of integral membrane proteins.|$|E
25|$|Many tumors express {{mutations}}. These mutations potentially {{create new}} targetable antigens (neoantigens) {{for use in}} T cell immunotherapy. The presence of CD8+ T cells in cancer lesions, as identified using RNA sequencing data, is higher in tumors with a high mutational burden. The level of transcripts associated with cytolytic activity of natural killer cells and T cells positively correlates with mutational load in many human tumors. In non–small cell lung cancer patients treated with lambrolizumab, mutational load shows a strong correlation with clinical response. In melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, long-term benefit is also associated with a higher mutational load, although less significantly. The predicted MHC binding neoantigens in patients with a long-term clinical benefit were enriched {{for a series of}} tetrapeptide motifs that were not found in tumors of patients with no or minimal clinical benefit. However, human neoantigens identified <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> do not show the bias toward tetrapeptide signatures.|$|E
25|$|It is a predatory species, {{with several}} studies {{conducted}} to determine its diet and feeding habits. A study in the Cape Blanc region found Branchiostoma lanceolatum (a cephalochordate), euphausiids, small fish and other small crustaceans were the predominantly taken food items, with a surprising absence of copepods which other small species {{included in the study}} did take. This lack of copepods in the false scad's diet was also noticed in an earlier similar study, which looked at the diet of slightly smaller fish. A much later study in the same location found similar results, with fish being the most common prey followed by crustaceans including shrimps and mysids, molluscs and annelids. There is a change in the diet of the species as it grows, with one study finding 23 to 30cm long fish took Branchiostoma lanceolatum predominantly, 30 to 35cm fish took euphausiids and mysids, while 35 to 55cm fish consumed small fishes of the families Maurolicidae and Carangidae predominantly. A similar pattern has been seen <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies,</b> with a general pattern of decreasing amounts of crustaceans and increasing amounts of small fish consumed as the fish grows. Seasonal variation in prey items is also known, with crustaceans dominating the diet during autumn and winter, while small fish are more frequently taken in summer. The feeding intensity of the species is lowest during the winter months, with the species feeding predominantly around mid day, and not at all during the night.|$|E
