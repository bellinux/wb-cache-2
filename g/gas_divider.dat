40|$|An {{experimental}} {{determination of the}} optical transmission of Corning 7940 UV and Suprasil I fused silica has been made. The LeRC dynamitron provided the equivalent ionizing radiation and high temperature that the transparent <b>gas</b> <b>divider</b> of an operating nuclear light bulb engine would experience. The irradiation induced absorption was measured at 2150 A, 2700 A, and 4500 A. The length of the irradiations were sufficient so that an equilibrium between radiation induced coloration and high temperature annealing was reached. The experimental results indicate a significant optical absorption, particularly at the shorter wavelength, which would make the use of fused silica in this concept questionable...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{tissue culture}} is a very {{important}} technique {{for the development of the}} orchids industry. In order to enhance the quality of the plantlets, the microclimate in the culture vessel needs to be detected. An in situ, real time and continuous measurement system of in vitro plant tissue culture is very useful to study the physiological functions and factors affecting quality. In this study, some sensing elements are adapted to measure the variations of air temperature, oxygen (O- 2) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations in the culture vessel. These gas sensors were calibrated by a <b>gas</b> <b>divider.</b> All sensing elements are kept in a clean condition by alcohol wiping and ultra-violet light exposure. The trend of O- 2 and CO 2 concentrations all indicate the validity and adequacy of this measuring system. All sensors can be maintained in good condition for the duration of long-term measurements. This technique provides a novel way to study the physiological functions of plants in vitro. (c) 2006 IAgrE. All rights reserved Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|DE 102009015737 A 1 UPAB: 20101019 NOVELTY - The {{magnetron}} coating module (100) comprises a coating source (2), {{a rotating}} target as auxiliary substrate arranged between a first coating source and a magnetron (5, 6), where the rotating target forms cathode of the magnetron, and/or a <b>gas</b> space <b>divider</b> (4) arranged {{between the first}} coating source and the coating area. The surface of the rotating target consists of carbon or carbon-containing material deposited in slight mass on a substrate (1) during sputtering. The material of the carrier is a material with slight sputtering rate. The first coating source is a planar magnetron. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method {{for the production of}} a substrate with a magnetron-coating module. USE - Magnetron coating module useful for the production of optical coatings for applications in optics and optoelectronics. ADVANTAGE - The magnetron coating module ensures simple and efficient production of high-quality optical coatings...|$|R
