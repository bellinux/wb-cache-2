5|$|During {{the trek}} towards the Black Sun, Cole is injured by {{entities}} and Ryan sacrifices his own safety to keep Jodie alive. Eventually, Jodie confronts Nathan near the Black Sun. He commits suicide to reunite with his family. As Jodie shuts down the condenser, {{she has a}} vision—Aiden is her stillborn twin brother. Jodie must make a choice: {{go back to the}} world of the living, or <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Infraworld and be reunited with everyone she has lost. By the story's end, the Infraworld has become a widespread threat in the not-so-distant future. Jodie prepares to confront the threat.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Bradley {{had sent}} two {{armoured}} combat commands against the German southern (left) flank. On 8 August, {{one of these}} (from the U.S. 2nd Armored Division) was attacking {{the rear of the}} two SS Panzer Divisions. Although fighting would continue around Mortain for several more days, there was no further prospect of any German success. The Germans issued orders to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defensive along the entire front, but poorly communicated orders resulted in this being impossible to achieve, with some German forces retreating, and others preparing to hold their ground.|$|E
5|$|His initial posting to the Pacific Theater {{was delayed}} by a month, {{during which he}} {{completed}} further training on the Cessna AT-17 Bobcat. By virtue of this additional training, and because Roddenberry's height made it unlikely {{that he would be}} suitable for a combat fighter pilot, he was assigned to bombers. He received orders to report to Bellows Field, Oahu, to join the 394th Bomb Squadron, 5th Bombardment Group, of the Thirteenth Air Force. The squadron flew the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, which had previously been used by the 19th Bomb Group, and were en route to a maintenance overhaul when they had to flee due to the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. Roddenberry was assigned as Captain William Ripley's co-pilot for the flight that the squadron took to Christmas Island, and the following day to Canton Island. An additional flight on November 17 took the squadron to Nadi, Fiji, where they were expected to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New Hebrides. Instead they were ordered to remain in Nadi to fly reconnaissance missions.|$|E

The next 16 eligible teams compete in a single Division 2 Playoff Tournament, with the winner crowned the Division 2 champion.|$|E
25|$|His brief {{experience}} of the first-class game {{was something of a}} disaster: Yorkshire, who would <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> County Championship title, crushed their opponents by an innings and 220 runs inside two days, while Bunting himself made 1 and 0 with his four overs of leg-spin disappearing for 38 runs.

25|$|The Rams {{won their}} three home games rather easily {{including}} a surprise 34–8 win over glamour side Leeds, but only managed {{to win one}} of their games in England against Oldham leaving them in third place in their pool.

Elementary and middle school students attend a particular school based on their residence within the district.

25|$|Animal mummification {{originated}} in ancient Egypt. They mummified various animals. It {{was an enormous}} part of Egyptian culture, not only in their role as food and pets, but also for religious reasons. They were typically mummified for four main purposes—to allow beloved pets to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> afterlife, to provide food in the afterlife, to act as offerings to a particular god, and because some were seen as physical manifestations of specific gods that the Egyptians worshipped. Bast, the cat goddess {{is an example of}} one such deity.|$|E

The Leinster and Munster champions advance directly to the All-Ireland semi-finals.

25|$|In their {{qualifying}} {{group for}} the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Greek side {{failed to make the}} grade, finishing fourth in a tough group which saw Ukraine advance as group winner and Turkey <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> play-off. The team returned to success though by qualifying for Euro 2008, ending the qualifying stage with the highest points total of any team and ensuring {{they would be able to}} defend their title. On 30 March 2008, Rehhagel extended his contract with Greece until 2010. The Euro 2008 ended in disappointment after three group stage losses against Sweden, Russia, and eventual winners Spain.|$|E

Bond's yacht, Australia II, designed by Ben Lexcen, skippered by John Bertrand, and representing the Royal Perth Yacht Club, easily won the Louis Vuitton challenger series, and Dennis Conner in Liberty was selected for the Cup defense.|$|E

25|$|If {{the claim}} is {{accepted}} then the maximum Oyster fare minus {{the cost of the}} journey will be refunded. The user will be asked to nominate and make a journey from a specific Tube, DLR, London Overground or National Rail station, or Tram stop. On touching in or out, the refund is loaded to the card. The only way to collect a refund is as part of an actual journey, otherwise a further penalty fare is charged. This is because when the passenger touches the reader with their Oyster card, not only will the refund <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> card, but a new journey will start.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of the current format, which now has a fifth place match and a place for the host nation's national league champions, the format slightly changed. There are now four stages: the play-off round, the quarter-final round, the semi-final round and the final. The first stage pits the host nation's national league champions against the Oceanian Champions League winners. The winner of that stage would go on the quarter-finals to join the African Champions League winners, the AFC Champions League winners and the CONCACAF Champions League winners. The winners of those games would <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> semi-finals to play the UEFA Champions League winners and South America's Copa Libertadores winners. The winners of each semi-final play each other in the final.|$|E
25|$|The {{early history}} of both clubs are intertwined, with West Ham {{initially}} coming out on top {{in a number of}} meetings between the two teams as part of a budding and friendly local rivalry (even momentarily ground sharing when made homeless the following year) but eventually resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later turned down joining the fledgling Football League only to see West Ham <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s (rumoured to be 1926), the rivalry was supposedly spiced up during strike action made by East End companies (perceived to be West Ham fans) that Isle of Dogs-based companies (i.e., Millwall fans) refused to support breeding ill will between the two camps. The rivalry remains pronounced to this day.|$|E
