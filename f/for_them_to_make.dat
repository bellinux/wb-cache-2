5|$|In Grenland, the {{metropolitan}} area surrounding Skien, {{there was a lot}} of opposition to the airline, and several local businesspeople claimed that it would be better if Norsk Air was awarded the contract, or Skien Airport was closed and locals instead used the nearby Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Norsk Air stated that it would not be possible <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money on the Skien–Oslo route; despite that, it operated from Skien to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Stavanger Airport, Sola. In 1993, Norsk Air announced that it would no longer fly from Skien, and would focus all their operations at Sandefjord. Teddy Air subsequently took over the Stavanger route, while the Bergen route was granted to Air Stord, despite Teddy Air having applied for the concession. In 1994, the company had a revenue of NOK7.5 million, and a NOK1 million profit.|$|E

Children and adolescents are still developing physically and mentally making it difficult <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> informed decisions and give consent for surgical treatments. Bariatric surgery in youth is among the controversial topics related to surgery in children.|$|E
25|$|A poor {{start to}} 2010 when the club lost six out its first seven games the team finally {{abandoned}} the cluster {{for a more}} precision kicking style. The change resulted in eleven wins, only three losses and a draw followed, and it was enough <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the finals, finishing seventh and drawing an away final against the Fremantle Dockers in Perth, which they lost by 30 points. The Hawks bolstered ranks by bringing in out of favour North Melbourne forward/ruck David Hale during the trade period.|$|E
5|$|Children, ages 11–17, {{volunteer}} to become altar servers {{not only to}} serve the church {{but also because it}} has always been looked upon as an honor. It is a chance for children to serve their priest and become closer to Jesus by being on the altar. In addition, it is an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> themselves more holy and therefore more worthy of the position.|$|R

50|$|Two French inventors, Louis Ducos du Hauron and Charles Cros, working {{unknown to}} each other during the 1860s, famously {{unveiled}} their nearly identical ideas {{on the same day}} in 1869.

25|$|Despite the {{suggested}} model, research advises {{that the process}} of self-forgiveness is not always applicable for every individual. For example, individuals who have not actually caused others any harm or wrongdoing, but instead are suffering from negative emotions such as self-hatred or self-pity, such as victims of assault, might attempt self-forgiveness for their perceived offences. However, this would not be the process necessary <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their amends. Additionally, offenders who continue to offend others while attempting to forgive themselves for past offences demonstrate a reluctance to genuinely complete the four stages necessary for self-forgiveness. Research suggests {{that it is important to}} first gather exterior information about the individual's perceived offences as well as their needs and motivation for self-forgiveness.|$|E
25|$|As the Australians {{began their}} innings, {{it was clear}} that not enough time {{remained}} <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up the 341 runs by which they trailed. Almost immediately they were offered the light; and having accepted it, both teams had to return to the dressing rooms to wait for a formal finish. The situation became somewhat farcical. With the match effectively over, the crowd were eager for the Ashes to be presented to England, and the celebrations to begin. After a period of some uncertainty and confusion, at 18:17 BST umpires Koertzen and Bowden removed the bails and pulled up the stumps to signal the end of the match. With no result in this fifth and final Test, England took the series 2–1, regaining the Ashes {{for the first time since}} 1987.|$|E
25|$|Teddy Air was {{established}} in 1989 and began services from Skien to Fornebu the following year, initially using a Britten-Norman Islander. There {{was a lot of}} local opposition to the airline, and several local businesspeople claimed {{that it would be better}} if Norsk Air was awarded the contract, or Skien Airport was closed and locals instead used Sandefjord Airport. Norsk Air stated that it would not be possible <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money on the Skien–Oslo route; Widerøe chose to operate out of Sandefjord and from 1993 closed its operations at Geiteryggen. Teddy Air subsequently took over the Stavanger route, using an Embraer 110, while the Bergen route was granted to Air Stord, despite Teddy Air having applied for the concession. Coast Air was also awarded a concession on the route to Bergen.|$|E

25|$|Wang sent {{messengers}} issuing pardons {{in hopes}} of causing these rebels to disband. Once the messengers returned to the Xin capital Chang'an, some honestly reported that the rebels gathered because the harsh laws made it impossible <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a living and therefore {{they were forced to}} rebel. Some, in order to flatter Wang Mang, told him that these were simply evil resistors who needed to be killed, or that this was a temporary phenomenon. Wang listened to those who flattered him and generally relieved those who told the truth from their posts. Further, Wang made no further attempts to pacify the rebels, but instead decided to suppress them by force. In reality, the rebels were forced into rebellion to survive, and they were hoping that eventually, when the famine was over, they could return home to farm. As a result, they never dared to attack cities.|$|E

After a period of some uncertainty and confusion, at 18:17 BST umpires Koertzen and Bowden removed the bails and pulled up the stumps to signal the end of the match.

500|$|The period {{following}} Enema of the State saw {{the band}} experience great transition. [...] "We {{had gone from}} playing small clubs and sleeping on people's floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2013. [...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying... it scared {{the shit out of}} us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't going to be out in time <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their quarterly revenue statements.

50|$|In face of {{the growing}} {{encroachment}} on potential sales from internet piracy, industry associations like the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) have lobbied for stricter laws and stricter punishment of those breaking copyright law. Record companies have also turned to technological barriers to copying, such as DRM, to some controversy. These organizations have tried to add more controls to the digital copy of the music to prevent consumers from copying the music. For the most part, the industry {{has come to a}} consensus that, if not DRM, then some similar measures are necessary <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a profit.|$|R

500|$|All We Know Is Falling was {{met with}} {{generally}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Kelley stated [...] "it's obvious that someone has done Williams wrong" [...] from the lyrics in the album's the songs, and noted its similarity to Lavigne's previous studio album Under My Skin (2004). Tony Pascarella of The Trades said that [...] "these passionate, rocking tracks are what make this Tennessee group so talented [...] Paramore is a band you may not yet have heard of, but look <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a major splash {{in the very near}} future." [...] He also praised Williams' voice as [...] "a rich, powerful voice that rarely makes a mistake on this stunning debut." [...] BuzzFeed included the album at number 13 on their [...] "36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F——ing Die" [...] list. In a tenth-anniversary review from Alternative Press, Tyler Sharp wrote that the album evolved into [...] "a scene classic" [...] after the band's gradual rise to mainstream popularity in later years.|$|E
500|$|The ten {{bases of}} merit are {{very popular in}} Buddhist countries. In China, other similar lists are also well-known. In Thai Buddhism, the word [...] "merit" [...] (...) is often {{combined}} with [...] "to do, to make" [...] (...) , and this expression is frequently used, especially in relation to giving. In Buddhist societies, such merit-making is common, especially those meritorious deeds which are connected to monks and temples. In this regard, there is a saying in Burma, [...] "Your hands are always close to offering donations". Contrary to popular conceptions, merit-making is done by both monastics and laypeople alike. Buddhist monks or lay Buddhists earn merit through mindfulness, meditation, chanting and other rituals. Giving is the fundamental way of making merit for many laypeople, as monks {{are not allowed to}} cook by themselves. Monastics in their turn practice themselves to be a good field of merit and make merit by teaching the donors. Merit-making has thus created a symbiotic relationship between laypeople and Sangha, and the Sangha is obligated to be accessible to laypeople, <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> merit.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was soon}} {{realised}} {{after the opening}} of the Nelson – Foxhill section that the inconvenience of transferring goods traffic from trains to drays to transfer it to the port at Nelson station was sufficient enough for many merchants in Nelson and surrounding areas to avoid the railway altogether and to ship their goods directly to the port by road.

2500|$|Confederate raiders under General John B. Magruder burnt {{the nearby}} town of Hampton, Virginia on August 7, 1861, but the [...] "contraband" [...] blacks {{occupied}} its ruins.

Many worked for the Army at a rate of $10.00/month, but these wages were not sufficient <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> major improvements in housing. Conditions in The Camp grew worse, and Northern humanitarian groups sought to intervene on behalf of its 64,000 residents. Captain C. B. Wilder was appointed to organize a response.

[...] Metal Hammer noted Death Magnetics [...] "sharp riffs" [...] and [...] "uncharacteristic bouncing grooves", and favorably compares the band's sound on the album to bands like Slayer, Led Zeppelin and Rage Against the Machine. Former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy has praised the album, saying [...] "Death Magnetic is hands down the best Metallica album in 20 years.

2500|$|Grace and {{his brother}} Fred faced {{financial}} difficulty after their father died in December 1871 as they were still living with their mother who had been left just enough to retain the family home. As medical students, they faced considerable outlay {{in addition to their}} living expenses and it became imperative <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> what they could out of cricket, especially the United South of England Eleven. Grace as its match organiser had to find gaps in the first-class fixture list and then pull together a team to visit a location where a suitable profit could be made. It has been estimated that the standard fee paid to the USEE was £100 for a three-day match with £5 each going to the nine professionals in the team and the other £45 to W. G. and Fred: a sizeable amount in 1872 when £100 was perhaps the equivalent of £3,000-plus {{at the end of the}} 20th century. Otherwise, Grace played for expenses but these were loaded as, for example, he is known to have claimed £15 per appearance for Gloucestershire and £20 for representing the Gentlemen. Although the money he was paid is [...] "small beer" [...] compared with 21st-century sports stars, there is no doubt he had a comfortable living out of cricket and made far more money than any contemporary professional. To put it in context, a domestic servant earned less than £50 a year.|$|E
