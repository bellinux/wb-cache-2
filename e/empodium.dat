50|$|<b>Empodium</b> is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family Hypoxidaceae, first described in 1866. It grows from a small corm which produces lance-shaped or pleated and sometimes hairy, star-shaped flowers and leaves with 10 - 30 cm long in Autumn season. The genus is native to winter-rainfall areas in South Africa, Swaziland, Lesotho, and Namibia.|$|E
50|$|Bibionidae are {{medium-sized}} flies with a {{body length}} from 4.0 to 10.0 mm. The body is black, brown, or rusty, and thickset, with thick legs. The antennae are moniliform. The front tibiae bear large strong spurs or a circlet of spines. The tarsi are five-segmented and bear tarsal claws, pulvilli, and a well developed <b>empodium.</b> The wings have two basal cells (posterior basal wing cell and basal wing cell), but are without a discoidal wing cell. R4+5 is simple or branched; at most, only three branches of R developed. The leading edge wing veins are stronger than the weak veins of the trailing edge.|$|E
5000|$|Under their pretarsi, {{members of}} the Diptera {{generally}} have paired lobes or pulvilli, meaning [...] "little cushions". There is a single pulvillus below each unguis. The pulvilli often have an arolium between them or otherwise a median bristle or <b>empodium,</b> meaning the meeting place of the pulvilli. On {{the underside of the}} tarsal segments there frequently are pulvillus-like organs or plantulae. The arolium, plantulae and pulvilli are adhesive organs enabling their possessors to climb smooth or steep surfaces. They all are outgrowths of the exoskeleton and their cavities contain blood. Their structures are covered with tubular tenent hairs, the apices of which are moistened by a glandular secretion. The organs are adapted to apply the hairs closely to a smooth surface so that adhesion occurs through surface molecular forces.|$|E
50|$|Adult tabanids {{are large}} flies with {{prominent}} compound eyes, short antennae composed of three segments, and wide bodies. In females, {{the eyes are}} widely separated but in males they are almost touching; they are often patterned and brightly coloured in life but appear dull in preserved specimens. The terminal segment of the antennae is pointed and is annulated, appearing to {{be made up of}} several tapering rings. There are no hairs or arista arising from the antennae. Both head and thorax are clad in short hairs but there are no bristles on the body. The membranous forewings are clear, uniformly shaded grey or brown, or patterned in some species; they have a basal lobe (or calypter) that covers the modified knob-like hindwings or halteres. The tips of the legs have two lobes on the sides (pulvilli) and a central lobe or <b>empodium</b> in addition to two claws that enable them to grip surfaces. Species recognition is based on details of head structures (antennae, frons, and maxillae), the wing venation and the body patterning; minute variations of surface structure cause subtle alterations of the overlying hairs which alters the appearance of the body.|$|E
5000|$|Legs are femoral {{attachment}} of mid trochanter transverse {{or slightly}} oblique. Mesotrochanter is not reduced or concealed from below. Metafemur not much wider than mesofemur. Mesotibia not strongly widened, or strongly widened, widest {{at or near}} apex. Outer edge of mesotibia simple, [...] or , or with distinct teeth or long spines. Outer subapical edge of mesotibia without antenna cleaner. Preapical surfaces of mesotibia without ridges or combs. Outer apical angle of mesotibia simple or slightly produced, without lobe, teeth or spines, or with rounded lobe or process, sometimes bearing spines. Mesotibial spurs are eirher glabrous or absent. Mesotarsus with 5 distinct tarsomeres (pentamerous). Tarsomeres on hind leg at least as many as on mid leg. Tarsomeres on fore leg at least as many as on mid leg. Mesotarsomere 1 well developed and visible. Preapical mesotarsomeres together longer than apical one. Penultimate mesotarsomere not distinctly shorter than antepenultimate. Ventral mesotarsal lobes are absent while mesotarsal claws are paired; subequal in length and similar in form and angle of inclination; simple. Appendage on each tarsal claw absent. Mesotarsal claws without setae near base. Mesotarsal <b>empodium</b> absent or with 2 or fewer setae. Inner subapical edge of protibia without antenna cleaner. Hind legs without swimming hairs. Preapical surfaces of metatibia without ridges or combs.|$|E

40|$|The {{inflorescence}} {{and flowers}} of representatives of Spiloxene, Pauridia and  <b>Empodium</b> were studied. The inflorescence shows a reduction from a several-flowered umbel {{to a single}} flower. The anthers are non-versatile in all three genera, unlike those of Hypoxis and  Rhodohypoxis. In  Spiloxene and Pauridia the ovary is 3 -locular with axile placentation, while in  <b>Empodium</b> it is unilocular with three parietal placentas. The floral vascular anatomy of the three genera is described and the generic differences pointed out. The close relationship between Spiloxene and  Pauridia is demonstrated and the inclusion of  Pauridia in the Hypoxidaceae is supported. Spiloxene is regarded as generically distinct from Hypoxis. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{leaf and}} corm {{morphology}} and anatomy of {{representatives of the}} genera  Spiloxene, Pauridia and <b>Empodium</b> were studied. The corms are annual and tunicated, except in the group Aquaticae of Spiloxene. They are swollen stems consisting {{of a number of}} internodes. In Spiloxene and Pauridia the roots grow {{from the base of the}} corm, while in <b>Empodium</b> they develop from the sides. The epidermis of the older corms is replaced by several layers of thin-walled cork. Characters of the corm coverings are used to divide  Spiloxene into six groups. Four leaf forms are recognised namely carinate, terete, canaliculate and plicate. Multicellular processes and unicellular hairs occur occasionally. The leaf stomata are paracytic. Most species have mucilage canals containing pectic compounds of mucopoly­saccharides. The vascular bundles have complete or incomplete bundle sheaths and larger bundles have sclerenchyma caps. <br /...|$|E
