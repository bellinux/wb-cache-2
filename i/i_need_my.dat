[...] "Skew It On the Bar-B" [...] {{is followed by the}} title track, which has been compared to the music of soul singer Isaac Hayes.

[...] "Synthesizer" [...] contains elements of electrofunk and features funk musician George Clinton. Emma Warren of The Guardian called the track [...] "raw and woozy", dubbing it the [...] "weirdest moment of the record". On the seventh track, [...] "Slump", Big Boi is joined by two members of the Dungeon Family as they describe their experiences selling dope. One of the few tracks that doesn’t have Andre on it, since he is the [...] "unique" [...] one of the group, while Big Boi is more of the traditional gangster. On [...] "West Savannah", Big Boi discusses his Southern roots, and references individuals who grew up outside of the South who fail to recognize different regional Southern identities by stating [...] "You might call us country, but we's only Southern".|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Cuccinelli stated [...] "homosexuality is wrong."

And I think in a natural law based country it’s appropriate to have policies that reflect that. ... They don’t comport with natural law.

2500|$|Hellman shot {{almost the}} entire script as written. The first cut of the film was three-and-a-half hours long.

He had control of the final cut, but was contractually obliged to deliver a film no longer than two hours. The final version ran 105 minutes. In their April 1971 cover story, Esquire {{magazine}} proclaimed Two-Lane Blacktop, [...] "film of the year". Hellman initially thought that the Esquire article would be good publicity for the film, but in hindsight was not, because [...] "I think it raised people's expectations. They couldn't accept the movie for what it was". There {{was a lot of}} advance buzz about the film, but Lew Wasserman, head of the studio saw the film and hated it. He refused to promote it and when it opened in New York City on the Fourth of July weekend, there were no newspaper ads promoting it.|$|E
