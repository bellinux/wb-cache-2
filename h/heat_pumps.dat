40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades there has been nearly {{exponential}} growth in drying R&D on a global scale. Improving of the drying operation to save energy, improve product quality as well as reduce environmental effect remained as the main objectives of any development of drying system. A solar assisted chemical <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> dryer is a new solar drying system, which have contributed to better cost-effectiveness and better quality dried products as well as saving energy. A solar collector is adapted to provide thermal energy in a reactor so a chemical reaction can take place. This reduces the dependency of the drying technology on fossil energy for heating. In this paper a review on advanced of solar assisted chemical <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> dryer is presented (the system model and the results from experimental studies on the system performance are discussed).

5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. <b>Heat</b> <b>pumps</b> can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 {{an appeal}} to raise £3 million was {{launched}} to restore the pools. The fundraising has been supported by The Prince's Trust. The project aims not just to preserve the existing architecture, but also to reopen it as an outdoor lido. This is hampered by poor access to the site {{and the possibility of}} flooding. It is intended to make the work sustainable and environmentally friendly, with renewable sources of energy including water source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> using latent heat from the River Avon. A small landing stage is being proposed to enable access to the pools from river craft.|$|E
5|$|The Energy Savings Trust has {{estimated}} that micro-generation could provide a significantly increased proportion of the UK's electricity demand by 2050 although {{only a fraction of}} this would come from renewable sources. The current Scottish output is negligible. In May 2006 the then Communities Minister Malcolm Chisholm launched a Planning Advice Note aimed at promoting micro-renewables. Small-scale 'wind2heat' projects, which use wind turbines to power electrical storage heaters directly, have proven to be successful in remoter rural areas; as have various other local schemes such as air source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|E

The mathematical {{model of the}} unit is established and two hybrid operating conditions of the system are simulated. The simulative studying results shows that in winter the solar assisted air source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> unit can make full use of solar energy and the coefficient of performance (COP) of air source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> can be improved. In summer the cooling heat of air source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> could be recovered to improve the stability of solar hot water collector and the COP of the air source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> unit is greatly improved.

40|$|Abstract. Composition and {{operating}} modes {{of two different}} solar-assisted <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> systems have been introduced in this paper.

5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{electrical}} plant {{construction and}} well drilling cost about €2–5million perMW of electrical capacity, while the break–even price is 0.04–0.10€ perkW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems {{tend to be}} on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4million perMW and break–even above $0.054 perkW·h in 2007. Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> with a capacity of 10kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 perkilowatt. District heating systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The capital cost of one such district heating system in Bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1million€ perMW. Direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs perkW·h, but they must consume electricity to run pumps and compressors. Some governments subsidize geothermal projects.|$|E
25|$|According to the US EPA, {{geothermal}} <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> {{can reduce}} energy consumption up to 44% compared with air-source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> {{and up to}} 72% compared with electric resistance heating.

30|$|The cost {{of heating}} with {{conventional}} heating equipment is generally {{greater than the}} cost of heating with a <b>heat</b> <b>pump.</b> However, the typical method of control–balanced—often increases the cost of <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> use.

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>pump</b> {{technology}} {{has been used for}} heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning in domestic and industrial sectors in most developed countries of the world including South Africa. However, <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> drying (HPD) of fruits and vegetables has been largely unexploited in South Africa and by extension to the sub-Saharan African region. Although studies on <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> drying started in South Africa several years ago, not much progress has been recorded to date.

25|$|Air-air <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> that extract {{heat from}} outside air and {{transfer}} this heat to inside air, {{are the most}} common type of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> and the cheapest.

However, ground-water <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are more efficient than air-water <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> and therefore they are often the better choice for providing heat for the floor heating and domestic hot water systems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>pumps</b> may obtain {{low-grade heat}} from the outdoor air in mild climates. In areas with average winter {{temperatures}} well below freezing, ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are more efficient than air-source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> because they can extract residual solar heat stored in the ground at warmer temperatures than is available from cold air. According to the US EPA, geothermal <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> can reduce energy consumption up to 44% compared with air source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> and up to 72% compared with electric resistance heating. The high purchase price of a heat pump vs resistance heaters may be offset when air conditioning is also needed.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{concluded}} that <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are the single technology that {{could reduce the}} greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that {{is available on the}} market. With a market share of 30% and (potentially) clean electricity, <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> could reduce global CO2 emissions by 8% annually. Using ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> could reduce around 60% of the primary energy demand and 90% of CO2 emissions in Europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier. Using surplus renewable energy in <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion.|$|E
