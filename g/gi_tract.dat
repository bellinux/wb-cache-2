25|$|Gastro-intestinal {{reactions}} can {{be due to}} malabsorption {{or other}} <b>GI</b> <b>Tract</b> abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} is symptomatic and largely {{the same as}} with diclofenac. However, the possibility of severe <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> symptoms should be particularly noted.|$|E
25|$|Other animals {{including}} amphibians, birds, reptiles, and egg-laying mammals have a {{major difference}} in their <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> in that it ends in a cloaca and not an anus.|$|E
25|$|Fecaliths {{are hard}} {{formations}} of ingest that obstruct the <b>GI</b> <b>tract,</b> and may require surgery to resolve. These are most commonly seen in miniature horses, ponies, and foals.|$|E
25|$|Various {{pathogens}} {{can cause}} gastroenteritis an {{inflammation of the}} stomach and small intestine. These can include those organisms that cause foodborne illnesses. Gastroenteritis is the most common disease of the <b>GI</b> <b>tract.</b>|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{reserpine}} has {{a peripheral}} action {{in many parts}} of the body, resulting in a preponderance of the effects of the cholinergic part of the autonomous nervous system on the <b>GI</b> <b>tract,</b> smooth muscles, blood vessels, etc.|$|E
25|$|Recommended {{laboratory}} blood testing includes: cross-matching blood, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, coagulation time, and electrolytes. If {{the ratio}} of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine is greater than 30 the source is more likely from the upper <b>GI</b> <b>tract.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> {{releases}} hormones from enzymes to help {{regulate the}} digestive process. These hormones, including gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin, and ghrelin, are mediated through either intracrine or autocrine mechanisms, {{indicating that the}} cells releasing these hormones are conserved structures throughout evolution.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> and the {{accessory}} organs of digestion (pancreas, liver, gall bladder) {{are responsible for}} more cancers and more deaths from cancer than any other system in the body. There is significant geographic variation in the rates of different gastrointestinal cancers.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s, Dr. Jonathon E. Rhoads of the Department of Surgery (which {{he would later}} go on to head for many years), mentored Dr. Stanley Dudrick who pioneered the {{successful}} use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for patients unable to tolerate nutrition through their <b>GI</b> <b>tract.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{overdose}} on TCA {{is especially}} fatal {{as it is}} rapidly absorbed from the <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> in the alkaline conditions of the small intestines. As a result, toxicity often becomes apparent in the first hour after an overdose. However, symptoms may take several hours to appear if a mixed overdose has caused delayed gastric emptying.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{study by}} Witting, the strongest {{predictors}} were of an upper GI bleed are black stool, age <50 years, and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio 30 or more. Out of 325 persons studied, seven (5%) of 151 with none of these factors had an upper <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> bleed, versus 63 (93%) of 68 with 2 or 3 factors.|$|E
25|$|There are {{additional}} {{factors contributing to}} protection from pathogen invasion. For example, low pH (ranging from 1 to 4) of the stomach is fatal for many microorganisms that enter it. Similarly, mucus (containing IgA antibodies) neutralizes many pathogenic microorganisms. Other factors in the <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> contribution to immune function include enzymes secreted in the saliva and bile.|$|E
25|$|The whole human <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> {{is about}} nine metres (30 feet) long at autopsy. It is {{considerably}} shorter {{in the living}} body because the intestines, which are tubes of smooth muscle tissue, maintain constant muscle tone, somewhat like a Slinky that maintains itself in a halfway-tense state but can relax in spots to allow for local distention, peristalsis, and so on.|$|E
25|$|Intraperitoneal {{parts of}} the <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> are covered with serosa. These include most of the stomach, {{first part of the}} duodenum, all of the small intestine, caecum and appendix, {{transverse}} colon, sigmoid colon and rectum. In these sections of the gut there is clear boundary between the gut and the surrounding tissue. These {{parts of the}} tract have a mesentery.|$|E
25|$|Protein {{malnutrition}} {{is a real}} risk. Some patients suffer troublesome vomiting after surgery, {{until their}} <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> adjusts to the changes, and cannot eat adequate amounts even with 6 meals a day. Many patients require protein supplementation during the early phases of rapid weight loss to prevent excessive loss of muscle mass. Hair loss is also a risk of protein malnutrition.|$|E
25|$|The coordinated contractions {{of these}} layers is called {{peristalsis}} and propels the food through the tract. Food in the <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> {{is called a}} bolus (ball of food) from the mouth down to the stomach. After the stomach, the food is partially digested and semi-liquid, and {{is referred to as}} chyme. In the large intestine the remaining semi-solid substance is referred to as faeces.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} sugars, sucrose is digested into its {{components}} via the enzyme sucrase to glucose (blood sugar) and fructose. The glucose component is transported {{into the blood}} (90%) and excess glucose is converted to temporary storage in the liver– named glycogen. The fructose is either bonded to cellulose and transported out the <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> or processed by the liver into citrates, aldehydes, and, for the most part, lipid droplets (fat).|$|E
25|$|Orlistat {{works by}} {{inhibiting}} gastric and pancreatic lipases, the enzymes that break down triglycerides in the intestine. When lipase activity is blocked, triglycerides from the diet are not hydrolyzed into absorbable free fatty acids, and instead are excreted unchanged. Only trace amounts of orlistat are absorbed systemically; the primary effect is local lipase inhibition within the <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> after an oral dose. The primary route of elimination {{is through the}} feces.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the {{sorbitol}} added to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS, used {{in the treatment of}} hyperkalemia) can cause complications in the <b>GI</b> <b>tract,</b> including bleeding, perforated colonic ulcers, ischemic colitis and colonic necrosis, particularly in patients with uremia. Risk factors for sorbitol-induced damage include immunosuppression, hypovolemia, postoperative setting, hypotension after hemodialysis, and peripheral vascular disease. SPS-sorbitol should therefore be used carefully in the management of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract (digestive tract, digestional tract, <b>GI</b> <b>tract,</b> GIT, gut, or alimentary canal) is an organ system within humans {{and other animals}} which takes in food, digests it to extract and absorb energy and nutrients, and expels the remaining waste as feces. The mouth, oesophagus, stomach, and intestines {{are part of the}} {{gastrointestinal tract}}. Gastrointestinal is an adjective meaning of or pertaining to the stomach and intestines. A tract is a collection of related anatomic structures or a series of connected body organs.|$|E
25|$|Ingestion of ricin causes pain, inflammation, and {{hemorrhage}} in the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal system. Gastrointestinal symptoms quickly {{progress to}} severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Hemorrhage causes bloody feces (melena) and vomiting blood (hematemesis). The low blood volume (hypovolemia) caused by gastrointestinal fluid loss {{can lead to}} organ failure in the pancreas, kidney, liver, and <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> and progress to shock. Shock and organ failure are indicated by disorientation, stupor, weakness, drowsiness, excessive thirst (polydipsia), low urine production (oliguria), and bloody urine (hematuria).|$|E
25|$|Plants make {{cholesterol}} in {{very small}} amounts. Plants manufacture phytosterols (substances chemically similar to cholesterol), which {{can compete with}} cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption. When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the <b>GI</b> <b>tract,</b> an important protective mechanism. The intake of naturally occurring phytosterols, which encompass plant sterols and stanols, ranges between ~200–300mg/day depending on eating habits. Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700mg/day.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy and {{angiography}} {{are special}} applications of X-ray imaging, {{in which a}} fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system. This allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a radiocontrast agent. Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting {{into the body of}} the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the genitourinary system, or the gastrointestinal tract (<b>GI</b> <b>tract).</b> Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the <b>GI</b> <b>tract.</b> Iodine, in multiple proprietary forms, is given by oral, rectal, intra-arterial or intravenous routes. These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the real-time imaging, allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities (tumors, cysts, inflammation) more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air {{can be used as a}} contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system; in these cases, the contrast agent attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation along any {{portion of}} the <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> can lead to colic. This leads to pain and {{possibly}} stasis of peristalsis (Ileus), which can cause excessive accumulation of fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. This is a functional rather than mechanical blockage of the intestine, but like the mechanical blockage seen with simple obstructions, it can have serious effects including severe dehydration. Inflammation of the bowel may lead to increased permeability and subsequent endotoxemia. The underlying cause of inflammation {{may be due to}} infection, toxin, or trauma, and may require special treatment in order to resolve the colic.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal cancer {{refers to}} {{malignant}} {{conditions of the}} gastrointestinal tract (<b>GI</b> <b>tract)</b> and accessory organs of digestion, including the esophagus, stomach, biliary system, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus. The symptoms relate to the organ affected and can include obstruction (leading to difficulty swallowing or defecating), abnormal bleeding or other associated problems. The diagnosis often requires endoscopy, followed by biopsy of suspicious tissue. The treatment depends on {{the location of the}} tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and whether it has invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere. These factors also determine the prognosis.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 20,000 protein coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and 75% of these genes {{are expressed in}} {{at least one of the}} different parts of the digestive organ system. Over 600 of these genes are more specifically expressed in one or more parts of the <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> and the corresponding proteins have functions related to digestion of food and uptake of nutrients. Examples of specific proteins with such functions are pepsinogen PGC and the lipase LIPF, expressed in chief cells, and gastric ATPase ATP4A and gastric intrinsic factor GIF, expressed in parietal cells of the stomach mucosa. Specific proteins expressed in the stomach and duodenum involved in defence include mucin proteins, such as mucin 6 and intelectin-1.|$|E
25|$|Lymph vessels called lacteals {{are in the}} {{beginning}} of the gastrointestinal tract, predominantly in the small intestine. While most other nutrients absorbed by the small intestine are passed on to the portal venous system to drain via the portal vein into the liver for processing, fats (lipids) are passed on to the lymphatic system to be transported to the blood circulation via the thoracic duct. (There are exceptions, for example medium-chain triglycerides are fatty acid esters of glycerol that passively diffuse from the <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> to the portal system.) The enriched lymph originating in the lymphatics of the small intestine is called chyle. The nutrients that are released to the circulatory system are processed by the liver, having passed through the systemic circulation.|$|E
25|$|Endotoxemia is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of colic and warrants aggressive treatment. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) is released from the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria when they die. Normally, endotoxin is prevented from entering systemic circulation by the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa, antibodies and enzymes which bind and neutralize it and, for the small amount that manages to enter the blood stream, removal by Kupffer cells in the liver. Endotoxemia occurs {{when there is an}} overgrowth and secondary die-off of gram negative bacteria, releasing mass quantities of endotoxin. This is especially common when the mucosal barrier is damaged, as with ischemia of the <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> secondary to a strangulating lesion or displacement. Endotoxemia produces systemic effects such as cardiovascular shock, insulin resistance, and coagulation abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Motility is {{encouraged}} {{by the use of}} prokinetic drugs such as erythromycin, metoclopramide, bethanechol and lidocaine, as well as through vigorous walking, which has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on GI motility. Lidocaine is especially useful, as it not only encourages motility, but also has anti-inflammatory properties and may ameliorate some post-operative pain. Metoclopramide has been shown to reduce reflux and hospital stay, but does has excitatory effects on the central nervous system. Anti-inflammatory drugs are used to decrease inflammation of the <b>GI</b> <b>tract,</b> which is thought to be the underlying cause of the disease, as well as to help control any absorption of LPS in cases of endotoxemia since the substance decreases motility However, care must be taken when giving these drugs, as NSAIDs have been shown to alter intestinal motility.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to fluid support, impactions are often treated with intestinal lubricants and laxatives to help move the obstruction along. Mineral oil {{is the most}} commonly used lubricant for large colon impactions, and is administered via nasogastric tube, up to 4 liters once or twice daily. It helps coat the intestine, but is not very effective for severe impactions or sand colic since it may simply bypass the obstruction. Mineral oil has the added benefit of crudely measuring GI transit time, a process which normally takes around 18 hours, since it is obvious when it is passed. The detergent dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DDS) is also commonly given in oral fluids. It is more effective in softening an impaction than mineral oil, and helps stimulate intestinal motility, but can inhibit fluid absorption from the intestine and is potentially toxic so is only given in small amounts, two separate times 48 hours apart. Epsom salts are also useful for impactions, since they act both as an osmotic agent, to increase fluid in the <b>GI</b> <b>tract,</b> and as a laxative, but do run the risk of dehydration and diarrhea. Strong laxatives are not recommended for treating impactions.|$|E
25|$|Flatus (intestinal gas) {{is mostly}} {{produced}} as {{a byproduct of}} bacterial fermentation in the gastrointestinal (<b>GI)</b> <b>tract,</b> especially the colon. There are reports of aerophagia (excessive air swallowing) causing excessive intestinal gas, but this is considered rare. Over 99% {{of the volume of}} flatus is composed of non-smelly gases. These include oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. Nitrogen is not produced in the gut, but a component of environmental air. Patients who have excessive intestinal gas that is mostly composed of nitrogen have aerophagia. Hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane are all produced in the gut and contribute 74% of the volume of flatus in normal subjects. Methane and hydrogen are flammable, and so flatus containing adequate amounts of these can be ignited. Not all humans produce flatus that contains methane. For example, in one study of the faeces of nine adults, only five of the samples contained archaea capable of producing methane. The prevalence of methane over hydrogen in human farts may correlate with obesity, constipation and irritable bowel syndrome, as archaea that oxidise hydrogen into methane promote the metabolism's ability to absorb fatty acids from food.|$|E
25|$|Olanzapine has {{a higher}} {{affinity}} for 5-HT2A serotonin receptors than D2 dopamine receptors, which is a common property of most atypical antipsychotics, aside from the benzamide antipsychotics such as amisulpride along with the non-benzamides aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, blonanserin, cariprazine, melperone and perospirone. Olanzapine also had the highest affinity of any second-generation antipsychotic towards the P-glycoprotein in one in vitro study. P-glycoprotein transports a myriad of drugs across a numerous of different biological membranes (found in numerous body systems) including the blood-brain barrier (a semi-permeable membrane which filters the contents of blood prior to it reaching the brain); P-GP inhibition could mean that less brain exposure to olanzapine results from this interaction with the P-glycoprotein. A relatively large quantity of commonly encountered foods and medications inhibit P-GP, and it is fairly common for pharmaceuticals to be either substrates of P-GP, or to inhibit its action; both substrates and inhibitors of P-GP effectively increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier to P-GP substrates and subsequently increase the central activity of the substrate while reducing the local effects on the <b>GI</b> <b>tract.</b> The mediation of olanzapine in {{the central nervous system}} by P-GP means that any other substance or drug which interacts with P-GP increases the risk for toxic accumulations of both olanzapine and the other drug.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of adhesions {{begins with}} good {{surgical}} technique to minimize {{trauma to the}} tissue and thus reparative responses by the body. Several drugs and substances are {{used to try to}} prevent adhesion formation. Preoperative use of DMSO, a free radical scavenger, potassium penicillin, and flunixin meglumine may be given. The thick intestinal lubricant carboxymethylcellulose is often applied to the <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> intraoperatively, to decrease trauma from handling by the surgeon and provide a physical barrier between the intestine and adjacent intestinal loops or abdominal organs. It has been shown to double the survival rate of horses, and its use is now a standard practice. Hyaluraonan {{can also be used to}} produce a physical barrier. Intraperitoneal unfractionated heparin is sometimes used, since it decreases fibrin formation and thus may decrease fibrinous adhesions. Omentectomy (removal of the omentum) is a quick, simple procedure that also greatly decreases the risk of adhesions, since the omentum is one organ that commonly adheres to the intestines. The abdomen is usually lavaged copiously before the abdomen is sutured closed, and anti-inflammatories are given postoperatively. A laparoscope may be used post-surgery to look for and break down adhesions, however there is risk of additional adhesions forming post-procedure. Encouraging motility post-surgery can also be useful, as it decreases the contact time between tissues. Adhesion-induced colic has a poor prognosis, with a 16% survival rate in one study.|$|E
500|$|On the trial's third day, {{the plaintiffs}} {{presented}} their next argument, {{which was that}} the Uhlmann paper, which had reported the presence of vaccine-strain measles virus in the <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> of children with autism, used reliable PCR techniques to detect said virus. Their witness for that day was molecular biologist Karin Hepner, who testified that [...] "...the positive and negative controls used by the Uhlmann authors [...] were appropriate, that the operating procedure employed in the testing was appropriate to minimize the possibility of [...] "contamination," [...] and that the [...] "assays" [...] utilized were appropriately selected and implemented." [...] She also contended that the two studies that had failed to replicate the Uhlmann paper's results were flawed for two reasons: because they looked at cells of children with autism rather than in their <b>GI</b> <b>tract,</b> and {{because they did not}} test children with autism with gastrointestinal dysfunction.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that cockroaches are serious vectors of disease. Cockroaches are not vagile, i.e. they do not travel far from their birthplace {{as opposed to the}} housefly which may travel miles from its birthplace. The cockroach will spread its <b>GI</b> <b>tract</b> contents throughout a building. If that is a home it will be helping to spread the diseases that the family and friends bring into the home. [...] In a hospital or a restaurant it can spread diseases from sick to well individuals. [...] They have no bite or sting. [...] It is true that by external contact that cockroaches can carry bacteria such as salmonella onto surfaces. Their shells contain a protein, arylphorin, implicated in asthma and other respiratory conditions.|$|E
