40|$|Cast {{immobilization}} of limbs causes hyperalgesia, {{which is}} a decline of the threshold of mechanical and thermal mechanical stimuli. The immobilization-induced hyperalgesia (IIH) can disturb rehabilitation and {{activities of daily living}} in patients with orthopedic disorders. However, it is unclear what therapeutic and preventive approaches can be used to alleviate IIH. Exercise that activates the descending pain modulatory system may be effective for IIH. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of treadmill exercise during the immobilization period, using the non-immobilized limbs, on IIH. Thirty-six 8 -week-old Wistar rats were randomly divided into (1) control, (2) immobilization (Im), and (3) immobilization and treadmill exercise (<b>Im.</b> +. <b>Ex)</b> groups. In the Im and <b>Im.</b> +. <b>Ex</b> groups, the right ankle joints of each rat were immobilized in full plantar flexion with a plaster cast for an 8 -week period. In the <b>Im.</b> +. <b>Ex</b> group, treadmill exercise (15. m/min, 30. min/day, 5 days/week) was administered during the immobilization period while the right hindlimb was kept immobilized. Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured using von Frey filaments every week. To investigate possible activation of the descending pain modulatory system, beta-endorphin expression levels in hypothalamus and midbrain periaqueductal gray were analyzed. Although IIH clearly occurred in the Im group, the hyperalgesia was partially but significantly reduced in the <b>Im.</b> +. <b>Ex</b> group. Beta-endorphin, which is one of the endogenous opioids, was selectively increased in the hypothalamus and midbrain periaqueductal gray of the <b>Im.</b> +. <b>Ex</b> group. Our data suggest that treadmill running using the non-immobilized limbs reduces the amount of hyperalgesia induced in the immobilized limb even if it is not freed. This ameliorating effect might be due to the descending pain modulatory system being activated by upregulation of beta-endorphin in the brain...|$|R

Trade levels enter the estimation in logs, whereas “trade first differences” are calculated as the rate of year-to-year changes in percentage. We also add lagged trade variables (lagged by 1  year) to allow for a more deferred adjustment process. Note that, overall, the coefficients of worker and job characteristics do not change in a qualitative manner in these different specifications, nor do the GAV and ICT coefficients (except for the low skill level as a consequence of its interaction with the trade variables). We find some evidence (on the 5 % significance level) for a significant effect of import levels on the probability of becoming unemployed for low-skilled employees: A 1 % higher import value is associated with a 0.017 % (0.016 % for lagged imports) higher probability of becoming unemployed. In other words, low-skilled individuals who work in industries characterized by relatively large contemporaneous imports may, ceteris paribus, face a slightly greater likelihood of becoming unemployed. As shown in the fourth and fifth columns of Table  2, no significant effects are found for first differences (i.e. changes) in import and export values: A change in imports or exports in a certain industry does not significantly affect the probability of becoming unemployed.|$|R

Although relatively safer the less efficiency of nonviral vectors compared with viral vectors is still the challenge for their application. Ectopic bone formation could be obtained using adenoviruses and adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding for several BMP genes by direct intramuscular injection [51 - 53]. For nonviral vector, gene-activated matrices (GAM) and <b>ex</b> vivo <b>procedure</b> are usually used to improve the in vivo effect. PEI-mediated BMP 4 gene delivery incorporated in a poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffold could enhance the bone regeneration in a cranial critical-sized defect [54].

Although it took slightly longer time than the adenoviral-mediated group, the mature bone matrix could be observed in the central region of the defect 6  weeks after the operation [36]. The ex vivo gene therapy for the orthopedic-oriented approaches provides the benefits of cellular component for fast and predictable bone formation. The novel technique of sonoporation and electroporation could further enhance the efficiency of nonviral vector-mediated gene delivery.
