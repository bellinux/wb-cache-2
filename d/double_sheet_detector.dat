40|$|Control of {{groundwater}} moving using sheet pile {{is very important}} for minimizing the potential {{of groundwater}} contamination. Present study aims to control the contaminant transport through soil by using equal <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles. Physical sand box model was implemented symmetrically in order to examine the effect of depths of <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles, distance between them and distance of contaminant upstream the sheet piles. The regional contaminated porous field is studied numerically using simulation software MODEFLOW and M 3 DMS. Average absolute difference time between experimental and numerical results that contamination moved from upstream to point under the second sheet pile and arrives the surface of soil at downstream, equals 9. 31 % and 6. 11 % respectively. Design charts are presented for quantifying the effects of equal <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles on the hydraulic control of the groundwater flow field. From the charts, the <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles depth can be selected according to the needed condition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{allusion to}} <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles(DSP) global optimal solution, the {{response}} surface(RS) technique based on Uniform Design- Support Vector Machine(UD-SVM) {{was introduced to}} build the RS by nonparametric regression, thus to avoid the complex non-linear RS form between the <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles parameters and indexes under the current standard. Use the Monte Carlo simulation as generator to produce samples, the RS can do considerable and non-repetitive efficiency prediction and get global optimal value satisfying to the target value with high accuracy and stability, also without figuring out the explicit formulations. This article applied the method to a <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles optimal design, and took minimum engineering quantity as criterion to screen for the optimal parameters aiming at illustrating the feasibility...|$|R
40|$|Knot {{strength}} {{is very important}} in processing ropes than other textile products. Thus <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> bends are usually used in rope mills, because their knots are small and strong in order to tie two threads of yarn. These knots have been made by manual operation. These mills, therefore, are demanding {{to be able to make}} these knots automatically in order to improve process efficiency. In this study, we have developed a knotter which is able to form a <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> bend by using a set of molds. First, we designed a path to carve tracks on the surface of the mold by using the Dowker notation. But this path was too complicated to thread yarn through the path easily. Furthermore, it is desired that the knotter can be carried by a worker in rope mills. We, therefore, have moved and/or composed paths in order to obtain the simpler path for <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> bends. Finally, we have integrated these molds and instruments such as air cylinders and linear guide ways in order to make a <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> bend knot automatically. © 2008 The Textile Machinery Society of Japan...|$|R
40|$|A {{deformable}} volume segmentation {{method is}} proposed {{to detect the}} breast parenchyma in frontal scanned 3 D whole breast ultrasound. Deformable volumes are {{a viable alternative to}} the deformable surface paradigm in noisy images with poorly defined object boundaries. A deformable ultrasound volume model was developed containing breast, rib, intercostal space and thoracic shadowing. Using prior knowledge about grey value statistics and shape the parameterized model deforms by optimization to match an ultrasound scan. Additionally a rib shadow enhancement filter was developed based on a Hessian <b>sheet</b> <b>detector.</b> An ROC chestwall detection study on 88 multi-center scans (20 non-visible chestwalls) showed a significant accuracy which improved strongly using the <b>sheet</b> <b>detector.</b> The results show the potential of our methodology to extract breast parenchyma which could help reduce false positives in subsequent computer aided lesion detection...|$|R

These objectives are reached by studying the assumed hypotheses when performing the acoustic measurements and by using a beamforming system; details about the vibratory pile driving are also given to obtain reproducible and representative measurements. The experiment results confirm some previouslypresented hypotheses and show two key parameters involved in the sound generation: {{the space between the}} welds of the common interlock of a <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> pile and the wall height above the soil of a neighbouring wall...|$|R

50|$|For the {{aircraft}} production number 292 (B-737) and after (this aircraft was production line number 152), an additional outer layer of skin or <b>doubler</b> <b>sheet</b> at the lap joint of the fuselage was added. In {{the construction of}} this aircraft this <b>doubler</b> <b>sheet</b> was not used {{in addition to other}} details of the bonding of the parts. In the case of production line 292 and after, this <b>doubler</b> <b>sheet</b> gave an additional thickness of 0.91 mm at the lap joint. In airplane line number 291 and before, cold bonding had been utilized, with fasteners used to maintain surface contact in the joint, allowing bonding adhesive to transfer load within the joint. This cold bonded joint used an epoxy-impregnated woven scrim cloth to join the edges of 0.9 mm thick skin panels. These epoxy cloths were reactive at room temperature, so they were stored at dry ice temperatures until used in manufacture. The bond cured at room temperature after assembly. The cold bonding process reduced the overall weight and manufacturing cost. Fuselage hoop loads (circumferential loads within the skins due to pressurization of the cabin) were intended to be transferred through the bonded joint, rather than through the rivets, allowing the use of lighter, thinner fuselage skin panels with no degradation in fatigue life.|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{variations}} of large-scale Birkeland currents are examined {{in a study}} of the source mechanisms and the closure of the three-dimensional current systems in the ionosphere. Vector magnetic field data acquired by the TRIAD satellite in the Northern Hemisphere were analyzed for the statistics of single <b>sheet</b> and <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> Birkeland currents during 555 passes during the summer and 408 passes during the winter. The single sheet currents are observed more frequently in the dayside of the auroral zone, and more often in summer than in winter. The intensities of both the single and double dayside currents are found to be greater in the summer than in the winter by a factor of two, while the intensities of the <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> Birkeland currents on the nightside do not show a significant difference from summer to winter. Both the single and <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> currents are found at higher latitudes in the summer than in the winter on the dayside. Results suggest that the Birkeland current intensities are controlled by the ionospheric conductivity in the polar region, and that the currents close via the polar cap when the conductivity there is sufficiently high. It is also concluded that an important source of these currents must be a voltage generator in the magnetosphere...|$|R
