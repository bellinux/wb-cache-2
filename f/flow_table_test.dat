40|$|In {{framework}} of this thesis we carried out tests on fresh cement mortars. The main {{purpose was to}} find out how the water-to-cement ratio and superplasticizer content determine rheological characteristics of fresh cement mortar. With the use of the CEM method we designed four reference mortar mixtures, based on the composition of concretes that had already been determined and analyzed in some other thesis. Additional mixtures were then made by modifying the reference mortars, composition in such way that the content of water or superplasticizer was varied. All mixtures were made of aggregate, cement, water and admixtures. As admixtures we used superplasticizer and air entraining agent. We also used two different types of cement. The tests were carried out using standard method of <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> <b>tests</b> for fresh mortars and non-standard measurement of rheological properties by using rheometer ConTec Viscometer 5. The main emphasis of the research work was on rheological measurements and the appertaining analyses of the obtained rheological parameters.

In the present scenario, where {{the supply of}} sand is falling short of meeting the demand, it becomes imperative to finding an alternative. Mud mortar was commonly used for low rise masonry buildings in the past. When the soil used for the mortar contains clay, problems like volume instability due to its high affinity towards water. To negate this effect, stabilization of the mortar is necessary. Cement and lime are used as binders individually and in combination. The paper focuses on an experimental study to understand the various characteristics of stabilized mud mortars. Workability and strength of 12 different combinations of stabilized mud mortars have been examined. <b>Flow</b> <b>table</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted to quantify the workability of the mortars.

40|$|In this thesis, {{effects of}} clay addition, clay replacement, and cement types on {{thixotropic}} behavior of cement-based materials are investigated. Thixotropy is {{the property of}} certain fluid materials that are thick or viscous under normal conditions but flow or become less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed. Freshly-mixed cement pastes are thixotropic materials, which become fluid when agitated but restore its structural form at rest. This is because cement pastes experience microstructure change with time due to the particles flocculation and cement hydration. The thixotropic behavior of cement-based materials {{is important in the}} modern concrete construction. Shape stability of concrete mixtures is often required for shotcrete and slip form construction so that the concrete mixture can adhere to the substrates or hold the shape right after casting and without support from formwork. Quick structural restore, or high thixotropy, of concrete can reduce formwork pressure in construction. Clay additions or replacement for cement often enhance concrete thixotropy and increase concrete shape stability. In the present study, the typical hysteresis loop rheology test method is employed to evaluate thixotropy of various cement pastes. The pastes were made with different types of cement and with /without clay addition/replacement. The types of cement used are Ashgrove Type I, Lafarge Type I/II, Type IV, and High Alkali Type I cement. The clay materials studied are Actigel, High Reactivity Metakaolin, and Ground Clay Brick. The rheology tests were performed at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 minutes right after each paste was mixed. The rates of thixotropy change with time were analyzed for each mixture. The standard <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> <b>tests</b> (ASTM C 230) were also conducted and the results were correlated with the rheological results. The rate of heat evolution of each paste studied is measured. The results indicate that clay addition and/or replacement for cement accelerates the rate of thixotropy change. The pastes made with different types of cement have different thixotropy changing rate. High Alkali cement has the highest thixotropy changing rate while both of Type IV and Ashgrove Type I cement have a lower thixotropy changing rate. There is a clear relationship between thixotropy and flow test results. The faster the increasing rate of thixotropy, the faster the decreasing rate of flow can be expected. The rate of heat generation can be correlated with thixotropy increasing rate...|$|R

Coconut shell has become the main contributor to the negative effect of environment problem due to poor waste disposal management which annual production of coconut shell waste reaches 3. 18 million tonnes. The purpose {{of this research is}} to study the partial replacement of fine aggregate with coconut shell powder (CSP) in mortar through experimental works. The main objective is to identify the properties of coconut shell powder mortars. The experiment start with using 0 %, 5 %, 10 % and 20 % of CSP replace fine aggregate in mortar mixing. The proportion of sand to cement to water used in mortar mix design is 2. 75 : 1 : 0. 6 according to the standard ASTM C 1329 - 05. The fresh and hardened properties tests was carried out for this mortar mix which are <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> <b>test,</b> Vicat test, compressive strength test and total porosity test by using 50 mm x 50 mm x 50 mm cube. The mortar cubes was cured and tested at the age of 7 days, 28 days and 60 days. X-ray Diffraction (XRD), X-ray Florescence (XRF) and Field Emission Scanning Electronic Microscope (FESEM) were also conducted to determine the chemical composition of coconut shell powder and the microstructure of CSP mortar. The result of the <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> <b>test</b> shows the mortar is more workable when the water content is reduced by increasing percentage of CSP in mortar. Moreover, the setting time result of the CSP mortar shows the mortar paste containing of CSP had accelerated the setting time.

40|$|Self-compacting {{concrete}} (SCC) {{is characterized}} by high flowability and segregation resistance. With the aid of these properties, SCC can be compacted into all corners of a formwork without using an external source of vibration. Sri Lanka {{has been in the}} back front of developing such a constructive material {{for the use of the}} local construction industry. This research had focused on the development of SCC using blended cement, which is enriched with limestone powder. Keeping in mind of the properties and the availability of the materials and also the economic factors, limestone powder along with the Ordinary Portland Cement were chosen as the major powder constituents to impart the necessary properties in the concrete to make it self compactable. The design process in this research devised a novel technique; that. is, the process of developing the SCC essentially involved three concomitant stages. In the first stage, paste mixes with relatively high flow ability and apparently high cohesiveness were found out using modified <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> <b>test</b> and apparent bleeding of the pastes. The modified <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> <b>test</b> was carried out with some modifications to suit the appropriateness of the tests to the objective of the research. In the second stage, the selected pastes from the first stage were used to produce self-compacting mortar mixes. V-funnel test and mortar blocking tests were carried out in this stage to investigate the flowing ability and viscosity of the mixes. As a result of these tests, optimum concentration of sand and high self-compactable mortar mixes were found out. The concentration 'of coarse aggregate, which could be used in the initial mix proportioning of the concrete, was found out through a supplementary research. Then the derived mortar mixes were used in the third stage to check the self-cornpactability of the concrete. U-box test and slump flow tests were performed at this stage to verify the self-compactability characteristics of the concrete. Relatively lower rank SCC was produced in this research. This research concluded that blended cement with limestone powder, such as masonry cement, could be effectively used in producing SCC. Also SCC was produced for limestone powder/OPC ratio equals 0. 56. It is highly effective to develop SCC by designing it through three connected stages; that is, by designing the paste, mortar and finally the concrete. Further to this development, a novel technique was discovered to quantitatively ascertain the resistance to segregation of the concrete by using modified L-box test.

Samples were loaded to failure and the average compressive strength was used for comparison purposes. <b>Flow</b> <b>table</b> <b>test</b> has been performed on the fresh concrete directly after mixing to measure workability and the average of the maximum concrete spread parallel to the two edges of the table was recorded. Results revealed that the optimum Fineness Modulus for the limestone to be used as fine aggregate in the concrete mix to get maximum compressive strength is 2. 78. The flow table tests revealed an increment in the workability of fresh concrete with higher Fineness Modulus of limestone used in the concrete mix as fine aggregate. The workability of the optimum Fineness Modulus, 2. 78, was found to be 412 mm which is a mix with considerable workability. An ideal grading has been recommended in this research study and checked to match the ASTM grading requirements for fine aggregate...|$|E

50|$|OpenFlow uses TCAM {{tables to}} route packet {{sequences}} (flows). If flows {{arrive at a}} switch, a <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> lookup is performed. Depending on the <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> implementation this is done in a software <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> if a vSwitch is used or in an ASIC if it's implemented in hardware. In the case when no matching flow is found a request to the controller for further instructions is sent. This is handled {{in one of three}} different modes. In reactive mode the controller acts after these requests and creates and installs a rule in the <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> for the corresponding packet if necessary. In proactive mode the controller populates <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> entries for all possible traffic matches possible for this switch in advance. This mode can be compared with typical routing table entries today, where all static entries are installed ahead of time. Following this no request is sent to the controller since all incoming flows will find a matching entry. A major advantage in proactive mode is that all packets are forwarded in line rate (considering all <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> entries in TCAM) and no delay is added. The third mode, hybrid mode, follows the flexibility of a reactive mode for a set of traffic and the low-latency forwarding (proactive mode) {{for the rest of the}} traffic.|$|R

This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. OpenFlow has become the key standard and technology for software defined networking, which has been widely adopted in various environments. However, the global deployment of OpenFlow encountered several issues, such as the increasing number of fields and complex structure of flow entries, making the size of <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> in OpenFlow switches explosively grows, which results in hardware implementation difficulty. To this end, this paper presents the modelling on the minimisation for storage space of <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> and proposes a Heuristic Storage space Optimisation algorithm for <b>Flow</b> <b>Table</b> (H-SOFT) to solve this optimisation problem. The H-SOFT algorithm degrades the complex and high-dimensional fields of a <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> into multiple <b>flow</b> <b>tables</b> with simple and low-dimensional fields based on the coexistence and conflict relationships among fields to release the unused storage space due to blank fields. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the H-SOFT algorithm can effectively reduce the storage space of <b>flow</b> <b>table.</b> In particular, with frequent updates on flow entries, the storage space compression rate of <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> is stable and can achieve at ~ 70 %. Moreover, in comparison with the optimal solution, the H-SOFT algorithm can achieve the similar compression rate with much lower execution time.
