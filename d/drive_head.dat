25|$|Before a disk can be accessed, {{the drive}} needs to {{synchronize}} its head {{position with the}} disk tracks. In some drives, this is accomplished with a Track Zero Sensor, while for others it involves the <b>drive</b> <b>head</b> striking an immobile reference surface. In either case, the head is moved {{so that it is}} approaching track zero position of the disk. When a drive with the sensor has reached track zero, the head stops moving immediately and is correctly aligned. For a drive without the sensor, the mechanism attempts to move the head the maximum possible number of positions needed to reach track zero, knowing that once this motion is complete, the head will be positioned over track zero.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the chief}} {{usability}} problems of the floppy disk is its vulnerability; even inside a closed plastic housing, the disk medium is highly sensitive to dust, condensation and temperature extremes. As with all magnetic storage, it is vulnerable to magnetic fields. Blank disks have been distributed with an extensive set of warnings, cautioning the user not to expose it to dangerous conditions. Disks must not be roughly treated or removed from the drive while the magnetic media is still spinning, since doing so is likely to cause damage to the disk, <b>drive</b> <b>head,</b> or stored data. On the other hand, the 3½‑inch floppy has been lauded for its mechanical usability by HCI expert Donald Norman: ...|$|E

2500|$|On such SD cards, {{standard}} utility {{programs such}} as Mac OS X's [...] "" [...] or Windows' SCANDISK {{can be used to}} repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files. Defragmentation tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards. The resulting consolidation of files may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file, but not an improvement comparable to defragmentation of hard drives, where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical, and relatively slow, movement of a <b>drive</b> <b>head.</b> Moreover, defragmentation performs writes to the SD card that count against the card's rated lifespan. The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on flash memory; newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance.|$|E
2500|$|Mixtures of decimal prefixes and binary sector sizes require care to {{properly}} calculate total capacity. Whereas semiconductor memory naturally favors powers of two (size doubles each time an address pin {{is added to}} the integrated circuit), the capacity of a disk drive is the product of sector size, sectors per track, tracks per side and sides (which in hard disk drives with multiple platters can be greater than 2). Although other sector sizes have been known in the past, formatted sector sizes are now almost always set to powers of two (256 bytes, 512 bytes, etc.), and, in some cases, disk capacity is calculated as multiples of the sector size rather than only in bytes, leading to a combination of decimal multiples of sectors and binary sector sizes. For example, 1.44MB 3½-inch HD disks have the [...] "M" [...] prefix peculiar to their context, coming from their capacity of 2,880 512-byte sectors (1,440 KiB), consistent with neither a decimal megabyte nor a binary mebibyte (MiB). Hence, these disks hold 1.47MB or 1.41MiB. Usable data capacity {{is a function of the}} disk format used, which in turn is determined by the FDD controller and its settings. Differences between such formats can result in capacities ranging from approximately 1300 to 1760 KiB (1.80 MB) on a standard 3½-inch high-density floppy (and up to nearly 2 MB with utilities such as 2M/2MGUI). The highest capacity techniques require much tighter matching of <b>drive</b> <b>head</b> geometry between drives, something not always possible and unreliable. For example, the LS-240 drive supports a 32MB capacity on standard 3½-inch HD disks, but it is, however, a write-once technique, and requires its own drive.|$|E

50|$|On the Commodore 64, several {{methods were}} used to protect {{software}}. For software distributed on ROM cartridges, subroutines were included which attempted to write over the program code.

Because of the operation of Commodore floppy drives, one write protection scheme would cause the floppy <b>drive</b> <b>head</b> to bang against {{the end of its}} rail, which could cause the <b>drive</b> <b>head</b> to become misaligned.
