2500|$|The Showa Emperor {{wanted to}} see if Puyi was {{reliable}} before giving him an imperial title, and it was not until October 1933 that General Doihara told him he was to be an emperor again, causing Puyi to go in his own words [...] "wild with joy", through Puyi was disappointed that he was not given back his old title of [...] "Great Qing Emperor". At the same time, Doihara informed Puyi that [...] "the Emperor [...] <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> and is represented in Manchukuo as the Kwantung army which must be obeyed like a father". Right from the start, Manchukuo, was infamous for its high crime rate, as Japanese-sponsored gangs of Chinese, Korean and Russian gangsters fought one another for the control of Manchukuo's opium houses, brothels, and gambling dens, with the Russian gangs having a particular interest in going after Jewish businessmen in Manchukuo for extortion and kidnapping. There were nine different Japanese or Japanese-sponsored police/intelligence agencies operating in Manchukuo, who were all told by Tokyo that Japan was a poor country and that they were to pay for their operations by engaging in organized crime. The Italian adventurer Amleto Vespa remembered that General Kenji Doihara told him Manchuria was going have to pay for its own exploitation. In 1933, Simon Kaspé, a French Jewish pianist visiting his father in Manchukuo, who owned a hotel in Harbin, was kidnapped, tortured and murdered by an anti-Semitic gang from the Russian Fascist Party. The Kaspé case become an international cause célèbre, attracting much media attention around the world, ultimately leading to two trials in Harbin in 1935 and 1936, as the evidence that the Russian Fascist gang who had killed Kaspé was working for the Kempeitai become too strong for even Tokyo to ignore. In Asia, the rule of law is seen as one of the marks of [...] "civilization", which is why the Japanese and Manchukuo media spent so much time disparaging the chaotic and corrupt legal system run by the [...] "Young Marshal" [...] Zhang with Puyi portrayed as having (with a little help from the Kwantung Army) saved the people from the chaos of the rule by the Zhangs. Manchukuo's high crime rate, especially the much publicized Kaspé case, made a mockery of the claim that Puyi had saved the people of Manchuria from a lawless and violent regime.|$|E
