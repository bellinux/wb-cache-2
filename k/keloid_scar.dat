40|$|BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis, a {{response}} to injury, may {{be thought of as}} scarring in the artery wall. TGF-beta and associated signaling molecules have been implicated in the pathophysiology of <b>keloid</b> <b>scarring,</b> Dupuytren 2 ̆ 7 s Contracture and atherosclerotic plaques in independent studies. PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that excess cutaneous scarring and Dupuytren 2 ̆ 7 s contractures predispose independently to carotid atherosclerosis. METHODS: Among 1, 747 patients with plaque measurements and complete data for multivariable regression analysis, 57 Caucasian patients had Dupuytren 2 ̆ 7 s contractures and 12 had <b>keloid</b> <b>scars.</b> Carotid total plaque area (TPA) was measured by 2 -Dimensional ultrasound. RESULTS: In linear multivariable regression analysis with coronary risk factors, <b>keloid</b> <b>scars</b> were associated with TPA (P= 0. 018), but Dupuytren 2 ̆ 7 s contractures were not. Patients with <b>keloid</b> <b>scarring</b> were younger (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001), and more likely to be diabetic (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) CONCLUSIONS: <b>Keloid</b> <b>scarring</b> is a clinical clue to excess atherosclerosis not explained by traditional risk factors. Such patients may benefit from therapy directed at targets related to signalling molecules common to both the process of <b>keloid</b> <b>scarring</b> and atherosclerosis. These findings suggest previously unexplored possibilities for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.

50|$|Keloid, {{also known}} as keloid {{disorder}} and keloidal scar,is {{the formation of a}} type of scar which, depending on its maturity, is composed mainly of either type III (early) or type I (late) collagen. It is a result of an overgrowth of granulation tissue (collagen type 3) at the site of a healed skin injury which is then slowly replaced by collagen type 1. Keloids are firm, rubbery lesions or shiny, fibrous nodules, and can vary from pink to the color of the person's skin or red to dark brown in color. A <b>keloid</b> <b>scar</b> is benign and not contagious, but sometimes accompanied by severe itchiness, pain, and changes in texture. In severe cases, it can affect movement of skin. Keloid scars are seen 15 times more frequently in people of African descent than in people of European descent.|$|E

40|$|Keloids are thick, raised scars that {{represent}} an extreme form of abnormal scarring. Unlike normal <b>scars,</b> <b>keloids</b> {{extend beyond the}} original wound margin and rarely regress; instead, they tend to proliferate indefinitely. 1 - 4 These bulky scars can significantly impair function due to itching, pain, and decreased range of motion 5 and can negatively impact psychosocial well-being and overall quality of life. 5 - 7 Although many different therapeutic modalities exist, keloids are extremely resistant to treatment and have {{a high rate of}} recurrence. 1, 2, 8 - 10 Development of effective, targeted interventions has been limited due to an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of <b>keloid</b> <b>scarring.</b> Furthermore, because <b>keloid</b> <b>scarring</b> is only found in humans, there are no animal models of <b>keloid</b> <b>scarring,</b> which has hindered the evaluation of novel therapies.

5|$|Hypertrophic scars are uncommon, and are {{characterized}} by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin.

40|$|Stimulation of α 1 -adrenoceptors evokes {{inflammatory}} cytokine production, boosts neurogenic inflammation and pain, and influences cellular migration and proliferation. Hence, these receptors {{may play a}} role both in normal and abnormal wound healing. To investigate this, the distribution of α 1 -adrenoceptors in skin biopsies of burn <b>scars</b> (N= 17), <b>keloid</b> <b>scars</b> (N= 12) and unscarred skin (N= 17) was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Staining intensity was greater on vascular smooth muscle in burn scars than in unscarred tissue, consistent with heightened expression of α 1 -adrenoceptors. In addition, expression of α 1 -adrenoceptors was greater on dermal nerve fibres, blood vessels and fibroblasts in <b>keloid</b> <b>scars</b> than in either burn scars or unscarred skin. These findings suggest that increased vascular expression of α 1 -adrenoceptors could alter circulatory dynamics both in burn and <b>keloid</b> <b>scars.</b> In addition, the augmented expression of α 1 -adrenoceptors in keloid tissue may contribute to processes that produce or maintain <b>keloid</b> <b>scars,</b> and might be a source of the uncomfortable sensations often associated with these scars...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Keloid scars {{following}} median sternotomy {{are rare}} and occur {{more frequently in}} pigmented skin. Different management strategies have been described with variable success. We present a case of <b>keloid</b> <b>scar</b> formation following cardiac surgery including our management and the final aesthetic result. Case description A 64 year old female of fair complexion underwent mitral valve replacement. The procedure and postoperative recovery were uncomplicated, however, during the following year, thick keloid scars formed over the incision sites. Initial non surgical measures failed to relieve pain and did not offer any tangible aesthetic benefit. Eventually surgical excision was attempted. She presented to our clinic for nine months follow up with significant improvement in pain and aesthetic result. Discussion and Evaluation Several theories have attempted to explore the pathophysiology of <b>keloid</b> <b>scar</b> formation. A number of predisposing factors have been documented however none existed in this case. A variety of invasive and non invasive approaches have been described but significant differences in success rates and methodology of investigations still precludes a standardized management protocol. Conclusions In this case study a rare presentation of <b>keloid</b> <b>scar</b> has been presented. The variety of methods used to improve pain and aesthetic result demonstrates the propensity of keloid scars to recur and the therapeutic challenges that surgeons have to face {{in their quest for}} a satisfactory patient outcome. </p...|$|E

The majority of BCCs are reported to occur on the auricular helix and periauricular region due to ultraviolet light exposure. Despite the frequency of BCCs, those that develop within scar tissue are rare, and the phenomenon of keloid BCCs has rarely been reported in the literature. Keloid collagen within BCCs is associated with morphoeiform characteristics, ulceration, or necrosis. Extensive keloid collagen is often seen in BCCs of the ear region, a site prone to keloid scarring. This article presents a rare case of a secondary tumor (BCC) which arose on top of a primary tumor (<b>keloid</b> <b>scar)</b> on the right auricle region in a healthy 23 -year-old female after an ear piercing 2 years prior.

40|$|Background: Intralesional {{cryotherapy}} {{is a novel}} {{treatment for}} <b>keloid</b> <b>scars</b> in which the scar is frozen from inside. Published results are promising, but the treatment has only been tested in a Caucasian patient population. Therefore, the authors evaluated intralesional cryotherapy in a patient population including different Fitzpatrick skin types (I through VI). Methods: This prospective multicenter study with a 1 -year follow-up included 27 patients with 29 <b>keloid</b> <b>scars.</b> Intralesional cryotherapy was administered with a disposable liquid nitrogen-based device called CryoShape. Scar assessment was performed using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale and four objective devices to determine scar color, scar elasticity, scar volume, and patient skin type. Results: <b>Keloid</b> <b>scars</b> showed an average volume decrease of 63 percent (range, 16 to 100 percent) after 12 months, compared with baseline (p < 0. 01). Recurrence was seen in seven keloids (24 percent) and hypopigmentation recovered in 69 percent of all <b>keloid</b> <b>scars</b> within 12 months. Scar assessment with the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale showed an overall improvement according to both doctors and patients. In addition, complaints of pain and itching were reduced. When analyzing the results per Fitzpatrick skin type, African American patients showed {{a higher incidence of}} persistent hypopigmentation (p = 0. 02). Conclusions: Intralesional cryotherapy for the treatment of <b>keloid</b> <b>scars</b> shows favorable results in terms of reduction of volume and complaints of pain and pruritus. However, no complete eradication was obtained in some cases and recurring scars were seen. In addition, persistent hypopigmentation proved a problem in non-Caucasian patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: Intralesional (IL) {{cryotherapy}} {{is a new}} promising {{technique for}} the treatment of <b>keloid</b> <b>scars,</b> in which the scar is frozen from inside. Multiple devices are available, mostly based on a simple liquid nitrogen Dewar system, which have a limited freezing capacity. Argon gas-based systems ensure accurate and highly controlled freezing and have shown to be effective within the field of oncologic surgery. However, this technique has never been used {{for the treatment of}} <b>keloid</b> <b>scars.</b> Objective: This prospective study evaluates an argon gas-based system for the treatment of keloids in a patient population including all Fitzpatrick skin types with a 1 -year follow-up. Methods: Twenty-five patients with 30 <b>keloid</b> <b>scars</b> were included and treated with a device called Seednet (Galil Medical, Yokneam, Israel). Scar quality and possible scar recurrence were assessed before treatment and post treatment (6 and 12 months) with objective devices determining scar color, scar elasticity, scar volume, and patient's skin type. In addition, scars were evaluated using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. Results: After 12 months, a significant volume reduction of 62 % was obtained, p Z 0. 05. Moreover, complaints of pain and itching were alleviated and scar quality had improved according to the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. Scar pigmentation recovered in 62 % of all <b>keloid</b> <b>scars</b> within 12 months. Five out of 30 (17 %) scars recurred within 12 months, three of which had previously been treated with liquid nitrogen-based IL cryotherapy. Both recurrent and persistent hypopigmentation were mainly seen in Afro-American patients. Conclusions: IL cryotherapy with the use of an argon gas-based system proves to be effective in the treatment of <b>keloid</b> <b>scars,</b> yielding volume reduction and low recurrence rates. Although hypopigmentation recovered in most cases, it is strongly related to non-Caucasian patients.
