5|$|Slavery in Haiti {{started with}} the arrival of Christopher Columbus on the island in 1492. The {{practice}} was devastating to the native population.

During the French colonial period beginning in 1625, the economy of Haiti (then known as Saint-Domingue) was based on slavery, and the practice there was regarded as the most brutal in the world. The Haitian Revolution of 1804, the only successful slave revolt in human history, precipitated the end of slavery not only in Saint-Domingue, but in all French colonies. However, several Haitian leaders following the revolution employed forced labor, believing a plantation-style economy was the only way for Haiti to succeed, and building fortifications to safeguard against attack by the French. During the U.S. occupation between 1915 and 1934, the U.S. military forced Haitians to work building roads for defense against Haitian resistance fighters.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{analytical}} frame of discrimination, the thesis establishes a model of transfer of rural <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> into city, and researches the impact of rural <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> transfer on urban-rural income.

In order to elevate the rural income level in China and narrow urban-rural income gap, the government should paint a picture with two brushes at the same time: on one hand, the government should promote the transfer of rural <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> into city, and change the status quo of dual urban-rural <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> market structure; on the other hand, the government should increase the input in rural areas and promote the increase of rural capital stock so as to further increase rural residents' income in the process of <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> transfer. <b>Labour</b> <b>forces</b> transfer, Urban-rural income, Income gap, The Economics of Discrimination, China, Agribusiness,...|$|R
