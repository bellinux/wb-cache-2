5|$|The {{family lived}} in Norman until Warren was 11, when they moved to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, a {{salesman}} at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack—which led to many medical bills, {{as well as a}} pay cut because he could not do his previous work. Eventually, this led to the loss of their car from failure to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalog</b> order department at Sears. When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The Musée suisse de l'appareil photographique at Vevey holds around 1,000 {{photographs}} taken for test purposes {{during the development}} of Michel's camera. Most of the photos were taken with 16mm orthopanchromatic Agfa film with a speed of ISO 8/10°. The exposed format was 10mm × 34mm. The quality was sufficient for a tenfold magnification. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalog</b> of the 2007 exhibition Des pigeons photographes? they are classified as test photos {{on the ground or}} from a window, human perspectives from the ground or from elevated points, aeroplane-based aerial photographs, aerial photographs of relatively high altitude that were probably taken by pigeons released from a plane, and {{only a small number of}} typical pigeon photographs.|$|E

25|$|In 1820 a {{handwritten}} catalog of 3,168 titles was published {{and is now}} in the library's Rare Book Room. The catalog was organized into two main sections: one an alphabetical section, usually by author, and the other a section of state laws. The first entry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalog</b> is The Annual Register (a British publication still being issued) and the last is Xenophon's Cyropedia.|$|E

25|$|At the Indépendants of 1908, a {{painting}} by Braque strikes Apollinaire by its originality. Though not listed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalog,</b> it was described in L'Intransigeant. In his review published in La Revue des lettres et des arts (1 May 1908), Apollinaire claims that Braque's work is the most original presented at the salon.

50|$|Except for updated {{versions}} of the 1937 whistling billboard and trackage, all of <b>the</b> products offered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1941 <b>catalog</b> had been designed under Gilbert's ownership. The 'Chicago' products had been expunged. The scale accuracy was emphasized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalogs</b> and packaging. Already experiencing materials shortages (due to Lend Lease), no new products were introduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1942 <b>catalog,</b> which was only slight different than the previous edition. Prices were printed on an accompanying unstapled sheet {{but not on the}} bound pages. Even the set numbers (i.e. 4117) were not changed. The cover of the '42 edition is distinguished from the '41 by a caveat about erratic availability printed in small red fonts.|$|R

Lebanese singer Lydia Canaan is listed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalog</b> of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives in Cleveland, Ohio, USA as the first rock star of the Middle East.

25|$|The catalog {{published}} in 1801 indicated {{a collection of}} 452 books, mostly on history and travel. By 1815, there were 1,022 entries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalog,</b> and the collection had added more biographies, fiction, and magazines. The library was housed in several locations over the ensuing years, including the New Market House next to the City Hall, the Lyceum Company building, and Peabody Hall, which was owned by the Alexandria School Board. Raising funds for the library was a continuing challenge. In 1853, a lecture series was created to raise money. Speakers included Professor Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian, Colonel Francis H. Smith of the Virginia Military Institute, and humorist George W. Bagby.|$|E
25|$|In 1847, Sears C. Walker of the U.S. Naval Observatory searched {{historical}} records and surveys for possible prediscovery sightings {{of the planet}} Neptune. He found that observations made by Lalande's staff at the Paris Observatory in 1795 were {{in the direction of}} Neptune's position in the sky. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalog</b> observations for May 8 and again on May 10 of 1795 a star was observed in the approximate position expected for Neptune. The uncertainty of the position was noted with a colon. This notation was also used to indicate an observation error so {{it was not until the}} original records of the observatory were reviewed that it was established with certainty that the object was Neptune and the position error in the observations made two nights apart was due to the planet's motion across the sky. The discovery of these records of Neptune's position in 1795 led to a better calculation of the planet's orbit.|$|E
25|$|Music is {{pervasive}} in Lebanese society. While traditional folk music remains popular in Lebanon, modern music reconciling Western and traditional Arabic styles, pop, and fusion are rapidly advancing in popularity. Radio stations feature {{a variety of}} music, including traditional Lebanese, classical Arabic, Armenian and modern French, English, American, and Latin tunes. Prominent traditional musicians include Fairuz, an icon during the civil war, Sabah Melhem Barakat, Wadih El Safi, Majida El Roumi, and Najwa Karam who built an international audience for the genre. Historical figure and Lebanese musical pioneer Lydia Canaan is listed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalog</b> of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives in Cleveland, Ohio, USA as the first rock star of the Middle East. Canaan's unique style fuses Middle-Eastern quarter notes and microtones with anglophone rock. Marcel Khalife, a musician who blends classical Arab music with modern sounds, boasts immense popularity for his politically charged lyrics. Distinguished pop artists include Nancy Ajram, Haifa Wehbe, Fadl Shaker, Elissa, and Mika.|$|E

500|$|After 1 October 1936, German {{procedure}} changed, and {{the number}} of plugboard connections became variable, ranging between five and eight. As a result, the grill method became considerably less effective. However, a method using a card catalog had been devised around 1934 or 1935, and was independent of the number of plug connections. The catalog was constructed using Rejewski's [...] "cyclometer", a special-purpose device for creating a catalog of permutations.
