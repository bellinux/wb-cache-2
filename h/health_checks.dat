Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E

40|$|Background Studies {{have found}} that <b>health</b> <b>checking</b> in primary care led to the {{identification}} of previously unrecognized morbidity among adults with intellectual disabilities. The aim here was to evaluate whether <b>health</b> <b>checking</b> stimulated increased consultation with the general practitioner or {{another member of the}} primary care team, increased health promotion actions undertaken outside the <b>health</b> <b>check</b> or increased contact with specialists. Method Data on the above three categories of activity were abstracted from the medical records of 77 adult participants with intellectual disabilities for eight 6 -month periods before and seven 6 month periods after they had undergone a <b>health</b> <b>check.</b> Comparisons of access to care before and after the <b>health</b> <b>check</b> were made using non-parametric statistics. Results On average, participants had 5. 4 and 1. 8 primary care and specialist consultations per year respectively. There {{were no significant differences in}} either rate before and after the <b>health</b> <b>check.</b> The frequency of health promotion actions increased significantly after the <b>health</b> <b>check</b> from a mean of 1. 2 to 2. 2 /year. Conclusions Comparison of the primary care and specialist consultations rates of people with intellectual disabilities with those for the general population might suggest that the former have greater access to these services. However, comparison to the general practitioner consultation rates of patients with other chronic conditions would seem to indicate that contact with primary care may not be commensurate with need. Attention to health promotion is inadequate. Further research is required to substantiate whether <b>health</b> <b>checking</b> increases <b>health</b> promotion and how increased health promotion activity would affect the health of this population...|$|R

40|$|Background. The NHS <b>Health</b> <b>Check</b> {{programme}} aims {{to improve}} prevention, early diagnosis {{and management of}} cardiovascular disease (CVD) in England. High and equitable uptake {{is essential for the}} programme to effectively reduce the CVD burden. Objectives. Assessing the impact of a local financial incentive scheme on uptake and statin pre-scribing in the first 2  years of the programme. Methods. Cross-sectional study using data from electronic medical records of general practices in Hammersmith and Fulham, London on all patients aged 40 – 74  years. We assessed uptake of complete <b>Health</b> <b>Check,</b> exclusion of patients from the programme (exception reporting) and statin prescriptions in patients confirmed with high CVD risk. Results. The <b>Health</b> <b>Check</b> uptake was 32. 7 % in Year 1 and 20. 0 % in Year 2.  Older patients had higher uptake of <b>Health</b> <b>Check</b> than younger (65 - to 74 -year-old patients: Year 1 adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2. 05 (1. 67 – 2. 52) & Year 2 AOR 2. 79 (2. 49 – 3. 12) compared with 40 - to 54 -year-old patients).

Roosevelt issued an order to suppress prostitution near military bases—affecting the red-light districts of Reno and Las Vegas. When this order was lifted in 1948, Reno officials tried to shut down a brothel as a public nuisance; this action was upheld by the Nevada Supreme Court in 1949. In 1951, both Reno and Las Vegas had closed their red-light districts as public nuisances, but brothels continued to exist throughout the state.|$|E
