25|$|In chemistry, Schrödinger, Pauling, Mulliken {{and others}} {{noted that the}} {{consequence}} of Heisenberg's relation was that the electron, as a wave packet, could not be considered to have an exact location in its orbital. Max Born suggested that the electron's position needed to be described by a probability distribution which was connected with finding the electron {{at some point in}} the wave-function which described its associated wave packet. The new quantum mechanics did not give exact results, but only the probabilities for the occurrence of a variety of possible such results. Heisenberg held that the path of a moving particle has no meaning if we cannot observe <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> cannot with electrons in an atom.|$|E

500|$|On August 1, 1895, {{the first}} part of The Woman's Bible was published, {{covering}} the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The text went through seven printings in six months; it was a best-seller. In January 1898, the second part was published, covering the rest of the Old Testament as well as all of the New Testament. It included a Preface written by Stanton in which she acknowledged that [...] "Both friend and foe object to the title." [...] Nevertheless, she praised the Revising Committee for showing [...] "a more worshipful reverence for the great Spirit of All Good than does the Church." [...] Stanton wrote: [...] "We have made a fetich [...] of the Bible long enough. The time has come to read <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> do all other books, accepting the good and rejecting the evil it teaches." ...|$|E
500|$|Under the {{supervision}} of the management team, the Monks conducted extensive rehearsals with a focus on gritty, rhythmically oriented music. The band equipped themselves with new instruments and hardware to achieve that goal: a Maestro fuzz box (and eventually a wah-wah pedal) for Burger, a floor tom for Johnston, and a six-string banjo for Day, the latter of which offered a disorienting counter-rhythm to the bass section. Shaw explained that the group's motivation was to possess [...] "high rhythm and high energy". He elaborated further, saying [...] "The idea of it was to get as much 'beat' out of <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could. As much 'bam-bam-bam-bam' on the beat or whatever. The only time cymbals would be used would be for accent. If anyone wasn't contributing towards rhythm, then it wasn't part of the Monks sound". However, the band's transformation into the Monks was painstakingly slow, taking the group nearly a year of trial-and-error before they were confident enough to return to the studio.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Suttirat Anne Larlarb {{says the}} real Jobs never wore his trademark turtleneck jumper {{at any of}} the launches: [...] "The turtleneck was the off book decision. In those 3 actual launches, in real life, he never wore that. In the 1998 portion of the film, in real life he was wearing a dark greyish/brownish suit. We made it for him as a back up idea in case we needed to adhere to <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>we</b> got closer to the time of filming, I thought we'd set up rules for 1984, we'd set up rules for 1988 – there's so much of the film that's about design and he was about design." [...] Fassbender also remarked that the historically inaccurate black turtleneck for the third act was intentional, believing that wearing the attire [...] "felt like I had arrived at [...] vision, that the person had arrived." [...] Fassbender later added that he and Danny Boyle decided on this look during filming, and wanted to [...] "give the audience kind of a payoff." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Borderline" [...] {{was filmed}} on {{location}} in Los Angeles, California from January 30 to February 2, 1984 {{and was the first}} video that Madonna made with director Mary Lambert, who later also directed the videos [...] "Like a Virgin", [...] "Material Girl", [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". Author Allen Metz noted how the video portrayed Madonna's then [...] "burgeoning star quality". It is regarded as one of her career-making moments when the video was started to be shown on MTV. She acted as the girlfriend of a Hispanic street guy who is picked up by a British photographer who publishes her picture on a magazine cover. The portrayal of the street life and high-fashion scene in the video was a reference to Madonna's life in the gritty, multiracial streets and clubs that she used to haunt while her career was beginning, as well as the world of popularity and success she was experiencing at that moment. The storyline involved her being emotionally torn between the photographer and her boyfriend. Madonna's boyfriend in the video is portrayed as Latino, and her struggles with this relationship depicted the struggle Hispanic women faced with their men. Lambert said that there was [...] "no formula" [...] used when making the [...] "Borderline" [...] video and that they were [...] "inventing <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> went along." [...] In the January 1997 issue of Rolling Stone, Lambert described the video and its plot as, [...] "Boy and girl enjoy simple pleasures of barrio love, girl is tempted by fame, boy gets huffy, girl gets famous, but her new beau's out-of-line reaction to a behavioral trifle (all she did was to spray-paint his expensive sports car) drives her back to her true love." ...|$|E

At the beginning, the production team played music with the band as they experimented with horns, percussion, drums, guitars and keys. DJ Swivel explained: [...] "We'd be taking loops, like a section of percussion — congas for example — and then using them on a completely different record; and that record might be a completely different tempo or in a different key, so we'd literally be pitching <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> went.

2500|$|On December 25, 2006, the United States {{arrested at}} least four senior {{military}} officials on their visit to Baghdad. It has been mentioned that the Iranians have been arrested after US soldiers raided the compound of Shiite leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, leader of the influential Shiite Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI). President of Iraq Talabani, a strong US ally, has asked for their release. Hiwa Othman, Talabani's media adviser, told Reuters: [...] "The president is unhappy. He is talking to the Americans about <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> speak." [...] Othman said the Iranian diplomats came to Iraq {{at the invitation of}} the Iraqi leader but he was not aware if they had met with him."The invitation was within the framework of an agreement between Iran and Iraq to improve the security situation." [...] Finally, it seems that they have been released on 30 December. One of the commanders, identified by officials simply as Chizari, was the third-highest-ranking official of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' al-Quds Brigade, the unit most active in aiding, arming and training groups outside Iran, including Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad, U.S. officials said.|$|E

2500|$|As with {{previous}} sessions, Mike Sapone acted {{as both a}} band member and co-producer, while the band were also involved in the albums production. Discussing Sapone's involvement, Lacey defined Sapone as having [...] "as much at stake with the music as we do; he's as invested in <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> are, sometimes more." [...] Accardi described Sapone as having [...] "an uncanny ability to hear something you’re doing and immediately track it to any song in his library that he stores in his brain. He'll go to it, {{show it to you}} and tell you that that’s what needs to happen. Here's the better version of it. This is what you’re trying to do and you don't even realize it." [...] Most of the songs were brought to the studio in acoustic form, sometimes as a complete song and sometimes as just a part or riff. The band would then build upon these ideas, recording everything as they worked. The band members were not limited by their normal roles within Brand New, with much instrument swapping and experimenting taking place in writing individual parts. Lacey later commented that [...] "it was such a collaborative effort with the band. Vin might write a drum part or Brian might write a guitar part or whatever. We're not really keeping tabs of how much everyone has at stake on each song".|$|E
2500|$|Because God is [...] "an {{absolutely}} perfect being" [...] (I), Leibniz {{argues that}} God would be acting imperfectly if he acted with any less perfection {{than what he}} is able of (III). His syllogism then ends {{with the statement that}} God has made the world perfectly in all ways. This also effects how we should view God and his will. Leibniz states that, in lieu of God’s will, {{we have to understand that}} God [...] "is the best of all masters" [...] and he will know when his good succeeds, so we, therefore, must act in conformity to his good will – or as much of <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> understand (IV). In our view of God, Leibniz declares that we cannot admire the work solely because of the maker, lest we mar the glory and love God in doing so. Instead, we must admire the maker for the work he has done (II). Effectively, Leibniz states that if we say the earth is good because of the will of God, and not good according to some standards of goodness, then how can we praise God for what he has done if contrary actions are also praiseworthy by this definition (II). Leibniz then asserts that different principles and geometry cannot simply be from the will of God, but must follow from his understanding.|$|E
2500|$|Three weeks later, on 30 April 1864, {{the measure}} of devotion to the Hauhau {{movement}} displayed itself in the reckless march by 200 warriors on the Sentry Hill redoubt, 9km north-east of New Plymouth, in a one-sided battle that cost the lives of possibly {{a fifth of the}} Māori force. The redoubt had been built in late 1863 by Captain W. B. Messenger and 120 men of the Military Settlers on the crown of a hill that was the site of an ancient pā, and garrisoned by a detachment of 75 men from the 57th Regiment under Captain Shortt, with two Coehorn mortars. The construction of the outpost was regarded by the Atiawa as a challenge, being built close to the Māori position at Manutahi and on their land. In April 1864 a war party was formed of the best fighting men from the west coast iwi that had joined the rapidly spreading Hauhau movement. In a 1920 interview with historian James Cowan, Te Kahu-Pukoro, a fighter {{who took part in the}} attack, explained: [...] "The Pai-marire religion was then new, and we were all completely under its influence and firmly believed in the teaching of Te Ua and his apostles.
