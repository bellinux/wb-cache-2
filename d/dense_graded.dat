50|$|Advantages: The primary {{advantage}} of <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> mixtures {{compared to other}} mixtures is lower initial cost.

50|$|Disadvantages: <b>Dense</b> <b>graded</b> {{mixtures}} cannot accommodate high asphalt contents {{without becoming}} unstable and susceptible to rutting. Relatively low amounts of asphalt are typically used in <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> mixtures, {{which in turn}} makes them more susceptible to cracking and more permeable.

40|$|The {{performance}} of pavements is intimately {{related to their}} structural design and to their components. However, pavement friction is highly important as {{it is one of}} the factors which determine pavement safety. The number of crashes derived from wet skidding is reduced when a vehicle tire and the pavement surface experience more friction. Skid resistance and texture are vital safety characteristics which need to be considered when pavement mixes are tested in laboratory. The objective of this study was to evaluate skidding based on macrotexture and microtexture used in the International Friction Index (IFI). This study was conducted in asphait mixtures slabs produced in laboratory. Two different mixtures <b>grading</b> (<b>dense</b> and gap) were produced using conventional asphalt and asphalt rubber. The characterization of the macrotexture and microtexture of asphalt pavements surfaces was obtained by the following tests: (i) British pendulum; (ii) Volumetric Method. IFI values were calculated through the pair of the parameters: Sp and F 60. The results showed that the gap-graded mixture had a more texture in comparison to mixtures with a <b>dense</b> <b>grade</b> gradation. Asphalt rubber mixtures improved the skid resistance compared to conventional mixtures...|$|R
50|$|Typical Use: <b>Dense</b> <b>graded</b> {{mixtures}} in Item 341 can be {{used for}} a wide variety of applications ranging from new construction to overlays. <b>Dense</b> <b>graded</b> mixtures may be appropriate for applications ranging from high volume (or high demand) roadways to low volume (or low demand) roadways depending on the specified binder grade, aggregate properties, etc. <b>Dense</b> <b>graded</b> mixtures {{can be used}} as base, intermediate or surface layers.|$|E
50|$|Disadvantages: <b>Dense</b> <b>graded</b> {{mixtures}} cannot accommodate high asphalt contents {{without becoming}} unstable and susceptible to rutting. Relatively low amounts of asphalt are typically used in <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> mixtures, {{which in turn}} makes them more susceptible to cracking and more permeable. Generally speaking, <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> mixtures can be designed to be either highly rut resistant or highly crack resistant but not both. <b>Dense</b> <b>graded</b> mixtures are not designed to have stone on stone contact.

Attempting to “coarsen” the mix to allow for more asphalt or to make the mix more rut resistant often has an adverse effect. Coarsening the mix often leads to a dryer mix and one that is more difficult to compact, more permeable and more susceptible to segregation. The texture of <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> surface mixtures (Type C, D, and F) is relatively low. This can affect wet weather traction depending on the aggregate type, size and mineralogy.|$|E

Beam specimens were tested at the temperatures of 20 °C and three different peak tensile strain (400, 600 and 800 μɛ) and used classical and energy-stiffness ratio approach to analyse fatigue life of the asphalt mixtures. According to the test results, the fatigue lifes of the BRA modified asphalt mixtures were higher than that for the unmodified asphalt mixtures at the test temperature and tensile strain. Moreover, based on the initial flexure stiffness and phase angle values, BRA modified asphalt mixtures showed more elastic and less viscous behaviour than unmodified mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Waste {{concrete}} aggregate (WCA) refers to aggregates {{that have been}} used previously in cement concrete structures. After many research it had been concluded that WCA can be used in bituminous concrete. In bituminous concrete mix, there is a wide scope for varying the gradation of aggregate to obtain a good mix without affecting the durability of pavement. Bituminous concrete mixes with WCA in accordance with different gradations were studied. Behavior of bituminous concrete mixes with WCA is also investigated with two different compactive energy, one for medium traffic and another for heavy traffic. The research program concentrated on the Marshall design criteria for bituminous mixes. A <b>dense</b> <b>grading</b> with 25 mm maximum size is found to give the most satisfactory result from the stand point of stability, stiffness, deformation and voids characteristics. Test results reveal that the bituminous concrete with WCA can give satisfactory results when they are constructed using dense gradation and medium compaction...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effect water ratio in relation to dry mass has on the mechanical properties of refractory materials. A number of different refractory materials ranging from lightweight to <b>dense</b> <b>grade</b> were investigated for the following properties: - permanent dimensional change; - bulk density; - cold compressive strength; and - cold modulus of rupture. Water is an essential component when preparing refractory materials however with increased water ratio adverse mechanical properties developed. Each of the materials tested suffered an increase in permanent dimensional change {{as a result of}} increased water ratio between the dried and the fired state. The degree of shrinkage associated with the increase in water ratio was more significant in the dense materials. Each material tested exhibited a reduction in fired bulk density associated with an increase in water ratio. This reduction was relatively consistent across all materials tested. An increase in water ratio was associated with a reduction in each material's ability to withstand a compressive force. The cold compressive test results tended to display a more significant reduction in compressive strength for the denser materials. All materials exhibited a greater than expected flexural strength when prepared in accordance with manufacturers' recommendations. As additional water was used the cold modulus of rupture results of all materials reduced indicating that increased water ratio decreases a refractory materials ability to withstand a bending force...|$|R
40|$|The {{high modulus}} asphalt {{mixtures}} (EME) are constituted by an asphalt binder of low penetration and aggregates {{that have a}} <b>dense</b> <b>grading</b> curve providing high resistance to permanent deformation and shear stresses. The recycled hot mixtures asphalt (RHMA) with the incorporation of high percentage of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) have potential for the use as an alternative material for the mentioned technique (EME). Its viability is given {{by the fact that}} the RAP oxidized binder has higher stiffness (low penetration), and also by the economy that can be achieve with the use of raw material from recycling with potential lower cost. This paper presents a study of the potential use of different RHMA with high percentages of RAP as a base and intermediate course of pavements, such as: (i) Mixture I, composed exclusively by RAP as aggregate; (ii) Mixture II, composed by 75 % of RAP and 25 % of natural aggregates; (iii) Mixture III, composed by 75 % of RAP and 25 % of asphalt plant refuse aggregates. Thus, besides the characterization of these materials in the laboratory, computational analyzes were performed based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). The values of displacements, deformations and stresses obtained for the different asphalt pavement structures composed by these mixtures were evaluated and, from that, the traffic that they were able to withstand was calculated. The results showed that the high RAP RHMA could compose structures that can be used on medium and high volume traffic roads...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{this project}} is to {{evaluate}} the resilient modulus of asphalt mixes containing various proportions of recycled asphalt. The resilient modulus is an important parameter used in the Austroads mechanistic design procedure and is {{an indicator of the}} potential fatigue life of a pavement. This study seeks to verify the current guidelines for asphalt recycling in Australia and also previous experimental work. It will supplement existing data and may inspire further research. The mix design tested was a <b>dense</b> <b>grade</b> 20 mm base course, in batches comprised of 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 % recycled material. For the 30, 45 and 60 % mixes, the bitumen binder was lowered by one grade to assess how effectively this compensates for the recycled binder ageing. The indirect tensile test method AS 2891. 13. 1 was used to determine the resilient modulus of the asphalt samples. In general, it was found that increasing the proportion of recycled material increased the resilient modulus, which agreed with previous studies. However, it was found that there was {{a significant increase in the}} modulus of the 15 % mix, despite claims that this should not significantly affect pavement performance. It was also found that lowering the binder grade could potentially overcompensate for the hardened binder, producing softer pavements, which could be at increased risk of rutting. It was concluded that the current Australian guidelines are not sufficient to make the most effective use of recycled asphalt and further studies are required. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of crumb rubber in asphalt mixture has significantly {{evolved in the}} past few decades. However, the modification through dry process method has been a far less popular compared to the wet process due to a few drawbacks that affect its performance. One such concern that is often ignored by researcher relates to the rubber–bitumen interaction that causes swelling of the rubber particles within compacted asphalt mixture. Rubber–bitumen interaction refers to the absorption of bitumen particularly the maltenes fraction by rubber particles. This study investigated the effects of mixture design variables on the rubber–bitumen interaction and properties of rubberized asphalt mixtures fabricated through the dry method. The effects of rubber–bitumen interaction at different rubber sizes, bitumen contents, and curing periods were investigated using the “Basket Drainage Method”. While, the mechanical properties of rubberized asphalt mixtures were measured using resilient modulus and dynamic creep tests. Four types of gyratory compacted specimens of a <b>dense</b> <b>grade</b> mixture of asphaltic concrete were fabricated. The four specimen types comprised a control specimen without rubber and three other specimens with 2 % crumb rubber of varying sizes (1. 18, 3. 35 and 5. 0 mm). Results showed that higher rubber–bitumen interaction can be obtained with the use of fine rubber size and high bitumen content, thus exhibiting greater rubber swelling particularly in the first 4 h of curing. Specimen with fine rubber can be easily compacted to achieve the target density which shows consistency in the volumetric properties. The addition of crumb rubber reduces the resilient and creep modulus of asphalt mixtures compared to the control mix. However, by initiating the rubber swelling extensively prior to compaction can possibly improve the compatibility and volumetric properties, thus enhancing better performance of the rubberized asphalt mixtures...|$|R

50|$|The {{deformation}} resistant {{capacity of}} SMA {{stems from a}} coarse stone skeleton providing more stone-on-stone contact than with conventional <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> asphalt (DGA) mixes (see above picture).

Addition of a small quantity of cellulose or mineral fibre prevents drainage of bitumen during transport and placement. There are no precise design guidelines for SMA mixes available in Europe. The essential features, which are the coarse aggregate skeleton and mastic composition, and the consequent surface texture and mixture stability, are largely determined by the selection of aggregate grading and the type and proportion of filler and binder. In the US, detailed mix design guidelines have been developed for SMA and published by the US National Asphalt Pavement Association in their Quality Improvement Publication QIP 122 as given in the references.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dense</b> <b>graded</b> {{mixtures}} {{are currently}} designed with a Texas Gyratory Compactor (TGC). The TGC has {{a relatively high}} compactive effort and unlike the Superpave Gyratory Compactor (SGC), the TGC compactive effort can not be varied to match the intended application. Therefore, the TGC tends to produce a dry lean mix regardless of the application. Ideally, one would want to design a richer mix for a low volume/low demand roadway and a leaner mix for a high volume/high demand roadway. More asphalt in the mix {{reduces the risk of}} cracking and less asphalt reduces the risk of rutting. It is possible to increase or decrease the amount of asphalt in the mixture by adjusting the target laboratory molded density down or up from the standard value of 96.0%. Seldom is the target lab density adjusted down from the standard of 96.0%; however, it is common practice to adjust the target laboratory molded density up to 97.0% or higher in order to get more asphalt into the mixture. This practice is acceptable and actually encouraged where warranted.

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{technique of}} titanium production is via the Kroll process which involves chlorination of TiO2 ore {{in the presence}} of carbon and reacting the resulting TiCl4 with magnesium to produce titanium sponge. These processes take place at temperatures as high as 1040 °C. The sponge particle range in size from 45 to 180 µm, with particles ~150 µm termed ‘sponge fines’. These fines are irregularly shaped and porous with a sponge-like morphology. The fines are then blended with alloy additions; cold compacted into a green compact at up to 415 MPa then vacuum sintered at 1260 °C to produce a 99.5% dense component. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) can further increase the density of these parts and produce components more economically than cast or wrought parts, but the porosity present in the material degrades fatigue and fracture properties. The BE approach has been used to produce valves for the Toyota Altezza, golf club heads and softball bats. More recently, close to 100% <b>dense</b> Ti <b>Grade</b> 5 parts has been achieved using a hydrided powder along with 60:40 Al:V master alloy.

Many {{studies have suggested that}} cortical functions must be shaped or emerge from the pattern of underlying physical (white matter) connectivity. Despite the importance of this hypothesis, {{there has not been a}} large-scale analysis of the white-matter connectivity within and between these associative cortices. Thus, we explored the pattern of intra- and inter-lobe white matter connectivity between multiple areas defined in each lobe. We defined 43 regions of interest on the lateral associative cortex cytoarchitectonically (6 regions of interest – ROIs in the frontal lobe and 17 ROIs in the parietal lobe) and anatomically (20 ROIs in the temporal lobe) on individuals' native space. The results demonstrated that intra-region connectivity for all 3 lobes was <b>dense</b> and <b>graded</b> generally. In contrary, the inter-lobe connectivity was relatively discrete and regionally specific such that only small sub-regions exhibited long-range connections to another lobe. The long-range connectivity was mediated by 6 major associative white matter tracts, consistent with the notion that these higher cognitive functions arises from brain-wide distributed connectivity. Using graph-theory network analysis we revealed five physically-connected sub-networks, which correspond directly to five known functional networks.
