40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of six cultivars named Cubano, Niger, Cubano 2032, 9277, 7551 and, 7566, of kenaf and three {{harvesting}} time stages on pulp and handsheet paper properties of kenaf, which were accomplished in north of Iran. Six cultivars of an Iranian kenaf (Hibiscus Cannabinus L.), were planted on 19 May 2007, and harvested at 85, 105, and 135 days after planting. It was understood that {{with the increase of}} plant age, the fiber yield increased. Maximum yield at each of three harvesting time stages was related to Niger. Consequently, if a high fiber yield is sought, Niger can be recommended. But if a paper with high strength properties is to be requested, Cubano 2032 is strongly associated with significant burst, tear, breaking length, and <b>fold</b> <b>endurance</b> even though its yield shows a bit lesser than Niger at short harvesting times. Moreover, at second harvesting time stage, maximum strength properties of handsheets such as burst, tear, breaking length, and <b>fold</b> <b>endurance</b> were related to Cubano, though the fiber yield of this cultivar was a bit lesser than Niger, but it was still more than Cubano 2032.

30|$|Paper of {{very low}} DP has low <b>fold</b> <b>endurance</b> and tensile {{strength}} and is experienced by readers as brittle {{and difficult to}} handle. Therefore, it could be assumed {{that there is an}} association between DP and the occurrence of physical changes associated with mechanical properties over a given number of challenges (e.g. tears, loose sheets, missing pieces and folds which result in breaks). It could also be assumed that there is an association between DP and the extent of use required before such changes become classed as damage. Such a function, combined with the frequency of use in an experimental case study, may reveal that regardless of its brittleness, a document could continue to be fit for a considerable length of time if the frequency of its use (reading, display) is low. In other words, if a document is not used at all, its brittleness is not a concern. This paper thus addresses the accumulation of wear and tear.|$|R
50|$|A double fold is {{a process}} of folding a paper sample first {{backwards}} and then forwards about the same line, i.e. one complete oscillation.

Highly impermeable {{wood of the}} Rocky Mountain variety was termed "refractory," while the pervious wood of the Pacific Coastal variety was termed "permeable. " Under constant pulping conditions, refractory Douglas-fir underwent less delignification than permeable Douglas-fir, giving higher screened rejects and lower screened yields. Pulp made from refractory Douglas-fir required less refining to achieve a given level of Canadian Standard Freeness. Handsheet properties were direct functions of fiber characteristic variations. Paper made from refractory Douglas-fir heartwood had greater sheet density, tensile strength, zero-span tensile strength, stretch, and <b>fold</b> <b>endurance.</b> Paper made from permeable Douglas-fir had greater internal tear resistance and a higher sheet brightness.

Attempts to grow indigenous trees as timber plantations have so far proven economically unviable compared to exotics, but more research is needed. A promising species is the fast-growing Trema orientalis which is appropriate for paper and pulp production; producing paper with good tensile strength and <b>folding</b> <b>endurance.</b> Another species for closer study is Celtis africana, which is fast-growing and can be used for furniture and panelling.

The Raman spectra of the two fibers indicate that there were not large changes {{in the formation of the}} chromophores responsible for color of the papers and the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose in the fiber during the cycling. The Py-GC analyses of the fibers illustrate that a large amount of rosin sizes and/or polyacrylamides remained in the recyded fiber, which interfered the formation of hydrogen bonds among the fibers so that the <b>folding</b> <b>endurance</b> of the formed papers were small. The crystallinity of the recycled fiber was larger than that of the virgin fiber, and did not change very much during the {{accelerated aging}}.

The neutral and alkaline papers retained their folding endurances well and significantly lost their yellow color (b*) during storage. The <b>folding</b> <b>endurance</b> of the acidic papers stored more than 15 years showed a declining trend with increased storage time.

A larger amount of the sizing agents correlated with less <b>folding</b> <b>endurance</b> and more yellow color of the papers. The relation between the starch content and the degree of yellow color of the papers was unclear, and the endurance of the papers increased with the increase in starch content.|$|E

The performance of this sample was analysed by using <b>folding</b> <b>endurance</b> tester with hot air chamber, adopting the Design of Experiment L 9 (3 4) Taguchi Method for the selected factors which are temperature, relative humidity, breaking time and motor speed. All of these factors were selected with a constant force.

For Signal to Noise ratio, the result showed that the temperature was the most influential factor for humidity effects and hot air environment, whereby the Signal to Noise ratio value obtained for the humidity and hot air environment are 129. 5 dBi and 130. 5 dBi respectively.
