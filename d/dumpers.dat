25|$|Cantilever three-spar {{structure}} of modified trapezoid planform. Centre section integral with fuselage. Inboard sections, outboard sections and detachable leading and trailing edges. High-lift devices comprise full-span six-segment {{leading edge slats}} (contiguous at engine pylons) at up to 17.5% of chord (drooping to 35°), two-segment fixed-vane double-slotted trailing edge flaps occupying some 75% of the span (deploying to 40°) and five-segment spoilers (outboards used as spoilerons at high speeds, inboards used as lift <b>dumpers</b> on the ground). Two-segment outboard ailerons for low speed roll control. Boundary layer fences over pylons. Engines suspended from the wing on pylons act as anti-flutter weights. Trim range is 16–33% of mean aerodynamic chord.|$|E
5000|$|In 1893, Timothy Long {{filed for}} a patent on a rotary car <b>dumper.</b> [...] This <b>dumper</b> {{required}} the car to be uncoupled because the <b>dumper</b> rolled {{the car to the}} side as it dumped.In 1901, Erskine Ramsay filed {{for a patent}} on a rotary <b>dumper</b> where the center of rotation of the <b>dumper</b> was aligned with the coupling. [...] When combined with railway couplers that were free to rotate, this permitted dumping cars without uncoupling them from the train.|$|R

2500|$|Most thermal {{stations}} use coal as {{the main}} fuel. Raw coal is transported from coal mines to a power station site by trucks, barges, bulk cargo ships or railway cars. Generally, when shipped by railways, the coal cars are sent as a full train of cars. The coal received at site may be of different sizes. The railway cars are unloaded at site by rotary <b>dumpers</b> or side tilt <b>dumpers</b> to tip over onto conveyor belts below. The coal is generally conveyed to crushers which crush the coal to about [...] size. The crushed coal is then sent by belt conveyors to a storage pile. Normally, the crushed coal is compacted by bulldozers, as compacting of highly volatile coal avoids spontaneous ignition.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, foreign {{trawlers}} began illegally fishing Somalia's seas, {{with an estimated}} $300 million of tuna, shrimp, and lobster being taken each year, depleting stocks previously available to local fishermen. Through interception with speedboats, Somali fishermen tried to either dissuade the <b>dumpers</b> and trawlers or levy a [...] "tax" [...] on them as compensation, as Segule Ali's previously mentioned quote notes. Peter Lehr, a Somalia piracy expert at the University of St. Andrews, says [...] "It's almost like a resource swap", Somalis collect up to $100 million a year from pirate ransoms off their coasts and the Europeans and Asians poach around $300 {{million a year in}} fish from Somali waters. The UK's Department for International Development (DFID) issued a report in 2005 stating that, between 2003 and 2004, Somalia lost about $100 million in revenue due to illegal tuna and shrimp fishing in the country's exclusive economic zone by foreign trawlers.|$|E

The goal of this project was to design, construct, and test a custom fabricated RPC <b>dumper</b> that will decrease {{the number of people}} needed to dump RPCs and also the amount of damage on the oranges when being dumped from the RPC by hand. The finished RPC <b>dumper</b> functions well, it dumps 4 RPCs per minute and is portable in that it can be moved by both pallet jack and fork lift. The RPC <b>dumper</b> also functions well in that it reduces the velocity change that the fruit sees by 80 % and also decreases the impact duration by 38 %...|$|R

50|$|A Helix <b>Dumper</b> is a rail {{transport}} and unloading solution, designed for continuous rolling discharge of bulk commodities. Originally {{developed for the}} iron ore industry, the Helix <b>Dumper</b> system can handle many types of fine-grained and potentially sticky commodities.When the Helix <b>Dumper</b> wagon enters the unloading area, a wheel {{at the top of}} the wagon makes contact with the spiral-shaped rigid guide that constitutes the unloading station. As the wheel travels along the path of the guide, the wagon chassis remains on the rails while the body of the wagon is rotated 148 degrees to dump its load. After the rotation, the direction of the guide changes and the wagon body is returned to its normal position. The Helix <b>Dumper</b> has a discharge rate of up to 25,000 tonnes per hour.|$|R
50|$|By 1921, the Car Dumper Equipment Company was {{offering}} {{a wide variety}} of rotary <b>dumpers,</b> including not only standard gauge <b>dumpers,</b> but also <b>dumpers</b> for use on mine railways; some of the latter were designed to dump an entire train in one operation.|$|E
50|$|Lift <b>dumpers</b> {{are almost}} always {{deployed}} automatically on touch down. The flight deck control has three positions: off, automatic ('armed'), and manual (rarely used). On landing approach 'automatic' is selected and, {{at the moment of}} touchdown, lift <b>dumpers</b> are deployed in a fraction of a second, with flight control spoilers also being raised automatically as additional lift <b>dumpers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lift <b>dumpers</b> are {{a special}} type of spoiler {{extending}} along {{much of the}} wing's length and designed to dump as much lift as possible on landing. Lift <b>dumpers</b> have only two positions, deployed and retracted. Lift <b>dumpers</b> have three main functions: putting most {{of the weight of}} the aircraft on the wheels for maximum braking effect, increasing form drag, and preventing aircraft 'bounce' on landing.|$|E

50|$|Modern <b>dumpers</b> have {{payloads}} {{of up to}} 10 t {{and usually}} steer by articulating at {{the middle of the}} chassis (pivot steering). They have multi-cylinder diesel engines, some turbocharged, electric start and hydraulics for tipping and steering and are usually four-wheel drive. An A-frame known as a ROPS (Roll-Over Protection) frame, may be fitted over the seat to protect the driver if the dumper rolls over. Some <b>dumpers</b> have FOPS (Falling Object Protection) as well. Lifting skips are available for discharging above ground level. In the 1990s <b>dumpers</b> with swivel skips, which could be rotated to tip sideways, became popular, especially for working in narrow sites such as road works. <b>Dumpers</b> are {{the most common cause of}} accidents involving construction plant.|$|E
50|$|Muir-Hill {{moved on}} to {{producing}} <b>dumpers</b> also based on Fordson tractor skid units.

40|$|The HHE Program {{evaluated}} {{concerns about}} injuries to an interment crew at a cemetery. Investigators spoke with employees {{about their health}} and safety concerns and measured the distance employees had to reach to operate equipment controls. Most operators' feet did not touch the foot controls when their back was against the backrest of the <b>dumper,</b> causing a larger portion of the forces from vehicle vibration to be absorbed through the seat and into the buttocks, pelvis, and torso. Whole body vibration measurements were taken during operation of a 10 -ton power tip <b>dumper</b> and backhoe. Investigators also compared whole body vibration exposures during different driving speeds and loading conditions and found that higher speeds on the <b>dumper</b> produced more whole body vibration. Interment employees were exposed to whole body vibration due to {{the configuration of the}} <b>dumper</b> and the condition of the roadways and soil shed area. Investigators concluded that operating the <b>dumper</b> caused more whole body vibration than operating the backhoe. HHE Program investigators recommended that the employer restrict driving speeds of the <b>dumper</b> and backhoe by either installing a governor device on the equipment or by establishing a speed policy for employees. Roadways should be improved and maintained regularly and the unpaved soil shed area and access roadways leading to the area should be graded more often. Investigators also recommended rotating employees through tasks on the <b>dumper</b> and backhoe more frequently. Suggested citation: NIOSH [2013].
