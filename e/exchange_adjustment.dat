40|$|Abstract This study {{tries to}} show empirically the short-run {{monetary}} effects of commodity exports price {{changes on the}} nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> in Indonesia via money supply and domestic inflation rate for the period 1999 to 2012. It is concentrated on commodity oil and an average of {{the rate of change}} in the world price of four main commodity exports (oil, rubber, palm oil, plywood). This study examines {{the extent to which the}} rate of depreciation or appreciation of the Indonesia???s currency, rupiah, has responded to the world price changes of these commodities. Based on the monetary approach to nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustments,</b> this study used the analytical model of Edwards (1986) as well as Reviane (1992) which looks at interactions among commodity export prices, money creation, inflation, and the nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment.</b> In case for cil commodity, this study finds that the changes in the world price of oil has positive effect to the money growth only, but has not influenced the nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> directly and indirectly through money creation and the domestic inflation. However, in case of three commodities (rubber, palm oil, plywood) has positive effect to the money growth, and has negative effect to the nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> directly and indirectly through money creation and the domestic inflation. Finally, in case of four commodities (oil, rubber, palm oil, plywood) finds that changes in the average of the world price of rubber, palm oil and plywood together with oil price changes have negative effect only to the nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment.</b> The implication of this study is that, for Indonesia, the world price of oil is no longer plays a dominant role on their nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment.</b> On the other hand, the policy-makers should fully sterilized the accumulation of international reserves when the world price of main commodity export increases...|$|R

These countries are Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu. The study explains that the present exchange rate regimes-comprising pegging to a basket of currencies for five countries and the floating arrangement for Papua New Guinea-have generally succeeded in avoiding inflationary, balance of payments, external debt, and financial system problems. The study concludes that adopting a common currency in the Pacific would require greater convergence of domestic policies and substantial strengthening of regional policies, which would take time to achieve.

40|$|A dynamic dependent-economy {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to investigate the}} role of the real exchange rate in determining the effects of foreign aid. If capital is perfectly mobile between sectors, untied aid has no longrun impact on the real exchange rate. A decline in the traded sector occurs because aid, being denominated in traded output, substitutes for exports in financing imports. While untied aid causes short-run real exchange appreciation, this response is very temporary and negligibly small. Tied aid, by influencing sectoral productivity, does generate permanent relative price effects. The analysis, which employs extensive numerical simulations, emphasizes the tradeoffs between real <b>exchange</b> <b>adjustments,</b> long-run capital accumulation, and economic welfare, associated with alternative forms of foreign aid.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{relationship}} between the demand for international reserves and <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustments</b> is empirically investigated for agroup of LDC's. It is shown that countries that have maintained a fixed exchange rate {{for a long period of}} time have a different demand function than countries that have occasionally used <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustments</b> for correcting payments imbalances. The dynamics of the adjustment for both groupsof countries are also analyzed. The results show that while both groups tend to eliminate reserve disequilibria fast, those countries that have maintained a fixed rate tend to do it more slowly than countries that have occasionally devalued their currency. It Is also shown that the year prior to a devaluation, international reserves have been, on average, 30 % below their short-run desired level. These results are important since they indicate that not all LDC's should be aggregated for prediction purposes.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an analytical}} model {{to evaluate the}} costs and benefits of a single currency area within a unified framework, inspired by the separate arguments of Mundell (1961) and (1973).

In our model, a single currency area, as compared with a system of national currencies and floating exchange rates, brings both welfare costs associated with the absence of <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> and welfare benefits associated with risksharing. The model provides a utility-based comparison of costs versus benefits. While theoretically, either monetary regime may dominate, quantitatively, the net welfare benefits of a single currency area are likely to be negative. ...|$|R

The existence of the band implies a discrete nonlinear real <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> process: Inside the band, where there are no arbitrage opportunities, the real exchange rate exhibits no central tendency; arbitrage activity translates into fast real <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> outside the band.

40|$|The {{influential}} work of Obstfeld and Rogoff {{argues that}} a closing-up of the US current account deficit involves a large <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment.</b> However, the Obstfeld-Rogoff model works exclusively via demand-side channels and abstracts from possible supply-side changes. We extend the framework to allow for endogenous supply-side changes and show that this fundamentally alters the mechanism of the adjustment process. Allowing for such an extension attenuates quite significantly the implied <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment.</b> The paper also provides some empirical evidence of variations in the supply-side structure and correlations with the exchange rate and the current account. The policy implications are that measures to foster a supply-side reaction would facilitate the external adjustment by alleviating an exclusive reliance on demand and exchange rate changes, with the latter being potentially destabilising for the global financial system.

However, in the presence of contagion across countries, all currency union members have a vested interest in liquidity supply from the central bank.

40|$|This article {{provides}} an analytical {{discussion of the}} adjustment to EU accession for an economy under alternative assumptions about monetary policy rules. The post-accession phase is characterized by rapid capital inflows and real exchange rate appreciation. If accession is combined with membership of the euro area and a pegged exchange rate, then the post-accession period exhibits excessive foreign borrowing, high wage inflation, an excessive stock market boom, and much too rapid growth in the non-traded sector {{at the expense of}} the exportable goods sector. Alternative monetary policies can be used to eliminate the inefficiencies of the post-accession adjustment, but some bring real costs in terms of lower growth and unemployment. We find that the best policy is one of flexible inflation targeting with some weight on exchange rate stability. In the absence of <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment,</b> fiscal policy could be used, but this requires complicated time-varying expenditure taxes. While the analytical discussion emphasizes the benefits of <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment,</b> a later section of the article explores some more recent arguments regarding non-traditional costs of exchange rate volatility.

40|$|The {{persistence}} of aggregate real exchange rates is a prominent puzzle, particularly since adjustment of international relative prices in microeconomic data is much faster. This paper finds that {{adjustment to the}} law of one price in disaggregated data is not just a faster version of the adjustment to purchasing power parity in the aggregate data; while aggregate real <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> works primarily through the foreign <b>exchange</b> market, <b>adjustment</b> in disaggregated data is a qualitatively distinct process, working through adjustment in local-currency goods prices. These distinct adjustment dynamics appear to arise from distinct classes of shocks generating macro and micro price deviations. A vector error correction model nesting aggregate and disaggregated relative prices permits identification of distinct macroeconomic and good-specific shocks. When half-lives are estimated conditional on shocks, the macro-micro disconnect puzzle disappears: microeconomic relative prices adjust to macro shocks just as slowly as do aggregate real exchange rates. These results provide evidence against theories of real exchange rate behavior based on sticky prices and on heterogeneity across goods. Foreign exchange rates; Purchasing power parity; Prices...|$|R
