A theist might answer: God is an {{infinite}} person, or at least {{an infinite}} <b>personal</b> <b>being.</b> Hick disagrees: "God cannot be both a person and infinite. " Moreover, he says, the distinction between being a person and <b>being</b> a <b>personal</b> <b>being</b> "is a distinction without a difference. " Thus, God cannot be an infinite <b>personal</b> <b>being</b> either. In this essay, I assess Hick's reasons for drawing these conclusions...|$|R

This phrase is reminiscent of Winnicott's idea of the importance of being able to be 'alone in the presence of another'. The client comes to eventually feel recognised, accepted and understood as who they are; their sense of <b>personal</b> <b>being,</b> or self, is fostered; and they can start to drop the destructive defenses which disrupt their sense of <b>personal</b> <b>being.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A few liberal Christian theologians, {{define a}} [...] "nontheistic God" [...] as [...] "the ground of all being" [...] {{rather than as}} a <b>personal</b> divine <b>being.</b> John Shelby Spong refers to a theistic God as [...] "a <b>personal</b> <b>being</b> with {{expanded}} supernatural, human, and parental qualities, which has shaped every religious idea of the Western world." ...|$|R

The Taoists, indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naïve for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.|$|R

50|$|Some atheists {{hold the}} view that the various conceptions of gods, such as the {{personal}} god of Christianity, are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities. Such atheists present deductive arguments against the existence of God, which assert the incompatibility between certain traits, such as perfection, creator-status, immutability, omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence, omnibenevolence, transcendence, personhood (a <b>personal</b> <b>being),</b> nonphysicality, justice, and mercy.|$|R
5000|$|Boström claims Plato as {{the source}} of these metaphysical presuppositions. Boström interprets Plato as having {{conceived}} a limited precursor of his own philosophy, constricted by his Paganism. In Plato, the [...] ideas constitute the absolute, whereas Boström stresses the need to move beyond the ideas to that being whose sensations they are. Boström takes himself to show that all spiritual reality necessarily refers to self-consciousness as its principle, and he maintains that true reality is personal and hence that philosophy is the science of <b>personal</b> <b>beings</b> as such, since some such thing as pure self-consciousness only exists in the abstract, whereas everything real is individual or fully determined self-consciousness (consciousness of something), or in other words, sensational being or person. Philosophy can deal with an impressional reality only insofar as this reality is conceived as a determination (sensation) for a <b>personal</b> <b>being</b> and is explained through it.|$|R
5000|$|He {{distinguished}} between negating or negative mysticism (making {{contact with an}} impersonal force) and affirming or affirmative mysticism (making contact with a <b>personal</b> <b>being).</b> <b>He</b> upheld that God is a <b>personal</b> <b>being</b> with whom human beings could interact. He wrote in The Trail of Life in the Middle Years, [...] "The essential characteristic of mysticism is the attainment of a personal conviction by an individual that the human spirit and the divine Spirit have met, have found each other, and are in mutual and reciprocal correspondence as spirit with Spirit." [...] At {{the same time that}} he {{distinguished between}} negative and affirmative mysticism, he asserted that all negative mystics occasionally take the affirmative approach and that all affirmative mystics tread the negative path from time to time. He exerted a major influence on the life and work of theologian Howard Thurman, who studied with him in 1929-30.|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to examine the value of personhood as a means of {{engaging}} questions of divine and human existence, knowledge, and action within a unified conceptual horizon. The intent is to demonstrate that the notion of 2 ̆ 2 <b>personal</b> <b>being</b> 2 ̆ 2 is ideally suited to serve as a guiding heuristic for thinking about God, humanity, the world, and the relations between them. The project is necessarily limited to, first, the explication of an appropriate methodology and, second, the application of this method to fundamental theological questions. The former involves an examination of the post-critical philosophy of Michael Polanyi and an assessment of its usefulness as a foundation for personalistic theological inquiry. The latter involves the deployment of insights gained from the analysis of Polanyi 2 ̆ 7 s thought in an examination of trinitarian theology, Christology, and pneumatology. The dissertation begins with a review of the details of Polanyi 2 ̆ 7 s theory of knowledge (chapter one). This opens the way for a consideration of the wider philosophical ramifications engendered by Polanyi 2 ̆ 7 s thought, which in turn makes possible the development of a Polanyian understanding of <b>personal</b> <b>being</b> (chapter two). The reception of Polanyi 2 ̆ 7 s work within contemporary theological studies is then reviewed and the contributions of those who have made significant use of his thought are noted (chapter three). Following these more descriptive efforts, the study then shifts to a more constructive attempt at elucidating a theological vision grounded in a Polanyian understanding of <b>personal</b> <b>being.</b> This first involves an examination of several of the more methodological issues involved in theological inquiry, including questions of truth, language, and the relationship between theology and philosophy (chapter four). Drawing on the consequences of previous chapters (and in particular on the Polanyian understanding of <b>personal</b> <b>being</b> refined throughout the project), the study then moves to an examination of the elaboration of the personalistic, Polanyian perspective engendered therein relative to the doctrine of both the immanent Trinity and the economic Trinity. A brief conclusion outlines several avenues for further study, and three appendices provide supplemental information about Polanyi 2 ̆ 7 s life and philosophical work...|$|R

The Taoists, indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naive for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it. Similar grounds have been found for questioning much of the philosophy behind traditional Chinese medicine, which, derived mainly from Taoist philosophy, reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. Because its theory predates use of the scientific method, it has received various criticisms based on scientific thinking. Even though there are physically verifiable anatomical or histological bases for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians, for instance skin conductance measurements show increases at the predicted points.|$|R
