6000|$|Madeline {{during these}} two days {{said no more}} about the London doctor; but it was plain to all who watched her that her anxiety as to the patient was much more keen {{than that of the}} other ladies of the house. [...] "She always thinks <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to die," [...] Lady Staveley said to Miss Furnival, intending, not with any consummate prudence, to account to that acute young lady for her daughter's solicitude. [...] "We had a cook here, three months since, who was very ill, and Madeline would never be easy till the doctor assured her that the poor woman's danger was {{altogether}} past." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{continued}} more {{quietly and}} impressively. 'Yes, Elfride, she is wealthy {{in comparison with}} us, though with few connections. However, she will introduce you to the world a little. We are going to exchange her house in Baker Street for one at Kensington, for your sake. <b>Everybody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> there now, she says. At Easters we shall fly to town for the usual three months--I shall have a curate of course by that time. Elfride, I am past love, you know, and I honestly confess that I married her for your sake. Why a woman of her standing should have thrown herself away upon me, God knows. But I suppose her age and plainness were too pronounced for a town man. With your good looks, if you now play your cards well, you may marry anybody. Of course, a little contrivance will be necessary; but there's nothing to stand between you and a husband with a title, that I can see. Lady Luxellian was only a squire's daughter. Now, don't you see how foolish the old fancy was? But come, she is indoors waiting to see you. It {{is as good as}} a play, too,' continued the vicar, as they walked towards the house. 'I courted her through the privet hedge yonder: not entirely, you know, but we used to walk there of an evening--nearly every evening at last. But I needn't tell you details now; everything was terribly matter-of-fact, I assure you. At last, that day I saw her at Stratleigh, we determined to settle it off-hand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain? Gone overboard, {{after getting}} {{us into this}} mess." [...] The mate, too, for all he knew or cared. Another fool. Didn't matter. <b>Everybody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> by-and-by.|$|R
60|$|Luckily <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> away. The Criches never stayed long at home. By dinner-time, Gerald {{was left}} quite alone. Even Winifred was carried off to London, {{for a few}} days with her sister Laura.|$|R
6000|$|I remarked [...] "that <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to Rougetnoirbourg this year; and I {{heard of}} two gentlemen--Count Carambole and Colonel Cannon--who had been obliged to sleep {{there on a}} billiard-table {{for want of a}} bed." ...|$|R
60|$|Running to see {{fireworks}} alone, rushing off {{to examine}} Bosjesmen by one's self, is a dreary work: I should think very few men {{would have the}} courage to do it unattended, and personally would not prefer a pipe in their own rooms. Hence if Clive went to see all these sights, as he did, it is to be concluded that he went in company; and if he went in company and sought it, we may suppose that little affair which annoyed him at Baden no longer tended to hurt his peace of mind very seriously. The truth is, our countrymen are pleasanter abroad than at home; most hospitable, kindly, and eager to be pleased and to please. You see a family half a dozen times in a week in the little Roman circle, whom you shall not meet twice in a season afterwards in the enormous London round. When Easter is over and <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> away at Rome, you and your neighbour shake hands, sincerely sorry to part: in London we are obliged to dilute our kindness so that there is hardly any smack of the original milk. As one by one the pleasant families dropped off with whom Clive had spent his happy winter; as Admiral Freeman's carriage drove away, whose pretty girls he had caught at St. Peter's kissing St. Peter's toe; as Dick Denby's family ark appeared with all Denby's sweet young children kissing farewells to him out of the window; as those three charming Miss Baliols with whom he had that glorious day in the Catacombs; as friend after friend quitted the great city with kind greetings, warm pressures of the hand, and hopes of meeting in a yet greater city {{on the banks of the}} Thames, young Clive felt a depression of spirit. Rome was Rome, but it was pleasanter to see it in company; our painters are smoking still at the Oafs Greco, but a society all smoke and all painters did not suit him. If Mr. Clive is not a Michael Angelo or a Beethoven, if his genius is not gloomy, solitary, gigantic, shining alone, like a lighthouse, a storm round about him, and breakers dashing at his feet, I cannot help myself: he is as Heaven made him, brave, honest, gay, and friendly, and persons of a gloomy turn must not look to him as a hero.|$|E
5000|$|AllMusic biographer Jason Lymangrover {{called the}} band's sound a merge of [...] "bombastic emo pop, post-hardcore, and thick, chunky indie rock".

The song was conceived during the recording of the album, and had not been written beforehand.

60|$|It {{was the day}} for {{the great}} parade of the {{returned}} soldiers, and New York City, especially {{in the vicinity of}} Fifth Avenue, was packed with dense crowds that filled miles of grandstands, windows, and other points of vantage, and also jammed the sidewalks and the side streets. It was a holiday for all, and <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to make the most of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|During that memorable month I {{basked in}} the {{happiness}} of being for once in my life drifting with the tide of a great popular movement. <b>Everybody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to Europe--I, too, <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to Europe. <b>Everybody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to the famous Paris Exposition--I, too, <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to the Paris Exposition. The steamship lines were carrying Americans out of the various ports of {{the country at the}} rate of four or five thousand a week in the aggregate. If I met a dozen individuals during that month who <b>were</b> not <b>going</b> to Europe shortly, I have no distinct remembrance of it now. I walked about the city a good deal with a young Mr. Blucher, who was booked for the excursion. He was confiding, good-natured, unsophisticated, companionable; but he was not a man to set the river on fire. He had the most extraordinary notions about this European exodus and came at last to consider the whole nation as packing up for emigration to France. We stepped into a store on Broadway one day, where he bought a handkerchief, and when the man could not make change, Mr. B. said: ...|$|R

[...] "It's a big adjustment to come to the NBA from Europe, but he is a hard worker." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{entitlement}} reform, {{he suggested}} cuts {{would have to}} be made. [...] "The first thing {{we need to do is}} acknowledge that <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to have to give on Social Security reform and Medicare reform," [...] he said. Walsh opposes the extension of unemployment benefits. He said the benefits have already been extended for too long and that attention should be paid to the cost. Following President Obama's State of the Union address, Walsh remarked that he did not believe there should be a social safety net because it is not in the Constitution.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the third}} novel, A Storm of Swords, Robb Stark is assassinated in an event called the Red Wedding, which was {{inspired}} by the Black Dinner and Glencoe Massacre from Scottish history. [...] George Martin has said that he decided to kill Robb Stark because he wished to keep the story difficult to predict: [...] "I killed Ned because everybody thinks he’s the hero ... The next predictable thing is to think his eldest son is going to rise up and avenge his father. And <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to expect that. So immediately Robb became the next thing I had to do." ...|$|E

Cam Lewis, the Editor-in-Chief who orchestrated the organization's shift, said {{the goal was to}} lead the way in a change in climate that <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to have to face eventually, citing a decline in ad revenue and an increase in the use of digital mediums as reasons for the change.|$|R

While campaigning in 2012, Love had said that if elected, she would “join the Congressional Black Caucus and try to take that thing apart from the inside out.” She described the mainly Democratic Caucus as characterized by...demagoguery. They sit there and ignite emotions and ignite racism when there isn’t. They use their positions to instill fear. Hope and change is turned into fear and blame. Fear that <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to lose everything and blaming Congress for everything instead of taking responsibility.|$|E

Everybody will — not just the young people. <b>Everybody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to say, 'Man, this stinks. I cannot tolerate the smell of this thing anymore.

It talked, in general terms, about how {{more and more of}} humanity gets sucked out of the daily life and more and more replaced by machine. It's not a new thing now, but then it was new. Humans versus machine, was the general vibe of the record." [...] The original cover concept was for a hologram of a metal heart, until budget considerations resulted in a traditional cover. But fittingly for the futuristic theme of the album, Metal Heart was the first Accept album to be digitally mastered.|$|E
