40|$|The plan {{presented}} in this document follows the cost-to-completion review of the LHC Programme and the subsequent reconsideration of activities and priorities. It contains considerable changes in the allocation of resources compared to the "The Scientific Activities and Budget Estimates for the Years 2002 - 2005 " (CERN/SPC/ 793 - CERN/FC/ 4424). Council is invited to: i) approve the overall figures proposed for 2003 so that the <b>detailed</b> <b>preliminary</b> 2003 <b>Draft</b> Budget can be prepared for presentation in September 2002; ii) {{take note of the}} proposed budget estimates for 2004, 2005 and 2006 and of the projections up to 2010; iii) give indications concerning long-term projections and scenarios so that a formal proposal for a revision of the 1996 decision on the LHC Project can be prepared for Council in December 2002...|$|R

40|$|With {{the fast}} {{development}} of communication systems, network security issues {{have more and}} more impact on daily life. It is essential to construct a high degree of optical layer security to resolve the security problem once and for all. Three different techniques which can provide optical layer security are introduced and compared. Optical chaos can be used for fast random number generation. Quantum cryptography is the most promising technique for key distribution. And the optical coding techniques can be deployed to encrypt the modulated signal in the optical layer. A mathematical equation has been derived from information theory to evaluate the information-theoretic security level of the wiretap channel in optical coding schemes. And the merits and limitation of two coherent optical coding schemes, temporal phase coding and spectral phase coding, have been analysed. The security scheme based on a reconfigurable optical coding device has been introduced, and the corresponding security protocol has been developed. By moving the encryption operation from the electronic layer to the optical layer, the modulated signals become opaque to the unauthorised users. Optical code distribution and authentication is the one of the major challenges for our proposed scheme. In our proposed protocol, both of the operations are covered and defined in <b>detail.</b> As a <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> of the optical code security protocol, it could be a useful guidance for further research...|$|R
