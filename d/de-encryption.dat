50|$|The most {{controversial}} {{provisions of the}} Anti-terrorism Act are the numerous new restrictions on the operation of internet and technology based companies, among which Article 21 says that an internet operator or provider is obligated to verify the identity of each user and shall refuse to provide services to a user who refuses such verification or fails to provide a clear identity. Any company who fails to meet such obligation may face fines, orders of rectification and its management and executives may face fines and even detentions from 5 to 15 days. In addition, Article 18 says any telecommunication operator or internet provider shall provide technology access and source code or other <b>de-encryption</b> support and assistance {{for the purposes of}} preventing and investigating terrorism by Public Safety Department or National Security Department.|$|E
50|$|Treasure of Lima: A Buried Exhibition {{is an art}} project {{curated by}} Nadim Samman for Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary Academy and {{commissioned}} by Francesca von Habsburg. Works by forty internationally celebrated artists were placed inside an exhibition architecture (that is, contemporary ‘treasure’ chest) designed by architects Aranda\Lasch and then buried at a secret location on Cocos Island in May 2014. The GPS coordinates (or ‘map’) of the exhibition location were logged {{at the site of}} burial. These coordinates were then given to the Dutch artist Constant Dullaart, who worked with a leading cryptographer to encode them. The resulting string of code was then made physical as a 3D printed steel cylinder and placed inside a second version of the chest. This chest will be auctioned to raise funds for a shark research and conservation initiative on Cocos Island. The buyer will not receive the <b>de-encryption</b> key.|$|E

40|$|DE 19907964 C UPAB: 20000907 NOVELTY - The {{encryption}} device provides an encrypted data stream from audio and/or video signals using a coder (204 - 210) {{which provides a}} data stream with a pre-defined syntax, coupled to an encryption stage (18). This uses an encryption key (k) for scrambling the output signal from the coder, so that the encrypted data stream contains useful information which differs from the useful information in the data stream at {{the output of the}} coder while maintaining the pre-defined syntax. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Also included are INDEPENDENT CLAIMS for the following: (a) a <b>de-encryption</b> device; (b) an encryption method for an audio and/or video signal; (c) a <b>de-encryption</b> method for an encrypted audio and/or video signal USE - The device is used for encryption of audio and/or video signals for copy-right protection.

40|$|Tissue factor (TF) is {{the main}} {{physiological}} initiator of blood coagulation and its activation or <b>de-encryption</b> within plasma membranes is important for trapping, extravasation and angiogenesis {{in the development and}} spread of solid malignancies. Multidrug resistance is also an adaptive response in malignant (and normal) cells. It is often mediated by the over-expression of the P-glycoprotein (P-gP) efflux pump. Both TF and P-gP tend to be expressed together, perhaps as part of a coherent 'crisis management' response of cells to environmental change or challenge. An associated feature in such a response appears to be the reversal of normal phospholipid charge asymmetry in the plasma membrane bilayer. Responses to environmental stimuli affect function in normal and malignant tissue. Uniting the study of TF expression or <b>de-encryption</b> and MDR- 1 phenotype would be biologically enlightening and might ultimately influence clinical cancer management and the control of thrombotic problems associated with treatment...|$|E
40|$|Tissue factor (TF, {{coagulation}} factor III, CD 142) {{is not only}} the main physiological initiator of normal blood coagulation, but is also important in the natural history of solid malignancies in that it potentiates metastasis and angiogenesis and mediates outside-in signalling. TF is expressed constitutively by many tissues which are not in contact with blood and by other cells upon injury or activation; the latter include endothelial cells, tissue macrophages, and peripheral blood monocytes. It can exist encrypted and unavailable functionally in the plasma membrane and the appearance of functional TF may be due to synthesis and/or <b>de-encryption.</b> Inflammatory cells often express TF and act to induce its production or <b>de-encryption</b> by other cells locally and, apparently, at remote sites. Inappropriate expression of TF by endothelial cells, macrophages or monocytes is thought to be an important trigger of coagulation in various pathological conditions. Several studies have shown that measurements of monocyte TF (mTF) may provide clinically significant information, particularly in patients with malignant and inflammatory diseases...|$|E
40|$|Tissue factor (TF) on cell {{surfaces}} resides {{mostly in}} a cryptic state. It {{is not entirely}} clear how cryptic TF differs from procoagu-lantly active TF and how deencryption oc-curs. Here, we critically evaluated the impor-tance of cystine 186 –cystine 209 (Cys 186 -Cys 209) bond formation for TF procoagulant activity and its <b>de-encryption.</b> Chinese ham-ster ovary cells transfected with TFC 186 S, TFC 209 S, or TFC 186 S/C 209 S expressed little procoagulant activity at the cell surface. TF monoclonal antibody and activated factor VII (FVIIa) binding studies showed that little TF protein {{was present at the}} cell surface in cells expressing mutant TF. Similar data were obtained in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) transduced to express TFC 186 S, TFC 209 S, or TFC 186 S/C 209 S. Analysis of TF activity in HUVECs expressing similar levels of wild-type TF and TFC 186 S/C 209 S showed that TF mutant in the presence of saturating con-centrations of FVIIa exhibited similar co-agulant activity as that of wild-type TF. More importantly, treatment of HUVECs expressing TFC 186 S/C 209 S with HgCl 2 or ionomycin increased the cell-surface TF activity to the same extent as that of the wild-type TF. Our data provide clear evidence that TF lacking the Cys 186 -Cys 209 bond is coagulantly active once it is complexed with FVIIa, and TF <b>de-encryption</b> does not require Cys 186 -Cys 209 disulfide bond formation.

40|$|Electrocardiography (ECG) is a noninvasive {{recording}} {{produced by}} anelectrocardiographic device {{which is a}} transthoracic interpretation of the electrical activity ofthe human's heart over time captured. From the data base of medical ECG signals forthousands of people, ECG seems to be irregular, random, and changing from person to person. Because of high randomness and complexity of ECG in human beings, its feature is extremelyhard and is likely impossible to be duplicated artificially. However, it has recently beenshown in the literature {{that the kind of}} signals is, in fact, chaotic. Because people's ECGs areextremely hard to be artificially duplicated, this project thus intends to investigate the way toextract the specific biometric features of ECG signals for possible use in the biometricpersonnel identification. Since the specific features of ECGs are difficult to be extracted fromthe time domain expression, the signal is converted into the phase plane and ECG chaosextractor is applied to capture the major indices of ECG chaos, i. e. Lyapunov exponentsspectrum, correlation dimension, central tendency, K-S entropy, etc. The features are thenused as the key input variables for neural networking training and used in a personalauthentication scheme. From the viewpoint of applications, the developed identifier would beappropriate for secure communication as well. After successful development of theECG-based personal authentication system, it will be incorporated with cryptography toperform chaotic encryption and <b>de-encryption</b> in secure communication. A hardware systemconsisting of sensors, ECG extractor, and post signal processing identifier will beimplemented to experimentally show the applicability of the proposed approach. 心電圖為記錄人體心肌細胞電性改變後，身體體液電位變化以非侵入方式擷取之資訊。數醫學ECG信號數據庫中顯示，每個人的ECG信號均極複雜且隨機變化，由於ECG信號的這種特質，因此個人ECG信號很難以人為方式變造複製。最近幾年國内外研究人員對生命循環系统的核心-ECG的非線性特性作了深入研究，研究論文顯示，心電訊號看似複雜，但卻顯現混沌動態特質，也就是ECG雖為非線性動態行為但具有特殊規律性。國際上關於ECG的相關研究均未涉及個人身份辨識的應用，基於此觀察，本研究嘗試以非線性心電訊號為研究對象，規劃此一研究主題，提出一種使用混沌心電訊號進行個人身份辨識的系統。由於心電訊號在時域上很難看出有什麼特徵，因此將心電訊號轉至相平面並利用混沌理論分析心電訊號狀態的關聯維數、李亞普若夫(Lyapunov) 指數譜與柯氏熵等三種特徵值，結合神經網路學習與辨識在人們不同生理條件下，如休息、和緩運動與劇烈運動等，所反映的心臟動力學整體特性，作為個人身份生物辨識的基礎。混沌系統具有寬頻功率頻譜、軌跡難以估測及近似隨機訊號的特性，因此廣泛被應用於通訊安全的研究。本研究亦從應用觀點，將所建構完成之混沌心電訊號身份辨識系統，結合密碼學，建構一個嶄新的私人安全通訊系統，將欲傳送的明文訊號加入私人的混沌心電訊號作編碼，利用混沌同步技術將加密的訊號傳送出去，接收端將加密訊號與另一個同步混沌心電訊號相減，使有意義的明文訊號還原，達到個人資料安全通訊的目的...|$|E
