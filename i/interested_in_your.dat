Essentially, if you have not slept or eaten adequately, you won't be <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> self-esteem desires. Subsequently, we have the second level, which awakens a need for security. After securing those two levels, the motives shift to the social sphere, the third level. Psychological requirements comprise the fourth level, while the top of the hierarchy consists of self-realization and self-actualization.|$|E

While the song played, the lead subject, an assault survivor, reminisced about the impact of rape while walking around a college campus.

Anyone who has that kind of platform to reach all sorts of people that maybe would not necessarily be inclined to be <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> issue... it's incredible." [...] "Til It Happens to You" [...] leaked onto the Internet before it was officially released, through an unofficial recording made at the film's premiere at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. In April 2015, Warren confirmed that the song would have an official release and was waiting for a final audio mixing by Gaga. It was later released as a digital download single on September 18, 2015.|$|E

2500|$|The album's {{opening track}} [...] "War Pigs" [...] was {{originally}} intended to be called [...] "Walpurgis". It was then changed to [...] "War Pigs", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that {{the song of the}} same name had potential as a single. [...] Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: [...] "I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' you know, the Satanic version of Christmas write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not going to call it that. Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'." [...] In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, [...] "It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis'... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> average 'I love you' pop song... Geezer also liked {{to put a lot of}} topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had his ear to the ground, Geezer did." ...|$|E

Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic highlighted the song as an album standout, calling it [...] "some of Madonna's {{best and most}} accomplished music". Rolling Stones [...] Arion Berger wrote: [...] "'Erotica' [...] promise a smorgasbord of sexual experimentation, like the one portrayed in the video for 'Justify My Love'. But the sensibility of 'Erotica' is miles removed from the warm come-ons of 'Justify', which got its heat from privacy and romance [...] The Madonna of 'Erotica' {{is in no way}} <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> dreams; she's after compliance"; he called the song [...] "'Vogue' with a dirty mouth, where all the real action's on the dance floor". [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times, commented that the [...] "foggy growl" [...] that Madonna uses in the spoken-word sections of the song [...] "contrast dramatically with the shrill little-kid voice from Madonna's earliest records that she still often uses to project a bratty teen-age exuberance". J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , wrote that [...] " [...] wasn't a surprise for anyone who had been paying attention to Madonna's recent music. She had shown her hand earlier with Breathless when she sang 'Hanky Panky', the song about spanking [...] then there was her single 'Justify My Love' [...] 'Erotica' though, was the full-blown music exploration, an exhibition, of what we were to believe was Madonna's sexual reality". Authors Allen Metz and Carol Benson, called it [...] "a bondage update on 'Justify My Love'". Matthew Jacobs from The Huffington Post, placed it at number 23 of his list [...] "The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles"; Jacobs wrote [...] "Released at the apex of Madonna's sex appeal, 'Erotica' and its accompanying title album are remarkable as a period of innovation for the singer".|$|E
