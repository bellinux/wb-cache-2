Using data collected from a free-elicitation method, this paper reports on the travel <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> aspirations of 284 Chinese students.

40|$|<b>Experiences</b> <b>and</b> {{expectations}} of discrimination (anticipated discrimination) may delay treatment seeking {{among people with}} substance use disorders. In addition, <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination can be a barrier to successful recovery and rehabilitation. The {{aim of this study}} was to study the level of <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated (the expectation to be rejected) discrimination among individuals in treatment for substance use disorders as well as the association between both concepts of discrimination. In addition, the association of <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination with clinical and social characteristics was investigated. A cross-sectional survey among individuals in treatment for substance use disorders in the Netherlands was carried out in 2012. Individuals in treatment (N = 186) completed a self-reported questionnaire about <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination. Descriptive statistics and chi-squared analyses were performed to investigate the level of <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination and the association between both concepts. Linear regression analyses were used to investigate the association with clinical and social characteristics, such as occupational status and type of treatment. Individuals in treatment for substance use disorders reported high levels of <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination. Respondents experienced most discrimination in family ties, intimate relationships <b>and</b> friendships. <b>Experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination were both positively correlated. Having complex substance use problems and a longer history of substance use problems was related to higher levels of experienced discrimination. In conclusion, <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination were highly prevalent among individuals in treatment for substance use disorders. Attention in addiction treatment for adequate coping with discrimination may be needed in order to achieve successful social participation and rehabilitation of these individuals...|$|R

5|$|Another {{reform was}} that Austria, having lost many officers, veteran and elite troops, and regulars, {{and unable to}} call on allies, embraced the Levée en masse used earlier by the French.

In a strange {{reversal}} of the earlier Napoleonic Wars, where Frenchmen with little <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> often pressed into service fought against the professional Austrian army, a massive amount of Austrian conscripts, with no <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> only basic training and equipment would be sent into the field against a highly trained, campaign-hardened, and well-equipped French Grande Armée.|$|E

40|$|Work-related {{subjective}} <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> work-related self-efficacy {{were investigated}} as candidate correlates of career learning {{among people with}} schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Work-related self-efficacy was expected to mediate any observed relationship between work-related subjective <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> employment status, after controlling for demographic, vocational, and clinical covariates. Baseline measures (n 1 = 104) were repeated at six months (n 2 = 94) and 12 months (n 3 = 94). Work-related subjective <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> work-related self-efficacy were consistently associated with current employment after controlling for covariates. The proposed mediator role of work-related self-efficacy remains a viable hypothesis requiring further investigation. Both work-related subjective <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> work-related self-efficacy appear promising as components of the social cognitive career learning theory to help explain career development among people with psychiatric disabilities...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Several studies report a {{positive}} association between adverse life <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> adult obesity. Despite the high comorbidity between binge eating disorder (BED) and obesity, few authors {{have studied the}} link between trauma and BED. In this review the association between exposure to adverse life <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> a risk {{for the development of}} obesity and BED in adulthood is explored. Methods Based on a scientific literature review in Medline, PubMed and PsycInfo databases, the results of 70 studies (N[*]=[*] 306, 583 participants) were evaluated including 53 studies on relationship between adverse life <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> obesity, 7 studies on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in relation to obesity, and 10 studies on the association between adverse life <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> BED. In addition, mediating factors between the association of adverse life <b>experiences,</b> obesity <b>and</b> BED were examined. Results The majority of studies (87 %) report that adverse life experiences are a risk factor for developing obesity and BED. More precisely a positive association between traumatic <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> obesity and PTSD and obesity were found, respectively, in 85 % and 86 % of studies. Finally, the great majority of studies (90 %) between trauma and the development of BED in adulthood strongly support this association. Meanwhile, different factors mediating between the trauma and obesity link were identified. Discussion and conclusions Although research data show a strong association between life adverse <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> the development of obesity and BED, {{more research is needed to}} explain this association...|$|R
