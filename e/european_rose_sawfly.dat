50|$|Sawflies {{are serious}} pests in horticulture. Different species prefer {{different}} host plants, often being specific {{to a family}} or genus of hosts. For example, Iris sawfly larvae, emerging in summer, can quickly defoliate species of Iris including the yellow flag and other freshwater species. Similarly the <b>rose</b> <b>sawflies,</b> Arge pagana and A. ochropus, defoliate rose bushes.|$|R

In the 19th century it was the most important species of rose to be cultivated, and most modern <b>European</b> <b>rose</b> cultivars have at least a small contribution from R. gallica in their ancestry.|$|R

50|$|Named for Damascus, Damask roses (Rosa × damascena) {{originated}} {{in ancient times}} with a natural hybrid (Rosa moschata × Rosa gallica) × Rosa fedtschenkoana. Robert de Brie is given credit for bringing damask roses from the Middle East to Europe sometime between 1254 and 1276, although there is evidence from ancient Roman frescoes {{that at least one}} damask rose existed in Europe for hundreds of years before this. Summer damasks bloom once in summer. Autumn or Four Seasons damasks bloom again later, albeit less exuberantly, and these were the first remontant (repeat-flowering) Old <b>European</b> <b>roses.</b> Damask roses tend to have rangy to sprawling growth habits and strongly scented blooms. Examples: 'Ispahan', 'Madame Hardy'.|$|R

50|$|Modern hybrids, {{including}} the hybrid teas, floribundas, grandifloras, modern miniatures, and English roses, have a complex genetic background that almost always includes China roses (which are descended from Rosa chinensis). China roses were evergrowing, everblooming roses from humid subtropical regions that bloomed constantly on any new vegetative growth produced {{during the growing}} season. Their modern hybrid descendants exhibit similar habits; unlike Old <b>European</b> <b>Roses,</b> modern hybrids bloom continuously (until stopped by frost) on any new canes produced during the growing season. They therefore require pruning back of any spent flowering stem in order to divert the plant's energy into producing new growth and hence new flowers.|$|R

50|$|As remontancy is {{considered}} a desirable horticultural characteristic, it is preferentially selected for by rose hybridisers. Remontant roses descended from Rosa chinensis have been grown in China {{for at least a}} thousand years, but the first garden roses in Europe to possess remontancy were the autumn damasks, which first appeared in the seventeenth century with the introduction of the cultivar 'Quatre Saisons'. Recent DNA research has shown that these damask roses resulted from crosses involving Rosa gallica, Rosa moschata and the remontant central Asian species Rosa fedtschenkoana. When forms of Rosa chinensis were introduced into Europe in the late eighteenth century, subsequent hybridisation between these and the <b>European</b> <b>roses</b> eventually led to the wide variety of remontant garden hybrids which are available today.|$|R

50|$|The Portland roses {{were long}} {{thought to be}} the first group of crosses between China <b>roses</b> and <b>European</b> <b>roses,</b> and to show the {{influence}} of Rosa chinensis. Recent DNA analysis however has demonstrated that the original Portland Rose has no Chinese ancestry, but has an autumn damask/gallica lineage. This group of roses was named after the Duchess of Portland who received (from Italy about 1775) a rose then known as R. paestana or 'Scarlet Four Seasons' Rose' (now known simply as 'The Portland Rose'). The whole class of Portland roses was developed from that one rose. The first repeat-flowering class of rose with fancy European-style blossoms, the plants tend to be fairly short and shrubby, with a suckering habit, with proportionately short flower stalks. The main flowering is in the summer, but intermittent flowers continue into the autumn. Examples: 'James Veitch', 'Rose de Rescht', 'Comte de Chambord'.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focussed on description of biology of gall wasps from the genus Diplolepis spp. (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) in the palearctic region {{with the emphasis}} on some interesting phenomenons in their life cycle. These wasps induce galls obligatory on roses (Rosa spp.) and are widely distributed in the holarctic region. Many authors focussed on research of parasitoids, which use wasps larvae as food source. It was also recognized that inquilines lost their ability to induce own galls. However, their development is still dependent on galls tissues, because they feed on cells within galls. Rose gall wasps reproduce mostly without any mating. Female lay unfertilized eggs and males are very rare. Recently, development of modern techniques enable authors to study infection by bacteria of the genus Wolbachia and its role in the wasps parthenogenetic development. It is also apparent difference between the levels of our knowledge about individual species in this bachelor thesis. We have relative rich knowledges about <b>European</b> <b>rose</b> gall wasps, on the other hand biology of some Asian species is still very poor...|$|R
