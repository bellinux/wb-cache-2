We study these models by a variety of techniques, such as Feynman graph <b>expansion,</b> <b>loop</b> equations, and sum over Young tableaux, and we obtain explicitly the leading 1 /N 2 corrections for the spectrum and correlators. These techniques are suggestive of possible dual bulk descriptions. At fixed order in 1 /N 2 the spectrum remains continuous and no recurrence occurs, so information loss persists. However, the interchange of the long-time and large-N limits is subtle and requires further study. ...|$|E

The thesis includes a critical review of both linear and non-linear fracture mechanics and a separate review of advanced structural reliability methods. An improved response surface method has been proposed in this research to conduct a reliability assessment where the structural behaviour is modelled and the J -integral is computed using finite element software.   Of particular interest has been the development of a methodology that is able to handle the non-linearities inherent in the material stress strain curve.   Although it was possible to develop a response surface to achieve a good fit in the region of FROM/SORM design point, it led to instability in the FORM/SORM implementation.   The research then focussed on the use of directional simulation as a solution technique for this class of problems. The material used {{in the construction of the}} <b>expansion</b> <b>loop</b> was AISI- 321 stainless steel and to model this correctly in the reliability-based assessment the full range stress-strain behaviour was required in FE analysis.   The material was tested in the laboratory and a new piecewise continuous stress-strain model has been developed which involves a linear-elastic part and two subsequent non-linear parts both of the Ramsberg-Osgood type.   For the purposes of reliability assessment a new stochastic stress-strain model has been developed taking into account uncertainties in yield strength and in operating temperatures, together with the associated yield strength – temperature dependency. An integral part of the research has  been a study of the J -integral profile along the crack front using 3 -D FE analysis, for a number of CT (Compact Tension), beam and CCT (Central Crack Tension) specimens, with a range of thickness.   This has brought new findings which are of importance in both deterministic and probabilistic assessment.

The system consists of four basic stages of refrigeration. The first stage is accomplished by an active refrigeration system.

Long-life adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators, helium desorption, or helium diaphragm compressors are used to cool to 4 K or below.

While both genetic and postpartum environmental exposure have been linked to ASD, prenatal maternal weight has not been investigated. The objective of the study is to assess whether overweight or obesity at pregnancy is an important risk factor for the diagnosis of ASD in offspring. A case-control study was designed to answer this question using the public health ecosocial theory. The study population consisted of 70 mothers, who were recruited via the Internet using the viral <b>expansion</b> <b>loop.</b> Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. No significant difference in risk of ASD by level of body mass index (BMI) was found after adjusting for covariates. The odds ratio for obese women in comparison to normal or underweight women was 1. 19, 95 % CI [0. 53, 2. 66] after adjusting for covariates. Gaining the appropriate amount of weight during gestation, as determined by the Institute of Medicine, was not associated with ASD either, with the odds ratio at 0. 67, 95 % CI [0. 31, 1. 48]. The results indicate that BMI category at pregnancy and gestational weight gain were not risk factors for autism in children. The implications for positive social change include a better understanding of maternal prenatal BMI as a risk factor for autism spectrum disorder.

40|$|On 14 July 1998 TRACE {{observed}} transverse oscillations of a coronal loop {{generated by}} an external disturbance most probably {{caused by a}} solar flare. These oscillations were interpreted as standing fast kink waves in a magnetic flux tube. Firstly, in this review we embark on {{the discussion of the}} theory of waves and oscillations in a homogeneous straight magnetic cylinder with the particular emphasis on fast kink waves. Next, we consider the effects of stratification, loop <b>expansion,</b> <b>loop</b> curvature, non-circular cross-section, loop shape and magnetic twist. An important property of observed transverse coronal loop oscillations is their fast damping. We briefly review the different mechanisms suggested for explaining the rapid damping phenomenon. After that we concentrate on damping due to resonant absorption. We describe the latest analytical results obtained with the use of thin transition layer approximation, and then compare these results with numerical findings obtained for arbitrary density variation inside the flux tube. Very often collective oscillations of an array of coronal magnetic loops are observed. It is natural to start studying this phenomenon from the system of two coronal loops. We describe very recent analytical and numerical results of studying collective oscillations of two parallel homogeneous coronal loops. The implication of the theoretical results for coronal seismology is briefly discussed. We describe the estimates of magnetic field magnitude obtained from the observed fundamental frequency of oscillations, and the estimates of the coronal scale height obtained using the simultaneous observations of the fundamental frequency and the frequency of the first overtone of kink oscillations.

Piping materials for geothermal systems have been of numerous types with great variation in cost and durability. The temperature and chemical quality of the geothermal fluids, in addition to cost, usually determine the type of piping network material used. In this paper, four suitable types of piping materials according to chemical quality and temperature of the fluid were taken into consideration for Meshkinshahr 50 MWe geothermal power plant pipelines. Pipelines consist of two lines that transport the mixture of brine and steam from wellhead to separators, two steam lines from separator to power house and two brine lines from separator to reinjection wellheads. The design parameters; number of <b>expansion</b> <b>loops</b> and legs, pressure drop, wall thickness, weight span. pipe weight and length of the pipe are variable with different pipe materials. Each parameter has a specific significance in each line. For example, in steam lines, pressure drop {{is more important than}} that in other lines and less pressure drop in steam lines lead to increase the inlet pressure of turbine and more output power. Also, these parameters directly affect the cost of piping, fewer <b>expansion</b> <b>loops</b> and legs lead to use less pipe length and less pressure drop, larger weight spans result in less pipe supporting costs, and different thicknesses make different pipe unit weight and different transportation costs.

The concurrency constructs in X 10 {{make it possible to}} express complex computation and communication structures with higher productivity than other distributed-memory programming models. However, this productivity often comes at the cost of high performance overhead when the language is used in its full generality. This paper introduces high-level compiler optimizations and transformations to reduce communication and synchronization overheads in distributed-memory implementations of X 10 programs. Specifically, we focus on locality optimizations such as scalar replacement and task localization, combined with supporting transformations such as loop distribution, scalar <b>expansion,</b> <b>loop</b> tiling, and loop splitting. We have completed a prototype implementation of these high-level optimizations, and performed a performance evaluation that shows significant improvements in performance, scalability, communication volume and number of tasks. We evaluated the communication optimizations on three platforms: a 128 -node BlueGene/P cluster, a 32 -node Nehalem cluster, and a 16 -node Power 7 cluster. On the BlueGene/P cluster, we observed a maximum performance improvement of 31. 46 × relative to the unoptimized case (for the MolDyn benchmark).

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Ground-water monitoring is the primary method used to protect our ground-water resources. The primary objectives of monitoring programs are to detect, to attribute, and to mitigate any changes in-water quality or quantity. Previous monitoring programs have had numerous problems including the failure to produce usable information and the failure to balance the competing factors of cost-effectiveness and environmental protection. A cost-effective, environmentally-responsive ground-water procedure was designed which consists of eight steps and two feedback loops. The reason for monitoring must first be determined before clear monitoring goals can be set. Characterization of the site allows proper design of the monitoring network. Data is then collected and analyzed creating usable information. Applying this new information to the information <b>expansion</b> <b>loop</b> permits {{a better understanding of the}} initial site characterization. Finally evaluating the entire routine to determine the effectiveness of the program allows the optimization loop to modify the system for greater efficiency. The value of this procedure was tested at selected sites in the Gibbons Creek Lignite Mine in Grimes County, Texas. The mine, which is currently in compliance with state regulations, is not operating an efficient monitoring program. The problems included over-monitoring of metals in and around reclaimed mine blocks, over-monitoring by monitoring wells in the same aquifer, and the failure to attribute changes in a monitoring well near a dewatering well. The feedback loops helped to optimize the entire program by recognizing problems in the stratigraphic column and modifying the monitoring program to lower monitoring costs. Three major benefits are gained by using this procedure: the ground-water monitoring routine can be made more cost-effective, environmental protection will be increased, and environmental liability will be decreased...|$|E
