40|$|The major {{purpose of}} the study was to find out the {{relationship}} between the level of attention and academic achievement. The tool designed to carry out this study was questionnaire. A sample of 420 students was taken from six secondary schools of district chakwal. The data was collected personally by visiting the concerned schools. The collected data was properly tabulated and analyzed with the help of ANOVA. The major findings of the study were: students’ level of attention directly effects their academic achievement. Those students who have high level of attention their academic achievement is also higher. As the level of attention decreases academic achievement also decreases student with moderate attention level have average academic achievement while the student with low level of attention are failed. The main <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>distract</b> <b>student</b> attention are noise, home environment, financial problems, health problems and lack of interest. The study concludes that attention should be considered an important psychological phenomenon that effects the students’ academic achievement. As the individuals are different in their capabilities, skills, intelligence and aptitude their level of attention is also different...|$|R

The 21 st {{century has}} presented many new technological advances <b>that</b> <b>distract</b> <b>students</b> {{and make the}} role of the teacher more complicated. It has become very difficult for the teacher to keep his or her students motivated and to keep them involved, especially during the literature session. Scholars in the field of education have introduced a lot of approaches that enhance students’ learning. One of these approaches is the discussion-based approach. This study seeks to ascertain whether or not students in one of the Lebanese schools comprehend literature texts better and are more involved in the literature classroom. Through examination of students’ responses to performance assessment questions, questionnaires from students, checklists filled by the participant observer, and rubrics from students, findings indicate that the discussion based approach motivates students, increases their involvement in the classroom, and improves their understanding. Since the method is action research, amendments for teaching using the discussion based approach have been made. 1 bound copy: x, 74 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R

Critical discourse analysis used in this research is a method that allows to detect such hidden meanings of societal agreements and interpretations encoded in texts. To exemplify how the roles of different parties are construed in traffic news, were analysed 26 police reports about {{traffic accidents}} that happened on crossroads in October and November 2013. To find out how such framing influences readers in interpreting the text, were questioned 104 respondents. The text analysis showed that traffic news stories are being framed through the driver’s viewpoint and attention is drawn to the pedestrian’s mistakes (lack of a reflector, dark clothing). Traffic reports are phrased {{in such a way that}} accidents happen, their active participants are cars which hit pedestrians and pedestrians who are hit by cars.

While some {{research}} demonstrates that laptops {{can be an}} important learning tool, anecdotal evidence suggests more and more faculty are banning laptops from their classrooms because of perceptions <b>that</b> they <b>distract</b> <b>students</b> and detract from learning. The current research examines the nature of in-class laptop use in a large lecture course and how that use is related to student learning. Students completed weekly surveys of attendance, laptop use, and aspects of the classroom environment. Results showed that students who used laptops in class spent considerable time multitasking and that the laptop use posed a signiWcant distraction to both users and fellow students. Most importantly, the level of laptop use was negatively related to several measures of student learning, including self-reported understanding of course material and overall course performance.

There are many <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>distract</b> learners from devoting themselves wholeheartedly to learning. This study takes a critical look at such factors, and the involvement of high school learners in the infonnal {{sector of the economy}} is identified as the focus for an in-depth interrogation. More specifically, {{the focus is on the}} reasons for learners' involvement in infonnal work, the type of work they do, as well as the impact of such involvement on their academic perfonnance. I have chosen to use the case study method in order to understand this phenomenon in one township high school, with a focus on Grade 11 learners as the study participants. Data was collected through a multi-method approach. This entailed a survey questionnaire, letters written by learners, and group and individual interviews. The life histories of learners were developed drawing from the data, and my own autobiography. Five learners, two boys and three girls, were selected to represent the voices of working learners through life histories. The findings of this study reveal that the kind of work activity engaged by learners is gendered, poorly paid, and makes them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, and that poverty, education needs, culture, family structure, and size are the main reasons for children's involvement in the economic activities of the infonnal sector. Noting the magnitude of the problem, the study concludes with some recommendations whilst conceding that there are no quick-fix solutions to challenges of this nature...|$|R

The main finding is that most <b>students</b> work in <b>distracting</b> surroundings and engage in many activities while studying. However, the more activities they engaged in, the worse their academic performance. The finding is consistent with research showing that using two (or more) cognitive processes simultaneously has a negative impact on both the effectiveness and the efficiency of carrying out tasks. Moreover, many students are not aware of the negative effects of distraction, or fool themselves that they can actually multitask because we also found <b>that</b> the most <b>distracted</b> <b>students</b> were the least good at predicting their own results. There was also a big difference between men who trusted to their personalities and luck for results and women, who took a more strategic approach and were more likely to achieve the results they predicted...|$|R

This paper discusses experiences and insights into recruitment of elderly Chinese participants for a restraint reduction clinical trial. Areas addressed include obtaining informed consent; factors affecting data collection; involvement of ward staff and relatives; and clinical research personal attributes. Insights suggest research personnel must appreciate and attend to cultural differences. Giving written consent is a serious matter for Chinese elderly; thorough and repeated explanation, plus family involvement is crucial to subject recruitment and retention. Researchers must recognize values, beliefs and perceptions, and external and internal <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> might <b>distract</b> elderly subjects during recruitment and data collection.

40|$|Whilst {{portable}} computers, such as laptops, notepads, personal assistants or smart phones, are now ubiquitous, {{their value}} as a tool in a learning environment is still an issue of considerable debate. This research studied the use of laptops as a learning tool in a traditional lecture for computer science students. A quantitative survey was conducted to analyse the readiness {{of the students and}} their perceptions of this form of mobile learning, as well as the effect of their demographics and readiness on the effectiveness of using laptops in lectures. The results show that students&# 039; readiness level was high as majority of the respondents owned laptops and were willing to take it to lectures. The students&# 039; perceptions of this form of learning were tested on six critical parameters derived from the literature, which include, increasing engagement, improving learning, encouraging collaboration, potential of distraction, ubiquity of laptops and using laptops for non-educational tasks. Overall, students felt that using laptops as a learning tool during lectures had positive benefits for increasing engagement, encouraging collaboration and improving learning potential, butt here was also the perception <b>that</b> laptops could <b>distract</b> <b>students</b> during lectures...|$|R

40|$|Teachers‘ code-switching in Indonesian EFL {{classroom}} {{has been}} a dilemma for years. Codeswitching itself means the shift from one language to another language within an utterance or utterances. In the context of Indonesian EFL classroom, code-switching happens when the teachers switch the language from the target language, English, to the first language, Indonesian. This phenomenon has been treated with several point views. Some believe <b>that</b> code-switching will <b>distract</b> <b>students</b> focus in learning English. Once the teachers switch the language into the first language, students will tend to be lenient to use English in the classroom. However, some also believe that the code-switching into the first language is needed when the teachers need to ensure whether the students understand the instructions or to solve problems happened in the classroom. Therefore, this paper aims {{to find out more}} on the phenomenon of code-switching in Indonesian EFL classroom, from the teachers‘ point of view and also the students‘ point view. The data for this paper is gathered from teachers and students of Introduction to College English (ICE) class of Duta Wacana Christian University.

40|$|The use {{of social}} network sites (SNS) such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Pinterest, Google Plus+, Tumblr, and Instagram, among others, has {{increased}} {{at a very}} fast pace {{in the last few}} years. In tandem with its rising popularity, especially among teenagers, many academics in higher education have been experimenting with its use in formal and less formal ways, in classroom teaching. Studies on the use of SNS in higher education indicate mixed results. While some academics found <b>that</b> SNS only <b>distracts</b> <b>students</b> from actual study and do not improve academic performance, others discovered that it improves communication and teacher-student relationships. Most however, agree that SNS’s popularity with students makes it a very useful tool to exploit for classroom teaching and management. There are very few studies which look into the effect of gender on the use of SNS in education. While studies have concluded that men and women approach and use SNS in slightly different ways, there is little in existing literature which tells us about how the use of SNS in higher education differs between men and women. This paper discusses research on the use of SNS in higher education by both genders. It details the results of a survey conducted in Malaysia and Australia and highlights how men and women perceive SNS use in higher education based on a framework built on Push Pull and Mooring theory...|$|R

40|$|Interactive navigable 3 D visualisations of {{built and}} natural environments have become commonplace {{in design and}} {{planning}} of urban environments and landscapes, and are regarded as potent prototyping and communication tools. In training applications, for instance for fire fighters, virtual environments displayed on desktop monitors or on projection screens are used to represent situations and scenarios that cannot be created {{in the real world}} for reasons of safety, cost, and time. A valid simulated environment should induce not only a cognitive, but also an emotional response in the observer equivalent to the response to the real environment. For visualisations, this means that viewers experience the ‘ambience’ of a place as they would in the real environment. In training environments and serious games, the emotional response of the trainee to the virtual scenario should be similar to the response in a real, often stressful, situation. A common assumption is that the highest possible level of photorealism ensures a valid representation. However, the focus in the development of virtual environments is on spatial tasks or other cognitive tasks, not on the affective qualities of an environment. The virtual environments do not contain the required information for that purpose, which can be visual, but also of other sensory modalities (audio, tactile and olfactory). In eight empirical studies (lab experiments and field studies) we examined factors in the content and representation of the virtual environment, and factors related to user characteristics, and their effects on the emotional response of users. We found that when users appraise a virtual environment they do not distinguish between their appraisals of the represented environment, of the representation, and of their pre-existing individual mental representations. The mental representation fills in more information than the user is aware of. The user’s emotional state, induced by other factors than the virtual environment, such as cybersickness, may influence the appraisal of the virtual environment. The absence of personal involvement, <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> diminish the perceived (graphics and audio) quality of the 3 D environment, and <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>distract</b> the attention of the user, attenuate the impact of cues and thereby the intensity of the emotional response. The importance of personal involvement and the context of use of a visualisation or a virtual training for their validity are generally underestimated. We discern three categories of features of real environments, relating to spatial layout and functionality, to the meaning and function of elements of the environment, and ambient conditions, {{that can be used to}} guide the modeling process. We developed a comprehensive framework containing factors (such as features of the environment, representational modifiers and response moderators) that influence and modify the appraisal process in virtual environments, that can be used for measuring emotional responses in virtual environments. We complete our research with guidelines for the development and use of desktop virtual environments for visualisations and training application...|$|R

Participation in student organizations can lead to the development of social and leadership skills, higher retention rates, heightened self-confidence, improved satisfaction with college, the ability to see course curriculum as more relevant, and further success after college. Despite the long list of benefits, there is an assumption <b>that</b> <b>student</b> organizations <b>distract</b> <b>students</b> from educational activities, thus resulting in lower academic performance. This study examined the grade point average (GPA) of undergraduate students enrolled at Purdue University during the fall 2009 semester to determine if there is a relationship between student involvement and GPA. The students were divided into one of three groups: general students, student organization members, and student organization officers. An average GPA was calculated for each group and used in a two-sample t-test for significance. The results indicate a relationship between involvement and GPA with student organization officers earning a significantly higher GPA then regular members of the organizations, and student organization members earning a significantly higher GPA than the general student population. Additionally, the study attempted to determine an optimal amount of involvement by testing the correlation between the number of organizations in which a student holds membership and term GPA. The results showed a very weak negative correlation.

In this study, the speech prosody of Mandarin L 1 speakers, English L 2 speakers, and English L 1 speakers was assessed by trained raters who listened to sound clips of the speakers responding to a graph prompt and reading a short passage. In order to eliminate other <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> might <b>distract</b> from assessing only the prosodic `goodness 2 ̆ 7 of a given speaker, the sound clips were acoustically filtered to attenuate all frequencies 500 Hz and above. This cut-off was used with the aim of preserving prosodic characteristics without including interference from segmental features where possible. The raters who participated in this study were trained to use the OEPT (Oral English Proficiency Test) scale to rate holistic speech in an unfiltered condition so this study employs an adapted version of that scale. The levels of the adapted scale were as follows: (1) – L 1 Mandarin Prosody, (3) L 2 Novice English Prosody, (5) L 2 Intermediate English Prosody, (7) Advanced English Prosody, (9) L 1 English Prosody. For each sound clip, the raters were asked to assign one of these proficiency levels and describe in qualitative terms why they choose that score. EFL students from different universities in China were also asked to complete this task of rating filtered speech along the same scale. The resulting analysis will examine the usefulness of rating prosody through filtered speech for L 2 prosody assessment as well as its potential benefits for prosody pedagogical development. ...|$|R
