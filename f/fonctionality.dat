40|$|Embedded systems {{surround}} us {{and assist}} {{us in our}} daily lives. They are ubiquitous and dedicated to a precise task, and can be distinguished at application level as well as performance level. They are usually intended for wireless communication and have complex design, as we often have to juggle very strict constraints in terms of integration and <b>fonctionality</b> (surface, power consumption, throughput, etc.). This book covers several aspects of embedded systems. In particular, it describes some interesting state-of-the-art technologies that address the problems of communications in this domain...|$|E
40|$|SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) {{networks}} control {{much of the}} industrialised nations {{production and}} supply complexes. Various government reports and investigations have highlighted the vulnerability of these systems. Many of these systems are on private networks which are increasingly being connected to systems that are accessible from other networks such as the Internet. There are a range of open source tools that now offer <b>fonctionality</b> {{that can be used}} to secure SCADA networks from intrusion or compromise. This paper explores some of the issues with current SCADA deployment trends from a network security perspective and then examines open source countermeasures that could be used to help mitigate some of these risks...|$|E
40|$|To {{promote and}} {{facilitate}} access to botany for protecting biodiversity indirectly is {{the objective of}} Flora Bellissima. This sofware package {{is based on an}} integrated and complete database with numerous <b>fonctionalities,</b> as well as on an expert system of recognition of plants called “Ophélie”. Aimed at beginners, amateurs and experts, Flora Bellissima attempts to show {{that it is possible to}} reconcile scientific rigor and popularization, in order to bring together everyone interested in botany...|$|R

The paper reports the preliminary results of this experience Microkernels provide a great modularity and flexibility for the conception of an operating system with the server architecture. Execution of lightweight activities, efficient communication and distributed shared virtual memory are very useful <b>fonctionalities</b> for managing the distributio...|$|R
40|$|In case of {{more complex}} systems quite a typical {{situation}} {{is that there is}} a number of autonomic services (managers) which are responsible for providing of some specific functionalities. If the services are delivered by various vendors a situation when some of the functionalities (features) will be provided by more than one of them is very likely. Some of the <b>fonctionalities</b> may be in conflict and the only way to prevent the conflicts is to equip the services (managers) with the capability of limiting their behaviour only to these areas which are confict free. In this paper an application of Agile policies to the problem of features interaction will be presented. It will be shown that Agile policies have some structural featues which make them ideal for features interaction prevention without any complex system-wide solution...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a distributed object based multilevel architecture to allow interoperability among heterogeneous {{geographical information systems}} (GIS). It consists of a lower level which provides interconnectivity among information sites and a higher level which provides <b>fonctionalities</b> to hide the heterogeneity among GIS. 1 Introduction Geographical information systems manage georeferenced data. They are characterized by a large volume of data, by modeling of complex spatial relationship, and by the diversity of existing models. Interoperability of GIS {{is the ability to}} access spatial data and associated services in a distributed and heterogeneous processing environment. Interoperability is necessary for the following reasons: 1) data are costly, 2) applications are no longer built from scratch but are constructed from existing components and 3) GIS applications may require specifics functionalities that are not supported by all systems. Interoperability among traditional inform [...] ...|$|R
