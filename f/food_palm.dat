"Once I had got {{outside the}} zone {{surrounding}} Ibanj, where the villages [...] are not taxed in rubber, I found the capitas, {{with very few}} [...] exceptions, were all armed with cap-guns. I met them frequently, [...] escorting the rubber caravans to the company post, or going from [...] village to village collecting the rubber from the centres under their [...] charge and distributing the trade goods for the coming month. I [...] noticed that they invariably carried their guns, and, in fact, I have [...] seldom seen a capita stir outside his own home without his gun. These [...] are the men who are appointed by the Kasai Company agents to enforce [...] the rubber tax. Chosen always from a different race, they have no [...] sympathy with the natives placed under them, and having the authority [...] of the agent behind them they can do as they please, {{so long as they}} [...] insure the rubber being brought at the proper times and in sufficient [...] quantities. In the villages they are absolute masters, and the [...] villagers have to supply them gratis with a house, <b>food,</b> <b>palm</b> wine, [...] and a woman. They exercise freely the right of beating or imprisoning [...] the villagers for any imaginary offences or for neglecting their work [...] in any way, and even go as far as imposing fines in cowries on their [...] own account, and confiscating for their own use the cowries paid over [...] by the plaintiff or defendant's family in the case of trial by poison, [...] which, in spite of statements to the contrary recently made in the [...] Belgian Chamber, are of frequent occurrence in this country. The [...] native cannot complain or obtain satisfaction in any way, as the [...] capita acts {{in the name of the}} company, and the company's agent is [...] always threatening them in the name of 'Bula-Matadi.' If the [...] authorities wish to act in the matter, they might profitably make [...] inquiry into the doings of the capitas at Bungueh, Bolong, and into [...] those of the Zappo Zap capita, who appears to exercise the chief [...] control over the villages near Ibunge, though he does not live in the [...] latter town. These appear to me to be among the worst where most are [...] bad. The capitas, however, are scarcely to be blamed, as, if they do [...] not extort enough rubber, they are liable in their turn to suffer at [...] the hands of the agent. Witness a case at Sangela, when it was [...] reported that the capita had some time back been chicotted in the [...] village itself by the agent for not bringing in rubber sufficient. [...] Endless cases could be quoted, but these will probably be sufficient [...] to show the methods pursued under the auspices of the Kasai Company.

50|$|It is {{not clearly}} {{understood}} how {{the disease was}} spread to East Africa as the planthopper Haplaxius crudus is not native in East Africa.The only explanation {{is that it was}} imported with grass seed from Florida that was used to create golf courses and lawns in beach resorts. There is a direct connection between green lawns and the spread of lethal yellowing in Florida. Even so-called 'resistant cultivars' such as the Malayan Dwarf or the Maypan hybrid between that dwarf and the Panama Tall were never claimed to have a 100% immunity. The nymphs of the planthoppers develop on roots of grasses, hence the areas of grass in the vicinity of palm trees is connected with the spread of this phytoplasma disease. The problem arose {{as a direct result of}} using coconut and date palms for ornamental and landscaping purposes in lawns, golf courses and gardens together with these grasses. When these two important <b>food</b> <b>palms</b> were grown in traditional ways (without grasses) in plantations and along the shores, the palm groves were not noticeably affected by lethal yellowing. There is no evidence that disease can be spread when instruments used to cut an infected palm are then used to cut or trim a healthy one. Seed transmission has never been demonstrated, although the phytoplasma can be found in coconut seednuts, but phytosanitary quarantine procedures that prevent movement of coconut seed, seedlings and mature palms out of an LY epidemic area should be applied to grasses and other plants that may be carrying infected vectors.|$|R
