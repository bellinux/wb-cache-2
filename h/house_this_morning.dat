60|$|On {{our way to}} the <b>house,</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> he {{consulted}} me, with some nervous impatience and irresolution, about a letter (forwarded to him from London) which he had received from Sergeant Cuff.|$|E
6000|$|... "They were there," [...] Quest declared, [...] "when I {{left the}} <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It seems probable," [...] he added, [...] "that {{the same person}} who is {{responsible}} for this double tragedy has also taken the jewels." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that," [...] he told her; [...] "only it {{is better}} for you to {{understand}} that if you turn me from your <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> I shall still feel the necessity of saving my brother from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{answer for}} that," [...] said the accountant; [...] "I found him {{over at the}} men's <b>houses</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> doing your work for you, doctor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Left the <b>house</b> early <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{without the}} {{slightest}} previous communication with me,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'And is gone, I know not where.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jimmy Skunk told me. He was up by Reddy's <b>house</b> early <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and saw Reddy try to walk. He {{tried and}} tried and couldn't. You won't {{have to watch}} out for Reddy Fox for some time, Peter. Serves him right, doesn't it?'' ...|$|R
60|$|If Henrietta {{had been}} free from blame {{in coming to}} Knight Sutton at all, or in her way of leaving the <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{there would have been}} little or no {{drawback}} to our pleasure in contemplating her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am annoyed {{and out of}} sorts, sir--that's the truth," [...] he said. [...] "Something {{unpleasant}} {{has happened}} in the <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> A man in my way of business has a deal to upset his temper, Sergeant Cuff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in!--Nay, falter not;" [...] (throwing a shawl over her) [...] "come in. Stand {{there and}} tell me if thou darest, that my son was in this <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and met me on the stairs. Darest thou say that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Asher has intimated to me {{that she}} does not expect to go back to her uncle's <b>house,</b> and <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> she made a {{reference}} to the end of her visit here, but I thought {{you might be able to}} tell me something about her uncle. If he really does not expect her back I want her to stay here." ...|$|R
40|$|A 25 -year-old man {{was arrested}} after gardaí found € 75, 000 worth of {{prescription}} drugs during a planned search of a <b>house</b> in Dublin <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> A property in Summerhill was raided at about 8. 30 am {{as part of a}} planned operation targeting the sale and supply of controlled drugs in the north city centre...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{you will be}} disappointed," [...] he said. [...] "I {{received}} your report and I went to a certain official myself--saw him in his own <b>house</b> before breakfast <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I had reports of three other men occupying responsible positions in the city, Thomson, against whom there was really tangible and serious evidence. Our friend had the effrontery almost to laugh at me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Waddington," [...] he continued, [...] "I {{was around}} at Idlemay <b>House</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I {{went to see}} what had become of the flower-pot. I found the little room swept bare. One of the workmen told me that the things had been stolen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"ME!" [...] says I; [...] "why, man, I {{have been}} in bed all the morning. I am ill--I have taken physic--I have not left the <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning!</b> Where is that scoundrel Ambrose? But, stop! where are my clothes and wig?" [...] for I was {{standing}} before them in my chamber-gown and stockings, with my nightcap on.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have not}} come here to make sport. Let him explain, without interruption, why {{he was at the}} Custom <b>House</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and then we will decide how we can best bring Master Lillie to realise that he must keep the {{agreement}} made with the other shopkeepers. What has Lieutenant Draper and his account to do with your visit, Hardy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This,' said Mr. Losberne, {{speaking}} softly, {{but with}} great vehemence notwithstanding, 'this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d' ye-call-him's grounds, {{at the back}} here, comes to the <b>house</b> for assistance <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand: who has placed his life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{went out}} from <b>this</b> <b>house</b> {{yesterday}} <b>morning,</b> {{and has not}} returned. Pierre and I were searching for him when we came across you. I then might have made trouble for all of us, but for little Frenchie, who was quick-witted enough {{to see that you}} feared lest we might speak to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, friends," [...] I said. [...] "A tale {{has been}} brought to me that I am {{not to be taken}} to the big camp to have my case inquired of by the council, but am to be shot down in cold blood when I come out of <b>this</b> <b>house</b> to-morrow <b>morning.</b> Is that true?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My husband," [...] she said, [...] "has justly {{surmised that}} I {{have not come}} here in any spirit of friendliness, I have come to let Mr. Wingate know the {{contents}} of this cable, which arrived soon after my husband left the <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> The message was in code, but, as Mr. Wingate's name appeared, I have taken the trouble to transcribe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{result of}} this course of {{proceeding}} will be (as Bashwood thinks) to put Mr. Darch {{in the position of}} the person who really decides on my claim to the widow's place and the widow's money. The income being charged on the estate, it must come out of Miss Blanchard's pocket; and the question of paying it would appear, therefore, to be a question for Miss Blanchard's lawyer. To-morrow will probably decide whether this view is the right one, for my letter to Armadale's representatives will have been delivered at the great <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I {{should raise}} your spirits," [...] Rothsay proceeded. [...] "When I came to your <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> the valet {{opened the door}} to me. I {{expressed}} my surprise at his condescending to take that trouble. He informed me that Joseph was otherwise engaged. 'With anybody in particular?' I asked, humoring the joke. 'Yes, sir, with the housekeeper. She's teaching him how to brush his hair, so as to show off his good looks to the best advantage.' Make up your mind, my friend, to lose Mrs. Mozeen--especially if she happens to have any money." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{was early}} in the evening yesterday--twenty-four hours ago. Since then not a soul has been near the <b>house.</b> Early <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I saw Father Adrian coming along the road from Vaux. I ran upstairs, and locked myself in my room, after forbidding the {{servants}} to let him enter. From the windows I watched him. To my surprise he never even glanced in. He walked past the gates, and took the road to the monastery. I saw him slowly ascend the hill and vanish out of sight in the darkening twilight. Once, just before he reached the summit, he paused and looked steadily down here. I could not see his face, but I saw him raise his right hand for a moment toward the sky. Then he turned round and pursued his way.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have to announce, Miss Garland," [...] said he, [...] "the {{enforced}} {{suspension of}} our journey. The driver {{asserts that the}} risk in travelling the mountain road by night is too great even to consider. It {{will be necessary to}} remain in the shelter of <b>this</b> <b>house</b> until <b>morning.</b> I beg that you will feel that there is nothing to fear beyond a temporary inconvenience. I have personally inspected the house, and find that there are means to provide against the rigour of the weather, at least. You shall be made as comfortable as possible. Permit me to assist you to alight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Clayton, tell me {{all about}} the fare who came and watched <b>this</b> <b>house</b> at ten o'clock <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and {{afterwards}} followed the two gentlemen down Regent Street." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{so happy}} all this summer, Anne--happier than I ever was in my life. I thought it was because {{everything}} had been made clear between you and me, {{and that it was}} our friendship which made life seem so beautiful and full once more. And it WAS, in part--but not all--oh, not nearly all. I know now why everything was so different. And now it's all over--and he has gone. How can I live, Anne? When I turned back into the <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> after he had gone the solitude struck me like a blow in the face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Necessity, and not vanity, {{has brought}} them out to-day. I broke the only teapot of yours {{there was in}} the <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and was in hopes Frank would have brought up one from the store to supply its place, before it would be wanted; {{but he does not}} come. As for spoons, I can find none {{belonging}} to the house, and we use these constantly. As the teapot was indispensable, I thought I might as well display all my wealth at once. But {{this is the first time}} the things have been used in many, many years!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess it}} ain't very {{convenient}} {{for me to}} go to 'Frisco just now. I went to see the governor yesterday afternoon, but I couldn't get to him. I saw the secretary, and he told me I'd got to take that boat and that was all there was to it. I just had to see the governor, so I waited outside his <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and when he come out I spoke to him. He didn't want to speak to me, I'll say, but I wouldn't let him shake me off, and at last he said he hadn't no objection to my staying here till the next boat to Sydney if the Rev. Davidson will stand for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what about}} the Englishman? The {{sectional}} Committee sent down some spies <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{to be on the}} look-out for him on or about <b>this</b> <b>house.</b> Have you got him?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Whom did {{you meet}} <b>this</b> <b>morning?</b> (informal: Who {{did you meet}} <b>this</b> <b>morning?)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Woke up <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> with my mind {{stayed on}} freedomI said I woke up <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> with my mind stayed on freedomWell I woke up <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> with my mind stayed on freedomHallelu, hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelu, hallelujah ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Prendergast {{remained}} {{there for some}} half-hour longer, explaining {{what ought to be}} done, and how it ought to be done. Of course he combated that idea of Owen's, that the property might be allowed to remain {{in the hands of the}} wrong heir. Had that been consonant with his ideas of justice he would not have made his visit to Hap <b>House</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Right must have its way, and if it should be that Lady Fitzgerald's marriage with Sir Thomas had not been legal, Owen, on Sir Thomas's death, must become Sir Owen, and Herbert could not become Sir Herbert. So much to the mind of Mr. Prendergast was as clear as crystal. Let justice be done, even though these Castle Richmond heavens should fall in ruins.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Beckendorff," [...] said he, {{in a calm}} voice, [...] "considering the {{circumstances}} under which you have found me in your <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> I should have known how to excuse and to forget any irritable expressions which a moment of ungovernable passion might have inspired. I should have passed them over unnoticed. But your unjustifiable behaviour has exceeded that line of demarcation which sympathy with human feelings allows even men of honour to recognise. You have disgraced both me and yourself by giving me a blow. It is, as that lady well styled it, an outrage; an outrage which the blood of any other man but yourself could only obliterate from my memory; but while I am inclined to be indulgent to your exalted station and your peculiar character, I at the same time expect, and now wait for, an apology!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR ZACK--The {{enclosed}} are {{the tickets}} for my picture show, which I {{told you about}} yesterday evening. I send them now, instead of waiting to give them to you to-night, at Lavvie's suggestion. She thinks only three days' notice, from now to Saturday, rather short, and considers it advisable to save even a few hours, so as to enable you to give your friends the most time possible to make their arrangements for coming to my studio. Post all the invitation tickets, therefore, that you send about among your connection, at once, as I am posting mine; and you will save a day by that means, {{which is a good}} deal. Patty is obliged to pass your <b>house</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> on an errand, so I send my letter by her. How conveniently things sometimes turn out, don't they? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you want}} at my door, Messer Greco? I saw you <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> at Nello's; if you had asked me then, I could have told you that I see no man in <b>this</b> <b>house</b> without knowing his {{business}} and agreeing with him beforehand." ...|$|R
40|$|Dr. Carl Schaffle, {{representative}} of the State Board of Health, arrived in Pittsburgh yesterday to help fight the disease in the industrial towns of the county; he had been sent previously {{by the state to}} Massachusetts to study the disease there; he met with Davis, Koenig, and Marks yesterday to review Pittsburgh’s preparations, of which he subsequently approved• Kingsley <b>House</b> opened <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and will be able to house 130 patients; a building on Washington Park playgrounds will soon be ready with 200 more beds, and the possibility of an additional 300 to be housed in a canvas hospital on its grounds; Edwards A.
