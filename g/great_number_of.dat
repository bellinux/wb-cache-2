5|$|After his death, Gaudí's works {{suffered}} {{a period of}} neglect and were largely unpopular among international critics, who regarded them as baroque and excessively imaginative. In his homeland he was equally disdained by Noucentisme, the new movement which took the place of Modernisme. In 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, Gaudí's workshop in the Sagrada Família was ransacked, and a <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> his documents, plans and scale models were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered to be much too narrow, and the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of artillery, light or heavy, to come through.

5|$|The Circus Starring Britney Spears {{generated}} {{positive to}} mixed reception from critics. While some praised its aesthetics and deemed {{it as an}} entertaining show, others criticized Spears' lack of involvement during some segments. The tour was a commercial success, with a total gross of $131.8million. This made The Circus Starring Britney Spears one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade. A <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> tickets were sold {{within a week of}} the tour's announcement, which prompted supporters to add more dates. The tour also broke attendance records in many cities and all the North American shows were sold out. It became the fifth highest grossing tour of 2009, and the sixth highest grossing tour ever by a female artist. The show generated controversy on the Australian leg after a reporter said that a <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fans had walked out during the performances.|$|E

An explanation {{for this is that}} the Incremental+ strategy imposes restrictions to the algorithms and this reduces the search space, decreasing, as a consequence, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> possible solutions. GA for the system AJHotDraw is the single exception where the Incremental+ strategy found a <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> solutions.

5|$|After the Fatimid caliphs {{moved to}} Egypt, el-Mansuriya {{remained}} {{the capital of}} the Zirids, who became the local rulers, for the next eighty-five years. The Zirid ruler el-Mansur bin Buluqqin built a palace for himself at el-Mansuriya. There is a record of the lavish marriage in 1022-23 of his grandson, the young Zirid el-Muizz bin Badis. Pavilions were built outside the city, a large array of textiles and manufactured good was displayed and music was provided by a <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> instruments. El-Muizz bin Badis, who ruled Ifriqiya under the Fatimids from 1015 to 1062, rebuilt the Kairouan city wall and built two walls {{on either side of the}} road from Kairouan to el-Mansuriya. He ordered the transfer to el-Mansuriya of the crafts and commerce from Kairouan.|$|E

Native states, notably Msiri's Yeke Kingdom, the Zande Federation, and Swahili-speaking territory in the eastern Congo under Tippu Tip, refused to recognise colonial authority and were defeated by the Force Publique with great brutality, during the Congo Arab war. In 1895, a military mutiny broke out among the Batetela in Kasai, leading to a 4-year insurgency. The conflict was particularly brutal and caused a <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> casualties.|$|E

5|$|Each {{year on the}} Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, a <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> devotees come to the monastery, {{popularly known}} as Shingjon among Albanians. In the morning, the reliquary is placed {{at the center of}} the church under a canopy, before being opened. After the morning liturgy has been celebrated, {{chanting}} priests carry the reliquary three times around the church, followed by the devotees, who hold lit candles. The reliquary is then placed in front of the church, to be kissed by the believers. The priests give them pieces of cotton that have been kept inside the reliquary since the previous feast. There are numerous stories about people, both Christians and Muslims, who were healed after they prayed before the saint's relics.|$|E

Edmund was born at Woodstock in Oxfordshire on 5 August 1301, and was therefore referred to as Edmund of Woodstock. Son of the English king, he was also, through his mother, grandson of Philip III of France. On 7 July 1307, before Edmund had turned six, King Edward I died, leaving Edmund's half-brother Edward to succeed as King Edward II.|$|E
