Their analysis highlights weaknesses in product design, implementation challenges, and operational problems. The authors'finding is that the crop <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> in its current form does not achieve its objectives, either explicit (risk management) or implicit (safety net and containment of both the central and state governments'contingent liability). The crop <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> performs poorly both in terms of coverage (number of hectares insured and number of farmers purchasing insurance) and financial performance. The authors provide a framework for designing a crop <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> {{based on the premise that}} insurance is a cost effective risk management techniques. They also provide some new ideas and thinking toward both improving the existing crop <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> and exploring alternatives to the current product, based on an area-yield approach. ...|$|R

One hundred and eighty farmers who had adopted crop <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> were selected through random sampling procedure. The respondents were interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire for identifying factors influencing and constraints in adoption of crop <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> The study revealed that lack of scope for crop diversification and definite crop loss due to adverse climatic condition were the major factors influencing the adoption of crop <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> The study inferred that lack of compensation from the crop <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme,</b> delayed payment of indemnity, lack of awareness about the scheme and lengthy procedure to avail crop insurance were the major constraints...|$|R
40|$|Farmers face {{increasing}} income {{uncertainty and}} the debate is growing {{on the role of}} <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> and of public support in this field. This paper applies a PMP modelling approach that takes into explicit consideration risk aversion behaviour to test its applicability to evaluating the potential impact of <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> This is done by introducing a revenue <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> into a model developed on a small group of crop farms in Italy. The paper represents a preliminary assessment of the soundness of the proposed approach. It identifies some limitations that should be overcome to improve the proposed approach. Despite these limitations, it seems a useful tool to investigate the impact of <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> and policy relevant parameters such as premium and coverage rates. Indeed, it permits the assessment of how this affects production choices, farm profitability and the impact of public support to reduce the net premium paid by farmers. <b>Insurance</b> <b>schemes,</b> PMP, Farmers’ behaviour, Risk aversion, Agricultural and Food Policy, Q 12, C 61, Q 18,...|$|R

50|$|In {{the antebellum}} {{period and the}} 1920s, there were various deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> Those based on {{self-regulation}} via mutual liability were successful; compulsory state-based <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> were not. A look at Texas in the years 1919-26 shows that the deposit insurance for state-chartered banks increased the likelihood of bank failure during the period.

40|$|The public social <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> {{are very}} {{important}} for people’s security and are in the focus of debate on loss of income {{in the event of}} unemployment, illness, occupational injury, old age and parental leave. Regardless of whether discussions concern the incentive to work or the effects of insurances on income distribution, they are usually about the public <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> However, there is not just social insurance. There are also supplementary <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes,</b> which affect both incentives and income distribution. The benefits decided upon in agreements between the social partners are the most important, but are not the only ones. These supplementary <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> have previously not attracted much attention and many citizens have scant knowledge about the overall extent and content of the agreements, {{despite the fact that the}} benefits linked to the collective agreements cover the great majority of wage-earners. In this report to the Expert Group on Economic Studies (ESS), PhD Gabriella Sjögren Lindquist and Professor Eskil Wadensjö, both active at the Swedish Institute for Social Research at Stock-holm University, provide a general picture of how the agreement-based benefits, other supplementary benefits and social <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> relate to and interact with one another. They underline the necessity of a holistic view of the social security schemes developed by the state and the social partners. It is thus not reasonable to disregard the agreement-based <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes,</b> if one wishes to know about, and research into, the effects that social security <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> have on the economy. It is the total benefit and not only benefit from the public social <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> that affects the incentives of individuals to make different decisions.

40|$|Deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> were an {{important}} element in policy responses to the global financial crisis (GFC). There has been considerable debate about the nature and efficacy of such policy measures in alleviating the fallout from financial crises. The GFC highlighted problems associated with deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> including moral hazard, coverage limits, co-insurance, cross border issues and market distortions. Despite these shortcomings, deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> were able to ameliorate the financial panic experienced and reduce contagion. This paper evaluates the Australian and New Zealand experience with deposit insurance introduced in response to the GFC, and compares this to the OECD experience. It reflects on the performance of deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> considered against the attributes of good policy design, and evaluates the specific problems and strengths encountered during the GFC...|$|R
