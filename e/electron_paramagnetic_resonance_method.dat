Furthermore, divalent transition metal ions, especially Zn 2 + and Cu 2 +, seem to directly affect the MBP-mediated formation and stabilization of the myelin sheath of the central nervous system. MBP belongs to the realm of intrinsically disordered proteins, and only fragmentary information is available regarding its partial structure(s) or supramolecular arrangements.

In the presence of phosphates, further addition of divalent metal ions above a characteristic threshold of four Cu 2 + atoms or two Zn 2 + atoms per MBP molecule leads to the formation of large MBP aggregates within the protein solution.

The inhibition of fast microsecond motions was not accompanied by tension loss, implying that these motions are not necessary for force generation. At diameters below the equilibrium spacing, both the disorder and the mobility decreased dramatically in parallel with the tension inhibition, suggesting that slower microsecond motions and the disorder of the myosin head are necessary for muscle function...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that the electrical breakdown properties of polymer composites can be substantially enhanced when the filler particles are of nanometric dimensions. These benefits are likely related to the mitigation and redistribution of internal charge. Using the example of an epoxy-TiO 2 ̆ 082 nanodielectric (and a comparable conventional composite), this contribution seeks to examine this issue from the physical and chemical viewpoint. It is shown that a reduction in free volume cannot be used to explain the dielectric enhancements. The free volume of nanomaterials is actually {{higher than that of}} conventional samples. This conclusion is consistent with recent application of <b>electron</b> <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>methods,</b> which have confirmed earlier speculation that the environment associated with the interface is radically changed when the in-filled particulates are reduced to nanometric dimensions and the associated interfacial area is greatly increased. Through examinations of infrared absorption & EPR, the paper provides some speculation on the part played by an interaction zone surrounding the particulate inclusions.

Here we test the potential of distance determination between paramagnetic spin-labels by a pulsed <b>electron</b> <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>method.</b> We use double electron–electron spin resonance (DEER) to study the denaturant-dependent equilibrium folding of flavodoxin. This flavoprotein is spin-labeled with MTSL ((1 -oxy-, 2, 2, 5, 5 -tetramethyl-d-pyrroline- 3 -methyl) -methanethiosulfonate) at positions 69 and 131. We find that nativelike spin-label separation dominates the distance distributions up to 0. 8 M guanidine hydrochloride. At 2. 3 M denaturant, the distance distributions show an additional component, which we attribute to a folding intermediate. Upon further increase of denaturant concentration, the protein expands and evidence for a larger number of conformations than in the native state is found. We thus demonstrate that DEER is a versatile technique to expand the arsenal of methods for investigating how proteins fold...|$|E

However, segmental motions of the cross-linked skeletal proteins remained generally {{similar to those in}} normal skeletal proteins. Both the weakly immobilized and the strongly immobilized motions were similar in cross-linked and control samples. Small differences in some motional components were detected. In some cases, faster mobilities were observed, with approximately 5 % of the strongly immobilized motions converted to the weakly immobilized motions in the cross-linked samples. It is often believed that the consequence of membrane protein oxidation is restricted protein dynamics, giving membrane rigidity. However, our studies provide needed experimental evidence to indicate that segmental motions are maintained with very little modification even in the presence of extensive cross-linking.

APSR was isolated and purified directly from massive anaerobically grown Desulfovibrio gigas, a strict anaerobe, for structure and function investigation. Oligomerization of APSR to form dimers–α_ 2 β_ 2, tetramers–α_ 4 β_ 4, hexamers–α_ 6 β_ 6, and larger oligomers was observed during purification of the protein. Dynamic light scattering and ultracentrifugation revealed that the addition of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or adenosine 5 ′-phosphosulfate (APS) disrupts the oligomerization, indicating that AMP or APS binding to the APSR dissociates the inactive hexamers into functional dimers. Treatment of APSR with β-mercaptoethanol decreased the enzyme size from a hexamer to a dimer, probably by disrupting the disulfide Cys 156 —Cys 162 toward the C-terminus of the β-subunit. Alignment of the APSR sequences from D. gigas and A. fulgidus revealed the largest differences in this region of the β-subunit, with the D. gigas APSR containing 16 additional amino acids with the Cys 156 —Cys 162 disulfide.

After incubation of OPP liposomes with MT- 3 cells, {{a reduction of}} liposome entrapped, water soluble spin-probe tempocholine (ASL) was observed, indicating that ASL is released from liposomes and is reduced by oxy-redoxy systems inside the cells. This process is fast if cholesterol content in the bilayer was 29 or 45  mol%, whereas at 56  mol% cholesterol the process is almost stopped. The rate of spin-probe reduction in first 10  min after incubation with cells is even faster as for the free ASL, indicating that liposomes with low amount of cholesterol accelerate penetration of ASL into the cells. A faster release of hydrophilic material from liposomes with low cholesterol content coincides {{with the presence of}} domains with highly disordered alkyl chain motion that disappears at 50  mol% of cholesterol. We propose that these highly fluid domains are responsible for interaction of OPP liposomes with cells and fast release of the entrapped material into the cells. These results suggest that micelles are not the only reason for cytotoxic effect of OPP liposom formulations, as it was suggested before. OPP in liposomes, containing 45  mol% cholesterol or less, also contributes to the cytotoxic effect, due to their fast interaction with breast-cancer cells...|$|E

There were 13 participants to whom samples were dispatched, and 11 laboratories reported results. The participants received five calibration samples (0, 0. 8, 2, 4, and 10 Gy) and four blindly irradiated samples (0, 0. 9, 1. 3, and 3. 3 Gy). Participants were divided into two groups: for group A (formed by three participants), samples came from a homogeneous batch of glass and were stored in similar setting; for group B (formed by eight participants), samples came from different smart phones and stored in different settings of light and temperature. The calibration curves determined by the participants of group A had a small error and a critical level in the 0. 37 - 0. 40 -Gy dose range, whereas the curves determined by the participants of group B were more scattered and led to a critical level in the 1. 3 - 3. 2 -Gy dose range for six participants out of eight. Group A were able to assess the dose within 20 % for the lowest doses (< 1. 5 Gy) and within 5 % for the highest doses. For group B, only the highest blind dose could be evaluated in a reliable way because of the high critical values involved. The results from group A are encouraging, whereas the results from group B suggest that the influence of environmental conditions and the intervariability of samples coming from different smart phones need to be further investigated.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} to {{evaluate}} the photochemical behavior of drugs and their associated photosensitizing potential by instrumental methods was successfully achieved. In this investigation, an HPLC method was developed, which {{makes it possible to}} determinate reactive oxygen species generated from photoirradiated drugs. This was achieved by using various surrogate parameters to detect and create kinetics for the reactive oxygen species. The formation of singlet oxygen under the influence of light was studied with the help of FFA and RNO to various drugs. In the process ketoprofen, furosemide and doxycycline showed the strongest 1 O 2 formation. Furthermore, it is possible to determine with this method whether the 1 O 2 is formed directly by the drug or by one of its photoproducts. The formation of superoxide was detected using NBT. The described method allows predicting the photosensitive/phototoxic potential of a drug through a type II reaction. In order to predict the photosensitizing potential of a drug through a type I reaction an <b>electron</b> <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>method</b> was developed. In the developed method, the drug was irradiated during simultaneous spectrum recordings. The result of the drug investigations showed, {{that it is possible to}} detect light-induced free radical formation over the time, thus, giving insights into the reactivity and durability of the radicals formed. Moreover, it is possible to determine the position at which the free radical is formed. Accord-ingly, it is possible to distinguish whether a drug reacts phototoxic via a type I or type II reac-tion. In addition to these results, the behavior of irritated drugs in presence of biomolecules has been studied. Calcitonin has been used as a model molecule. It was found that especially the drugs which also showed a pronounced formation of reactive oxygen species, lead to a degra-dation of calcitonin. Not all tested photosensitizers, such as doxycycline, showed a degrada-tion of calcitonin. By combining the photoreactor with an LC-ESI-TOF system, resulting photoproducts were determined. These photoproducts could partially be assigned to the photodegradation products described in the literature. The results promise a further development of the method using an MS-MS detector to have a lot of potential, since both, the detection limit is reduced, and it is also possible to identify the newly formed photoproducts. Therefore, it should be possible to create photo-reaction pathways. The main purpose of the developed method is the screening of the photosensitive and photo-toxic potential of drugs and other substances. Through the use of this screening method, it will be possible to predict the phototoxic or photoallergic potential of pharmaceutical substances in early stage of development.

SR experiments were performed at 27 degrees and 37 degrees C, and recovery signals were analyzed for initial conditions and multiexponential time constants by computer fitting using a damped least-squares approach. The time constants contain combinations of the electron spin lattice relaxation time, Tle, for each member of the spin-label pair, and the Heisenberg exchange rate constant, Kx. Spin-lattice relaxation times for each of the 14 N and 15 N stearic acid spin labels were determined, and it is noted that Tle for a given 15 N-SASL was always slightly greater than that of the corresponding 14 N-SASL. From Kx the bimolecular collision frequency was calculated, providing a detailed picture of molecular interactions. For both lipid systems the bimolecular collision rates were ordered as 12 : 5 less than 16 : 5 less than 5 : 5 less than 16 : 12 less than 12 : 12 less than 16 : 16. For all spin-label pairs studied, interaction frequencies were greater in DMPC than in DEPC.

The reliability of the choice to measure ROS production rate in human capillary blood rather than in plasma was tested (step I). A significant...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} risk of metal-centered oxidative catalysis {{has been overlooked}} in the research of the copper complexes of the Alzheimer's disease-related β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides. Cu 2 + complexes of Aβ 1 – 40 and its 1 – 16 and 1 – 20 fragments have recently been shown to exhibit significant metal-centered oxidative activities toward several catecholamine neurotransmitters with and without H 2 O 2 around neutral pH [G. F. Z. da Silva, L. -J. Ming, “Metallo-ROS” in Alzheimer's disease: metal-centered oxidation of neurotransmitters by CuII–β-amyloid and neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 46 (2007) 3337 – 3341]. The results further support the metallo-Aβ-associated oxidative stress theory often considered {{to be connected to}} the neuropathology of the disease. The metal-centered oxidative catalysis of CuAβ 1 – 16 / 20 challenges the long-standing proposed redox role of Met 35 in Aβ because Aβ 1 – 16 / 20 do not contain a Met. External Met has been determined by kinetic, optical, and <b>electron</b> <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>methods</b> to bind directly to the Cu 2 + center of CuAβ 1 – 40 and CuAβ 1 – 20 with Kd= 2. 8  mM and 11. 3  μM, respectively, which reflects less accessibility of the metal center in the full-length CuAβ 1 – 40. However, Met does not serve as a reducing agent for the Cu(II) which thus must amplify the observed oxidative catalysis of CuAβ 1 – 20 through a non-redox mechanism. Conversely, the CuAβ-catalyzed oxidation reaction of dopamine is inhibited by bio-available reducing agents such as ascorbate (competitive Kic= 66  μM) and glutathione (non-competitive, Kinc= 53  μM). These data indicate that the oxidation chemistry of metallo-Aβ is not initiated by Met 35. The results yield further molecular and mechanistic insights into the roles of metallo-Aβ in this disease...|$|R

Recent unpublished results from the pulsed EPR laboratory at UC-Davis are discussed, along with aspects of recent publications, with a focus on substrate and cofactor interactions. New data on the proximity of exchangeable deuterons around the Mn cluster poised in the S 0 -state are presented and interpreted. These pulsed EPR results are used in an evaluation of several recently proposed mechanisms for PSII water oxidation. We strongly favor mechanistic models where the substrate waters bind within the OEC early in the S-state cycle. Models in which the OO bond is formed by a nucleophilic attack by a Ca 2 +-bound water on a strong S 4 -state electrophile provide a good match to the pulsed EPR data...|$|R
