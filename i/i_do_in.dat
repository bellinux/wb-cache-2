He remarked, [...] "My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans." [...] He added [...] "It's {{the one thing that}} <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> my life that's almost an avocation.

In an interview, Willis said, [...] "I have a warm spot in my heart for Die Hard..... it's just the sheer novelty {{of being able to}} play the same character over 25 years and still be asked back is fun. It's much more challenging to have to do a film again and try to compete with myself, which is what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> Die Hard. I try to improve my work every time." ...|$|E

I feel about the airplane much the same as <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> regard to fire. That is, I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, but I think it is good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses." ...|$|E

The songs which I've always made often share the same views and ideas as the listener, but this time, they're more like shouts and prayers from my individual innermost self. With this image, I've probably gotten closer to how I was like inside when I first debuted.

500|$|Although Hoglan {{initially}} {{denied the}} definitive break-up of the band, {{saying they would}} go on tour in March 2007, he later stated Strapping Young Lad is on [...] "extended hiatus", and might never reunite again. In May 2007, during a press conference held to promote his new solo album, Ziltoid the Omniscient, Townsend announced his plans to retreat from public view, including giving interviews and touring, to concentrate on his family, and producing solo albums, {{as well as other}} people's music. As a result, Strapping Young Lad were effectively disbanded. Townsend discussed his future projects in a May 2007 Metal Hammer interview, where he stated [...] "there may be some stuff <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the future that is as brutal and heavy as Strapping, it's just not going to be Strapping".|$|E

500|$|Once the {{abolition}} of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: [...] "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> signing this paper." [...] For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors' Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.|$|E
500|$|Hartman {{provided}} the voices for numerous characters on the Fox animated series The Simpsons, appearing in 52 episodes. He {{made his first}} appearance in the second season episode [...] "Bart Gets Hit by a Car". Although he was originally brought in for a one-time appearance, Hartman enjoyed working on The Simpsons and the staff wrote additional parts for him. He voiced the recurring characters Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure, {{as well as several}} one-time and background characters. His favourite part was that of McClure, and he often used this voice to entertain the audience between takes while taping episodes of NewsRadio. He remarked, [...] "My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans." [...] He added [...] "It's the one thing that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> my life that's almost an avocation.

500|$|On July 11, 2008, Shinoda's second {{public art}} show [...] "Glorious Excess (BORN)" [...] premiered at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. The show {{included}} nine new pieces, with an exclusive signing on opening night. The show served as part {{one of the}} two-part [...] "Glorious Excess" [...] series, with the second installment [...] "Glorious Excess (DIES)" [...] due at JANM on August 22, 2009. Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the Glorious Excess series, stating, [...] "It Got {{to a point where}} the pervasiveness of 'celebrity news' concerned me. It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong. I would be watching the news, and thinking, 'of all the things {{going on in the world}} right now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't make sense to me. Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent." ...|$|E

500|$|The Berle shows drew {{such high}} ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 {{appearance}} on NBC's Steve Allen Show in New York. Allen, no fan {{of rock and}} roll, introduced a [...] "new Elvis" [...] in a white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang [...] "Hound Dog" [...] {{for less than a}} minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, [...] "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd... set things up so that Presley would show his contrition". Allen, for his part, later wrote that he found Presley's [...] "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" [...] and simply worked the singer into the customary [...] "comedy fabric" [...] of his program. Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, [...] "I'm holding down on this show. I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> a personal appearance." [...] Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career. Later that night, he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local TV show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, [...] "No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?" ...|$|E

'Neighbor, my garden hose cost me $15; you have to pay me $15 for it' …I don't want $15 — I want my garden hose back after the fire is over."

In an interview with BBC Radio 4 on 18 November 2007, Tutu accused the church of being obsessed with homosexuality and declared: [...] "If God, as they say, is homophobic, I wouldn't worship that God." [...] Tutu has said that in future anti-gay laws would be regarded as just as wrong as apartheid laws. Tutu has also supported the inclusion of same-sex marriages within the Anglican Church of Southern Africa.|$|E
2500|$|Welch {{posed for}} Playboy {{magazine}} in 1979, {{but she never}} did a full nudity photo shoot. Hugh Hefner and Gary Cole later wrote: [...] "Raquel Welch, {{one of the last}} of the classic sex symbols, came from the era when you could be considered the sexiest woman in the world without taking your clothes off. She declined to do complete nudity, and I yielded gracefully. The pictures prove her point." [...] Welch has refused to take all her clothes off on screen or pose naked throughout her career spanning five decades, saying it is the way she has been brought up. While her image in the 1960s was that of a torrid sex temptress, Raquel's private life was quite different. She once famously said: [...] "What I do on the screen is not to be equated with what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> my private life. Privately, I am understated and dislike any hoopla".|$|E
2500|$|On November 1, 2011 Jakob Dylan {{announced}} that the Wallflowers would be reuniting to release an album, explaining: [...] "I never suggested we were breaking up. [...] We all felt we were losing the plot a bit and we needed a break. [...] And that year break becomes two years, then becomes three years, {{and before you know}} it five or six years go by pretty quickly. [...] I can't do what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the Wallflowers without them. [...] I miss it." [...] In an interview with the St. Joseph News-Press, Dylan stated that the Wallflowers would be getting into the studio in January and the lineup would include Greg Richling on bass, Rami Jaffee on keys, Stuart Mathis on guitar and Fred Eltringham on drums. [...] However, weeks before the Wallflowers began recording, Eltringham left the band to pursue other projects. [...] The band quickly got former Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons to join the band. [...] Irons was previously involved in a side project with Wallflowers bassist Richling.|$|E

2500|$|Southey's {{contemporary}} James Losh {{believed that}} the poem was [...] "superior to anything before written by Southey". A letter from Charles Lamb to Southey dated 6 May 1815 said, [...] "I have, since the receipt of your present, read it quite through again, and with no diminished pleasure. I don't know whether I ought {{to say that it}} has given me more pleasure than any of your long poems. Kehama is doubtless more powerful, but I don't feel that firm footing in it that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> Roderick". An anonymous review in the December 1814 Theatrical Inquisitor argued, [...] "It is scarcely possible to view the errors of exalted genius without breathing a sigh of compassion and regret. The generous mind feels humiliated at the contemplation [...] Such are the feelings that must be excited by the reader of Southey's poems [...] The story of the present poem is interesting, and would probably have made an excellent romance. It has, however, several capital defects, that make it altogether unfit for an heroic poem".|$|E
2500|$|Inman {{played the}} camp Mr. Wilberforce Claybourne Humphries and his earlier {{career in the}} clothes retail {{business}} was good preparation for this role in a menswear department. Inman developed a characteristic limp-wristed mincing walk, and a high-pitched catchphrase, [...] "I'm free!", which soon entered popular culture. Inman reported that four or {{five members of the}} group Campaign for Homosexual Equality picketed one of his shows in protest as they believed his persona did not help their cause. Inman said that [...] "they thought I was over exaggerating the gay character. But I don't think <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> fact there are people far more camp than Mr. Humphries walking around this country. Anyway, I {{know for a fact that}} an enormous number of viewers like Mr. Humphries and don't really care whether he's camp or not. So far from doing harm to the homosexual image, I feel I might be doing some good". Both Inman and David Croft stated that the character was [...] "just a mother's boy", and that his sexual orientation was never explicitly stated. Inman continued to play in live shows after his success as Mr. Humphries, and began to incorporate camp mannerisms to those performances too, once saying [...] "Even when I'm not playing Mr Humphries, say at a summer season, I camp it up a bit. If I don't the audience are disappointed".|$|E
2500|$|Jackson's {{representative}} {{explained the}} incident, saying, [...] "Justin {{was supposed to}} pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed." [...] CBS forced Jackson to release a video apology, and said [...] "My decision to change the Super Bowl performance was made after the final rehearsal. MTV, CBS, [...] the NFL {{had no knowledge of}} this whatsoever and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end. I am really sorry if I offended anyone, that was truly not my intention". Jackson later commented, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident" [...] when the statement was replayed in the media. A written statement read, [...] "The decision to have a costume reveal {{at the end of my}} halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL." [...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, [...] "It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [...] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand." [...] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, [...] "Who knows...Maybe they'll get mad at something that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> my show, but at least it won't be new to me, since I've already gone through all of this. But I feel very positive that things are going to work out just fine. Everything happens for a reason." ...|$|E
