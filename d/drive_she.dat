500|$|The {{music video}} {{served as an}} {{inspiration}} for Morley while writing his book [...] In the book, Morley [...] "turned the lonely <b>drive</b> <b>she</b> [...] made in the song's video towards a city [...] into a fictional history of music," [...] referring to the opening sequence of the music video. The critic takes a ride with Minogue through a city and encounters various musicians and artists like the ghost of Elvis Presley, and Madonna, Kraftwerk, and [...] Wittgenstein. Academics Diane Railton and Paul Weston, in their 2005 essay Naughty Girls and Red Blooded Women (Representations of Female Heterosexuality in Music Video), contrasted the music video of [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] with that of American singer Beyoncé's 2003 single [...] "Baby Boy." [...] Railton and Weston concluded that while both videos focus on two singers performing seductive dance routines, Minogue is presented in a calculated manner and [...] "is always provisional, restricted, and contingent," [...] whereas Beyoncé displays a particular [...] "primitive, feral, uncontrolled and uncontrollable" [...] sexuality embodied by the black female body. The two felt that the videos were representative of the raced depictions of white and black women in colonial times and pop culture, respectively.|$|E
