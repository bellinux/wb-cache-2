50|$|Hyaluronic acid {{synthesis}} {{has been}} shown to be inhibited by 4-methylumbelliferone (<b>hymecromone,</b> heparvit), a 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin derivative.This selective inhibition (without inhibiting other glycosaminoglycans) may prove useful in preventing metastasis of malignant tumor cells. There is feedback inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis by low molecular weight hyaluronan (<500kDa) at high concentrations but stimulation by high molecular weight (>500kDa) HA when tested in cultured human synovial fibroblasts.|$|E
40|$|Purpose Current {{treatments}} for metastatic {{renal cell carcinoma}} do not extend survival beyond a few months. Sorafenib is a targeted drug approved for metastatic renal cell carcinoma but it has modest efficacy. <b>Hymecromone</b> is a nontoxic dietary supplement with some antitumor activity at high doses of 450 to 3, 000 mg per day. <b>Hymecromone</b> inhibits the synthesis of hyaluronic acid, which promotes tumor growth and metastasis. We recently noted that the hyaluronic acid receptors CD 44 and RHAMM are potential predictors of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. In the current study we examined the antitumor properties of <b>hymecromone,</b> sorafenib and the combination in renal cell carcinoma models. Materials and Methods Using proliferation, clonogenic and apoptosis assays, we {{examined the effects of}} <b>hymecromone</b> (0 to 32 μg/ml), sorafenib (0 to 3. 2 μg/ml) and <b>hymecromone</b> plus sorafenib in Caki- 1, 786 -O, ACHN and A 498 renal cell carcinoma cells, and HMVEC-L and HUVEC endothelial cells. A Boyden chamber was used for motility and invasion assays. Apoptosis indicators, hyaluronic acid receptors, epidermal growth factor receptor and c-Met were evaluated by immunoblot. The efficacy of <b>hymecromone,</b> sorafenib and <b>hymecromone</b> plus sorafenib was assessed in the sorafenib resistant Caki- 1 xenograft model. Results <b>Hymecromone</b> plus sorafenib synergistically inhibited proliferation (greater than 95...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of lipolysis on the release of poorly water-soluble drug from SMEDDS in the perspective of drug core/shell location. For this purpose, four SMEDDS formulations with various core/shell properties were developed based on long-chain lipid or medium-chain lipid as well as different surfactant/oil ratios. Poorly water-soluble drugs, <b>hymecromone</b> and resveratrol, were significantly solubilized in all SMEDDS formulations and the diluted microemulsions. Fluorescence spectra analysis indicated that <b>hymecromone</b> was mainly located in the shell of microemulsions, while resveratrol was located in the core. The effect of lipolysis on the release rates of drugs with different core/shell locations were investigated by a modified in vitro drug release model. For the drug located in the shell, <b>hymecromone,</b> the release profiles were not affected during the lipolysis process and no significant differences were observed among four formulations. For the drug located in the core, resveratrol, the release rates were increased to various degrees depending on the extent of digestion. In conclusion, the drug core/shell location plays an important role for determining the effect of lipolysis on drug release from SMEDDS formulation...|$|E
40|$|Hyaluronan (HA) is a {{prominent}} {{component of the}} extracellular matrix (ECM) at many sites of chronic inflammation, including type 1 diabetes (T 1 D), multiple sclerosis (MS), and numerous malignancies. Recent publications have demonstrated that when HA synthesis is inhibited using 4 -methylumbelliferone (4 -MU) beneficial effects are observed in several animal models of these diseases. Notably, 4 -MU is an already approved drug in Europe and Asia called <b>hymecromone</b> where {{it is used to}} treat biliary spasm. However, there is uncertainty regarding how 4 -MU treatment provides benefit in these animal models and the potential long-term consequences of HA inhibition. Here, we review what is known about how HA contributes to immune dysregulation and tumor progression. Then, we review what is known about 4 -MU and <b>hymecromone</b> in terms of mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and safety. Finally, we review recent studies detailing the use of 4 -MU to treat animal models of cancer and autoimmunity...|$|E
40|$|Mucus layer, a {{selective}} diffusion barrier, {{has an important}} effect {{on the fate of}} drug delivery systems in the gastrointestinal tract. To study the fate of microemulsions in the mucus layer, four microemulsion formulations with different particle sizes and lipid compositions were prepared. The microemulsion-mucin interaction was demonstrated by the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method. Moreover, the microemulsions were observed aggregated into micron-sized emulsions by laser confocal microscopy. We concluded the microemulsion-mucin interaction not only led to microemulsions closely adhered to mucins but also destroyed the structure of microemulsions. At last, the diffusion of blank microemulsions and microemulsion-carried drugs (resveratrol and <b>hymecromone)</b> through mucin solutions was determined by the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) method and the Franz diffusion cell method. The results demonstrated the diffusion of microemulsions was significantly hindered by mucin solutions. The particle size of microemulsions had a negligible effect on the diffusion coefficients. However, the type of lipid played an important role, which could form hydrophobic interactions with mucins. Interestingly, microemulsion-carried drugs with different core/shell locations seemed to suffer different fates in the mucin solutions. The drug incorporated in the oil core of microemulsions, resveratrol, was transported through the mucus layer by the carriers, while the drug incorporated in the surfactant shell of microemulsions, <b>hymecromone,</b> was separated from the carriers and diffused toward the epithelium in the form of free molecules...|$|E
40|$|The {{retained}} {{stone in}} the common bile duct remains {{a problem for the}} surgeon. Although more effective methods are available, mechanical flushing of the bile duct is, when successful, a simple solution. Pharmacological dilatation of the sphincter of Oddi is a logical adjunct to flushing. Pressure changes in the bile duct during flushing were studied in 20 postoperative patients with T-tube drains and the effectiveness of two drugs in reducing Omnopon induced spasm of the sphincter was compared. <b>Hymecromone</b> intravenously and lignocaine via the T-tube were equally effective, reducing sphincter activity in the majority of patients, but there was considerable individual variation...|$|E
40|$|Nature often {{produces}} compounds with a {{high degree}} of symmetry to reduce structural information and complexity. Synthesis of identical twin drugs, through the linkage of two identical pharmacophoric entities, is a classical strategy to produce more potent and/or selective drugs. Herein, two units of the privileged core of the coumarin <b>hymecromone</b> were linked together using “click chemistry”. Synthesis of 1 -[2 -(4 -Methyl- 7 -coumarinyloxy) ethyl]- 4 -(5 -{ 1 -[2 -(4 -methyl- 7 -coumarinyloxy) ethyl]- 1 H- 1, 2, 3 -triazol- 4 -yl}pentyl) - 1 H- 1, 2, 3 -triazole was achieved by coupling of two identical units of an azido coumarin with a symmetrical alkine using copper(I) -catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction, in good yields and with complete regioselectivity...|$|E
