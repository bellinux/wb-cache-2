5|$|The ECB targets {{interest}} rates rather than exchange rates {{and in general}} does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This {{is because of the}} implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, which implies a central bank cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency. In the years following the Single <b>European</b> <b>Act,</b> the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or floating. The result of the ECB maintaining historically low {{interest rates}} and restricting money supply has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners. However, in 2010, the euro started on a sharp decline. Starting at U.S$1.60 in 2008, and dropping to US$1.04 in 2015.In the following months € recovered till the value of 1.19 U.S.$. The Canadian dollar in the long term had a decline against €.|$|E
5|$|The Malfatti and Mansholt Commissions {{followed}} with work on monetary co-operation {{and the first}} enlargement to the north in 1973. With that enlargement the Commission's membership increased to thirteen under the Ortoli Commission (the United Kingdom as a large member was granted two Commissioners), which dealt with the enlarged community during economic and international instability at that time. The external representation of the Community {{took a step forward}} when President Roy Jenkins, recruited to the presidency in January 1977 from his role as Home Secretary of the United Kingdom's Labour government, became the first President to attend a G8 summit on behalf of the Community. Following the Jenkins Commission, Gaston Thorn's Commission oversaw the Community's enlargement to the south, in addition to beginning work on the Single <b>European</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The <b>European</b> Communities <b>Act</b> 1972 gave Community {{legislation}} {{the force}} of law in the United Kingdom: section 2(1) reads: [...] "All such rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions {{from time to time}} created or arising by or under the Treaties... are without further enactment to be given legal effect or used in the United Kingdom shall be recognised and available in law, and be enforced, allowed and followed".

25|$|Under the Community, the European Parliament (formerly the European Parliamentary Assembly) had an {{advisory}} role to the Council and Commission. There {{were a number}} of Community legislative procedures, at first there was only the consultation procedure, which meant Parliament had to be consulted, although it was often ignored. The Single <b>European</b> <b>Act</b> gave Parliament more power, with the assent procedure giving it a right to veto proposals and the cooperation procedure giving it equal power with the Council if the Council was not unanimous.|$|E
25|$|He had {{a primary}} {{role in the}} {{intergovernmental}} building of a report into improving co-operation of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1984 during Ireland's Presidency. His appointment was not without controversy with FitzGerald who proposed the appointment of Dooge insisting with him despite German pressure for their former President, Karl Carstens, {{to be given the}} role. This work (The Dooge Report) is credited as helping form the basis of the Single <b>European</b> <b>Act</b> and the Treaty of Maastricht with much of the language used the same.|$|E
25|$|Before the Single <b>European</b> <b>Act</b> the Consultation {{procedure}} {{was the most}} widely used legislative procedure in the then European Community. Consultation is still used for legislation concerning internal market exemptions and competition law. The procedure is also used in relation to the Union's advisory bodies such as the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee that are required to be consulted under a range of areas under the treaties affecting their area of expertise. Such a procedure takes place in addition to consultation with the European Parliament or the other legislative procedures.|$|E

25|$|With the {{prospect}} of further enlargement, {{and a desire to}} increase areas of co-operation, the Single <b>European</b> <b>Act</b> was signed by the foreign ministers on the 17 and 28 February 1986 in Luxembourg and the Hague respectively. In a single document it dealt with reform of institutions, extension of powers, foreign policy cooperation and the single market. It came into force on 1 July 1987. The act was followed by work on what would be the Maastricht Treaty, which was agreed on 10 December 1991, signed the following year and coming into force on 1 November 1993 establishing the European Union.|$|E
25|$|Foreign policy {{co-operation}} between {{member states}} {{dates from the}} establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the common commercial policy. Steps for a more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. It was not, however, until 1987 when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single <b>European</b> <b>Act.</b> EPC was renamed as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after its}} election, Parliament {{became the first}} Community {{institution}} to propose that the Community adopt the flag of Europe. The European Council agreed to this and adopted the Symbols of Europe {{as those of the}} Community in 1984. The European Council, or European summit, had developed since the 1960s as an informal meeting of the Council at the level of heads of state. It had originated from then-French President Charles de Gaulle's resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (e.g. the Commission) over the integration process. It was mentioned in the treaties {{for the first time in}} the Single <b>European</b> <b>Act</b> (see below).|$|E

500|$|As such, the European Council {{had already}} existed before it gained the {{status as an}} {{institution}} of the European Union with the entering into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, but even after it had been mentioned in the treaties (since the Single <b>European</b> <b>Act)</b> it could only take political decisions, not formal legal acts. However, when necessary, the Heads of State or Government could also meet as the Council of Ministers and take formal decisions in that role. Sometimes, this would was even compulsory, e.g. Article 214(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community provided (before it was amended by the Treaty of Lisbon) that ‘the Council, meeting {{in the composition of}} Heads of State or Government and acting by a qualified majority, shall nominate the person it intends to appoint as President of the Commission’ (emphasis added); the same rule applied in some monetary policy provisions introduced by the Maastricht Treaty (e.g. Article 109j TEC). In that case, what was politically part of a European Council meeting was legally a meeting of the Council of Ministers. When the European Council, already introduced into the treaties by the Single <b>European</b> <b>Act,</b> became an institution by virtue of the Treaty of Lisbon, this was no longer necessary, and the [...] "Council [...] meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government", was replaced in these instances by the European Council now taking formal legally binding decisions in these cases (...)
