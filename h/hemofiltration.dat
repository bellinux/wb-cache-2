5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous <b>hemofiltration</b> and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous <b>hemofiltration</b> is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. <b>Hemofiltration</b> is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E
5|$|Lactic {{acidosis}} {{is initially}} treated with sodium bicarbonate, although high doses are not recommended, as this may increase intracellular acidosis. Acidosis {{that does not}} respond to administration of sodium bicarbonate may require further management with standard hemodialysis or continuous venovenous <b>hemofiltration.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is {{large quantities of}} intravenous fluids. Other treatments may include dialysis or <b>hemofiltration</b> in more severe cases. Once urine output is established sodium bicarbonate and mannitol are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. Outcomes are generally good if treated early. Complications may include high blood potassium, low blood calcium, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and compartment syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In {{adults and}} {{children}} {{over the age of}} 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30â€“40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous <b>hemofiltration,</b> although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of mild {{caffeine}} intoxication {{is directed}} toward symptom relief; severe intoxication may require peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or <b>hemofiltration.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{improvement}} with fluid resuscitation, therapy-resistant hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or fluid overload may necessitate artificial {{support in the}} form of dialysis or <b>hemofiltration.</b>|$|E
25|$|Severe cases require {{hemodialysis}} or <b>hemofiltration,</b> {{which are}} the most rapid methods of removing potassium from the body. These are typically used if the underlying cause cannot be corrected swiftly while temporizing measures are instituted or there is no response to these measures.|$|E
25|$|Renal {{replacement}} therapy, such as with hemodialysis, may be instituted in {{some cases}} of AKI. Renal replacement therapy can be applied intermittently (IRRT) and continuously (CRRT). Study results regarding differences in outcomes between IRRT and CRRT are inconsistent. A systematic {{review of the literature}} in 2008 demonstrated no difference in outcomes between the use of intermittent hemodialysis and continuous venovenous <b>hemofiltration</b> (CVVH) (a type of continuous hemodialysis). Among critically ill patients, intensive renal replacement therapy with CVVH does not appear to improve outcomes compared to less intensive intermittent hemodialysis. However, other studies demonstrated that compared with IRRT, initiation of CRRT is associated with a lower likelihood of chronic dialysis.|$|E
2500|$|In severe intoxication, hemoperfusion or <b>hemofiltration</b> {{can be an}} {{effective}} means of hastening elimination of the drug from the body. Supportive therapy should be given to all patients experiencing an overdose and urine output should be monitored. Supplemental L-carnitine is indicated in patients having an acute overdose and also prophylactically in high risk patients. Acetyl-L-carnitine lowers hyperammonemia less markedly than L-carnitine.|$|E
50|$|Continuous <b>hemofiltration</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in a 1977 paper by Kramer et al. {{as a treatment for}} fluid overload. <b>Hemofiltration</b> is most commonly used in an intensive care unit setting, where it is either given as 8- to 12-hour treatments, so called SLEF (slow extended <b>hemofiltration),</b> or as CHF (continuous <b>hemofiltration),</b> also sometimes called continuous veno-venous <b>hemofiltration</b> (CVVH) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Hemodiafiltration (SLED-F or CHDF or CVVHDF) also is widely used in this fashion. In the United States, the substitution fluid used in CHF or CHDF is commercially prepared, prepackaged, and sterile (or sometimes is prepared in the local hospital pharmacy), avoiding regulatory issues of on-line creation of replacement fluid from dialysis solution.|$|E

50|$|As in dialysis, in <b>hemofiltration</b> one {{achieves}} {{movement of}} solutes across a semi-permeable membrane. However, solute movement with <b>hemofiltration</b> {{is governed by}} convection rather than by diffusion. With <b>hemofiltration,</b> dialysate is not used. Instead, a positive hydrostatic pressure drives water and solutes across the filter membrane from the blood compartment to the filtrate compartment, from which it is drained. Solutes, both small and large, get dragged through the membrane at a similar rate by {{the flow of water}} that has been engendered by the hydrostatic pressure. Thus convection overcomes the reduced removal rate of larger solutes (due to their slow speed of diffusion) seen in hemodialysis.|$|E

50|$|The {{decision}} to initiate dialysis or <b>hemofiltration</b> {{in patients with}} kidney failure depends on several factors. These {{can be divided into}} acute or chronic indications.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, <b>hemofiltration,</b> also haemofiltration, is a renal {{replacement}} therapy {{which is used}} in the intensive care setting. It is usually used to treat acute kidney injury (AKI), but may be of benefit in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome or sepsis. During <b>hemofiltration,</b> a patient's blood is passed through a set of tubing (a filtration circuit) via a machine to a semipermeable membrane (the filter) where waste products and water (collectively called ultrafiltrate) are removed by convection. Replacement fluid is added and the blood is returned to the patient.|$|E

50|$|Acute {{kidney failure}} after chemotherapy. The {{major cause of}} acute kidney failure in this setting is hyperphosphatemia, and the main {{therapeutic}} means is hemodialysis.

5000|$|Nils Alwall (1904, Kiaby - 1986), a Swedish professor, was {{a pioneer}} in {{hemodialysis}} and the inventor {{of one of the}} first practical dialysis machines.

50|$|Hemoperfusion or haemoperfusion (see {{spelling}} differences) is {{a method}} of filtering the blood extracorporeally (that is, outside the body) to remove a toxin. As with other extracorporeal methods, such as hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), <b>hemofiltration</b> (HF), and hemodiafiltration (HDF), the blood travels from the patient into a machine, gets filtered, and then travels back into the patient, typically by venovenous access (out of a vein and back into a vein).|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} is made on biochemical analysis of blood (often initially on arterial blood gas samples), and once confirmed, generally a need exists {{to establish the}} underlying cause to treat the acidosis. In some situations, <b>hemofiltration</b> (purification of the blood) is temporarily required. In rare chronic forms of lactic acidosis caused by mitochondrial disease, a specific diet or dichloroacetate may be used. The prognosis of lactic acidosis depends largely on the underlying cause; in some situations (such as severe infections), it indicates {{an increased risk of}} death.|$|E
50|$|Renal {{replacement}} therapy (RRT) is therapy that replaces the normal blood-filtering {{function of the}} kidneys. It is used when the kidneys are not working well, which is called renal failure and includes acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Renal {{replacement therapy}} includes dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis), <b>hemofiltration,</b> and hemodiafiltration, which are various ways of filtration of blood with or without machine. Renal replacement therapy also includes kidney transplantation, which is the ultimate form of replacement in that the old kidney {{is replaced by a}} donor kidney.|$|E
