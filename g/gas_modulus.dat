At low pressure (shallow depth < 2000 m), <b>gas</b> <b>modulus</b> {{is much less}} than 0. 1 GPa. Even few percent volume fraction of gas can drastically reduce the modulus of gas-water mixture. However, at a high pressure condition, modulus of gas-water mixture shows progressive decrease with increasing gas saturation and results in differentiable DHI attribute. Fluid modulus depends on composition, distribution and reservoir conditions, which {{are a result of}} complicated geological processes which form a reservoir...|$|E

For ideal <b>gases</b> the bulk <b>modulus</b> K is simply the gas pressure multiplied by the dimensionless adiabatic index, which is about 1.4 for air under normal conditions of pressure and temperature.|$|R

30|$|Brittleness of rock plays a {{significant}} role in exploration and development of shale <b>gas</b> reservoirs. Young’s <b>modulus</b> and Poisson’s ratio are the key parameters for evaluating the rock brittleness in shale gas exploration because their combination relationship can quantitatively characterize the rock brittleness. The high-value anomaly of Young’s modulus and the low-value anomaly of Poisson’s ratio represent high brittleness of shale. The technique of pre-stack amplitude variation with angle inversion allows geoscientists to estimate Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio from seismic data. A model constrained basis pursuit inversion method is proposed for stably estimating Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. Test results of synthetic gather data show that Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio can be estimated reasonably. With the novel method, the inverted Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of real field data focus the layer boundaries better, which is helpful for us to evaluate the brittleness of shale gas reservoirs. The results of brittleness evaluation show a good agreement with the results of well interpretation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{research}} activities {{developed during the}} first year of this project. The main tasks accomplished and reported in this paper are: a) the development of new computational equation of state (EOS) for granite. One-dimensional calculations using this EOS captures the first principles physics of the near source region and identifies the critical material properties for cavity dynamics. Cavity dynamics are an important consideration for methods that are used to determine accurate estimates of yield under varying emplacement conditions; and b) the extension of the newly developed material models to the analysis of scaled depth of burial and free surface effects in a 2 D heterogeneous structure. Efforts in this area are focused on a better understanding of the source stress-cage region as well as free surface Rayleigh and shear wave generation. A strong motion code for uniform source region structures was used to investigate the dependence of cavity dynamics and final radius on material properties (Young’s <b>modulus,</b> shear <b>modulus,</b> <b>gas</b> porosity, overburden, etc.). The material model developed was obtained by taking the PILEDRIVER and the HARDHAT nuclear test events as the main design references. The following aspects of the problem were identified as the driving points when developing the material model: velocity profiles at given stations (near field), source modeling alternatives (iron pill vs. ideal gas vs. Hydses/SESAME), energy partition after the shot, peak velocity and peak displacement attenuatio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn seismic applications, {{the bulk}} modulus of porous media {{saturated}} with liquid and gas phases is often estimated using Gassmann's fluid substitution formula, {{in which the}} effective bulk modulus of the two-phase fluid is the Reuss average of the gas and liquid bulk moduli. This averaging procedure, referred to as Wood's approximation, holds if the liquid and gas phases are homogeneously distributed within the pore space down to sizes well below the seismic wavelength and if the phase transfer processes between liquid and gas domains induced by the pressure variations of the seismic wave are negligible over the timescale of the wave period. Using existing theoretical results and low-frequency acoustic measurements in bubbly liquids, we argue that the latter assumption of "frozen" phases, valid for large enough frequencies, is likely to fail in the seismic frequency range where lower effective bulk modulus and velocity, together with dispersion and attenuation effects, are expected. We provide a simple method, which extends to reservoir fluids a classical result by Landau and Lifshitz valid for pure fluids, to compute the effective bulk modulus of thermodynamically equilibrated liquid and gas phases. For low <b>gas</b> saturation, this <b>modulus</b> is significantly lower than its Wood's counterpart, especially at the crossing of bubble point conditions. A seismic reflector associated to a phase transition between a monophasic and a two-phase fluid thus will appear. We discuss the consequences of these results for various seismic applications including fizz water discrimination and hydrocarbon reservoir depletion and CO 2 geological storage monitoring. © 2013 Saudi Society for Geosciences...|$|R
