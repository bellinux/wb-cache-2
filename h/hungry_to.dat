25|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} one of the {{developmental}} hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she really is. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears as if by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being <b>hungry.</b> <b>To</b> feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.|$|E
25|$|Income {{grants are}} argued to be vastly more {{efficient}} in extending basic needs {{to the poor}} than subsidizing supplies whose effectiveness in poverty alleviation is diluted by the non-poor who enjoy the same subsidized prices. With cars and other appliances, the wealthiest 20% of Egypt uses about 93% of the country's fuel subsidies. In some countries, fuel subsidies are a larger part of the budget than health and education. A 2008 study concluded that {{the money spent on}} in-kind transfers in India in a year could lift all India's poor out of poverty for that year if transferred directly. The primary obstacle argued against direct cash transfers is the impractically for poor countries of such large and direct transfers. In practice, payments determined by complex iris scanning are used by war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo and Afghanistan, while India is phasing out its fuel subsidies in favor of direct transfers. Additionally, in aid models, the famine relief model increasingly used by aid groups calls for giving cash or cash vouchers to the <b>hungry</b> <b>to</b> pay local farmers instead of buying food from donor countries, often required by law, as it wastes money on transport costs.|$|E

500|$|Kennedy now {{centered}} a {{line between}} Howie Meeker and Vic Lynn and they clicked [...] "immediately". These were the line-mates Smythe {{had been trying to}} find for Kennedy since 1945.

Meeker had just returned from the war and Lynn had come up from the American league and both were <b>hungry</b> <b>to</b> stay in the NHL. [...] "We were very eager people", Kennedy recalled.

500|$|In late 1967, an acetate of {{fourteen}} of Dylan's compositions was made, from which demos circulated among music groups {{who might be}} interested in recording some of the songs. Artists including Peter, Paul and Mary, Manfred Mann and the Byrds eventually did. Dylan's demo tapes were soon heard by music journalists, including Rolling Stones Jann Wenner, who wrote a front-page story in that magazine entitled [...] "Dylan's Basement Tape Should Be Released". This made the general public <b>hungry</b> <b>to</b> hear the music, and in July 1969 a bootleg called Great White Wonder, which included some of the Big Pink songs, came out. Other Basement Tape bootlegs followed.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics have}} {{compared}} Gravity with other notable films set in space. Lindsey Weber of Vulture.com said {{the choice of}} Ed Harris for the voice of Mission Control is a reference to Apollo 13. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter suggests the way [...] "a weightless Stone goes floating about in nothing but her underwear" [...] references Alien (1979). Other critics made connections with [...] (1968). James Cameron praised the film and stated, [...] "I think it's the best space photography ever done, I think it's the best space film ever done, and it's the movie I've been <b>hungry</b> <b>to</b> see for an awful long time". Empire Online, Ask Men and The Huffington Post also considered Gravity {{to be one of}} the best space films ever made, though The Huffington Post later included Gravity on their list of [...] "8 Movies From The Last 15 Years That Are Super Overrated". Gravity was ranked second on Metacritic's Film Critic Top Ten List scorecard for 2013.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, New York artist Sophia Wallace {{started work}} on a {{multimedia}} project to challenge misconceptions about the clitoris. Based on O'Connell's 1998 research, Wallace's work emphasizes the sheer scope {{and size of the}} human clitoris. She says that ignorance of this still seems to be pervasive in modern society. [...] "It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary," [...] she said. [...] "Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible." [...] The project is called Cliteracy and it includes a [...] "clit rodeo", which is an interactive, climb-on model of a giant golden clitoris, including its inner parts, produced with the help of sculptor Kenneth Thomas. [...] "It's been a showstopper wherever it's been shown. People are <b>hungry</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to talk about}} this," [...] Wallace said. [...] "I love seeing men standing up for the clit [...] Not having access to the pleasure that is your birthright is a deeply political act." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1842, {{at the age}} of four, {{she began}} her {{education}} at the Chiefs' Children's School (later known as the Royal School). She, along with her classmates, had been formally proclaimed by Kamehameha III as eligible for the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Liliʻuokalani later noted that these [...] "pupils were exclusively persons whose claims to the throne were acknowledged." [...] She, along with her two older brothers James Kaliokalani and David Kalākaua, and her thirteen royal cousins, was taught in English by American missionaries Amos Starr Cooke and his wife, Juliette Montague Cooke. The children were taught reading, spelling, penmanship, arithmetic, geometry, algebra, physics, geography, history, bookkeeping, singing and English composition by the missionary couple who had to control the moral and sexual development of their charges. Liliʻuokalani was placed in the youngest section of the class with Princess Victoria Kamāmalu, Mary Polly Paʻaʻāina, and John William Pitt Kīnaʻu. In later life, Liliʻuokalani would look back unfavorably on her early education remembering being [...] "sent <b>hungry</b> <b>to</b> bed" [...] and the 1848 measles epidemic that claimed the life of a classmate Moses Kekūāiwa and her younger sister Kaʻiminaʻauao. The boarding school run by the Cookes was discontinued around 1850, so she, along with her former classmate Victoria Kamāmalu, was sent to the relocated day school (also called Royal School) run by Reverend Edward G. Beckwith.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{widespread}} belief Laudrup joined arch-rivals Real Madrid in {{an attempt}} to [...] "get back" [...] at Cruyff, the decision was based on the fact Real Madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy, like Barcelona when he decided to join them. Laudrup said, [...] "People say I wanted to go to Real Madrid just to get revenge. I say revenge from what? I've had a perfect time; five fantastic years here [...] I went to Madrid because they were so <b>hungry</b> <b>to</b> win, and they had four or five players who went to the World Cup.

2500|$|On 19 October 1797 the French Directory {{received}} a document from a Polish general, Michał Sokolnicki, entitled [...] "Aperçu sur la Russie".

2500|$|As the {{emergence}} of rock 'n roll music began in the 1950s, Williams left no doubt as to where {{he stood on the}} subject: against. [...] "Most of it's so bad it's embarrassing," [...] he said. [...] "In the days of the big bands, a vocalist {{had to be able to}} sing....I believe teenagers are <b>hungry</b> <b>to</b> hear good music, and at some point we must assume a lot of the blame for the quality of what is being heard. I use the word 'we' to mean disc jockeys and radio stations in general." [...] A well-known advertisement of the era showed Williams holding his nose under the caption [...] "We asked William B. Williams of WNEW Radio what he thought of rock 'n' roll." [...] Still, beginning in the late 1950s, WNEW began mixing in softer tunes from rock artists, which continued into the 1960s. While WNEW was still playing pop standards, soft rock was a big part of the format, making them a MOR station. Williams hated most of these songs, but played them when he had to.|$|E
