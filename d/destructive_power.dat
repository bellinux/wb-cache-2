5|$|Autocannons {{are often}} found in aircraft, where they {{replaced}} machine guns and as shipboard anti-aircraft weapons, as they provide greater <b>destructive</b> <b>power</b> than machine guns.|$|E
5|$|Philosophically, Newall {{remained}} a close follower of Trenchard during the interwar period; {{his time in}} the Independent Bombing Force had left him convinced that strategic bombing was an exceptionally powerful weapon, and one that could not effectively be defended against. In this, he was a supporter of the standard doctrine of the day, which suggested that the <b>destructive</b> <b>power</b> of a bomber force was sufficiently great that it could cripple an industrial economy in short order, and that so merely its presence could potentially serve as an effective deterrent. He was promoted to air chief marshal on 1 April 1937.|$|E
5|$|In March 1942, Bush sent {{a report}} to Roosevelt {{outlining}} work by Robert Oppenheimer on the nuclear cross section of uranium-235. Oppenheimer's calculations, which Bush had George Kistiakowsky check, estimated that the critical mass of a sphere of uranium-235 was {{in the range of}} 2.5 to 5 kilograms, with a <b>destructive</b> <b>power</b> of around 2,000 tons of TNT. Moreover, it appeared that plutonium might be even more fissile. After conferring with Brigadier General Lucius D. Clay about the construction requirements, Bush drew up a submission for $85 million in fiscal year 1943 for four pilot plants, which he forwarded to Roosevelt on June 17, 1942. With the Army on board, Bush moved to streamline oversight of the project by the OSRD, replacing the S-1 Section with a new S-1 Executive Committee.|$|E

50|$|Due to his {{obsession}} with hunting other lifeforms, the Obliterator {{has failed to}} develop himself {{to the extent of}} the other Elders. He cannot travel in space unaided and has no <b>destructive</b> <b>powers</b> without his weapons. He also is not very intelligent. He is able to withstand blunt force trauma and direct energy blast from characters such as The Silver Surfer. His self made weapons are amongst the last remnants of his extinct race's technology. However over eons of time he has adapted and upgraded his tech, utilizing different components from different civilizations which in turn increases the <b>destructive</b> <b>powers</b> of his weapons.|$|R
5|$|The first cannon {{appeared}} in Russia in the 1370-1380s, although initially their use {{was confined to}} sieges and the defence of fortresses. The first mention of cannon in Russian chronicles is of tyufyaks, small howitzer-type cannon that fired case-shot, used to defend Moscow against Tokhtamysh Khan in 1382. Cannon co-existed with throwing-machines until the mid-15th century, when they overtook the latter in terms of <b>destructive</b> <b>power.</b> In 1446, a Russian city fell to cannon fire for the first time, although its wall was not destroyed. However {{it was not until}} 1475, when Ivan III established the first Russian cannon foundry in Moscow, which {{was the beginning of the}} native cannon production industry. The first stone wall to be destroyed in Russia by cannon fire came in 1481.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{implementation}} of this strategy was left to the commander on site, Major General Walter Walker, {{a veteran of the}} Burma Campaign of the Second World War who had learned the hard lessons of the Malayan Emergency. Walker realised that a defensive strategy would leave all British forces tied down defending their bases, and instead determined to take the initiative from the aggressive Indonesians. Walker ordered that one-third of a unit should be left defending its base, which would be one of many along the border, while the remainder patrolled the jungle, foraying into Indonesian territory and attempting to keep them tied down at their headquarters instead. Thus, the British would attempt to control the jungle in the style of classic guerrilla warfare. But Walker was walking on a tightrope. His instructions, as were given to most colonial commanders, were to use 'minimum force' so as not to provoke Sukarno into escalating the conflict. However, he had to apply a certain level of <b>destructive</b> <b>power</b> to cow the aggressive and assertive Indonesians.|$|E
5|$|To {{protect and}} support the {{multitude}} of ships sailing for maritime interests into {{the waters of the}} East China Sea and Yellow Sea (to Korea and Japan), Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Red Sea, it was necessary to establish an official standing navy. The Song dynasty therefore established China's first permanent navy in 1132, with a headquarters at Dinghai. With a permanent navy, the Song were prepared to face the naval forces of the Jin on the Yangtze River in 1161, in the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi. During these battles the Song navy employed swift paddle wheel driven naval vessels armed with traction trebuchet catapults aboard the decks that launched gunpowder bombs. Although the Jin forces commanded by Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing) boasted 70,000 men on 600 warships, and the Song forces only 3,000 men on 120 warships, the Song dynasty forces were victorious in both battles due to the <b>destructive</b> <b>power</b> of the bombs and the rapid assaults by paddle wheel ships. The strength of the navy was heavily emphasized after that. A century after the navy was founded it had grown in size to 52,000 fighting marines.|$|E

5|$|Within a {{few years}} of the end of World War II, the United States {{deactivated}} all of its remaining battleships and placed them in the United States Navy reserve fleets. Most of these ships were eventually scrapped, but the four Iowa-class battleships were not, and on several occasions {{one or more of these}} four battleships were reactivated for naval gunfire support. The U.S. Navy has held onto the four Iowa-class battleships long after the upkeep and maintenance of operating and maintaining a battleship and the arrival of aircraft and precision guided munitions led other nations to scrap their big-gun fleets. Congress was largely responsible for keeping the four Iowa-class battleships in the United States Navy reserve fleets and on the Naval Vessel Register as long as they did. The lawmakers argued that the battleships' large-caliber guns had a useful <b>destructive</b> <b>power</b> that is lacking in the smaller, cheaper, and faster guns mounted by U.S. cruisers and destroyers.|$|E
5|$|A {{male figure}} {{depicted}} holding certain {{objects such as}} a conch (symbol of eternal, heavenly space) and a wheel (eternal time and <b>destructive</b> <b>power)</b> is Vishnu. If a female figure is depicted holding these objects, she is seen as his consort, Lakshmi. In all the depictions Vishnu is holding four objects: a conch, a wheel, a lotus and a Kaumodaki (mace). These can be held {{in any of the}} icon's hands, making possible twenty-four different forms of Vishnu, each with a unique name. Apart from these, Vishnu is depicted in any of his ten avataras, which include Vishnu sitting on Anantha (the celestial snake and keeper of life energy also known as Shesha), Vishnu with Lakshmi seated on his lap (Lakshminarayana), with the head of a lion disembowelling a demon on his lap (Lakshminarasimha), with head of a boar walking over a demon (Varaha), in the Krishna avatar (as Venugopala or the cow herder playing the Venu (flute), dancing on the head of the snake Kaliya, lifting a hill such as Govardhana), with his feet over head of a small figure (Vamana), along with Indra riding an elephant, with Lakshmi seated on Garuda, and the eagle (stealing the parijata tree).|$|E
5|$|Stroma's violent storms {{occasionally}} wrought destruction on the island. In December 1862, a great storm broke {{over the}} island {{with such force that}} it swept right across the northern end of Stroma, leaving wreckage, rocks and seaweed {{on the top of the}} 100-foot-high cliffs and destroying the channels leading to the watermill. However, the sea's <b>destructive</b> <b>power</b> had one positive benefit for the islanders, if not for those caught out by the currents and shoals of the Pentland Firth. Over the last two hundred years, over sixty vessels ranging from fishing boats to large cargo vessels have been wrecked on the shores of Stroma, with many more vessels coming to grief on the reefs and shoals of the neighbouring mainland and Orkney coasts. Many vessels – at least 560 between 1830 and 1990 – have had to be refloated in the Pentland Firth after getting into difficulties. Shipwrecks were a valuable source of income, timber and goods for the islanders, who would salvage liberally – and often with little regard for legality – whenever a stranded ship was abandoned. The building of Stroma's first lighthouse in the late 19th century was initially opposed by some of the islanders who were more concerned with profiting from shipwrecks than preventing them.|$|E
50|$|Although {{based on}} folklore, the story {{contains}} strong autobiographical elements from Burroughs' own life: he accidentally shot {{his own wife}} in a drunken attempt at recreating the William Tell legend, and the story as a whole may be construed as a warning tale about the <b>destructive</b> <b>powers</b> of addiction.|$|R
50|$|Gunpowder {{is a low}} explosive, best used as a propellant. Guncotton, {{the first}} high explosive, more useful for its <b>destructive</b> <b>powers,</b> was invented by Dr Christian Schonbein, of the University of Basel, in 1846.

25|$|Tsunamis {{cause damage}} by two mechanisms: the smashing {{force of a}} wall of water {{travelling}} at high speed, and the <b>destructive</b> <b>power</b> of a large volume of water draining off the land and carrying {{a large amount of}} debris with it, even with waves that {{do not appear to be}} large.|$|E

25|$|His era was {{especially}} one of artistic development. But it was Ningirsu {{who received the}} majority of Gudea’s attention. Ningirsu the war god, for whom Gudea built maces, spears, and axes, all appropriately named for the <b>destructive</b> <b>power</b> of Ningirsu—enormous and gilt. However, the devotion for Ningirsu {{was especially}} inspired {{by the fact that}} this was Gudea's personal god and that Ningirsu was since ancient times the main god of the Lagashite region (together with his spouse Ba'u or Baba).|$|E
25|$|With MEDUSA finally launched, {{the mayor}} begins guiding London east towards the Anti-Traction League.

25|$|In {{the film}} Rogue One, it is {{revealed}} that the Death Star's superlaser is powered by multiple reactors, allowing it to vary its <b>destructive</b> <b>power</b> depending on the target. Skeptical of the station's power, Tarkin ordered that it first be tested on Jedha City using a single reactor. Subsequently, a second single-reactor test would destroy their installation on Scarif, along with the Rebel strike force who had successfully stolen the station's plans. The destruction of the planet Alderaan {{would be the first}} time the Death Star was tested with all reactors employed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>destructive</b> <b>powers</b> of the {{earthquake}} reached other provinces of the islands.

50|$|The Fomorians seem to {{have been}} gods who {{represent}} the harmful or <b>destructive</b> <b>powers</b> of nature; personifications of chaos, darkness, death, blight and drought.

25|$|The {{simplest}} form {{of technology}} is the {{development and use of}} basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing <b>destructive</b> <b>power,</b> from clubs to nuclear weapons.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, Typhoon Nuri hit Hong Kong. The Observatory was criticised for {{hoisting}} a Typhoon Signal No. 8, {{which some}} considered unnecessary, and hoisting it too late.

In response to claims that Typhoon Signal No. 8, Lam stated that at least two people had been killed by the typhoon. He also stated that Hong Kong had been 'incredibly lucky' that the <b>destructive</b> <b>power</b> of the typhoon was not as strong as predicted.|$|E
25|$|The Dover Straits {{earthquake}} of 1580 {{is among}} the first recorded earthquakes in the North Sea measuring between 5.6 and 5.9 on the Richter scale. This event caused extensive damage in Calais both through its tremors and possibly triggered a tsunami, though this has never been confirmed. The theory is a vast underwater landslide in the English Channel was triggered by the earthquake, which in turn caused a tsunami. The tsunami triggered by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake reached Holland, although the waves had lost their <b>destructive</b> <b>power.</b> The largest earthquake ever recorded in the United Kingdom was the 1931 Dogger Bank earthquake, which measured 6.1 on the Richter magnitude scale and caused a small tsunami that flooded parts of the British coast.|$|E
