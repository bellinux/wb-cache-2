40|$|Passenger ferries serve {{a variety}} of {{transport}} needs in the U. S., such as providing vital links across bodies of water, and supplementing highway bridges. In some cases {{in which there is}} a ferry connection but no bridge, a bridge would be impractical; in other cases, a bridge might be feasible. The paper compares the energy consumption of ferries and motor vehicles on bridges, to determine which link is more fuel efficient. One finding is that limited data are available on ferry boat fuel consumption: despite there being 208 ferry boat operators in the U. S. as of 2008, only eight were providing energy use data to the National Transit Database. Examinations of three of the systems found that the passenger-MPG of the <b>ferries</b> <b>ranged</b> from 2. 61 to 14. 00 (1. 11 to 5. 95 km/L), while that of the motor vehicles on adjacent highway bridge connections ranged from 25. 34 to 32. 45 (10. 77 to 13. 79 km/L). Data from the eight systems are used to develop a ferry MPG model. The model is used to show that the Ryer Island and Charles Hall Ferries are less fuel efficient than hypothetical bridges in those locations. The fuel efficiencies and consumptions of the ferries would equal those of motor vehicles on the bridges, however, if smaller vessels were used, and if the frequency of service was reduced...|$|R
40|$|The Colorado River is {{the primary}} water source {{for much of the}} rapidly growing southwestern United States. Recent studies have {{projected}} reductions in Colorado River flows from less than 10 % to almost 50 % by midcentury because of climate change—a range that has clouded potential management responses. These differences in projections are attributable to variations in climate model projections but also to differing land surface model (LSM) sensitivities. This second contribution to uncertainty—specifically, variations in LSM runoff change with respect to precipitation (elasticities) and temperature (sensitivities) —are evaluated here through comparisons of multidecadal simulations from five commonly used LSMs (Catchment, Community Land Model, Noah, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model, and Variable Infiltration Capacity model) all applied over the Colorado River basin at 1 / 88 latitude by longitude spatial resolution. The annual elasticity of modeled runoff (fractional change in annual runoff divided by fractional change in annual precipitation) at Lees <b>Ferry</b> <b>ranges</b> from two to six for the different LSMs. Elasticities generally are higher in lower precipitation and/or runoff regimes; hence, the highest values are for models biased low in runoff production, and the range of elasticities is reduced to two to three when adjusted to current runoff climatology. Annual temperature sensitivities (percent change in annual runoff per degree change in annual temperature) range from declines of 2 % to as much as 9 % per degree Celsius increase at Lees Ferry. For some LSMs, small areas, primarily at midelevation, have increasing runoff with increasing temperature; however, on a spatial basis, most sensitivities are negative. 1...|$|R
500|$|The Boeing–Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche was {{intended}} to be an advanced five-blade armed reconnaissance and attack helicopter.

40|$|Continued {{interest}} in improving air {{quality in the}} United States along with renewed {{interest in}} the expansion of urban passenger ferry service has created concern about air pollution from ferry vessels. This paper presents a methodology for estimating the air pollution emissions from passenger ferries {{and the costs of}} emissions control strategies. The methodology is used to estimate the emis-sions and costs of retrofitting or re-powering ferries with seven technological options (combinations of propulsion and emission control systems) onto three vessels cur-rently in service in San Francisco Bay. The technologies include improved engine design, cleaner fuels (including natural gas), and exhaust gas cleanup devices. The three vessels span a range of ages and technologies, from a 25 -year-old monohull to a modern, high-speed catama-ran built only four years ago. By looking at a range of technologies, vessel designs, and service conditions, a sense of the broader implications of controlling emissions from passenger <b>ferries</b> across a <b>range</b> of vessels and service profiles is provided.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the performance}} of ferries operating along the Norwegian road networks. These ferries are of critical importance to the trunk road system, as they act as links in the road system by transporting vehicles across fjords. However, ferries are subsidised by the government because they operate at a loss. It is therefore important for governmental agencies to assess the performance {{in order to understand}} the potential for efficiency and productivity improvements (eg, by implementing alternative subsidy regimes). The performance of ferries (ie, technical efficiency and productivity) is estimated using the stochastic frontier approach to efficiency measurement and its subsequent Malmquist productivity indices. Technical inefficiency effects are modelled as ferry-specific external factors (eg, areas of operation or year of construction). The data are from the accounting period 2003 – 2005 and are comprised of 82 ferries. The results show that there is great potential for efficiency improvements among <b>ferries,</b> in the <b>range</b> of 19 %– 20 %. The external factors have a significant impact on efficiency, as the productivity of ferries has increased by approximately 2 % over the period studied and this progress is mainly due to advances in efficiency changes. This means that ferries generally have a tendency to improve their efficiency, but fail to adopt technologies for the reason that they are too old. These results should be valuable for policy decisions. The Norwegian government is currently considering tendering as a means of improving efficiency in the ferry sector. We advise that a change in the subsidy system alone is not enough to ensure efficiency improvements, unless incentives for investments in new ferries are included.

2500|$|Through FY 1961, {{the total}} cost of the B-58 program was $3 billion ($ billion in [...] dollars). A highly complex aircraft, it also {{required}} considerable maintenance, much of which required specialized equipment and ground personnel. For comparison, the average maintenance cost per flying hour for the B-47 was $361, for the B-52 it was $1,025 and for the B-58 it was $1,440. The B-58 also cost three times as much to operate as the B-52. The cost of maintaining and operating the two operational B-58 wings equaled that of six wings of B-52s. This included special detailed maintenance for the nose landing gear, which retracted in a complicated fashion to avoid the center payload. Further, compounding this, the B-58 had an unfavorably high accident rate: 26 B-58 aircraft were lost in accidents, 22.4% of total production. The SAC senior leadership had been doubtful about the aircraft type from the beginning, although its crews eventually became enthusiastic about the aircraft. General Curtis LeMay was never satisfied with the bomber and after a flight in one declared that it was too small, far too expensive to maintain in combat readiness and required an excessive number of aerial refuelings to complete a mission. Although the high altitude <b>ferry</b> <b>range</b> of the B-58 was better than the B-47, the lack of forward basing resulted in a requirement for more KC-135 tanker support.|$|E
