40|$|With the {{described}} {{measurements and}} theoretical estimations {{we have shown}} that ultrasonic backscattering is well suited to detect porosity and single pores in the near-surface range (0. 5 to 2 mm depth) in die-casting components of complicated shape. For the range directly below the surface down {{to a depth of}} 0. 5 mm the technique discussed here has to be further developed, for example by using oblique sound incidence with seperate transmitting and receiving transducers to avoid that scattering signals from pores are masked by the <b>entrance</b> <b>echo.</b> Furthermore scattering at the surface roughness has then to be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasound {{biomicroscopy}} (UBM) is a non-invasive {{imaging technique}} used in examination of several skin diseases {{but never in}} imaging hair and scalp diseases. Â  Main objective {{of this investigation was}} assessment of the efficacy of UBM for in vivo visualization of hair follicles in cases of alopecia areata (AA) and correlation of findings with histopathological findings. This study included 30 patients with AA. Two areas, one with AA and a control area, were marked, examined by UBM and then biopsied for histopathological examination. In patients with alopecia totalis (AT) or universalis (AU) only an AA area was examined. Non-echogenic conical shadows reaching the epidermal <b>entrance</b> <b>echo</b> (probably corresponding to the hair follicles) were seen and were wider and fewer in number in areas of AA than in normal control areas. No significant difference was found regarding number and width of hair follicles between UBM and histopathological examination. However, a significant increase in length of follicles in histopathology was detected, indicating that the UBM image was probably unable to reach the deepest part of the follicle. Main limitation of the study is small number of cases. No significant difference was found between UBM and histological measurements of hair follicle number and width in patients with AA, making UBM a useful tool for in vivo visualization of hair follicles. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} an objectively assessable procedure simulating simultaneous exposure to irritants and allergens in domestic and occupational environments, in order to evaluate differences in the reactivity to the combination of these substances in atopic and non-atopic nickel-sensitized subjects. Thirty-four nickel-sensitive patients, 20 of whom were affected by atopic dermatitis, underwent four patch tests with NiSO 4 0. 05 % aq. on two adjacent sites of both volar forearms, with a 24 -h application time. Two of the test sites were treated with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) 5 % for 30 min, before application of the nickel sulfate preparation. Echographic recordings were performed by a 20 -MHz B-scanner and processed by an image analysis program, providing a numerical representation of the picture data, based on the attribution of fictional values to the amplitudes of the echoes. The dermal inflammatory reaction was quantified by an amplitude band, marking the hypo-reflecting part of the dermis, whereas epidermal damage was assessed by a band highlighting the <b>entrance</b> <b>echo.</b> Pre-treatment with SLS of the skin area where nickel sulfate was subsequently applied greatly enhanced the allergic response at 24 and 72 h, both in subjects with atopic dermatitis and in subjects with allergic contact dermatitis. However, in atopics, the increase in the allergic reactivity after irritation of the skin was more pronounced both by clinical and by echographic evaluation. These observations stress the importance of the concurrent action of irritants and allergens in maintaining the dermatitis in atopics...|$|E

40|$|When warriors {{fall asleep}} within Heorot?s {{decorated}} walls, they initiate {{a sequence of}} events that ultimately ends in slaughter and death. This pattern of sleep, attack, and death predictably appears {{in each of the}} monster episodes. Humans sleep and fall prey to an otherworld attacker, who eventually receives death as punishment. Interestingly, the roles of the characters are reversed in the dragon scene. Here, the dragon?s sleep exposes him to harm {{at the hands of a}} human, the thief, whose guilt is transferred to Beowulf. In this way, sleep designates the victims and the attackers, but it also helps the audience predict the judgment that will take place at the end of each episode. This judgment becomes specifically Christian when contextualized by other Anglo-Saxon accounts of sleep. As in these texts, sleep in Beowulf functions as a liminal zone connecting the world of the humans with an Otherworld. The intersection of these worlds in Beowulf follows the structural paradigm of the popular ?Doomsday motif,? in which an angry Christ comes to earth to surprise a sleeping humanity. A study of the verbal and thematic similarities of Beowulf and Christ III best exemplifies this connection. Other mythographic traditions of Christian judgment within Anglo Saxon texts appear throughout Beowulf. Motifs of Christ?s second coming surround Grendel as he approaches Heorot, and his <b>entrance</b> <b>echoes</b> Christ?s harrowing of Hell. The fight in Grendel?s mother?s lair recalls redemption through water: Beowulf?s immersion represents baptism and the hilt of the sword which saves the Danish nation depicts the great Flood. Finally, the dragon?s fire and its resulting annihilation of a people, at least indirectly, resounds with apocalyptic undertones...|$|R
40|$|Skin {{reactions}} to 40 % nonanoic acid in propanol (NON) and to 4 % hydrochloric acid {{were evaluated by}} image analysis of 20 MHz B scan recordings (Dermascan C, Cortex Technology). 18 women, aged 18 to 45, were patch tested with 24 -h application time, and clinical and instrumental evaluations were performed {{at the beginning of}} the experiment, and 24 and 48 h after patch testing. To check possible regional variations in reactivity to NON and HCl, both substances were applied 2 x on the same forearm. As control tests, saline solution, propanol and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) 3 % were applied. Echographic images were processed by a program enabling numerical representation of picture data, based on attribution of fictional values to the echoes' amplitudes, selection of amplitude bands of interest, binary transformation of the image, and calculation of the extension of areas reflecting within the same amplitude range. Sonographic recordings were evaluated by an amplitude interval marking hyporeflecting parts of the dermis (corresponding to edema and inflammatory infiltration), and by a band highlighting the <b>entrance</b> <b>echo</b> (epidermis). Our evaluations showed that extension of the hypoechogenic area of the dermis increases according to intensity of inflammatory reaction for all irritant substances. A clear decrease in reflectivity of the epidermis echo at 24 h was visible at SLS patch test test sites, whereas at patch test sites performed with NON and HCl, there was a trend towards an increase in values of hyperreflecting pixels. No significant variations between data recorded at proximal compared to distal skin sites were observed for NON and HCl. In conclusion, the echographic technique provides a method for quantification of the dermal inflammatory reaction, and also for description of skin reactions induced by irritant substances, according to their specific epidermal effects...|$|E
