The applicability of this work is demonstrated for joining magnesium alloy AZ 31 B and carbon-fibre reinforced plastics. Dynamic effects, thermomechanical coupling, material damage laws, and contact criterion were taken into account in the model. The Johnson–Cook material constitutive equation was used, considering the effects of strain, strain rate, and temperature on material properties.

40|$|This thesis in Thermal <b>Flow</b> <b>Drilling</b> and Flowtap in thin {{metal sheet}} and pipes of copper and copper alloys had as {{objectives}} {{to know the}} comportment of copper and copper alloys sheet metal during the Thermal Flow Drill processes with normal tools, to know the best Speed and Feed machine data for the best bushing quality, to known the best Speed for Form Tapping processes and to know the best bush long in pure copper pipes for water solar interchange equipment. Thermal <b>Flow</b> <b>Drilling</b> (TFD) and Form Tapping (FT) {{is one of the}} research lines of the Institute of Production and Logistics (IPL) at University of Kassel. At December 1995, a work meeting of IPL, Santa Catarina University, Brazil, Buenos Aires University, Argentine, Tarapacá University (UTA), Chile members and the CEO of Flowdrill B. V. was held in Brazil. The group decided that the Manufacturing Laboratory (ML) of UTA would work with pure copper and brass alloys sheet metal and pure copper pipes in order to develop a water interchange solar heater. The Flowdrill BV Company sent tools to Tarapacá University in 1996. In 1999 IPL and the ML carried out an ALECHILE research project promoted by the DAAD and CONICyT in copper sheet metal and copper pipes and sheet metal a-brass alloys. The normal tools are lobed, conical tungsten carbide tool. When rotated at high speed and pressed with high axial force into sheet metal or thin walled tube generated heat softens the metal and allows the drill to feed forward produce a hole and simultaneously form a bushing from the displacement material. In the market exist many features but in this thesis is used short and longs normal tools of TFD. For reach the objectives it was takes as references four qualities of the frayed end bushing, where the best one is the quality class I. It was used pure copper and a-brass alloys sheet metals, with different thickness. It was used different TFD drills diameter for four thread type, from M- 5 to M 10. Similar to the Aluminium sheet metals studies it was used the predrilling processes with HSS drills around 30 % of the TFD diameter (1, 5 – 3, 0 mm D). In the next step is used only 2, 0 mm thick metal sheet, and 9, 2 mm TFD diameter for M- 10 thread. For the case of pure commercial copper pipes is used for ¾” inch diameter and 12, 8 mm (3 / 8 ”) TFD drill for holes for 3 / 8 ” pipes and different normal HSS drills for predrilling processes. The chemical sheet metal characteristics were takes as reference for the material behaviour. The Chilean pure copper have 99, 35 % of Cu and 0, 163 % of Zinc and the Chilean a-brass alloys have 75, 6 % of Cu and 24, 0 % of Zinc. It is used two German a-brass alloys; Nº 1 have 61, 6 % of Cu, 36, 03 % of Zinc and 2, 2 % of Pb and the German a-brass alloys Nº 2 have 63, 1 % of Cu, 36, 7 % of Zinc and 0 % of Pb. The equipments used were a HAAS CNC milling machine centre, a Kistler dynamometer, PC Pentium II, Acquisition card, TESTPOINT and XAct software, 3 D measurement machine, micro hardness, universal test machine, and metallographic microscope. During the test is obtained the feed force and momentum curves that shows the material behaviour with TFD processes. In general it is take three phases. It was possible obtain the best machining data for the different sheet of copper and a-brass alloys thick of Chilean materials and bush quality class I. In the case of a-brass alloys, the chemical components and the TFD processes temperature have big influence. The temperature reach to 400 º Celsius during the TFD processes and the a-brass alloys have some percents of Zinc the bush quality is class I. But when the a-brass alloys have some percents of Lead who have 200 º C melting point is not possible to obtain a bush, because the Lead gasify and the metallographic net broke. During the TFD processes the recrystallization structures occur around the Copper and a-brass alloy bush, who gives more hardness in these zones. When the threads were produce with Form Tapping processes with Flowtap tools, this hardness amount gives a high limit load of the thread when hey are tested in a special support that was developed for it. For eliminated the predrilling processes with normal HSS drills it was developed a compound tool. With this new tool it was possible obtain the best machining data for quality class I bush. For the copper pipes it is made bush without predrilling and the quality class IV was obtained. When it is was used predrilling processes, quality classes I bush were obtained. Then with different HSS drill diameter were obtained different long bush, where were soldering with four types soldering materials between pipes with 3 / 8 ” in a big one as ¾”. Those soldering unions were tested by traction test and all the 3 / 8 ” pipes broken, and the soldering zone doesn’t have any problem. Finally were developed different solar water interchange heaters and tested. As conclusions, the present Thesis shows that the Thermal <b>Flow</b> <b>Drilling</b> in thinner metal sheets of cooper and cooper alloys needs a predrilling process for frayed end quality class I bushings, similar to thinner sheets of aluminium bushes. The compound tool developed could obtain quality class I bushings and excludes predrilling processes. The bush recrystalization, product of the friction between the tool and the material, the hardness grows and it is advantageous for the Form Tapping. The methodology developed for commercial copper pipes permits to built water solar interchange heaters...|$|E
40|$|Geothermal {{exploration}} activity in Australia {{over the last}} decade has highlighted the poor surface heat flow data coverage in this country. While data coverage remains poor, a previous attempt to characterise the heat flow field of South Australia (Neumann et al. 2000) described an “anomalous heat flow zone” in central South Australia. This region was not previously delineated by high spatial resolution heat flow data, but the work published here demonstrates that the “zone” described as the South Australian Heat Flow Anomaly (SAHFA; Neumann et al., 2000), is a region where anomalously high heat flow values are interspersed with low values, and there is significant lateral variation in surface heat flow over scales of tens of kilometres. This thesis addresses the following questions: • Is the SAHFA, as shown in Cull (1982) and defined by Neumann et al. (2000), a zone of blanket or even dominant high heat flow? • What is {{the true nature of the}} SAHFA when considered on a 10 km lateral scale? • What are the possible reasons for the surface heat flow pattern in southeastern South Australia? The heat flow field is a fundamental parameter for characterizing the tectonic setting of a geological terrane because the magnitude of surface heat flow, Qs, can have a strong influence on the mechanical or rheological behaviour of crustal rocks. The distribution of Qs is also directly relevant to resource exploration, in that it is related directly to the distribution of heat producing elements (HPEs). These control the prospectivity for high geothermal gradients and geothermal energy, as well as potentially the locations of elevated concentrations of uranium. Closely spaced surface heat flow data clearly highlights the location of the Olympic Dam ore body, and would probably have aided previous explorers in the discovery of Prominent Hill. Surface heat flow mapping in southeastern South Australia revealed a surface heat flow distribution as complex and varied as the geology of the region itself. Two studies in that region demonstrated that, while there is slightly higher than average surface heat flow around some of the volcanic centres in the Newer Volcanics Province, heterogeneous basement heat production is a more likely explanation than remnant magmatic heat for the overall distribution of surface heat flow. A study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the Torrens Hinge Zone in South Australia was likely to be a region of high average geothermal gradients and thus prospective for geothermal energy. A heat <b>flow</b> <b>drilling</b> program designed to test the idea returned results that validated this hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of stars begins with {{collapse of a}} dense interstellar cloud core to a protostar surrounded by an accretion disk. Materials in the core falls inwards to feed further growth of the protostar through the disk. At certain point during the accretion phase, a jet of gas is generated by the forming protostar along the disk 2 ̆ 7 s rotation axis. Subsequently, protostellar jet drives molecular outflow, and which will destroy the core and will terminate the mass accretion. Such evolution of young stellar objects (YSOs) had been classified into three categories, Class I, II, and III, based on the slope of their infrared spectral energy distribution (SED). Recently, the new fourth class "Class 0 " has been suggested for the youngest protostellar objects which have not been detected in the near-infrared and which display an SED with a peak in the submillimeter wavelength. The jet and outflow are an ubiquitous phenomenon in YSOs ranging from "Class O" to "Class I" sources. Despite the substantial observational progress, it is still uncertain when the jets are ejected during the accretion phase because most of Class 0 sources already posses jets and outflows. The Class 0 source, S 106 FIR (d = 600 pc) is a good candidate to investigate star formation process at an extremely early stage before {{formation of}} outflow. This is because this source {{is known to be}} associated with no extensive molecular outflows, making it unique among all 40 known Class 0 sources. First, we conducted aperture synthesis observations of H 20 maser emission at 22 GHz toward S 106 FIR using the Very Large Array (VLA) of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) at 60 mas (milli-arcsecond) resolution on two epochs separated by ～ 3 months. Two compact clusters of the maser spots separated by ～ 50 AU were found {{in the center of the}} submillimeter core of S 106 FIR. The western cluster, which has three maser components, was blueshifted and the eastern cluster, which has a single component, was redshifted with respect to the ambient cloud velocity. Each component was composed of a few spatially localized maser spots and was aligned on a line connecting the two clusters. We found relative proper motions of the components with 〓 30 mas year- 1 along the line. In addition, a series of single-dish observations show that the maser components drifted with an accelerations of ～ 1 km s- 1 year- 1. We conclude that the masers are excited by a 10 AU-scale jetlike accelerating flow ejected from an assumed protostar located between the two clusters. Second, we made the higher resolution observations to reveal the detailed structure of the jetlike flow and to track its motion using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) of the NRAO on four epochs separated by ～ 1 month. The attained angular resolution of ～ 0. 5 mas corresponds to 0. 3 AU. The observations have revealed the presence of a U-shaped distribution of the masers in the western blueshifted cluster, which has a length of 4 AU and a width of 3 AU. Three-dimensional velocity of the U-shape structure was analyzed using the transverse velocities of the masers and line-of-sight velocities. Since the masers are thought to be excited in a "micro bowshock" behind the head of the jetlike <b>flow</b> <b>drilling</b> the ambient cloud medium, we call the jetlike flow as a "micro jet 2 ̆ 7. The U-shaped structure suggests that the micro bowshock does not comprise of interior knots but lies at the head of the Micro jet. The presence of the Micro jet and the absence of extensive molecular outflows together with the cold SED argue that S 106 FIR is an object in the earliest stages of star formation just after the onset of the protostellar jet. In order to investigate the youth of S 106 FIR, we have made deep outflow search by 12 CO (1 - 0) emission using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array (NMA), and by the (3 - 2) and (2 - 1) transitions of the molecule using the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory 10. 4 m telescope. We could not identify any evidence for the presence of the molecular outflow driven by the Micro jet. Our attained 10 σ sensitivities are of orders of 10 - 7 M〓 per km s- 1 for the (1 - 0), (2 -l), and (3 - 2) transitions: these sensitivities would have detected any of the CO outflows associated with Class 0 sources. This negative detection suggest that S 106 FIR is too young to sweep up the ambient cloud medium to form the molecular outflow. We discussed its age to be 〓 0. 5 - 1. 0 x 10 3 years from an upper limit of dynamical time scale of outflow, and from the number ratio of sources without and with outflow in Class 0 sources and the lifetime of "Class 0 ". We conclude from these observations that S 106 FIR has not swept up enough ambient gas to generate a large scale molecular outflow. With the original definition, S 106 FIR is certainly categorized into "Class 0 ". However, S 106 FIR is obviously different from the other Class 0 sources in the sense that it has not yet generated a large scale molecular outflows. This fact might mean that the SED classification scheme is inadequate to describe in detail the evolutionary stages, which might be regulated by jets and outflows. In this sense, S 106 FIR is the prototype of the earliest stage, which is characterized by the lack of an extensive molecular outflow, the presence of a Micro jet and a cold SED. Identifying similar protostars and studying their physical properties will be of great importance towards understanding the evolution from cloud cores to protostars. In addition, the physical properties of the Micro jet itself will help to clarify the acceleration and collimation mechanisms of astrophysical jets. In addition, we conducted a multi-epoch survey of H 20 masers towards 〓 200 known cloud cores and YSOs using the Nobeyama 45 m-telescope and the VLA. The goal of this survey is to establish a general view of the maser emissions associated with low-mass YSOs. We have found that the masers have been detected for 46 ± 8...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a new joining technology, which is used to manufacture high strength hybrid constructions with thermoplastic composites (FRP) and metals, is introduced.
