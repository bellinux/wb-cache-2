40|$|As {{infertility}} {{increases and}} <b>gamete</b> <b>donations</b> decline, an alternate source of sex cells may prove valuable {{for research and}} infertility treatment. This article examines the social and scientific value of gametes derived from the differentia-tion of established human embryonic stem (ES) -cell lines (ES-cell-derived gametes) and customized gametes created using nuclear transfer technologies to contain a haploid set of genes creating children genetically related to parent(s). ES-cell-derived gametes may be valuable {{as a resource for}} biomedical research, instruction and training in assisted reproductive technologies and perhaps for creating children. The creation of children by ES-cell-derived and custom-ized gametes may not result in psychological harm to children but customized gametes may lead to physical harm to children or an accumulation of gene mutations in a population. Although the creation of new types of children using ES-cell gametes provides more reproductive choices to both fertile and infertile individuals, the risk or physical harm to children from customized gametes may be so severe that the scope of reproductive liberty must be limited. Further scientific and ethical analysis of the creation of children by ES-cell gametes is required.

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates interest among some donor-conceived people, donors and recipient parents in having contact. Outcomes of such contact appear largely, but not universally, positive. This paper seeks {{to understand better}} the characteristics of associated support services. Information gathered using the authors' direct experiences and professional and personal networks {{in different parts of}} the world indicates the emergence of four main groupings: (i) publically funded services outside of treatment centers; (ii) services provided by fertility treatment or gamete bank services; (iii) services provided privately by independent psychosocial or legal practitioners; and (4) services organized by offspring and/or recipient parents. Key operational features examined were: (i) who can access such services and when; (ii) what professional standards and funding are in place to provide them; and (iii) how ‘matching’ and contact processes are managed. Differences appear influenced variously by the needs of those directly affected, local policies, national legislation and the interests of the fertility services which recruit gamete donors and/or deliver donor conception treatments. The paper is intended to inform fuller debate about how best to meet the needs of those seeking information and contact, the implications for the way that fertility treatment and <b>gametes</b> <b>donation</b> services are currently provided and future research needs...|$|R

40|$|<b>Gamete</b> and embryo <b>donation,</b> {{although}} technically fairly straightfor-ward, are psychologically, {{emotionally and}} socially complex, having sig-nificant impact on parents and donor offspring. The activity follows a pathway {{that can be}} distinguished in multiple phases, each character-ized by specific choices and dilemmas for which no standard solutions are available (Figure 1). The expectations, beliefs and considerations of parents and offspring, in combination with past and present experi-ence, are crucial for the choices made in each phase. Choices that, often, cannot be reversed once they are made. This underlines the importance of providing good information for participants and all others involved: professionals, policy makers and governments.

40|$|The {{social and}} legal {{acceptability}} of third-party reproduction varies around the world. In Australia, <b>gamete</b> and embryo <b>donation</b> and surrogacy are permitted within {{the regulatory framework}} set out by federal and state governments. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe the social context and regulatory framework for third-party reproduction in Australia. This is a review of current laws and regulations related to third-party reproduction in Australia. Although subtle between-state differences exist, third-party reproduction is by and large a socially acceptable and legally permissible way to form a family throughout Australia. The overarching principles that govern the practice of third-party reproduction are altruism; the right of donor-conceived people to be informed of their biological origins; and the provision of comprehensive counselling about the social, psychological, physical, ethical, financial and legal implications of third-party reproduction to those considering donating or receiving gametes or embryos and entering surrogacy arrangements. These principles ensure that donors are not motivated by financial gain, donor offspring can identify and meet with the person or persons who donated gametes or embryos, and prospective donors and recipients are aware of and have carefully considered the potential consequences of third-party reproduction. Australian state laws and federal guidelines prohibit commercial and anonymous third-party reproduction; mandate counselling of all parties involved in <b>gamete</b> and embryo <b>donation</b> and surrogacy arrangements; and require clinics to keep records with identifying and non-identifying information about the donor/s to allow donor-conceived offspring to trace their biological origins...|$|R

50|$|At {{about the}} same time, clinicians {{reasoned}} that more couples could be helped toward parenthood by substituting donor sperm for men who have no viable sperm, or donor eggs for women who have no viable oocytes - or both.

A careful reading of the 1983 clinical report often cited as the first instance of embryo donation reveals that the donated embryo was actually created for the recipient {{at the same time}} that four embryos were made for the donor couple's own use.

Donors and recipients endorsed a register of nonidentifying information, but were less keen on a register of identifying information. They believed that medical personnel should have access to such registers, and that donors and recipients (but not children) should have access to nonidentifying, but not identifying, information.

40|$|Following {{a recent}} {{decision}} by the human fertilisation and embryology authority (HFEA), British women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment can be ‘paid to share’ their eggs with stem cell researchers. The HFEA and the clinic proposing the scheme present this as a ‘win–win’ arrangement benefiting both infertile women and couples and British science. It is also represented as concurrently both ‘business as usual’ and an exceptional case. Constituting {{a significant departure from}} the previous policy and practice of altruistic donation, the scheme has raised significant concerns among clinicians and activists. Here, we ask what questions feminists can bring to these debates without resorting to a position of either refusal or affirmation. Drawing on diverse materials from public debates, as well as social scientific literature on <b>gamete</b> and embryo <b>donation,</b> we undertake a close analysis of the discursive framing and justification of the proposal.

40|$|Current birth {{registration}} systems fail {{to serve}} adequately {{the interests of}} those born {{as a result of}} <b>gamete</b> and embryo <b>donation</b> and surrogacy. In the UK, changes to the birth registration system have been piecemeal, reactive and situation-specific and no information is recorded about gamete donors. Birth registration has thereby become a statement of legal parentage and citizenship only, without debate as to whether it should serve any wider functions. This sits uneasily with the increasingly accepted human right to know one’s genetic and gestational as well as legal parents, and the duty of the State to facilitate that right. This commentary sets out one possible model for reform to better ensure that those affected become aware of, and/or have access to, knowledge about their origins and that such information is stored and released effectively without compromising individual privacy. Among other features, our proposal links the birth registration system and the information stored in the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority’s Register of Information, although further work than {{we have been able to}} undertake here is necessary to ensure a better fit where cross-border treatment services or informal arrangements have been involved.

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a {{description}} of how authors publishing in medical ethics journals have made use of empirical research data in papers {{on the topic of}} <b>gamete</b> or embryo <b>donation</b> by means of references to studies conducted by others (secondary use). Rather than making a direct contribution to the theoretical methodological literature about the role empirical research data could play or should play in ethics studies, {{the focus is on the}} particular uses of these data and the problems that can be encountered with this use. In the selection of papers examined, apart from being used to describe the context, empirical evidence was mainly used to recount problems that needed solving. Few of the authors looked critically at the quality of the studies they quoted, and several instances were found of empirical data being used poorly or inappropriately. This study provides some initial baseline evidence that shows empirical data, in the form of references to studies, are sometimes being used in inappropriate ways. This suggests that medical ethicists should be more concerned about the quality of the empirical data selected, the appropriateness of the choice for a particular type of data (from a particular type of study) and the correct integration of this evidence in sound argumentation. Given that empirical data can be misused also when merely cited instead of reported, it may be worthwhile to explore good practice requirements for this type of use of empirical data in medical ethics...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether there was {{variation}} in levels of psychological adjustment among children conceived through Assisted Reproductive Technologies using the parents' <b>gametes</b> (homologous), sperm <b>donation,</b> egg donation, embryo donation and surrogacy. Information was provided by parents about the psychological functioning of 769 children aged 5 to 9 years who had been born using ART (from the five groups described). Comparisons were made between the different conception groups, to UK national norms and, for a sub-sample of multiple births, to an age-matched twin sample. No differences were found between the conception groups except that fathers from the egg donation group rated children higher in conduct problems compared to other ART groups. No effects were observed by ART treatment type (ICSI vs. IVF, GIFT and IUI). There was some evidence of lower conduct problems and prosocial behaviour among children conceived through homologous IVF compared to national norms. Taken together, however, consistent differences between groups and in comparison to naturally conceived children were not apparent for mother- or father-rated adjustment problems. Children conceived with assisted reproductive technologies, regardless of whether they are genetically related or unrelated to their parents or born by gestational surrogacy do not differ in their levels of psychological adjustment. Nor do they appear to be at greater risk of psychological adjustment problems in middle childhood compared to naturally conceived children. © 2009 The International Society for the Study of Behavioural Development...|$|R

Inhorn discovered that it is highly prevalent in the Middle East and is probably genetically related to consanguineous (cousin) marriage. Increasingly, Middle Eastern men are viewing male infertility as a medical condition to be overcome through ICSI, and are demonstrating their “emergent masculinities” through their engagements with emerging ARTs.

40|$|ABSTRACT Iran is {{the only}} Islamic country in the Middle East which {{undertakes}} <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> an assisted reproductive technology which has developed in the past 30 years. This study addresses the current situation and future potential of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> in Iran {{in the context of}} the various cultural, legal and religious dilemmas which accompany it. This project utilizes a mixed methods approach, including in-formal group discussion and participant observation. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with practitioners (N= 12) in three fertility centres as well as with the members of the Planning Committee of the Medical Ethics Centre of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) (N= 7). General information about the centres was also collected using a questionnaire (N= 3). The results of the study suggest that the practice of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> can result in bioethical issues in the legal, socio-cultural, political and religious contexts in Iran. The identity of a child resulting from <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> is an important legal issue that overrides other issues such as inheritance. In addition, <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> creates new categories of relatedness involving genetic and social factors that generate socio-cultural complexity and ambiguity. The socio-cultural context in Iran may create specific stigmas and social pressures for the child, donor and recipient. Other issues that might occur include the exploitation of the donor, harassment and blackmail of the recipient, commercialisation of the whole procedure, and incest. In addition, the varieties of fatwas that have been raised in relation to <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> generate an unclear and ambiguous religious situation for patients, donors and physicians. Moreover, the results show a gap between permitting <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> by fatwas and its practice. The lack of specific laws, guidelines, unique codes of practice, and health policies related to <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> not only causes problems related to the practice of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> but also has considerable socio-cultural repercussions in Iran. This thesis also considers how the medical ethics curriculum of Tehran University of Medical Sciences can be adapted and further developed to address the issues raised by the use of this new bio-technology in the Iranian context. Analysis of the current medical ethics curriculum at TUMS, demonstrates that it offers physicians an ethical framework and also provides training related to some of the bioethical issues which are involved in <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> practices, although <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> has not been specifically included in this curriculum. In the absence of this type of medical ethics curriculum, <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> practices continue to be considered in a haphazard and informal way during teaching rounds in the clinical years. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> {{has been known}} as an {{assisted}} reproductive treatment for infertile couples. This method has raised many ethical issues; one of the dilemmas is the payment between the donor and recipient.

"nAfter reviewing the history of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> {{the risks and benefits}} of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> the motivations of donation and the financial incentives were reviewed. Then the ethical debates were discussed; the possibility of undue inducements, coercion and exploitation, the quality of informed consent, commodification of donation, compensating the risks and troubles, the results of not paying the donors and other ethical aspects were also explained. "nPayment is one of the inevitable problems in <b>gamete</b> <b>donation.</b> Considering the scarce supply of gametes compared to its demand, the current policies of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> without any payment leads to increasing numbers of infertile couples and also the longer waiting times for treatment. Moreover, the essential and immediate needs of couples for gamete leads to significant expenditures in illegal outlines. It is necessary to compile an arranged schedule to organize the financial relationship between the donor and recipient in a legal outline...|$|E
40|$|Infertility {{politics}} {{implies a}} role for the state in regulating the relationships between different parties involved in the medicalized process of reproduction, namely would-be-parents (infertile couples or individuals), gamete donors, surrogate mothers, fertility specialists, etc. Policies adopted by the Canadian federal government in 2004 as regards assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) were largely inspired by British regulations. Despite this similar start, Canadian policies never lead to implementation; the province of Quebec rapidly contested the federal Assisted Human Reproduction Act before the courts; and many issues of assisted conception were regulated in a heterogeneous manner by the provinces. Meanwhile in Britain, {{the implementation of the}} policies created many disparities among the regions of the country; the principle of the law was thoroughly contested and scrutinized; and the sites of deliberation were multiple in spite of the existence of a national regulatory agency. First, the author argues that assisted reproduction technologies cannot be taken as one policy domain, but is an umbrella label for a variety of policy issues. In that context, ARTs are unpacked in order to study, at the system level, the practices related to the overcoming of infertility. I focus on three sub-issues: access to fertility treatments, including the question of public funding and access criteria; <b>gamete</b> and embryo <b>donation,</b> including the question of filiation and donor conceived children’s right to know their biological origins; and surrogacy or the enforcement of pre-natal gestational surrogacy arrangements. Second, by mapping the variety of discourses and arenas mobilized by a range of actors, this study shows how framing and reframing dynamics influence public policies and their implementation. Third, by comparing frame mobilization and discursive dynamics between Quebec, Ontario and England this analysis demonstrates how frame alignment can be a necessary condition for a frame to be performative and influence policy outcomes. Depending on the context in which it occurs, frame transformation, amplification, extension or bridging can induce stability or trigger a cascade of events that will lead to policy change or to a change in the implementation of a policy...|$|R

Among the vital interests that critics claim are thwarted by anonymous donation are an interest in having a strong family relationship, health interests, and an interest in forming a healthy identity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Assisted {{reproductive}} technology (ART) {{legislation in}} Sweden {{has undergone a}} gradual transform-ation from being fairly restrictive when first introduced to becoming more permissive in recent years. Regarding <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> Sweden became the first country to pass legislation about disclosure by establishing a child’s right {{to find out the}} identity of the gamete donor once the child has reached maturity. Our aim was to investigate atti-tudes towards <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> among Swedish gynaecologists and obstetricians. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to all gynaecologists and obstetricians listed from a commercial register of all working in Sweden. Among 1230 eligible gynaecologists/obstetricians, 854 (69 %) answered the questionnaire. RESULTS: In general, the majority of Swedish gynaecologists/obstetricians had positive attitudes towards <b>gamete</b> <b>donation.</b> Although a majority advo-cated openness regarding informing the child that he or she was conceived by making use of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> 40 % opposed allowing the child to receive any information about the donor when the child has reached maturity. Even though Swedish legislation has allowed sperm donation to lesbian couples since July 2005, one-third of the gynae-cologists/obstetricians opposed donation to lesbians. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the gynaecologists’/ obstetricians ’ negative attitudes towards disclosure may influence patients ’ ability to discuss their thoughts and feel-ings about donation. This may also {{have a negative impact on}} donor recruitment as well as on the extent of methods made accessible within ART...|$|E

40|$|Background: High quality {{counseling}} {{of potential}} parents {{is needed in}} the process of disclosure to donor offspring, which is important for the child and for family relationships. We performed a search for facts to identify the role of counseling in couples undergoing <b>gamete</b> <b>donation.</b> Methods: We systematically searched Pubmed, EMBASE and Psychinfo. Studies were included if they reported on counseling in <b>gamete</b> <b>donation.</b> Results: A total of 20 studies were included. Twelve studies stated that counselling was offered. The reported studies reflected no consensus about when and how counselling in <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> should be offered and no theoretical background of the disclosure/ secrecy issue. About 50 % of the parents expressed the need for guidance and support of a counsellor. Special concerns were the disclosure issue and the future contact with the donor. Parents did not receive the guidance and support they needed in the disclosure process after treatment. Conclusion: Empirical knowledge on counselling is lacking. This review demonstrates the need to know more precisely at what moments couples should be counselled, and which specific information and guidelines couples need to receive to be more confident in the disclosure process to donor offspring...|$|E
40|$|Medical anthropological {{research}} on science, biotechnology, and religion {{has focused on}} the “local moral worlds ” of men and women as they make difficult decisions regarding their health and the beginnings and endings of human life. This paper focuses on the local moral worlds of infertile Muslims as they attempt to make, in the religiously correct fashion, Muslim babies at in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics in Egypt and Lebanon. As early as 1980, authoritative fatwas issued from Egypt’s famed Al-Azhar University suggested that IVF and similar technologies are permissible {{as long as they do}} not involve any form of third-party donation (of sperm, eggs, embryos, or uteruses). Since the late 1990 s, however, divergences in opinion over third-party <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> have occurred between Sunni and Shi’ite Muslims, with Iran’s leading ayatollah permitting <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> under certain conditions. This Iranian fatwa has had profound implications for the country of Lebanon, where a Shi’ite majority also seeks IVF services. Based on three periods of ethnographic research in Egyptian and Lebanese IVF clinics, this paper explores official and unofficial religious discourses surrounding the practice of IVF and third-party donation in the Muslim world, as well as the gender implications of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> for Muslim marriages...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to examine attitudes towards aspects of donation treatment based on a national Swedish sample of gamete donors and couples undergoing assisted reproductive techniques (ART). The present study was part of the Swedish study on <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> a prospective longitudinal cohort study including all fertility clinics performing <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> in Sweden. The sample comprised 164 oocyte donors, 89 sperm donors, 251 people treated with their own gametes (in vitro fertilisation (IVF)), 213 oocyte recipients and 487 sperm recipients. A study-specific questionnaire was used. Attitudes vary widely between couples using their own gametes for IVF and those receiving or donating oocyte or sperm. The groups differed in their responses to most questions. Oocyte and sperm donors were more likely to agree with the statements "The donor should be informed if the donation results in a child" and "Offspring should receive some information about the donor during mature adolescence" than recipients of donated gametes and couples treated with their own gametes. Donor recipients, IVF couples and donors expressed different attitudes towards openness and information when it came to <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> and those differences seemed to depend on their current reproductive situation.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{investigation}} describes {{features of}} patients undergoing {{in vitro fertilisation}} (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET) where both gametes were obtained from anonymous donors. Methods Gamete unsuitability or loss was confirmed in both members of seven otherwise healthy couples presenting for reproductive endocrinology consultation over a 12 -month interval in Ireland. IVF was undertaken with fresh oocytes provided by anonymous donors in Ukraine; frozen sperm (anonymous donor) was obtained from a licensed tissue establishment. For recipients, saline-enhanced sonography {{was used to assess}} intrauterine contour with endometrial preparation via transdermal estrogen. Results Among commissioning couples, mean&# 177;SD female and male age was 41. 9 &# 177; 3. 7 and 44. 6 &# 177; 3. 5 yrs, respectively. During this period, female age for non dual anonymous <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> IVF patients was 37. 9 &# 177; 3 yrs (p < 0. 001). Infertility duration was &# 8805; 3 yrs for couples enrolling in dual <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> and each had &# 8805; 2 prior failed fertility treatments using native oocytes. All seven recipient couples proceeded to embryo transfer, although one patient had two transfers. Clinical pregnancy was achieved for 5 / 7 (71. 4 %) patients. Non-transferred cryopreserved embryos were available for all seven couples. Conclusions Mean age of females undergoing dual anonymous donor <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> with IVF is significantly higher than the background IVF patient population. Even when neither partner is able to contribute any gametes for IVF, the clinical pregnancy rate per transfer can be satisfactory if both anonymous egg and sperm donation are used concurrently.
