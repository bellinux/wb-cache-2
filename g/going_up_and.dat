500|$|Phillips {{set up the}} {{equipment}} behind his shop in the (12 square feet) middle living room, with a piano and an overturned tin bath in the cellar as a reverb chamber, with a speaker and microphone linked to the studio above. The recordings would normally be on tape, and then transferred to disc, although the tape was recorded over again during the next session. Because of trams, trucks, and horses <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down Kensington, Phillips had to hang heavy blankets over the studio door and a rear window to minimise the noise. Phillips' first recording was of himself singing [...] "Bonnie Marie of Argyle", (unaccompanied) {{and a few days}} later he recorded [...] "Unchained Melody", with local dance band singer Betty Roy. The first disc he cut in the studio was on 7 August 1955, with his eight-year-old daughter, Carol, singing, [...] "Mr Sandman". All the discs had [...] "Play with a light-weight pick-up" [...] on the label, as this would increase the life of the disc, which would eventually wear out.|$|E

In addition, they're {{going to have to look}} at how do they achieve growth at the same time as they're carrying out structural reforms that may take two or three or five years to fully accomplish. So countries like Spain and Italy, for example, have embarked on some smart structural reforms that everybody thinks are necessary—everything from tax collection to labour markets to a whole host of different issues. But they've got to have the time and the space for those steps to succeed. And if they are just cutting and cutting and cutting, and their unemployment rate is <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> up and up, and people are pulling back further from spending money because they're feeling a lot of pressure—ironically, that can actually make it harder for them to carry out some of these reforms over the long term... n addition to sensible ways to deal with debt and government finances, there's a parallel discussion that's taking place among European leaders to figure out how do we also encourage growth and show some flexibility to allow some of these reforms to really take root." ...|$|E

500|$|At 12:30 pm, Bellerophon {{cut through}} the enemy line, {{slipping}} under {{the stern of the}} Spanish 74-gun Monarca and firing two broadsides into her. Moving past the Spanish ship, Bellerophon collided with the French 74-gun Aigle, hitting Aigles port quarter with her starboard bow, and entangling the two ships' yards. Locked together, they exchanged broadsides at close range, with soldiers aboard Aigle sweeping Bellerophons decks with musket fire and grenades. Cumby noticed that the officers were being targeted, and that Cooke's distinctive epaulettes marked him out. Cumby urged him to take them off, only for Cooke to reply [...] "It is too late now to take them off. I see my situation but I will die like a man." [...] Bellerophon was now sustaining fire from Aigle and three other ships, the Spanish San Juan Nepomuceno and Bahama, and the French Swiftsure. Bellerophons main and mizzenmasts were shot away at 1 pm, and at 1:11 pm, Captain Cooke was hit and killed. An eyewitness recorded that He had discharged his pistols very frequently at the enemy, who as often attempted to board, and he had killed a French officer on his own quarterdeck. He was in the act of reloading his pistols... when he received two musket-balls in the breast. He immediately fell, and upon the quartermaster <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> asking him if he should take him down below, his answer was [...] "No, let me lie quietly one minute.

500|$|... "Juxtapozed with U" [...] was {{inspired}} by the Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder track [...] "Ebony and Ivory" [...] as well as the work of Marvin Gaye and Caetano Veloso. The track was originally conceived as a duet, with the band approaching both Brian Harvey from East 17, and Bobby Brown to sing alongside Gruff Rhys. Both turned the band down so Rhys sang the verses through a vocoder to imitate another person, something which he has described as a [...] "very schizophrenic thing to do". Rhys has claimed his lyrics address social injustice and are about [...] "house prices <b>going</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> people being left behind by the super rich". The song has echoes of the Philadelphia soul music of the 1970s as well as David Bowie's [...] "plastic" [...] approximation of the sound on his 1975 album Young Americans. The group tried to make the song as [...] "plastic" [...] as possible: [...] "if we'd tried to make it sound authentic, it would have been awful." [...] According to Rhys the band were keen to challenge people's opinions of them with the track which is a [...] "shocking song, because you can't shock with loud guitars any more" [...] and, as a polished uplifting pop song, is [...] "fairly subversive" [...] when contrasted with the macho guitar music which the band felt was prevalent in 2001. The track was recorded in 2000 at Monnow Valley Studio, Rockfield, Monmouthshire and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} with 1999's Guerrilla, which featured songs with [...] "self-consciously disposable, happy" [...] lyrics, the tracks on Rings Around the World are, according to Rhys, [...] "broodier and more revealing". The track [...] "No Sympathy" [...] was originally written {{for a film}} entitled Plop, which followed three unsympathetic characters who lived for a week {{as though it were}} their last. Rhys has described the song as quite a departure for him as a lyric writer and claimed that out of context it could appear bleak and scary. [...] "Presidential Suite", about former United States and Russian presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, is [...] "a reflective look back at the decadent nineties" [...] during the Lewinsky scandal and asks if [...] "we need to know if he really came inside her mouth?". [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] addresses social injustice and is about [...] "house prices <b>going</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> people being left behind by the super rich" [...] and has been described by Rhys as [...] "grotesque in its upness and lift". [...] "Sidewalk Serfer Girl" [...] was initially written about Patti White Bull, a girl who fell into a coma for 15 years, awaking in 1999, but became an amalgamation of the lyrics of several different songs, including one section in which Rhys describes his disdain for extreme sports. [...] "Receptacle for the Respectable" [...] is about simultaneously being in awe of, and being hurt by, a [...] "girl around town" [...] while [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] is [...] "a romantic song about growing old". [...] "Run! Christian, Run!" [...] was influenced by guitarist Huw Bunford's interest in [...] "doomsday cult websites". Bunford printed out several essays from these websites and gave them to Rhys who used them as inspiration for his lyrics along with his own recollections of watching Christian television shows during the band's American tours. The album's title track, [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World", is based on an idea put forward by Rhy's girlfriend's father and is about [...] "all the rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution, and all the radioactivity that goes around". [...] "Shoot Doris Day" [...] refers to shooting American singer and actress Doris Day with film—"a very cinematic reference" [...] for a song which Rhys claims is [...] "over-the-top lyrically". The track is about [...] "how people change" [...] and also references Labour Party 'spin doctor' Peter Mandelson, in the guise of 'Victor Panache'.|$|E

500|$|Astaire's first {{seduction}} of Rogers in [...] "Isn't This a Lovely Day," [...] falls foul of the mistaken-identity {{theme of}} the plot, so he makes a second attempt, encouraged by Broderick, in the number [...] "Cheek to Cheek". As in [...] "No Strings," [...] the song emerges from Astaire's mid-sentence as he dances with the hesitant Rogers on a crowded floor. Berlin wrote the words and music to this enduring classic in one day, and, at 72 measures, it is the longest song he ever wrote. He was very appreciative of Astaire's treatment of the song: [...] "The melody keeps <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> up. He crept up there. It didn't make a damned bit of difference. He made it." [...] As he navigates through this difficult material, Rogers looks attracted and receptive and, {{at the end of}} the song, they dance cheek to cheek across a bridge to a deserted ballroom area nearby. According to Mueller's analysis, the duet that follows – easily the most famous of all the Astaire-Rogers partnered dances – reflects the complexity of the emotional situation in which the pair find themselves. No longer flirting, as in [...] "Isn't This a Lovely Day?," [...] the pair are now in love. But Rogers feels guilty and deceived and would prefer to avoid Astaire's advances – in effect, fall out of love with him. Therefore, Astaire's purpose here is to make her put aside her misgivings (which are a mystery to him) and surrender completely to him. The choreographic device introduced to reflect the progress of this seduction is the supported backbend, exploiting Rogers' exceptionally flexible back. The main dance begins with the first of two brief passages which reuse the device of sequential imitation introduced in [...] "Isn't This a Lovely Day?". The pair spin and lean, dodging back and forth past each other before moving into a standard ballroom position where the first hints of the supported backbend are introduced. The first backbend occurs at the end of a sequence where Astaire sends Rogers into a spin, collects her upstage and maneuvers her into a linked-arm stroll forward, repeats the spin but this time encircles her while she turns and then takes her in his arms. As the music becomes more energetic, the dancers flow across the floor and Rogers, moving against the music, suddenly falls into a deeper backbend, which is then repeated, only deeper still. The music now transitions to a quiet recapitulation of the main melody during which the pair engage in a muted and tender partnering, and here the second passage involving sequential imitation appears. With the music reaching its grand climax Astaire and Rogers rush toward the camera, then away in a series of bold, dramatic manoeuvers culminating in three ballroom lifts which showcase Rogers' dress before abruptly coming to a halt in a final, deepest backbend, maintained as the music approaches its closing bars. They rise, and after a couple of turns dancing cheek to cheek for the first time since the dance began, come to rest next to a wall. Rogers, having conducted the dance in a state of dreamlike abandon now glances uneasily at Astaire before walking away, as if reminded that their relationship cannot proceed.|$|E
