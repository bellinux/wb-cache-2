5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
25|$|If {{the front}} brake is mounted behind the fork a {{so-called}} self-assisting effect occurs. The <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> between brake shoe and rim creates a bending moment which presses the shoe even stronger {{on the rim}} thus leading to an amplified brake force. Self-assist reduces the input force needed to apply the brake. A disadvantage might be brake fade - a non-linear relation between actuation force and brake force.|$|E

25|$|These instabilities may {{be caused}} by the {{decrease}} of the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> with an increasing velocity of sliding, by material expansion due to heat generation during friction (the thermo-elastic instabilities), or by pure dynamic effects of sliding of two elastic materials (the Adams-Martins instabilities). The latter were originally discovered in 1995 by George G. Adams and João Arménio Correia Martins for smooth surfaces and were later found in periodic rough surfaces. In particular, friction-related dynamical instabilities are thought to be responsible for brake squeal and the 'song' of a glass harp, phenomena which involve stick and slip, modelled as a drop of friction coefficient with velocity.|$|E

500|$|Front {{brakes on}} many {{inexpensive}} bikes are {{not strong enough}} so, on the road, they are the limiting factor. Cheap cantilever brakes, especially with [...] "power modulators", and Raleigh-style side-pull brakes severely restrict the stopping force. In wet conditions they are even less effective. Front wheel slides are more common off-road. Mud, water, and loose stones reduce the friction between the tire and trail, although knobby tires can mitigate this effect by grabbing the surface irregularities. Front wheel slides are also common on corners, whether on road or off. Centripetal acceleration adds to the forces on the tire-ground contact, and when the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> is exceeded the wheel slides.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two main}} {{approaches}} for modeling mechanical systems with unilateral contacts and friction are the regularized and the non-smooth approach. In the following, {{the two approaches}} are introduced using a simple example. Consider a block which can slide or stick on a table, see figure 1a. The motion of the block is described by the equation of motion, whereas the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> is unknown, see figure 1b. In order to obtain the <b>friction</b> <b>force,</b> a separate force law must be specified which links the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> to the associated velocity of the block.|$|E
2500|$|The static <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> must be {{overcome}} by an applied force before an object can move. The maximum possible <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> between two surfaces before sliding begins {{is the product of}} the coefficient of static friction and the normal force: [...] When there is no sliding occurring, the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> can have any value from zero up to [...] Any force smaller than [...] attempting to slide one surface over the other is opposed by a frictional force of equal magnitude and opposite direction. Any force larger than [...] overcomes the force of static friction and causes sliding to occur. The instant sliding occurs, static friction is no longer applicable—the friction between the two surfaces is then called kinetic friction.|$|E
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that there are several cases which are not in {{accordance}} with the general trends. It is caused by the rearrangement of the atoms, and the variation of the structure during the sliding processes will influence the <b>friction</b> <b>forces.</b> In addition, when d[*]≥[*] 2.5 r 0, the ploughing components play the main role in <b>friction</b> <b>forces,</b> while the adhesion component plays the dominant role when d[*]<[*] 2.5 r 0, which may be another factor making the disaccords above. Furthermore, in nanoscale, contact area influences the <b>friction</b> <b>forces</b> significantly, which could be testified by the cases of different spacings and different tip radii.|$|R
30|$|The tip also {{interacts with}} the 3 rd, 4 th, 5 th and 6 th textures during the 1 st sliding for surface III. When the 6 th sliding is finished, a big texture is formed, and the tip takes some atoms to slide on the big texture to show high <b>friction</b> <b>forces</b> for the 7 th and 8 th slidings. From the 9 th sliding, many atoms adhere to the tip, and the {{interactions}} between the tip and the big texture are slight, which induces low average <b>friction</b> <b>forces.</b> During the following slidings, more and more atoms accumulate on the right part of the tip, as shown in Figure  14 (c), and the adhered atoms scratch the big texture to result in high average <b>friction</b> <b>forces</b> during the 14 th sliding. Besides, the scratches make the adhered atoms move to the right part of the tip further, and no stable structure is formed, so the average <b>friction</b> <b>forces</b> fluctuate all the time.|$|R
5000|$|In a slip-critical connection, loads are {{transferred}} from one element to another through <b>friction</b> <b>forces</b> developed between the faying {{surfaces of the}} connection. These <b>friction</b> <b>forces</b> are generated by the extreme tightness of the structural bolts holding the connection together. These bolts, usually tension control bolts or compressible washer tension indicating type bolts, are tensioned to a minimum required amount to generate large enough <b>friction</b> <b>forces</b> between the faying surfaces such that the shear (or tension) load is transferred by the structural members and not by the bolts(in shear) and the connection plates(in bearing). The [...] "turn of the nut" [...] method is also widely used to achieve that state of friction.|$|R
2500|$|A more {{sophisticated}} {{approach is the}} non-smooth approach, which uses set-valued force laws to model mechanical systems with unilateral contacts and friction. Consider again the block which slides or sticks on the table. The associated set-valued friction law of type Sgn is depicted in figure 3. Regarding the sliding case, the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> is given. Regarding the sticking case, the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> is set-valued and determined according to an additional algebraic constraint.|$|E

2500|$|The {{normal force}} {{is defined as}} the net force {{compressing}} two parallel surfaces together; and its direction is perpendicular to the surfaces. In the simple case of a mass resting on a horizontal surface, the only component of the normal force is the force due to gravity, where [...] In this case, the magnitude of the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> is the product of the mass of the object, the acceleration due to gravity, and the coefficient of friction. However, the coefficient of friction is not a function of mass or volume; it depends only on the material. For instance, a large aluminum block has the same coefficient of friction as a small aluminum block. However, the magnitude of the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> itself depends on the normal force, and hence on the mass of the block.|$|E

60|$|In {{the cooling}} of {{celestial}} bodies several factors are concerned. The first and simplest {{is the one}} illustrated at every fire-side by the rapid blackening of little cinders which fall into the ashes, {{in contrast with the}} long-continued redness of big lumps. This factor is the relation between increase of surface and increase of content: surfaces, in similar bodies, increasing as the squares of the dimensions while contents increase as their cubes. Hence, on comparing the Earth with Jupiter, whose diameter is about eleven times that of the Earth, it results that while his surface is 125 times as great, his content is 1390 times as great. Now even (supposing we assume like temperatures and like densities) if the only effect were that through a given area of surface eleven times more matter had to be cooled in the one case than in the other, there would be a vast difference between the times occupied in concentration. But, in virtue of a second factor, the difference would be much greater than that consequent on these geometrical relations. The escape of heat from a cooling mass is effected by conduction, or by convection, or by both. In a solid it is wholly by conduction; in a liquid or gas the chief part is played by convection--by circulating currents which continually transpose the hotter and cooler parts. Now in fluid spheroids--gaseous, or liquid, or mixed--increasing size entails an increasing obstacle to cooling, consequent on the increasing distances to be travelled by the circulating currents. Of course the relation is not a simple one: the velocities of the currents will be unlike. It is manifest, however, that in a sphere of eleven times the diameter, the transit of matter from centre to surface and back from surface to centre, will take a much longer time; even if its movement is unrestrained. But its movement is, in such cases as we are considering, greatly restrained. In a rotating spheroid there come into play retarding forces augmenting with the velocity of rotation. In such a spheroid the respective portions of matter (supposing them equal in their angular velocities round the axis, which they will tend more and more to become as the density increases), must vary in their absolute velocities according to their distances from the axis; and each portion cannot have its distance from the axis changed by circulating currents, which it must continually be, without loss or gain in its quantity of motion: through the medium of fluid <b>friction,</b> <b>force</b> must be expended, now in increasing its motion and now in retarding its motion. Hence, when the larger spheroid has also a higher velocity of rotation, the relative slowness of the circulating currents, and the consequent retardation of cooling, must be much greater than is implied by the extra distances to be travelled.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{the basic}} rule for Coulomb {{friction}} {{is that the}} <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> has magnitude μN in the direction opposite to the direction of slip, where N is the normal force and μ is a constant (the friction coefficient). However, if the slip is zero, the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> can be any force in the correct plane with magnitude smaller {{than or equal to}} μN Thus, writing the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> as a function of position and velocity leads to a set-valued function.|$|E
30|$|In {{the first}} place, it is {{necessary}} to point out that every balanced stationary state of the DS is preceded by its steady sliding motion associated with tripping in or out operation and drilling is accompanied by kinematic friction. As a rule, the coefficients of kinematic friction exceed their magnitudes established in static equilibrium. Besides, usually, the indicated technological procedures happen with certain ultimate longitudinal velocities, while the DS buckling occurs with very small velocities. In this case, the lateral buckling velocities (and the appropriate lateral <b>friction</b> <b>forces)</b> can be assumed to equal zero. Then, all the <b>friction</b> <b>forces</b> are axial and are oriented in one direction. Then, the moving DS experiences action of the more intensive <b>friction</b> <b>forces</b> which have deleterious effects upon the stability of its quasi-static equilibrium. Therefore, at this state, the bifurcational buckling of the DS should first of all be analyzed.|$|R
