[...] Shooting began by March 24, alongside filming of the previous episode and continued through April 4. [...] The flashforwards were written partially to explain what led Jack to become the drug addict {{that he is in}} third-season finale's flashforwards, who believes that his father is alive. [...] Matthew Fox stated that the fourth season is [...] "starting to close the loop on the end of [...] season. [...] Jack in the future is a man marked by weakness, but the Jack [...] is strong. [...] how he made that transition." [...] When asked why Hurley does not take drugs to see Charlie, but Jack starts his drug addiction to try not to see Christian, Edward Kitsis said that [...] "Jack has … always been a man of science, and there has to be something logical. [...] The scene where Jack is staring at the bench where Hurley sits when Charlie visits him, I think in that moment he's thinking, my life right now <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good,</b> I don't want to end up here."

[...] In the flashforwards … there's a sense of purpose to her, there's some clarity to her. [...] There's so much devotion to that child, and she appears to be such a great mother … taking care of Aaron may have helped her put away some other issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a teenager, she {{formed a}} folk rock band named The Breeders with her sister. She {{then became a}} {{prolific}} songwriter, as she {{found it easier to}} write songs than cover them.

[...] The Deals bought microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio. According to Kelley, they [...] "had the whole thing set up by the time we were 17". They later bought a drum machine [...] "so it would feel like we were more in a band".|$|E
2500|$|For the {{coverage}} of the moon landing itself, ITV used computer captions such as [...] "Armstrong taking manual control" [...] and [...] "Touchdown, The Eagle has landed".

Paul Haney described the moonwalk on {{the coverage}} as [...] "the greatest thing to happen since fish crawled up on the beach and survived." [...] On the landing he remarked the landing was only four miles off the point projected [...] "which <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> for Government work".

2500|$|The plot of Mass Effect: Andromeda was {{met with}} a mixed reception.

[...] Andy Hartup of GamesRadar felt that the game lacked the nuance of previous installments, writing, [...] "There’s {{a general lack of}} subtlety and finesse to this game’s storytelling, and much of it feels like it missed the point about what made the original trilogy such a success." [...] IGN remarked that the plot was sometimes derivative of prior games in the series, using the Remnant as an example, which they felt was simply another [...] "long-dead civilization that’s left advanced technology lying around". By contrast, VideoGamer.com listed the game's plot as a positive, likening it to a Hollywood hero story. Reflecting on his experience with the game, Polygons Arthur Gies wrote, [...] "The story in Andromeda <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good,</b> with a number of mysteries on the critical path and some really interesting optional content." ...|$|E
