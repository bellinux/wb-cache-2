If Flook's patent claim can meet {{the definition of a}} [...] "process" [...] under that law then it is patent-eligible (that is, {{it is the kind of}} thing that can receive a patent if it is also novel, unobvious, and the like). The Court decided that the patent claim under review was instead a claim to a [...] "principle" [...] or a [...] "law of nature" [...] and thus not patent-eligible. The Court relied on a line of cases following from the Neilson blast furnace case. The principle of that case, as explained in Oâ€™Reilly v. Morse, is that that patent-eligibility must be analyzed on the basis of it being as if the principle, algorithm, or mathematical formula were already well known (was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prior</b> <b>art).</b> Flook's process is thus ineligible for a patent [...] "because, once that algorithm is assumed to be within the prior art, the application, considered as a whole, contains no patentable invention."

Sys. (1984). The test allowed the rejection of a patent for obviousness only when factual teaching, suggestion or motivation from the prior art show the propriety of the patented combination. [...] Further, the combination of previously known elements can be considered obvious. As the Federal Circuit asserted in Winner Int'l Royalty Corp. v. Wang, there must be a suggestion or teaching <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prior</b> <b>art</b> to combine elements shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prior</b> <b>art</b> in order to find a patent obvious.

Experimental results show that when the number of worker nodes increases from 2 to 4, MDNN can accelerate the DNN computation by 2. 17 - 4. 28. Besides the parallel execution, the performance speedup also partially comes from the reduction of the data delivery time, e. g., 30. 02 % w. r. t. con- ventional 2 D-grids partition.

5000|$|A [...] "novelty search" [...] is a {{prior art}} search {{that is often}} {{conducted}} by patent attorneys, patent agents or professional patent searchers before an inventor files a patent application.

The search may include searching in databases of patents, patent applications and other documents such as utility models and in the scientific literature. Novelty searches {{can also be used to}} help an inventor determine what is unique about his/her invention. Anything not found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prior</b> <b>art</b> can be potentially patentable. Thomas Edison, for example, did not get a patent on the basic concept of the light bulb.

Another key aspect is to convert the nonconvex misalignment estimation to a more tractable problem with a convex objective. We develop a conditional gradient descent method to solve the problem, which performs gradient descent (or conditional gradient descent on the boundary of the search space) and projects out-of-boundary points back into the space. Employing experimentally validated models, we show that our scheme can achieve 92 % of the efficiency of perfectly aligned coils in 90 % of operations, and tolerate correlated distance measurement errors. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>the</b> <b>prior</b> <b>art</b> is susceptible to correlation, undergoing a significant efficiency degradation of 18. 5 %. 14 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|The {{invention}} in {{this case}} was a method of calculating alarm limits by using a [...] "smoothing algorithm" [...] to make the system responsive to trends but not momentary fluctuations in process variables (such as temperature). Because it was conceded that the implementation of the algorithm was conventional, the Court found that the inventor did not even purport to have invented anything on which a patent could be granted. The Court did so {{on the basis of the}} principle that the nonstatutory subject matter (the algorithm) must be regarded as already <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prior</b> <b>art.</b> Therefore, there was nothing left on which a patent could issue. In a case in which a patent was sought on an implementation of a principle (the algorithm), the implementation itself must be inventive for a patent to issue.
