40|$|Identifying the location, size, and {{characteristics}} of small aquifers is becoming increasingly important in Scotland with the growing demand for groundwater to supply isolated rural communities. These small, localized aquifers are found within superficial deposits, such as alluvium, <b>blown</b> <b>sands</b> and raised beach deposits, and in fracture zones in the underlying bedrock. Geophysical techniques offer a rapid and inexpensive method of characterizing these aquifers. Electromagnetic techniques using EM 34 and EM 31 instruments have proved useful in identifying variations in the thickness of superficial deposits and detecting buried channels, for example, at Palnure, SW Scotland. Ground penetrating radar has been used at several locations, including the island of Coll, to detect the boundary between bedrock and alluvium <b>or</b> <b>blown</b> <b>sand.</b> More detailed techniques, such as resistivity soundings, seismic refraction and resistivity tomography {{have been used to}} identify fractures in basement rocks and help calibrate the other methods, for example at Foyers, near Loch Ness. Magnetic profiling has also been used to locate dykes (acting as hydraulic barriers) within Permian aquifers in the west of Scotland. ...|$|R

40|$|In view of {{the actual}} status of coastal dune {{fixation}} in our country, the present paper mainly reports the basic research result through wind tunnel experiment {{for the purpose of}} aiming at rational <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> control. First of all, the actual status of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> damage and its prevention works is introduced, and it is pointed out that to illucidate the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> phenomenon in sandy plain mainly such as artificial sand dune and also the interrelation of said phenomenon with water content of sand surface layer is of utmost importance for <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> control. Secondly, as establishment of measuring method is essential in experimental illudiation of these subjects, the measuring device of water content of sand surface layer utilizing light reflection and the device counting the number of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> using laser were trially produced to make clear the characteristics and the range of application. In dealing with the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> phenomenon, the sand movement in dune sand of wind dry condition as its base and also the relation of the threshold velocity of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> with the grain diameter distribution of sand dune are considered to be unclear in the conventional researches, and therefore the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> quantity formula in consideration of the grain diameter of sand dune was determined through demensional analysis and wind tunnel experiment. From this formula the writer could present the method of objectively judging the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> limit, ascertain its effectiveness, thereby making clear the interrelation between the grain diameter of dune <b>sand</b> and the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> limit. Furthermore, from on-the-spot survey and analysis of the relation of geographical features mainly in artificial sand dune with grain diameter distribution, and also from the wind tunnel experiment between errosion and grain diameter change, it was made clear that wind erosion and coarseness of grain diameter of dune sand are conspicuous in the land behind high artificial sand dune and that the land just behind artificial sand dune becomes the starting point of new <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> toward internal land. As both the sand movement of size-group and the threshold shear velocity of size-group, which are the cause of coarseness of grain diameter, have not been illucidated as to the subject of <b>blown</b> <b>sand,</b> the dimensionless equation for it has been looked for and obtained. In order to clarify the influcence of water content of sand surface layer on the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> quantity and the threshold velocity of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> regarding the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> in the moistured sand surface condition, the influence of water content ratio was grasped as the change of coefficients respectively of the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> quantity equation in wind dry condition and of the dimensionless equation in threshold shear velocity, and its relation with water content ratio was obtained through experiments. The influcence of water content ratio on vertical distribution of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> was also expressed by the relation of dimensionless coefficient with water content ratio, thereby making it clear that the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> quantity, while being uniformed in vertical direction, takes a special reduction configuration in inverse proportion to the increment of water content ratio, which attributes mainly to the saltation of <b>blown</b> <b>sand.</b> The relation of water content ratio with grain diameter of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> was clarified by an index called the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> ratio of size-group in which both the median diameter of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> and the standard deviation tend to get bigger in proportion to water content ratio, and also the sand of larger size-group tends to occupy a large portion of sand composition. Based on the aforementioned respective results, it was discussed as its conclusion that contriving 2 ̆ 2 uniformity of grain diameter and surface uniformity of geographical features 2 ̆ 2 is effective as a conceptive guidance relating to the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> control...|$|R

Particles are points in 3-D or 2-D space that can be represented by a wide variety of station and animated objects such as a ball of light, a video clip, or a selection of text, to name a few. The particles are generated by a particle emitter and can be emitted in small numbers or in the thousands, depending on the project.

Control of the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> {{is important for the}} highway and oil bases there. Comprehensive studies suggest that the effective and feasible measures to control the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> include reed checkboard barriers, upright clustered reed fences, upright reed fences, upright nylon net fences, chemical and clay fixers and artificial vegetation. In practice, based on the type and extent of <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> damages, various control measures are combined to form effective shelter systems. Reed checkboards and fences are the most widely used along the highway because reed is the most easily available material. Nylon net fences are also widely used in places where sand drift is weak to speed up engineering construction. Chemical and clay fixers are useful to consolidate the side slopes of the road but not to be extended on a large scale due to their prohibitive cost. Artificial vegetation, which has provided a pleasing environment, is practiced in Tazhong to control <b>blown</b> <b>sand.</b> Because of their strong dependence on water, vegetative measures can be only recommended in areas where the ground-water is easily available and of reasonably good quality.

The research on <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> movement {{is an important}} component of the controlling <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> hazard. In the present study, we developed a method that based on GIS-based spatial analysis to calculate the <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> movement above the surface of a barchan dune. To do so, we sampled the diameters of sand grains, wind velocity and sand flux above the surface of a barchan dune in Taklimakan Desert. Interpolated the sand grain diameters and wind velocity by means of Kriging and Inverse Distance Weighting, respectively, we got the continuous distribution of sand grain diameters and wind velocity above this dune. Integrated these interpolated results, we computed the aerodynamic roughness length, the friction velocity and the <b>sand</b> flux by <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> models. By this calculation method, the continuous distribution of the aerodynamic roughness length, the friction velocity and the sand flux were obtained. To test this calculation method, we compared these predicted data with the observed values. The tested results showed that the predicted results (the aerodynamic roughness length, the friction velocity and the sand flux) by this method are all satisfied except the sand flux above the dune's foot. We thought that the not enough accurately modeling result of sand flux above the dune's foot is caused by unsaturated sand flux was generated above there, and the models we used are all based the theory of saturated sand flux. Though cans not accurately modeling the sand flux above the dune's foot, this <b>blown</b> <b>sand</b> movement calculation approach is better than those traditional observation methods on the whole...|$|R

40|$|Sand boils, {{which are}} also known as <b>sand</b> <b>blows</b> <b>or</b> <b>sand</b> volcanoes, {{are among the most}} common {{superficial}} effects induced by high-magnitude earthquakes. These generally occur in or close to alluvial plains when a strong earthquake (M > 5) strikes on a lens of saturated and unconsolidated sand deposits that are constrained between silt-clay layers, where the sediments are converted into a fluid suspension. The liquefaction phenomena requires the presence of saturated and uncompacted sand, and a groundwater table near the ground surface. This geological–geomorphological setting is common and widespread for the Po Plain (Italy). The Po Plain (ca. 46, 000 km 2) represents 15 % of the Italian territory. It hosts a population of about 20 million people (mean density of 450 people/km 2) and many infrastructures. Thus, the Po Plain is an area of high vulnerability when considering the liquefaction potential {{in the case of a}} strong earthquake. Despite the potential, such phenomena are rarely observed in northern Italy, because strong earthquakes are not frequent in this region; e. g., historical data report soil liquefaction near Ferrara in 1570 (M 5. 3) and in Argenta 1624 (M 5. 5). In the Emilia quakes of May 20 and 29, 2012, the most widespread coseismic effects were soil liquefaction and ground cracks, which occurred over wide areas in the Provinces of Modena, Ferrara, Bologna, Reggio Emilia and Mantov...|$|R
