Seims This {{thesis is}} an {{assessment}} {{on the effectiveness}} of <b>Dempster-Shafer’s</b> <b>Theory</b> of Evidence in comparison to Classical Probabilistic Combination as it applies to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR). A three feature based classifier (peaks, corners and edges) ATR system is presented. These classifiers are assumed to be independent. The results of both the weight-based Maximum Likelihood and <b>Dempster-Shafer’s</b> <b>Theory</b> of Evidence data fusion techniques are presented. Using Dempster-Shafer an accuracy of 77. 50 percent is obtained, which is less than the 86. 25 percent accuracy of target-specific weight-based Maximum Likelihood[6]. Inagaki’s Unified Combination Rule is implemented as a means to increase SAR ATR accuracy and explore further modifications of Dempster-Shafer. Inagaki’s Unified Combination Rule contains Yager’s and Dempster’s Combination Rules as well as Inagaki’s Extra Rule[17][10]. The maximum accuracy achieved using Inagaki’s Unified Combination Rule was 75. 00 percent. It was concluded that this application lends itself better to classical probabilistic combination. Due to the single sensor (SAR) and the quasi-independence of the three feature based classifiers, <b>Dempster-Shafer’s</b> <b>Theory</b> of Evidence can not be utilized to its full potential. This thesis is a continuation of Hausdorff Probabilistic Feature Analysis in SAR Image Recognition by Chessa Guilas[6]. Thesis research is directed by Dr. John A.

40|$|<b>Dempster-Shafer</b> {{evidence}} <b>theory</b> {{has been}} widely used in various fields of applications. Besides, it has been proven that the quantum theory has powerful capabilities of solving the decision making problems. However, due to the inconsistency of the expression, the classical <b>Dempster-Shafer</b> evidence <b>theory</b> modelled by real numbers can not be integrated directly with the quantum theory modelled by complex numbers. The main contribution {{in this study is}} that, unlike the existing evidence theory, a mass function in the generalized <b>Dempster-Shafer</b> evidence <b>theory</b> is modelled by a complex number, called as a complex mass function. When the complex mass function is degenerated from complex numbers to real numbers, the generalized Dempster's combination rule degenerates to the classical evidence <b>theory.</b> This generalized <b>Dempster-Shafer</b> evidence <b>theory</b> provides a promising way to model and handle more uncertain information.

2500|$|Approaches {{exist that}} allow for {{resolution}} of inconsistent beliefs without violating any of the intuitive logical principles. Most such systems use multi-valued logic with Bayesian inference and the <b>Dempster-Shafer</b> <b>theory,</b> allowing that no non-tautological belief is completely (100%) irrefutable because it must be based upon incomplete, abstracted, interpreted, likely unconfirmed, potentially uninformed, and possibly incorrect knowledge (of course, this very assumption, if non-tautological, entails its own refutability, if by [...] "refutable" [...] we mean [...] "not completely [...] irrefutable").

Unlike other methods, as those given above, classical rough set analysis requires no additional information, external parameters, models, functions, grades or subjective interpretations to determine set membership – instead it only uses the information presented within the given data (Düntsch and Gediga 1995). [...] More recent adaptations of rough set theory, such as dominance-based, decision-theoretic and fuzzy rough sets, have introduced more subjectivity to the analysis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Dempster-Shafer</b> {{evidence}} <b>theory</b> is {{an efficient}} method to process uncertain, incomplete and vague information in data fusion. The combination of conflicting bodies of {{evidence has been}} one of the most important issues in <b>Dempster-Shafer</b> evidence <b>theory</b> since the example of counter-intuitive results produced by Dempster’s rule was found. Based on the framework of the <b>Dempster-Shafer</b> evidence <b>theory,</b> this paper provides a novel approach to handling this problem. The proposed method reapportions the mass in the null set among the other subsets that is originally assigned to the null set. Our simulations show that the proposed conflicting evidence combination method can effectively solve thorny problems such as military target identification of multisensor.
