25|$|Forage fish, {{also called}} prey fish or bait fish, are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed {{near the base}} of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include {{particularly}} fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, <b>shad,</b> <b>hilsa,</b> menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right.|$|R
40|$|The {{migration}} of the Indian <b>Shad,</b> <b>Hilsa</b> ilisha (Hamilton), up the major river systems {{when they are}} in floods is well known. Some time ago, while making observations on the biology and fishery of Hilsa in Bengal and Orissa, a regular small-scale movement of the fish was noticed from the lower reaches of estuaries soon after the peak of winter season, {{even in the absence of}} floods (Jones, 1952). The observations were summarised by the author in the following lines (Jones, 1952, p. 66). " The two periods of {{migration of}} the fish observed during the years under study both in the Chilka Lake and the Hooghly River were correlated with floods during the monsoon rains and to the general rise in temperature of the water in the estuaries after the close of winter. " In the Hooghly, this ascent of the fish takes place usually early in February and is also associated with some breeding activity (Jones and Menon, 1951). During this time Hilsa fishing operations are carried out in the river on a small-scale with the help of the Clapnet, shangla-jal. In the Chilka Lake, in Orissa, a similar migration takes place in January-February when the fish is reported to be caught in the channel area connecting the sea and the lake (Jones and Sujansingani, 1951). It is of interest to mention here that a similar activity has been recorded by Kulkarni (1951) for the Hilsa in the Narbada where there is a small run beginning in March and continuing up to the middle of April. After referring to the early run of Hilsa in the Indus and the Irrawaddy due to floods caused by the melting of snows,, he says that " in the Narbada, however, there is no such possibility, as at no stage the river passes through any snow clad mountains and there is not the slightest increase in the level of water in March and April". In the Indus the Hilsa comes up from the sea by about February and forms a fishery in the river from March to September (Day,, 1873 and Quereshi, 1952). In the rivers of Burma also, it is reported to move up at the close of winter just as in Bengal (Kyaw, 1955) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} management and conservation of ecosystems rely greatly on {{the understanding of}} spatial and temporal distributions of the fish community, ecological variables and fishing activity. The information on landings for all species by commercial fisheries can facilitate analysis of species diversity and distribution patterns. This paper attempts to assess the marine fishery in West Bengal, with emphasis on the diversity with special regard to the variation in quantity of fish caught during different seasons. During this period, a total of 154 different species of fish and shellfishes were landed along the West Bengal coast among which, demersal species were highest in number (65), followed by pelagic species (59). Only two or three groups were dominant in different seasons. During the first (January – March) and fourth (October – December) season, the dominant groups were Bombayduck, croakers and prawns. While, in the third (July – September) season, the dominant species were <b>hilsa</b> <b>shad</b> followed by Bombayduck and croakers. For assessing the diversity of fisheries in West Bengal, Simpson’s index and Shannon’s index were calculated from the season-wise estimated marine fish landings for the period 2007 - 2010. The values of Simpson’s index varied from 0. 06 to 0. 37, the lowest recorded in first season of 2009 and highest in third season of 2007. The highest value was {{mainly because of the}} landings of a single species, the <b>hilsa</b> <b>shad...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{fisheries}} {{sector is}} crucial to the Bangladeshi economy and wellbeing, accounting for 4. 4 % of national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 22. 8 % of agriculture sector production, and supplying ca. 60 % of the national animal protein intake. Fish is vital to the 16 million Bangladeshis living near the coast, a number that has doubled since the 1980 s. Here we develop and apply tools to project the long term productive capacity of Bangladesh marine fisheries under climate and fisheries management scenarios, based on downscaling a global climate model, using associated river flow and nutrient loading estimates, projecting high resolution changes in physical and biochemical ocean properties, and eventually projecting fish production and catch potential under different fishing mortality targets. We place particular interest on <b>Hilsa</b> <b>shad</b> (Tenualosa ilisha), which accounts for ca. 11 % of total catches, and Bombay duck (Harpadon nehereus), a low price fish that is the second highest catch in Bangladesh and is highly consumed by low income communities. It is concluded that the impacts of climate change, under greenhouse emissions scenario A 1 B, are likely to reduce the potential fish production in the Bangladesh Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) by less than 10 %. However, these impacts are larger for the two target species. Under sustainable management practices we expect <b>Hilsa</b> <b>shad</b> catches to show a minor decline in potential catch by 2030 but a significant (25 %) decline by 2060. However, if overexploitation is allowed catches are projected to fall much further, by almost 95 % by 2060, compared to the Business as Usual scenario {{for the start of the}} 21 st century. For Bombay duck, potential catches by 2060 under sustainable scenarios will produce a decline of less than 20 % compared to current catches. The results demonstrate that management can mitigate or exacerbate the effects of climate change on ecosystem productivity...|$|E
40|$|The <b>hilsa</b> <b>shad</b> (Tenualosa ilisha) {{fishery is}} by far the largest single species fishery in Bangladesh. In this paper, a simple bio-economic year-class based model is {{developed}} to describe the fishery and examine its properties. With the help of this model, the optimum sustainable yield of the fishery is calculated and compared to the existing situation. The model is further used to locate socially and economically reasonably dynamic paths from the current situation to the optimal one. The results indicate that the fishing effort (measured in standardized boat units) required maintaining maximum sustainable economic benefits are about one-third of the current fishing effort. At this sustainable fishing effort level, annual net economic benefits from the fishery amount to about US $ 260 million according to my calculations compared to virtually nothing today. The present value of the fishery along a moderate effort adjustment path to this long term equilibrium position is US $ 3, 650 million at 6 % rate of discount. The dynamic path that maximizes the present value of the fishery involves quite dramatic effort reductions for the first two years. Such a path would increase the present value of the fishery by perhaps 8 - 10 %...|$|E
40|$|The <b>hilsa</b> <b>shad,</b> Tenualosa ilisha (Clupeidae, Clupeiformes) is an {{important}} anadromous clupeid species from the Western division of the Indo-Pacific region. It constitutes the largest single fishable species in Bangladesh. Information on genetic variability and population structure {{is very important for}} both management and conservation purposes. Past reports on the population structure of T. ilisha involving morphometric, allozyme and RAPD analyses are contradictory. We examined genetic variability and divergence in two riverine (the Jamuna and the Meghna), two estuarine (Kuakata and Sundarbans) and one marine (Cox's Bazar) populations of T. ilisha by applying PCR-RFLP analysis of the mtDNA D-loop region. The amplified PCR products were restricted with four restriction enzymes namely, XbaI, EcoRI, EcoRV, and HaeIII. High levels of haplotype and gene diversity within and significant differentiations among, populations of T. ilisha were observed in this study. Significant F ST values indicated differentiation among the river, estuary and marine populations. The UPGMA dendrogram based on genetic distance resulted in two major clusters, although, these were subsequently divided into three, corresponding to the riverine, estuarine and marine populations. The study underlines the usefulness of RFLP of mtDNA D-loop region as molecular markers, and detected at least two differentiated populations of T. ilisha in Bangladesh waters...|$|E

Aggregate harvest and effort data was used. Economic parameter on fishing effort, investment and operation cost was gathered as inputs of the model. Sustainable hilsa fishery model was developed indicating unstable and collapse of the fishery at current effort level. Optimal equilibrium model showed effort can be higher than the sustainable fishery but lower the biomass. The most efficient effort control time path to traject the fishery to optimal sustainable yield (OSY) by giving the highest present value was calculated showing that moderate adjustment path is more acceptable. The path shows that present value and the sustainable biomass was reasonable within the 20 year management horizon.
