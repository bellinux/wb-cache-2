By using previously described spleen necrosis virus-based vectors containing multiple markers, recombinant proviruses were studied after a single round of retrovirus replication. The current models of retroviral recombination predict that breaking virion RNA should promote minus-strand recombination (forced copy-choice model), decrease or not affect plus-strand recombination (strand displacement/assimilation model), and shift plus-strand recombination towards the 3 ' {{end of the}} genome. However, we found that while gamma irradiation of virions reduced the amount of recoverable viral RNA, it did not primarily cause breaks. Thus, the frequency of selected recombinants was not significantly altered with greater doses of radiation. In spite of this, the irradiation did decrease the number of recombinants with only one <b>internal</b> <b>template</b> switch. As a result, {{the average number of}} additional <b>internal</b> <b>template</b> switches in the recombinant proviruses increased from 0. 7 to 1. 4 as infectivity decreased to 6 %.

40|$|International audienceKin {{recognition}} {{is a complex}} cognitive process, where an individual should detect a phenotypic cue and compare it to an <b>internal</b> <b>template,</b> which might be genetically determined (i. e., innate or acquired). Kin recognition mechanisms will depend on whether previous encounters with kin are possible or not to form the individual <b>internal</b> <b>template.</b> When relatives have never met before, kin {{recognition is}} supposed to rely on recognition alleles (which allows the innate recognition of relatives bearing them), or on self-referent phenotype matching (the individual has formed a template using its own phenotype and recognizes as kin individuals which match it closely enough). Although self-referent phenotype matching is in theory the more likely explanation, {{it has not been}} possible so far to exclude experimentally the recognition alleles’ hypothesis. Here, we report that kin recognition in the solitary parasitoid larvae of Aleochara bilineata (Coleoptera; Staphylinidae) is suppressed following carbon dioxide anesthesia or chill-coma, both treatments known to cause a temporary amnesia. Treated larvae superparasitize indifferently hosts parasitized either by siblings or by non-kin larvae, while untreated larvae avoid hosts occupied by siblings. The two types of anesthesia thus suppress kin recognition, but their global effect on larvae is different. Chill-coma suppresses the ability to distinguish parasitized from unparasitized hosts and reduces parasitism rate, suggesting an aspecific impairment of sensory receptors or cognition. However, carbon dioxide narcosis only impairs kin recognition, strongly suggesting that an intact memory is necessary for kin recognition to take place. Although this study does not address the recognition alleles’ hypothesis per se, our results strongly support a self-referent phenotype matching mechanism. On the whole, kin recognition in A. bilineata larvae is effective through short-term memory, because it is affected by amnesic treatments...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to foreground removal for CMB maps. Rather than relying on prior knowledge about the foreground components, we first extract the necessary information about them directly from the microwave sky maps by taking differences of temperature maps at different frequencies. These difference maps, which we refer to as <b>internal</b> <b>templates,</b> consist only of linear combinations of Galactic foregrounds and noise, with no CMB component. We obtain the foreground-cleaned maps by fitting these <b>internal</b> <b>templates</b> to, and subsequently subtracting the appropriately scaled contributions of them from, the CMB-dominated channels. The fitting operation is performed in wavelet space, making the analysis feasible at high resolution with only a minor loss of precision. Applying this procedure to the WMAP data, we obtain a power spectrum that matches the spectrum obtained by the WMAP team at the signal-dominated scales. The fact that we obtain basically identical results without using any external templates has considerable relevance for future observations of the CMB polarization, where very {{little is known about the}} Galactic foregrounds. Finally, we have revisited previous claims about a north-south power asymmetry on large angular scales and confirm that these remain unchanged with this completely different approach to foreground separation. This also holds when fitting the foreground contribution independently to the northern and southern hemisphere, indicating that the asymmetry is unlikely to have its origin in different foreground properties of the hemispheres. This conclusion is further strengthened by the lack of any observed frequency dependence...|$|R

40|$|Telomerase is a {{specialized}} reverse transcriptase {{with a built-in}} RNA template. Base pairing between the templating domain of telomerase RNA and a telomeric DNA primer is normally a characteristic of elongation of telomeric DNA. Here we demonstrate the mechanism by which Tetrahymena telomerase bypasses a requirement for template-primer pairing in order to add telomeric DNA de novo to completely non-telomeric DNA primers. We show that this reaction initiates by copying the template residue at the 3 ' boundary of the telomerase RNA template sequence. Unexpectedly, as the RNA template moves through the telomerase catalytic center, the number of required potential Watson-Crick base pairs between RNA template and DNA primer increases from zero to five. We propose that this unprecedented position specificity of a base pairing potential requirement in a polymerase underlies the chromosome healing mechanism of telomerase, and reflects constraints inherent in an <b>internal</b> <b>template...</b>|$|E

Guard workers compare the chemical cues of an incoming individual with their <b>internal</b> <b>template</b> to determine whether the entrant belongs to their colony. In contrast to honeybees, Apis mellifera, stingless bees have singly mated queens and, therefore, are expected to have a higher chemical homogeneity in their colonies. We tested whether aggressive behaviour of Frieseomelitta varia guards towards nestmate and non-nestmate foragers reflects chemical similarities and dissimilarities, respectively, of cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. We also introduced individuals of Lestrimelitta limao, an obligatory robber species, to test the ability of guards to react effectively to intruders from other taxa. We verified that foraging nestmates were almost invariably accepted, while heterospecific and conspecific non-nestmates were rejected at relatively high rates. However, non-nestmate individuals with higher chemical profile similarity were likely to be accepted by guards. We conclude that guards compare the chemical cuticular blend of incoming individuals and make acceptance decisions according to the similarity of the compounds between the colonies.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that we can focally attend to a specific region in visual space without shifting our eyes, so as to extract action-relevant sensory information from covertly attended locations. The underlying mechanisms that determine how fast we engage our attentional spotlight in visual-search scenarios, however, remain controversial. One dominant view advocated by perceptual decision-making models holds that the times taken for focal-attentional selection are mediated by an <b>internal</b> <b>template</b> that biases perceptual coding and selection decisions exclusively through target-defining feature coding. This notion directly predicts that search times remain unaffected whether or not participants can anticipate the upcoming distractor context. Here we tested this hypothesis by employing an illusory-figure localization task that required participants to search for an invariant target amongst a variable distractor context, which gradually changed—either randomly or predictably—as a function of distractor-target similarity. We observed a graded decrease in internal focal-attentional selection times—correlated with external behavioral latencies—for distractor contexts of higher relative to lower similarity to the target. Critically, for low but not intermediate and high distractor-target similarity, these context-driven effects were cortically and behaviorally amplified when participants could reliably predict the type of distractors. This interactive pattern demonstrates that search guidance signals can integrate information about distractor, in addition to target, identities to optimize distractor-target competition for focal-attentional selection...|$|E

Consequently, the v- and cRNA molecules are not perfect mirror images, a situation that is not compatible with conventional strategies to maintain genetic information. We show here that recombinant viruses recovered from cDNA lacking the nontemplated nucleotides efficiently reconstitute the 3 ′ overhangs. Analyses of recombinant viruses encoding genetic markers in potential alternative template sequences demonstrated that the BDV v- and cRNA molecules are extended by a realign-and-elongation process on <b>internal</b> <b>template</b> motifs located in close proximity to the 3 ′ ends of v- and cRNA, respectively.

We found that T. cruzi telomerase is active in extracts from multiple developmental stages of the parasite life cycle. Detailed characterization of the enzymatic properties of telomerase using epimatigote-stage extract revealed a unique combination of substrate specificities, consistent with the evolutionary divergence of trypanosomes from previously established model systems for telomerase biochemical characterization.

At a primer concentration of 2. 5 µM, primers aligned in the beginning, middle and next to the end of the template, respectively, must consist of at least 4, 5 and 6 nt to be extended by the telomerase. At a primer concentration of 50 µM, the corresponding minimal lengths are 3, 4 and 5 nt. The systematic variation of the minimal required primer lengths supports the presence of a site within the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex that mediates specific positioning of 3 ′ termini of telomeric and non-telomeric DNA in the beginning of the template during telomere synthesis...|$|E

The human visual system solves this problem with remarkable efficiency, and one challenge in vision research is to understand how neural rep-resentations of objects are formed and what visual information is used to form these representations. Ideal observer analysis has demonstrated the advantages of studying vision from the perspective of explicit gen-erative models and a specified visual task, which divides the causes of image variations into the separate categories of signal and noise. Classification image techniques estimate the visual information used in a task from the properties of “noise ” images that interact most strongly with the task. Both ideal observer analysis and classification image techniques rely on the assumption of a generative model.

Because image variation in real world object tasks can arise from both geometrical shape and photometric (illumination or material) changes, a realistic image gener-ation process should model geometry as well as intensity.

Remarkably, only a p 82 -enriched subset of the total holoenzyme population is capable of high repeat addition processivity, as shown by p 82 immunodepletion and add-back. The RPA-like p 82 subunit binds sequence specifically to multiple telomeric repeats. These discoveries establish {{the existence of a}} telomerase holoenzyme processivity subunit with sequence-specific DNA binding...|$|R
40|$|Telomerase adds {{telomeric}} repeats to chromosome ends {{using an}} <b>internal</b> RNA <b>template</b> and specialized telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), thereby maintaining genome integrity. Little {{is known about}} the physical relationships among protein and RNA subunits within a biologically functional holoenzyme. Here we describe the architecture of Tetrahymena thermophila telomerase holoenzyme determined by electron microscopy. Six of the 7 proteins and the TERT-binding regions of telomerase RNA (TER) have been localized by affinity labeling. Fitting with high-resolution structures reveals the organization of TERT, TER, and p 65 in the RNP catalytic core. p 50 has an unanticipated role as a hub between the RNP catalytic core, p 75 -p 19 -p 45 subcomplex, and the DNA-binding Teb 1. A complete in vitro holoenzyme reconstitution assigns function to these interactions in processive telomeric repeat synthesis. These studies provide the first view of the extensive network of subunit associations necessary for telomerase holoenzyme assembly and physiological function. Telomerase is a unique endogenous eukaryotic reverse trancriptase (RT) required for maintenance of linear chromosome ends and is a highly regulated determinant of cellula...|$|R
40|$|The {{orienting}} reflex (OR) is {{a fundamental}} biological mechanism thought to reflect automatic adaptive processing of environmental stimuli necessary for successful interaction with the environment. It has been hypothesized that the OR is generated in response to novelty {{such as in the}} case where a mismatch results between an <b>internal</b> neuronal <b>template</b> stored in working memory and incoming stimuli. Recent blood oxygenated level dependant (BOLD) activation studies that have investigated networks involved in the processing of novelty have suggested the recruitment of a distributed limbic-neocortical network. In the present study, event-related functional resonance imaging with simultaneous autonomic electrodermal activity was used to detect single trials of an auditory oddball task associated with the OR. The pattern of activations indicated two distinct, but partially overlapping, networks. Predominantly, frontal activations were seen for the target stimuli that did elicit an OR, including the orbitofrontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus, as well as activations in the anterior thalamus and cerebellum. On contrary, parietal activations including the supramarginal gyrus and precuneus were seen for the target stimuli that that did not elicit an OR...|$|R
