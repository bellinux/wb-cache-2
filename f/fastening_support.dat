40|$|A new rivet {{fastened}} rectangular hollow flange channel beam (RHFCB) {{was proposed}} using an intermittently rivet fastening process {{as an alternative}} to welded beams. The rivet fastened RHFCB allows greater section optimisation and flexibility in designing suitable combinations of web and flange widths and thicknesses for many industrial applications. In the industrial applications of rivet fastened RHFCBs as flooring, roofing or modular building systems, their flanges will be <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports,</b> which will provide increased web crippling capacities. However no research has been conducted to investigate the web crippling capacities of RHFCBs with flanges unfastened and <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports</b> under one-flange load cases. Similarly the current design rules for cold-formed steel sections are not suitable for rivet fastened RHFCBs due to their two hollow flanges. Hence an experimental study was conducted to investigate the web crippling behaviour and capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs based on the new AISI S 909 standard test method. It included rivet fastened RHFCBs with flanges unfastened and <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports</b> under End One Flange (EOF) and Interior One Flange (IOF) load cases. Tests with flanges <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports</b> showed that web crippling capacities increased by 39 and 5 % for EOF and IOF load cases. Comparisons of experimental web crippling capacity results with predictions using the current AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 design standards showed that web crippling design equations are conservative for rivet fastened RHFCBs with flanges unfastened and <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports</b> under EOF and IOF load cases. Hence new equations are proposed to determine the web crippling capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs.

40|$|Thin-walled steel hollow flange channel beams are {{commonly}} used as joists and bearers in various flooring systems in buildings. A new rivet fastened rectangular hollow flange channel beam (RHFCB) was proposed using an intermittently rivet fastening process {{as an alternative to}} welded beams. This flexible fastening process allows RHFCBs to have greater section optimisation, by configuring web and flange widths and thicknesses. In the industrial applications of RHFCBs as flooring, roofing or modular building systems, their flanges will be <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports,</b> which will provide increased capacities. However, no research has been conducted to investigate the web crippling capacities of RHFCBs with flanges <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports</b> under two-flange load cases. Therefore an experimental study was conducted to investigate the web crippling behaviour and capacities of RHFCBs based on the new AISI S 909 standard test method. The web crippling capacities were compared with the predictions from the design equations in AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 to determine their accuracy in predicting the web crippling capacities of RHFCBs. Test results showed that these design equations are considerably conservative for the ETF load case while being unconservative for the ITF load case. New equations are proposed to determine the web crippling capacities of RHFCBs with flanges <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports.</b> Test results showed that web crippling capacities increased by 78 % and 65 % on average for the ETF and ITF load cases when flanges were <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports.</b> This paper presents the details of this web crippling experimental study of RHFCB sections and the results...|$|R
40|$|Thin-walled steel hollow flange channel beams {{known as}} LiteSteel beam (LSB) {{sections}} were developed {{for use as}} joists and bearers in various flooring systems. However, they are subjected to specific buckling and failure modes, one of them being web crippling. Despite considerable research in this area, much of the current design predictions for cold-formed steel sections are not directly applicable to LSBs. This {{is due to the}} geometry of the LSB, which consists of two closed rectangular hollow flanges, and its unique residual stress characteristics and initial geometric imperfections. Hence an experimental study was conducted to investigate the web crippling behaviour and capacities of LSBs with their flanges <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports.</b> Thirty nine web crippling tests were conducted under two flange load cases (End Two Flange (ETF) and Interior Two Flange (ITF)). Test results showed that for ETF load case the web crippling capacities increased by 50 % on average while they increased by 97 % for ITF load case when flanges were <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports.</b> Comparison of the ultimate web crippling capacities from tests showed that AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 web crippling design equations are conservative for LSB sections with flanges <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports</b> under ETF and ITF load cases. Hence new equations were proposed to determine the web crippling capacities of LSBs with flanges <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports.</b> This paper presents the details of the experimental study into the web crippling behaviour of LSB sections with their flanges fastened under ETF and ITF load cases, and the results...|$|R
40|$|Bearing {{failure is}} a form of {{localized}} failure that occurs when thin-walled cold-formed steel sections are subjected to concentrated loads or support reactions. To determine the bearing capacity of cold-formed channel sections, a unified design equation with different bearing coefficients is given in the current North American specification AISI S 100 and the Australian/New Zealand standard AS/NZS 4600. However, coefficients are not available for unlipped channel sections that are normally <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports</b> through their flanges. Eurocode 3 Part 1. 3 includes bearing capacity equations for different load cases, but does not distinguish between <b>fastened</b> and unfastened <b>support</b> conditions. Therefore, an experimental study was conducted to determine the bearing capacities of these sections as used in floor systems. Twenty-eight web bearing tests on unlipped channel sections with restrained flanges were conducted under End One Flange (EOF) and Interior One Flange (IOF) load cases. Using the results from this study, a new equation was proposed within the AISI S 100 and AS/NZS 4600 guidelines to determine the bearing capacities of cold-formed unlipped channels with flanges <b>fastened</b> to <b>supports.</b> A new design rule was also proposed based on the direct strength method...|$|R

Vibrations were measured over four weeks inside the metro tunnel (on the rail, floating slab and tunnel ring wall) and inside a selected sample of buildings.

A systematic approach was applied to identify the {{cases in which the}} vibrations detected inside the buildings could be attributed to metro transits {{with a high degree of}} confidence. This task is critical due to the highly variable soil properties and building structures, and to the presence of diverse vibration sources such as surface transportation and building technical systems.

Finally, the time was noted which the needle required in swinging either {{from right to left}} or left to right: it was equal to seventeen beats of my watch, the latter giving one hundred and fifty in a minute. The object of these preparations was to arrange a voltaic apparatus, which, by immersion in a given acid for a given time, much less than that required by the needle to swing in one direction, should give equal deflection to the instrument with the discharge of ordinary electricity from the battery (363. 364.); and a new part of the zinc wire having been brought into position with the platina, the comparative experiments were made.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{impedance}} {{at the center of}} a patch antenna element is a short circuit, implying that a wire or post can be connected from the patch to the groundplane at this point without impacting radiation performance. In principle, this central post can be used to support the patch element, thus eliminating the need for dielectric. In spaceborne applications, this approach is problematic because a patch element supported by a single, thin post is highly susceptible to acoustic loads during launch. The technology reported here uses a large-diameter center post as its supporting structure. The supporting structure allows for the fabrication of a sufficiently rigid antenna element that can survive launch loads. The post may be either hollow or solid, depending on fabrication approach and/or mass constraints. The patch antenna element and support post are envisioned as being fabricated (milled) from a single piece of aluminum or other metal. Alternately, the patch plate and support column can be fabricated separately and then joined using fasteners, adhesive, or welding. Casting and electroforming are also viable techniques for manufacturing the metal patch part(s). The patch structure is then either bonded or <b>fastened</b> to the <b>supporting</b> groundplane. Arrays of patch elements can be fabricated by attaching several structures to a common groundplane/support structure...|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed steel {{members have}} many {{advantages}} over hot-rolled steel members. However, they {{are susceptible to}} various buckling modes at stresses below the yield stress of the member because of their relatively high width-to-thickness ratio. Web crippling {{is a form of}} localized failure mode that can occur when the members are subjected to transverse high concentrated loadings and/or reactions. The four common loading conditions are the end-one-flange (EOF), interior-one-flange (IOF), end-two-flange (ETF) and interior-two-flange (ITF) loadings. Recently a test method has been proposed by AISI to obtain the web crippling capacities under these four loading conditions. Using this test method 42 tests were conducted in this research to investigate the web crippling behavior and strengths of unlipped channels with stocky webs under ETF and ITF cases. DuraGal sections having a nominal yield stress of 450 MPa were tested with different web slenderness and bearing lengths. The flanges of these channel sections were not <b>fastened</b> to the <b>supports.</b> In this research the suitability of the currently available design rules for unlipped channels subject to web crippling was investigated, and suitable modifications were proposed where necessary.

40|$|The {{intermittently}} rivet fastened Rectangular Hollow Flange Channel Beam (RHFCB) {{is a new}} cold-formed {{hollow section}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} welded hollow flange beams. It is a monosymmetric channel section made by intermittently rivet fastening two torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges to a web plate. This method will allow the development of optimum sections by choosing appropriate combinations of web and flange plate widths and thicknesses. RHFCBs can be commonly used as flexural members in buildings. Many experimental and numerical studies have been carried out in the past to investigate the shear behaviour of lipped channel beams. However, no research has been undertaken on the shear behaviour of rivet fastened RHFCBs. Therefore a detailed experimental study involving 19 shear tests was undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and capacities of rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs. Simply <b>supported</b> test specimens of RHFCB with aspect ratios of 1. 0 and 1. 5 were loaded at mid-span until failure. Comparison of experimental results with corresponding predictions from the current Australian cold-formed steel design rules showed that the current design rules are very conservative for the shear design of rivet fastened RHFCBs. Significant improvements to web shear buckling occurred due to the presence of rectangular hollow flanges while considerable post-buckling strength was also observed. Appropriate improvements have been proposed for the design rules of shear strength of rivet fastened RHFCBs within the Direct Strength Method format.

40|$|The string {{pendulum}} {{consists of}} a mass attached {{to the end of}} an inextensible string which is <b>fastened</b> to a <b>support.</b> Analyzing the dynamics of such forced supports is motivated by understanding the behavior of suspension bridges or of tethered structures during earthquakes. Applying an external forcing to the pendulum's support can cause the pendulum string to go from taut to slack states and vice versa, and is capable of exhibiting interesting periodic or chaotic dynamics. The inextensibility of the string and its capacity to go slack make simulation and analysis of the system complicated. The string pendulum system is thus formulated here as a piecewise-smooth dynamical system using the method of Lagrange multipliers to obtain a system of differential algebraic equations (DAE) for the taut state. In order to find a formulation for the forced string pendulum system, we first turn to similar but simpler pendulum systems, such as the classic rigid pendulum, the elastic spring pendulum and the elastic spring pendulum with piecewise constant stiffness. We perform a perturbation analysis for both the unforced and forced cases of the spring pendulum approximation, which shows that, for large stiffness, this is a reasonable model of the system. We also show that the spring pendulum with piecewise constant stiffness can be a good approximation of the string pendulum, in the limit of a large extension constant and a low compression constant. We indicate the behavior and stability of this simplified model by using numerical computations of the system's Lyapunov exponents. We then provide a comparison of the spring pendulum with piecewise constant stiffness with the formulation of the taut-slack pendulum using the DAE for the taut states and derived switching conditions to the slack states.
