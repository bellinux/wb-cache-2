5|$|Cracks are linear {{openings}} {{that form}} in materials to relieve stress. When an <b>elastic</b> material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks {{meet at a}} node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress {{in the same direction}} would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is <b>elastic</b> or not. In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong <b>elastic</b> fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the force values of different orthodontic latex <b>elastics</b> at different extensions when subjected to testing in dry and wet conditions. This study also aims to determine and compare the force degradation of the <b>elastics</b> produced by four manufacturers at different extensions and at regular intervals. Materials and Methods: 5 / 16 inch lumen medium (Green) and ¼ inch lumen medium <b>elastics</b> (blue) of 4 companies were used. The <b>elastics</b> were stretched on a correx gauge to two times and three times the inner lumen diameter and at a fixed distance of 25 mm (dry test). The <b>elastics</b> were stretched at the specific distances and then immersed in artificial saliva and checked after 24 and 48 h (wet test). The data was analyzed using Student′s t-test. Results: Force degradation increases with time. Force degradation percentage values vary from 5 % to a maximum of 25 %. Conclusions: Thus from the study, the clinician can know the force degradation rates of <b>elastics</b> of two different sizes, manufactured by four different companies. This study also shows that though, the force degradation during the 2 nd day was found to be significant in most of the <b>elastics,</b> it is not sufficient to justify daily change of <b>elastics...</b>|$|R
25|$|A more {{accurate}} approximation of the buckling load {{can be had}} {{by the use of}} the tangent modulus of elasticity, Et, which is less than the <b>elastic</b> modulus, in place of the <b>elastic</b> modulus of elasticity. The tangent is equal to the <b>elastic</b> modulus and then decreases beyond the proportional limit. The tangent modulus is a line drawn tangent to the stress-strain curve at a particular value of strain (in the <b>elastic</b> section of the stress-strain curve, the tangent modulus is equal to the <b>elastic</b> modulus). Plots of the tangent modulus of elasticity for a variety of materials are available in standard references.|$|E
25|$|<b>Elastic</b> modulus {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} ratio of stress to strain within the {{proportional}} limit. Physically, it represents the stiffness of a material within the <b>elastic</b> range when tensile or compressive load are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar deformable properties with the material {{it is going to}} replace. These force-bearing materials require high <b>elastic</b> modulus with low deflection. As the <b>elastic</b> modulus of material increases fracture resistance decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial <b>elastic</b> modulus is similar to bone. This is because if it is more than bone <b>elastic</b> modulus then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. The <b>Elastic</b> modulus of a material is generally calculated by bending test because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or tensile load. However, biomaterials (for bone replacement) are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine the <b>elastic</b> modulus of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of <b>elastic</b> modulus measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.|$|E
25|$|A hyperelastic {{material}} {{is a special}} case of a Cauchy <b>elastic</b> material in which the stress at any point is objective and determined only by {{the current state of}} deformation with respect to an arbitrary reference configuration (for more details on deformation see also the pages Deformation (mechanics) and Finite strain). However, the work done by the stresses may depend on the path the deformation takes. Therefore, a Cauchy <b>elastic</b> material has a non-conservative structure, and the stress cannot be derived from a scalar <b>elastic</b> potential function. The special case of Cauchy <b>elastic</b> materials where the work done by the stresses is independent of the path of deformation is referred to as a Green <b>elastic</b> or hyperelastic material. Such materials are conservative and the stresses in the material can be derived by a scalar <b>elastic</b> potential, more commonly known as the Strain energy density function.|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{test the}} null {{hypothesis}} {{that there is no}} difference between latex and nonlatex orthodontic <b>elastics</b> with respect to tissue compatibility and surface structure. Materials and methods: latex and nonlatex <b>elastics</b> were implanted in the subcutaneous connective tissue of 45 Wistar rats. In the control groups, no material was implanted (sham). After 24 hours, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days, the animals were euthanized; tissue samples were processed and analyzed by descriptive and semi-quantitative microscopic analysis and quantification of plasma extravasation. The surface structure of <b>elastics</b> was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey test and Kruskal-Wallis test at 5 % significance level. Results: peri-implant plasma extravasation was significantly higher (P. 05) between the experimental and control groups. The SEM analysis revealed that the latex <b>elastics</b> presented microspheres and porosities, while the nonlatex <b>elastics</b> exhibited crystals on their surface and absence of porosities. Conclusion: the null hypothesis was rejected since the latex <b>elastics</b> were more irritating to the connective tissue than the nonlatex <b>elastics</b> in the initial periods and presented a more porous surface...|$|R

Zimmer et al.

The patients included in this study had growth potential, so the change of OP inclination is naturally growth-related changes, and the use of class II <b>elastics</b> completely eliminate typical growth-induced decreases in inclination [19]. But in contrast to Zimmer’s report, in the class III group, the BOP inclination change after treatment was not statistically significant in our study.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Natural latex {{does not}} fall into the {{category}} of materials known to be entirely inoffensive. The purpose of this in vitro study was to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in the cytotoxicity between <b>elastics</b> of different colors and those from different manufacturers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Different latex intraoral <b>elastics</b> of different colors (5 / 16 = 7. 9 mm, mean load) were compared. The sample was divided into 7 groups of 24 <b>elastics</b> each: Group T (TP Orthodontics, natural latex <b>elastics,</b> control); Groups U 1, U 2, U 3, U 4, U 5 and U 6 (Uniden, natural latex <b>elastics</b> and colored <b>elastics,</b> namely, green, pink, yellow, red and purple, respectively). Cytotoxicity assays were performed by using cell culture medium containing epithelioid-type cells (Hep- 2 line) derived from human laryngeal carcinoma. The cytotoxicity was evaluated by using the "dye-uptake" test, which was employed at two different moments (0 and 24 h). Data were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: There was statistically significant difference (p< 0. 05) between Group T and all other groups (U 1, U 2, U 3, U 4, U 5 and U 6) at 0 and 24 h. No statistically significant difference (p< 0. 05) was found between Groups U 1 and U 5, U 1 and U 6, U 2 and U 3, U 2 and U 4, U 2 and U 5, U 2 and U 6, U 3 and U 4, U 3 and U 5, U 3 and U 6, U 4 and U 5, U 4 and U 6, and U 5 and U 6 at 0 and 24 h.
