500|$|Before departing Fortuna, Dante surprises Nero by {{deciding}} to entrust him with Yamato indefinitely; thus recognizing {{him as a}} part of his family. The two part as equals. In a way, this also symbolizes Dante letting go of the past, and allowing himself to move on from his brother Vergil's death. Left in the ruins of Fortuna, Nero easily fights off the last remaining demons, before finally sharing his first kiss with Kyrie. In the extra Special Edition story for Trish and Lady, both appear (somewhat non-canonically for Lady) and witness the kiss from afar with Dante, only for Trish to lament that [...] "at least someone <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the girl." ...|$|E

Bower also added that Natasha and Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) clash because Summer is a feminist who fights for causes, while Natasha is the opposite.

Memer believes {{she is the only}} who <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in, until she finds the Waylord there when she is nine years old.

500|$|The Birmingham News Mary Colurso complemented Mars' capicity to {{demonstrate}} [...] "major charisma", his vocals, the band who backed {{him up and}} the dynamic atmosphere in the arena. Colurso commented that Mars might not have the most deep and breathtaking music, [...] "but he certainly <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the party started." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post {{said that it was}} a [...] "one of those rare, thrilling, upside-down pop concerts", because Mars did not try to recreate the gleam of his most successful tracks, instead he reshaped the songbook at his will, which Richards found amazing. The reviewer also mentioned the wide ranges of genres that Mars approached, including [...] "Motown, new wave, late-’70s funk, mid-’90s R" [...] influenced by pop, which earned him various generations of admirers and fans. However, he criticized the singer for not claiming his own personality through all the [...] "genre-jumping time travel" [...] and for not adding the band name, The Hooligans, on the ticket, as well. Jim Farber from the New York Daily News praised the concert as it tried to recreate the 70's era regarding its entertainment. The reviewer compared it to some acts of that period such as The Jacksons, The Tramps and The Bee Gees. He enlightened Mars' voice matching its [...] "purity, cream and range" [...] to the [...] "mid-period Michael Jackson". Farber compared Mars and Jackson as both of them are [...] "pure entertainers". He pointed, [...] "it hardly seemed to matter that the show wasn’t big on risk or depth." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Madonna has been {{involved}} in writing and producing most of her own music. Stuart Price, who worked on Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), said that [...] "You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her. She's a really good producer herself and obviously a great writer too. She has her vision and <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it." [...] Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: [...] "I don't know where [...] came from. It was like magic. I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'." [...] Madonna later became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album, including [...] "Lucky Star" [...] which she composed on synthesizer. Rolling Stone has named her [...] "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics." [...] According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing [...] "incredible" [...] hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and its line [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine." [...] Though Madonna has worked with producers across many genres, her songs have been consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail. Some of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which led to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times, for 2014, 2016 and 2017 ceremony. Rolling Stone listed Madonna at number 56 on the [...] "100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time".|$|E
