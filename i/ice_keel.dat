It is easy to implement {{and can be used}} for two-thickness and multithickness category models. Two free parameters are used to determine the critical thickness required for large <b>ice</b> <b>keels</b> to reach the bottom and to calculate the basal stress associated with the weight of the ridge above hydrostatic balance.

The simulated landfast ice areas for regions off the coast of Siberia and for the Beaufort Sea were calculated and compared with data from the National Ice Center. With optimal parameters, the basal stress parameterization leads to a slightly shorter landfast ice season but overall provides a realistic seasonal cycle of the landfast ice area in the East Siberian, Laptev and Beaufort Seas.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{reliably}} predict ice forces generated by ridged ice features {{is very important}} for the design of offshore structures in many cold regions. Analytical models have been developed for predicting the loads on a structure due to interaction of an ice ridge keel or rubble, but few data exist for validating these models. In the present paper, the <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> load distribution across the face of a vertical cylindrical structure is assessed. Ice load data collected in 2002 as part of the STRICE project at Norstr 6 msgrund lighthouse were examined. Events for which the instrumented part of the lighthouse was responding only to <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> loading were analysed to quantify horizontal <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> pressures. The results have been compared with predictions of a numerical model. Numerical modeling is also used to predict the global ice forces and ice failure behavior for ridges of different size. From both full scale field data and numerical simulations of ridge interaction with the lighthouse, a trend of higher forces with increasing keel depths can be seen. In addition to generating larger global loads, larger ridges appear to create greater local loads around the waterline of the cylindrical structure. The load distribution across the lighthouse is not uniform. For some events, the forces on the load panels show a parabolic-type distribution while for others a different load distribution with two maxima is seen. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

This thesis focuses on the subgouge deformations of the ice gouging process. The relationships between gouge depth, frontal berm, force, pressure, subgouge deformation and vertical extent of subgouge deformation {{are discussed in the}} thesis. The PIRAM tests were compared with the results of a similar series of previously conducted tests, and previous tests. Significance of the frontal berm height, gouge depth, gouge rate are also discussed. [...] The experimental program consisted of towing a model <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> across a model testbed at a set gouge depth under various centrifuge acceleration. The test setup consisted of an aluminum half width <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> model mounted on a gantry situated on top of the containment box given the centerline of the model was replaced by a viewing window to visualize the subgouge deformation accumulation. The model tests were conducted using saturated fine sand simulating seabed. Two tests were conducted with shallow gouge depths for comparison with previous Delft Hydraulics flume medium scale gouge tests to evaluate the applicability of centrifuge modeling. Three tests were conducted at a fast gouge rate since most of the previous work were conducted at a relatively slow rate. A large amount of data regarding <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> gouge in sand was acquired from the experimental program the analysis of which described here in. [...] The combined depth of gouge depth and frontal berm height has a significant effect on the force and subgouge deformation. The force per unit width increases as the gouge depth increases. The vertical to lateral gouge force ratio seems to be independent of the aspect ratio which is gouge width divide gouge depth or attack angle. The kappa value is the frontal berm height normalized by gouge depth is linear with the aspect ratio. The kappa value has a significant effect on gouge force and subgouge deformation. Particle image velocimetry (PlV) technique was successfully used to track the evolution of subgouge deformation in all 7 tests. The maximum horizontal subgouge displacement occurred {{at the base of the}} keel and decreased with depth. The associated maximum gouge forces are a function of the keel attack angle and the gouge geometry. In comparison with previous tests, the vertical extent of subgouge deformation (SGD) was a function of combined depth and the soil state, but independent of the attack angle. The SGD are influenced by the attack angle and the soil state.

Trenching is also used to protect pipelines from gouging by <b>ice</b> <b>keels.</b> In both cases, planning of the pipeline involves geotechnical considerations. Pipelines resting on the seabed require geotechnical data along the proposed pipeline route to evaluate potential stability issues, such as passive failure of the soil below it (the pipeline drops) due to insufficient bearing capacity, or sliding failure (the pipeline shift sideways), due to low sliding resistance. The process of trenching, when required, needs to take into account soil properties and how they would affect ploughing duration. Buckling potential induced by the axial and transverse response of the buried pipeline during its operational lifespan need to be assessed at the planning phase, and this will depend on the resistance of the enclosing soil.|$|R
40|$|Many {{engineering}} {{challenges are}} currently {{posed by the}} Arctic and the sea ice found there. <b>Ice</b> ridge <b>keels</b> have attracted significant attention {{because of the potential}} damage they can inflict on subsea installations. The formation of seabed gouges in the winter has been documented. It has been hypothesised that moving <b>ice</b> ridge <b>keels</b> can gouge seabeds. Pipelines, power and communication cables and other subsea structures can also be affected by ridge keels. In industry, the aforementioned structures are typically protected from the effects of ridge keels by burial into the seabed soil. This method is enormously expensive for linear structures such as pipelines and cables. The deeper the burial into the soil, the higher is the cost. Thus, the salient issue in industry is {{to strike a balance between}} safety and profit. This issue is obviously very complicated and has been the subject of interdisciplinary research by the international community, which has resulted in the formulation of international standards. In this thesis, we focused on the physical and mechanical properties of ridge keels and the processes which can provide sufficient strength for keels to interact with the seabed and potential structures. Keels can be considerably strengthened through consolidation. Atmospheric cooling during the winter season causes a consolidated layer to form in the keel. In this work, we concluded that there are different physical processes for the thermodynamic consolidation of keels in the spring and summer seasons. The thermodynamic consolidation of <b>ice</b> ridge <b>keels</b> in water at varying freezing points is a significant research topic in this thesis. This research is classified into four main areas, as given below.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>ice</b> <b>keels</b> {{on the upper}} ocean are {{examined}} {{using a combination of}} turbulence measurements and output from a large-eddy simulation (LES) model. Two cases are examined, one during the winter when the under-ice boundary layer is relatively deep (20 m) and near the freezing point and a second during the summer when the ice is melting and the boundary layer consists of a shallow (0. 5 m), highly stratified fresh layer. In the winter case, measurements show that flow disruption by a 10 -m-deep keel causes enhanced vertical mixing, increasing the heat flux from a background value of 5 W m^(- 2) to values averaging 25 W m^(- 2). Simulations using the LES model are in good agreement with the measurements and indicate that the keel generates a turbulent wake region extending hundreds of meters downstream from the keel. Elevated heat fluxes in the wake region are generated by increased entrainment of warmer water from beneath the mixed layer. Simulations of summer cases demonstrate that shallow keels (0. 5 m) generate strong turbulence that is able to rapidly mix the fresh layer in the lee of keels. However, this effect decreases quickly as the fresh layer accelerates to match the <b>ice</b> velocity. Deeper <b>keels</b> (1 m) follow a similar pattern but generate more mixing as the fresh layer is forced under the <b>keel.</b> Simulated <b>ice</b> melt heat fluxes are similar to estimates made from ice balance measurements taken during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean summer field program...|$|R

40|$|Ice scour is the {{phenomenon}} {{that occurs when}} the keel of a floating mass of ice (iceberg, sea ice or freshwater ice) touches, penetrates and continues to move forward through unlithified seabed or lakebed sediments. The typically curvilinear excavation made by the scouring keel is called a scour mark. Scouring ice keels present logistical problems to the safe installation and operation of, for example, {{oil and gas production}} pipelines and power and telecommunication cables in several cold ocean regions. The typical surface morphologies of modern iceberg scour marks on the Labrador continental shelf are described, and mechanisms that operate at or near the sediment surface during the period of ice/seabed interaction are suggested. Scouring action also disturbs sediments beneath the seabed or lakebed. Sub-scour deformation is accommodated by compression and pore space-reduction beneath the scour mark, by corresponding volume increase adjacent to the trough and by folding and faulting. Deformation structures are described from beneath ancient large scale (30 - 40 m-wide) iceberg scour marks exposed in clays of the former glacial Lake Agassiz in southern Manitoba, and from small scale (< 5 m wide) contemporary scour marks that form on tidal flat sediments in Cobequid Bay, Nova Scotia, and the St. Lawrence estuary, Quebec. Structural data from the Lake Agassiz features are presented and discussed with respect to scour mark-forming mechanisms. Criteria for the recognition of ice scour marks and of <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> turbates are developed.

Measurements took place in March 2007 in the Beaufort Sea at the Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station sponsored by the U. S. Navy. Turbulence measurements were made at a single point behind a large multi-year ice ridge in the upper ocean boundary layer. The keel {{was found to be}} at least 12. 5 m deep and much broader than expected. Ocean profiles showed the pycnocline between 13 - 18 m deep and thus a unique situation of measuring the flow around a large ice structure in a shallow boundary layer presented itself. Results indicate that estimates of turbulence intensity depend on ice speed, direction and measurement depth. Velocity spectra indicate periods of low inertial subrange levels likely resulting from close proximity to the pycnocline. Low frequency variance in the velocity spectra was also observed and is thought to be a wake effect resulting from an under ice structure upstream of the flow. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
40|$|Macro- and micro-scale sedimentological {{analyses}} of recently deposited tills and complex push/squeeze moraines on the forelands of Icelandic glaciers {{and in a}} stacked till sequence at the former Younger Dryas margin of the Loch Lomond glacier lobe in Scotland are {{used to assess the}} depositional processes involved in glacier submarginal emplacement of sediment. Where subglacial meltwater is unable to flush out subglacial sediment or construct thick debris-rich basal ice by cumulative freeze-on processes, glacier submarginal processes are dictated by seasonal cycles of refreezing and melt-out of tills advected from up-ice by a combination of lodgement, deformation and <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> and clast ploughing. Although individual till layers may display typical A and B horizon deformation characteristics, the spatially and temporally variable mosaic of subglacial processes will overprint sedimentary and structural signatures on till sequences {{to the extent that they}} would be almost impossible to classify genetically in the ancient sediment record. At the macro-scale, Icelandic tills display moderately strong clast fabrics that conform to the ice flow directions documented by surface flutings; very strong fabrics typify unequivocally lodged clasts. Despite previous interpretations of these tills as subglacial deforming layers, micro-morphological analysis reveals that shearing played only a partial role in the emplacement of till matrixes, and water escape and sediment flowage features are widespread. A model of submarginal incremental thickening is presented as an explanation of these data, involving till slab emplacement over several seasonal cycles. Each cycle involves: (1) late summer subglacial lodgement, bedrock and sediment plucking, subglacial deformation and <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> ploughing; (2) early winter freeze-on of subglacial sediment to the thin outer snout; (3) late winter readvance and failure along a decollement plane within the till, resulting in the carriage of till onto the proximal side of the previous year's push moraine; (4) early summer melt-out of the till slab, initiating porewater migration, water escape and sediment flow and extrusion.

As sea-ice continues to decline, marine traffic will increase and the United States will require a more active {{military presence in the}} Arctic. Future Arctic conditions must be forecasted with increased accuracy to allow for proper planning with regard to the nations changing role in the region. It is the goal of this thesis to contribute to the knowledge of turbulence and mixing associated with ice keels in the Arctic Ocean in order to improve the accuracy of predictive coupled ocean/ice/atmospheric models. At Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station 2011, a 3 -dimensional (3 -D) sonar was used to record high resolution morphological measurements of an <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> approximately 33 m long by 29 m across and 10 m deep. Sensors were deployed in the water column approximately 10 m from the keel to record water properties of salinity, temperature, and 3 -D velocity at selected depths in the upper water column. These observations were used to make calculations of turbulence within the mixed layer, in order to gain a greater understanding of how keels affect turbulent drag and heat fluxes in the upper ocean. Results indicate that keels generate significant turbulence and mixing in the upper ocean, even during benign weather conditions in which there is little surface forcing. Keels increase the kinetic energy of the upper ocean through production of turbulent eddies during times of weak stratification and the generation of internal waves during times of strong stratification. Keel-induced turbulence and mixing may lead to entrainment of warmer water underlying the surface mixed layer that could be a contributor to ice melting. Calculation of the quadratic drag coefficient Cw also indicated that Cw varies greatly with water column stratification and ice undersurface roughness. Values as high as 0. 08 were seen {{in the wake of a}} 10 m <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> during strong stratification, and as low as 0. 002 when the current was not affected by the keel during weak stratification.

This is important for the design of subsea structures in shallow waters, where ice keels have been observed to scour the sea floor, posing a threat to pipelines and subsea infrastructure. A series of near full-scale keel-gouge tests were carried out to investigate the strength characteristics of a first-year <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> and its subsequent failure as it was pushed into an artificial seabed. The ice keels were constructed using freshwater ice blocks with a nominal thickness of 10 cm, produced in a cold storage facility {{prior to the start of}} the test program. The ice keels were constructed with the aid of a keel former that produced idealized keel geometries of 1. 7 m depth, 4 m length and 3. 5 m width. Once constructed, the keels were lowered into the water and left overnight to consolidate with air temperatures held at - 200 C. The keel samples were tested using a custom-built frame that was designed and used in the Pipeline Ice Risk Assessment and Mitigation (PIRAM) Joint Industry Project. The frame applied a vertical surcharge load to the top of the keel whilst a soil tray was displaced horizontally, causing the bottom of the <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> to interact with an artificial seabed.

Additional tests were performed to characterise the mechanical properties of the model <b>ice</b> <b>keels,</b> including punch tests, retaining wall tests, oedometer tests and piling tests. Small-scale laboratory work was performed in the cold laboratory at NTNU to investigate freeze-bond effects on the resistance of first-year ice ridges and their deformation process. The rubble was composed of saline ice blocks at - 7 °C, and freeze-bonds of three different strengths were created between the blocks by submerging them for 0 min, 10 min or 20 h. Fourteen shear box tests with three different vertical confinements were analysed. The punch tests and interaction tests were modelled in three dimensions using Abaqus V 8. 2 with the nonlinear Eulerian finite element method. The rubble's behaviour was described with the Drucker-Prager material model. The following points were highlighted {{in the analysis of}} the experiments: • The horizontal loads on the subsea structures reached a steady state of progressive local failure correlated with the keel profiles. • The time series from the retaining wall tests showed that the plate load was correlated with the penetration speed, and a wedge extrusion was observed. • The oedometer test showed behaviour typical of a loose soil. The Young modulus was measured at 0. 9 MPa, and the hydrostatic compressive yield curve was determined. • The finite element analysis of the punch tests showed that: A cohesive softening occurred in the rubble. It was assumed that the cohesion decreased linearly from its initial (peak) value to 0 over the first 2 % of plastic strain. For the short-submersion-time ridges, it was necessary to use a vertical distribution of the cohesion representing the vertical distribution of the freeze-bond strength. The cohesion was distributed linearly in the keel, from 0 Pa to 1. 2 kPa at the keel top. In the long-submersion-time tests, the cohesion was uniformly distributed in the keel and its value did not exceed 0. 5 kPa. The ice density and the keel depth were the main parameters governing the frictional resistance of the keel. Because of the low confinement at the rubble failure planes, the importance of the friction angle was reduced; therefore, this test is not the most appropriate for determining this angle. • In the pile tests, the critical angle was higher than the repose angle, indicating that cohesion can develop {{in a short period of}} time (less than 5 min). The friction angle was estimated to be between 30 º and 45 °. • The shear box experiments at NTNU showed that rubble failure was initiated by the breaking of freeze-bonds. The analyses revealed that increased freeze-bond strength contributed to: o Higher rubble shear resistance in the primary failure mode. o Higher strain localisation and dilatation under low confinement deformations. Finite element simulations of the model <b>ice</b> ridge <b>keel</b> interactions with the structures were performed using the material model and mechanical parameters determined from mechanical tests: • The numerical models were able to estimate the keel load and its deformed shape. • A progressive failure of the keel occurred, which agreed with observations reported from small- and medium-scale physical tests. The action of the model <b>ice</b> ridge <b>keels</b> on the cone was computed by analytical and numerical methods. The analytical method involved keel load calculations using the recommendations given in ISO/FDIS 19906 with minor modifications to account for the geometry of the structure. The following conclusions were drawn: • ISO recommendations are insufficient and potentially underconservative with respect to the calculation of loads from wide ridge keels on simple conical structures (at model scale). • It is necessary to consider the surcharge due to rubble accumulation. • Numerical methods can be used to better understand the behaviour of unconsolidated ridge keels and to calibrate analytical models.

40|$|A {{survey of}} nearshore {{areas in the}} Vestfold Hills, Antarctica, using {{high-resolution}} multibeam swath bathymetry provided both a detailed digital bathymetric model and information on sediment acoustic backscatter. Combined with underwater video transects and sediment sampling, these data were used to identify and map geomorphic units. Six geomorphic units identified in the survey region include: rocky outcrops, basins, pediments, valleys, scarps and embayments. In addition to geomorphic units, the data revealed sedimentary features that provide insights into post-glacial sediment transport and erosion in the area. <b>Ice</b> <b>keel</b> pits and scours are common, and sea floor channels, scour depressions and sand ribbons indicate transport and deposition by wind-driven currents and oceanographic circulation. Gullies and sediment lobes observed on steep slopes indicate mass movement of sediment. Some of these processes have not been directly observed to date, but their effectiveness in shaping the modern sea floor is clearly indicated by the sea floor mapping data. The embayments preserve a mantle of boulder sand probably deposited by cold-based glaciers which were flanked by faster-flowing ice in adjoining regions. 21 page(s...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Oil and gas {{produced}} in the Arctic seas is transported by offshore buried pipes. In some areas, however, the estimation of a safe burial depth is hampered by the possibility that ice masses can make trenches in the sea floor and damage the pipe, this process is known as “ice scouring”. In {{order to make a}} safe design, knowledge is required of the soil deformation under an <b>ice</b> <b>keel</b> scouring the soil. Since it is difficult to examine ice scouring in a field test, tests have been carried out in the geotechnical centrifuge of the University of Delft. Several parameters were varied, such as speed, undrained shear strength, scour depth and multiple scouring. A grid was placed on the clay sample so that the complex deformation pattern could be visualized clearly. The soil deformation was measured by means of image processing and the horizontal and vertical loads were measured. The tests have shown interesting relationships between these parameters and the subgouge deformation. Under some circumstances, shear bands and deep cracks could be observed. The test results indicate that the depth of subgouge deformation can be estimated by the undrained shear strength of the soil. ...|$|E
40|$|Ice gouge {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} by numerous authors since the early 1970 s. A common theme in nearly all experiments {{is the use of}} an idealized prismatic wedge shape model to represent the keel of an iceberg or pressure ridge. In the case of icebergs, {{it is well known that}} keel morphology is highly variable. However, for pressure ridge ice keels a common morphology has been recognized. An in-depth study of extreme gouge features in five multi-beam bathymetric datasets, from the Beaufort Sea, has led to the development of a three-dimensional representative model of an <b>ice</b> <b>keel.</b> A qualitative 1 g scale model test comparing the representative three-dimensional model to a traditional prismatic wedge was conducted using Beaufort Sea clay. The experiment used a model pipeline to compare the loads from a representative keel to that of an idealized prismatic wedge. The three-dimensional representative model resulted in a lower force/deflection on the pipeline when compared to the traditional prismatic wedge shape model. However, the shape of the representative model keel resulted in proportionately higher stresses being transmitted through the soil than the simple prismatic model...|$|E
50|$|Sea ice is {{the outcome}} of {{freezing}} seawater. It is porous and mechanically weaker than glacial ice. Sea ice dynamics are highly complex. Driven by winds and currents, sea ice may ultimately develop into pressure ridges, a pile-up of ice fragments, or rubble, making up long, linear features. These are a very common source of seabed gouges. Pressure ridges are often enclosed inside expanses of drifting pack ice, such that gouging activity from sea <b>ice</b> ridge <b>keels</b> is closely related with pack ice motion. Stamukhi are also pile-ups of broken sea ice but they are grounded and are therefore relatively stationary. They result from the interaction between fast ice and the drifting pack ice. Stamukhi can penetrate the seabed to a considerable depth, and this also poses a risk to subsea pipelines at shore approaches.|$|R

Three distinct aspects of ice cover on the Great Lakes are examined, including {{the influence of}} ice cover on water column processes, the characteristics of ice cover on Lake Superior during a high-ice year, and the sensitivity of ice on the Great Lakes to climate. Three subsurface moorings were deployed in Lakes Superior during the record-high ice year of 2013 - 2014, and datasets from these moorings are analyzed alongside remotely-sensed ice cover data and regional meteorological observations. Ice cover on Lake Superior is shown to be predominately free-drifting, behaving more like ice on the oceans than ice on smaller lakes. Pressure sensors on the moorings directly measured deep <b>ice</b> <b>keels,</b> which frequently occurred at depths of more than 6 m and occasionally occurred at depths greater than 11 m. Late-season ice on Lake Superior during the 2013 - 2014 winter delayed spring warming, which is a mechanism that has previously been identified, but not directly observed. Ice cover is shown to influence surface currents on Lake Superior, resulting in a large-scale redistribution of heat in the western basin of the lake. Ice cover on the Great Lakes shows a linear sensitivity to air temperature, both empirically and through three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling. Small variations in seasonal air temperature, {{on the order of}} 1 to 2 °C, can be the difference between a moderate to high ice year and a very low ice year. Air temperatures during the time of ice formation have a significant influence on the amount of seasonal-average ice cover, while air temperatures during the remainder of the year do not greatly affect the amount of ice that forms. Shallow regions of the Great Lakes (< 10 m) exhibit similar sensitivity to air temperature as do smaller inland lakes, but the absolute amount of ice that forms on each of these different systems varies...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{observations}} of Storfjorden ice cover described the persistence {{and evolution of}} latent heat polynyas during winter 1997 / 1998. The induced important ice production was quantitatively estimated by simple modeling of the sea ice dynamics and growth. In the present work we used mathematical modeling to qualitatively simulate the polynya open and developing. First, we estimate the values of internal stresses appeared in Storfjorden ice sheet due to the wind stress and used them in the model calibration algorithm. Then, we model the polynya open and developing in simple quasi-static approach. The sea ice ridging process is modeled last and the maximum of ice ridges height is estimated. The results of the simulations are compared to satellite observations from ERS- 2. They show that the equilibrium stages of the model developing coincide in common with in-situ data of satellite observations. From another side, the estimations show that the <b>ice</b> ridge <b>keel</b> can achieve height up to 8 m along {{the eastern shore of}} Spitsbergen...|$|R
