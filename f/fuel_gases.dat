25|$|Oxy-fuel {{processes}} may use {{a variety}} of <b>fuel</b> <b>gases,</b> the most common being acetylene. Other gases that may be used are propylene, liquified petroleum gas (LPG), propane, natural gas, hydrogen, and MAPP gas. Many brands use different kinds of gases in their mixes.|$|E
25|$|For cutting, {{the setup}} {{is a little}} different. A cutting torch has a 60- or 90-degree angled head with {{orifices}} placed around a central jet. The outer jets are for preheat flames of oxygen and acetylene. The central jet carries only oxygen for cutting. The use of several preheating flames rather than a single flame {{makes it possible to}} change the direction of the cut as desired without changing the position of the nozzle or the angle which the torch makes with the direction of the cut, as well as giving a better preheat balance. Manufacturers have developed custom tips for Mapp, propane, and polypropylene gases to optimize the flames from these alternate <b>fuel</b> <b>gases.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{advanced}} {{process control}} application, using DMCplus? (Aspen Technology, Inc.), {{was developed to}} substantially reduce <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> losses to the flare at a large integrated refining / petrochemical complex. Fluctuations in internal <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> system pressure required changes in C 3 /C 4 make-up gas usage. These changes led, in turn, to some instability in the <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> system that sometimes required purge to the safety flare system to stabilize. As {{the composition of the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> supply changed, so did its heating value, which caused fluctuations in the control of various <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> consumers. The DMCplus application now controls <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> pressure tightly and also stabilizes the <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> heating value. The understanding of each <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> provider and user was essential to the success of this application, as was the design of the DMCplus application.

A rising concern is the <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> system transient response immediately after {{a significant reduction in}} the plant <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> consumption. Transient analysis models have been developed for typical <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> systems of combined cycle plants to ensure that the system is configured to respond appropriately to unplanned disturbances in <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> flow such as when a gas turbine trip occurs. Pressure control (regulator) and booster compressor control loop tuning parameters based on quantitative transient model results could be applied to set up targets for use in specifying and commissioning the <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> system.

40|$|Process {{analysis}} of refinery crude charge heater {{was used to}} investigate the effect of changes in <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> composition on crude charge heater efficiency of Port Harcourt refinery. Material and energy balance around the heater {{provided the basis for}} the calculation of heat absorbed by crude charge. The efficiency of the crude charge heater was then calculated as the quantity of heat absorbed by crude charge divided by the quantity of heat generated by combustion of <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> and the result multiplied by one hundred. This was done for various forced-draft fan (FDF) damper openings for <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> A (from the refinery mixing drum) and B (used to design the heater). Also the percentage oxygen content of the flue gas was calculated for the same FDF damper openings for the two <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> samples. For <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> A, the crude charge heater efficiency records ranged from 73. 34 to 82. 62 %, with the highest value 0 f 82. 62 % recorded at 45 % FDF damper opening. For <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> B, the efficiency ranged from 76. 51 to 86. 59 %, with the 45 %FDF damper opening also recording the highest value (86. 6 %). Statistical analysis showed that at various FDF damper openings, the efficiency values of the heater when firing <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> A were not significantly (p> 0. 05) different from the values when firing <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> B. Hence, changes in <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> composition have no significant (p> 0. 05) effect on the crude charge heater efficiency.
