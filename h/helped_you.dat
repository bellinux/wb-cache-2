2500|$|In November of the 2008–2009 season, O'Neal {{told reporters}} that he {{believed}} the entire feud has been {{the fault of the}} Lakers head coach Phil Jackson. O'Neal later retracted the statement and apologized, interrupting one of Jackson's pre-game interviews to give him a hug and a kiss on the cheek. On January 29, 2009, in an interview with Stephen A. Smith, O'Neal claimed that the feud between him and Bryant was simply a marketing ploy, saying [...] "We <b>helped</b> <b>you</b> hype it up. I know what I'm doing, brother. I'm the smartest player in the world." [...] On Bryant, O'Neal claimed that he [...] "always did love Kobe." [...] On Jackson, O'Neal claimed he is [...] "the greatest coach ever. And he's done a lot for me. Phil's my guy. It's all marketing, baby." [...] O'Neal also added that had he stayed with the Lakers, he and Bryant would have won another three or four titles. [...] "We're still the greatest little-man, big-man 1-2 punch ever created {{in the history of the}} game", O'Neal said. At the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, O'Neal, Bryant, and Jackson were all reunited on the West squad. O'Neal and Bryant were both named co-MVPs for the game and were shown laughing and hugging during the game. O'Neal told Bryant to keep the MVP trophy, but Bryant instead gave it to O'Neal's son. For O'Neal, Bryant's gesture marked a turning point in their relationship. Bryant and the Lakers would go to face the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA Finals. Shaq showed support for Kobe, on his Twitter page saying: [...] "thats right i am saying it today and today only, i want kobe bryant to get number 4, spread da word [...] ".|$|E
