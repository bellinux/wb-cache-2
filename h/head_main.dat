5000|$|Many European {{languages}} use a cognate of {{the word}} substantive as the basic term for noun (for example, Spanish , [...] "noun"). Nouns in the dictionaries of such languages are demarked by the abbreviation s. or sb. instead of n., which {{may be used for}} proper nouns or neuter nouns instead. In English, some modern authors use the word substantive to refer to a class that includes both nouns (single words) and noun phrases (multiword units, also called noun equivalents). It can also be used as a counterpart to attributive when distinguishing between a noun being used as the <b>head</b> (<b>main</b> word) of a noun phrase and a noun being used as a noun adjunct. For example, the noun knee can be said to be used substantively in my knee hurts, but attributively in the patient needed knee replacement.|$|E

40|$|The {{movement}} operation Verb Second {{moves the}} finite verb from its base-generated position in VP to C via the I node within the Chomsky (1986) framework. As the finite verb and the complementiser are in complementary distribution, the above predicts that, contrary to fact, Verb Second {{is not possible}} in embedded clauses. However, in Frisian and Swedish Verb Second does occur in embedded clauses. This entails that a lexical complementiser does not always prevent a finite verb from undergoing Verb Second. 'The aim {{of this paper is}} to provide a survey of Old English and Middle English root clauses particularly with respect to Verb Second. Old English does not strictly conform to Verb Second in declarative root clauses. In Old English finite verbs also occur in first position and in third position in declarative root clauses.

40|$|In {{drafting}} this essay, {{the author}} has counter-posed two compositional strategies, one based on conventional rhetorical structures, founded in enlightenment concepts of sequential logic, rationality, and isomorphism—i. e., the standard, academically sanctioned thesis essay form, proceeding in an orderly and hierarchical manner from <b>head</b> (<b>main</b> idea) through body (detailed breakdown and investigation of thesis points—equivalent to scientific testing or proof of an initial hypothesis/proposal, deploying transitions and focal topics to govern and control the content of each subsequent investigative unit (paragraph). From this perspective, the essay structure {{is very much the}} rhetorical double of the city plan it proposes to elucidate. Working against this more panoptically controlled hierarchical structure, is a postmodern turn toward [Internet] www-based, non-sequential organization. Hence, certain sections of the essay are potentially arrived at via mock-URLs, suggesting the tentative, self-consciously constructed, unnatural nature of the smoothly flowing logical structure; at any moment, a different link could be selected, interrupting/disrupting/complicating the logical and sequential arrangement. Also along these alinear lines are bolded fragments of text, suggesting an associational pattern of connectivity among images and ideas destabilizing and rendering motile the more static, rationally secured surface of the final product...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the issues strictly {{connected with the}} scientific discipline of Transport, concerning the exploitation of lighting devices, reflectors and projectors being the fundamental devices for tram’s head lighting. The factor influencing {{the safety of a}} moving track vehicle is the quality and state of tram’s head lighting. Appropriate light distribution within the area of tram’s foreground plays a decisive role in the perception of luminous sensations by the tram driver. A properly shaped light beam conditions appropriate visibility from the tram driver’s seat and facilitates correct assessment of traffic situations connected with the behaviour of other road traffic participants. The history of development of lighting devices for head lights used for trams has been discussed. The article proposes and discusses application of AFS system in trams particularly accounting for proposals of new lighting requirements for tram’s head lighting devices. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} photometric requirements for projectors and reflectors of tram’s head lights, presenting proposals for these requirements. After conducting a lighting analysis of currently exploited light beams it has been established that justification exists for using symmetrical light beams in the case of <b>head,</b> <b>main</b> and low beam lights.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the potential of}} deliberately light interpersonal touch (IPT) for reducing excessive head and trunk sway during self-paced walking {{in children and adolescents}} with cerebral palsy (CP). DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, proof-of-concept study with between-groups comparison. SETTING: Ambulant care facility, community center. PARTICIPANTS: 26 individuals with CP (spastic and ataxic; GMFCS I-III; mean= 9. 8 y; f= 11, m= 15) and in 39 typically developed (TD) children and adolescents (mean= 10. 0 y; f= 23, m= 16). INTERVENTIONS: ipt applied by a therapist to locations at the back and the <b>head.</b> <b>MAIN</b> OUTCOME MEASURES: As primary outcomes head and trunk sway during self-paced walking were assessed by inertial measurement units. Secondary outcomes were average step length and gait speed. RESULTS: CP group: apex and occiput IPT reduced head velocity sway compared to thoracic IPT (both p= 0. 04) irrespective of individuals' specific clinical symptoms. TD group: all testing conditions reduced head velocity sway compared to walking alone (all p≤ 0. 03) as well as in apex and occiput IPT compared to paired walking (both p≤ 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Deliberately light IPT at the apex of the head alters control of head sway in children and adolescents with CP. The effect of IPT varies as a function of contact location and acts differently in TD individuals...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to detect a {{cerebral}} microembolism rate and cerebral microembolism expression in patients with atrial fibrillation of the nonvalval etiology to clarify the correlation between the cerebral microembolism values and confirmed clinical and echocardiographic risk factors of the thromboembolic complications development. Materials and methods. 121 patients have been examined; 87 patients with different forms of the atrial fibrillation at the age of 34 — 75 years and 34 patients aged 30 — 75 years without a cardiac rhythm disturbance. The patient examination has been made according to the standards. Besides, all the patients have undergone an ultrasonic dopplerography of the extra- and intracranial vessels, a transcranial Doppler monitoring of the middle cerebral arteries {{for an hour and a}} duplex scanning of the <b>head</b> <b>main</b> arteries. Results. On a transcranial Doppler monitoring a spontaneous microembolism into the middle cerebral arteries in patients with atrial fibrillation of the nonvalval etiology has been recorded in 92 % of cases. A higher rate of a cerebral microembolism proves to be marked if there exists an echocardiographic phenomenon of spontaneous echo-contrast. An expression of a microembolic syndrome appears to be higher in patients with the atrial cavity thrombosis and a spontaneous contrast effect. Conclusion. Transcranial Doppler monitoring of the middle cerebral arteries in complex examination of patients with the atrial fibrillation promotes revealing patients with a high risk of the systemic thromboembolism development...|$|E
