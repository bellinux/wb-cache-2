50|$|In 1967, Charles Pedersen, who was {{a chemist}} working at DuPont, {{discovered}} a simple method of synthesizing a crown ether {{when he was trying}} to prepare a complexing agent for divalent cations. His strategy entailed linking two catecholate groups through one hydroxyl on each molecule. This linking defines a polydentate ligand that could partially envelop the cation and, by ionization of the phenolic hydroxyls, neutralize the bound dication. He was surprised to isolate a by-product that strongly complexed potassium cations. Citing earlier work on the dissolution of potassium in 16-crown-4, he realized that the cyclic polyethers represented a new class of complexing agents that were capable of binding alkali metal cations. He proceeded to report systematic studies of the synthesis and binding properties of crown ethers in a seminal series of papers. The fields of organic synthesis, phase transfer catalysts, and other emerging disciplines benefited from the discovery of crown ethers. Pedersen particularly popularized the <b>dibenzo</b> crown ethers.|$|E

40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{mainly the}} characterization of oxonol dyes, cyanine dyes and their complexes, especially with tetrathiafulvalene (TTF). Some work has also been done on titanium (IV) doped iron (III) oxide. Cyclic voltammetry shows that TTF and its derivative <b>dibenzo</b> TTF can be reversibly oxidized to its radical cation and dication in non-aqueous solution. The equilibrium potentials for two one-electron oxidation steps in acetonitrile/tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) were measured and found to be E(0,+.) = 0. 302 V and E(+.,++) = 0. 770 V for TTF and E(0,+.) = 0. 540 V and E(+.,++) = 0. 900 V for <b>dibenzo</b> TTF. Unlike cyanine dyes, oxonols are irreversibly oxidized and equilibrium potentials were measured by extrapolation of potential-sweep rate curves. Also using cyclic voltammetry, the rates of electron-transfer were calculated for TTF and <b>dibenzo</b> TTF {{as well as an}} electrochemical reduction series for some charge-transfer compounds relative to hydrogen reduction potential. The complex TTF/oxonol dye was prepared electrochemically at the optimum conditions. Its solubility and sensitivity towards pH changes were measured. Cyclic voltammetry shows that the complex is irreversibly oxidized and at lower voltages compared to its constituents TTF and oxonol dye. Electrical measurements show that the complex is a semiconductor and the energy gap is 0. 516 eV. First ionization potentials measured by photoelectron spectroscopy for TTF, <b>dibenzo</b> TTF and TTF-oxonol dye complex give approximately the same value which suggests that, the solution chemistry of these conpounds is different from their gaseous state behaviour. MNDOcalculations were used for geometry optimization, charge-density distribution, heats of formation and ionization potentials. Coupling constants and g-factors were calculated for TTF, its <b>dibenzo</b> derivative and its dye complexes using esr spectroscopy. Charge-transfer couplexes, particularly TTF/TCNQ show some degree of response towards polluting gases such as sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide as determined by their conductivity changes when the gases were passed over the surface. They may therefore be used as gas sensors if certain modifications in structure or electrode design could be made. Titanium (IV) Iron (III) oxide mixture shows a reasonable conductivity of 1. 4 x 10 ft cm but unfortunately a compressed pellet electrode is not mechanically stable. This problem can be solved by sintering the oxides with glass powder which resulted in a high resistance electrode in which some pH/voltage measurements have been done. <p...|$|E

40|$|A general {{review on}} macrocyclic ligands with {{particular}} emphasis to dibenzocryptand 222 and <b>dibenzo</b> 18 crown 6 {{is given in}} the first part of the thesis (Chapter 1). This is followed by an exhaustive literature survey on the stability constants (hence free energies of complexing), enthalpies and entropies of metal cations with cryptands (dibenzocryptand 222, benzocryptand 222, cryptand 222) and crown ethers (<b>dibenzo</b> 18 crown 6, benzo 18 crown 6, 18 crown 6) in water and in non-aqueous solvents at 298. 15 (Chapter 2). The experimental part (Chapter 3) also includes a detailed description of the principals involved in calorimetry as well as the methods used for the calculation of reaction enthalpies. Stability constant data for alkali-metal and silver cations with dibenzocryptand 222 in five dipolar aprotic solvents (N,N dimethyl-formamide, dimethylsulphoxide, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and nitromethane) at 298. 15 K are reported. These data are used to calculate the standard free energies of the complexation process involving metal(I) cations and dibenzocryptand 222 in the dipolar aprotic solvents. Free energy data are combined with enthalpy data obtained in this work in order to evaluate the entropies of complexation of these cations with dibenzocryptand 222 in these solvents. A linear correlation previously shown for metal(I) cations and cryptand 222 in DMF, Me 2 SO, AN, PC and NM between entropies of complexing and entropies of solvation of metal(I) cations in dipolar aprotic solvents is also found for dibenzocryptand 222. The results obtained in this thesis provide further evidence that the complexation process with metal (I) cations and cryptands is mainly controlled by the state of solvation of the cation in the solvent. Enthalpies of solution of dibenzocryptand 222 in the dipolar aprotic solvents are reported and the thermodynamic parameters for the extraction process in the water + nitromethane solvent system as described by M+(H 2 O) + 22 B 2 B(NM) → M+ 22 B 2 B (NM) are calculated (Chapter 4). Thermodynamic parameters of solution and transfer of <b>dibenzo</b> 18 crown 6 are discussed with respect to corresponding data for dibenzocryptand 222.

40|$|Association {{constants}} of the 1 : 1 complexes of {{a series}} of pyrido crown ethers 1 (n= 0 – 6) and a number of large ring (27 – 33 ring atoms) benzo and <b>dibenzo</b> crown ethers 2, 3 with alkali, barium and guanidinium chlorides have been determined potentiometrically in MeOH. For most of the ions besides a global maximum for 18 -membered rings, a local maximum for the complexation with 30 -membered rings is observed. The appearance of local maxima is attributed to the tennisball-seam like conformations that large macrocycles can adopt. The larger crown ethers show a remarkbly high K+ /Na+ selectivity similar to the antibiotic valinomycin, a structurally related 36 -membered macrocycle. Therefore, these large ring crown ethers can be regarded as synthetically easy to modify valinomycin mimics. The effects of the solvation of the hosts, guests and complexes on the overall (co-) complexation is discussed. Comparison of data from extraction experiments with association constants clearly shows that differences in the distribution of the complexes between the aqueous and organic phases may be a dominating factor for the selective extraction of cations...|$|E
40|$|Background. Depression is a {{relatively}} frequent encountered mental disorder in the general population, affecting both {{the quality of the}} individual life and its ability to perform the social tasks; it is generally accepted that new studies related to this pathologic condition are further necessary, in order to identify more adequate, efficient and accessible therapeutic compounds. Materials and methods. This study was performed on a sample of 60 white male mice, NMRI strain, who were divided into 6 groups of 10 animals and treated with 4 new derivatives of <b>dibenzo</b> [a, d] cycloheptene, amitriptyline as a reference substance, or with distilled water for the control group. The animals were tested in respect to the forced swim test, both before and at 2 hours after administration of the mentioned substances. It was determined thus the time of immobilization. Results. The study showed the fact that only two of the four investigated compounds presented {{a relatively}} similar antidepressant effect with the reference substance. Conclusions. Minor structural changes, such as modifications of some substitutes from the basic chemical core of the reference substance can decisively influence the conservation or loss of the antidepressant properties...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the usefulness of cyclodextrins (CDs) for the removal of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated <b>dibenzo</b> furans (PCDDs/PCDFs) in soil and water. Five CDs having different molecular cavities and active functional groups were selected and evaluated for their ability to include (trap) PCDDs/PCDFs in soil and water. For the soil experiments, CDs were added to the soil on day one and the concentrations of unbound PCDDs/PCDFs were monitored over a 28 -day period. Parallel control experiments were conducted to assist in the process performance evaluation. The ability of CDs to remove PCDDs/PCDFs from the contaminated soil was dependent upon the type of CD used and constituents of PCDDs/PCDFs. Among the five CDs investigated, hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) gave the highest removal efficiency for all components of PCDDs/PCDFs. The removal efficiency of total PCDDs/PCDFs was 81 % one day after application of CDs and then increased to 96 % after 28 days. The α-cyclodextrin (ACD) and β-cyclodextrin (BCD) removed only 45 % and 50 % of the total PCDDs/PCDFs after 28 days, respectively, whereas hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin (HPGCD) removed 80 % of the total PCDDs/PCDFs...|$|E
40|$|State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surface, Xiamen UniversityElectron {{paramagnetic}} resonance and electron-nuclear double resonance {{methods were}} used to study the polycyclic aromatic radical cations produced in a Friedel-Crafts alkylating system, and the following radical cations were indentified: 3, 6, 11, 14 -tetramethyl <b>dibenzo</b> (a, c) triphylene and 2, 6 -dimethyl- 9, 10 -di(p-methylbenzyl) anthracene radical cations. The {{results indicate that the}} observed electron paramagnetic resonance spectra are due to overcrowded polycyclic aromatic radical cations formed from the parent hydrocarbons. It is suggested that benzyl halides produced in the Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions undergo Scholl condensation to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are converted into corresponding polycyclic aromatic radical cations in the presence of AlCl(3). We carried out the theoretical calculation of the isotropic (1) H hyperfine coupling constants for studied both PAHs radical cations. The results indicate that the IEFPCM-DFT calculation at B 3 LYP level with 6 - 31 ++G(d,p), EPRII and EPRIII basis sets could well support the experimental hfcc assignment of the observed radicals. Optimized geometry indicates that the aromatic rings in both PAHs radical cations twisted significantly out of co-planarity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|Because of {{similarities}} {{in the structure of}} TCPy to trichlorophenol, from which dioxins and furans are known to be formed, the possibility of this occurring with CPY was considered. <b>Dibenzo</b> dioxins and furans were not detected (limit of detection (LOD) 0.006 to 0.0008 ng/g) in formulations of CPY [28]. A recent study reported the formation of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachloro- 1, 4 -dioxino-[2, 3 -b: 5, 6 -b'] dipyridine (TCDD-Py), an analog of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), when pure (2 mg) CPY was pyrolyzed in sealed ampules at 380 °C, but not 300 °C or 340 °C, for 15 min in the presence of 10 mL of air [29]. Greater amounts of TCDD-Py (≈ 100 -fold) were formed from pure TCP under all of the above conditions. TCDD-Py is unstable under the conditions of synthesis of CPY from TCP [30], suggesting that, even if it is formed, it will not become a contaminant in the commercial product. In a study of effects of combustion on the fate of TCP, only TCP and CO 2 were identified in smoke from cigarettes containing residues (900 ng/cigarette) of 14 C-labeled TCP. Detection limits for hexane-extractable non-polar compounds (2 % of total radioactivity applied) such as TCDD-Py were not provided [31].|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{develops a}} regulatory air dispersion coupled geostatistical model to predict congener-specific depositions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p- dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated <b>dibenzo</b> furans (PCDFs) emitted from a historically hazardous waste incinerator. The emission profile of dioxin congeners from the incinerator is hypothesized such that congener attributes impact the depositional pattern, resulting fingerprints in soil, thus better informing exposure models. The work also compares {{the performances of}} the two regulatory air dispersion models, ISCST 3 and AERMOD which are precursors to the geostatistical model in predicting dioxins’ air concentrations, dry and wet deposition fluxes and indentifying dioxin removal pathways in gaseous and particulate phase and by dry and wet deposition. Predicted dry and wet deposition fluxes are regressed against the newly collected dioxin soil data in a regression model, generating a spatial trend of dioxin concentrations. The spatial trend of dioxins is incorporated into the geostatistical model using Sequential Gaussian Simulation approach to predict census block-averaged soil concentrations of dioxin Toxic Equivalents (TEQs) to guide the soil sampling campaign. Finally, the coupled uncertainty-based spatial prediction model allows a validation of local uncertainty of the model in predicting spatial distribution of congener specific dioxins {{in the vicinity of}} an industrial hazardous waste incinerator...|$|E
