5|$|Densities of <b>giant</b> <b>clams</b> {{reach up}} to four per square foot {{in parts of the}} lagoon. The most common species is the “small giant clam” Tridacna maxima and largest clam species, Tridacna gigas is also found in the lagoon.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{damage was}} {{widespread}} but generally mild. Although damage to mangroves was minor, the cyclone defoliated swaths of many coastal and island forests. For the most part, cays and reefs were unharmed, with no visible {{change in the}} general appearance or shape of reefs and little underwater change as well. It was noted, however, that water clarity surrounding certain reefs was poor. River plumes of the Herbert, Tully, Murray, Hull, Johnstone, and Mulgrave/Russell rivers were noticeably changed, with some paths diverted. The Herbert River plume expanded to encompass areas near the Greater Palm group of islands, the Mulgrave/Russell around the Frankland Islands. In addition, {{the loss of a}} raft system utilized for farming of <b>giant</b> <b>clams</b> was noted near Fitzroy Island. Tourist operations experienced little damage from Winifred, with only minimal damage on Dunk Island, Bedarra Island, and Mission Beach. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and $130million (1986AUD) in damage, and was described by the Bureau of Meteorology as the worst cyclone to strike Queensland since Cyclone Althea in 1971.|$|E
25|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>clams</b> - The giant clam fishery {{was very}} short-lived, lasting {{about a year}} from 1990. This {{exploitation}} of the giant clam was very destructive to the reefs and the government banned the fishery in 1991.|$|E

50|$|The {{southern}} <b>giant</b> <b>clam</b> {{is classified}} as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List, and is listed on Appendix II of CITES. The southern <b>giant</b> <b>clam</b> is a popular food item and aquarium species, and has therefore been hunted extensively throughout its natural habitat. However, specimens traded today {{tend to be the}} result of aquaculture farms rather than wild-caught individuals, because the southern <b>giant</b> <b>clam</b> was one of the first clams to be bred commercially. This occurred at the MMDC <b>Giant</b> <b>Clam</b> Hatchery in Palau, which focused on Tridacna derasa in pioneering large-scale developments.|$|R

25|$|Other coastal {{resources}} such as cowrie and cuttlefish play a nominal role, and can be sustainably exploited at the present level. However, resources that can be cultured such as <b>giant</b> <b>clams,</b> sea cucumber, some species of aquarium fish, and turtles, have considerable potential.|$|E
25|$|Mariculture is {{the culture}} of marine organisms in seawater. The islands in the Maldives {{are too small to}} have inland fisheries, nor are there land based {{aquaculture}} activities at present. Fishing occurs in reef, coastal and offshore waters. However, various forms of mariculture are being experimentally trialled, such as {{the culture of}} pearls, <b>giant</b> <b>clams,</b> spiny lobsters, bêche-de-mer and grouper.|$|E

The largest <b>giant</b> <b>clam</b> at the Waikiki Aquarium was acquired from the Micronesian Mariculture Demonstration Center in Palau in June 1982 and {{was estimated to}} be five-years old at that time. At 38 years old in 2016, it is the longest-lived <b>giant</b> <b>clam</b> in any aquarium in the world.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to know the {{survival}} and growth of the <b>giant</b> <b>clam</b> larvae given zooxanthellae from different host. The field experiment was conducted from September ???November 2006 at hatchery of Marine Field Station Barrang Lompo Island, Makassar. Zooxanthellae hosts used were: (A) Table coral (Acropora valenciennesi); (B) Tridacna crocea, (C) soft coral (Sarcophyton trocheliophorum) and (D) control (no additional zooxanthellae). The Complete Randomized Design with four treatments and three replicates was applied in this research. The results showed that pediveliger larvae of <b>giant</b> <b>clam</b> (P< 0, 05).

40|$|To {{survive the}} {{juvenile}} stage, <b>giant</b> <b>clam</b> juveniles {{need to establish}} a symbiotic relationship with the microalgae Symbiodinium occurring in the environment. The percentage of <b>giant</b> <b>clam</b> juveniles succeeding in symbiosis establishment ("symbiosis rate") is often low, which is problematic for seed producers. We investigated how and why symbiosis rates vary, depending on whether <b>giant</b> <b>clam</b> seeds are continuously reared in UV treated or non treated seawater. Results repeatedly demonstrated that symbiosis rates were lower for UV treated seawater than for non treated seawater. Symbiosis rates were also lower for autoclaved seawater and 0. 2 -µm filtered seawater than for non treated seawater. The decreased symbiosis rates in various sterilized seawater suggest {{the possibility that some}} factors helping symbiosis establishment in natural seawater are weakened owing to sterilization. The possible factors include vitality of <b>giant</b> <b>clam</b> seeds, since additional experiments revealed that survival rates of seeds reared alone without Symbiodinium were lower in sterilized seawater than in non treated seawater. In conclusion, UV treatment of seawater was found to lead to decreased symbiosis rates, which is due possibly to some adverse effects common to the various sterilization techniques and relates to the vitality of the <b>giant</b> <b>clam</b> seeds...|$|R
2500|$|Dinoflagellate endosymbionts of {{the genus}} Symbiodinium, {{commonly}} known as zooxanthellae, are found in corals, mollusks (esp. <b>giant</b> <b>clams,</b> the Tridacna), sponges, and foraminifera. [...] These endosymbionts drive the formation of coral reefs by capturing sunlight and providing their hosts with energy for carbonate deposition.|$|E

[...] Most companies that produce virtual aquarium software also offer other types of fish for sale via Internet download. [...] Other objects found in an aquarium can also be added and rearranged on some software, like treasure chests and <b>giant</b> <b>clams</b> that open and close with air bubbles, or a bobbing diver. [...] There are also usually features that allow the user to tap on the glass or put food in the top, both of which the fish will react to. [...] Some also {{have the ability to}} allow the user to edit fish and other objects to create new varieties.|$|E
60|$|The sea, {{vast and}} wild as it is, bears thus the waste and wrecks of human art to its remotest shore. There is {{no telling what}} it may not vomit up. It lets nothing lie; not even the <b>giant</b> <b>clams</b> which cling to its bottom. It is still heaving up the tow-cloth of the Franklin, and perhaps a piece of some old pirate's ship, wrecked {{more than a hundred}} years ago, comes ashore to-day. Some years since, when a vessel was wrecked here which had nutmegs in her cargo, they were strewn all along the beach, and for a {{considerable}} time were not spoiled by the salt water. Soon afterward, a fisherman caught a cod which was full of them. Why, then, might not the Spice-Islanders shake their nutmeg trees into the ocean, and let all nations who stand in need of them pick them up? However, after a year, I found that the nutmegs from the Franklin had become soft.|$|E

5000|$|Seven {{of the ten}} known {{species of}} <b>giant</b> <b>clams</b> {{in the world are}} found in the coral reefs of the South China Sea. A {{programme}} to propagate endangered <b>giant</b> <b>clams</b> for release into the wild has been ongoing since 2007. Undertaken by the Marine Ecology Research Centre (www.merc-gayana.com) based in Gaya Island just west of Sabah’s capital, Kota Kinabalu, the programme successfully nurtured all seven species of the <b>giant</b> <b>clams</b> found in Malaysian waters to sufficient maturity for them to be placed in an ocean nursery for the first time during an awareness month from 22 March until 22 April 2012 in Maloham Bay. This marine awareness month had been planned to highlight and celebrate MERC's success in raising the giant clam larvae (called [...] "spats") to juvenile stage, to highlight the importance of the <b>giant</b> <b>clams</b> and to raise awareness and support with the general public on the threats that are faced by the <b>giant</b> <b>clams</b> within the sea. During this marine awareness month, the coral restoration programme entered its final stage and attachment of 1000 one-year-old coral fragments grown at MERC's ocean nursery onto the coral reef were done throughout the month. The coral restoration programme is aimed to provide the <b>giant</b> <b>clams</b> with a suitable home surroundings when they are big enough in the future to be placed onto the reef.|$|E
