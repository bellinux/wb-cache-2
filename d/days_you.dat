Turn to, to ‘shoot away’, pick up and store the catch and clean up. We worked bloody long hours. I think there were six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath. You would get your feed, climb down the hatchway to the mess room below. We would get {{a bucket of water}} from the galley to take to the forecastle where we bunked. By the time we got forward we would have only half a bucket of hot water to wash in but after a couple of <b>days</b> <b>you</b> didn’t worry about washing.

500|$|In {{the days}} after the Republican convention, McKinley {{remained}} in Canton. Hanna had been elected chairman of the RNC during the convention; he established campaign headquarters in Chicago, in the electorally-crucial Midwest, appointed an executive committee and began to organize the campaign, which as chairman was his responsibility. McKinley oversaw the activities of Hanna and other key managers, and addressed delegations of workers who came to visit him. He met with Hobart, who came to Canton on a brief visit on June 30, 1896, and who joined his running mate in speaking to a crowd of visitors. In his speeches, McKinley concentrated on tariffs, which he expected to dominate the campaign, and gave short shrift to the currency question.

500|$|When the {{legislation}} that would become Medicare was introduced in 1961, he created a recording for the American Medical Association (AMA) warning that such legislation would {{mean the end of}} freedom in America.

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} cast for their hamming and {{effective}} delivery of what Bennion called the [...] "stilted, stagy dialogue"; Toby Dantzic, writing for The Telegraph Saturday Review, called the acting [...] "stellar". The {{attention to detail}} by {{the cast and crew}} was widely praised; the [...] "dated styling" [...] was, for Jackson, [...] "spot on". Louisa Mellor, of the entertainment website Den of Geek, explained that [...] "from the aspect ratio to the music, title font, sets, lighting, camera moves, hair, make-up and costume... everything was recognisable from the sort of 1970s television plays that, when you think about it, may have provided inspiration for Inside No. 9 as a whole". For her, [...] "the retro send-up provided enough entertainment on its own—these <b>days</b> <b>you</b> have to be very good to make TV that bad". White, similarly, argued that [...] "it's a gargantuan, incredibly precise task to make such gloriously terrible TV, a skill reserved for only the greatest of comics". Even despite the flaws of the film within the episode, Rebecca Nicholson, of theguardian.com, found it [...] "relatively gripping". Sarah Hughes, writing in i, compared [...] "The Devil of Christmas" [...] to an episode of Tales of the Unexpected; it was she, argued, [...] "both an immaculately conceived homage to Roald Dahl's original anthology series and a worthy contender for its crown".|$|E
500|$|Hutchings {{introduced}} Drake to the 25-year-old American producer Joe Boyd, {{owner of}} the production and management company Witchseason Productions. The company was, at the time, licensed to Island Records, and Boyd, {{the man who had}} discovered Fairport Convention and been responsible for introducing John Martyn and The Incredible String Band to a mainstream audience, was a significant and respected figure on the UK folk scene. He and Drake formed an immediate bond, and the producer acted as a mentor to Drake throughout his career. A four-track demo, recorded in Drake's college room in the spring of 1968, led Boyd to offer a management, publishing, and production contract to the 20-year-old, and to initiate work on a debut album. According to Boyd:In those <b>days</b> <b>you</b> didn't have cassettes—he brought a reel-to-reel tape [...] that he'd done at home. Half way through the first song, I felt this was pretty special. And I called him up, and he came back in, and we talked, and I just said, [...] "I'd like to make a record." [...] He stammered, [...] "Oh, well, yeah. Okay." [...] Nick was a man of few words.In a 2004 interview, Drake's friend Paul Wheeler remembered the excitement caused by his seeming big break, and recalled that the singer had already decided not to complete his third year at Cambridge.|$|E
500|$|Roger Newcomb and Matt Richenthal, {{writing for}} {{websites}} We Love Soaps and TV Fanatic respectively, both described {{the decision to}} replace Russ with Nichols as surprising. Allison Waldman of AOL TV said the recast was [...] "bad news", as Russ was [...] "doing just fine as Tucker McCall, new billionaire in Genoa City". However, she also wrote that the role would be [...] "better suited" [...] for Nichols with Tucker becoming more of a [...] "romantic figure". Tara Blake of TVSource speculated that the character would be tied to a [...] "major Genoa City player" [...] {{and that was the}} reason for the recast. Gwen Morrett of About.com said that Nichols joining The Young and the Restless was [...] "truly their gain" [...] from Days of Our Lives (where the actor had previously portrayed Steve Johnson). Upon Nichols' debut, Megan Lynn of SoapNet wrote: [...] "Stephen certainly has soap experience — he's previously played Steve Johnson on Days of our Lives and Stefan Cassadine on General Hospital, but then again — we were kind of warming up to William." [...] Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps wrote of the decision to hire Nichols onto the series: [...] "This week, daytime fans get one of their wishes, to see Stephen Nichols back on daytime. From his role as Stefan on GH to Patch on <b>DAYS,</b> <b>you</b> know that Stephen Nichols is going to play Tucker for all he is worth, and then some." [...] In August 2010, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News wrote of Nichols' portrayal, saying: [...] "Now going into the 21st century, Stephen has reinvented another part of himself and inhabits Genoa City as the town’s newest and most handsome billionaire on CBS’s number-one daytime drama The Young and the Restless." ...|$|E
