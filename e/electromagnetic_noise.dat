2500|$|The {{electromagnetic}} (telecoil) mode {{is usually}} {{more effective than}} the acoustic method. This is mainly because the microphone is often automatically switched off when the hearing aid is operating in telecoil mode, so background noise is not amplified. Since there is an electronic connection to the phone, the sound is clearer and distortion is less likely. But in order for this to work, the phone has to be hearing-aid compatible. More technically, the phone's speaker has to have a voice coil that generates a relatively strong electromagnetic field. Speakers with strong voice coils are more expensive and require more energy than the tiny ones used in many modern telephones; phones with the small low-power speakers cannot couple electromagnetically with the telecoil in the hearing aid, so the hearing aid must then switch to acoustic mode. [...] Also, many mobile phones emit high levels of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>noise</b> that creates audible static in the hearing aid when the telecoil is used. [...] A workaround that resolves this issue on many mobile phones is to plug a wired (not Bluetooth) headset into the mobile phone; with the headset placed near the hearing aid the phone can be held far enough away to attenuate the static. [...] Another method is to use a [...] "neckloop" [...] (which is like a portable, around-the-neck induction loop), and plug the neckloop directly into the standard audio jack (headphones jack) of a smartphone (or laptop, or stereo, etc.). Then, with the hearing aids' telecoil turned on (usually a button to press), the sound will travel directly from the phone, through the neckloop and into the hearing aids' telecoils.|$|E

In addition, the tightly coupled transmission wires will reduce susceptibility to <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>noise</b> interference because the noise will equally affect each wire and appear as a common-mode noise. The LVDS receiver is unaffected by common mode noise because it senses the differential voltage, which is not affected by common mode voltage changes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a zero-current-switched voltage-fed inverter equipped with resonant circuits on the AC side. The current flowing through a switching device, i. e., an IGBT is a {{sum of the}} load current and the resonant current.

At Kyushu University, a mine detection system using a blimp has been developed 1). A magnetic gradiometer is appropriate for land mines including ferromagnetic material.

However, a sensor is exposed to <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>noises</b> caused by other metallic devices onboard, and its performance is very sensitive to the location of a sensor on the blimp.

Comparing these values with the previous experimental and theoretical values it is concluded that {{the greater part of}} resonant energy is dissipated in the region of ionic conductivity below 56 km.
