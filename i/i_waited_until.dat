2500|$|She still didn't stop {{moving so}} I stabbed {{her in the}} front of the chest. I was aiming for her heart. I needed two hands to get the knife through her chest. She kept moving so I kicked her in the head a couple of times. She still kept moving but she was slowing down. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> she stopped moving which didn't take long. [...] " ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{the first}} to arrive at the shore, and, lying at full length in the canoe, <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> my comrades {{returned}} from their visit.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> {{her first}} burst of emotion had worn itself out. Then I asked--with an uneasy conscience, with a sinking heart--what had {{happened}} to distress her.|$|E
6000|$|I {{could not}} refrain from smiling, but I was greatly discouraged. How could <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> evening for the desired interview? ...|$|R
6000|$|THE LADY. Nobody {{knows that}} better than <b>I.</b> <b>Wait</b> <b>until</b> you hear what I have come to tell you: you will {{understand}} me as no one else could. Listen. This spy, this woman-- ...|$|R
60|$|Now with an outlandish grace, To the {{sparkling}} fire I face In the blue room at Skerryvore; Where <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the door Open, and the Prince of Men, Henry James, shall come again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> {{the road}} was clear--it is never a very frequented one at any time, I fancy--and then I clambered over the fence into the grounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> his small, {{round eye}} had rolled {{back in my}} direction. [...] "Yes, Adam," [...] I said, [...] "but what did he say? You mean {{she told him about}} me?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ross came {{in fifteen}} minutes late. After the dishes had been cleaned away, <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> a propitious time when the room was {{temporarily}} ours alone, and told him what had happened.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, John love. I should dearly like to know, of course;' (which her anxious face confirmed;) 'but <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> you {{can tell}} me of your own free will. You asked me if I could have perfect faith in you, and I said yes, and I meant it.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> courteously <b>until</b> {{he rose to}} {{the surface}} again, when I {{repeated}} my remark.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have thought}} of this for weeks, and why should I {{postpone}} it? If the scene through which I have just passed has taught me to reflect, and has awakened me to a more anxious and careful sense of duty, why should <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the impression has cooled? You would not dissuade me, Kate; now would you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} this darned road would be tied up if <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> morning. I'm in real estate, and there's {{a deal on}} in my town I've got to watch every minute...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> Coulter joined Paxton. The two {{walked out}} on the campus, so I didn't catch what they said. I told them to follow me, and they are now out in the hall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks be {{to heaven}} {{that you have}} come. I had well nigh given you up, and in another minute should have closed the door. The women are all below, but <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> the last minute for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait until night, fool!" [...] blazed the Duke, {{turning on}} him, {{in a fierce}} joy at finding one whom he might rend. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> then, my throne is lost to me. This comes of sorting with traitors. It is your fault, you Judas!" [...] he cried more {{fiercely}} still, his face distorted; [...] "but you at least shall pay for what you have done." ...|$|R
60|$|I still {{persisted in}} trying to soothe her. I drew her to the window-seat. I said <b>I</b> would <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> {{she was able to}} speak to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I must," [...] I answered, with a sigh. [...] "I {{must believe}} what you tell me. Listen, then. <b>I</b> shall <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> you hear from your uncle." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{confess that}} I {{was filled with}} curiosity, but I was aware that Holmes liked to make his {{disclosures}} at his own time and in his own way, so <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> it should suit him to take me into his confidence.|$|E
60|$|Being {{very anxious}} to leave no stone unturned, <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> Mr. Spenlow came in, and then {{described}} what had passed; giving him to understand that I was not hopeless of his being able to soften the adamantine jorkins, if he would undertake the task.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> I saw {{him under}} {{the lights of the}} Grand Walk, and fairly running. Then I swung on my heel. I was of two minds whether to wait for Comyn, by far the wiser course. The unthinking {{recklessness}} I had inherited drove me on.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> patiently <b>until</b> {{he should}} see fit to go farther in his confidence. His {{preamble}} had, I need not say, {{filled me with}} interest and expectation.|$|R
60|$|He {{considered}} again. I {{saw that}} I {{had succeeded in}} interesting him in some way unknown to myself; and <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> patiently <b>until</b> {{he was prepared to}} answer me.|$|R
6000|$|Clearly he {{was unaware}} of my presence, and <b>I</b> stood <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> his pen should come to a pause. Old as he {{certainly}} was he wrote with a steady hand. [...] .|$|R
60|$|Crouching {{beside the}} brook, <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> {{one of the}} {{diminutive}} purple whales rose to nibble at the long grasses which overhung the water, and then, like the beast of prey that man really is, I sprang upon my victim, appeasing my hunger while he yet wriggled to escape.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Why do you ask? You know I {{am always}} {{glad to see}} you. I was afraid you would not come. You did not come last night and I was so sorry. Nothing in the orchard seemed nice any longer. I couldn't even play. I tried to, and my violin only cried. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> {{it was dark and}} then I went home." ...|$|E
60|$|Jones, admonishing me again, {{called the}} hounds and wearily climbed the slope. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> {{he was out}} of hearing; then began to retrace my trail down into the canyon. I made the descent in quick time, to find Emett {{standing}} guard over the lion. The beast had been tied to an overhanging branch that swung violently with every move he made.|$|E
6000|$|... "It would matter little. I {{should be}} done with my {{business}} by noon, but I should be in no hurry. <b>I</b> could <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> evening, if that would suit you better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} {{begun to think}} so yet," [...] Gerald laughed happily. [...] "At any rate <b>I</b> shall <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> get you home before such ideas begin to occur to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} {{you to give}} me more definite {{information than}} this," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "but now, I suppose, <b>I</b> must <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> hear from New York, at five dollars a message." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> {{they were}} quite close enough to hear me, and then I hailed them. I told them that we were friends of the Mezops, {{and that we were}} upon a visit to Ja of Anoroc, to which they replied that they were at war with Ja, and that if we would wait a minute they'd board us and throw our corpses to the azdyryths.|$|E
60|$|North-east of our train, {{not more}} than four hundred yards from it, we {{discovered}} a large camp of whites behind a low rise of ground. And beyond we could see fifty or sixty saddle-horses grazing. And {{a mile or so}} away, to the north, we saw a tiny cloud of dust approaching. Jed and <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> we saw a single man, riding fast, gallop into the camp of the whites.|$|E
60|$|Pausing there <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> the {{foremost}} Sagoth hove into sight. Ghak and Perry had disappeared around {{a bend in}} the left-hand canyon, and as the Sagoth's savage yell announced that he had seen me I turned and fled up the right-hand branch. My ruse was successful, and the entire party of man-hunters raced headlong after me up one canyon while Ghak bore Perry to safety up the other.|$|E
50|$|The other tomb on {{the right}} wall is of Cardinal Francesco Abbondio Castiglioni who died in 1568. The veined marble {{sarcophagus}} is placed on a high base which is decorated with the coats-of-arms of the Cardinal. The marble wall is flanked by Corinthian pilasters and crowned with a heavily articulated cornice and pediment. The realistic portrait bust of the deceised is set in an oval niche and a Latin inscription says: EXPECTO DONEC VENIAT IMMUTATIO MEA (<b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> my change comes).|$|R
6000|$|So a while I glowed, {{and then}} [...] Fell on dusty days and men; [...] Long I slumbered packed in straw, [...] Long I none but dealers saw; [...] Till before my silent eye [...] One that sees came passing by. [...] Now with an outlandish grace, [...] To the {{sparkling}} fire I face [...] In the blue room at Skerryvore; [...] Where <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the door [...] Open, and the Prince of Men, [...] Henry James, shall come again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps so," [...] said I; [...] "but, Legrand, I fear {{you are no}} artist. <b>I</b> must <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> see {{the beetle}} itself, if I am to form any idea of its {{personal}} appearance." ...|$|R
