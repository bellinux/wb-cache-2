40|$|LecturePg. 31 - 38 Variable speed <b>inverter</b> <b>motors</b> are {{increasingly}} being used to drive compressors for petroleum, chemical and gas industry services. In the past, as this type of application of large inverters, it has been possible to apply variable speed <b>inverter</b> <b>motors</b> to larger compressor trains. The power sources of the inverters have various frequency fluctuations depending on the inverter type. These torque fluctuations may cause torsional vibration on the shafts. Most centrifugal compressor trains that are driven by variable speed <b>inverter</b> <b>motors</b> use speed-increasing gears. Since the gear meshing force induced by the torsional vibrations also causes lateral vibrations in the compressor trains. This torsional and lateral coupled vibration model shows {{a difference in the}} rotordynamic characteristics apart from the results obtained from independent torsional and lateral studies. Therefore, a rotordynamic analysis that considers a coupled torsional and lateral vibration system is effective in evaluating torsional vibrations.
