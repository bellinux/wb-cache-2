These agents were injected into the AV node artery. Single injections of Bay k 8644 (0. 1 - 10 ILg) shortened AV cOndUCtiOn time, but the de-crease remained only about 9 msec at 1 0 g. This effect was not mOdified by nadolol. Dose-response curves for the negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of nifedipine were shifted to the right by about 0. 5 log units with infusions of Bay k 8644 into the AV node artery at rates of 3 and 1 0,g/min. A similar shift of dose-response curves to verapamil occurred at 1 0 g/min of Bay k 8644. However, Bay k 8644 (3 and 10 g/min) failed to modify dose-response curves to MnCl 2 and tetrodotoxin. Bay k 8644 (1 0 g) produced a greater decrease in AV conduction time during the negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of verapamil (1 0 or 30 g) and a far greater decrease durIng th negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of nife-dipine (3 or 1 0 g) than under control conditions.

The concept is widely accepted that excitation of AV node cells occurs predominantly by flow of the slow inward current through the slow channel in the cell membrane.

40|$|Adenosine has a {{negative}} <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect</b> and modulates hypoxia-induced atrioventricular (AV) conduction delay. To further characterize the negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of adenosine in the guinea pig heart, we determined a) the site of adenosine-induced AV conduction block; b) the effect of uptake and deamination of adenosine on its concentration-negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect,</b> and c) the adenosine receptor that mediates this action. In isolated AV node preparations (n = 16), adenosine in a dose-dependent manner decreased significantly the duration and amplitude of the action potential of atrionodal and nodal cells and, in addition, markedly depressed the maximum rate of rise of the action potential of nodal cells. At high concentrations (> 20 /AM), adenosine rendered nodal cells inexcitable. In isolated perfused hearts (n = 7), adenosine (5. 7 ^M) prolonged total AV conduction time by 21 ± 2 msec. Of this prolongation, 83 % was due {{to an increase in}} the nodal-to-HJs-bundle interval and the remaining 17 % to an increase in the atrionodal to nodal interval.

Injection of 25 and 50 µg/ml of ethacizin into the atrioventricular (AV) node artery significantly (p < 0. 001) prolonged AV conduction time with occasional second degree heart block. Conduction delay was located exclusively during the AH interval of the His bundle electrogram. Autonomic blockade did not alter the negative chronotropic or negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effects</b> of ethacizin. Ethacizin, 25 µg/ml injected into the sinus node artery immediately reduced the sinus node response to vagal stimulations by 30 % {{and the effect of}} acetylcholine, 0. 1 µg/ml, injected into the sinus node artery by 50 %. Ethacizin, 25 µg/ml, injected into the AV node artery immediately reduced the duration of complete AV block elicited by vagal stimulation or intranodal acetylcholine, 0. 5 µg/ml, by 90 %. Ethacizin caused a minor reduction in sinus node response to right stellate stimulations without, however, altering the sinus node response to intranodal norepinephrine. Ethmozin injections of up to 50 µg/ml, into the sinus and AV node arteries had no chronotropic or <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effects.</b> Ethmozin had a minor and variable vagolytic action but significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced the sinus node response to sympathetic nerve stimulation.

40|$|TOPIC: This study {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} chronic endocardial parasympathetic neural stimulation for dynamic ventricular rate control during atrial fibrillation {{and the development of}} an implantable neurostimulator with transvenuous intracardiac lead fixation and evaluation of its long-term efficacy. BACKGROUND: Efficient pharmacological ventricular rate control in patients with chronic permanent atrial fibrillation is not always easy to achieve and limited by potential side effects such as hypotension or bradycardia. Previous studys have shown, that the inferior interatrial ganglionated plexus (IAGP) selectively innervates the AV node. Temporary electrical stimulation of this plexus elicits a reduction of ventricular heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS: In 10 mongrel dogs, the small endocardial area in the right atrium overlying the IAGP was identified by neuromapping with probatory high-frequency stimulation (20 Hz) by using a custom-made positioning catheter with a distal pair of electrodes. After identification of the stimulation area, an active-fixation pacemaker lead was advanced through the inner lumen of the positioning catheter while leaving the catheter in the target area. After transvenuous lead fixation, the positioning catheter was slit and removed and the lead was connected with an implantable neurostimulator. An additional conventional DDD-pacemaker was implanted for initial induction of atrial fibrillation by high-frequency atrial stimulation (600 ppm) and for measurement of ventricular heart rate. In the first study group (n= 5) long-term lead stability was examined by weekly-intermittent neurostimulation. In the second study group (n= 4) continuous neurostimulation was performed during a period of 1 – 2 years for reduction of ventricular rate in a range of 100 – 140 bpm. RESULTS: Implantation of the neurostimulation lead was achieved in 37 ± 12 min. Neurostimulation resulted in a reversible negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect.</b> The on-/offset of the negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect</b> was sudden within 1 second after the initiation or termination of parasympathetic neurostimulation. The major determinants of neurostimulation efficacy were stimulation frequency, voltage and impulse duration. The required voltage for a reduction of the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation of about 40 % was less than 5 V with a chronaxie time of 0. 07 ± 0, 02 ms for a 50 % reduction in ventricular rate. In the first study group (n = 5) weekly-intermittent neurostimulation was effective and well tolerated by the animals during a 6 month follow-up. In the second study group (n = 4) continuous neurostimulation adjusted to achieve a mean ventricular rate decrease during atrial fibrillation of about 40 % was effective during a 1 - 2 years follow-up. CONCLUSION: Continuous parasympathetic stimulation via a cardiac neurostimulator implanted by transvenuous lead fixation and without the need of thoracotomy is possible and provides effective ventricular heart rate control during long-term follow-up. AV node selectivity and the possibility of a dynamic adjustment of the negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect</b> within seconds may be an advantage over pharmacological rate control...|$|E

The purposes {{of the present study}} were to characterize the cardiac actions and effects of an orally active and stable adenosine analog, N 6 -cyclohexyl- 2 -O-methyladenosine (SDZ WAG- 994) and to evaluate its potential as an antiarrhythmic agent. Guinea pig hearts were isolated and perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution. SDZ WAG- 994 slowed the atrial rate and prolonged the AV nodal conduction time of spontaneously beating hearts in a concentration-dependent manner. The EC 50 values for the negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects of SDZ WAG- 994 were 0. 69 +/- 0. 04 and 1. 49 +/- 0. 54 microM, respectively. The A 1 receptor antagonist 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -dipropylxanthine (0. 2 microM) significantly antagonized SDZ WAG- 994 -induced stimulus-to-His bundle (S-H) interval prolongation. The negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of SDZ WAG- 994 showed very strong frequency dependence. In hearts paced at an atrial cycle length of 300 msec (200 beats/min), the EC 50 value of SDZ WAG- 994 to prolong the S-H interval was 3. 7 -fold lower (0. 40 +/- 0. 02 microM) than in unpaced hearts, and at atrial pacing cycle lengths of 500 and 250 msec, 0. 3 microM SDZ WAG- 994 prolonged the S-H interval by 8 and 26 msec, respectively. SDZ WAG- 994 also decreased coronary perfusion pressure (EC 50 = 1. 50 +/- 0. 80 microM); this effect of SDZ WAG- 994 was attenuated by adenosine deaminase and by 8 -cyclopentyltheophylline (2 microM). Radioligand binding assays revealed that SDZ WAG- 994 had a 280 -fold greater affinity for A 1 - than for A 2 a receptors of the guinea pig brain.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the antiadrenergic effects of adenosine and carbachol on beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated human ventricular contractility in vivo. In addition, the antiadrenergic effect of adenosine and carbachol were compared in vitro. Background. Adenosine is reported to exhibit an antiadrenergic negative inotropic response in the beta-adrenergic-stimulated ventricular myocardium in vitro. The effect of adenosine is similar to the antiadrenergic effect of m-cholinoreceptor stimulation in vitro. Methods. The inotropic response in vivo was assessed in seven healthy volunteers by M-mode echocardiography and simultaneous blood pressure monitoring. It was calculated as the increase in the rate-corrected velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and in the systolic pressure/dimension ratio. All volunteers received pretreatment with 450 mg of dipyridamole/day for 48 h. In addition, the effects of adenosine and carbachol in the presence of 0. 03 μmol/liter of isoproterenol on cumulative concentration-response curves of isolated, electrically driven human ventricular muscle strips were compared in vitro (n = 13). Results. The positive inotropic response to continuous infusion of 20 ng/kg min of isoproterenol (increase of rate-corrected velocitly of circumferential fiber shortening [10. 2 ± 2. 1 % × √ beats/min per ms] and increase of systolic pressure/dimension ratio 109 ± 0. 3 mm Hg/mm) was significantly (p < 0. 01) reduced by 3. 6 μ/kg body weight of intravenous carbachol (4. 2 ± 1. 2 %× √ beats/min, 0. 21 ± 0. 18 mm Hg/mm) but not by 50 μg/kg of intravenous adenosine (8. 2 ± 3. 1 % × √ beats/min per ms, 1. 35 ± 0. 42 mm Hg/mm), although adenosine induced a significant negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect.</b> In vitro comparison of force of contraction with cumulative concentration-response curves in the presence of 0. 03 μmol/liter of isoproterenol demonstrated an EC 50 value (concentration producing <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect)</b> for adenosine 466 times higher than that for carbachol (65. 3 vs. 0. 14 μmol/liter, p < 0. 001).

We reported that the AV conduction delay and block caused by hypoxia is markedly attenuated by 10 microM aminophylline, and adenosine competitive antagonist. THe {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate adenosine's role in ischemic AV conduction disturbances. Dogs were anesthetized and instrumented for His bundle and surface electrogram recordings. The total AV conduction time was subdivided in to atrial-His bundle (AH) and His bundle-ventricle intervals. The atrioventricular node artery (AVNA) was cannulated for selective injection of drugs in the AV node region. Adenosine (10 to 100 microgram), as a 2 -ml bolus injection, rapidly produced a dose-dependent, transient increase in the AH interval; a 1, 000 -microgram dose caused second degree AV block. The duration of the increase in AH interval was also dose-dependent. Dipyridamole, and inhibitor of nucleoside transport, potentiated the negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effects</b> of adenosine, whereas aminophylline attenuated them. In some dogs, after cannulation of the AVNA, first and second degree AV block occurred spontaneously or were induced by rapid atrial pacing. Injection of the aminophylline (5 mg/kg, i. e.) or theophylline (100 - 1, 000 microgram) into the AVNA rapidly reversed the AV blocks. Upon washout of the drugs the AV blocks recurred.

The incidence of AF increases with advancing age. Also, subclinical hyperthyroidism is a risk factor associated with a 3 -fold increase in development of AF. Thyrotoxicosis exerts marked influences on electrical impulse generation (chronotropic effect) and conduction (<b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect).</b> Several potential mechanisms could be invoked for the effect of thyroid hormones on AF risk, including elevation of left atrial pressure secondary to increased left ventricular mass and impaired ventricular relaxation, ischemia resulting from increased resting heart rate, and increased atrial eopic activity. Reentry has been postulated as one of the main mechanisms leading to AF. AF is more likely if effective refractory periods are short and conduction is slow. Hyperthyroidism is associated with shortening of action potential duration which may also contribute to AF...|$|E
40|$|This study 1) {{compares the}} {{negative}} chronotropic and dromotropic actions of adenosine in guinea pig, rat, and rabbit hearts; 2) investigates the mechanism(s) {{for the different}} responses; and 3) determines the physiological implications. Isolated perfused hearts were instrumented for measurement of atrial rate and atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction time. Differences in metabolism of adenosine were determined in the absence and presence of dipyridamole (nucleoside uptake blocker) and erythro- 9 -(2 -hydroxy- 3 -nonyl) adenine (EHNA, adenosine deaminase inhibitor). Dipyridamole plus EHNA decreased adenosine's ECso for the negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect</b> by 14 -fold in guinea pig heart and 1. 6 -fold in rat heart. This {{is consistent with the}} greater number of [31 H]nitrobenzylthioinosine binding sites measured in membranes from guinea pig (1, 231 + 68 fmol/mg protein) compared with rat (302 +± 31 fmol/mg protein) and rabbit (260 ± 28 fmol/mg protein) atria. The potency of adenosine to slow atrial rate and prolong AV nodal conduction time was greater in guinea pig than in rat or rabbit hearts. This rank order of potency correlated well with the number of binding sites for the specific adenosine receptor radioligand 1211 -aminobenzyladenosine in guinea pig (102 ±+ 13 fmollmg protein), rat (11 ± 0. 5 fmol/mg protein), and rabbit (8 ± 1 fmol/mg protein) atrial membranes.

40|$|Although the {{physiological}} and pharmacological evidences suggest {{a role for}} angiotensin II (Ang II) with the mammalian heart, the source and precise location of Ang II are unknown. To visualize and quantitate Ang II in atria, ventricular walls and interventricular septum of the rat and human heart and to explore the feasibility of local Ang II production and function, we investigated by different methods the expression of proteins involved in the generation and function of Ang II. We found mRNA of angiotensinogen (Ang-N), of angiotensin converting enzyme, of the angiotensin type receptors AT(1 A) and AT(2) (AT(1 B) not detected) {{as well as of}} cathepsin D in any part of the hearts. No renin mRNA was traceable. Ang-N mRNA was visualized by in situ hybridization in atrial ganglial neurons. Ang II and dopamine- -hydroxylase (D H) were either colocalized inside the same neuronal cell or the neurons were specialized for Ang II or D H. Within these neurons, the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) was neither colocalized with Ang II nor D H, but VAChT-staining was found with synapses en passant encircle these neuronal cells. The fibers containing Ang II exhibited with blood vessels and with cardiomyocytes supposedly angiotensinergic synapses en passant. In rat heart, right atrial median Ang II concentration appeared higher than septal and ventricular Ang II. The distinct colocalization of neuronal Ang II with D H in the heart may indicate that Ang II participates together with norepinephrine in the regulation of cardiac functions: Produced as a cardiac neurotransmitter Ang II may have inotropic, chronotropic or <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effects</b> in atria and ventricles and contributes to blood pressure regulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESTo {{identify}} intravascular {{sites for}} continuous, stable parasympathetic stimulation (PS) {{in order to}} control the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation (AF). BACKGROUNDVentricular rate control during AF in patients with congestive heart failure is a significant clinical problem because many drugs that slow the ventricular rate may depress ventricular function and cause hypotension. Parasympathetic stimulation can exert negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effects</b> without significantly affecting the ventricles. METHODSIn 22 dogs, PS was performed using rectangular stimuli (0. 05 ms duration, 20 Hz) delivered through a catheter with an expandable electrode-basket at its end. The catheter was positioned either in the superior vena cava (SVC, n = 6), coronary sinus (CS, n = 10) or right pulmonary artery (RPA, n = 6). The basket was then expanded to obtain long-term catheter stability. Atrial fibrillation was induced and maintained by rapid atrial pacing. RESULTSNonfluoroscopic (SVC) and fluoroscopic (CS/RPA) identification of effective intravascular PS sites was achieved within 3 to 10 min. The ventricular rate slowing effect during AF started and ceased immediately after on-offset of PS, respectively, and could be maintained over 20 h. In the SVC, at least a 50 % increase of ventricular rate (R-R) intervals occurred at 22 ± 11 V (331 ± 139 ms to 653 ± 286 ms, p < 0. 001), in the CS at 16 ± 10 V (312 ± 102 ms vs. 561 ± 172 ms, p < 0. 001) and in the RPA at 18 ± 7 V (307 ± 62 ms to 681 ± 151 ms, p < 0. 001). Parasympathetic stimulation did not change ventricular refractory periods. CONCLUSIONSIntravascular PS results in a significant ventricular rate slowing during AF in dogs. This may be beneficial in patients with AF and rapid ventricular response since many drugs that decrease atrioventricular conduction have negative inotropic effects which could worsen concomitant congestive heart failure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the safety of adenosine infusion at 140 μg/kg per min in conjunction with radionuclide imaging in 9, 256 consecutive patients. Background. Adenosine produces maximal myocardial hyperemia directly with a rapid onset of action. In addition, when used in conjunction with radtonuclide perfusion imaging, it has proven efficacy for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease in patients unable to exercise. Because the ultrashort half-life (70 years of age had an increased risk of developing AV block (age < 70, 7. 05 % vs. ≥ 70, 9. 44 %, p = 0. 001, relative risk 1. 37). Conclusions. Adenosine infusion is safe. Vasodilator and negative <b>dromotropic</b> side <b>effects</b> are generally well tolerated. Serious side effects are relatively rare, and they reverse with termination of adenosine infusion. Interpretable radionuclide studies were obtained in 98. 7 % of patients and aminophylline reversal was seldom required...|$|R
40|$|Adenosine {{as well as}} hypoxia and {{ischemia}} {{are known}} to cause atrioventricular conduction block. To test the hypothesis that adenosine is the primary mediator of hypoxla-lnduced atrioventricular con-duction delay in isolated perfused guinea pig hearts, we characterized a) the time courses of hypoxia-induced adenosine release and delay in atrioventricular conduction, b) the relationships between oxygen tension, adenosine concentration in the effluent, and atria-to-His-bundle interval, and c) the adenosine receptor mediating the negative <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of hypoxia. Oxygen tension and effluent adenosine levels were linearly related with a correlation coefficient (r) of- 0. 85 and a slope of- 6. 3 ± 0. 37 pmol/min/g/torr. Likewise, oxygen tension and atria-to-His-bundle interval prolonga-tion were linearly related with r =- 0. 85 and a slope of- 0. 180 ± 0. 013 msec/torr. The EC 50 of effluent adenosine in causing atria-to-His-bundle prolongation was 0. 26 ± 0. 02 fiM. Adenosine de-aminase, an enzyme that deaminates adenosine to inosine and {{is limited to the}} extracellular space, significantly attenuated (61 %) the atria-to-His-bundle interval prolongation caused by hypoxia. This prolongation was further reduced (81 %) by a combination of adenosine deaminase and theophylline, an adenosine receptor blocker. Adenosine deaminase also reduced (by 95 %) the atria-to-His-bundle interval prolongation in normoxk recipient hearts caused by the effluent of hypoxic donor hearts.

40|$|Amiodarone was {{selectively}} perfused {{into the}} sinus node artery and atrioventricular node artery of 51 dogs. Amiodarone had an immediate negative chronotropic and <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect.</b> Threshold concentration was 2. 5 micrograms/ml. 25 and 50 micrograms/ml of amiodarone {{injected into the}} sinus node artery slowed the heart by 25. 6 +/- 3. 1 and 33. 7 +/- 2. 6 beats/min (mean +/- 1 SEM), respectively. Amiodarone 25 and 50 micrograms/ml injected into the AV node artery during AV junctional rhythm slowed the AV junctional pacemaker by 12. 2 +/- 1. 8 and 17. 4 +/- 1. 7 beats/min, respectively. Injections of amiodarone into the AV node artery during sinus rhythm regularly increased AV conduction time sometimes causing 2 degrees AV block at the highest concentration used. Impaired conduction was exclusively measured {{at the level of}} the A-H interval in the His electrogram. Neither atropine nor propranolol prevented the negative chronotropic effects of amiodarone. Amiodarone had no significant effect on sinus node response to either stellate stimulation or intranodal administration of norepinephrine. The negative chronotropic action of amiodarone was significantly enhanced when amiodarone was administered in a perfusate containing low (0. 6 mM) instead of normal calcium. Taken collectively these observations indicate that amiodarone has immediate depressant electrophysiologic effects on both the sinus node and the AV junction and that these early effects might involve the blockade of the slow channel...|$|E
40|$|Perturbations of the trans-sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic Ca 2 + {{transport}} {{contribute to}} the abnormal myocardial activity provoked by anoxia and reoxygenation. Whether Ca 2 + pools of the extracellular compartment and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) are involved {{to the same extent}} in the dysfunction of the anoxic-reoxygenated immature heart has not been investigated. Spontaneously contracting hearts isolated from 4 -day-old chick embryos were submitted to repeated anoxia (1 min) followed by reoxygenation (5 min). Heart rate, atrioventricular propagation velocity, ventricular shortening, velocities of contraction and relaxation, and incidence of arrhythmias were studied, recorded continuously. Addition of verapamil (10 nM), which blocks selectively sarcolemmal L-type Ca 2 + channels, was expected to protect against excessive entry of extracellular Ca 2 +, whereas addition of ryanodine (10 nM), which opens the SR Ca 2 + release channel, was expected to increase cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration. Verapamil (a) had no <b>dromotropic</b> <b>effect</b> by contrast to adult heart, (b) attenuated ventricular contracture induced by repeated anoxia, (c) shortened cardioplegia induced by reoxygenation, and (d) had remarkable antiarrhythmic properties during reoxygenation specially. On the other hand, ryanodine potentiated markedly arrhythmias both during anoxia and at reoxygenation. Thus despite its immaturity, the SR seems to be functional early in the developing chick heart and involved in the reversible dysfunction induced by anoxia-reoxygenation. Moreover, Ca 2 + entry through L-type channels appears to worsen arrhythmias especially during reoxygenation. These findings show that the Ca 2 +-handling systems involved in irregular activity in immature heart, such as the embryonic chick heart, may differ from those in the adult...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVagus nerve {{stimulation}} (VNS) is an established therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy and depression, {{and is considered}} as a potential therapy for other pathologies, including Heart Failure (HF) or inflammatory diseases. In the case of HF, several experimental studies on animals have shown an improvement in the cardiac function and a reverse remodeling of the cardiac cavity when VNS is applied. However, recent clinical trials {{have not been able}} to reproduce the same response in humans. One of the hypothesis to explain this lack of response is related to the way in which stimulation parameters are defined. The combined effect of VNS parameters is still poorly-known, especially in the case of VNS synchronously delivered with cardiac activity. In this paper, we propose a methodology to analyze the acute cardiovascular effects of VNS parameters individually, as well as their interactive effects. A Latin hypercube sampling method was applied to design a uniform experimental plan. Data gathered from this experimental plan was used to produce a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model in order to estimate unobserved VNS sequences. Finally, a Morris screening sensitivity analysis method was applied to each obtained GPR model. Results highlight dominant effects of pulse current, pulse width and number of pulses over frequency and delay and, more importantly, the degree of interactions between these parameters on the most important acute cardiovascular responses. In particular, high interacting effects between current and pulse width were found. Similar sensitivity profiles were observed for chronotropic, <b>dromotropic</b> and inotropic <b>effects.</b> These findings are of primary importance for the future development of closed-loop, personalized neuromodulator technologies. © 2017 SPIE...|$|R
40|$|Propofol, an {{intravenous}} anaesthetic agent, {{can affect}} cardiac conduction but the ionic mechanisms {{have not been}} well defined. This study measured the direct effects of propofol on the cardiac conduction system by using intracardiac recording/stimulation in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. The underlying ionic mechanism was elucidated by using the whole-cell voltage clamp on rabbit isolated atrial and ventricular myocytes. Propofol prolonged significantly the AV conduction (AH) interval at a clinically relevant concentration (3 [*]μM). This AH interval prolongation was dose-dependent (3 to 100 [*]μM). At higher concentrations, the AV nodal Wenckebach cycle length and its refractory period were also prolonged (10 to 100 [*]μM). In addition, the conduction through the His-Purkinje system (HV interval) and the atrial tissue (SA interval), {{as well as the}} spontaneous cycle length, were lengthened dose-dependently (30 to 100 [*]μM). In isolated ventricular myocytes, Na current was decreased dose-dependently by propofol. In part this was due to a negative-shift of the steady-state voltage-dependent inactivation and a slowed rate of recovery from inactivation. The INa suppression by propofol was frequency-dependent. Propofol also blocked the ICa. The ED 50 for peak current inhibition was 6. 9 ± 0. 9 (n= 6) and 8. 3 ± 1. 5 [*]μM (n= 7) for INa and ICa, respectively. The transient outward potassium current (Ito) of atrial myocytes was suppressed with an ED 50 of 5. 7 ± 0. 8 [*]μM (n= 11), which was only partly caused by a left-shift of the steady-state inactivation. The inward rectifier K current (IK 1) of the ventricular cells was reduced somewhat by propofol. In summary, propofol can cause direct <b>dromotropic</b> and chronotropic <b>effects</b> on the cardiac conduction system, especially the atrioventricular node. These changes can be attributed, at least in part, to its direct dose-dependent suppression of the cardiac ICa, INa and Ito. Special concerns in the use of propofol anaesthesia for cardiac patients and the therapeutic antiarrythmic potential of propofol-like compounds are addressed...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of published data on clinical manifestation of cardiovascular diseases {{in patients with}} subclinical changes of thyroid gland functions. Prevalence and risk factors for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, current understanding of cardiovascular pathology in thyroid disease, especially in its subclinical forms are discussed. The action of thyroid hormones on the heart is manifested by positive inotropic, chronotropic, <b>dromotropic</b> and bathmotropic <b>effects,</b> leading to rapid heart rate, improvement of impulses conduction in myocardium, increased excitability of the heart muscle and reduction in systemic peripheral vascular resistance. Subclinical thyroid pathology {{is considered to be}} an independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation. It was found that thyroid hormones have short- and long-term cardiotropic effects. Short-term cardiotropic effects are characterized by tachycardia, atrial extrasystoles and atrial fibrillation. Long-term effects are the results of heart overload including left ventricular overload, which is manifested by impaired diastolic and systolic performance, especially during exercise. Clinical signs of the aspects of subclinical hypothyroidism depend on individual sensitivity to increased levels of thyroid hormones. It is believed that subclinical hyperthyroidism is an independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation associated with a number of cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease, arterial hypertension. It was concluded that in addition to laboratory monitoring of thyroid function for the diagnosis in the absence of clinical signs thyroid ultrasound, heart rate assessment and, if necessary, radionuclide scanning should be performed. Modern approaches to the treatment of subclinical thyroid pathology, especially necessity of thyreostatics administration in subclinical hyperthyroidism accompanied by atrial fibrillation. The treatment of cardiac disorders includes β-blockers administration (preferably non-selective). In some cases, particularly if there is evidence of subclinical hyperthyroidism associated with a large nodular goiter. Approaches to the disease prediction on the basis of antibody levels are discussed. It was concluded that current guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of subclinical forms of thyroid disease are conflicting. Targeted screening of populations with risks factors for thyroid function disorders is considered to be feasible by most investigator. It was also noticed that these patients should be closely monitored, particularly they should regular visit cardiologist and endocrinologist and determine the TSH level...|$|R
