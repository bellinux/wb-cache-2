In this case, there is a stronger field seen within the channel due to a higher gate capacitance.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{have studied}} the effects of {{internally}} applied divalent cations on the <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> of voltage-clamped squid giant axons. Internal concentrations of calcium up to 10 mM have little, if any, effect on the time-course, voltage dependence, or magnitude of the <b>ionic</b> <b>currents.</b> This is inconsistent {{with the notion that}} an increase in the internal calcium concentration produced by an inward calcium movement with the action potential triggers sodium inactivation or potassium activation. Low internal zinc concentrations (N 1 mM) selectively and reversibly slow the kinetics of the potassium current and reduce peak sodium current by about 40 % with little effect on the voltage dependence of the <b>ionic</b> <b>currents.</b> Higher concentrations (10 mM) produce a considerable (ca. 90 %) nonspecific reversible reduction of the <b>ionic</b> <b>currents.</b> Large hyperpolarizing conditioning pulses reduce the zinc effect. Internal zinc also reversibly depolarizes the axon by 20 - 30 mV.

In clinical contexts, EEG refers to the recording of the brain's spontaneous electrical activity {{over a period of}} time, as recorded from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp.

2500|$|These {{groups were}} {{studying}} {{the responses of}} large pyramidal projection neurons to GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. GABA is typically released by small interneurons in many regions of the brain, where its job is to inhibit the activity of primary neurons, such as the CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus or the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. [...] Activation of GABA receptors on these cells, whether they are ionotropic or metabotropic, typically results in the influx of chloride ions into that target cell. [...] This build-up of negative charge from the chloride ions results in the hyperpolarization of the target cell, making it less likely to fire an action potential. [...] Accordingly, any <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> that hyperpolarizes a cell is called an inhibitory current.|$|E

40|$|During cardiomyocyte development, early {{embryonic}} ventricular cells show {{spontaneous activity}} that disappears {{at a later}} stage.

To simulate the action potential of the rodent ventricular cell at three representative developmental stages, quantitative changes in the <b>ionic</b> <b>currents,</b> pumps, exchangers, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 + kinetics were represented as relative activities, which were multiplied by conductance or conversion factors for individual ionic systems. The simulated action potential of the early embryonic ventricular cell model exhibited spontaneous activity, which ceased in the simulated action potential of the late embryonic and neonatal ventricular cell models. The simulations with our models were able to reproduce action potentials that were consistent with the reported characteristics of the cells in vitro.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{changes in}} <b>ionic</b> and gating <b>currents</b> in CaV 1. 2 channels when extracellular Ca 2 + was reduced from 10 mm to 0. 1 μm. Saturating gating currents decreased by two-thirds (KD≈ 40 μm) and <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> increased 5 -fold (KD≈ 0. 5 μm) due to increasing Na+ conductance. A biphasic time dependence for the activation of <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> {{was observed at}} low [Ca 2 +], which appeared to reflect the rapid activation of channels that were not blocked by Ca 2 + and a slower reversal of Ca 2 + blockade of the remaining channels. Removal of Ca 2 + following inactivation of Ca 2 + currents showed that Na+ currents were not affected by Ca 2 +-dependent inactivation. Ca 2 +-dependent inactivation also induced a negative shift of the reversal potential for <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> suggesting that inactivation alters channel selectivity.

30|$|The {{parameters}} of conductance-based models are typically fit to voltage-clamp recordings. In these experiments, individual <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> are isolated using pharmacological blockers and one measures current traces {{in response to}} voltage pulses. However, many electrophysiological datasets consist of current-clamp rather than voltage-clamp recordings. In current-clamp, one records a voltage trace (e.g., a series of action potentials) in response to injected current. Fitting a conductance-based model to current-clamp data is challenging because the individual <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> have not been measured directly. In terms of the Hodgkin–Huxley model, only one state variable (V) has been observed, {{and the other three}} state variables (m, h, and n) are unobserved. Conductance-based models of neurons often contain several <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> and, therefore, more unobserved gating variables and more unknown or poorly known parameters. For example, a model of HVC neurons in the zebra finch has 9 <b>ionic</b> <b>currents,</b> 12 state variables, and 72 parameters [2]. An additional difficulty in attempting to fit a model to a voltage trace is that if one performs a least-squares minimization between the data and model output, then small differences in the timing of action potentials in the data and the model can result in large error [3]. Data assimilation methods have the potential to overcome these challenges by performing state estimation (of both observed and unobserved states) and parameter estimation simultaneously.|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel, sensitive and less time-consuming method to detect activity of the SecA-dependent protein-conducting channels. Nanogram levels of E. coli inverted membrane vesicles were injected into Xenopus oocytes, and <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> were recorded using the two-electrode voltage clamp. Currents were observed only {{in the presence of}} E. coli SecA in conjunction with E. coli membranes. The observed currents showed outward rectification in the presence of KCl as permeable ions and were significantly enhanced by coinjection with the precursor protein, proOmpA, or active LamB signal peptide. Channel activity was blockable with sodium azide or adenylyl 5 ’-(β, γ-methylene) -diphosphonate, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, both of which are known to inhibit SecA protein activity. Channel activity was also stimulated by oocyte endogenous precursor proteins, which could be inhibited by puromycin. In the presence of puromycin, exogenous proOmpA or LamB signal peptides, but not defective signal peptides, stimulated the <b>ionic</b> <b>currents.</b> We also measured SecA-dependent currents with membranes depleted of SecYEG. Wild-type LamB signal peptides, or precursor proteins stimulated <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> following a co-injection of SecYEG¯ membranes with puromycin. Excess exogenous SecA stimulated <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> through SecYEG¯ membranes. Similar activities of added SecA were observed with reconstituted membranes depleted of SecYEG. Currents through such SecYEG-depleted membranes were also stimulated by addition of defective LamB signal peptides and unfolded mature PhoA protein. In contrast, currents produced by the membranes containing wild-type SecYEG were not so stimulated, but <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> were stimulated through mutant strains, similar to PrlA (SecY) suppressors, e. g. PrlA 4, or PrlA 665 membranes, suggesting that the proofreading function of SecY was bypassed in these membranes. We have observed that azide can inhibit <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> when E. coli wild-type MC 4100 membranes were injected with proOmpA or LamB signal peptides into Xenopus oocytes. However, such inhibition was lost when observed with oocyte-endogenous signal peptides in the absence of bacterial signal peptides. Moreover, azide did not show complete inhibition upon using SecYEG¯ membranes or SecYEG¯ reconstituted membranes plus excess SecA in {{the presence or absence of}} LamB signal peptides. Such conformational alterations reflect different sensitivity in response to azide during the opening of protein-conducting channels...|$|R
