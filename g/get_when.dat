In the email, Apple also wrote that employees should first ask the customer if they want a bag, rather than giving them one without asking.|$|E

500|$|The {{novel is}} narrated {{in the first}} person through a series of [...] nine journaux intimes, kept by Mountstuart from age 17 until shortly before his death at 85. French {{literary}} journals, always published posthumously, are often extremely candid accounts, particularly of the author's sexual life. Boyd, himself a francophile, includes masturbation, prostitution and Mountstuart's three marriages. While Boyd had earlier written work in the form of memoir or biography, a journal is different: [...] "For a start, it's written without the benefit of hindsight, so there isn't the same feeling you <b>get</b> <b>when</b> you look back and add shape to a life. There are huge chunks missing." [...] The novel's grounding in everyday life and focus on characterisation place it firmly within realism.|$|E

[...] Dutch public TV channel Nederland 2's daily news programme Netwerk reported that numerous American supporters of Israel financially supported Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) and openly approved of his message towards Islam and Islamic terrorism.

In a 2004 interview, Coombes said [...] "It wasn't trying to be a real statement, but at the time we knew that it was a big deal. Kids all around England were getting nicked for having a bit of hash on them. In Oxford that kind of thing happened quite a lot. It's all true so it was easy to write. It was a funny experience – not too funny at the time 'cause I was only 15 and shitting myself. The song has that disturbing energy. It's comparable to your heart racing.

[...] The video marks one of the early directorial efforts of Spike Jonze, whose pitch was simply [...] "A blue stage, a steadicam, a pack of wild dogs." [...] The video became an instant hit on MTV. [...] The final single, [...] "Say it Ain't So", was again inspired by Cuomo believing his parents split up when he was four because he thought his dad was an alcoholic. The music video, which was directed by Sophie Muller, was less successful than the previous Spike Jonze-directed video. It featured the band performing in the garage of their former house, and the bandmates playing hacky sack in the backyard.|$|E

Collaborating with Ultima Underworld II programmer Greg Travis, he created a thirty page concept document that outlined the game. His core idea was to recreate the [...] "yummy, visceral, fluid feeling that you <b>get</b> <b>when</b> flying a real airplane". He wanted the project to bear more resemblance to a playground than to a video game, and he sought to give it simple controls and realistic terrain to decrease the learning curve for beginners. Blackley {{assumed the role of}} project leader and then engaged the team in [...] "flaming sessions" [...] to generate ideas. According to programmer Doug Church, Blackley's concept of the game was not fully developed, but he clearly expressed his thoughts and motivated the team. The first months of the project produced disparate prototypes that demonstrated prospective features. The company committed to full development of the game in early 1993, and production commenced in March.|$|E

The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A superb episode. Some colorful background for Homer and Marge (and a glimpse of Homer and Barney's schooldays) plus our introduction {{to the world of}} the McBain films. Excellent." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought the episode was a [...] "fine program", and added that Lovitz made Artie [...] "amusingly annoying". Jacobson thought the episode captured the [...] "tone of the mid-Seventies with warmth and insight", and the courtship [...] "seemed charming but not sappy, and the show worked well overall." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was Grampa's advice to Homer about Marge, [...] "Oh, son, don’t overreach! Go for the dented car, the dead-end job, the less attractive girl!" [...] When Homer arrives at the Bouvier house to pick up Marge for the prom, Selma tells Patty [...] "Marge's dates get homelier all the time," [...] to which Patty replies [...] "That's what you <b>get</b> <b>when</b> you don't put out." [...] Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought these were the best lines of the episode. IGN ranked Lovitz as the eighth best guest star in the show's history.|$|E

[...] Nadia Noir of WNOW-FM wrote, [...] "What do you <b>get</b> <b>when</b> you combine two of pop's best-looking/greatest dancers, the sexy rasp of Justin Bieber, and a dance-jam/love-song? A combination of all the best elements of music!" [...] Nick Levine of BBC Music said the track was part of Brown's identity crisis on the album, as [...] "Next to You" [...] was just two tracks after the [...] "grisly sex jam" [...] of [...] "Wet the Bed" [...] featuring Ludacris. Levine called the collaboration a [...] "wholesome-as-homemade-chutney hook-up." [...] While complementing that the album had [...] "something for everyone", Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called [...] "Next to You" [...] a [...] "puppy-love declaration." [...] Bri LaPelusa called the song a [...] "dreamy ballad" [...] and said it melted Brown and Bieber's [...] "angelic" [...] voices.

The machining efficiency <b>gets</b> higher <b>when</b> diamond wire saw slicing speed and workpiece feed speed increase. These results provide guidance for selecting reasonable parameters in future research...|$|R
