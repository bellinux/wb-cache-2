50|$|According to Saussure, the {{geographic}} study of languages deals with external, not internal, linguistics. <b>Geographical</b> <b>linguistics,</b> Saussure explains, deals primarily {{with the study}} of linguistic diversity across lands, {{of which there are}} two kinds: diversity of relationship, which applies to languages assumed to be related; and absolute diversity, in which case there exists no demonstrable relationship between compared languages. Each type of diversity constitutes a unique problem, and each can be approached in a number of ways.|$|E
5000|$|Tables {{for class}} 8 are fully faceted and details are {{expressed}} through combination with common auxiliaries of language (Table 1c) {{and a series}} of special auxiliary tables to indicate other facets or attributes in Linguistics or Literature. As a result, this class allows for great specificity in indexing although the schedules themselves occupy very little space in UDC. The subdivisions of e.g. 811 Languages or 821 Literature are derived from common auxiliaries of language =1/=9 (Table 1c) by substituting a point for the equals sign, e.g. 811.111 English language (as a subject of a linguistic study) and 821.111 English literature derives from =111 English language. Common auxiliaries of place and time are also frequently used in this class to express place and time facets of Linguistics or Literature, e.g. 821.111(71)"18" [...] English literature of Canada in 19th century 80 General questions relating to both linguistics and literature.

40|$|In this paper, the {{following}} points regarding demonstrative pronoun usage in Shaanxi Province Dialects of Chinese Language will be considered. In particular, those {{points of the}} 3 -way contrast system of demonstrative pronouns expressing distance contrasts present in Chinese Language that are of interest to <b>geographical</b> <b>linguistics</b> will be examined. First of all, the main points of the existing investigations into Shaaxi dialect of Chinese will be pointed out. The data relating to this new study, focusing on the Geographical Distribution and the 3 -way contrast system in that dialect, will then be presented and discussed. First, it will be argued that there in fact {{appears to be the}} complementary distribution between 2 -way and 3 -way contrast system operative in Shaaxi dialect. Second, it will be argued that there in fact appears to be three similar 3 -way contrast systems operative in Shaaxi D.. These systems are; Type I: [Close–Near– Far] (proximal–middle–distal) Type II: [Close–Near– “Farther” (i. e. out of view) ] Type III: [Close–Near–Far–Around? (Outskirts, distal) ] This paper will then look at the currently most prominent theory on Chinese demonstrative pronouns, i. e. that “through the meeting of some differing contrast systems in 2 -way contrast area, a new 3 -way system began to form”. A number of novel suggestions will be put forward. Finally, points for further study will be proposed...|$|E
