40|$|Currently {{a debate}} is ongoing in the Netherlands {{on how to}} {{increase}} soil sustainable management in general and specifically in short term lease. Sustainable practices may not be adopted by farmers because of an interplay between EU, national and provincial legislation, short-term land lease system, and social and economic aspects. Wageningen Plant Research requested students from Wageningen University to research this topic. The purpose of this project {{is to develop a}} Sustainable Soil Management Framework that integrates the legislation, economic and social factors, and Ecosystem Services in order to enable farmers to adopt sustainable soil management practices. Through a literature study key issues were collected on each of the aspects in the framework. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with farmers, land funds, provinces and experts. The interviewees provided additional key issues as well as input to potential solutions to those issues. The main key issues concern the absence of an evaluation and rewarding system of sustainable practices within lease agreements, the (short) <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> agreements, and insufficient knowledge transfer and exchange on soil sustainable management practices between farmers and other stakeholders. Based on these main key issues we propose a set of solutions for each aspect within the Sustainable Soil Management Framework...|$|E
40|$|Since 1990, Poland has {{gradually}} shifted {{the weight of}} its foreign policy orientation toward the West, and in 1998 actually began negotiations to join the EU (European Union). The most significant characteristic of Poland's EU accession negotiations is that {{the manner in which}} candidate countries harmonize their own laws to the EU's "acquis communautaire," the set of treaty obligations and legislation to which all member states must adhere, was discussed. In Poland 27 % of the entire work force is engaged in the agriculture sector and one third of current Polish territory was German territory before World War Two. Therefore, sales of land to foreigners formed a part of the negotiations that caused controversy in Poland. The negotiations revolved around the "transitional arrangements," or how long a time limitation Poland should get on the sales of land. The coalition governments in Poland negotiated not only at the international negotiation table, but also with domestic forces. From the aforementioned reasons, the author of this article uses the "Two-level games" framework, which was outlined by Robert D. Putnam. According to Putnam, the international negotiation process is divided into Level 1 (negotiations at the international table) and Level 2 (negotiations with domestic forces). The author discusses the concepts of "ratification" and "Win-Set" suggested by Putnam, as well as the "preferences of domestic actors," and "the structure of domestic preferences" suggested by Helen V. Milner. Section 1 outlines how the preferences of domestic actors and the structure of domestic preferences influenced the negotiation process, and how ratification and Win-Set were influenced by the preferences of the domestic actors and the structure of domestic preferences. The focus of Section 2 is the background of the political parties' preferences. From 1997 to September 2001, the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) and the Freedom Union (UW) (the UW left the coalition in June 2000) had formed the coalition government, and since October 2001 the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), which had formed an electoral coalition with the Labour Union (UP), together with the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) had become the ruling party. The AWS and the UW have an origin in the Solidarność movement during the 1980 s. However, both forces' preferences are different. Within the AWS, the Christian National Union (ZChN) agreed to the European integration on the condition that long limitation to the liberalization of the sales of land to foreigners is granted. On the other hand, the UW supported the European integration very actively, demanding the reduction of the transitional arrangements. The SLD has its origins in the Polish United Worker's Party (PZPR), which was a ruling party of the communist regime before 1989. The SLD has shown a preference to proceed with the European integration and they prefer shorter limitation on the sales of land. The SLD's constituency is made up from members of trade unions, and from the secular people. Moreover, the SLD has recognized the failure of the economic policy during the 1970 s and 1980 s. The SLD's constituency and these learning effects formed the above preferences. The PSL was named the United Peasant Party (ZSL), a satellite party of the PZPR before 1989, but changed its name to the PSL after merging with other parties. The PSL's constituency is mainly formed by farmers. With time the Polish society recognized the cost of integration to the EU, and the support to join the EU amongst the PSL constituency fell. Therefore, within the PSL there was skepticism towards European integration, while simultaneously recognizing the necessity for the integration. Therefore, the AWS and the PSL have shown similar preferences, and the SLD and the UW have shown similar preferences, regarding the European integration and the sales of land to foreigners. However, the coalition government was formed between the AWS and the UW in 1997, and the next one was formed between the SLD and the PSL in 2001. The paradoxical structure of the combination of the parties forming the coalition government greatly influenced the negotiations. In Chapter 3, the details of the negotiations are analyzed. During screening with the EU in December 1998, Agenda-setting was implemented, and in July 1999, discussions about the length of the transitional arrangements were carried out within the coalition government. The ZChN in the AWS demanded that the limitation must be 18 years. The reason was that they recognized that there is a fear inside the Polish society that foreigners would buy up the cheap land in Poland. The ZChN's proposition became the position of the Polish government, and it remained such until the next general election in the autumn of 2001. The domestic structure of the preference had an overwhelming influence on the decision. The EU side had preferred a shorter limitation on the sales of land than the 18 years, which prevented the realization of the Win-Set during the AWS-UW and the AWS government. After the general election in 2001, another coalition government was formed, composed of the SLD-UP and the PSL. There were three negotiation positions. Some of the opposition parties and some groups within the PSL were opposed to the initial position formed in November 2001 in which the limitation of sales of land was shortened to 12 years, as well as allowing EU farmers to buy agricultural land after 3 years of leasing the land. In the next position of December 2001, Poland demanded from the EU side that the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> be 3 years or 7 years, depending on the region. This position was a result of PSL pressure on the government. Accepting the requirements of Poland in the second position, the EU showed a third position in January 2002. The EU demanded that the counting of the beginning of the lease of the agricultural land be earlier so that EU farmers could buy land in Poland earlier. The PSL was opposed to the EU's position, but after domestic discussions on the third position, the PSL finally accepted the position and the negotiations on the sales of land were closed. The Eurosceptics [Self-Defence (Samoobrona), the League of Polish Families (LPR), the Law and Justice (PiS) ] opposed the entire negotiation process of the Polish government. The most important reason for the realization of the Win-Set is that the domestic structure of preferences in Poland had been changed {{as a result of the}} general election in 2001 and the preferences in Poland came close to those of the EU. The preferences of the SLD-UP had the greatest role in changing the domestic preferences. However, there was a force inside the PSL which opposed the compromise to the EU, therefore the coalition government had to amend the negotiation position and include the demands of the opposition within the PSL into the agreement with the EU. During the AWS-UW government, the negotiation position had been ratified at Level 2, but the negotiations with the EU had failed. There was no Win-Set. Later, Win-Set was realized because of the negotiations of the SLD-UP-PSL government, but the size of Win-Set at Level 2 had been reduced. The negotiations on the agricultural subsidies are not addressed in this article. Poland negotiated more agricultural subsidies than the EU had suggested. This has alleviated the fear of farmers in Poland and it has lead to the widening of the range of the ratification at Level 2, which resulted in the success of the whole negotiation process. This issue will be raised in the next article...|$|E

50|$|Contrary to Roman law, however, {{is that in}} South Africa {{prevails}} the Roman-Dutch {{doctrine of}} huur gaat voor koop (“lease trumps sale”).

Accordingly, the taxpayer reported a capital gain of $9.25 million. The Minister reassessed the taxpayer {{on the ground that}} the entire amount constituted income from a business. The Tax Court of Canada agreed with the Minister and characterized the participation clause as part of an ordinary business contract not forming part of the taxpayer's capital structure. However, the Tax Court decision was overturned on appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. The Federal Court rejected the Minister's position that the participation clause was analogous to an ordinary trade contract. The Federal Court instead characterized the participation clause as an integral part <b>of</b> the <b>lease,</b> which was a capital asset of the taxpayer. The Court held that buy-out of the participation clause had the effect of diminishing the value of this capital asset by $9.25 million. Accordingly, the buy-out amount was on capital account.|$|R
40|$|Balancing {{demand and}} supply {{is at the}} heart of the {{corporate}} real estate planning challenge. Real estate commitments, which are often long-term by nature, are at odds with the quickening competitive environment in which many companies operate today. The “structuring dilemma” is grounded in the uncertainty of a company’s external environment, as well as in the ways the company’s corporate real estate decision-making processes respond to uncertainty. The need for flexibility has seen most companies opt to divest from owning to leasing real estate. However, leasing also does not ensure ultimate flexibility if the <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leases</b> are long and if the lease agreements do not contain options to renew and/or terminate the lease; and expand and/or contract space. Case studies were undertaken at ABB Sverige AB, TietoEnator AB, Siemens AB and Pharmacia AB, to investigate how these companies were matching their corporate real estate (CRE) to their corporate business strategies. The companies had identified real estate as contributing to business profitability. Although only one company had a formulated real estate strategy, they were all pursuing real estate goals to minimise long-term real estate costs and to optimise the use <b>of</b> space. <b>Lease</b> <b>durations</b> were being matched with business projections and options were embedded in the leases for flexibility. However, further investigation in all the companies is needed to evaluate the contribution of real estate to business profitability through measures such as the percentage of real estate costs to total business costs. ...|$|R

5000|$|Rent, Anderson argued, was {{a charge}} {{for the use of}} the more fertile soil. The least fertile soils in {{cultivation}} generated an income that simply covered the costs of production, while the more fertile soils received a [...] "certain premium for an exclusive privilege to cultivate them; which will be greater or smaller according to the more or less fertility of the soil. It is this premium which constitutes what we now call rent; a medium by means of which the expence (sic) of cultivating soils of very different degrees of fertility may be reduced to a perfect quality." [...] For Malthus and Ricardo this differential rent was sourced in the natural productivity of the soil apart from human influence. Anderson, however, insisted that continual improvement of the soil was possible and that the productivity of the least fertile soil could rise to a point that brought it much closer to that of the most fertile land; but also that the converse was true and humans could degrade the soil. Where fertility problems arise in agriculture, for Anderson this was a consequence of the failure to adopt rational and sustainable agricultural practices.
