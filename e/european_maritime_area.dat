40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>area</b> {{is one of}} Europe’s most {{important}} assets with regard to resources, security and ultimately prosperity of the Member States. A significant part of Europe’s economy relies directly or indirectly on it. It {{is not just the}} shipping or fisheries industries and their related activities. It is also shipbuilding and ports, marine equipment and offshore energy, maritime and coastal tourism, aquaculture, submarine telecommunications, blue biotech and the protection of the marine environment. The <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>area</b> faces several risks and threats posed by unlawful activities, such as drugs trafficking, smuggling, illegal immigration, organised crime and terrorism. Piracy in international waters also constitutes a threat to Europe since it can disrupt the maritime transport chain. These risks and threats can endanger human lives, marine resources and the environment, as well as significantly disrupt the transport chain and global and local security. It is anticipated that these risks and threats will endure in the mid and long run. In order to keep Europe as a world leader in the global maritime economy, an effective integrated/interoperable, sustainable maritime surveillance system and situational awareness are needed. A significant number of unlawful maritime activities, such as illegal immigration, drugs trafficking, smuggling, piracy and terrorism involve mainly small boats, because small boats are faster and more difficult to detect using conventional means. Hence, {{it is very important to}} find out the feasibility of using new sensors and platforms, such as SAR or Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) for small boat detection, tracking, classification and identification, as well as to study the potential of airborne SAR for maritime surveillance. Since 2010 the EC-JRC has carried out a number of coupled UAS and spaceborne SAR maritime surveillance campaigns to assess the potential of UAS for maritime surveillance, in particular for small boat detection. This report presents the results and conclusions of the JRC – Metasensing Coupled Spaceborne SAR and Airborne SAR campaign carried out in Feb. 2011 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. JRC.

Although strict limits were introduced recently for the maximum sulfur content in marine fuels in the SECAs (sulfur emission control areas) and in EU ports, sulfur emissions outside the SECAs and emissions of other components in all <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>areas</b> have continued to increase in the last two decades. We have used the air quality model CAMx (Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions) with and without ship emissions for the year 2006 {{to determine the effects of}} international shipping on the annual as well as seasonal concentrations of ozone, primary and secondary components of PM 2. 5, and the dry and wet deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds in Europe.

The largest changes in pollutant concentrations due to ship emissions were predicted for summer. Concentrations of particulate sulfate increased due to ship emissions in the Mediterranean (up to 60  %), the English Channel and the North Sea (30 – 35  %), while increases in particulate nitrate levels were found especially in the north, around the Benelux area (20  %), where there were high NH 3 land-based emissions. Our model results showed that not only are the atmospheric concentrations of pollutants affected by ship emissions, but also depositions of nitrogen and sulfur compounds increase significantly along the shipping routes. NO x emissions from the ships, especially in the English Channel and the North Sea, cause a decrease in the dry deposition of reduced nitrogen at source regions by moving it from the gas phase to the particle phase which then contributes to an increase in the wet deposition at coastal areas with higher precipitation. In the western Mediterranean region, on the other hand, model results show an increase in the deposition of oxidized nitrogen (mostly HNO 3) due to the ship traffic. Dry deposition of SO 2 seems to be significant along the shipping routes, whereas sulfate wet deposition occurs mainly along the Scandinavian and Adriatic coasts. The results presented in this paper suggest that evolution of NO x emissions from ships and land-based NH 3 emissions will play a significant role in future European air quality...|$|R

40|$|The Netherlands is {{geographically}} {{and historically}} highly {{concerned with the}} maritime domain. Major involvement in the Atalanta mission and the BeNeSam cooperation shows the Dutch encouragement to collaborate with other countries when covering the subject of maritime security. The current Dutch EU Presidency is after {{the introduction of the}} EUMSS a good opportunity to see what the Dutch are doing with the issue of maritime security at EU level. Therefore, maritime security on the EU level {{and the role of the}} Netherlands will be the focus of this thesis. This thesis will cover the subject of the increasing interest in maritime security on EU level. The Atalanta mission and the BeNeSam show the Dutch encouragement to collaborate with other countries within the domain of maritime security. Therefore, the topic of this thesis is <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> security and the role of the Netherlands. The research question is; what can the Netherlands ‘upload’ to <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> security cooperation? <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> security is something that is still developing and because of the new focus to maritime security in the EU, this thesis will also look how the Netherlands can shape <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> security cooperation at the moment.

40|$|The {{first ever}} model of {{operational}} collaboration for the <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> industry is presented, built upon the established current state-of-the art in engineering collaboration modelling and addressing key industry requirements. The requirements for operational collaboration {{practices in the}} <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> industry were identified using three approaches: an industrial survey of 69 associations, companies and institutions in the maritime sector; an analysis of prototype collaboration tools; and through an analysis of literature. These requirements were thematically grouped and consolidated where they overlapped, and then translated into model elements and interactions between them. A model that accurately abstracts service and technology collaboration provision between companies {{in a variety of}} collaboration modes was built, and validated against a series of steps that an organisation would need to undertake, to develop a particular mode of collaboration to supports their needs. It was tested in three industrial case studies, providing encouraging feedback demonstrating successful implementation. It provides the opportunity for reassessment of the employed processes and activities, and provides a structure for improving collaborative engineering design. Whilst the research was based in the <b>European</b> <b>maritime</b> industry, the model has wider applicability within the collaborative design of complicated engineering artefacts such as automotive or aerospace...|$|R
