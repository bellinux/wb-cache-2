6000|$|No {{gossip about}} Mr. Casaubon's will had yet reached Ladislaw: the air {{seemed to be}} filled with the {{dissolution}} of Parliament and the coming election, as the old wakes and fairs were filled with the rival clatter of itinerant shows; and more private noises were taken little notice of. The famous [...] "dry election" [...] was at hand, in which the depths of public feeling might be measured by the low <b>flood-mark</b> of drink. Will Ladislaw was one of the busiest at this time; and though Dorothea's widowhood was continually in his thought, he was so far from wishing to be spoken to on the subject, that when Lydgate sought him out to tell him what had passed about the Lowick living, he answered rather waspishly-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Fifteen {{minutes of}} hard {{paddling}} landed us at Selele, a stony point between two sandy baylets: amongst {{the mass of}} angular boulders a tree again showed the highest <b>flood-mark</b> to be 13 feet. Here {{for the first time}} I remarked the black glaze concerning which so much has been written.[FN#28] The colour is a sunburnt black, tinted ferruginous red like meteoric stones, and it is generally friable, crumbling under the nails. It tastes strongly of iron, which flavours almost every spring in the country, yet the most likely places do not show this incrustation. Sometimes it looks like a matrix in which pudding- stone has been imbedded; it may be two or three lines in thickness and it does not colour the inside. At other times it hardly measures the thickness of paper, coating the gneiss slabs like plumbago. Humboldt tells us ("Personal Narrative," [...] ii. 243, Bohn), that the [...] "Indians" [...] of the Atures declare the rocks to be burnt (carbonized) by the sun's rays, and I have often found the same black glaze upon the marly sandstones that alternate with calcareous formations where no stream ever reached them--for instance, on the highlands of Judea, between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea; in inner Istria, and in most countries upon the borders of the Mediterranean.|$|E
6000|$|Below {{the upper}} gate, the bed, now {{narrowing}} to 300 yards, shows the great Yellala; the waters, after breaking into waves for {{a mile and}} a half above, rush down an inclined plane of some thirty feet in 300 yards, spuming, colliding and throwing up foam, which looks dingy white against the dull yellow-brown of the less disturbed channel--the movement is that of waves dashing upon a pier. The bed is broken by the Zunga chya Malemba, which some pronounced Sanga chya Malemba, an oval islet in mid-stream, whose greater diameter is disposed along the axis of the bed. The north-western apex, raised about fifty feet above the present level of the waters, shows a little bay of pure sand, the detritus of its rocks, with a <b>flood-mark</b> fifteen feet high, whilst the opposite side bears a few wind-wrung trees. The materials are gneiss and schist, banded with quartz--Tuckey's great masses of slate. This is the [...] "Terrapin" [...] of the Nzadi. The eastern fork, about 150 yards broad, is a mountain-torrent, coursing unobstructed down its sandy trough, and, viewed from an eminence, the waters of the mid-channel appear convex, a shallow section of a cylinder,--it is a familiar shape well marked upon the St. Lawrence Rapids. The western half is traversed by a reef, connecting the islets with the right bank. During August, this branch was found almost dry; in mid-September, it was nearly full, and here the water breaks with the greatest violence. The right bank is subtended for some hundred yards by blocks of granite and greenstone, pitted with large basins and pot-holes, delicately rounded, turned as with a lathe by the turbid waters. The people declare that this greenstone contains copper, and Professor Smith found particles in his specimens. The Portuguese agents, to whom the natives carefully submit everything curious, doubt the fact, as well as all reports of gold; yet there is no reason why the latter should not be found.|$|E

40|$|The {{location}} for this thesis {{has been the}} river Sagbekken. Sagbekken is a small river in Foldal municipality in Hedmark county in Norway, and it ends it’s journey in lake Butjønna. The river is not directly connected to Glomma, but {{through a couple of}} other streams the water from lake Butjønna meets Glomma in Alvdal. This thesis describes a paleohydrological study of lacustrine sediments. The idea behind this project was to determine wether the conservation-potential of Sagbekken’s flood-signals in lake Butjønna was of good enough quality to make a reconstruction of Sagbekken’s flood-history. Two sediment-cores each 5 m long were taken from the bottom of lake Butjønna. The making of a visual log and loss-on-ignition analysis showed a clear lamination between the mineral flood-signals and the organic matter. Floods of a certain magnitude deposit enough mineral material to create a horizontal layer in the cores. The magnitude of the flood determine how thick the layer is. Altogether 68 flood-layers was recorded from Storofsen in AD 1789 to 9500 BP. Carbon-dating methods was used to determine the age. With such a long time-span it’s easy to see how the flood-regimes have changed from periods with frequent floods to periods without floods at all. A recurrence-interval was estimated for Sagbekken and it was found to be 137 years. This estimation rests on the assumption that a constant sedimentation has taken place in lake Butjønna. The floods have duration from a few hours to a couple of days, and are therefore kept out. The maximum grain-size, the competence, Sagbekken could carry during the spring-flood was estimated with indirectly methods. Observation of <b>flood-marks</b> along the river channel was the basis for a reconstruction of the water surface. With the use of Manning’s formula was the speed, discharge and competence estimated for the spring flood in Sagbekken. The competence was estimated to 4 mm +/- 1 mm, and that fits well with the observations of sand along the river-channel...|$|R
