50|$|Two {{other species}} occur on Mt. Orjen, Iris pseudopallida Trinajstic and Iris reichenbachii var. bosniaca (now {{classified}} as a synonym of Iris spuria,), both with equal chromosome numbers (2n=24), same as Iris orjenii.I. orjenii appears somewhat intermediate, in height of stem, colour of flowers and consistence of spathes. The shape of the tepals is different from I. pseudopallida but {{similar to those of}} I. reichenbachii var. bosniaca. The spathe dries out before or during flowering time, getting white to slightly brownish, sometimes with a violet teint, a diagnostic feature for the whole Pallida series, whereas in I. reichenbachii the spathe is sharpely keeled and stays completely green until flowering period is over. Shape of seed, a character regarded to be of high diagnostic value reveals similarity to those of Iris cengialti and Iris illyrica, both closely related to I. pseudopallida, but striking dissimilarities to the latter, which has compressed seeds. Seeds of I. reichenbachii are described to be similar to those of I. orjenii. Shape and undulation of falls and standards are much more similar to I. reichenbachii, whereas no white flowered individuals from wild population of this species have been reported. White flowering plants of I. pallida from the region of Dubrovnik and white flowering individuals have been spotted occasionally in bigger populations in southern Dalmatia. A hybrid origin of I. orjenii might be suspected, the more as it is found exactly at the height where areals of I. pseudopallida and I. reichenbachii potentially overlap.Thus the closest I. orjenii population was seen only 2 km from a remote I. pseudopallida locality and I. reichenbachii is found in the immediate vicinity of all known stands of I. orjenii. The morphological homogeneity of I. orjenii and the ecological specialisation also favour exclusion of a spontaneous hybrid population hypothesis. I. orjenii is fully fertile and <b>generative</b> <b>propagation</b> in situ has been examined.The new species is restricted to humid chromic luvic cambisols in the high altimediterranean level. The eu- to supramediterranean I. pseudopallida in contrast is widespread on bare limestones or initial rendzic leptosols (Rendzina) in a variety of mediterranean and submediterranean alliances of coastal karst plains, on megacliffs in the Ephedero-Cyxthoselinetum palmoidis alliance and on montane limestone escarpments in the Campanula-Moltkeetum petaeae H-Iċ alliance.I. reichenbachii var. bosniaca and I. orjenii have strong affinities in their phytosociologial character as they are constituents of Festuco-Seslerietea Barbéro & Bonin 1969 with I. reichenbachii var. bosniaca common in Seslerietalia juncifoliae H-at and Crepedetalia dinaricae Lksic. associations on shallow rendzic leptosols of Dinaric high altitudinal limestone pastures and Pinion heldreichii alliances. But ecological differences exist as I. orjenii is never found on extremely shallow soils.Concluding from both morphology and ecology, a hybrid origin followed by speciation seems the best explanation for the restricted occurrence of I. orjenii.|$|E

40|$|The {{sound of}} a {{phonograph}} record's playback is as iconic as it is widespread. The recording is omnipresent. Its presence implies repetition. With the recording's ubiquity has come not just the ubiquitous repetition of those recordings, but the realization of repeated sound as the universal constituent of musical composition. The recording precipitated a paradigm shift {{in the concept of}} repetition. Understood as a motive underlying musical production since long before the captured sound, repetition is a response to a frustration with music's durational nature and an acknowledgement of its limited sonic constitution. Repetition and Mutation All sound involves some element of repetition. Our ears perceive the repetitive propagation of molecules in a transmission medium. In representations of sound, there is necessarily a structural pattern that is <b>generative</b> of this <b>propagation.</b> Sound transmission must involve some element of mutation as well: radio transmission, recording and reproduction, amplification, spatial reverberation, and even projection through the air are mutations that occur universally to sound in its normal course of movement and distribution. Electronic filtering is one esoteric example of mutation. The more fundamenta...|$|R
40|$|Since {{beginning}} of 1990, several projects on biosafety research were initiated in Germany with genetically modified plants. Germany {{was also one}} of the first countries active on biosafety research with genetically modified trees (GMTs). An EU-funded project coordinated by the Institute of Forest Genetics (Johann Heinrich von Thuenen Institute, Grosshansdorf), from 1994 to 1997, was the first project of this kind in Germany. In the frame of this project, transgene stability was studied under greenhouse conditions in different transgenic aspen clones. A high degree of transgene expression stability was found in transgenic lines, however, gene silencing was detected in some transgenic plants. In Germany, the jump of the GMTs from the greenhouse to the field was initiated in 1996 by the Institute of Forest Genetics (Grosshansdorf), when the first field trial with genetically modified (GM) poplar was approved for five years. In the year 2000 and in cooperation with the University of Tuebingen, the same institute established a second field trial with GM poplar to study possible horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from the transgenic poplar into mycorrhizal fungi. No HGT was detected in those studies. Two further national funded projects on phytoremediation and status of mycorrhizal fungi in GMTs under field conditions were run by the University of Freiburg on 2002 - 2004 and 2003 - 2005. Topics of national funded biosafety research projects on GMTs released to the field but as well on greenhouse grown plants were transgene stability, genetic containment, transgene influence on mycorrhizal and phytopathogenic fungi, <b>generative</b> and vegetative <b>propagation</b> capacity, and horizontal gene transfer...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the last}} few decades, changes of {{reproductive}} pattern of polar vascular plants have been observed, for the benefi t of <b>generative</b> <b>propagation.</b> The reasons for this phenomenon are attributed to intensively following climate change, whose effects may be various. Warming causes {{the production of the}} greater number of generative structures, with higher quality. Our macroscopic observations conducted on specimens of polar vascular plants, cultivated in University of Warmia and Mazury greenhouse, indicate that the effect of temperature increase on fl ower development and seed formation is inconsistent. On the other hand enhanced levels of UV-B radiation can negatively affect seedlings. The complexity of the climate change causes tremendous diffi culties in defi ning a clear and unquestioned way of modifi cations during the reproductive phase of the described plants.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of studies carried out on Ptelea trifoliata populations in the Wyszków Forest District in 1998 and 2013. P. trifoliata is a native species of North America (United States of America, northern part of Canada) and has a wide ecological range. However, it prefers fertile, wet soils and moderate light. In Europe, it is planted for its decorative value and is mainly found in synanthropic habitats (parks, graveyards, roadsides, fortifications) in Poland. The station of P. trifoliata is situated in the oak-hornbeam forest, Tilio–Carpinetum typicum, with a significant fraction of the stand consisting of Pinus sylvestris. Hop trees occur mainly along forest section lines and are rarely found inside the sections. In the last 15 years, {{an increase in the number}} and size of P. trifoliata clusters has been observed. The species spreads along forest section lines, which form a convenient migration route by creating favourable conditions for the germination and growth of seedlings (good access to light, fragments of bare soil). The presence of new individuals far from the pre-existing clusters indicates that the <b>generative</b> way of <b>propagation</b> dominates. Biometric measures indicate significant differences in length and width of whole leaves as well as leaflets, with leaves and leaflets of vegetative specimens significantly larger than generative ones. As a consequence of the high rate of P. trifoliata expansion along forest section lines and occurrence of single specimens inside the forest sections, we assume this species to be potentially invasive. The research was financed under the statutory Project No. 65 / 94 /S of the Siedlce University of Natural Sciences and Humanities. Przemysław Szmi...|$|R

40|$|The genetic {{structure}} of remaining black poplar (Populus nigra) {{trees on the}} banks of the Dutch Rhine branches was investigated using the AFLP technique. In total, 143 trees, including one P. deltoides and some P. x euramericana, were analysed using six AFLP primer combinations which generated 319 polymorphic bands. The AFLP patterns showed that some of the trees sampled as P. nigra were clearly different. These deviating patterns were also observed for the P. deltoides tree and all trees already identified as hybrid P. x euramericana. Hybrids between the two species are morphologically sometimes difficult to distinguish from the species itself. Two important possible source populations for recolonization of the riverbanks of the river Rhine, consisting of mature flowering P. nigra trees, appeared to consist of only a few genotypes each. In contrast, young black poplar trees growing alone or in small groups downstream of the possible source populations appeared to be predominantly generatively derived because no clones of mature trees were found among them. Therefore vegetative propagation seems a very local strategy whereas colonization of new areas appears to occur through <b>generative</b> <b>propagation.</b> Whether the genetic diversity within these black poplars is sufficient for recolonization of river banks and survival of the metapopulation is a question for further research...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{directed}} graphical model for label propagation in lengthy and complex video sequences. Given hand-labelled start and end frames {{of a video}} sequence, a variational EM based inference strategy propagates either one of several class labels or assigns an unknown class (void) label to each pixel in the video. These labels are used to train a multi-class classifier. The pixel labels estimated by this classifier are injected back into the Bayesian network for another iteration of label inference. The novel aspect of this iterative scheme, as compared to a recent approach [1], {{is its ability to}} handle occlusions. This is attributed to a hybrid of <b>generative</b> <b>propagation</b> and discriminative classification in a pseudo time-symmetric video model. The end result is a conservative labelling of the video; large parts of the static scene are labelled into known classes, and a void label is assigned to moving objects and remaining parts of the static scene. These labels can be used as ground truth data to learn the static parts of a scene from videos of it or more generally for semantic video segmentation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach using extensive qualitative and quantitative tests over six challenging sequences. We bring out the advantages and drawbacks of our approach, both to encourage its repeatability and motivate future research directions. ...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Natural or {{artificial}} regeneration, rehabilitation, and conversion from coppice to {{high forest}} are important practices in Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) forests in Turkey. Studies {{of the seeds}} of this species have increased in number because mast years are infrequent and seed germination is inhibited by dormancy. In this study we quantified the effects of tree age (40 - 59, 60 - 79 and 80 - 99 years), stand exposure (north, west, east and south) and elevation (600 and 800 m a. s. l.) on seed characteristics (germination, moisture content, and weight) of Oriental beech. Material and Methods: The seeds {{used in this study}} were collected from natural beech forest at Kumluca, Bartin, in the western Black Sea region of Turkey. Experiments were carried out in the laboratory and the greenhouse of Bartin University. Results: Seed germination and moisture content varied significantly by elevation, and seed germination was strongly influenced by elevation. Moisture content was 14 % at 600 m and 16 % at 800 m. The effects of elevation and tree age on 100 seed weights were not significant but exposure had a significant effect. The highest 100 seed weight was recorded for trees on southern exposures and the highest germination percentage of 82 % was recorded for trees on northern exposures. Conclusions: In conclusion, since oriental beech seedlings are produced by <b>generative</b> <b>propagation</b> method, seeds should be harvested in optimum distribution area of beech, from average ages and phenotypically plus tree...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wild}} and in cultivation, sago palm (Metroxylon sagu Rottb.) is mostly {{propagated}} vegetatively through its suckers. <b>Generative</b> <b>propagation</b> occurs to a limited extent; there are strong indications of sago palm being largely an obligatory cross-pollinator. This opens {{the possibility of the}} existence of an endless amount of clonal varieties of sago palm, which is confirmed by the endless amount of different names for locally distinguished varieties in the areas where sago palm occurs naturally. Sago palm's great variability is now threatened by the decrease in area under natural and semi-natural sago forest in the centres of diversity (New Guinea, the Moluccas) and by the sole attention to high-yielding, quickly-maturing varieties for plantation purposes. A comprehensive plan is required for the conservation of the existing germplasm for future selection and breeding. The problems and uncertainties with in-vitro and standing in-situ germplasm collections are such that gathering varieties from {{the wild and}} planting them in special regional germplasm gardens seems the only viable option. Issues of collecting and describing material are dealt with, including the evaluation of information from local informants. Centres of sago palm diversity seem to coincide with centres of language diversity. It is demonstrated, however, that differences in name cannot be attributed singly to differences in language.

Field {{studies were carried out}} in Lower Silesia and Lusatia in southwestern Poland in order to verify the present state of the marginal populations of P. polygonifolius, to determine the habitat preferences of the species in the study area, to compare the ecological data between marginal and central populations and finally to recognise the factors constraining the easternmost limit of the P. polygonifolius. In total, 18 populations were examined, and 11 relevés were collected. The relevés gathered were compared with 95 relevés made in northwestern Germany, and with 10 relevés collected in the German part of Lusatia. There {{were no significant differences between}} the ecology of populations of P. polygonifolius on the eastern edge of its range and those in the central part. P. polygonifolius was found growing both in natural habitats like unspoiled peat bogs, and in anthropogenic habitats such as exploited peat bogs and drainage ditches. In both types of habitats its populations were abundant and competent in terms of <b>generative</b> <b>propagation.</b> The lack of geographical barriers as well as biology and fitness of P. polygonifolius individuals from the study area suggest that marginal populations are possibly a part of a large metapopulation, covering the whole (Polish and German) area of Lusatia, however, this hypothesis was not tested in detail.

40|$|Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) is a {{fast growing}} tree species native to {{temperate}} North America, and widely diffused and naturalized in Europe. It {{is one of}} the candidate species for establishing bioenergy plantations on mar- ginal lands in temperate and sub-Mediterranean regions. This potential is in contrast to its well-known invasive habit, leading to a potential damage to plant biodiversity in many European countries. Advise against black locust plantation in regions where it is already invasive has been issued by several international reports, as well as the adoption of mitigation measures (e. g., “containment” buffer zones) {{to prevent the spread of}} the species into natural and semi-natural habitats. In the Mediterranean basin, however, no studies have been carried out aimed at quantifying the escape rate of black locust saplings from plantation stands and its recruitment into natural habitats, together with the effectiveness of a buffer zone in reducing the spread. In this study we investigated the spread of black locust along 35 transects surround- ing three 20 -year- old plantations and including three different land cover types: abandoned arable land, semi-natural woodland and a buffer zone (orchards) with a low degree of farming input. In addition, the effect of soil disturbance on seed propagation was investigated. Our results demonstrate that the density of black locust regeneration is strongly affected by the land cover, abandoned agricultural land being the most prone to black locust colo- nization. Contrastingly, the spread was minimal in the buffer zone and negligi- ble in semi-natural woodland. During the investigated year, seed <b>generative</b> <b>propagation</b> was also negligible. The semi-natural woodland seems to resist well to black locust invasion, though further observations are needed to assess the consequences of stand harvesting disturbance as well, according to local standard forest management. Buffer zones seem to be very effective in con- trolling black locust invasion. Best management practices, with active farming inputs, are also discussed...|$|E
