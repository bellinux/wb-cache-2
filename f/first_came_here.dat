6000|$|... "Yes, I've seen them. At least, I {{saw them}} when we <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here.</b> They hung around for a while, {{watching}} us, then after a time they disappeared." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I made no comment. He's {{known for}} his liberality and his bad luck at the game of monte, which keeps him as poor as when he <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No, madame, I {{have heard}} nothing {{of him for}} many months; not, indeed, since his lugger <b>first</b> <b>came</b> down <b>here,</b> with his letter and the deed of her sale to myself. Did you expect to find him here?" ...|$|R

60|$|VIOLET. [conversationally] Yes. We {{intended}} {{to go to}} Nice; {{but we had to}} follow a rather eccentric member of our party who started <b>first</b> and <b>came</b> <b>here.</b> Won't you sit down? [She clears the nearest chair of the two books on it].|$|R
6000|$|... "When we <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> I didn't {{think she}} 'mounted to very much, 'cause {{she was so}} little an' kind er dried up. Then, when she struck out so heavy prayin', I begun to think {{there might be more}} to her than I'd counted on. But now,--why, Joe, little as she is, aunt Dorcas has done more'n all the cops in town put together.

6000|$|... "No," [...] she admitted, [...] "you haven't. You made {{no claim}} on me, as, perhaps, you were {{entitled}} to do, when you <b>first</b> <b>came</b> out <b>here.</b> In fact, I have once or twice felt slightly vexed with you because you went to Mrs. Farquhar." ...|$|R
