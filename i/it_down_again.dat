25|$|Meanwhile, the Māori {{in the far}} North, {{around the}} Bay of Islands, {{who had been the}} first to sign the Treaty of Waitangi, were feeling {{increasingly}} sidelined and resentful of the changes that had taken place in New Zealand. To signal their resentment, Hone Heke cut down the flagpole at Kororareka. Rather than address the problems, FitzRoy had the flagpole re-erected. Hone Heke cut <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>again,</b> four times altogether; by the fourth occasion the First New Zealand War, sometimes called the Flagstaff War or the Northern War, was well under way.|$|E
25|$|For safety, train {{formations}} {{consist of}} one locomotive pushing a single carriage {{up the mountain}} and leading <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>again</b> while the locomotive brakes allow a controlled descent. (On opening, the usual practice {{was to have a}} locomotive pushing two coaches; this was changed in 1923.) The carriage is not coupled to the locomotive, as gravity keeps the two in contact, although an electric cable is run between the locomotive and the carriage, which enables a buzzer to be used to signal between the driver and the guard. The cable is designed to pull free if the locomotive and carriage separate. Not being coupled prevents a carriage being dragged down the mountain if a locomotive derailed, as happened in the opening day accident.|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Ridley Scott {{revealed}} he {{was planning}} two sequels to Prometheus, which would lead into the first Alien film, adding, [...] "Maybe [...] even [...] a fourth film before we {{get back into the}} Alien franchise." [...] In November 2015, Scott confirmed that Alien: Covenant would be the first of three additional films in the Alien prequels series, before linking up with the original Alien and stated that the Prometheus sequels would reveal who created the xenomorph aliens. The screenplay for the third prequel film, called Alien: Awakening, was written during production of Alien: Covenant and was finished in 2017, with production scheduled to begin in 2018. In March 2017, Scott said, ”If you really want a franchise, i can keep cranking it for another six. I'm not going to close <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>again.</b> No way." ...|$|E

500|$|After Roosevelt's {{hand-picked}} successor as president, former Secretary of War William Howard Taft, {{was inaugurated}} in March 1909, Congress battled over {{what became the}} Payne–Aldrich Tariff. [...] At the time, tariffs were {{the main source of}} government revenue, and conflicts over them were passionate. The party platform had promised tariff reform, which progressive insurgents like Borah took to mean tariff reductions. Old Guard legislators like Senator Aldrich disagreed, and the final version actually raised rates by about one percent. The battles alienated Borah from Taft, who in a speech at Winona, Minnesota described the new law as the best tariff the country had ever had. Borah and other progressives had proposed an income tax to be attached to the tariff bill; when this was unacceptable to Taft, who feared the Supreme Court would strike <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>again,</b> Borah repackaged it as a constitutional amendment, which passed the Senate unanimously and then the House, and to the surprise of many passed the requisite number of state legislatures by 1913 to become the Sixteenth Amendment. [...] Borah also had a hand in the other constitutional amendment to be ratified in 1913, the Seventeenth Amendment, providing for the direct election of senators by the people. In 1909, due to Borah's influence, the Idaho Legislature passed an act for a statewide election for senator with legislators in theory bound to choose the winner, and by 1912 over 30 states had similar laws. Borah promoted the amendment in the Senate in 1911 and 1912 until it passed Congress and after a year was ratified by the states. [...] With the power to elect senators having passed to the people, according to McKenna, the popular Borah [...] "secured for himself a life option on a seat in the Senate".|$|E
2500|$|McGoohan was one {{of several}} actors {{considered}} for the role of James Bond in Dr. No. [...] While McGoohan, a Catholic, turned down the role on moral grounds, the success of the Bond films is generally cited as the reason for Danger Man being revived.
