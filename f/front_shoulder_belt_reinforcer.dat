25|$|In 1966, Cadillac had {{its best}} annual sales yet, over 192,000 units (142,190 of them de Villes), an {{increase}} of more than 60%. This was exceeded in 1968, when Cadillac topped 200,000 units for the first time. 1967 and 1968 saw {{the introduction of a}} host of federally mandated safety features, including energy-absorbing steering columns and wheels, soft interior and instrument panel knobs and surfaces, <b>front</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts,</b> and side marker lights.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989 saw {{a subtle}} {{change in the}} body style of the Sentra coupe and sedan, as new larger, more rounded front corner lights were {{introduced}} to the front fenders and redesigned taillights were added to the rear fascia (station wagon retained same rear lights). The Nissan logo on the front grille was relocated from the right hand side to the center. In 1990, electrically retracted <b>front</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> were added, as well as 3-point harnesses for the rear passengers, excluding the center rear passenger.|$|R
2500|$|For the 1968 model, the {{horizontal}} division bar {{was removed from}} the grille. A fine cross hatched insert was framed by a segmented chrome surround. Model nameplates were moved from the rear fender to the front fender. The , [...] V8 was a Valiant option for the first time. [...] All North American Chrysler products got front and rear side marker lights, amber in front, red in the rear. [...] These were round in shape, surrounded by an attractive chrome bezel.

Continuing the tradition of minimal changes, the models received a new [...] "suspended" [...] accelerator pedal and cable throttle linkage. Additional safety equipment for the 1969 models included <b>front</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> and headrests for both front outboard seating positions and the front parking lights stayed on with the headlights. On the exterior, the center horizontal chrome grille bar was deleted.|$|R
25|$|Like all 1968 {{passenger}} vehicles {{sold in the}} United States, GTOs now featured <b>front</b> outboard <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> (cars built after January 1, 1968) and side marker lights. To comply with the new 1968 federal vehicle emissions standards, the GTO was now equipped with emissions controls.|$|R
5000|$|The 1991 {{facelift}} included revised grill, headlights, turn signals, badges, and hubcaps - {{as well as}} {{reduction of}} towing hooks to two from four. Later North American models featured [...] "automatic" [...] non-motorized <b>front</b> seat <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> along with a knee-bar and manual front lap belts.|$|R
25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked {{much in the way of}} trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, and <b>front</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|R
50|$|The 1967 LTD two-door hardtop {{got a new}} formal roofline, {{keeping up}} with the competition. All models {{received}} the 1967 federally-mandated safety features, including an energy-absorbing steering column and wheel, non-protruding instrument panel knobs, a dual-circuit brake master cylinder, four-way hazard flashers, and <b>front</b> outboard <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> mounting points.|$|R
25|$|For 1967 all Fords {{featured}} a large, padded hub {{in the center}} of the plastic steering wheel, along with an energy-absorbing steering column (introduced late into the 1967 model year), padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and <b>front</b> outboard <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> anchors. Another safety related change was the introduction of the dual brake master cylinder used on all subsequent Galaxies (and other Ford models).|$|R
50|$|For 1968, Catalinas {{and other}} {{full-sized}} Pontiacs received a minor facelifting of the '67 {{body with a}} new beak-nose split grille along with a reverting to horizontal headlights, and revised taillights. Engine offerings were similar to 1967 with revised horsepower ratings including 340 for the four-barrel 400, 375 for the 428 four-barrel and 390 for the 428 HO. Safety continued to be key in 1968 with new fender side-marker lights becoming standard. Cars built after January 1, 1968 included <b>front</b> outboard <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> as standard equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The 1968 {{model year}} {{included}} federally-mandated {{side marker lights}} and <b>front</b> outboard <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> (sash <b>belt,</b> <b>shoulder</b> harness) among some minor changes. A [...] 302 cuin L two-barrel V8 was the base engine on all XR-7s and early standard Cougars. Three new engines {{were added to the}} option list this year: the [...] 302 cuin L, four-barrel V8; the [...] 428 cuin L, four-barrel V8; and the [...] 427 cuin L, four-barrel V8. In addition, the 289 cuin L engine was made standard on base cars without the interior decor group midway through the model year.|$|R
50|$|This {{generation}} was introduced with covered headlights {{on the top}} level LTD coupe, sedan and station wagon, which were deployed using a vacuum canister system that kept the doors down when a vacuum condition existed in the lines, provided by the engine when it was running. If a loss of vacuum occurred, the doors would retract up so that the headlights were visible if the system should fail. 1968s also included side marker lights and reflectors, and the parking lights now illuminated with the headlights. <b>Front</b> outboard <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> were fitted to cars built effective January 1, 1968.|$|R
5000|$|... 1960 saw {{the third}} major {{revision}} to the 92's platform in the Saab 96. The 96 {{was an important}} model for Saab: {{it was the first}} Saab to be widely exported out of Sweden. The unusual vehicle proved very popular, selling nearly 550,000 examples. Unlike American cars of the day, the 93, 95 and 96 all featured the 3-cylinder 2-cycle engine, which required adding oil to the gasoline tank, front-wheel drive, and freewheeling, which allowed the driver to downshift the on-the-column manual shifter without using the clutch. <b>Front</b> seat <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> were also an early feature.|$|R
50|$|During this generation, {{a number}} of running changes were made to {{accommodate}} changing federal safety regulations. For 1966, seat belts became standard equipment for all seats (front and rear). For 1967, the changes were more extensive, as the Country Squire redesigned the steering wheel (with a large, padded hub in the center) fitted to an energy-absorbing steering column,28 padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and <b>front</b> outboard <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> anchors. To ensure that the 4300-lb Country Squire {{would not be the}} victim of brake failure, another mandate required the introduction of a dual-chamber master cylinder (on the Country Squire and all other 1968 vehicles).|$|R
5000|$|For 1965, Chrysler {{moved the}} Polara {{back to a}} Chrysler [...] "C" [...] fullsize {{platform}} that was shared with Chrysler and Plymouth models. Once again offered in {{a full range of}} bodies (sedans, hardtops, station wagons, etc.), the Polara, in effect, replaced the 880 and remained a step below the Custom 880, and the new Monaco hardtop coupe was now Dodge's top model. The previous mid-sized Dodges that were sold under the names Polara 500, Polara, 440, and 330 continued in production under the name Dodge Coronet, their wheelbase shrinking to 117 in. These Polaras were criticized for low fuel economy, with some configurations going only 12 miles on a gallon of gasoline. In the 1966 model year, the Monaco would replace the Custom 880 as the mid-level model while a new Monaco 500 would replace the previous 1965 Monaco. 1967 models received a facelift and the hardtop coupe adopted a semi-fastback roof style with a reverse-slant rear quarter window. 1967 models also saw a new U.S. Government-required safety package that included an energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, blunt dashboard controls, more interior padding, and a dual-circuit brake master cylinder. 1968s got outboard <b>front</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> and side marker lights in addition to the '67 safety equipment.|$|R
50|$|All {{standard}} 1968 4-4-2 {{engines are}} painted a bronze-copper color, {{as with the}} 1967s, topped with a fire-red air cleaner. W-30 option cars were equipped with Ram Air intake hoses leading from a chrome-topped dual snorkel black air cleaner to special under-bumper air scoops and set off by bright red plastic fender wells. In addition, a Turnpike Cruiser option was made available with a two-barrel carburetor; this was previously available on the Cutlass Supreme for 1967. 1968 was the first year for side marker lights and <b>front</b> outboard <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts,</b> and {{the last year for}} vent windows on hardtops and convertibles. 4-4-2s for '68 had unique rear bumpers, with exhaust cutouts and special exhaust tips.|$|R
5000|$|The Custom Cruiser was restyled in 1980 with a {{lower front}} fascia. The doors and window {{mechanisms}} were also redesigned to be lighter. The woodgrained side panels on models so equipped no longer followed the curves of the wheel wells like the 1977-1979 versions, but were positioned higher on the body sides to give a straighter, sleeker look similar to the first generation. 1980 saw the last restyling of the second generation Custom Cruisers.Minor mechanical changes were made between 1980 and 1990. The new E4ME electronic carburetor which used GM's CCC (Computer Command Control) system was introduced in 1980 for models sold in California. In 1981, all Custom Cruisers used the E4ME with the CCC system, although Canadian emission cars continued to use the mechanical M4ME carburetor until 1986. Also new in 1981 was GM's new Turbo Hydramatic 200-4R automatic transmission with overdrive. This transmission was equipped with a lock-up torque converter and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio. With the new transmission, the Custom Cruiser could be equipped with a numerically higher rear axle ratio for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range. 1985 saw major changes to the 5.0 L (307 CID) V8 engine's cylinder head design. Introduced were new [...] "swirl port" [...] heads, which improved driveability and low-end torque. These new heads also featured very small intake ports, which reduced the higher RPM power and performance significantly. Along with the new heads, roller lifters replaced flat lifters. The 1989 Custom Cruiser was the last edition to have <b>front</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> mounted in the B-pillars; 1990 introduced door-mounted [...] "passive" [...] <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts.</b>|$|R

Notably new in 2001 were the three-point seatbelts for all five seating positions, including force limiters in <b>front</b> and height-adjustable <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> anchors for <b>front</b> and rear outboard positions, plus rear seat headrests for all three seating positions.|$|R
5000|$|The USA Legacy was {{introduced}} with three trim levels: the Standard, the [...] "L," [...] and the [...] "LS." [...] In 1991, the Standard was removed and the [...] "LSi" [...] {{was introduced}} as an [...] "LS" [...] with gray leather interior on the sedan only, {{similar to the}} [...] "Gala" [...] and [...] "Heritage" [...] approach internationally. The USA-spec Standard was {{very similar to the}} Euro-spec DL and the Japanese-spec Ei, with a very sparse level of equipment. The 1990 models can be distinguished from the 1991 models by the color of the rub strip that encompasses the vehicle; 1990 the color was gray and 1991 the color was black. Also, the color of the automatic <b>front</b> seat <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> latch was interior color for 1990 and black for 1991 and subsequent years. For MY 1991, the [...] "L" [...] trim level was available with a Value Plus option package, which included anti-lock brakes, power windows, central locking, air conditioning, cruise control, and the 80W stereo.|$|R
2500|$|The 1967 Caprice {{received}} a restyling with more rounded body lines and revised grilles and taillights, optional front fender corner lamps which illuminated with the headlamps, {{as well as}} a revised instrument panel with round instruments and a new steering wheel.

40|$|The use of {{automatic}} safety belts among motorists {{throughout the state}} of Michigan was examined in May 1990 {{as part of a}} broader direct-observation survey to measure compliance with Michigan's mandatory safety belt use law. Use of the two most common types {{of automatic}} belt systems were measured: the nonmotorized detachable three-point lap and <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> system and the motorized <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> with manual lap belt system. A total of 828 drivers and 237 front-right passengers were observed with automatic belt systems between April 30, 1990 and May 24, 1990. Use of nonmotorized detachable three-point lap and <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> systems was 74. 3 %. Lap belt use of motorized shoulder and manual lap belt systems was 79. 2 %.

40|$|Lap and <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> {{have been}} {{required}} in rear outboard positions since 1989. A recent congressional mandate encouraged the requirement of a lap and <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> in the center rear seat position. This study utilized Data from the Partners for Child Passenger Safety study, a large-scale child-focused crash surveillance system, to quantify changes in seating patterns for children in vehicles that already have this feature compared to those which do not and measured the safety benefit associated with the provision of a <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> in the center rear seat position. The data demonstrate {{that the presence of}} a <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> in the center rear seating position influences seating practices only when there is a single child occupant in the vehicle. Belted children in the center rear of vehicles equipped with a lap <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> are at an 81 % reduction in risk of injury than those belted in the center rear equipped with a lap only belt. The data suggest that by requiring lap <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> in the center rear, benefits would be realized to belted children, specifically the 4 – 8 year old group...|$|R
50|$|All Legacy wagons sold in Europe {{came with}} rear seat {{headrests}} and 3-point outboard position lap and <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> as standard equipment, whereas rear headrests were available on upper trim levels elsewhere.

50|$|Because of {{tightening}} auto {{safety regulations}} from the NHTSA, all 1990 and 1991 Accords {{sold in the}} United States came equipped with motorized <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> for <b>front</b> passengers to comply with passive restraint mandates. These semi-automatic restraints were a two component system; a motorized <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> along with a non-integrated and manually operated seatbelt. The <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> automatically raced around each window frame encircling both the driver and front seat passenger whenever the front door closed.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} to quantify the effects of belt-positioning boosters on lap and <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> fit. Postures and belt fit were measured for forty-four boys and girls ages 5 to 12 in four highback boosters, one backless booster, and on a vehicle seat without a booster. Belt anchorage locations were varied over a wide range. Seat cushion angle, seat back angle, and seat cushion length were varied in the no-booster conditions. All boosters produced better mean lap belt fit than was observed in the no-booster condition, but the differences among boosters were relatively large. With one midrange belt configuration, the lap belt was not fully below the anterior-superior iliac spine (ASIS) landmark {{on the front of the}} pelvis for 89 % of children in one booster, and 75 % of children failed to achieve that level of belt fit in another. In contrast, the lap belt was fully below the ASIS for all but two children in the best-performing booster. Child body size had a statistically significant but relatively small effect on lap belt fit. The largest children sitting without a booster had approximately the same lap belt fit as the smallest children experienced in the worst-performing booster. Increasing lap belt angle relative to horizontal produced significantly better lap belt fit in the no-booster condition, but the boosters isolated the children from the effects of lap belt angles. Reducing seat cushion length in the no-booster condition improved lap belt fit but changing cushion angle did not. Belt upper anchorage (D-ring) location had a strong effect on <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> fit in conditions without <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> routing from the booster. Unexpectedly, the worst average <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> fit was observed in one highback booster with a poorly positioned <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> routing clip. The <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> was routed more outboard, on average, with a backless booster than without a booster, but raising the child also amplified the effect of D-ring location, such that children were more likely to experience poor <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> fit due to outboard and forward D-ring locations when sitting on the booster. Taller children experienced more-outboard <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> fit in conditions without <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> routing by the booster and in the one booster with poor <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> routing. Adjustable <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> routing on three of the highback boosters effectively eliminated stature effects, providing approximately the same <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> fit for all children. Seat back angle did not have a significant effect on <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> fit. The belt fit was measured in each test condition using the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid-III ATDs. ATD belt fit was strongly correlated with child belt fit across test conditions, but offsets between the ATD and child belt fit scores were observed due to anatomical and postural differences between the ATDs and children. The results of this study have broad applicability toward the improvement of occupant restraints for children. The data show substantial effects of booster design on belt fit, particularly the effects of alternative lap and torso belt routing approaches. Regression analyses quantify the critical importance of belt anchorage location for child belt fit, providing an important foundation for efforts to optimize belt geometry for children. The strong correlation between ATD and child belt fit scores means that ATD-based measurements can reliably be used to assess booster and vehicle designs with respect to child belt fit...|$|R
