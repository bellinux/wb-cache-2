40|$|Delegation {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{as an essential}} element of effective management in North American organisations; however, delegation may not be effective in other countries where employees hold different cultural values. We suggest that Chinese cultural values are inconsistent with <b>delegation,</b> <b>and</b> as such we develop a model in which organisation support mediates the relationship between <b>delegation</b> <b>and,</b> subordinate job satisfaction and performance in the Chinese context. Our sample comprised 136 Chinese subordinates working in a large transport company in Hong Kong. Our results show that organisation support partially mediates between <b>delegation</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction while organisation support (with job satisfaction) fully mediates between <b>delegation</b> <b>and</b> subordinate performance. Implications for the theory <b>and</b> practice of <b>delegation</b> are discussed, particularly in the context of employees' national cultural differences...|$|R
