5000|$|The {{mutation}} of Dally is {{a consequence}} of the P-element and the place where it is located. It is possible to differentiate between the mutants Dally-P1 and Dally-P2, depending on where the insertion of P-element is. It is known that Dally-P2 generates a bigger amount of defects. This mutated Dally disrupts the cell cycle progression, delaying the process during the G2-mitosis transition. As a matter of fact, mutations affecting Dally disrupt patterning of many tissues, for instance of the nervous system. [...] Dally mutants <b>display</b> <b>cell</b> cycle progression defects in specific sets of dividing cells. Those mutations are pleiotropic and can affect viability and produce morphological defects in several adult tissues, such as the eye, antenna, wing and genitalia.|$|E

The challenge {{is to develop a}} method {{that can be used for}} estimating the composition of a single <b>display</b> <b>cell</b> on the basis of the collected three-dimensional Raman spectra. A classical least squares (CLS) model is used to model the measured spectra.

For each data set the type and amount of preprocessing may be different. This is shown using two data sets measured on essentially the same type of <b>display</b> <b>cell,</b> but under different experimental conditions. For model validation three criteria are introduced: mean sum of squares of residuals, percentage of unexplained information (PUN), and average residual curve.

40|$|In this Thesis, {{systems of}} {{confined}} and flexoelectric liquid crystal {{systems have been}} studied using molecular computer simulations. The aim of this work {{was to provide a}} molecular model of a bistable <b>display</b> <b>cell</b> in which switching is induced through the application of directional electric field pulses. In {{the first part of this}} Thesis, the study of confined systems of liquid crystalline particles has been addressed. Computation of the anchoring phase diagrams for three different surface interaction models showed that the hard needle wall and rod-surface potentials induce both planar and homeotropic alignment separated by a bistability region, this being stronger and wider for the rod-surface varant. The results obtained using the rod-sphere surface model, in contrast, showed that tilled surface arrangements can be induced by surface absorption mechanisms. Equivalent studies of hybrid anchored systems showed that a bend director structure can be obtained in a slab with monostable homeotropic anchoring at the top surface and bistable anchoring at the bottom, provided that the slab height is sufficiently large and the top homeotropic anchoring is not too strong. In the second part of the Thesis, the development of models for tapered (pear-shaped) mesogens has been addressed. The first model considered, the truncated Stone expansion model, proved to be unsuccessful in that it did not display liquid crystalline phases. This drawback was then overcome using the alternative parametric hard Gaussian overlap model which was found to display a much richer phase behaviour. With a molecular elongation k = 5, both nematic and interdigitated smectic A sub 2 phases were obtained. In the final part of this Thesis, the knowledge acquired from the two previous studies was united in an attempt to model a bistable <b>display</b> <b>cell.</b> Switching between the hybrid aligned nematic and vertical states of the cell was successfully performed using pear shaped particles with both dielectric gs to an applied field. Also, a parameter window was identified, for values of the electric field, dielectric susceptibility and dipole moment, for which directional switching is achievable between the bistable states...|$|E

30|$|The {{change in}} the {{appearance}} of a pixel of the EPDs is solely due to the change of the position of the pigments within the suspension. Thus, the pigments play a vital role on the speed and efficiency of the EPDs. For a white/black <b>display</b> <b>cell,</b> the white particles are typically titanium oxide because of its relatively high refractive index of 2.7, which leads to excellent scattering properties [14]. Generally, carbon black is the material of choice to produce the black color in most applications. However, carbon black has a complex and poorly understood surface chemistry, which may vary widely with the specific raw material and the exact process used for the carbon black production. Furthermore, carbon black has a poorly understood aggregate, fractal structure. It has also been discovered that carbon black has a low density (0.8 g/cm 3), which is not matched to that of the usual suspending medium (about 1.7 g/cm 3) [15]. There is thus a need for black particle with proper density and surface chemistry for used in EPDs that can be compatible with the suspending fluid.|$|E
