50|$|<b>Echinotriton</b> <b>andersoni</b> is uncommon, {{and it is}} {{threatened}} by habitat loss and by collection for illegal pet trade.|$|E
50|$|Anderson's {{crocodile}} newt, Anderson's newt, Ryukyu spiny newt, or Japanese {{warty newt}} (<b>Echinotriton</b> <b>andersoni)</b> is {{a species of}} salamander in the Salamandridae family found in the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, and, at least formerly, Mount Guanyin in northern Taiwan, {{where it is now}} believed to be extinct.|$|E
50|$|<b>Echinotriton</b> <b>andersoni</b> is a stout, flat salamander. Head {{is broad}} and {{triangular}} in shape. There are 12-15 conspicuous knob-like lateral glands. Colouration is uniformly dark brown or black, only {{the underside of}} the tail, cloacal region, and the soles of the feet are yellow-orange. The maximum size is at least 80 mm in snout-vent length and 169 mm in total length.|$|E
40|$|We {{observed}} male courtship {{behavior of}} Tylototriton (<b>Echinotriton)</b> <b>andersoni</b> in the laboratory. In some males, the cloaca swelled and became wet with mucous secretions from December to May. A male {{in this condition}} crept around a female, sniffing around her body and drawing a thread of mucus from his cloaca, so that the female was surrounded by spiderweb-like string of mucous attached to the substrate. The male then deposited a spermatophore by rubbing his cloaca against the substratum while swaying his body to and fro. The male behaved similarly towards females from different localities, though we could not observe any female reaction to the male. Under a phase-contrast microscope, the gross morphology of sperms from a male from Amamioshima Island {{was similar to that}} reported for males from Okinawajima...|$|E
40|$|Anderson’s {{crocodile}} newt (<b>Echinotriton</b> <b>andersoni)</b> {{is distributed}} in the Central Ryukyu Islands of southern Japan, but environmental degradation and illegal collection {{over the last several}} decades have devastated the local populations. It has therefore been listed as a class B 1 endangered species in the IUCN Red List, indicating that it is at high risk of extinction in the wild. The species is also protected by law in both Okinawa and Kagoshima prefectures. An artificial insemination technique using hormonal injections could not be applied to the breeding of this species in the laboratory. In this study we naturally bred the species, and tested a laboratory farming technique using several male and female E. andersoni pairs collected from Okinawa, Amami, and Tokunoshima Islands and subsequently maintained in near-biotopic breeding cages. Among 378 eggs derived from 17 females, 319 (84. 4 %) became normal tailbud embryos, 274 (72. 5 %) hatched normally, 213 (56. 3 %) metamorphosed normally, and 141 (37. 3 %) became normal two-month-old newts; in addition, 77 one- to three-year-old Tokunoshima newts and 32 Amami larvae are currently still growing normally. Over the last five breeding seasons, eggs were laid in-cage on slopes near the waterfront. Larvae were raised in nets maintained in a temperature-controlled water bath at 20 °C and fed live Tubifex. Metamorphosed newts were transferred to plastic containers containing wet sponges kept in a temperature-controlled incubator at 22. 5 °C and fed a cricket diet to promote healthy growth. This is the first published report of successfully propagating an endangered species by using breeding cages in a laboratory setting for captive breeding. Our findings on the natural breeding and raising of larvae and adults are useful in breeding this endangered species and {{can be applied to the}} preservation of other similarly wild and endangered species such as E. chinhaiensis...|$|E
