"Yoda" [...] was {{originally}} written by [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic {{during the initial}} run of the second Star Wars movie, the 1980 American epic space opera The Empire Strikes Back. The film introduced the character of Yoda, the ancient Jedi Master who trains Luke {{in the ways of}} The Force following the demise of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Yankovic later jokingly said that, [...] "Prior to The Empire Strikes Back, the thought of writing a song about Yoda had never occurred to me." [...] He {{toyed with the idea of}} writing a song based on the break-out character, but was unable to find a suitable piece to parody until one of his friends proposed that he use [...] "Lola"—"which I couldn't believe that I hadn't thought of myself, since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> huge Kinks fan." ...|$|E
500|$|On February21,1985, Yankovic began {{recording}} the parodies for Dare to Be Stupid. The first parody recorded for {{the album was}} [...] "Yoda". [...] "Yoda" [...] was originally written by Yankovic during the initial run of the 1980 American film The Empire Strikes Back. After {{the success of the}} movie, Yankovic {{toyed with the idea of}} writing a song based on the break-out character, but was unable to find a suitable song to use as the base. Yankovic remembers, [...] "I was still in college at the time, and a friend of mine named Mike suggested that I do the song to the tune of 'Lola'—which I couldn't believe that I hadn't thought of myself, since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> huge Kinks fan." [...] Yankovic wrote and recorded a version of the song, using only an accordion, on a four-track cassette Portastudio. This version of [...] "Yoda" [...] was a hit on the [...] "Dr. Demento Show", and even managed to hit, and hold onto, number one on the Funny Five countdown for several weeks. This early demo was later released on the sixth volume of Dr. Demento's Basement Tapes.|$|E

"The Bunins are direct {{ancestors}} of Simeon Bunkovsky, a nobleman {{who came from}} Poland {{to the court of}} the Great Prince Vasily Vasilyevich," [...] he wrote in 1915, quoting the Russian gentry's Armorial Book. Chubarovs, according to Bunin, [...] "knew very little about themselves except that their ancestors were landowners in Kostromskaya, Moskovskaya, Orlovskya and Tambovskaya Guberniyas". [...] "As for me, from early childhood <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> libertine as to be totally indifferent both to my own 'high blood' and to the loss of whatever might have been connected to it," [...] he added.|$|E
2500|$|The band went by {{the name}} [...] "Feedback" [...] for a few months, before {{changing}} to [...] "The Hype" [...] later on. After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band, the Virgin Prunes, the remaining four officially changed the name from [...] "The Hype" [...] to [...] "U2". Initially Bono sang, played guitar and wrote the band's songs. He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview, [...] "When we started out I was the guitar player, along with the Edge—except I couldn't play guitar. I still can't. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me that maybe I should sing instead. I had tried before, but I had no voice at all. I remember the day I found I could sing. I said, 'Oh, that's how you do it.'" [...] When The Edge's guitar playing improved, Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone, although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica. As of 2006, Bono has taken piano lessons from his children's piano teacher {{as a means to}} improve his songwriting.|$|E
