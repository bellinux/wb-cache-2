5|$|Love in Several Masques is a play by Henry Fielding {{that was}} first {{performed}} on 16 February 1728 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The moderately received play comically depicts three lovers trying {{to pursue their}} individual beloveds. The beloveds require their lovers to meet their various demands, {{which serves as a}} means for Fielding to introduce his personal <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> morality and virtue. In addition, Fielding introduces criticism of women and society in general.|$|E
5|$|The band began {{composing}} {{new songs}} in 2011, {{and had the}} album's first recording sessions in early 2012 before the musicians {{decided to take a}} break. As all the band members got into side projects afterwards, work on Lightning Bolt only resumed in March 2013. The music for Lightning Bolt has a harder rock sound with longer songs to contrast predecessor Backspacer (2009), and the lyrics convey singer Eddie Vedder's <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> aging and mortality.|$|E
5|$|There {{also exist}} hatt-ı hümayuns expressing the sultan's {{opinions}} or even his <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> certain matters. For example, after the successful defense of Mosul against {{the forces of}} Nadir Shah, in 1743, Sultan Mahmud I sent a hatt-ı hümayun to the governor Haj Husayn Pasha, which praised in verse the heroic exploits of the governor and the warriors of Mosul.|$|E

5|$|FutureSex/LoveSounds is {{the second}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Justin Timberlake. It was released on September 8, 2006 by Jive Records and its affiliated label of the Zomba Group of Companies. During a two-year hiatus, Timberlake resolved his <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> being unable to record any new material, and as he returned to record some new music, he began collaborating with his longtime record producer Timbaland, alongside the latter's colleague Danja. The album's contents were produced at Timbaland's Thomas Crown Studios. The album shares some lyrical themes with Timberlake's debut album Justified (2002), although FutureSex/LoveSounds has more diversity in music genres. It infuses R and pop with techno, funk, and elements of rock. The reprises and interludes interspersed on the album's tracks were created by the production team {{with the goal of}} channeling Timberlake's influences; including David Bowie and Prince.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{grew up in}} a well-to-do and {{politically}} connected progressive family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience and firmly held religious ideals. She married George Butler, an Anglican divine and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a bannister. The death was a turning point for Josephine, and she focused her <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local workhouse. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases—particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy—through the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Josephine also formed the International Abolitionist Federation, a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.|$|E
5|$|The poem's {{focus on}} France {{served as a}} way for Southey to discuss his {{feelings}} about the French Revolution. In particular, Southey was upset that the British were calling men from their farms to serve as a militia during the time. In terms of the French, Southey did not support Robespierre and the others who followed him in France. However, he did support the idea of the French Republic. When he heard of Marie Antoinette's execution in October 1793, Southey told his friend Bedford that he condemned the action although he held to his Republican beliefs. However, he was further upset when word came that Brissot, the Girondin leader, was executed. This caused him to believe that all of the countries were equally bad, except the Republican United States, which he hoped to make his home. In 1794, many of Southey's <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> Robespierre's involvement in these actions were included in both Joan of Arc and the Fall of Robbespierre, which followed after Robespierre's own execution. However, Southey had by then become very radical and believed that Robespierre was a great man who only helped mankind in his actions.|$|E

5|$|In late 1933-early 1934, a major strain {{was placed}} on German-Japanese {{relations}} when the German ambassador to Japan, when Ambassador Herbert von Dirksen appointed Ferdinand Heye, a Nazi Party member and a disreputable German businessman convicted by a Chinese court of opium smuggling in 1927 the Special German Trade Commissioner for Manchukuo. The Japanese attached much importance {{to the question of}} recognizing Manchukuo, which was seen as a litmus test for whatever one was a true friend of Japan or of China. Heye attempted with the support of Dirksen to have the Japanese give him a monopoly of exporting soybeans from Manchukuo, in exchange for which he promised to have Germany recognize Manchukuo. The ambitious Heye, having won the friendship of the Kwantung Army by promising that he would have the Reich recognize Manchukuo, then attempted to use his position as German Trade Commissioner to Manchukuo to secure a monopoly on all German investments in Manchukuo. The attempts of Heye and Dirksen to have Germany recognize Manchukuo involved them in a dispute with Neurath who preferred to keep Germany's special relationship it had established with the Kuomintang regime in China going, and who knew well that the Chinese would be extremely offended if Germany recognized Manchukuo. The Heye affair caused much bad <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> both sides, and was ended in February 1935 with the victory of Neurath when Hitler disallowed Heye and his promises he made.|$|E
25|$|The {{play as a}} whole {{deals with}} many Shakespearean themes and emphasises the {{precedents}} of both Brutus and Mark Antony throughout. Southey's third act captures his <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> the French Revolution and incorporates his radical views. The act also contains his <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> despotism and liberty.|$|E
25|$|Hopkins {{would later}} explain his comments, {{saying that it}} was not meant to be taken as a racial slur or a {{reflection}} of his <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> white fighters, but simply said to create some hype for his fight with Calzaghe.|$|E

25|$|The Destiny of Nations was {{composed}} by Samuel Taylor Coleridge {{as part of}} Robert Southey's Joan of Arc epic poem. The lines were later isolated from Southey's and expanded. The new poem includes Coleridge's <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> politics, religion, and humanity's duty to helping each other.|$|E
25|$|Wardle was {{big enough}} to admit his {{troubles}} were largely of his own making, and any ill <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> his part was forgotten when he helped Yorkshire and England off-spinner Geoff Cope to iron out the problems in his action, which had occasionally had him 'called' for throwing.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a change}} in subject matter for Flores' murals {{at the turn of}} the 1970s, {{shifting}} from historical and universal themes to works containing his own ideas and <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> social and political events.

25|$|Haley {{conducted}} {{the first interview}} for Playboy magazine. His interview with jazz musician Miles Davis appeared in the September 1962 issue. Haley elicited candid comments from Davis about his thoughts and <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> racism. That interview {{set the tone for}} what became a significant feature of the magazine. Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Playboy Interview with Haley was the longest he ever granted to any publication.|$|E
25|$|Experienced debate judges (who were {{generally}} debaters {{in high school}} and/or college) generally carry a mindset that favors certain arguments and styles over others. Depending on what mindset, or paradigm, the judge uses, the debate can be drastically different. Because {{there is no one}} view of debate agreed upon by everyone, many debaters question a judge about their paradigm and/or their <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> specific arguments before the round.|$|E

25|$|Jim Crawford was a Realist {{writer and}} a part of the National Council of Groups. He was {{associated}} with many other playwrights in Australia at the time, who were both Communists and playwrights. Crawford's political interests were his biggest influences and his career as a journalist gave him access to the latest political news stories and contemporary <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> issues such as Aboriginal rights, women's rights and the rethinking of Capitalist ideas.|$|E
25|$|The Royalist {{victory was}} capped when they hauled off {{considerable}} military stores {{abandoned by the}} fleeing communists, including half a dozen armored cars and eight artillery pieces. However, the route to the Plain of Jars was still blocked by communist forces. As a result, there were hard <b>feelings</b> <b>on</b> part of the RLA regulars, who felt cheated of their triumph. Nor was that the only factor dampening Royalist morale; the Tonkin Gulf Incident of 2 August that officially began the Vietnam War immediately overshadowed Operation Triangle.|$|E
