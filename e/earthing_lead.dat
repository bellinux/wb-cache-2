40|$|Sweden has {{experienced}} many geomagnetically induced current (GIC) {{events in the}} past, which is obviously due to the high-latitude location of the country. The largest GIC, almost 300 A, was measured in southern Sweden in the <b>earthing</b> <b>lead</b> of a 400 kV transformer neutral during the magnetic storm on 6 April 2000. On 30 October 2003, the city of Malmo at the southern coast suffered from a power blackout caused by GIC, leaving 50, 000 customers without electricity for about 20 - 50 min. We have developed a model that enables calculation of GIC in the southern Swedish 400 kV power grid. This work constitutes the first modeling effort of GIC in Sweden. The model {{is divided into two}} parts. The electric field is first derived using a ground conductivity model and geomagnetic recordings from nearby stations. The conductivity model is determined from a least squares fit between measured and calculated GIC. GIC are calculated using a power grid model consisting of the topology of the system and of the transformer, transmission line, and station earthing resistances {{as well as of the}} coordinates of the stations. To validate the model, we have compared measured and calculated GIC from one site. In total, 24 events in 1998 to 2000 were used. In general the agreement is satisfactory as the correct GIC order of magnitude is obtained by the model, which is usually enough for engineering applications...|$|E

50|$|From the {{perspective}} of a planetary geologist, the atmosphere is an evolutionary agent essential to the shaping of a planet. The wind picks up dust and other particles which, when they collide with the terrain, erode the relief and leave deposits (eolian processes). Frost and precipitations, which depend on the atmospheric composition, also influence the relief. Climate changes can influence a planet's geological history. Conversely, studying surface of <b>Earth</b> <b>leads</b> {{to an understanding of the}} atmosphere and climate of a planet—both its present state and its past.|$|R

Within this context, the possible catalytic role of pyrrhotite, one of the most abundant sulfide minerals, in biomimetic redox and carbon fixation reactions was studied. Our results showed that pyrrhotite, under simulated hydrothermal conditions, could catalyze the pyruvate synthesis from lactate and that a dynamic system formed by coupling iron metal and iron-sulfur species in an electrochemical cell could promote carbon fixation from thioacetate esters...|$|R
