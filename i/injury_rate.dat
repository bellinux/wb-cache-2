5|$|Although the {{accident}} rate per 100 million miles for professional truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving a risky occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. The fatal <b>injury</b> <b>rate</b> in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not break out the fatal <b>injury</b> <b>rate</b> per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers among aircraft pilots and flight engineers but did note that they had a high fatal <b>injury</b> <b>rate</b> compared to all workers.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} examining the effects of mining height on <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> in United States underground nonlongwall bituminous coal mines after controlling for number of employees and mining methods. Data were obtained from employment and accident/injury databases of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Nonfatal disabling <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> were determined for the 5 year period from 1990 to 1994. Details regarding the populations of the mines {{included in the analysis}} and the demographics of injured miners were described. A total of 22, 607 underground nonfatal injuries which had corresponding seam height information were reported to the MSHA over the study period; 91. 6 % of these were due to handling materials, machinery, powered haulage, slip or fall of person, fall of mine roof, and/or nonpowered hand tools. The strongest relationship between seam height and <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> was seen for walking/running and crawling/kneeling activities. Accidents involving load, haul, and dump types of powered haulage equipment demonstrated the most consistent trend in <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> associated with differences in seam height. <b>Injury</b> <b>rates</b> declined as seam height increased for all mine types for these types of accidents. The lowest <b>rates</b> of <b>injuries</b> involving shuttle cars and the highest <b>rates</b> of <b>injuries</b> involving powered haulage conveyors were observed in low seams across all mine sizes. Fatal and non fatal <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> for machinery accidents involving roof bolters and nonfatal injuries resulting from falls of roof were lowest in high seam mines, {{with the exception of the}} largest mines. Nonfatal disabling <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> for material handling accidents and <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> for accidents involving powered haulage locomotives were greater in larger mines. Fatal and nonfatal <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> for accidents involving continuous mining machines were inversely proportional to mine size. The authors conclude that the effects of mining height on <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> warrant further investigation. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 by Barbara Fotta and Launa G. Mallet. "November 1997.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Injuries due {{to sports}} and {{activity}} amongst young children constitute a significant public health burden. It {{is important to}} quantify this risk {{to ensure that the}} benefits of sport participation are not outweighed by the potential harms. AIM: to summarise the literature reporting exposure based <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> for various forms of physical activity amongst children younger aged 15 years and younger METHODS: a systematic review was conducted including all studies that reported <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> per exposure measure for children younger than 16 years of age. RESULTS: We located 34 studies that met the inclusion criteria of which 19 reported <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> per an hourly based exposure measured and 15 reported <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> according to some other measure. The included studies covered 13 different sports and activities, mostly team ball sports with soccer being the most widely studied activity. The injury definition and method of ascertaining and measuring injuries differed between studies which created a large variation in reported <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> that did not necessarily represent actual injury risk differences between activities. The highest hourly based <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> were reported for ice hockey and the lowest were for soccer, although the range of <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> for both of these activities were wide. CONCLUSION: There exists a significant body of literature reporting <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> for childhood sports, however there are large inconsistencies in injury definition and study methods. Very few studies have studied sports related injuries in children younger that 8 years or in non-organised sports paradigms. Griffith Health, School of MedicineNo Full Tex...|$|R

In 2006, the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranked commercial fishing as the job occupation with the highest fatality rate with 141.7 per 100,000, almost 75% higher than the fatality rate for pilots, flight engineers and loggers, the next most hazardous occupations. However, Alaskan king crab fishing is considered even more dangerous than the average commercial fishing job, due to the conditions on the Bering Sea during the seasons they fish for crab. According to the pilot episode, the death rate during the main crab seasons averages out to nearly one fisherman per week, while the <b>injury</b> <b>rate</b> for crews on most crab boats is nearly 100% due to the severe weather conditions (frigid gales, rogue waves, ice formations on and around the boat) and the danger of working with such heavy machinery on a constantly rolling boat deck.

40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine to what extent {{management}} practices in safety culture are effective in reducing workplace injuries. Design/methodology/approach – Management practices are an important component of an organization’s safety climate. The study was conducted in a major industrial zone in Malaysia. The management practices examined in this study were reward, training, management commitment, communication and feedback, hiring practices, and employee participation. In total, 68 companies participated in this study; the injury data provided by the companies were for three years and 24 musculoskeletal injuries were examined. Findings– The multiple correlation was at 0. 43 and the R 2 was 0. 19. A significant linear relationship between management practices subscale and <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> was obtained (F¼ 2 : 28,p¼ 0 : 14). Rewards, management commitment, feedback and selection were found to reduce <b>injury</b> <b>rates.</b> However, only feedback (t¼ 22 : 98) and employee participation (t¼ 2 : 01) were significantly predicting the <b>injury</b> <b>rates.</b> Implementing good management practices does reduce <b>injury</b> <b>rates.</b> Research limitations/implications– Nevertheless, a positive relationship for participation with <b>injury</b> <b>rates</b> suggests that a re-examination of these practices is necessary, as it may not be effective in reducing <b>injury</b> <b>rates.</b> Practical implications – It may be posited that although frequency counts of injuries in the workplace do provide some indication of the extent of workplace injury; nevertheless they do not provide a true account of the severity of these injuries.

Methods were developed to estimate standard errors using data from different sample frames and sample sizes. RESULTS. Working Blacks had fewer reported injuries requiring medical attention or restriction of usual activities than working Whites (22. 0 vs 27. 0 per 100 persons per year). The difference was pronounced among younger adults in both sexes and among both poor and nonpoor. However, age, sex, and income could not completely explain racial differentials.
