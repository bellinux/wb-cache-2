6000|$|I {{return the}} proofs of Eleanor, in a {{separate}} cover from this, and as I think it wise to register them I must wait till to-morrow a.m. to do that, and this, therefore, will reach you first. Let me immediately say that I don't light (and I've read carefully every word, and many two or three times, as Mr. Bellasis would say--and is Mr. B., by the way, naturally--as it were--H. J.???!!! on any peccant particular spots in the aspect of Lucy F. that the American reader would challenge. I do think he, or she, may be likely, at first, to think her more English than American--to say, I mean: [...] "Why, this isn't us--it's English 'Dissent.'" [...] For it's well--generally--to keep in mind how very different a thing that is (socially, aesthetically &c.) from the American free (and easy) multitudinous churches, that, practically, in any community, are like so many (almost) clubs or Philharmonics or amateur theatrical companies. I don't quite think the however obscure American girl <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>you</b> to conceive would have any shockability about Rome, the Pope, St. Peter's, kneeling, or anything of that sort--least of all any girl whose concatenations could, by any possibility of social handing-on, land her in the milieu you present at Albano. She would probably be either a Unitarian or [...] "Orthodox" [...] (which is, I believe, [...] "Congregational," [...] though in New England always called [...] "Orthodox") and in either case as Emersonized, Hawthornized, J. A. Symondsized, and as [...] "frantic" [...] to feel the Papacy &c, as one could well represent her. And this, I mean, even were she of any provincial New England circle whatever that one could conceive as ramifying, however indirectly, into Villa Barb. This particularly were her father a college professor. In that case I should say [...] "The bad clothes &c, oh yes; {{as much as you}} like. The beauty &c, scarcely. The offishness to Rome--as a spectator &c.--almost not at all." [...] All this, roughly and hastily speaking. But there is no false note of surface, beyond this, I think, that you need be uneasy about at all. Had I looked over your shoulder I should have said: [...] "Specify, localise, a little more--give her a definite Massachusetts, or Maine, or whatever, habitation--imagine a country-college-town--invent, if need be, a name, and stick to that." [...] This for smallish, but appreciable reasons that I haven't space to develop--but after all not imperative. For the rest the chapters you send me are, as a beginning, to my vision very charming and interesting and pleasing--full of promise of strong elements--as your beginnings always are.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, I {{have been}} even to my own sense too long and too hideously silent--small wonder that I should have learned from dear Mary Cadwal {{therefore}} (here since Saturday night) that I have seemed to you not less miserably so. Yet there has been all the while a certain sublime inevitability in it--over and above those general reactions in favour of a simplifying and softening mutisme that increase with my increasing age and infirmity. I am {{able to go on}} only always plus doucement, and when you are off on different phases of your great world-swing the mere side-wind of it from afar, across continents and seas, stirs me to wonderments and admirations, sympathies, curiosities, intensities of envy, and eke thereby of humility, which I have to check and guard against for their strain on my damaged organism. The relation thus escapes me--and I feel it must so escape you, drunk with draughts of every description and immersed in visions which so utterly and inevitably turn their back--or turn yours--on what one might one's self have de mieux to vous offrir. The idea of tugging at you to make you look round therefore--look round at these small sordidries and poornesses, and thereby lose the very finest flash of the revelation then and there organised for you or (the great thing!) by you perchance: that affects me ever as really consonant with no minimum even of modesty or discretion on one's own account--so that, in fine, I have simply lain stretched, a faithful old veteran slave, upon the door-mat of your palace of adventure, sufficiently proud to give the alarm of any irruption, should I catch it, but otherwise waiting till you should emerge again, stepping over my prostrate form to do so. That gracious act now performed by you--since <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>you</b> to be back in Paris by this speaking--I get up, as you see, to wish you the most affectionate and devoted welcome home and tell you that I believe myself to have [...] "kept" [...] in quite a sound and decent way, in the domestic ice-chest of your absence. I mix my metaphors a little, comme toujours (or rather comme jamais!) but the great thing is to feel you really within hail again and in this air of my own poor little world, which isn't for me the non-conductor (that's the real hitch when you're [...] "off") of that of your great globe-life. I won't try to ask you of this last glory now--for, though the temperature of the ice-chest itself has naturally risen with your nearer approximation, I still shall keep long enough, I trust, to sit at your knee in some peaceful nook here and gather in the wondrous tale. I have had echoes--even, in very faint and vague form, that of the burglarious attempt upon you in the anonymous oriental city (vagueness does possess me!)--but by the time my sound of indignant participation would have reached you I took up my Lit. Supp. to find you in such force over the subject you there treated, on that so happy occasion, that the beautiful firmness and [...] "clarity," [...] even if not charity, of your nerves and tone clearly gave the lie to any fear I should entertain for the effect of your annoyance. I greatly admired by the same token the fine strain of that critical voice from out the path of shade projected upon the desert sand, as I suppose, by the silhouette of your camel. Beautifully said, thought, felt, inimitably jeté, the paper has excited great attention and admiration here--and is probably doing an amount of missionary work in savage breasts that we shall yet have some comparatively rude or ingenuous betrayal of. I do notice that the flow of the little impayables reviews meanders on--but enfin ne désespérons pas.... But oh dear, I want to see you about everything--and am yours all affectionately and not in the least patiently, ...|$|E

However, I do not emphasize {{the fact that you are}} now a “veteran” [...] 2 ̆ 6 I think it is best that you “skim over” exactly what you’re doing when you write to them. I believe Sanford shares this opinion! So glad you have rec’d most all of my letters—it gives me an incentive to keep the pen moving! Also, the films from the Kodak Company have arrived 2 ̆ 6 I’ll send them to you with some toiletries 2 ̆ 6 stuff! I’ll probably mail a package to you next week, 2 ̆ 6 hope that, in the meanwhile, you will receive some of your Xmas presents, plus the camera I sent, plus the cigarette lighter Morty sent you. Thanks sweetheart for the clippings! The map is certainly a good one! Altho’ <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>you</b> are seeing action 2 ̆ 6 I should be worried 2 ̆ 6 upset—well, I’m not!

Boy, they sure feed you good—considering your location! I hope your various comforts (shelter 2 ̆ 6 food) continue to be good! Can you imagine—after all these months I finally get a letter from Esther Moskowitz? She’s doing social work at a mental hosp. in N.

My dramatic group was very enthusiastic tonight 2 ̆ 6 if it continues that way, we may be able to put on a good show some time in the spring. Thurs.

Tonight, Mrs. Chand (Douglas’ mom) brought her mother up with her to call for Doug.
