25|$|In 1519, Holbein {{moved back}} to Basel. His brother fades from the record at about this time, and it is usually presumed that he died. Holbein re-established himself rapidly in the city, running a busy workshop. He joined the painters' guild and took out Basel citizenship. He married Elsbeth Schmid, a widow a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> he was, who had an infant son, Franz, and was running her late husband's tanning business. She bore Holbein a son of his own, Philipp, {{in their first year}} of marriage.|$|E
25|$|Holmes {{arrived in}} Chicago in August 1886 and came across Elizabeth S. Holton's {{drugstore}} at {{the southwest corner}} of South Wallace Avenue and West 63rd Street in Englewood. Holton gave Holmes a job, and he proved himself to be a hardworking employee, eventually buying the store. Although several books portray Holton's husband as an old man who quickly vanished along with his wife, Dr. Holton was actually a fellow Michigan alumnus, only a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> Holmes, and both Holtons remained in Englewood throughout Holmes' life and survived well into the 20th century; the idea that Holmes killed them is strictly fiction.|$|E

He is a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> George {{but has been}} friends with him since his school days even though Dobbin's father is a fig-merchant and the Osbornes belong to the genteel class and have become independently wealthy. He defends George and is blind to his faults in many ways although he tries to force George {{to do the right}} thing. He pushes George to keep his promise to marry Amelia even though Dobbin is in love with Amelia himself. After George is killed, Dobbin puts together an annuity to help support Amelia, ostensibly with the help of George's fellow officers.|$|E

50|$|The {{age of the}} Daohugou bed {{has been}} debated, {{and a number of}} studies, using {{different}} methodologies, have reached conflicting conclusions. Various papers have placed the fossils here as being anywhere from the Middle Jurassic period (169 million years ago) to the Early Cretaceous period (122 ma). One of the first studies on the age of the Daohugou beds, published in 2004 by He et al., found them to be Early Cretaceous, only a <b>few</b> million <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> the overlying Jehol beds of the Yixian Formation. The 2004 study primarily used Argon-argon dating of a tuff within the Daohugou Beds to determine its age.|$|R

The remnants of this astrobleme {{have been a}} major subject of debate among geologists since their discovery in the early 19th century. The explanation was only given in 1969 by the French geologist François Kraut, who definitely proved the impact origin of the breccias. The Rochechouart impact crater was the first crater whose nature was proved by the impact effects on the rocks, without any circular topographic features being visible. New research from 2017 shows that this crater is a <b>few</b> million <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> the Triassic-Jurassic boundary.|$|R
25|$|Prior to World War I, Caruso {{had been}} romantically {{linked to an}} Italian soprano, Ada Giachetti, who was a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> he was. Though already married, Giachetti bore Caruso four sons during their liaison, which lasted from 1897 to 1908. Two survived infancy: Rodolfo Caruso (1898-1951) and singer/actor Enrico Caruso, Jr. (1904-1987). Ada had left her husband, {{manufacturer}} Gino Botti, and an existing son to cohabit with the tenor. Information provided in Scott's biography of Caruso suggests that she was his vocal coach {{as well as his}} lover. Statements by Enrico Caruso, Jr. in his book tend to substantiate this. Her relationship with Caruso broke down after 11 years and they separated. Giachetti's subsequent attempts to sue him for damages were dismissed by the courts.|$|E

500|$|Art Modell, a New York {{advertising}} executive, {{bought the}} team in 1961 for almost $4 million ($ today). Modell, who was 35 {{years old at the}} time, bought out Brown's 15% stake in the team for $500,000 and gave Brown a new eight-year contract. He said he and Brown would have a [...] "working partnership", and began to play a more direct role than previous owners in the team's operation. [...] This angered Brown, who was used to having a free hand in football matters. Modell, who was single and only a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> most players, started to listen to their concerns about the coach. He became particularly close to Jim Brown, calling him [...] "my senior partner". Modell sat in the press box during games and could be overheard second-guessing Paul Brown's play-calling, which drove a deeper wedge between the two men. At that time, Brown was the only coach who insisted on calling every offensive play. When Plum openly questioned Paul Brown's absolute control over play-calling, he was traded to Detroit.|$|E

These are very refractory materials and were interpreted as being condensates from a hot solar nebula. then {{discovered that the}} oxygen in these objects was enhanced in 16O by ~5% while the 17O/18O {{was the same as}} terrestrial. This clearly showed a large effect in an abundant element that might be nuclear, possibly from a stellar source. These objects were then found to contain strontium with very low 87Sr/86Sr indicating that they were a <b>few</b> million <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> previously analyzed meteoritic material and that this type of material would merit a search for 26Al. [...] 26Al is only present today in solar system materials as the result of cosmic reactions on unshielded materials at an extremely low level. Thus, any original 26Al in the early Solar system is now extinct.|$|R
50|$|The Areni-1 shoe is a 5,500-year-old leather shoe {{that was}} found in 2008 in {{excellent}} condition in the Areni-1 cave complex located in the Vayots Dzor province of Armenia. It is a one-piece leather-hide shoe that has been dated as a <b>few</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> the one found on Ötzi the Iceman, making it the oldest piece of leather footwear in the world known to contemporary researchers. Much older footwear, 10,000-year-old sandals made of sagebrush fiber, has been discovered in the United States at Fort Rock Cave in Oregon. By evidence found to date, the use of shoes arose between 40,000 and 26,000 years ago. The discovery was made by an international team led by Boris Gasparyan, an archaeologist from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia (co-directors of the project are Ron Pinhasi from University College Cork in Ireland, and Gregory Areshian from UCLA).|$|R

[...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters compared [...] "Don't Let Me Stop You" [...] (2009) with [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] saying that the former [...] "may sound like another rewrite of an older Clarkson hit (in this case, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes"), but the observational lyrics about a questionable relationship are what ultimately makes the whole thing click." [...] Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine felt that the song should sell records more because [...] "the entire musical backing drops out to let Clarkson’s voice through to live or die on its own." [...] Pam Avoledo of Blogcritics believed that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was superior to the writing of [...] "Since U Been Gone", commenting that [...] "It's punchier, well-written and gives Clarkson a chance to show off her vocal skills without the trendy haughtiness."

500|$|According to {{producer}} Don Hahn, Beaumont's Belle is an [...] "incredibly passive" [...] character, {{the personality}} of whom he likened to those of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, as well as American actress and animal rights activist Doris Day, describing them as women who are [...] "capable, but filling a role that women might fill in the 1950s and 1960s.” The filmmakers painstakingly reworked Belle into a more three-dimensional character by providing her with goals and aspirations beyond romance and marriage, while expanding her passive role into that of a more inquisitive heroine. Determined to have Belle resemble [...] "an unusual Disney heroine," [...] Woolverton deliberately molded her into an independent character {{who is not a}} princess, enjoys books and has little interest in marriage, and worked closely with Ashman to create a proactive heroine [...] "who was a thinker and a reader and she wasn’t about what she looked like and she wasn’t a victim." [...] Although Belle being well-read is mentioned in the original fairy tale, it is hardly important to its plot. Thus, Belle's passion for reading was vastly expanded upon, borrowing from both the Little Woman character Jo March and Woolverton's own love of reading to further demonstrate the character's intelligence and open mind. Both Woolverton and O'Hara encouraged the filmmakers to emphasize the intelligent and book-loving aspects of Belle's personality. However, at times the animators struggled to fulfill Woolverton's vision. Originally, Belle was depicted constantly crying throughout her imprisonment; Woolverton resented this, arguing that the character was {{much more likely to be}} either searching for an escape or simply [...] "be intrigued that she was living in an enchanted castle" [...] than crying. [...] "Once everybody realized she wasn’t going to be this typical Disney female, they would go to the extreme ... She became bitchy"; the screenwriter argued that Belle would be [...] "too smart" [...] to act this way. A <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> The Little Mermaids Ariel, Belles' love of reading makes the character more worldly and mature than her predecessor. Belle is believed by Henn to be [...] "probably" [...] the oldest of Disney's princesses, at 20 years of age.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION : We here {{present the}} surface models of two {{specimens}} of sloths(Mammalia, Tardigrada) {{coming from the}} Late Pliocene WareFormation (Cocinetas Basin, La Guajira, Colombia, see Table 1). Along with three additional sloth taxa found in the same Formation, these specimens document the great diversity of this Neotropical locality. Furthermore, they represent a sloth assemblage from a locality just a <b>few</b> hundred thousand <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> the classically recognized first main pulse of the Great American Biotic interchange, that is located few hundred kilometers away from the Isthmus of Panama, the most likely route of migration of terrestrial taxa.

40|$|We {{describe}} sloth assemblages {{from the}} Cocinetas Basin (La Guajira peninsula, Colombia), {{found in the}} Neogene Castilletes and Ware formations, located in northernmost South America, documenting otherwise poorly known biotas. The tentative referral of a specimen to a small megatherioid sloth, Hyperleptus?, from the early–middle Miocene Castilletes Formation, suggests affinities of this fauna with the distant Santa Cruz Formation and documents a large latitudinal distribution for this taxon. The late Pliocene Ware Formation is much more diverse, with five distinct taxa representing every family of ‘ground sloths’. This diversity is also remarkable at the ecological level, with sloths spanning over two orders of magnitude of body mass and probably having different feeding strategies. Being {{only a few hundred}} kilometres away from the Isthmus of Panama, and a <b>few</b> hundred thousand <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> the classically recognized first main pulse of the Great American Biotic interchange (GABI 1), the Ware Formation furthermore documents an important fauna for the understanding of this major event in Neogene palaeobiogeography.

2500|$|The {{inclusion}} of the pagan figure of Caelus may seem strange, {{but he was not}} an important figure in Ancient Roman religion, so was evidently considered as a harmless pictorial convention by the Christian designer of the composition, as well as one of the elements showing continuity with Roman tradition.
