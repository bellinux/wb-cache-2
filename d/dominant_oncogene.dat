In the absence of a <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogene</b> encoded by the HBV genome, indirect roles have been proposed, including insertional activation of cellular oncogenes by HBV DNA integration, induction of genetic instability by viral integration or by the regulatory protein HBx, and long term effects of viral proteins in enhancing immune-mediated liver disease. In this chapter, we discuss different models of HBV-mediated liver cell transformation based on animal systems of hepadnavirus infection as well as functional studies in hepatocyte and hepatoma cell lines. These studies might help identifying the cellular effectors connecting HBV infection and liver cell transformation...|$|E
30|$|The {{earliest}} known {{alterations in}} MLL family genes involved frequent rearrangements of MLL 1 at 11 q 23, with recombination involving more than 40 different partner genes and occurring in 60 %– 80 % of infants with ALL or AML (Dimartino and Cleary, 1999; Pais et al., 2005; Thirman et al., 1993). Since then, several missense and truncating mutations {{have been identified}} in MLL 1 in bladder, lung, and breast cancer (Gui et al., 2011; Kan et al., 2010). Although MLL 1 acts as a <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogene</b> in liquid tumors, these new discoveries suggest a different recessive role for MLL 1 in some solid tumors (Krivtsov and Armstrong, 2007). Infrequent truncating mutations have also been noted in MLL 4 in medulloblastoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), suggesting a minor but alternative role for this family member as well (Pugh et al., 2012; Stransky et al., 2011).|$|E

40|$|Homozygous deletions {{have been}} central to the {{discovery}} of several tumor-suppressor genes, but their finding has often been either serendipitous or the result of a directed search. A recently described technique [Lisitsyn, N., Lisitsyn, N. & Wigler, M. (1993) Science 259, 946 - 951] held out the potential to efficiently discover such events in an unbiased manner. Here we present the application of the representational difference analysis (RDA) to the study of cancer. We cloned two DNA fragments that identified a homozygous deletion in a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, mapping to a 1 -centimorgan region at chromosome 13 q 12. 3 flanked by the markers D 13 S 171 and D 13 S 260. Interestingly, this lies within the 6 -centimorgan region recently identified as the BRCA 2 locus of heritable breast cancer susceptibility. This suggests that the same gene may be involved in multiple tumor types and that its function is that of a tumor suppressor rather than that of a <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogene...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{multicellular}} organisms, {{cell proliferation}} and death must be regulated to maintain tissue homeostasis. Many observations {{suggest that this}} regulation may be achieved, in part, by coupling the process of cell cycle progression and programmed cell death by using and controlling a shared set of factors. An {{argument in favor of}} a link between the cell cycle and apoptosis arises from the accumulated evidence that manipulation of the cell cycle may either prevent or induce an apoptotic response. This linkage has been recognized for tumor suppressor genes such as p 53 and RB, the <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogene,</b> c-Myc, several cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and their regulators. These proteins that function in proliferative pathways may also act to sensitize cells to apoptosis. Indeed, unregulated cell proliferation can result in pathologic conditions including neoplasias if it is not countered by the appropriate cell death. Translating the knowledge gained by studying the connection between cell death and cell proliferation may aid in identifying novel therapies to circumvent disease progression or improve clinical outcome...|$|E

40|$|Aberrant {{cellular}} signaling networks lie at {{the heart}} of cancer pathogenesis. Whether stimulated by a <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogene</b> or activated receptor tyrosine kinase, these signals affect biological processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. In the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (EFST), a group of pediatric bone and soft tissue malignancies, EWS/FLI 1 transcriptional modulation and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) signaling are the two main forces that drive tumorigenesis. In order to obtain a comprehensive view of signaling, we applied a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic approach to quantify global changes in phosphorylation after IGF 1 stimulation, IGF 1 receptor inhibition, and EWS/FLI 1 knock down. Our analyses identified hundreds unique phosphopeptides enriched in processes such as regulation of cell cycle and cytoskeleton organization. In particular, examination of tyrosine phosphopeptides downstream of IGF 1 identified potential roles for Src family kinases and members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases in ESFT pathogenesis. Additionally, phosphotyrosine profiling revealed a large up regulation of Stat 3 phosphorylation upon EWS/FLI 1 knock down. Further investigation revealed this activation occurs through a paracrine mechanism. Overall, phosphoproteomic profiling has uncovered novel regulators and mechanisms for ESFT signaling, allowing for the development of new therapeutic strategies...|$|E
40|$|Fish of {{the genus}} Xiphophorus are {{polymorphic}} for black pigmentation patterns. Certain intra- or interspecific hybrids exhibit enhanced expression of these patterns, leading in many cases to malignant melanoma. Because no recombination was ever observed between the pattern information and the genetic predisposition to develop melanoma after hybridization, a "tumor gene" (Tu) was postulated that encodes both phenotypes. A <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogene,</b> ONC-Xmrk, was then found to be necessary and sufficient for the transforming function of Tu. Here we present molecular evidence that ONC-Xmrk and the pigment pattern information are encoded by separate, although intimately linked loci. No ONC-Xmrk gene was present in the 15 Xiphophorus strains investigated which exhibit no black pigmentation pattern. Five different patterns from Xiphophorus maculatus, X. evelynae, X. milleri, X. cortezi, and X. montezumae were associated with ONC-Xmrk and were melanomagenic, while fish of X. helleri, X. variatus, X. nezahualcoyotl, and X. montezumae with five other patterns had no ONC-Xmrk and consequently did not produce hybrid melanoma. These data provide evidence that ONC-Xmrk is sufficient for tumorigenesis in Xiphophorus hybrids, and that a separate, pigment pattern-encoding locus is closely linked to it...|$|E

In the current study, we demonstrate that MYC‐depleted melanoma cells undergo extensive DNA damage that is caused by the underexpression of thymidylate synthase (TS) and ribonucleotide reductase (RR) and subsequent depletion of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools. Simultaneous genetic inhibition of TS and RR in melanoma cells induced DNA damage and senescence phenotypes very similar to the ones caused by MYC‐depletion. Reciprocally, overexpression of TS and RR in melanoma cells or addition of deoxyribonucleosides to culture media substantially inhibited DNA damage and senescence‐associated phenotypes caused by C‐MYC depletion.

To develop this strategy into a practical means to approach malignant disease, methods must be devel oped to accomplish high efficiency delivery of the ribozyme to target neoplastic cells. To accomplish this, a recombinant adenovirus was de signed that encoded a gene cassette for the H-ras ribozyme. By using this virus, it was possible to accomplish high efficiency reversion of the neo plastic phenotype in mutant H-ras expressing tumor cells without the need for any selection steps.

TRF 2 overexpression has been suggested to induce tumor development in the mouse, and TRF 2 levels have been found increased in human tumors. Here we tested whether moderate expression of TRF 2 in the hematopoietic system leads to cancer development in the mouse. TRF 2 and a GFP-TRF 2 fusion protein were introduced into hematopoietic precursors, and tested for function. TRF 2 overexpressing cells were integrated into the hematopoietic system of C 57 BL/ 6 J recipient mice, and animals were put on tumor watch. An increase in the development of T-cell lymphomas was observed in secondary recipient animals, however, overexpression of the TRF 2 transgene was not detectable anymore in the tumors. The tumors were characterized as large cell blastic T-cell lymphomas and displayed signs of genome instability as evidenced by chromosome fusions.

Restriction-fragment-length polymorphism analysis showed loss of D 1 S 1 heterozygosity in 16 of the 21 cases (76 %). D 3 S 2 heterozygosity was lost in 2 of 11 cases (18 %).

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{our studies}} was to {{determine}} whether the phenotype of the anaplastic thyroid carcinomas is dominant or recessive. In fact, it is hypothesized, on the basis of epidemiological and pathological data, that undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas are derived from differentiated tumours through a mechanism of tumour progression. Design: Cell hybrids have been generated by cell fusion of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines, which show a highly malignant phenotype, to cell lines deriving from differentiated thyroid carcinoma, which show a non-tumorigenic or a poorly tumorigenic phenotype. All of the parental cell lines showed impaired p 53 gene function. Results: The cell hybrids contained alleles from the parental cell lines. All of the cell hybrids showed a lower growth rate compared with the parental undifferentiated carcinoma cell lines and were unable to grow in soft agar and to induce tumours after injection into athymic mice. Conclusion: Taken together, these ®ndings suggest that the highly malignant phenotype of the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is achieved by the impairment of gene functions that negatively regulate cell growth, rather than by the activation of <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogenes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Many assays for oncogenic {{transformation}} {{have been}} developed ranging from those in established rodent cell lines where morphological alteration is scored, to those in human cells growing in nude mice where tumor invasiveness is scored. In general, systems that are most quantitative are also the least relevant {{in terms of human}} carcinogenesis and human risk estimation. The development of cell culture systems has made it possible to assess at the cellular level the oncogenic potential of a variety of chemical, physical and viral agents. Cell culture systems afford the opportunity to identify factors and conditions that may prevent or enhance cellular transformation by radiation and chemicals. Permissive and protective factors in radiation-induced transformation include thyroid hormone and the tumor promoter TPA that increase the transformation incidence for a given dose of radiation, and retinoids, selenium, vitamin E, and 5 -aminobenzamide that inhibit the expression of transformation. Densely ionizing alpha-particles, similar to those emitted by radon daughters, are highly effective in inducing transformations and appear to interact in a supra-additive fashion with asbestos fibers. The activation of a known <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogene</b> has not yet been demonstrated in radiation-induced oncogenic transformation.

RESULTS [...] Overexpression of ILGFR 1, EGFR, c-erbB- 2, c-ras and c-myc was found in, respectively, nine of 80 (11 %), 10 of 80 (12 %), 19 of 80 (24 %), 16 of 80 (20 %) and 28 of 80 (35 %) ovarian carcinomas. The levels of expression of ILGFR 1, EGFR, c-erbB- 2 and c-ras were significantly higher in the tumours of patients with recurrent or persistent disease after chemotherapy than in the tumours of patients at initial presentation (p < 0. 02).

40|$|Many cancers and leukemias are {{associated}} with strong dominant oncogenic mutations that activate tyrosine kinases and other classes of molecules, including transcription factors and antiapoptotic mechanisms. Some of these events can be targeted with small molecules or antibody-based therapeutics, but many remain intractable.

Therapies directed at the mRNA encoding <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogenes</b> could provide a more global set of technologies for cancer treatment. To test this concept, we have used the model of transformation of hematopoietic cells by the chimeric Bcr-Abl oncogene, a highly activated tyrosine kinase.

Here, we show that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in Evi- 1 -deficient embryos are severely reduced in number with defective proliferative and repopulating capacity. Selective ablation of Evi- 1 in Tie 2 + cells mimics Evi- 1 deficiency, suggesting that Evi- 1 function is required in Tie 2 + hematopoietic stem/progenitors. Conditional deletion of Evi- 1 in the adult hematopoietic system revealed that Evi- 1 -deficient bone marrow HSCs cannot maintain hematopoiesis and lose their repopulating ability. In contrast, Evi- 1 is dispensable for blood cell lineage commitment. Evi- 1 +/ mice exhibit the intermediate phenotype for HSC activity, suggesting a gene dosage requirement for Evi- 1. We further demonstrate that disruption of Evi- 1 in transformed leukemic cells leads to significant loss of their proliferative activity both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, Evi- 1 is a common and critical regulator essential for proliferation of embryonic/adult HSCs and transformed leukemic cells...|$|R

Many molecular techniques are used to identify these abnormalities, including single strand conformational polymorphism, the polymerase chain reaction, cloning, and sequencing, although the biological relevance of these changes is not always apparent.

For example, ICH has shown how loss of the intercellular adhesion molecule E-cadherin, or abnormal localisation from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm, correlates with a diffuse tumour phenotype and a less favourable clinical outcome. Similarly, ICH of β-catenin (a protein that binds E-cadherin and is essential for its function) has shown abnormal cellular localisation in the nucleus {{in a variety of}} human malignancies; in particular, colorectal carcinomas, where abnormal forms of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene product cause nuclear and cytoplasmic sequestration of β-catenin.

40|$|Ecotropic viral {{integration}} site 1 (EVI 1) is an oncogenic dual domain zinc finger transcription factor that plays {{an essential role}} in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell renewal, and its overexpression in myeloid leukemia and epithelial cancers is associated with poor patient survival. Despite the discovery of EVI 1 in 1988 and its emerging role as a <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogene</b> in various types of cancer, few EVI 1 target genes are known. This lack of knowledge has precluded a clear understanding of exactly how EVI 1 contributes to cancer. Using a combination of ChIP-Seq and microarray studies in human ovarian carcinoma cells, we show that the two zinc finger domains of EVI 1 bind to DNA independently and regulate different sets of target genes. Strikingly, an enriched fraction of EVI 1 target genes are cancer genes or genes associated with cancer. We also show that more than 25 % of EVI 1 -occupied genes contain linked EVI 1 and activator protein (AP) 1 DNA binding sites, and this finding provides evidence for a synergistic cooperative interaction between EVI 1 and the AP 1 family member FOS in the regulation of cell adhesion, proliferation, and colony formation. An increased number of dual EVI 1 /AP 1 target genes are also differentially regulated in late-stage ovarian carcinomas, further confirming the importance of the functional cooperation between EVI 1 and FOS.

To investigate {{the significance of}} these functions in vivo, we generated a knock-in mouse in which four amino acid substitutions in the cdkn 1 b gene product prevent its interaction with cyclins and CDKs (p 27 CK-). In striking contrast to complete deletion of the cdkn 1 b gene, which causes spontaneous tumorigenesis only in the pituitary, the p 27 CK- protein dominantly caused hyperplastic lesions and tumors in multiple organs, including the lung, retina, pituitary, ovary, adrenals, spleen, and lymphomas. Moreover, the high incidence of spontaneous tumors in the lung and retina was associated with amplification of stem/progenitor cell populations. Therefore, independently of its role as a CDK inhibitor, p 27 Kip 1 promoted stem cell expansion and functioned as a <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogene</b> in vivo. Thus, the p 27 CK- mouse unveils a dual role for p 27 during tumorigenesis: It is a tumor suppressor by virtue of its cyclin-CDK regulatory function, and also an oncogene through a cyclin-CDK-independent function. This may explain why the cdkn 1 b gene is rarely inactivated in human tumors, and the p 27 CK- mouse in which the tumor suppressor function is lost but the cyclin-CDK-independent-oncogenic-function is maintained may represent a more faithful model for the widespread role of p 27 misregulation in human cancers than the p 27 null...|$|E

We have developed a monoclonal antibody to p 53 designated PAb 240 which does not immunoprecipitate wild type p 53. A series of different p 53 mutants all react more strongly with PAb 240 than with PAb 246. The PAb 240 reactive form of p 53 cannot bind to SV 40 large T antigen but does bind to HSP 70. In contrast, the PAb 246 form binds to T antigen but not to HSP 70. PAb 240 recognizes all forms of p 53 when they are denatured. It reacts with all mammalian p 53 and chicken p 53 in immunoblots. We propose that immunoprecipitation of p 53 by PAb 240 is diagnostic of mutation in both murine and human systems and suggest that the different point mutations which convert p 53 from a recessive to a <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogene</b> exert a common conformational effect on the protein. This conformational change abolishes T antigen binding and promotes self-oligomerization. These {{results are consistent with}} a dominant negative model where mutant p 53 protein binds to and neutralizes the activity of p 53 in the wild type conformation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{our studies}} was to {{determine}} whether the phenotype of the anaplastic thyroid carcinomas is dominant or recessive. In fact, it is hypothesized, on the basis of epidemiological and pathological data, that undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas are derived from differentiated tumours through a mechanism of tumour progression. Cell hybrids have been generated by cell fusion of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines, which show a highly malignant phenotype, to cell lines deriving from differentiated thyroid carcinoma, which show a non-tumorigenic or a poorly tumorigenic phenotype. All of the parental cell lines showed impaired p 53 gene function. The cell hybrids contained alleles from the parental cell lines. All of the cell hybrids showed a lower growth rate compared with the parental undifferentiated carcinoma cell lines and were unable to grow in soft agar and to induce tumours after injection into athymic mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that the highly malignant phenotype of the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is achieved by the impairment of gene functions that negatively regulate cell growth, rather than by the activation of <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogenes...</b>|$|R
40|$|SummaryEvi- 1 {{has been}} {{recognized}} as one of the <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogenes</b> associated with murine and human myeloid leukemia. Here, we show that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in Evi- 1 -deficient embryos are severely reduced in number with defective proliferative and repopulating capacity. Selective ablation of Evi- 1 in Tie 2 + cells mimics Evi- 1 deficiency, suggesting that Evi- 1 function is required in Tie 2 + hematopoietic stem/progenitors. Conditional deletion of Evi- 1 in the adult hematopoietic system revealed that Evi- 1 -deficient bone marrow HSCs cannot maintain hematopoiesis and lose their repopulating ability. In contrast, Evi- 1 is dispensable for blood cell lineage commitment. Evi- 1 +/− mice exhibit the intermediate phenotype for HSC activity, suggesting a gene dosage requirement for Evi- 1. We further demonstrate that disruption of Evi- 1 in transformed leukemic cells leads to significant loss of their proliferative activity both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, Evi- 1 is a common and critical regulator essential for proliferation of embryonic/adult HSCs and transformed leukemic cells...|$|R
40|$|Osteosarcoma is a {{malignant}} bone tumor which usually {{occurs in the}} metaphysis of long bones in adolescents or young adults, but the mechanism of disease occurrence is unknown. To examine alterations in the <b>dominant</b> <b>oncogenes</b> in the osteosarcoma and other bone and soft tissue tumors, DNA extracted from 12 bone tumors, 12 soft part tumors and 2 cells lines was hybridized with c-oncogene (c-myc, c-sis, c-raf- 1, c-fos, K-ras 2, c-erbB, c-fms, c-fos). DNA extracted from the same samples was examined with Rb cDNA (p 0. 9 R, p 3. 8 R) probes, the retinoblastoma gene (Rb gene) localized at 13 q 14, to analize whether a recessive mutation is a target in osteosarcoma, and other bone and soft tissue tumors. Amplification of c-myc was observed in 3 cases from 7 osteosarcomas and abnormalities in structure of the Rb gene were found in 4 from 7 osteosarcomas, 2 from 4 MFH, and 1 from 2 Ewing's sarcomas. Both amplification of the c-myc and abnormalities of the Rb gene were observed in 3 osteosarcoma cases. The results indicated that both the Rb gene and c-myc oncogene {{may be involved in}} the initiation of osteosarcoma...|$|R
