40|$|Four {{individuals}} with partial <b>duplications</b> <b>of</b> the long arm of chromosome 18 were analyzed at the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular levels. Two {{of the individuals}} had <b>duplications</b> <b>of</b> the long arm from 18 q 21. 1 -qter because of inheritance of an unbalanced translocation. Both of these individuals displayed the clinical phenotype characteristic of Edwards syndrome. Two other patients had de novo interstitial <b>duplications</b> <b>of</b> 18 q but {{did not have a}} clinical diagnosis of Edwards syndrome. The extent of the duplicated material in each patient was determined initially by using cytogenetic analysis and subsequently with more detailed comparisons of the duplicated regions by using molecular probes derived from a chromosome 18 -specific lambda phage library. The results demonstrated that one of the de novo interstitial duplications that did not result in the Edwards syndrome phenotype had a more proximal breakpoint than that <b>of</b> the partial <b>duplications</b> <b>of</b> the two patients with features of Edwards syndrome. These results suggest that a single critical region for Edwards syndrome in the proximal portion of 18 q is unlikely...|$|R

5|$|The Army and Air Force {{had been}} {{involved}} in interservice fighting over missile systems since they split in 1947. The Army considered surface-to-surface missiles (SSM) an extension of conventional artillery, and surface-to-air designs as the modern replacement for their anti-aircraft artillery. The Air Force considered the nuclear SSM to be an extension of their strategic bombing role, and any sort of long-range anti-aircraft system to be their domain as it would integrate with their fighter fleet. Both forces were developing missiles for both roles, leading to considerable <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> effort which was widely seen as wasteful.|$|E

5|$|The {{periscopes}} {{also had}} problems with their optics: periscope users reported difficulty in refocusing after changing magnification, <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> images, and bands across the field of vision. These problems were attributed to RAN demands that the optical view be the first exposed when a periscope was raised above the water, instead of placing the infrared sensor and single-pulse radar at the head as on other submarines, requiring the optical path to be routed around these components. The periscopes were gradually improved, and were no longer a problem {{by the time the}} fast track submarines entered service.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{mechanism}} for the diversification of venom {{is thought to be}} the <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> gene coding for other tissues, followed by their expression in the venom glands. The proteins then evolved into various venom proteins through natural selection. This process, known as the birth-and-death model, is responsible for several of the protein recruitment events in snake venom. These duplications occurred in a variety of tissue types with a number of ancestral functions. Notable examples include 3FTx, ancestrally a neurotransmitter found in the brain, which has adapted into a neurotoxin that binds and blocks acetylcholine receptors. Another example is phospholipase A2 (PLA2) type IIA, ancestrally involved with inflammatory processes in normal tissue, which has evolved into venom capable of triggering lipase activity and tissue destruction. The change in function of PLA2, in particular, has been well documented; there is evidence of several separate gene duplication events, often associated with the origin of new snake species. Non-allelic homologous recombination (or recombination between DNA sequences that are similar, but not alleles) has been proposed as the mechanism of <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> PLA2 genes in rattlesnakes, as an explanation for its rapid evolution. These venom proteins have also occasionally been recruited back into tissue genes. Protein recruitment events have occurred at different points in the evolutionary history of snakes. For example, the 3FTX protein family is absent in the viperid lineage, suggesting that it was recruited into snake venom after the viperid snakes branched off from the remaining colubroidae.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, {{political}} friction increased {{between the}} Army and the Air Force over the {{close air support}} (CAS) mission. The Air Force asserted that the Cheyenne would infringe on the Air Force's CAS mission {{in support of the}} Army, which had been mandated with the Key West Agreement of 1948. The Department of Defense (DOD) conducted a study that concluded that the Air Force's A-X program, the Marine Corps' Harrier, and the Cheyenne were significantly different that they did not constitute a <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> capabilities. On 22 October 1971, the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on Tactical Air Power conducted hearings to evaluate the CAS mission and the pending programs. The most damaging testimony for the Army's program came from the commander of the Air Force's Tactical Air Command, General William W. Momyer, who cited helicopter casualty statistics of Operation Lam Son 719.|$|E

Ford as governor in 1971, the executive branch had again become unwieldy. 60 departments and 210 boards reported directly to the governor by 1972, and <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> services between departments had created inefficiencies. On January 1, 1973, a plan that Ford had issued in late 1972 took effect, consolidating the departments reporting to him into six program cabinets: Consumer Protection and Regulation, Development, Education and the Arts, Human Resources, Safety and Justice, and Transportation. Ford continued merging departments and reorganizing the executive branch throughout 1973 to the extent that, {{by the end of}} the year, there were only three program cabinets (Development, Education and the Arts, and Consumer Protection and Regulation) and four additional departments (Human Resources, Justice, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, and Transportation).|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well.

5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was for all intents and purposes a new design.|$|E
40|$|Leri–Weill dyschondrosteosis is a pseudoautosomal dominantly-inherited {{skeletal}} dysplasia {{ascribed to}} haploinsufficiency of the SHOX gene caused by deletions, point mutations, or partial <b>duplications</b> <b>of</b> the gene, or to heterozygous deletions upstream or downstream of the intact SHOX gene involving conserved non-coding cis-regulatory DNA elements that show enhancer activity. Recently, two SHOX conserved non-coding element duplications, one upstream and one downstream, {{were reported in}} patients referred with idiopathic short stature. To further evaluate the role <b>of</b> these <b>duplications</b> in SHOX-related disorders, we describe seven patients (five with Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis and two with short stature) all <b>of</b> whom have <b>duplications</b> <b>of</b> part of the upstream or downstream conserved non-coding element regions, identified by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. In addition, we show data from 32 patients with an apparently identical downstream duplication that includes a proposed putative regulatory element (identified by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification or array comparative genome hybridization), which results in a variable phenotype from normal to mild Leri–Weill dyschondrosteosis. These additional data provide further evidence that <b>duplications</b> <b>of</b> upstream and downstream long range cis-regulatory DNA elements {{can result in a}} SHOX-related phenotype. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

5|$|From 1983 to 1985, Cathy A. Paris, then a {{graduate}} student, gathered specimens of A.pedatum from non-serpentine soils in the Midwest and Vermont, and from serpentine soils in New England and Canada, for biosystematic analysis. In 1988, Paris and Michael D. Windham published {{the results of}} this analysis, revealing A.pedatum in North America to be a cryptic species complex. They showed that A.pedatum sensu lato included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in the East. However, not all of the serpentine disjuncts proved to belong to the Western taxon. Several of them, including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be tetraploid, forming a taxon distinguishable from the two diploids. Isozyme banding patterns suggested that the tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between the eastern subspecies of non-serpentine woodlands and the western and serpentine taxon, followed by a <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> the hybrid genome through polyploidy (allowing the chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility). This allotetraploid was also morphologically intermediate between the two taxa, although it more closely resembled the serpentine taxon (hence its referral to var.aleuticum before Paris's work). Paris formally described the tetraploid as a new species, A.viridimontanum, in 1991, and also separated the western and serpentine taxon from A.pedatum as the species A.aleuticum. The type specimen of A.viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at the old asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several chloroplast DNA loci has revealed that the A.viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of A.aleuticum, suggesting that A.aleuticum was the maternal parent of A.viridimontanum.|$|E

40|$|A {{complete}} {{physical map}} of Escherichia coli K- 12 strain MG 1655 was constructed by digesting chromosomal DNA with the infrequently cutting restriction enzymes NotI, SfiI and XbaI and separating the fragments by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The map {{was used to}} compare six K- 12 strains of E. coli. Although several differences were noted and localized, the map of MG 1655 was representative of all the K- 12 strains tested. The maps were also used to analyze chromosomal rearrangements in the E. coli strain MG 1655. The spontaneous and UV induced frequencies <b>of</b> tandem <b>duplication</b> formation were measured at several loci distributed around the chromosome. The spontaneous duplication frequency varied from 10 - 5 to 10 - 3 and increased at least ten-fold following mild UV irradiation treatment. <b>Duplications</b> <b>of</b> several regions of the chromosome, including the serA region and the metE region, were mapped using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. <b>Duplications</b> <b>of</b> serA were found to be large, ranging in size from 600 kb to 2100 kb. Several <b>of</b> the <b>duplications</b> isolated at serA were caused by ectopic recombination between IS 5 elements and between IS 186 elements. <b>Duplications</b> <b>of</b> the metE region, however, were almost exclusively the result of ectopic recombination between ribosomal RNA cistrons. Duplication frequencies were determined at both serA and metE in wild type and mismatch repair mutant strains (mutL, mutS, uvrD and recF). Even though all of the mismatch repair mutations increased <b>duplication</b> frequency <b>of</b> metE, the largest increases were observed in the mutL and mutS strains. <b>Duplication</b> frequency <b>of</b> serA was increased less dramatically by mutations in mismatch repair. Several <b>duplications</b> <b>of</b> metE isolated in a wild type and a mismatch repair mutant were mapped. The results showed that the same repeated sequences were used for duplication formation in the mismatch repair mutant as were used in the wild type strain. Several isolates showed evidence of multiple rearrangements indicating that mismatch repair {{may play a role in}} stabilizing the genome by controlling chromosomal rearrangement. ...|$|R
