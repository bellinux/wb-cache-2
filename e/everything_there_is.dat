He would issue video game challenges and answered questions on cheats and tips. The show's host, Dominik Diamond, claimed that Moore did not understand anything that he said on the show, yet managed to record his contributions in single takes.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{executive}} order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.... There should be a level playing field, where no one has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, simply because they know me or anyone else in government.... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> to know about a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official {{must be prepared to}} defend every contract on its merits.|$|E

25|$|The Principle of Rhythm {{expresses the}} idea that in <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{manifested}} a measured motion, a to and from, a flow and inflow, a swing backward and forward, a pendulum-like movement. There is rhythm between every pair of opposites, or poles, and {{is closely related to}} the Principle of Polarity. It can be seen that this Principle enables transition from one pole to the other, and not necessarily poles of extreme opposites.|$|E
25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> to know about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, {{what it was like to}} see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.|$|E
25|$|After Hazumu's {{change into}} a girl, she {{is shown in}} the anime as {{completely}} clueless about basic matters related to being a girl such as feminine modesty, how she walks, talks, and handles herself throughout the day. In the manga, this is shown to a much lesser extent and Hazumu is able to adjust to living like a girl much quicker and with less direct interference from others than in the anime. In the anime, Tomari tries to teach Hazumu <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> about being a girl, but in the manga she is very reluctant to the fact that Hazumu's sex has changed and tries to help her as little as possible in becoming more feminine. Hazumu's personality in the manga is more direct than her anime counterpart, such as when expressing outward annoyance towards her parents' eccentric behaviors, and Hitoshi's awkwardly straightforward interferences in her love life. Also, during the day at the beach in the manga version, Hazumu seeks out Asuta when she is being hit on by two guys and asserts that Asuta is her boyfriend, but in the anime Asuta takes the role of Hazumu's protector and asserts that she is his girlfriend.|$|E

500|$|For {{their third}} Columbia single, the Byrds {{initially}} intended {{to release a}} cover of Dylan's [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] (it was even premiered on the California radio station KRLA), but instead they decided to record [...] "Turn! Turn! Turn! (to <b>Everything</b> <b>There</b> <b>Is</b> a Season)", a Pete Seeger composition with lyrics adapted almost entirely from the biblical Book of Ecclesiastes. [...] The song {{was brought to the}} group by McGuinn, who had previously arranged it in a chamber-folk style while working on folksinger Judy Collins' 1963 album, Judy Collins 3. [...] The Byrds' cover of [...] "Turn! Turn! Turn! (to <b>Everything</b> <b>There</b> <b>Is</b> a Season)" [...] was issued on October 1, 1965 and became the band's second U.S. number 1 single, as well as the title track for their second album. [...] The single represented the high-water mark of folk rock as a chart trend and has been described by music historian Richie Unterberger as [...] "folk rock's highest possible grace note." [...] In addition, music critic William Ruhlmann has noted that the song's lyrical message of peace and tolerance struck a nerve with the American record buying public as the Vietnam War continued to escalate.|$|E
500|$|McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman all {{returned}} to their individual solo careers following the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony. [...] However, the Byrds did reunite {{for a third time}} on August 8, 2000, to give an impromptu, one-off performance at a tribute concert for Fred Walecki, the owner of a Los Angeles music equipment store who was suffering from throat cancer. [...] Crosby and Hillman were booked to appear at the event separately, but McGuinn, who was not listed on the bill, made a surprise appearance and joined his two former partners on stage. [...] McGuinn introduced the hastily reformed trio with the words, [...] "And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Byrds", as the group launched into renditions of [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] and [...] "Turn! Turn! Turn! (to <b>Everything</b> <b>There</b> <b>Is</b> a Season)". [...] According to contemporary press reports, the reunion was an unmitigated success, with the audience giving the band multiple standing ovations and shouting for more as they left the stage.|$|E

500|$|On January 16, 1991, {{the five}} {{original}} {{members of the}} Byrds put aside their differences to appear together at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. [...] The ceremony honored the original line-up of Roger McGuinn, Gene Clark, David Crosby, Chris Hillman, and Michael Clarke, while later configurations of the group featuring such key personnel as Gram Parsons and Clarence White were quietly passed over. [...] The occasion, which saw the band come together on stage to perform the songs [...] "Turn! Turn! Turn! (to <b>Everything</b> <b>There</b> <b>Is</b> a Season)", [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", and [...] "I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better", represented {{the first time that}} all five original Byrds had stood together since 1973. [...] Unfortunately, it would also represent the last time that the five original members were gathered together. [...] Clark died later that year of heart failure, and on December 19, 1993, Clarke succumbed to liver disease brought on by alcoholism.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds had {{initially}} come to international prominence in mid-1965, when their folk rock interpretation of Bob Dylan's [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] reached number 1 {{on both the}} U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart. [...] Further commercial successes followed, with the band releasing two hit albums and reaching number 1 {{for a second time}} in the U.S., with a cover version of Pete Seeger's [...] "Turn! Turn! Turn! (to <b>Everything</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> a Season)". [...] Throughout the latter half of 1965, the band enjoyed tremendous popularity among teenage pop fans and their music received widespread airplay on Top 40 radio. [...] In early 1966, the Byrds' principal songwriter, Gene Clark, departed the band, leaving Jim McGuinn, David Crosby, Chris Hillman, and Michael Clarke to complete the band's third album, Fifth Dimension, without him. [...] Upon release, Fifth Dimension received a mixed critical reception and was less commercially successful than the band's earlier albums. [...] As a result, the Byrds' popularity began to wane and by late 1966, they had been all but forgotten by mainstream pop audiences.|$|E
500|$|There were complaints, however, {{that the}} {{documentary}} did not depict {{enough of the}} political aspects of the Iraqi War. Farhi said, [...] "The 90-minute documentary doesn't say much about the larger issues facing Iraq, but it does capture some small and captivating human stories.... They happen to live in what one boy describes as 'the most dangerous city on Earth.' You don't see much of Iraq's violence in Baghdad High, but you surely feel its gravity and their dread." [...] The Boston Heralds Mark Perigard said that he felt the documentary was [...] "a personal story, not a political one". In The New York Times, Mike Hale commented, [...] "While the boys talk frequently about violence and despair, they rarely discuss politics or ethnic differences ({{with the exception of}} Anmar, the Christian) and they almost never directly address the American presence. We do hear some parental opinions, which are surprisingly neutral. One mother says: 'We shouldn't blame the Americans for <b>everything.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> something wrong with us too'." [...] Jennifer Marin, a culture columnist from the Los Angeles Times, wrote at About.com, that while it was innovative, informative and a noble experiment, the footage is [...] "undistinguished and rough because the hands holding the cameras weren't skilled and the eyes framing the shots were not those of artists or keen observers." [...] She thought that, with the exception of Mohammad, the boys lacked charisma, and that the film failed to capture the drama of living in a war-zone, {{due to the lack of}} a director calling the shots. Perigard said, [...] "After the time you've invested , it's not nearly satisfying enough. For all the questions this fascinating film raises, it might as well be written in sand." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{garnered}} {{a largely}} positive reception from critics. Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "Powerfully depicts both Mulder's gnawing sense of defeat and his bond with Scully, strangely growing stronger with separation" [...] before concluding that the episode was [...] "fairly standard." [...] The site ultimately gave the episode a B. Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club positively compared and contrasted the episode to the cartoon Scooby Doo, Where Are You? writing that, [...] "I {{used to be a}} huge [...] "Scooby Doo" [...] fan. [...] Of course, none of [...] were really monsters. [...] The X-Files exploited a simple truth: we all want to believe. We might be afraid of what's lurking in the dark, but isn't there always a bit of wishing inside that fear? A hope that what we think we know isn't <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> to know. That just once it might be nice to reach for a zipper and instead find nothing but cool scales." [...] Handlen ultimately called the episode [...] "Essential." [...] Reviewer Dan Barrett from the 400 Club wrote that [...] "The X-Files is off to a stonking good start with this season 2 opening." [...] Bob Curtright, writing for the Los Angeles Daily News, called the episode [...] "an engrossing chiller about potential contact from outer space." [...] He compared the episode positively to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and noted that the episode was [...] "both scary and wondrous" [...] and [...] "offer no pat answers that might tend to blow the credibility." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, writing that the episode was not [...] "what the fans were expecting, and its reputation isn't great. But I think this clever and claustrophobic little take, which does so much not only to refresh the show but to analyze what it's actually about, is one of the very best." ...|$|E
