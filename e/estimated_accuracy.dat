40|$|What are {{the common}} methods for <b>estimating</b> <b>accuracy</b> of {{classifiers}} induced by supervised learning algorithms? Based on evidence from literature and your hands-on experience (if any), {{comment on the}} strengths and weaknesses of each approach and its scope of application. Answer <b>Estimating</b> <b>accuracy</b> of learned classifiers is an important problem in machine learning for at least three reasons. First, how accurate a classifier is to a large extent determines how useful it is. An <b>estimate</b> of the <b>accuracy</b> gives an indication of whether to use the classifier for a particular problem and how much confidence to have in its classifications. For example, an accurate classifier can aid doctors in medical diagnosis, while a inaccurate one can be dangerous. Second, <b>accuracy</b> <b>estimates</b> of a learned classifier is part of the learning process of most learning algorithms. Third, a comparing the accuracy of classifiers produced by learning algorithms is important to researchers for understanding and developing learning algorithms. There are several common methods for <b>estimating</b> <b>accuracy.</b> All such methods are necessarily heuristic, in the sense that they require assumptions about the classifier or the classification problem, and can fail if the assumptions are wrong.

40|$|We propose an {{efficient}} method to <b>estimate</b> the <b>accuracy</b> of classifiers using only unlabeled data. We consider a setting with multiple classification problems where the target classes may be tied together through logical constraints. For example, {{a set of}} classes may be mutually exclusive, meaning that a data instance can belong to at most one of them. The proposed method {{is based on the}} intuition that: (i) when classifiers agree, {{they are more likely to}} be correct, and (ii) when the classifiers make a prediction that violates the constraints, at least one classifier must be making an error. Experiments on four real-world data sets produce <b>accuracy</b> <b>estimates</b> within a few percent of the true accuracy, using solely unlabeled data. Our models also outperform existing state-of-the-art solutions in both <b>estimating</b> <b>accuracies,</b> and combining multiple classifier outputs.

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, some {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to estimate null values in relational database systems. However, the <b>estimated</b> <b>accuracy</b> of the existing methods are not good enough. In this paper, we present a new method to generate weighted fuzzy rules from relational database systems for estimating null values using genetic algorithms (GAs), where the attributes appearing in the antecedent part of generated fuzzy rules have different weights. After a predefined number of evolutions of the GA, the best chromosome contains the optimal weights of the attributes, {{and they can be}} translated into a set of rules to be used for estimating null values. The proposed method can get a higher average <b>estimated</b> <b>accuracy</b> rate than the methods we presented in two previous papers.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to estimate}} in-bank river discharge exclusively from remotely sensed hydraulic data is developed. Water-surface width and maximum channel width measured from 26 aerial and digital orthophotos of 17 single channel rivers and 41 SAR images of three braided rivers were coupled with channel slope {{data obtained from}} topographic maps to estimate the discharge. The standard error of the discharge estimates were within a factor of 1. 5 – 2 (50 – 100 %) of the observed, with the mean <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy</b> within 10 %. This level of accuracy was achieved using calibration functions developed from observed discharge. The calibration functions use reach specific geomorphic variables, the maximum channel width and the channel slope, to predict a correction factor. The calibration functions are related to channel type. Surface velocity and width information, obtained from a single C-band image obtained by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL’s) AirSAR was also used to estimate discharge for a reach of the Missouri River. Without using a calibration function, the <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy</b> was C 72 % of the observed discharge, which is within the expected range of uncertainty for the method. However, using the observed velocity to calibrate the initial estimate improved the <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy</b> to within C 10 % of the observed.
