5|$|In 1935, a town {{planning}} {{report for the}} City of Perth noted traffic congestion on Albany Road in Victoria Park. As widening the existing road would <b>have</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> council liable for compensation from affected businesses and properties, the provision of bypass routes was recommended instead. To provide the bypasses, parallel roads would be upgraded and extended: Berwick Street to the south-west, and Shepparton Road to the north-east.|$|E
5|$|In 2007–2008, the {{promenade}} hosted five sculptures made by Mark di Suvero, hosted at the smaller Boeing Galleries. Chicago Tribune art critic, Alan G.

He felt the Chase Promenade might have served as a better forum and would <b>have</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> artist unfettered to choose from a wider range of pieces.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second Intifada and the resulting decrease in tourism also affected the Christian minority, since they are the owners of many Bethlehem hotels and services that cater to foreign tourists.

Since the Second Intifada, 10% of the Christian population <b>have</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E

However, on 14 October 2004 Mambo announced she was leaving the group amidst widespread media coverage of her being pregnant outside of wedlock. Reports indicated that she may <b>have</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> group because of Maia's more dominant personality and conflicts between the two. Maia, left as {{the only member of the}} band, insisted that it was not dissolving, and would soon hold auditions for a new vocalist. As a temporary measure, several singers were contracted to perform with Maia, although not signed as members. Tia, a finalist in Akademi Fantasi Indosiar (AFI), came under consideration for the position, but was unable to accept as she was still contracted to AFI.|$|E

5|$|Emigration {{of young}} people {{continued}} apace with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to <b>have</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks {{of family and friends}} who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E

5|$|Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, {{intervened in}} an attempt to produce a {{negotiated}} solution.

5|$|In 1942, {{during the}} Second World War, Allied {{aircraft}} construction saw the UK of necessity concentrating on heavy bombers, leaving {{the production of}} transport aircraft to the USA. This would <b>have</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> UK with little experience in transport construction {{at the end of}} the war, so in 1943, a committee under Lord Brabazon of Tara investigated the future of the British civilian airliner market. The Brabazon Committee called for several different aircraft to be developed to specifications composed by the committee for roles felt to fulfil Britain's civilian aviation needs.|$|E

Back in Belgium, Tintin realises that Sir Francis' message referred, not to the location of the Unicorn, but to a globe mounted on a statue in Sir Francis' former country home. Understanding now that Francis would never <b>have</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> treasure but would have taken it with him to his home, Tintin locates the coordinates to the treasure on the globe, presses a secret button he finds there, and discovers Red Rackham's treasure hidden inside.|$|E
5|$|Initial extrapolations placed Cooper's {{landing zone}} within an {{area on the}} southernmost {{outreach}} of Mount St. Helens, a few miles southeast of Ariel, Washington, near Lake Merwin, an artificial lake formed by a dam on the Lewis River. Search efforts focused on Clark and Cowlitz Counties, encompassing the terrain immediately south and north, respectively, of the Lewis River in southwest Washington. FBI agents and Sheriff's deputies from those counties searched {{large areas of the}} mountainous wilderness on foot and by helicopter. Door-to-door searches of local farmhouses were also carried out. Other search parties ran patrol boats along Lake Merwin and Yale Lake, the reservoir immediately to its east. No trace of Cooper, nor any of the equipment presumed to <b>have</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> aircraft with him, was found.|$|E
