For systems that only support 8.3 filenames, excess characters are ignored and if a file name has no extension, the , if present, has no significance (that is, [...] and [...] are equivalent). Furthermore, in these systems file and directory names are uppercase, although systems that use the 8.3 standard are usually case-insensitive (hence [...] will be equivalent to the name [...] ). However, on non-8.3 Operating Systems (such as almost any modern operating systems) accessing 8.3 File Systems (including DOS-formatted diskettes, but also including some modern memory cards and networked file systems) the underlying system may alter filenames internally to preserve case and avoid truncating letters in the names, for example {{in the case of}} VFAT.|$|R

This generalized Austrian model of production takes into account that end of the period capital stocks result from: (i) purchases of new investment goods; (ii) internal construction of firm capital stock components and (iii) holdings of (depreciated) capital goods that were held by the firm {{at the beginning of the}} period. These different methods of creating end of period holdings of capital stocks generally have different resource requirements and hence the one period production possibilities set is more complex than the usual one. This general model of production is used to justify the decomposition of the Jorgensonian user cost of capital into separate waiting services and depreciation components.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that endolithic photo- autotrophs inside {{the skeleton of}} cold-water corals may have a mutualistic relationship with the coral host posi- tively affecting coral calcification. This study investigated the effect of endolithic photo-autotrophs on the apical septal <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the cold-water coral Desmophyllum dianthus at Fjord Comau, southern Chile (42. 41 °– 42. 15 °S, 72. 5 °W). The fluorescent staining agent calcein was used to document the linear apical <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> septae for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> one and <b>a</b> half years between 2006 and 2007.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that endolithic algae inside the skeleton of cold-water corals might have a symbiotic relationship with the coral host and would positively affect coral calcification. However, so far this hypothesis has not yet been further explored. This study investigated the effect of endolithic algae on the growth performance and skeletal density of the cold-water coral Desmophyllum dianthus at Fjord Comau, southern Chile. The fluorescent staining agent calcein was used to document coral growth by measuring the upward linear <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> septa for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> one and <b>a</b> half years. Observations on skeletal density were recorded using x-ray computed tomography. The results of this study show <b>a</b> severe reduction <b>of</b> growth rates associated with the presence of endolithic algae. Infested individuals grew about half as fast as non-infested polyps with median value of 1. 18 μm/day compared to 2. 76 μm/day. Data on skeletal density revealed a similar – although not statistically significant – trend displaying mean values of 2. 160 g/cm³ compared to 2. 294 g/cm³, respectively. These results point towards a parasitic relationship between D. dianthus and its endolithic algae refuting the hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mutually beneficial association. However, although this study appears to conclusively indicate <b>a</b> negative effect <b>of</b> the association of D. dianthus with endolithic algae, controversial evidence has been discovered regarding the mode of the relationship. Despite the decrease in growth performance, the coral host seems to benefit from <b>a</b> low transfer <b>of</b> metabolites from the endoliths to the coral tissue.
