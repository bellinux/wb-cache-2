40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the operations problems in non-profit hospital <b>call</b> centers with <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>calls</b> service blending. First, the routing policy for <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>calls</b> is considered. The objective {{is to improve the}} system utilization under constraints of service quality and operators 2 ̆ 7 quantity. A collection of practical staffing assignment methods, separating and mixing staffing policy are evaluated. Erlang C queuing model is used to decide the minimum number of operators required by <b>inbound</b> <b>calls.</b> Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments illustrate that through dynamically assigning the <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>calls</b> to operators under optimal threshold policy, mixing staffing policy is efficient to balance the system utilization and service quality. Numerical experiments based on real-life data demonstrate how this method can be applied in practice. Second, we study the staffing shift planning problem based on the <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>calls</b> routing policies. A mathematical programming model is developed, based on a hospital call center with one kind of <b>inbound</b> <b>calls</b> and multiple kinds of outbound calls. The objective is to minimize the staffing numbers, by deciding the shift setting and workload allocation. The <b>inbound</b> <b>calls</b> service level and staffing utilization are taken into consideration in the constraints. Numerical experiments based on actual operational data are included. Results show that the model is effective to optimize the shift planning and hence reduce the call centers 2 ̆ 7 cost. Third, we model the staffing shift planning problem for a hospital call center with two kinds of service lines. Each kind of service is delivered through both <b>inbound</b> <b>calls</b> and outbound <b>calls.</b> The <b>inbound</b> <b>calls</b> can be transferred between these two service lines. A mathematical programming model is developed. The objective is to minimize the staffing cost, by deciding the shift setting and workload allocation. The <b>inbound</b> <b>calls</b> service level and staffing utilization are taken into consideration in the constraints. Numerical experiments are carried out based on actual operational data. Results show that the model is effective to reduce the call centers 2 ̆ 7 labor cost...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of {{multi-channel}} <b>call</b> centers with <b>inbound</b> <b>calls</b> and emails, we consider a threshold policy on the reservation of agents for the <b>inbound</b> <b>calls.</b> We study a general non-stationary model where calls arrive according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process. The optimization problem consists of maximizing the throughput of emails under a constraint on the waiting time of <b>inbound</b> <b>calls.</b> We propose an efficient adaptive threshold policy that is easy to implement in the Automatic Call Distributor (ACD). This scheduling policy is evaluated through a comparison with the optimal performance measures found {{in the case of}} a constant arrival rate, and also a comparison with other intuitive adaptive threshold policies in the general non-stationary case...|$|R

50|$|Inbound {{calls to}} a customer's Flowroute account can be routed via SIP URI, host, or phone number. Depending on {{their choice of}} {{subscription}} plan, customers can choose to have either unlimited <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> channels and pay only for the minutes used, or have a fixed number of inbound channels but receive unlimited minutes at a more predictable rate.|$|E
50|$|In WAS z/OS V7 the WOLA {{support for}} SMF {{was limited to}} inbound calls only. Inbound WOLA calls to target EJBs in the WAS z/OS {{container}} were identified as IIOP calls and captured by SMF as IIOP calls, indistinguishable from any other IIOP call. The normal WAS z/OS SMF 120 subtype 9 record (or 120.9 in shorthand notation) was used to capture the <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> information.|$|E
50|$|A {{call centre}} or call {{center is a}} {{centralised}} office used for receiving or transmitting a large volume of requests by telephone. An <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> centre is operated by a company to administer incoming product support or information enquiries from consumers. Outbound call centres are operated for telemarketing, solicitation of charitable or political donations, debt collection and market research. A contact centre is a location for centralised handling of individual communications, including letters, faxes, live support software, social media, instant message, and e-mail.|$|E
40|$|International calls include {{consumption}} and financial externalities. Theoretical analysis {{predicts that the}} volume of outbound and <b>inbound</b> <b>calls</b> {{is a function of}} originating-country price ("own-price") and terminating-country price ("cross-price"). Analysis of annual data for minutes of calling between the U. S. and seventeen West European countries from 1979 to 1986 reveals negative own-price effects in both directions, with <b>inbound</b> <b>calls</b> more elastic. Cross-price effects are generally not statistically significant. The findings are consistent with arbitrage and call-externality motivation that cancel each other. Level of GDP, number of telephones, and telex prices are statistically significant. Copyright 1992 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

50|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, South Africa and {{particularly}} the Cape Town region has established itself as a successful call centre and business process outsourcing destination. With a highly talented pool of productive labour and with Cape Town sharing cultural affinity with Britain, large overseas firms such as Lufthansa, Amazon.com, ASDA, The Carphone Warehouse, Delta Airlines and many more have established <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> centres within Cape Town {{as a means of}} utilising Cape Town's low labour costs and talented labour force.|$|E
50|$|Clickthrough {{rates of}} Interactive Reverse RingBack Tones are {{reported}} {{at an average}} of 2.5% with a wide variance from 0% up to 7.5%, depending on the offering of the advertisement itself.In 2009, Nielsen Mobile estimated that an average U.S. mobile subscriber receives about 4 calls per day, which places the total <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> volume of 3 billion global mobile subscribers at approximately 12 billion inbound calls per day, a figure that has remained more or less steady for the past few years. Based on the total <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> volume, the global opportunity for Ad‐RBTs is immense. For example, if just twelve million mobile subscribers used Ad‐RBTs to advertise a favorite product or organization, RingBack Tone advertising would be delivering approximately 48 million paid advertisements per day, a figure slightly higher than Google’s pay‐per‐click search advertising interactions per day on the web. Furthermore, Ad‐RBTs are a mobile experience that is always shared between users, giving it the potential to expand virally if Ad‐RBT content is engaging, interesting, funny, or relates to brands or causes that people are passionate about. Therefore, it is important that ad content is brief and efficient, exciting and playful, or practical and need‐specific to increase consumer acceptance and interaction and reduce churn rate.|$|E
50|$|Virtual queuing is {{a concept}} used in <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> centers. Call centers use an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) to {{distribute}} incoming calls to specific resources (agents) in the center. ACDs hold queued calls in First In, First Out order until agents become available. From the caller’s perspective, without virtual queuing they have only two choices: wait until an agent resource becomes available, or abandon (hang up) and try again later. From the call center’s perspective, a long queue results in many abandoned calls, repeat attempts, and customer dissatisfaction.|$|E
50|$|A Zenith {{number was}} {{typically}} available from a predefined area, {{anything from a}} few nearby cities to a province or state, and was listed in local directories in each community from which the subscriber was {{willing to accept the}} charges for <b>inbound</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Grade {{of service}} is the {{probability}} of a call in a circuit group being blocked or delayed for more than a specified interval, expressed as a vulgar fraction or decimal fraction. This is always with reference to the busy hour when the traffic intensity is the greatest. Grade of service may be viewed independently from the perspective of incoming versus outgoing calls, and is not necessarily equal in each direction or between different source-destination pairs. [...] "Grade of Service" [...] sometimes means a measure of <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> center traffic to verify adherence to conditions to measure the success of customers served.|$|E
50|$|Under the North American Numbering Plan, {{almost all}} North American area codes reserve {{telephone}} numbers beginning with 958 and 959 for internal local and long distance testing (respectively), sometimes called plant testing. (One exception is Winnipeg, which reserves 959 only). Numbers within this block {{are used for}} various test utilities such as a ringback number (to test the ringer when installing telephone sets), milliwatt tone (a number simply answers with a continuous test tone) and a loop around (which connects a call to another <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> to the same or another test number). ANAC numbers can also appear in the 958 range, {{but there is no}} requirement that they reside there.|$|E
50|$|Call whisper, {{otherwise}} known as call screening, is a calling feature that often appears on non-geographic telephony systems and hosted <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> handling software. It involves the playing of {{a message to the}} called party when they have answered a call, during which time the calling party continues to hear ringing. The called party can then decide whether to accept the call (usually by pressing a particular key whereupon the call will be put through to them) or to reject it (either by pressing a key or simply hanging up). They can also identify the caller by their caller ID number or answer the phone in an appropriate manner for the number that has been dialed.|$|E
