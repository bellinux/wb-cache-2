40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} the Panama brief squid was evaluated using reproductive indicators, and histological and histochemical analyses. A total of 2, 460 squid were analyzed, which were captured during 15 <b>exploratory</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>surveys</b> in the Gulf of California during 2003 to 2006 and 2008. Of the total sample, 61 % were female, 15 % were male, {{and the rest}} were undifferentiated. Based on {{the frequency of the}} gonad developmental stages, the largest number of mature females was identified in February and October, whereas mature males were found in April and August. This result coincided with the gonadosomatic index. According to the histological analyses, we characterized 4 stages of oogenesis: previtellogenesis, vitellogenesis, postvitellogenesiswith mature oocytes, and postspawning. We also characterized 6 substages of oocyte and 2 structural indicators of spawning: oogonia (Po 0), previtellogenic oocyte primary (Po 1), previtellogenic oocyte secondary (Po 2), vitellogenic primary oocyte (Vo 1), secondary vitellogenic oocyte (Vo 2), postvitellogenic oocyte (Pvo), postovulatory follicles, and atresia. Oocyte size among types showed significant differences (P < 0. 05). The presence of postovulatory follicles, and oocytes of different sizes and various developmental stages throughout the study period indicates that the Panama brief squid has a synchronous ovarian development with multiple spawning. The size at first maturity (L 50) indicates that males (mantle length, 51 mm) mature at lengths shorter than females (mantle length, 85 mm) ...|$|E
40|$|The Rockall Trough or Channel is {{a clearly}} delimited {{deepwater}} area {{lying to the}} west of the British Isles. The eastern and western boundaries are formed by the continental margin and the Rockall Plateau, respectively. To the north it is separated from the colder Norwegian Sea by a ridge at about 500 m depth. To the south the depth steadily increases to abyssal depths. Some of the earliest descriptions of deep-water fishes are from this area in the 1860 s and 1870 s. The UK and Germany carried out deep-water <b>exploratory</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>surveys</b> in the 1970 s and 1980 s and detailed biological studies by the Scottish Association for Marine Science began in 1975. Although some deep-water fishing began in the 1970 s the rapid increase in commercial exploitation did not begin until 1989. As a result there is information on the fish populations and their biology that pre-date the fishery. Since then several countries have carried out research surveys in the area and there has been some monitoring of landings and discards. There are documented concerns about the vulnerability of the fish stocks since 1993 and ICES considers them to be outside safe biological limits. The most recent ICES advice is for a 50 % reduction in fishing effort for the main species. Despite ICES advice the fishery remains unregulated. This paper describes the transition from what is probably one of the best-studied deep-water ecosystems to an are...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Seamounts are {{vulnerable}} marine ecosystems. In Chile, {{information on these}} ecosystems is quite scarce; thus, a compilation of information on their geographical distribution and biodiversity is presented herein. A total of 118 seamounts distributed in the Chilean EEZ are identified and characterized. Additionally, an in situ assessment was carried out on the Juan Fernandez seamounts 1 and 2 (JF 1 and JF 2), which were also oceanographically characterized. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, and marine invertebrate samples were collected and an <b>exploratory</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>survey</b> was executed using different gears. According to the bibliographical review, a total of 82 species have been collected on the JF 1 and JF 2 seamounts, highlighting findings of black coral species caught in lobster traps at the Juan Fernandez Archipelago. Submarine images of the marine substrate at JF 1 and JF 2 reveal characteristics attributable {{to the impact of}} bottom dredges, coinciding with the informa-tion obtained from the trawling fleet. The fishing activity was carried out primarily at JF 2 (4, 667 km of trawl-ing).

40|$|To provide {{advice to}} {{fisheries}} managers, scientists study both commercially valuable species and species of ecological importance {{in order to}} learn their habits, biology, population dynamics, and ecological role. This data is then processed and interpreted and passed onto managers who use this information to establish yearly catch limits for commercial species. Historically, the large scale commercial fisheries in Newfoundland and Labrador have been based on species that have exhibited high abundance and low biomass. However, as the numbers of commercially valuable fish species continue to decline, harvesters are turning to species that are less abundant and of less commercial value in order to maximise the value of their annual income. In this context, less economic value would be a result of a low price per weight of species harvested, or a high price per weight, but low numbers of species actually harvested. In Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) employs highly skilled and well educated scientists to study the biomass and abundance or formally abundant commercially valuable fishery species, but very few of these researchers are familiar with many of the less commercially valuable species. In {{order to be able to}} set responsible catch limits for these newly harvested species, the DFO must either hire more biologists who are familiar with these species, or develop methodologies which will provide them with the scientific data they require to ensure a sustainable harvest. This will require an integrated management approach, where harvesters will have a means to provide DFO with the data required for a sustainable management plan. [...] The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that traditional ecological knowledge of fish harvesters should continue to be integrated with conventional fisheries research data in the importance of industry involvement during data collection. The resulting information could then be used to help determine if new and emerging fish species of less economic value can sustain a commercially viable fishery. The published paper; An <b>Exploratory</b> <b>Fishing</b> <b>Survey</b> and Biological Resource Assessment of Atlantic Hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) Occurring on the Southwest Slope of the Newfoundland Grand Bank (Grant, 2006) will be used as a case study to emphasize this point...|$|R

Los montes submarinos constituyen ecosistemas marinos vulnerables. Chile presenta una escasa información acerca de estos ecosistemas, por lo que este trabajo recopila información sobre distribución geográfica y biodiversidad. Se identifican y caracterizan 118 montes en la ZEE de Chile. Adicionalmente, una evaluación in situ se desarrolló sobre los montes Juan Fernández 1 y 2 (JF 1, JF 2), caracterizándolos oceanógraficamente. Se recolectaron muestras de fitoplancton, zooplancton e invertebrados marinos, y se realizó pesca exploratoria con diversos artes.

In the surveyed area off St. Lawrence Island the bottom water showed temperature below 0 ℃ in all three years in late July. Near St. Lawrence Island the bottom waters were colder and more saline than those in the offshore region every year. This suggests that coastal upwelling occurred near the island. In the Chukchi Sea, hydrographic conditions near the pack ice showed remarkable two-layer structure consisting of the warmer, fresher upper water and colder, saline lower water. The highest static stability of 40 × 1 O^ m^ existed between the two layers near the pack ice. The strong stratification disappeared in the ice free sea...|$|R
