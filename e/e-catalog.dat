40|$|With {{the wide}} spread of internet, the {{electronic}} commerce (e-commerce) market is rapidly expanding. A web-based <b>e-catalog</b> system {{is used to}} provide e-commerce customers relevant product information. The accurate and timely delivery of product information {{is the key to}} the <b>e-catalog</b> system. This paper describes a systematic approach to generate an <b>e-catalog</b> web page by direct use of design information such as PDM data and 3 D CAD data. The <b>e-catalog</b> generator consists of the data converter and the <b>e-catalog</b> manager. Since the product data stored in PDM systems are difficult to understand for the customers, the data are converted to customer-oriented format. The data that will be provided to the customers are selected and the related technical terminologies are converted to common words. The data converted including images of products, product specifications and product features are stored in the <b>e-catalog</b> database. The <b>e-catalog</b> manager integrates the data in the <b>e-catalog</b> database to generate XML format <b>e-catalog</b> documents. In addition, the <b>e-catalog</b> manager receives 3 D CAD design model, adds texture information, and enables virtual reality simulation of product functions. It is shown that the most up-to-date <b>e-catalog</b> web service can be realized with the least amount of web designer intervention using the <b>e-catalog</b> manager in order to reduce time and cost when new products are released. ...|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of E-commerce, the <b>E-catalog</b> plays as a medium role between buyers and sellers. Sellers could show products information completely to their customers and provide them with purchasing reference through <b>E-catalog.</b> However, <b>E-catalog</b> not only presents product information but also offers different services to customers. This research proposes a personalized <b>E-catalog</b> to enhance users' purchase intention and promote their satisfaction through individualized services. This study adopts questionnaire survey to obtain data. Three hundred and four valid questionnaires are used for statistical analysis, including factor analysis, t-test, correlation analysis, and structural equation model. The study draws the following conclusions: (1) The components comprise personalized <b>E-catalog</b> are interactive and preference mechanisms. (2) The effectiveness of personalized <b>E-catalog</b> could be measured by playfulness, usability, and navigation efficiency. (3) Whether respondents have the experience to use <b>E-catalog</b> or not, there are no significant differences on their perceptions of personalized <b>E-catalog</b> design and effectiveness measurement. (4) The components comprise personalized <b>E-catalog</b> have positive relationship with <b>E-catalog</b> effectiveness. In order to represent the personalized product information in <b>E-catalog,</b> this research reforms a personalized method based on product features. First, the personalized <b>E-catalog</b> system accumulates users' transaction history and navigation behavior records. Second, the system calculates users' preference of product features which comprises the user profile. Third, it generates the possible products that users may be most interested in by matching and computing the similarity level s between products profiles and customer profile. Finally, it displays the products that may attract users in E-catalogs and furthermore achieve the goal of <b>E-catalog</b> personalization. 隨著電子商務的發展，電子型錄始終扮演一個介於買方和賣方一個中介溝通的角色，透過電子型錄，賣方可以將所販賣的商品完整地展示給買方，便利買方購買決策之參考。然而，隨著產品日新月異，電子型錄不再只是單單展現所有的產品資訊，而必須提供給顧客更多的服務。本研究發展一個人化電子型錄系統，期望能透過個人化的服務，提升使用者的購買意願及相對滿意度。 首先，透過問卷調查蒐集上網人口對於個人化電子型錄意見之相關資料，共回收 304 份有效問卷，進行進一步的統計分析：包括因素分析、t檢定、相關分析以及結構方程模型。研究結果如下：(1) 在個人化的電子型錄設計方面，設計的因素包含了互動機制及個人化喜好設定機制；(2) 在衡量個人化電子型錄的績效方面，共可分為“有趣性”，“使用性”和“瀏覽效率”來衡量；(3) 無論有無使用過電子型錄的經驗，受測者對於個人化型錄的設計及績效衡量的態度並無顯著之差異；(4) 個人化電子型錄的設計會影響使用上的有效性。 另外，對於如何展現個人化的產品資訊於電子型錄上，本研究改良了一套以產品特徵為基礎的個人化方法，透過使用者的交易紀錄以及瀏覽行為，計算出使用者對於產品特徵的偏好程度，並建立使用者對於各個產品特徵的偏好檔，最後藉由計算產品特徴檔和使用者對於各個產品偏好檔之間之相似程度。進而展示使用者可能會感興趣產品於個人化電子型錄的頁面中，達到電子型錄個人化的目的。中文摘要 I ABSTRACT II 誌謝 III TABLE OF CONTENTS IV LIST OF FIGURES VII LIST OF TABLES VIII CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 1 1. 1 Background and Motivation 1 1. 2 Objectives 2 1. 3 Research Procedure 4 CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW 6 2. 1 <b>E-catalog</b> 6 2. 1. 1 Definitions 6 2. 1. 2 <b>E-catalog</b> designs 8 2. 2 Personalization 13 2. 3 Personalized Recommendation 14 2. 4 Effectiveness Measurement 16 2. 5 Review and Comparisons of Personalized Web Sites 19 2. 5. 1 Comparisons of Personalized Web Sites 27 2. 6 Summary of <b>E-catalog</b> Literature 31 CHAPTER 3 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY 32 3. 1 The Conceptual Model 32 3. 2 Construction of Measurement 32 3. 2. 1 Design of personalized <b>E-catalog</b> functions 33 3. 2. 2 Measurement of personalized <b>E-catalog</b> effectiveness 34 3. 3 Hypotheses to be Tested 35 3. 4 Questionnaire Design and Sampling Plan 36 3. 5 Data Analysis Procedures 36 CHAPTER 4 DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS 39 4. 1 Descriptive Analysis 39 4. 2 Factor Analysis and Reliability Test 42 4. 2. 1 Personalized <b>E-catalog</b> design 43 4. 2. 2 Personalized <b>E-catalog</b> effectiveness measurement 46 4. 3 Validity Test 49 4. 4 Significant Mean Differences Between Two Groups: The t- Test by <b>E-catalog</b> Experiences 49 4. 5 Interrelationship Between Research Constructs 51 4. 6 Structural Equation Model 52 CHAPTER 5 DESIGN OF A PERSONALIZED <b>E-CATALOG</b> SYSTEM 57 5. 1 Problem Description and Module Design 57 5. 2 Proposed Framework 58 5. 2. 1 The Web user life cycle 58 5. 2. 2 A proposed framework for personalized <b>E-catalog</b> generation 59 5. 3 Product and Customer Profile 61 5. 3. 1 Product profile 61 5. 3. 2 Customer profile 62 5. 4 An Example 64 CHAPTER 6 A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM OF PERSONA- LIZED RODUCTS RECOMMENDATION 69 6. 1 The System Flowchart 69 6. 2 Prototype System 71 6. 2. 1 Front-end user interface 71 6. 2. 2 Navigation recorder 73 6. 3 Transaction History 78 6. 4 Recommendation List 80 CHAPTER 7 CONCLUSIONS AND MANAGERICAL IMPLICATIONS 81 7. 1 Conclusions 81 7. 2 Managerial Implications 85 7. 3 Future Work 86 REFERENCES 88 APPENDIX A : SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE 9...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Electronic catalogs (or <b>e-catalogs),</b> {{like their}} printed counter-parts, hold {{information}} about {{the goods and services}} offered or requested by the market participants and, consequently, form the basis of the in-formation phase of electronic commerce. As electronic malls as well as <b>e-catalogs</b> made by each of them rapidly increase in number, there are some emerging problems in dealing with <b>e-catalogs</b> such as the catalog heterogeneity and the redundant investment in the making of catalogs. In this paper, to achieve catalog interoperability and catalog sharing, we propose an extended catalog model of <b>e-catalogs</b> and present a view-integrated architecture for an electronic catalog library, named Cata-logStop. The Live Catalog in CatalogStop is a virtual catalog that can be bound directly to the contents in the catalog repository or to a query that will retrieve the contents from possibly distributed and heteroge-neous catalog sources using a standard protocol. ...|$|R

However, apart from design frameworks and guidelines for Web-based EC, not much has been done by researchers or practitioners on how electronic catalogs (<b>e-catalogs)</b> influence the users' desirability and satisfaction as purchasers. In this correspondence, we investigate the form of media that represented the most efficient mode to present products to Web users by summarizing and evaluating various existing forms of <b>e-catalogs</b> and their respective responses from Web users. We conclude that a 3 -D virtual object (VO) is the most efficient mode of electronic cataloging for Web interface due to a better sense of presence of users, a more attractive and enjoyable media of delivery of useful information to users, and a higher level of engagement of user's memory. A 3 -D VO, as a result, generates the highest users' satisfaction, which leads to increased propensity to purchase.

40|$|Introduction <b>E-catalog</b> portals, such as Expedia. com and Amazon. com, are {{becoming}} more and more prominent feature of the Web.

It is clearly useful to provide a unified interface to access multiple <b>e-catalog</b> portals. The issue here is that the technology to create, organise, integrate and search these portals has not kept pace with the rapid growth of the available information space. Most existing approaches for providing access to integrated e-catalogs as a portal are based on (i) creating centralised product data repository collected from participating <b>e-catalog</b> providers, (ii) statically linking manually (ad-hoc) identified ecatalogs to the portal.

40|$|International audienceWith {{the rapid}} {{development}} of e-services on the Web, {{increasing number of}} e-catalogs are becoming accessible to users. A large number of e-catalogs provide information about similar type of products/services. To simplify users information searching effort, data integration systems have being developed to integrate e-catalogs providing similar type of information such that users can query those e-catalogs with a mediator through an uniform query interface. The conventional approach to answer a query received by a mediator is to select e-catalogs purely based on their query capabilities, i. e., query interface specifications. However, an <b>e-catalog</b> having the capability to answer a query does not mean it has relevant answers to the query. To remedy the wasted resources of querying catalogs that do not generate an answer, in this paper, we propose to use catalog content summary as a filter and select the relevant e-catalogs to answer a given query based not only on their query capabilities but also on their content relevance to the query. A multi-attribute content (MAC) summary is proposed to describe an <b>e-catalog</b> with respect to its content. With MAC summary, an <b>e-catalog</b> is selected to answer a query only if the <b>e-catalog</b> is likely having answers to the query. MAC summary can be constructed and updated using answers returned from e-catalogs and therefore the e-catalogs need not be cooperative.

A large number of e-commerce stores provide electronic product catalogs that allow customers to search products of interest and store owners to manage various product information. Due to the constant schema evolution and the sparsity of e-commerce data, most commercial e-commerce systems use the so-called vertical schema for data storage. However, query processing for data stored using vertical schema is extremely inefficient because current RDBMSs, especially its cost-based query optimizer, are specifically designed to deal with traditional horizontal schemas. In this paper, we show that <b>e-catalog</b> management can be naturally supported in IBM’s System RX, the first DBMS that truly supports both XML and relational data in their native forms.

A huge quantity of e-catalogs (i. e., information and product portals) is now readily available. Unfortunately, given that e-catalogs are often autonomous and heterogeneous, effectively integrating and querying them is a delicate and timeconsuming task. More importantly, the number of e-catalogs to be integrated and queried may be large and continuously changing.

As the name implies, they are not organized from the buying organization 2 ̆ 7 s point of view. Thus, the buying organization needs to define a buyer-centric directory from the external e-marketplaces. This is particularly important in desk-top purchasing systems that use the internalized <b>e-catalog.</b> Recently, the one-to-one <b>e-catalog</b> approach is attempted to allow the buyer to select a sub-directory from a seller 2 ̆ 7 s directory. Although this is a helpful screening capability, there are still several problems to be resolved such as the mismatched level of details, directory depths unbalance, and changed category names. In addition, the integration with multiple sellers 2 ̆ 7 e-catalogs and maintaining consistency with the dynamically changing sellers 2 ̆ 7 e-catalogs should be supported. To overcome these problems, we adopt the logic programming approach because it can represent the structures of both buyers 2 ̆ 7 and sellers 2 ̆ 7 directories. Predicates as directory definition language can effectively represent the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s extraction of relevant parts from sellers 2 ̆ 7 directories. The crudely selected directory can be modified using five directory modification rules. To control the application of these rules, we devised a top-down control algorithm. The algorithm could improve the depth and balance of the directory significantly, which will result in automatically generating more effective buyer 2 ̆ 7 s directory...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} part of data and content management in e-business scenarios deals with exchanging product-related data between business entities, and integrating them into target applications (e. g. ERP systems) or target documents (e. g. <b>e-catalogs)</b> at the recipient’s side. Content integration tasks can be much better automated if the textual descriptions are augmented by a machine-readable representation of the semantics. For this purpose, categorization standards for products and services, like UNSPSC, eClass, eOTD, or the Rosettanet Technical Dictionary (RNTD) are widely in use. Existing research, however, {{has focused on the}} architecture and structure of such standards, and did not investigate their actual content. In this paper, we present a framework of metrics for the quality and maturity of categorization standards, and apply these metrics to eClass, UNSPSC, eOTD, and RNTD. The results clearly show weaknesses which hamper the use in many application domains. Also, we can reveal that only some of these standards are actually maintained and updated, while others are rather inactive, dead collections. 1...|$|R
40|$|E-procurement {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing {{application}} areas for e-commerce. Though B 2 B transaction costs could be reduced recently by establishing XML based standards for electronic product catalogs and data interchange, B 2 B sales costs are still high due to the amount of human interaction. For the first time we present a fully automated electronic sales agent for e-procurement portals. The key technologies for this breakthrough are based on preferences modeled as strict partial orders, enabling a deep personalization of the B 2 B sales process. The interplay of several novel middleware components achieves to automate skills that so far could be executed only by a human vendor. As personalized search engine for XML based <b>e-catalogs</b> we use Preference XPath; the Preference Presenter implements a smart and sales psychology based presentation of search results, supporting various human sales strategies; the Preference Repository provides the management of situated long-term preferences; the flexible Personalized Price Offer and the multi-objective Preference Bargainer provide a personalized price determination and the opportunity to bargain about the price of an entire product bundle, applying up/cross and down selling techniques. Our prototype COSIMA B 2 B, supported by industrial partners, has been demonstrated already successfully at a large computer fair. 1...|$|R
40|$|A base of {{clearly defined}} product {{information}} {{is a key}} foundation for an e-commerce system. The manipulation and exchange of semantically enriched and precise product information can {{enhance the quality of}} an e-commerce system and offer a high level of inter-operability with other systems. Product information consists of product attributes and the relationships between products. Product cat-egorization (or classification) is one type of such relationships. Ontology can {{play an important role in}} the formalization of product information. Although the idea of utilizing ontology for <b>e-Catalogs</b> has been raised before, we are yet to find an operational implemen-tation of applying ontology in the domain. In this paper, we report on our recent effort to build an operational product ontology system for a government procurement service. The system is designed to serve as a product ontology knowledge base; not only for the design and construction of product databases but also for search and discovery of products. Especially, the keyword-based searching over product ontology database demands different techniques from those over conventional document databases or relational databases, and should be designed to reflect particular characteristics of product ontology. We also introduce some other issues that we have experienced in the project, and those issues include product ontology modeling, ontology construction and maintenance, and visualization. Our work pre-sented herein may serve as a reference model for similar projects in the future...|$|R
