5|$|After {{three months}} of {{inactivity}} and regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to begin fighting again. The target chosen for the first attack was {{the northern city of}} Ruhengeri, which lies immediately south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the best choice from a practical point of view, being the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful <b>family,</b> <b>came</b> from the north west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region was as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence, and Kagame hoped the attack would destabilise the government.|$|E

His father, Charles Edward Gordon Crawford, was a civil servant who had been educated at Marlborough College and Wadham College, Oxford before moving to India, where he became a High Court judge at Thane. The Crawford <b>family</b> <b>came</b> from Ayrshire in Scotland, and the child's great-uncle was the {{politician}} Robert Wigram Crawford. Crawford's mother, Alice Luscombe Mackenzie, {{was the daughter of}} a Scottish army doctor and his Devonshire wife. Alice died a few days after her son's birth, and so when he was three months old, Crawford was sent to England aboard the P liner Bokhara. During the journey he was entrusted to the care of his paternal aunt Eleanor, an Anglican nun who {{was the head of the}} Poona Convent of the Community of St Mary the Virgin.|$|E
5|$|The deepest rift in the Pankhurst <b>family</b> <b>came</b> in November 1913 when Sylvia {{spoke at}} a meeting of socialists and trade unionists in support of labour {{organiser}} Jim Larkin. She had been working with the East London Federation of Suffragettes (ELFS), a local branch of the WSPU which had a close relationship with socialists and organised labour. The close connection to labour groups and Sylvia's appearance on stage with Frederick Pethick-Lawrence – who also addressed the crowd – convinced Christabel that her sister was organising a group that might challenge the WSPU in the suffrage movement. The dispute became public, and members of groups including the WSPU, ILP, and ELFS braced themselves for a showdown.|$|E

5|$|The make-up for Citizen Kane {{was created}} and applied by Maurice Seiderman (1907–1989), a junior {{member of the}} RKO make-up department. Seiderman's <b>family</b> <b>came</b> to the United States from Russia in 1920, {{escaping}} persecution. As a child Seiderman had won a drawing competition and received an apprenticeship at the Moscow Art Theatre, where {{his father was a}} wigmaker and make-up artist. In New York his uncle was a theatrical scenic painter, and he helped Seiderman get into the union. He worked on Max Reinhardt's 1924 production of The Miracle and with the Yiddish Art Theatre, and he studied the human figure at the Art Students League of New York. After he moved to Los Angeles he was hired first by Max Factor and then by RKO. Seiderman had not been accepted into the union, which recognized him as only an apprentice, but RKO nevertheless used him to make up principal actors.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's {{family was}} from the area around Thierville near Le Bec-Hellouin, in the Risle River valley. The modern {{historian}} Frank Barlow speculates that Theobald {{may have been a}} distant relative of his successor as archbishop, Thomas Becket, as Becket's <b>family</b> <b>came</b> from the same part of Normandy. The exact date of Theobald's birth is unknown; the only clue to his age is that when he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man, suggesting a birth date of perhaps around 1090 to one modern historian. His father was supposedly a knight, but no contemporary reference gives his name. His brother Walter also became a priest, and later a bishop.|$|E
5|$|Unmentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, Royton {{does not}} appear in records until 1212, when it was {{documented}} to have been a thegnage estate, or manor, comprising twelve oxgangs of land, with an annual rate of 24shillings payable by the tenant, William Fitz William, to King John. From William, who died in 1223, Royton passed to his son Thomas, who was still alive in 1254. Thomas's daughter Margery, who married Alexander Luttrell of Somerset, sold the majority of Royton and its outlying land to John de Byron in around 1260. It is from this exchange that the Byron <b>family</b> <b>came</b> to use Royton as their chief place of residence until {{the early part of the}} 17th century.|$|E
