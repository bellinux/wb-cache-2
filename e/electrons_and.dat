5|$|Within {{the inner}} {{mitochondrial}} membrane, the lipid-soluble electron carrier coenzyme Q10 (Q) carries both <b>electrons</b> <b>and</b> protons by a redox cycle. This small benzoquinone molecule is very hydrophobic, so it diffuses freely within the membrane. When Q accepts two <b>electrons</b> <b>and</b> two protons, it becomes {{reduced to the}} ubiquinol form (QH2); when QH2 releases two <b>electrons</b> <b>and</b> two protons, it becomes oxidized back to the ubiquinone (Q) form. As a result, if two enzymes are arranged so that Q is reduced {{on one side of}} the membrane and QH2 oxidized on the other, ubiquinone will couple these reactions and shuttle protons across the membrane. Some bacterial electron transport chains use different quinones, such as menaquinone, in addition to ubiquinone.|$|E

The Ganymedian magnetosphere has a region of closed field lines located below 30° latitude, where charged particles (<b>electrons</b> <b>and</b> ions) are trapped, creating a kind of radiation belt. The main ion species in the magnetosphere is single ionized oxygen—O+—which fits well with Ganymede's tenuous oxygen atmosphere. In the polar cap regions, at latitudes higher than 30°, magnetic field lines are open, connecting Ganymede with Jupiter's ionosphere. In these areas, the energetic (tens and hundreds of kiloelectronvolt) <b>electrons</b> <b>and</b> ions have been detected, which may cause the auroras observed around the Ganymedian poles.

30|$|The <b>electron</b> <b>and</b> hole {{responsible}} for the I 2 emission can be localized at different NDs in the low-temperature regime <b>and</b> then the <b>electron</b> <b>and</b> hole pair is spatially separated. Therefore, the recombination probability decreases significantly (non-emissive). Increasing the temperature, the <b>electron</b> <b>and</b> hole are thermally excited to the free-like state (emitting I 2), and the recombination of the <b>electron</b> <b>and</b> hole can take place again. We find that the Elow 2 value indicating the activation (localization) energy of the I 2 emission at low temperatures agrees well with the energy difference between Eact 1 and Eact 2; Eact 1 (490 meV) − Eact 2 (410 meV) = 80 meV (Elow 2 = 90 meV). From this correspondence, we attribute the gradual increase in the I 2 emission at the low-temperature region to the thermal excitation of the carriers from the dark state, where the <b>electron</b> <b>and</b> hole are localized in different individual NDs, to the free-like state among neighboring NDs.|$|R

5|$|Although group 12 {{lies in the}} d-block of {{the modern}} 18-column {{periodic}} table, the d electrons of zinc, cadmium, and (almost always) mercury behave as core <b>electrons</b> <b>and</b> do not take part in bonding. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of the main-group elements, but is in stark contrast to that of the neighboring group 11 elements (copper, silver, and gold), which also have filled d-subshells in their ground-state electron configuration but behave chemically as transition metals. For example, the bonding in chromium(II) sulfide (CrS) involves mainly the 3d electrons; that in iron(II) sulfide (FeS) involves both the 3d and 4s electrons; but that of zinc sulfide (ZnS) involves only the 4s <b>electrons</b> <b>and</b> the 3d electrons behave as core electrons. Indeed, useful comparison can be made between their properties and the first two members of group 2, beryllium and magnesium, and in earlier short-form periodic table layouts, this relationship is illustrated more clearly. For instance, zinc and cadmium are similar to beryllium and magnesium in their atomic radii, ionic radii, electronegativities, and also in the structure of their binary compounds and their ability to form complex ions with many nitrogen and oxygen ligands, such as complex hydrides and amines. However, beryllium and magnesium are small atoms, unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals and like the group 12 elements (which have a greater nuclear charge but the same number of valence <b>electrons),</b> <b>and</b> the periodic trends down group 2 from beryllium to radium (similar to that of the alkali metals) are not as smooth when going down from beryllium to mercury (which is more similar to that of the p-block main groups) due to the d-block and lanthanide contractions. It is also the d-block and lanthanide contractions that give mercury many of its distinctive properties.|$|E
