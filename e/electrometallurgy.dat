50|$|Any {{extraction}} process {{will include a}} sequence of steps or unit processes for separating highly pure metals from undesirables in an economically efficient system. Unit processes are usually broken down into three categories: pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and <b>electrometallurgy.</b> In pyrometallurgy, the metal ore is first oxidized through roasting or smelting. The target metal is further refined at high temperatures and reduced to its pure form. In hydrometallurgy, the object metal is first dissociated from other materials using a chemical reaction, which is then extracted in pure form using electrolysis or precipitation. Finally, <b>electrometallurgy</b> generally involves electrolytic or electrothermal processing. The metal ore is either distilled in a electrolyte or acid solution, then magnetically deposited onto a cathode plate (electrowinning); or smelted then melted using an electric arc or plasma arc furnace (electrothermic reactor). Extractive metallurgy of ferrous and non-ferrous metals can involve pyrometallurgy, but chemical processes like hydrometallurgy and <b>electrometallurgy</b> are far more common in method of non-ferrous extraction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electrometallurgy</b> is {{the process}} of {{reduction}} of metals from metallic compounds to obtain the pure form of metal using electrolysis. aluminium, lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and in some cases copper, are produced in this way.|$|E

50|$|The {{field of}} ferrous and {{non-ferrous}} extractive metallurgy have specialties that are generically grouped into {{the categories of}} mineral processing, hydrometallurgy, pyrometallurgy, and <b>electrometallurgy</b> based on the process adopted to extract the metal. Several processes are used for extraction of same metal depending on occurrence and chemical requirements.|$|E
50|$|Ore {{concentrate}}, {{dressed ore}} or simply concentrate {{is the product}} generally produced by metal ore mines. The raw ore is usually ground finely in various comminution operations and gangue (waste) is removed, thus concentrating the metal component. The concentrate is then transported to various physical or chemical processes called hydrometallurgy, pyrometallurgy smelters, and <b>electrometallurgy</b> where {{it is used to}} produce useful metals.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrometallurgy is {{a method}} for obtaining metals from their ores. It is a {{technique}} {{within the field of}} extractive metallurgy involving the use of aqueous chemistry for the recovery of metals from ores, concentrates, and recycled or residual materials. [...] Metal chemical processing techniques that complement hydrometallurgy are pyrometallurgy, vapour metallurgy and molten salt <b>electrometallurgy.</b> Hydrometallurgy is typically divided into three general areas: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Electrometallurgy</b> {{involves}} metallurgical {{processes that}} take place in some form of electrolytic cell. The most common types of electrometallurgical processes are electrowinning and electro-refining. Electrowinning is an electrolysis process used to recover metals in aqueous solution, usually as the result of an ore having undergone one or more hydrometallurgical processes. The metal of interest is plated onto the cathode, while the anode is an inert electrical conductor. Electro-refining is used to dissolve an impure metallic anode (typically from a smelting process) and produce a high purity cathode. Fused salt electrolysis is another electrometallurgical process whereby the valuable metal has been dissolved into a molten salt which acts as the electrolyte, and the valuable metal collects on the cathode of the cell. The fused salt electrolysis process is conducted at temperatures sufficient to keep both the electrolyte and the metal being produced in the molten state. The scope of <b>electrometallurgy</b> has significant overlap with the areas of hydrometallurgy and (in the case of fused salt electrolysis) pyrometallurgy. Additionally, electrochemical phenomena play a considerable role in many mineral processing and hydrometallurgical processes.|$|E
