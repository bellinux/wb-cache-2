40|$|The {{advanced}} fine-coal cleaning {{techniques such}} as column flotation, recovers a low-ash ultra-fine size clean-coal product. However, economical dewatering of the clean coal product to less than 20 percent moisture using conventional technology is difficult. This research program objective is to evaluate a novel coal surface modification technique developed at the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research in conjunction with conventional and advanced dewatering technique at a pilot scale. The study which is in progress is being conducted at the Powell Mountain Coal Company`s Mayflower preparation plant located in St. Charles, VA. During this quarter laboratory dewatering studies were conducted using a 4 -in diameter laboratory chemical centrifuge. The baseline data provided a filter cake with about 32 % moisture. Addition of 0. 3 kg/t of a cationic surfactant lowered the moisture to 29 %. Addition of anionic and non-ionic surfactant was not effective in reducing the filter cake moisture content. In the pilot scale studies, a comparison was conducted between the high pressure and vacuum dewatering techniques. The base line data with high pressure and vacuum filtration provided filter cakes with 23. 6 % and 27. 8 % moisture, respectively. Addition of 20 g/t of cationic flocculent provided 21 % filter cake moisture using the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>filter.</b> A 15 % moisture filter cake was obtained using 1. 5 kg/t of non-ionic surfactant.

40|$|Liposomes are {{currently}} being investigated as potential parenterally used drug carriers. The main factor that influences the in vivo behavior of such liposomes is their vesicle size. A detailed and reliable knowledge of vesicle size is therefore {{necessary in order to}} interpret results of physical and biological investigations in a correct manner. It has earlier been discovered that it is feasible to determine the size distribution of vesicle dispersions in a reliable manner and it appears especially useful to employ the combination of SEC fractionation, PCS and the enzymatic PC quantitation. A drawback discovered was for certain liposome dispersions that in some of the dispersions SEC fractionation showed incomplete recovery of the vesicles. This indicated a demand for a different fractionation method which does not have the limitations that the SEC method described above has. To this end flow field-flow fractionation was chosen. In a previous study the influence of some key factors such as ionic strength of the eluent as well as pore size of the semi-permeable membrane on liposome fractionation behavior has been evaluated. Neutral liposomes were found very dependent of the ionic strength when it comes to elution time. In this study, the intention was {{to find out if the}} retention behavior and calculated geometric radius of liposomes obtained by flow field-flow fractionation in combination with multi-angle light scattering is affected by the osmotic pressure of the medium used for diluting the liposomes and/or running the AF 4. In order to exclude ionic-strength effects the salt concentration was kept constant while the osmotic pressure was varied by using mono- and disaccharides. In conclusion, this project has demonstrated that a change in osmotic pressure, with constant ionic strength, affects both elution time and calculated size of liposomes that were prepared by <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>filter</b> extrusion. But, osmotic stress was found to affect liposomes of different sizes in a different manner; liposomes that were smaller than the pore size of the filter used for extrusion were found to shrink in hyperosmotic medium but stay quite constant in size in hypo-osmotic medium. In contrast, liposomes that were larger than the pore size of the filter were found to shrink in hyperosmotic medium and swell in hypo-osmotic medium. A hypothesis is presented to explain this behavior...|$|E

40|$|Current {{models and}} test methods for {{determining}} filter efficiency ignore filter bypass, {{the air that}} circumvents filter media because of gaps around the filter or filter housing. In this paper, we develop a general model to estimate the size-resolved particle removal efficiency, including bypass, of HVAC filters. The model applies the measured pressure drop of the filter to determine the airflow through the bypass cracks and accounts for particle loss in the bypass cracks. We consider a particle size range of 0. 01 to 10 µm, nine typical commercial and residential filters in clean and dust-loaded configurations, and {{a wide range of}} bypass gaps typical of those found in real filter installations. The model suggests that gaps on the order of 1 mm around well-seated filters have little effect on the performance of most <b>filters.</b> For <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> drop <b>filters,</b> small gaps decrease filter performance and large gaps substantially decrease filter performance.

In order to remove these pollutants from drinking water, the EPA recommends that unconventional methods such as Activated carbon filtering or high-pressure membrane filtering must be used, demonstrating the extra precautions residents must take.

40|$|Deep-sea life is {{featured}} by extreme environmental conditions, such as low temperature, limitation in nutrients and carbon sources, and <b>high</b> hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> (Jannasch, 1979). As a consequence, marine microbial communities have incredibly broadened their metabolic versatility to make {{efficient use of}} any resource available (Sibuet and Karine, 1998). In the present work, we collected deep-sea microbial communities (1 km, equivalent to 100 bars) and grew them using long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons. Because of their solid nature at ambient temperature and pressure, such hydrocarbons have a higher chance to sink to the seafloor during spills with respect to gaseous or liquid, short-chained ones. Hence, our hypothesis was {{that the use of}} long-chain alkanes as unique carbon sources at <b>high</b> hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> would have resulted into microbial communities enriched in piezophiles, i. e., bacteria growing better at <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> rather than at atmospheric ones. Nevertheless, <b>high</b> hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> does not improve much the solubility of these compounds in water (Brunner, 1990), the bioavailability of which remains always extremely low. This condition is ideal to test the flexibility of piezophiles and address some of the basic questions regarding their metabolism. In particular, in these bacteria any biomolecule (enzymes, lipids, nucleic acids, etc.) must be adapted to properly function under <b>high</b> <b>pressure.</b> Hence, the range of reaction conditions suitable for biocatalysis in these microbes is supposed to be larger than for bacteria growing in surface waters. Deep-sea samples (1 km, 100 bars) were incubated at three different pressure conditions (1, 100 and 200 bars) using either icosane (C 20) or triacontane (C 30). In particular, these three pressure conditions were selected in order to separately enrich piezotolerant bacteria (growing well at both 1 and 100 bars) from piezophiles (growing better at 100 and 200 bars). High-pressure reactors were inoculated with the same initial environmental microbial community and run for 9 consecutive incubation periods, each of which lasted 10 d. At the end of any incubation, aliquots of growing bacterial cells were transferred to a new reactor, for a total of 90 d of enrichment. Experiments were followed according to pH, O 2 consumption, optical density, phosphates and sulphates consumption, hydrophobicity, cell number by flow cytometry and hydrocarbon solubility in the water phase. Furthermore, characterization of the microbial community shift was conducted through both DGGE and high throughput sequencing using Illumina platform. In each culture condition, marine bacteria were able to grow by taking up C 20 and C 30. Respiration rates were always high, and production of surfactants occurred particularly at 1 bar. This is probably {{due to the fact that}} a higher number of cells was noted at 1 bar than at <b>higher</b> <b>pressures,</b> when <b>filtering</b> with 25 μm. However, numerous bacterial populations smaller than 1. 5 μm were noted in all conditions. Hydrophobicity, i. e., the capability to move towards oil droplets, was generally high in all conditions. Phosphates and sulphates consumption was statistically different according to the pressure applied and/or O 2 availability.
