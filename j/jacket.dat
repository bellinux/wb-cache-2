5|$|The <b>jacket</b> {{prescribed}} for infantry use {{was of the}} same design for all service men. The design itself depended entirely on the region, time, {{and the source of}} fabrics. The Eastern Theater uniform <b>jacket</b> was the Richmond Depot design, with three primary types issued throughout the war. The <b>jacket</b> varied from a cadet gray, piped and trimmed <b>jacket,</b> looking much like a pre-war militia <b>jacket,</b> to the jeans-cloth <b>jacket</b> that was worn out in six months. The materials and uniforms imported from England were also issued to the troops through this facility. The Western and Deep Southern facilities manufactured similar uniforms, being jeans-cloth, dyed with vegetable based grays, that would fade to brown or tan. The typical jackets issued had 5-7 button fronts, with collar and cuff trim that varied from era, region and source, and an outside pocket on occasion.|$|E
5|$|By tradition, {{the winner}} of the {{previous}} year's Masters Tournament puts the <b>jacket</b> on the current winner {{at the end of the}} tournament. In 1966, Jack Nicklaus became the first player to win in consecutive years and he donned the <b>jacket</b> himself. When Nick Faldo (in 1990) and Tiger Woods (in 2002) repeated as champions, the chairman of Augusta National put the <b>jacket</b> on them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effectiveness}} of four different carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) hybridized methods to retrofit the high strength concrete columns with shear capacity deficiency {{for improving the}} shear behavior is described in this paper. These retrofitting methods include the wrapped <b>jacketing,</b> the L-shaped <b>jacketing</b> combined with wrapped <b>jacketing,</b> the clamp plates plus wrapped <b>jacketing</b> and the L-shaped <b>jacketing,</b> clamp plates and wrapped <b>jacketing.</b> Five specimens were tested under low reversed cyclic loading. The influence of retrofitting on the failure mode, ductility, strength, stiffness degradation, and distribution of CFRP strain is analyzed. The {{results indicate that the}} retrofitted specimens exhibit high levels of ductility superior to the reference specimen. Among the four retrofitting methods, the {{effectiveness of}} method of only the wrapped <b>jacketing</b> is the worst, the method of the clamp plates plus wrapped <b>jacketing</b> has better performance compared to the method of the L-shaped <b>jacketing</b> combined with wrapped <b>jacketing,</b> and the method of the L-shaped <b>jacketing,</b> clamp plates and wrapped <b>jacketing</b> performs best...|$|R

5|$|In 1979, McNair's {{idea for}} a Yellow <b>Jacket</b> was reintroduced by another Georgia Tech student, Richie Bland. Bland, who was {{apparently}} unaware of McNair's prior initiative, paid $1,400 to have a local theme park costume designer make a yellow <b>jacket</b> costume that he first wore at a pep rally prior to the Tennessee football game. Rather than obtain permission from Georgia Tech as Judi had done in 1972, this student, {{a few weeks later}} simply sneaked onto the field in costume during a football game and ran across the field. The fans naturally believed that this costumed character was acting as an official member of the cheerleading squad and responded accordingly. By 1980 this new incarnation of the yellow <b>jacket</b> mascot was given the name Buzz Bee and was adopted as an official mascot by Georgia Tech. This new Buzz character would be the model for a new Georgia Tech emblem, designed in 1985 by Mike Lester.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to a cash prize, {{the winner of the}} tournament is presented with a distinctive green <b>jacket,</b> formally awarded since 1949, and informally acquired by the champions for many years before that. The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green <b>jacket</b> has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon {{after the end of the}} tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the spectators. Winners keep their <b>jacket</b> for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.|$|E

50|$|In 1922, the Western Cartridge Company {{introduced}} a copper-washed bullet <b>jacketing</b> called Lubaloy {{which stands for}} lubricating alloy. Lubaloy replaced standard bullet <b>jacketing</b> which had been cupro-nickel coated steel or solid cupro-nickel. The original <b>jacketing</b> {{was found to be}} detrimental to firearm performance over time. Lumps of the hot <b>jacketing</b> were deposited {{near the end of the}} barrel during firing, eventually creating a hazard or destroying the barrel. The Lubaloy-Palma ammunition <b>jacketing</b> was a breakthrough solution to this persistent dilemma. It was composed of 90% copper, 8% zinc, and 2% tin.|$|R

5|$|The Glan-y-wern Canal {{was built}} to connect Richard Jenkins' {{colliery}} at Glan-y-wern with the River Neath at Trowman's Hole, an inlet across the mud flats from the main channel of the river Neath, which was later known as Red <b>Jacket</b> Pill. Jenkins obtained a lease to build it from Lord Vernon on 14 August 1788, but died on the same day. Edward Elton took over management of the colliery, and the canal was constructed by 1790, {{although there was no}} actual connection to the river. At Red <b>Jacket,</b> cargos were transhipped from the small boats used on the canal to larger vessels in the pill, which was tidal. The canal remained in use for about 20 years. Elton became bankrupt and died in 1810 after which Lord Vernon, who had leased the land on which the canal {{was built to}} Elton, placed a distraint on the wharves at Red <b>Jacket</b> and on the barges and it became disused.|$|E
