5|$|Sea anemones {{and their}} {{attendant}} anemone fish can make attractive aquarium exhibits {{and both are}} often harvested <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> as adults or juveniles. These fishing activities significantly impact the populations of anemones and anemone fish by drastically reducing the densities of each in exploited areas. Besides their collection <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> for use in reef aquaria, sea anemones are also threatened by alterations to their environment. Those living in shallow water coastal locations are affected directly by pollution and siltation, and indirectly by the effect these have on their photosynthetic symbionts and the prey on which they feed.|$|E

The tradition is not new: since 1844, the British monarchy has presented an unbroken series of Kashmir goats to the Royal Welch Fusiliers from the Crown's own royal herd.|$|E
5|$|By 7,000 BC, sowing and {{harvesting}} reached the fertile soil of Mesopotamia, where Sumerians systematized it and scaled it up. By 8,000 BC, farming was entrenched {{on the banks}} of the River Nile. About this time, agriculture was developed independently in the Far East, probably in China, with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop. Maize was domesticated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> grass teosinte in West Mexico by 6,700 BC.|$|E

5|$|Cabbage was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than Near Eastern {{crops such as}} lentils and summer wheat. Because of {{the wide range of}} crops developed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> B.oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts of central and western Europe.|$|E

While America never lacked for real trees, the time and expense of retrieving them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> was significant. Early in the twentieth century, however, Christmas tree farms began supplying large metropolitan areas with real trees. In the 1920s, real trees became commonplace, supplanting artificial trees in American homes.|$|E

5|$|The {{painted turtle}} is {{sometimes}} eaten {{but is not}} highly regarded as food, as even the largest subspecies, the western painted turtle, is inconveniently small and larger turtles are available.

In the Midwest, turtle racing is popular at summer fairs.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{threats to}} red pandas are direct harvest <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild,</b> live or dead, {{competition}} with domestic livestock resulting in habitat degradation, and deforestation resulting in habitat loss or fragmentation.

5000|$|As Rick Moody writes, Daniele's {{approach}} {{seems to}} come more <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilds</b> of literature, and particularly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilds</b> of European philosophy, than from any rigorous background in music. Both the two released records are, in fact, loaded with literature references, as {{a quick look at}} the booklets points out. They both include [...] "theoretical line texts" [...] which look like essays or manifestos; on one hand these essays explain the foundation of Daniele's musical activity, coming mostly from contemporary philosophy, in particular <b>from</b> <b>the</b> French philosophy by Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes and the theoretic-linguistic vision by Pier Paolo Pasolini; on the other hand, as Dionisio Capuano remarks, [...] "her theoretic will can hamper the total fruition".|$|R

5|$|Agriculture began {{independently}} {{in different}} parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Some of the earliest known domestications were of animals. Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 11,000 BC. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 11,000 and 9,000 BC. Cattle were domesticated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC. Camels were domesticated late, perhaps around 3,000 BC.|$|E
5|$|Alligators and {{crocodiles}} {{were first}} farmed {{in the early}} 20th century, but the facilities involved were zoo-like and their main source of income was from tourism. By the early 1960s, the feasibility of farming these reptiles on a commercial scale was investigated {{in response to the}} decline of many crocodilian species around the world. Farming involves breeding and rearing captive stock on a self-contained basis, whereas ranching means the use of eggs, juveniles, or adults taken each year <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild.</b> Commercial organisations must satisfy the criteria of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) by demonstrating that, in the area concerned, they do not adversely impact the wild population.|$|E

5|$|Bees {{have been}} kept in hives {{since at least the}} First Dynasty of Egypt, five {{thousand}} years ago, and man had been harvesting honey <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> long before that. Fixed comb hives are used {{in many parts of the}} world and are made from any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which enable the combs to be removed for processing and extraction of honey. Quite apart from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage (Brassica oleracea or B.oleracea var. capitata, var. tuba, var. sabauda or var. acephala) is {{a member}} of the genus Brassica and the mustard family, Brassicaceae. Several other cruciferous {{vegetables}} (sometimes known as cole crops) are considered cultivars of B.oleracea, including broccoli, collard greens, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and sprouting broccoli. All of these developed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> cabbage B.oleracea var. oleracea, also called colewort or field cabbage. This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today, as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics, such as large heads for cabbage, large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli.|$|E
5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} the time they were first brought from the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild,</b> in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E
