Fluid-structure interaction is profoundly affected, and the well-known modes of vortex shedding observed with a linear elastic system are modified or absent. There is no evidence of lock-in, and the dominant impact frequency corresponds to a constant Strouhal number of 0. 18. The presence of an <b>endstop</b> {{on one side of the}} motion can lead to large increases in displacements in the opposite direction.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} titled The {{influence}} of a nonlinear Power Take Off on a Wave Energy Converter. It looks at the effect that having a nonlinear Power Take Off (PTO) has on an inertial referenced, slack moored, point absorber, Wave Energy Converter (WEC). The generic device studied utilizes relative heave motion between an axi-symmetric cylinder and an internal mass, for the PTO to operate between. The PTO {{is the part of}} the WEC that transforms the relative motion into electricity. In this work, three different types of nonlinear PTO and a linear PTO are presented, tested, analysed and compared. The three nonlinear PTO types are: • A PTO that extracts energy in only one direction, either in relative compression or expansion. • A linear PTO and an additional <b>endstop</b> or peripheral PTO, that can only extract energy when the relative position of the internal mass has reached a pre-determined position. • A PTO that has damping forces that are quadratically proportional to the relative velocity. A numerical simulation has been built based upon a Runge-Kutta time series progression. The model uses the summation of the excitation force from the waves, the radiation force from the movement of the cylinder, the buoyancy force and the PTO forces. These combine to cause acceleration of the mass of the external cylinder, with an equal and opposite PTO force acting on the internal mass. The excitation force and added mass values are obtained from the boundary element method software, WAMIT. Prony’s method is used to obtain an approximate radiation force, based upon the radiation time force history. This numerical model operates on both a 1 : 40 scale and a full sized model. The numerical model finds the optimal PTO parameters, for different PTO setups, in irregular sea states. This optimum is based on the power extracted as well as indications of the reliability and lifetime of the system. The numerical simulation presents results showing how the nonlinearity of the PTO influences the motions of the WEC, resulting in dissimilarities between the Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) results, obtained from regular seas, and the Linear Transfer Function (LTF), found from irregular sea testing. The experimental model has been tested in the Curved Wave Tank facility at the University of Edinburgh, with a 1 : 40 scaled model. It used a central rod both as a support structure and to limit the movement of the cylinder and internal mass to heave. Between the cylinder and internal mass a spring and pneumatic damper operate in parallel, in various setups. It was tested in regular and irregular sea states and the position of the internal mass and cylinder was monitored. The experimental model was tested to ascertain the time series motions, RAO, LTF, the relative phase between the bodies and the power extracted for different wave climates. The numerical and experimental work were compared to allow confidence in both models. They showed relatively good agreement for the RAOs, LTFs and predictions of the relative phase but there was discrepancies in the predicted power for both regular and irregular seas. This difference is due to the difficulties in obtaining the relative velocities in the experimental model, resulting in a significant error in power prediction, since the power is proportional to the square of the relative velocities. The conclusions show that having a mono-directional PTO as opposed to a bi-directional PTO results in an approximately equal or greater power extraction in a variety of different sea states. An additional <b>endstop</b> or peripheral damper can increase the total power that a WEC extracts, in some situations, and may be advantageous depending upon the other potential benefits it brings to the WEC.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the development of}} a Numerical Wave Tank (NWT) capable of describing the coupled behaviour of Wave Energy Converters (WECs) and their moorings under extreme wave loading. The NWT utilises the open-source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software OpenFOAM(R) to solve the fully nonlinear, incompressible, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations for air and water using the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and a Volume of Fluid (VOF) treatment of the interface. A method for numerically generating extreme waves is devised, based on the dispersively-focused NewWave theory and using the additional toolbox waves 2 Foam. A parametric study of the required mesh resolution shows that steeper waves require finer grids for mesh independence. Surface elevation results for wave-only cases closely match those from experiments, although an improved definition of the flow properties is required to generate very steep focused waves. Predictions of extreme wave run-up and pressure on the front of a fixed truncated cylinder compare well with physical measurements; the numerical solution successfully predicts the secondary loading cycle associated with the nonlinear ringing effect and shows a nonlinear relationship between incident crest height and horizontal load. With near perfect agreement during an extreme wave event, the reproduction of the six degree of freedom (6 DOF) motion and load in the linearly-elastic mooring of a hemispherical-bottomed buoy significantly improves on similar studies from the literature. Uniquely, this study compares simulations of two existing WEC designs with scale-model tank tests. For the Wavestar machine, a point-absorber constrained to pitch motion only, results show good agreement with physical measurements of pressure, force and float motion in regular waves, although the solution in the wake region requires improvement. Adding bespoke functionality, a point-absorber designed by Seabased AB, consisting of a moored float and Power Take-Off (PTO) with limited stroke length, translator and <b>endstop,</b> is modelled in large regular waves. This represents a level of complexity not previously attempted in CFD and the 6 DOF float motion and load in the mooring compare well with experiments. In conclusion, the computational tool developed here is capable of reliably predicting the behaviour of WEC systems during extreme wave events and, with some additional parameterisation, could be used to assess the survivability of WEC systems at full-scale before going to the expense of deployment at sea.

40|$|Difference {{operations}} are ubiquitous {{in the visual}} cortex. The central hypothesis in this thesis is that a nonlinear difference model can account for the functional properties of three different classes of visual cortical neurons. Abstractly each of the different neurons can {{be understood in terms}} of the same difference model although the computations they perform can be entirely different. <b>Endstopped</b> neurons respond to short or highly curved oriented patterns. Their behaviour results from the difference in activation of their classical receptive field and inhibitory endzones. Two models of <b>endstopped</b> neurons are evaluated mathematically and by computer simulation. It is concluded that a model with displaced complex cell-like endzones is both more computationally robust and more consistent with the physiological evidence. Other visual cortical neurons have inhibitory zones which are displaced normally rather than tangentially with respect to the neuron's receptive field orientation. These sidestopped cells are selective for narrow patterns. In other visual cortical neurons the side inhibition is derived from a different eye than the classical receptive field. Because of the geometry of projection these are referred to as binocular Near and Far cells. A difference model of sidestopped and Near and Far neurons is developed which captures their principal features. Neurons in visual cortical area MT of primates have been shown to exhibit a velocity-specific antagonism between the receptive field and a surrounding region. It is argued that center-surround antagonism is an attempt to resolve competing constraints. Signal reliability increases with spatial averaging, but the variation of the flow field invariably increases with area. A unifying perspective is that difference models provide a means of estimating the range over which a visual quantity is constant or linear. Varieties of these models exist with a more refined property [...] selectivity for sign of contour curvature or, under certain circumstances, the sign of convexity of the surface generating a binocular disparity or motion field...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPeriodic grating {{patterns}} {{were created by}} phase shifting or eliminating vertical columns of a fine line carrier grating oriented 45 deg. Motion was created by translating the patterns parallel to the carrier grating.

In the complementary conditions an illusory contour-motion was seen perpendicular to {{the orientation of the}} terminator-defined contours. A model involving a competition between second-layer filters (encoding the orientation and motions of the terminator defined contours) and double <b>endstopped</b> mechanisms (signalling the presence of terminators) was developed and found to be in quantitative agreement with these data. Experiments with plaids composed of two such {{patterns were}} generally consistent with the results of the one-dimensional cases.

This approach is successful at producing realistic tuning for stimulus length and curvature without the problems of false responses or critical dependencies on stimulus position that other researchers have experienced. The simulated interactions also give rise to saliency effects, such as an enhancement of the cortical response to a texture element differing in orientation from its surrounding texture. Additionally, the population orientation estimate given {{in response to a}} single pattern element is biased by the presence of suitably oriented surround elements.

The model is a functional but dichotomous one, because keypoints are employed to model the “where” data stream, with dynamic routing of features from V 1 to higher areas to obtain translation, rotation and size invariance, whereas lines and edges are employed in the “what” stream for object categorization and recognition. Furthermore, both the “where” and “what” pathways are dynamic in that information at coarse scales is employed first, after which information at progressively finer scales is added in order to refine the processes, i. e., both the dynamic feature routing and the categorization level.

40|$|That {{shape is}} {{important}} for perception {{has been known for}} almost a thousand years (thanks to Alhazen in 1083) and has been a subject of study ever since by scientists and phylosophers (such as Descartes, Helmholtz or the Gestalt psychologists). Shapes are important object descriptors. If there was any remote doubt regarding the importance of shape, recent experiments have shown that intermediate areas of primate visual cortex such as V 2, V 4 and TEO are involved in analyzing shape features such as corners and curvatures. The primate brain appears to perform a wide variety of complex tasks by means of simple operations. These operations are applied across several layers of neurons, representing increasingly complex, abstract intermediate processing stages. Recently, new models have attempted to emulate the human visual system. However, the role of intermediate representations in the visual cortex and their importance have not been adequately studied in computational modeling. This paper proposes a model of shape-selective neurons whose shape-selectivity is achieved through intermediate layers of visual representation not previously fully explored.

40|$|A {{neural network}} model of global motion {{segmentation}} by visual cortex is described. Called the Motion Boundary Contour System (BCS), the model clarifies how ambiguous local movements on a complex moving shape are actively reorganized into a coherent global motion signal. Unlike many previous researchers, we analyse how a coherent motion signal is imparted to all regions of a moving figure, not only to regions at which unambiguous motion signals exist. The model hereby suggests {{a solution to the}} global aperture problem. The Motion BCS describes how preprocessing of motion signals by a Motion Oriented Contrast Filter (MOC Filter) is joined to long-range cooperative grouping mechanisms in a Motion Cooperative-Competitive Loop (MOCC Loop) to control phenomena such as motion capture. The Motion BCS is computed in parallel with the Static BCS of Grossberg and Mingolla (1985 a, 1985 b, 1987). Homologous properties of the Motion BCS and the Static BCS, specialized to process movement directions and static orientations, respectively, support a unified explanation of many data about static form perception and motion form perception that have heretofore been unexplained or treated separately.

40|$|A {{neural network}} model is {{developed}} to explain how visual thalamocortical interactions give rise to boundary percepts such as illusory contours and surface percepts such as filled-in brightnesses. Top-down feedback interactions are needed in addition to bottom-up feed-forward interactions to simulate these data. One feedback loop is modeled between lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and cortical area V 1, and another within cortical areas V 1 and V 2. The first feedback loop realizes a matching process which enhances LGN cell activities {{that are consistent with}} those of active cortical cells, and suppresses LGN activities that are not. This corticogeniculate feedback, being <b>endstopped</b> and oriented, also enhances LGN ON cell activations at the ends of thin dark lines, thereby leading to enhanced cortical brightness percepts when the lines group into closed illusory contours. The second feedback loop generates boundary representations, including illusory contours, that coherently bind distributed cortical features together. Brightness percepts form within the surface representations through a diffusive filling-in process that is contained by resistive gating signals from the boundary representations. The model is used to simulate illusory contours and surface brightnesses induced by Ehrenstein disks, Kanizsa squares, Glass patterns, and cafe wall patterns in single contrast, reverse contrast, and mixed contrast configurations. These examples illustrate how boundary and surface mechanisms can generate percepts that are highly context-sensitive, induding how illusory contours can be amodally recognized without being seen, how model simple cells in V 1 respond preferentially to luminance discontinuities using inputs from both LGN ON and OFF cells, how model bipole cells in V 2 with two colinear receptive fields can help to complete curved illusory contours, how short-range simple cell groupings and long-range bipole cell groupings can sometimes generate different outcomes, and how model double opponent, filling-in and boundary segmentation mechanisms in V 4 interact to generate surface brightness percepts in which filling-in of enhanced brightness and darkness can occur before the net brightness distribution is computed by double opponent interactions...|$|R

In the input layer V 1 of the visual cortex there are simple, complex and <b>endstopped</b> cells. These provide a multi-scale representation of objects and scene in terms of lines, edges and keypoints. In this thesis we combine recent progress concerning the development of computational models of these and other cells with processes in higher cortical areas V 2 and V 4 etc. Three pertinent challenges are discussed: (i) object recognition embedded in a cortical architecture; (ii) brightness perception, and (iii) painterly rendering based on human vision. Specific aspects are Focusof- Attention by means of keypoint-based saliency maps, the dynamic routing of features from V 1 through higher cortical areas in order to obtain translation, rotation and size invariance, and the construction of normalized object templates with canonical views in visual memory. Our simulations show that the multi-scale representations can be integrated into a cortical architecture in order to model subsequent processing steps: from segregation, via different categorization levels, until final object recognition is obtained. As for real cortical processing, the system starts with coarse-scale information, refines categorization by using mediumscale information, and employs all scales in recognition. We also show that a 2 D brightness model can be based on the multi-scale symbolic representation of lines and edges, with an additional low-pass channel and nonlinear amplitude transfer functions, such that object recognition and brightness perception are combined processes based on the same information. The brightness model can predict many different effects such as Mach bands, grating induction, the Craik-O’Brien-Cornsweet illusion and brightness induction, i. e. the opposite effects of assimilation (White effect) and simultaneous brightness contrast. Finally, a novel application is introduced: painterly rendering has been linked to computer vision, but we propose to link it to human vision because perception and painting are two processes which are strongly interwoven...|$|R

Here the partially occluded fragments of motion signals available to an observer must be coherently grouped into {{the motion of}} a single object. A 3 D FORMOTION model comprises five important functional interactions involving the brain’s form and motion systems that address such situations. Because the model’s stages are analogous to areas of the primate visual system, we refer to the stages by corresponding anatomical names. In one of these functional interactions, 3 D boundary representations, in which figures are separated from their backgrounds, are formed in cortical area V 2. These depth-selective V 2 boundaries select motion signals at the appropriate depths in MT via V 2 -to-MT signals. In another, motion signals in MT disambiguate locally incomplete or ambiguous boundary signals in V 2 via MT-to-V 1 -to-V 2 feedback. The third functional property concerns resolution of the aperture problem along straight moving contours by propagating the influence of unambiguous motion signals generated at contour terminators or corners. Here, sparse “feature tracking signals” from, e. g., line ends, are amplified to overwhelm numerically superior ambiguous motion signals along line segment interiors. In the fourth, a spatially anisotropic motion grouping process takes place across perceptual space via MT-MST feedback to integrate veridical feature-tracking and ambiguous motion signals to determine a global object motion percept. The fifth property uses the MT-MST feedback loop to convey an attentional priming signal from higher brain areas back to V 1 and V 2. The model's use of mechanisms such as divisive normalization, <b>endstopping,</b> cross-orientation inhibition, and longrange cooperation is described. Simulated data include: the degree of motion coherence of rotating shapes observed through apertures, the coherent vs. element motion percepts separated in depth during the chopsticks illusion, and the rigid vs. non-rigid appearance of rotating ellipses.

40|$|A {{neural network}} model of {{boundary}} segmentation and surface representation is devdoped to process images containing range data gathered by a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor. The boundary and surface processing are accomplished by an improved Boundary Contom System (BCS) and Feature Contour Systmn (FCS), respecitively, that have been derived from analyses of perceptual and nenrobiological data. BCS/FCS processing make's structures such as motor vehicles, roads, and buildings more salient and interpretable to hnman observers {{than they are in}} the original imagery. Early processing by ON cells and OFF cells embedded in shunting center surround network models preprocessing by lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Such preprocessing compensates for illumination gradients, normalizes input dynamic range, and extracts local ratio contrasts. ON and and OFF cell outputs are combined in the BCS to defim; oriented filters that model cortical simple cells. Pooling ON and OFF outputs at simple cells overcomes complementary processing deficiencies of each cell type along concave and convex contours, and enhances simple cell sensitivity to image edges. Oriented filter outputs are rectified and outputs sensitive to opposite contrast polarities are pooled to define complex cells. The complex cells output to stages of short range spatial competition (or <b>endstopping)</b> and orienta. tiona. l competition arnong hypercomplex cells. Hypercomplex cells activate long range cooperative bipole cells that begin to group image boundaries. Nonlinear feedback between bipole cells and hypercomplex cells segments image regions by cooperatively completing and regularizing the most favored boundaries while suppressing image noise and weaker boundary groupings. Boundary segnmentation is perfornwcl by three copies of the BCS at smalL medium, and large filter scales. whose subsequent interaction distances covary with the size of the filter. Filling-in of multiple surface: representations occurs within the FCS at each scale via a boundary-gated diffusion process. Diffusion is activated by the normalized LGN ON and OFF outputs within ON and OFF filling-in domains. Diffusion is restricted to the regions defined by getting signals from the corresponding BCS boundary segmentation. The filled-in opponent ON and OFF signals are subtracted to form double opponent surface representations. These surface representations are shown by any of three methods to be sensitive to both image ratio contrasts and background luminance. The three scales of surface representation are then added to yield a final multiple-scale output. The BCS and FCS are shown to perform favorably in comparison to several other techniques for speckle removal.
