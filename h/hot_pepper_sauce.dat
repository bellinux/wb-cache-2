50|$|Unlike other North African cuisine, Tunisian food {{is quite}} spicy. A popular {{condiment}} and ingredient {{which is used}} extensively Tunisian cooking, harissa is a <b>hot</b> red <b>pepper</b> <b>sauce</b> made of red chili peppers and garlic, flavoured with coriander, cumin, olive oil and often tomatoes. There is an old wive's tale that says a husband can judge his wife's affections {{by the amount of}} <b>hot</b> <b>peppers</b> she uses when preparing his food. If the food becomes bland then a man may believe that his wife no longer loves him. However, when the food is prepared for guests the <b>hot</b> <b>peppers</b> are often toned down to suit the possibly more delicate palate of the visitor. Like harissa or chili peppers, the tomato is also an ingredient which cannot be separated from the cuisine of Tunisia. Tuna, eggs, olives and various varieties of pasta, cereals, herbs and spices are also ingredients which are featured prominently in Tunisian cooking.|$|R
40|$|A {{sensitive}} electroanalytical {{methodology for}} {{the determination of}} capsaicin using adsorptive stripping voltammetry (AdsSV) at a multiwalled carbon nanotube modified basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrode (MWCNT-BPPGE) is presented. This analytical method is then further developed using a multiwalled carbon nanotube screen-printed electrode (MWCNT-SPE) demonstrating the proof-of-concept that this approach can easily be incorporated into a sensing device which is both facile to use and inexpensive to produce. Capsaicin is the chemical responsible for the hot taste of chilli peppers, and measuring the concentration of capsaicin is an indicator of how hot any given chilli <b>pepper,</b> <b>hot</b> <b>sauce</b> and other related foodstuffs are. Standard additions plots for AdsSV of capsaicin at open circuit potential at a MWCNT-BPPGE exhibits two linear ranges, from 0. 5 to 15 µM and from 15 to 60 µM. Using the first range of calibration curve, a detection limit of 0. 31 µM (based on 3 s) is obtained. The plot of standard additions of capsaicin determined using the disposable MWCNT-SPE shows a linear range between 0. 5 and 35 µM and a detection limit of 0. 45 µM. MWCNT-BPPGE and MWCNT-SPE are successfully utilized for the determination of capsaicin in real samples, such as a few commercially available <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> <b>sauces,</b> and the determined values are in excellent agreement and correlation with the average Scoville unit values {{reported in the literature}} for these sauces. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first electroanalytical method using MWCNT-BPPGE or MWCNT-SPE reported for the determination of capsaicin. This method offers advantages such as precision and objectivity over the well-known but potentially subjective Scoville method (based on organoleptic testing by human tasting panels) and is facile and inexpensive compared to existing HPLC methods...|$|R

40|$|Product {{differentiation}} {{is pervasive}} in markets. It {{is at the}} heart of structural empiricism and it smoothes jagged behavior that causes paradoxical outcomes in several theoretical models. Firms differentiate their products to avoid ruinous price competition. Representative consumer, discrete choice, and location models are not necessarily inconsistent, but performance depends crucially on the degree of localization of competition. With (symmetric) global competition, rents are typically small and market variety near optimal. With local competition, profits may be protected because entrants must find profitable niches. These rents lead firms to competitively dissipative them, and performance may be poor. 1. Overview Consumer goods are available in a variety of styles and brands. Product differentiation refers to such variations within a product class that (some) consumers view as imperfect substitutes.
