Militarily, the bombing operation couldn't prevent North Vietnam from continuing its war against the South because until March 1972, that was a guerrilla war which was not vulnerable to air attack and required few <b>external</b> <b>supplies,</b> thus negating efforts at air interdiction.

50|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars, the {{scarcity}} of <b>external</b> <b>supplies</b> of minerals to the United Kingdom lead to a boom in the kelp industry, which became North Uist's main source of income. When the war ended, the sudden re-availability of foreign mineral supplies lead to an abrupt collapse in the demand for kelp-based products. The burning of kelp had also damaged the fertility of the land. As a result, the crofters of North Uist {{could no longer afford}} the rents; even though the landlords reduced the rents (e.g. in 1827 the rents were reduced by 20%) many crofters resorted to emigration.|$|E

5000|$|Weight - Some AC {{adapters}} can be heavy, exerting {{excess weight}} on the power socket (this depends on the socket design {{of the country in}} question). Some external power supplies are [...] "power bricks" [...] (also known as [...] "line lumps") having a short AC cord so they can lie on the floor, thus relieving strain, at the expense of clutter. Other wall-hanging types are made long and thin, minimizing the leverage of their weight vector that pulls the plug out, but exacerbating the size problem. The weight for equipment that must be carried (e.g. for traveling) is not a disadvantage of <b>external</b> <b>supplies,</b> as the alternative is an equally heavy internal supply; but in many cases a single universal supply could replace several proprietary ones.|$|E

30|$|One of the {{fundamental}} reasons for the prevalence of non-equilibrium conditions {{is considered to be}} related to the deficiency of water during the retrograde stage. Firstly, rehydration reactions generally require an <b>external</b> <b>supply</b> of water or breakdown of hydrous minerals sufficient to produce low-temperature hydrous minerals (e.g., Yardley et al. 2014; Vitale Brovarone and Beyssac 2014; Palin et al. 2014). Secondly, rehydration reactions are generally volume expanding, which slows down the <b>external</b> <b>supply</b> of water by closing preexisting fluid pathways, if external stress is absent (e.g., Okamoto and Shimizu 2015). Thirdly, the rates of reaction processes (e.g., intra-/intergrain diffusion, nucleation, and surface processes) are hindered by the deficiency of metamorphic fluids as well as being strongly controlled by temperature (e.g., Rubie 1986; Austrheim 1987).|$|R

The way between the Russian borderland (Machtovyi Island of the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago, 80°15N, 097°27E) and the Canadian coast (83°08N, 075°59W) took 55 days; it was ~2300 km across drifting ice and about 4000 km in total.

50|$|The RWR {{can be an}} {{important}} tool for evading threats if avoidance has failed. For example, if a SAM system or enemy fighter aircraft has fired a missile (for example, a SARH-guided missile) at the aircraft, the RWR may be able to detect the change in mode that the radar must use to guide the missile and notify the pilot with much more insistent warning tones and flashing, bracketed symbols on the RWR display. The pilot then can take evasive action to break the missile lock-on or dodge the missile. The pilot may even be able to visually acquire the missile after being alerted to the possible launch. What's more, if an actively guided missile is tracking the aircraft, the pilot can use the direction and distance display of the RWR to work out which evasive maneuvers to perform to outrun or dodge the missile. For example, the rate of closure and aspect of the incoming missile may allow the pilot to determine that if they dive away from the missile, it is unlikely to catch up, or if it is closing fast, {{that it is time to}} jettison <b>external</b> <b>supplies</b> and turn toward the missile in an attempt to out-turn it. The RWR may be able to send a signal to another defensive system on board the aircraft, such as a Countermeasure Dispensing System (CMDS), which can eject countermeasures such as chaff, to aid in avoidance.|$|E
30|$|In {{agricultural}} systems, high-density monoculture crops deplete soil minerals {{quickly and}} therefore rely on <b>external</b> <b>supplies</b> {{for most of}} their nutrients, particularly nitrogen, potassium (K) and phosphorus (Amtmann et al., 2006). A balanced supply of mineral nutrients is crucial for both quantity and quality of the crop, but rarely achieved in the field. Of the mineral nutrients, imbalanced nutrition with K is well known and becoming an important constraint to crop production in many areas (Cakmak, 2010).|$|E

In the sugar process, water requirements are the followings: imbibitions, process water use, lime make up water, flocculants make up water, filter wash, pan house requirements and service water requirements. The use of <b>external</b> <b>supplies</b> should be kept to a minimum, because they inflate the quantity to be disposed of ultimately.

40|$|SUMMARY: Chaetomium brasiliensis {{requires}} aneurin for growth, {{and calcium}} (strontium or barium), aneurin {{and a low}} nutrient level {{for the formation of}} asco-spores. Decreasing suboptimal doses of calcium progressively decrease the number of fertile perithecia until none is formed, the average perithecial size is reduced, but not the total number of perithecia. Above the optimum level, calcium delays formation of perithecia and ascospores and, ultimately, spore germination; it has no favourable effect on vegetative growth. The fungus appears able to synthesize aneurin slowly after growth is complete. Lilly & Barnett (1949) found that Chaetomium convolutum needs <b>external</b> <b>supplies</b> of both aneurin and biotin for growth and for ascospore formation. Apart from this, no essential vitamin requirements of Chaetomium species are known, although C. cochliodes fruits better in the presence of aneurin (Hawker, 1942) and that C. globosum fruits more quickly with added biotin (Buston & Basu, 1948). C. globosum and several other Chaetomium species, however, require calcium for the formation of mature perithecia and ascospore...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} manufacturing/remanufacturing {{system is}} considered {{in this paper}} {{with the aim of}} scheduling the operations of the manufacturing plant. The system is partially closed {{in the sense that the}} raw materials, necessary for assembling the final products, can be obtained both from an internal remanufacturing plant (which disassembles returned products) and from external suppliers. The manufacturing system is modelled as a flexible flow shop whose stages represent the different assembly phases leading to the final products. In this paper, an original event-based mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation is presented, whose objective consists of minimizing, as primary objective, the weighted number of tardy jobs and, as secondary ones, the fixed and variable purchase costs of raw materials possibly acquired from external suppliers. Due to the complexity of the problem, the MIP formulation can be used to solve only small instances. For this reason, a matheuristics is proposed, which consists of three interoperating mathematical programming models: the first model assigns the jobs to the machines; the second model sequences the jobs on the machines; the third model defines the <b>external</b> <b>supplies,</b> taking into account the component availability constraints.
