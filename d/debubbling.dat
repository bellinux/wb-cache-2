Meanwhile, the program Coulter LS 230 was opened and the option “use optical module ” was selected. After the instrument was ready, nanopure water was used to fill the sample port. When the chamber was filled the ‘Fill ’ button was pressed on the machine in order to activate the <b>debubbling</b> routine. The pump cycled on and off with increasing or decreasing speed throughout the routine. The pump settled at 50 % speed after a full cycle of the <b>debubbling</b> process was completed which lasted approximately 30 seconds. In the next step the pump was turned off and the machine was drained by pushing the drain plug. The water was collected in a beaker and discarded. This cleaning cycle was repeated 5 times in order to assure a clean sample chamber. After the cleaning process was completed, water was added to the sample port with-out filling it to the top in order leave space for the sample. It was recommended to leave empty at least 2 ml for the sample, but not more that 5 ml due to the problems that will occur from the pump entraining bubbles.

40|$|Since {{the first}} months of 1955, the design of a pump-oxygenator system and it 2 ̆ 7 s method of {{application}} of extracorporeal circulation has been studied in our experimental laboratory for the purpose of creation a most simplified Pump-oxygenator Apparatus. Modified Sigma-motor Pumps named by Type III and IV, have been created in our laboratory. The Output of the Pump Type III and IV were 2050 ml/min and 8300 ml/min respectively. Fundamental studies of the Pressure-flow characteristics of these pumps revealed the necessity for obtaining the optimum occlusive setting of the pressure plate to maintain stable flow in face of considerable variation in systemic resistence during perfusion. Hemolysis due to pumping action is a direct function of stroke volume rather than presence or absence of total occlusion in these pumps studied. On the base of fundamental research concerned efficiency of oxygenation and <b>debubbling,</b> the most simplified bubble oxygenator model I-IV have been constructed of two vinyl plastic tube employing the same principle of a vertical blood-oxygen mixing tube and an antifoam coated <b>debubbling</b> tube in our laboratory. The experiments of extracorporeal circulation utilizing those pump-oxygenator model I-IV have been done in 10 dogs, obtaining the results as follow : All of three dogs perfused with model I died within 24 hours. One of two dogs perfused with model II lived for five days and one of two dogs perfused with model III survived for three days. Finally there was one long term survival in three doge undergoing perfusion with model IV. A step-by-step improvement of oxygenator 2 ̆ 7 s design has carried out on the earlier models led to the configuration of the model IV proving no cardinal defect of it 2 ̆ 7 s function for extra-corporeal circulation. Subsutitution of a helical reservoir for the vertical glass reservoir for the final elimination of all bubbles in oxygenator model IV (modified De Wall 2 ̆ 7 s type) has improved the over all poor results described above. Of the total number of 19 dogs which were by-passed with the helix reservoir oxygenator, seven died within 24 hours, one lived for six days, and eight surived more than one week. In the first 11 dogs undergoing perfusion, the survival rate obtained was only 30 per cent. There was, however, survival rate of 86 per cent in the latter consecutive series of eight dogs perfused by well-drilled team. A striking improvement in survival rate was epecially evident when total body perfusion has been done by the highly disciplined team keeping a well-balanced in-and-out flow and an adequate application of the bubble exygenator.

40|$|Design {{features}} {{and operation of}} a signal compara-tor are described. The efficiency of continuous-flow analyzers is improved by allowing the bubbled stream to remain intact as it passes through the col-orimeter flow cell. The signal comparator eliminates the bubble artifact from the photodetector signal while allowing the signal produced from the fluid segment to remain intact. The instrument is reliable, easy to use, and does not require any adjustments by a technician. It has been demonstrated that the “debubbler ” used on continuous-flow analyzers greatly decreases system effi-ciency (1, 2). Habig et al. (1) eliminated {{the need for a}} <b>debubbler</b> by utilizing a “bubble-gating flow cell. ” Their device monitored flowcell conductance and deactivated the system output when bubbles passed through the pho-tometer flow cell.

40|$|A {{time lapse}} seismic {{comparison}} of subsurface movements {{before and after}} the 2011 Tohoku earthquake is presented in this report. In order to successfully conduct this comparison, an entire processing sequence from raw data until final time migrated had to be performed. This implied <b>debubbling,</b> frequency correction, common midpoint sorting, muting, velocity anal- ysis, normal moveout correction, stacking and pre-stack time migration. Despite some chal- lenges due to great depths, a satisfying result were obtained. The velocity analysis gave mainly responses as expected, and the normal moveout corrected midpoints confirmed acceptable ve- locity picks, as these appeared as horizontal reflectors. The work resulted in some clear and significant changes caused by the earthquake. At the shelf, a seabed uplift of 2 - 3 meters is found. Just east of the trench, on the other hand, an uplift of 20 - 30 meters is revealed. Hence, the uplift in the areas close to the trench is approximately ten times larger than at the shelf. A significant change in seismic amplitude and reflection pattern after the earthquake are found. As these changes are addressed to either density or velocity changes, a comparison between the two lines using the same velocity model is implemented. This is done in order to isolate the changes, trying to distinguish which physical parameters causing the ob- served differences. The majority of the observed time-lapse effects were still present when the same velocity model were used on both sections, indicating that density changes are the main reason for these changes.

40|$|Eutrophication, {{the over}} {{enrichment}} of nutrients in an aquatic system, {{is associated with}} harmful algal blooms, and as such is a serious environmental issue. Consequently, interest in the monitoring of nutrient concentrations in aquatic systems has increased in tandem with a burgeoning public and scientific awareness of environmental problems. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} number of flow analysis techniques for the monitoring of nutrient concentrations in natural waters; namely total phosphorus and total nitrogen, as well as the design and construction of a total internal reflective flow-cell for use in flow analysis systems. The portable flow analysis system for the determination of total phosphorus in natural waters was designed with rapid underway monitoring in mind. The digestion module consisted of a ultra-violet photo-reactor, thermal heating unit, in-line filter and debubbler, with sample being merged with an acidic peroxodisulfate digestion reagent. A multi-commutational flow analysis unit was used to introduce gaspressurised molybdenum blue chromogenic reagents using two miniaturised solenoid valves, followed by spectrophotometric detection using a multi-reflective flow cell with a light emitting diode source and photo-diode detector. The fully automated system has a throughput of 115 measurements per hour, a detection limit of 1. 3 μgPL- 1, is highly linear over the calibration range of 0 - 200 μgPL- 1 (r 2 = 0. 9998), and a precision of 4. 6 %RSD at 100 μgPL- 1 (n= 10). Shipboard field validation of the instrument and method was performed in Port Philip and Western Port Bays in Victoria, SE Australia, where 2499 analyses were performed over a 25 hour period, over a cruise path of 285 kilometres. Good agreement was observed between determinations of samples taken manually and analysed in the laboratory and those measured in situ with the flow analysis system. Historically, total nitrogen has been determined by Kjeldahl digestion or oxidative digestion to nitrate followed by reduction of the generated nitrate to nitrate by cadmium with spectrophotometric detection via the Griess assay. The Kjeldahl digestion does not measure nitrate and nitrite, and the reduction of nitrate to nitrite involves the use of a toxic cadmium reagent that degrades rapidly in the presence of residual oxidant. The flow analysis system developed for the measurement of total nitrogen involves photo-oxidation of all nitrogenous compounds in the presence of alkaline peroxodisulfate, with in-line filtration and <b>debubbling,</b> followed by ultraviolet second derivative spectrophotometric detection of the nitrate generated. A ten minute stop flow period in the photo-reactor removes a substantial amount of residual oxidant, which is a spectral interferent in the 220 nm range used to quantify nitrate. Second derivative spectroscopy is used to minimise interference from any residual oxidant, as well as other species such as sulfate. The fully automated system has a throughput of 5 measurements per hour taken in triplicate, has a detection limit of 0. 05 mgNL- 1, is highly linear over the calibration range of 0 - 2 mgNL- 1 (r 2 = 0. 9989), and features a precision of 1. 2 %RSD for 1 mgNL- 1 as ammonia (n = 10). Excellent agreement was found between storm water samples measured using the flow analysis system in comparison to those obtained using a reference method. The design and construction of a total internal reflective photometric flow-through cell is described. This cell consists of a tubular length of fused silica quartz capillary, where light is introduced and collected from the cell using quartz optical fibres. Incident light undergoes total internal reflection at the air-quartz external wall interface, and thus undergoes multiple reflections as it propagates through the capillary. This cell was found to have several desirable features in common with liquid core waveguides (efficient light throughput that leads to high signal to noise ratio, versatile choice of irradiant light wavelength) and coated capillary multireflective cells (low hydrodynamic dispersion, no entrapment of bubbles, high tolerance to refractive index effects) ...|$|E

The absorbance of the sample peaks is measured at 340 nm with a linear-a bsorba nce spectrophotometer. Peak heights are directly proportional to concentration, because logarithmic conversion is performed within the spectrophotometer. The method obeys Beer’s law up to 10 mg of P per deciliter, and results correlate closely with those for standard methods based on reduced phosphomolybdate blue.

40|$|VEGGIE is a {{plant growth}} {{facility}} that utilizes {{the phenomenon of}} capillary action as its primary watering system. A cloth made of Meta Aramid fiber, known as Nomex is used to wick water up from a reservoir {{to the bottom of}} the plants roots. This root mat system is intended to be low maintenance with no moving parts and requires minimal crew interface time. Unfortunately, the water wicking rates are inconsistent throughout the plant life cycle, thus causing plants to die. Over-wicking of water occurs toward the beginning of the cycle, while under-wicking occurs toward the middle. This inconsistency of wicking has become a major issue, drastically inhibiting plant growth. The primary objective is to determine the root cause of the inconsistent wicking through experimental testing. Suspect causes for the capillary water column to break include: a vacuum effect due to a negative pressure gradient in the water reservoir, contamination of material due to minerals in water and back wash from plant fertilizer, induced air bubbles while using syringe refill method, and material limitations of Nomex's ability to absorb and retain water. Experimental testing will be conducted to systematically determine the cause of under and over-wicking. Pressure gages will be used to determine pressure drop during the course of the plant life cycle and during the water refill process. A <b>debubbler</b> device will be connected to a root mat in order to equalize pressure inside the reservoir. Moisture and evaporation tests will simultaneously be implemented to observe moisture content and wicking rates over the course of a plant cycle.

40|$|Aerosol {{are solid}} or liquid {{particles}} {{suspended in the}} atmosphere {{ranging in size from}} 10 3 to 102 m. Aerosol influence both the regional and global climate of the earth by its direct and indirect effect. Role of atmospheric aerosols on the radiative forcing of atmosphere is a matter of serious research for past few decades and still it remains highly uncertain as acknowledged by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Heterogeneous nature of aerosol both spatially and temporally makes it more complex in estimating radiative forcing compared to that of greenhouse gases. Compounding to the existing difficulty in determining the climate effects, changing aerosol concentration and nature of the aerosol further increases the complexity in determining its effects in both regional and global climate. Increasing aerosol loading is emerging to be an issue of major concern over several regions. The first step towards achieving this goal is by determining the trends in the physical and optical properties of aerosol over the globe. Main objective of the thesis is the determination of the recent trends in aerosol loading over the globe and then to focus specifically on the properties of aerosol over an urban site in southern India. Specific objectives are (a) to determine the trend in aerosol physical and optical properties over the globe using AERONET surface observations (b) to characterize the chemical properties of water soluble inorganic aerosol over an urban site in Southern India, Bangalore (c) to have a better estimation of aerosol radiative forcing over Bangalore with measured aerosol chemical concentration, black carbon concentration and aerosol optical depth (AOD). To quantify the recent trends in aerosol loading over the globe, we have used the surface observations from AERONET and the study provided the first step in giving a global picture of the recent trends in the fundamental optical and physical property of aerosol. Trend analysis showed a significant spatial inhomogenity, and Asian continent clearly showed an increasing trend in AOD compared to other continents. Solar village (24. 9 oN, 46. 4 oE) of Saudi Arabia showed a maximum with a value of 0. 04 /yr and Bac -Giang (21 oN, 106 oE) of Vietnam showed the minimum value of - 0. 04 /yr. North American study region included 18 sites in which eastern US (E. US) exhibited a decreasing trend while the scenario in western US (W. US) is different with more of sites with increasing AOD trend. Single scattering albedo (SSA) trend in W. US showed a decreasing trend irrespective of the AOD trend. Study sites in South America include Cordoba -CETT (31. 5 oNS, 64. 5 oN W) Alta Floresta (9. 8 oS, 56. 1 o W), Riobranco (9. 9 oNS, 67. 8 o W) and Soa Poulo (23. 5 oS, 46. 7 o W). Except Riobranco which has a positive trend in AOD, all other sites exhibited a statistically signi cant negative trend. Over Australia, there is an inclination towards increasing AOD in sites and all the three sites in Australia exhibit a statistically significant increasing trend in SSA. According to the recent trends in AOD over African region, there exists a significant decrease in AOD compared to that reported for few years earlier, showing the high temporal in homogeneity and need for continuous observation of aerosol over the regions. European study region included 15 stations, among them only 3 sites showed an increasing trend in AOD, remaining 12 sites showed a significant decreasing trend in aerosol loading over the period of study. SSA was also observed to be decreasing over most of the European sites, even with a decreasing AOD over most of the sites. A Comparison study carried out to determine the relation of population growth rate and aerosol loading, and it revealed that the increasing AOD trend not always coincided with the sites having high population growth rate. Having determined the trends in AOD and other aerosol parameters over the globe and seeing an alarmingly increasing trend over most of the Asian sites, especially over Indian region, we have then focused over work on the aerosol properties of one of the rapidly growing urban location in southern India, Bangalore. While physical properties of aerosol have been extensively studied over Bangalore, chemical characteristics are still an unexplored area. Extensive information on aerosol chemical composition is not available over Indian region except for a few locations based on campaign mode. Even available data is of very coarse temporal resolution, since hours or full day sampling is needed to gather enough samples for chemical analysis. High temporal resolution data of aerosol chemical characteristics, especially for all season is completely lacking over Indian subcontinent. Among aerosol, water soluble aerosol form an important component in particulate matter, since it can change its size, composition, can easily mix with other aerosols and can act as cloud condensation nuclei, based on its hygroscopic nature. Present study provided the rst time results from a high temporal resolution water soluble inorganic aerosol chemical data over Indian region, which is first step towards estimating aerosol climate impacts more accurately. Water soluble inorganic aerosol ions over Bangalore namely, sulphate, nitrate, chloride, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium and ammonium are measured using Particle Into Liquid Sampler Ion Chromatograph (PILS-IC). PILS is an online sampling technique for quantitatively measuring the chemical concentration of ion in water soluble aerosol particles. PILS IC {{used in the present study}} is developed in Georgia Institute of Technology. Instrument samples ambient air at a flow rate of 16. 7 Lmin 1. Particles below PM 2. 5 micron are collected for the analysis using cyclone impactor. Two annular glass denuders are used to remove inorganic gases which else will interfere with the aerosol ion concentration. Ambient air which is deprived of the inorganic gases is then mixed with steam vapours at 150 oC, eventually high supersaturated atmosphere is produced with rapid adiabatic mixing of steam and ambient air. High supersaturated air allows droplets to grow enough to be collected by inertial impaction onto a quartz impactor plate. Entire PILS condensation unit is kept at a slight tilt of 15 o, to remove all condensate through drain tube connected to the end of the PILS condensate body. Condensed liquid sample is collected from the impaction chamber and known concentration LiF is allowed to mix with the collected sample at a constant rate. LiF known as carrier liquid is added to know the dilution occurring to the collected sample. Sample with carrier liquid is then collected to a <b>debubbler</b> and is supplied to the IC through peristaltic tubings for determining the ion chemical concentration. Seasonal variation of mass concentration of water soluble aerosol species and the influence of long range transport is carried out using HYSPILT back trajectory analysis. Marine air mass from Arabian Sea dominated the air parcel reaching the site for both SW monsoon and summer. Continental air mass dominated the site during both NE monsoon and winter with slight contribution from marine atmosphere. Source characteristics of sulphate, potassium, calcium and magnesium ions are carried out based on sea salt (ss) and non sea salt (nss) origin and it is observed that the nss contribution is dominant over the site for all these ions except magnesium where ss component comparatively dominates the source. SO 24 and NO 3 form the dominant anions while NH+ 4 makes the dominant cation species. Monthly variation of the ratio of ammonium to nss -sulphate is carried out to determine the possible cation -anion relation existing between these two major ions. During later winter and summer months ammonium bi sulphate is found to be the existing chemical form and ammonium sulphate during other seasons. High temporal resolution data enabled us to study the diurnal variation of aerosol ions and it is influenced by various mechanisms from boundary layer to local emissions. Optical properties of aerosols depend upon the size and the relative abun-dance of each components. It is usual practice to assume default aerosol chemical composition in radiative transfer models due to unavailability of data, which can lead to errors in forcing estimates. Incorporating realistic aerosol chemical composition in models is essential to reduce the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing. Hence we have included measured aerosol chemical compositions, black carbon and AOD to improve the determination of radiative forcing of aerosol. OPAC and SBDART models were used for estimating the aerosol radiative forcing over Bangalore. We have used mainly four components namely, soot, water soluble, sea salt and dust. Except dust all are other components are measured over the site and formed a constrain for the calculation. Dust concentration was altered so that the OPAC AOD matched the measured AOD within 5 %. Mineral dust shows the highest contribution in AOD among the four components, however water soluble and soot even being less is mass concentration compared to mineral dust, has significant impact on the AOD. This clearly indicate the influence of both water soluble and soot aerosol over the regional climate of the site. Sea Salt exhibited low AOD compared to other three constituents. The results presented in the thesis highlights the importance of varying trends in the aerosol properties and its effects on a global picture and speci - cally over an urban site in Indian region, we explored the temporal variations of water soluble inorganic aerosol ions and its effects on regional climate. Hence the thesis addressed some of the unexplored areas in aerosol science. This study also suggests the need of continuous observation of aerosol over both spatial and temporal scale, which is essential to estimate their effects on earth's climate...|$|R
