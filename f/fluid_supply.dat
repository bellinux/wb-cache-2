25|$|Mastitis is an {{inflammation}} of the breast. It causes local pain (dolor), redness (rubor), swelling (tumor), and warmth (calor). Later stages of mastitis cause symptoms of systemic infection like fever and nausea. It mostly occurs 2–3 weeks after delivery but can happen at any time. Typically results from milk stasis with primary or secondary local, later systemic infection. Infectious organisms include Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp. and E. coli. Continued breastfeeding, plenty of rest and adequate <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> is the best treatment for light cases.|$|E
2500|$|The 21st {{century has}} seen a new {{approach}} to jet packs where water is used as a high-density propulsion fluid. [...] This requires a very large mass of fluid that makes a self-contained jetpack infeasible. [...] Instead, this approach separates the engine, fuel and <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> from the pilot's flying apparatus, using a long flexible hose to feed the water to the jet nozzle pack attached to the pilot's body. [...] These inventions are known as [...] "hydro jet packs", and successful designs have used jetski technology as the powerplant operating in a body of water (an ocean, lake, or [...] pool) to provide the needed propulsion. Several hydro jet pack approaches have been successfully tested and put into production. Flow rate can be controlled by a throttle operator on the jetski, or by the pilot using a remote actuator.|$|E

50|$|In {{lactation}} mastitis, frequent emptying of both breasts by breastfeeding is essential. Also essential {{is adequate}} <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> {{for the mother}} and baby. Use of pumps to empty the breast is now considered somewhat controversial.|$|E
50|$|In a fluidic amplifier, a <b>fluid</b> <b>supply,</b> {{which may}} be air, water, or {{hydraulic}} fluid, enters at the bottom. Pressure applied to the control ports C1 or C2 deflects the stream, so that it exits via either port O1 or O2. The stream entering the control ports may be much weaker than the stream being deflected, so the device has gain.|$|E
50|$|The conduit {{bringing}} high-pressure {{water to}} the impulse wheel is called the penstock. Originally the penstock {{was the name of}} the valve, but the term has been extended to include all of the <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> hydraulics. Penstock is now used as a general term for a water passage and control that is under pressure, whether it supplies an impulse turbine or not.|$|E
30|$|The {{focal area}} of the 2008 {{earthquake}} is located where these two seismic zones and the seismic low-velocity zone in the lower crust are closely located. The presence of a low-velocity region just beneath the source region of the main shock of the 2008 earthquake (see Fig. 7 (c)) similarly suggests that <b>fluid</b> <b>supplied</b> from depth contributed to the occurrence of this earthquake.|$|R
50|$|Ports are {{openings}} in the manifold or distribution system where the inlet and outlet connections are produced. Each opening is either an inlet (supply) port or an outlet port.

50|$|Cholera is {{an acute}} diarrheal illness that {{caused by the}} gram-negative {{bacteria}} Vibrio cholerae. Cholera is most commonly contracted through the ingestion of water or food that is contaminated with the bacteria. Cholera results in severe watery diarrhea.

50|$|EOIL {{technology}} {{represents a}} unique class of hybrid electric gas high-energy laser {{with the potential}} to have inherently higher beam quality than solid state systems, while being more logistically friendly than current Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser (COIL) systems. The principal advantage of such an inherently high beam quality system is the trade of a relatively small fixed mass in electrical generation and heat exchanger hardware for the massive <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> and large tankage associated with COIL devices.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} vehicle, whether an excavator, a back-hoe or a front-end-loader, the {{auxiliary}} hydraulic system may vary. Vehicle interface fittings, length from pump to attachment and vehicle control systems require various configurations of an auxiliary hydraulic system. Auxiliary hydraulic systems usually include external fluid fittings to facilitate connecting and disconnecting the hydraulic <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> {{lines of the}} attachments to the vehicles' hydraulic pump. They also usually include valves configured to control the supply of hydraulic fluid through the fittings.|$|E

It is known that the original OBF was mixed and contained some amount of barite. To get a lower desired density, the 11  ppg OBF was diluted by adding the base oil (6.3  ppg). To get a higher density, {{as in the case}} of WBF, the 11  ppg OBF would also be weighted using barite or hematite.|$|R

50|$|The {{second stage}} {{features}} the reabsorption of the initially extravasated fluid and it usually lasts {{just as long}} as the leak phase. Intravascular fluid overload leads to polyuria and can cause flash pulmonary edema, with possibly fatal consequences. The severity of the problem depends on to the quantity of <b>fluid</b> <b>supplied</b> in the initial phase, the damage that may have been sustained by the kidneys, and the promptness with which diuretics are administered to help the patient discharge the accumulated fluids quickly.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{hydraulic}} brake system, the driver applies force by a mechanical link from the {{pedal to the}} master brake cylinder. In turn the master brake cylinder develops hydraulic pressure in the wheels. In contrast, the electro-hydraulic brake SBC provides the brakes with a brake <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> from the hydraulic high-pressure reservoir, which is sufficient for several braking events. A piston pump driven by an electric motor supplies a controlled brake fluid pressure between 140 and 160 Bar in the gas diaphragm reservoir.|$|E

50|$|This {{pulsatile flow}} {{generator}} produces a pulsating water flow by using flexible tubes, a collapsible elastic bladder and a <b>fluid</b> <b>supply.</b> This {{is a rare}} phenomenon which still isn't fully understood. What makes this phenomenon unique {{is the fact that}} it can generate a pulsatile flow without any use of difficult mechanical engines. There are existing pulsatile flow generators but none of them are as frugal and easy to build as this one. They are also expensive and none of them are based on principle of flow limitation occurring in collapsible tubes.|$|E

30|$|Low-velocity regions {{have been}} {{recognized}} just below the source regions of the 1962 North Miyagi earthquake (M 6.2), the 1996 Akita-Miyagi earthquake (M 5.9) (Nakajima and Hasegawa, 2003; Asano et al., 2004) (Fig. 7 (d)), the 1970 South Akita earthquake (M 6.2) (Umino et al., 2000) (Fig. 7 (b)), and the 2003 North Miyagi earthquake (M 6.4) (Okada et al., 2003; Umino et al., 2003) (Fig. 7 (e)). It thus appears that <b>fluid</b> <b>supplied</b> from a deeper portion contributed to the occurrence of these earthquakes (e.g., Miller et al., 2004).|$|R
30|$|Kato et al. (2007) {{suggested}} that the low-velocity zone imaged in the upper crust in the central section reflects velocity reduction of basement rocks by crustal fluids. We observe velocity reductions from average velocities of 1 – 4 % for P waves and 3 – 6 % for S waves in the low-velocity anomaly in the central section, which {{can be explained by}} the existence of H 2 O-filled pores with aspect ratio of ∼ 0.01 and a volume fraction of 0.2 – 0.3 % (Takei, 2002). The low-velocity anomaly at a depth of 10 km appears to be connected with the low-velocity anomaly below the seismogenic layer (Fig. 7), suggesting that <b>fluids</b> are <b>supplied</b> continuously from the lower crust and that effective pore pressure in that region becomes relatively high. Because the seismogenic layer is thickest in the central section, we infer that temperatures of aqueous <b>fluids</b> <b>supplied</b> to the central section are not so high (Fig. 12).|$|R
50|$|A flow {{focusing}} device {{consists of a}} pressure chamber pressurized with a continuous focusing <b>fluid</b> <b>supply.</b> Inside, one or more focused fluids are injected through a capillary feed tube whose extremity opens {{up in front of}} a small orifice linking the pressure chamber with the exterior ambient. The focusing fluid stream moulds the fluid meniscus into a cusp giving rise to a steady micro or nano-jet exiting the chamber through the orifice; the jet size is much smaller than the exit orifice, thus precluding any contact (which may lead to unwanted deposition or reaction). Capillary instability breaks up the steady jet into homogeneous droplets or bubbles.|$|E
50|$|The {{extension}} and retraction <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> ports on double acting hydraulic telescopic cylinders are usually located {{at opposite ends}} of the cylinder assembly. The extension port is mounted {{at the base of the}} outer barrel and the retraction port is mounted in the end of the plunger section. This can, in some applications, prove to be very difficult to connect with hydraulic hoses due to the distance between these ports at full extension. In such a circumstance, both ports can be located in the barrel. An internal passageway must be fitted, however, so that the retracting fluid is supplied to the plunger section at full extension. This special passageway is in itself a telescopic assembly that extends with the cylinder and is outfitted with seals on the various stages.|$|E
5000|$|An {{actuator}} subsystem preferably for a robot or bionic linkage. A joint {{between two}} robotic or bionic members includes at least {{first and second}} actuators such as piston-cylinder assemblies connected between the members. A hydraulic circuit includes a sensor subsystem for sensing {{the magnitude of the}} load on the piston-cylinder assemblies and/or members. A <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> system includes an actuatable control valve operable to supply fluid to one or both piston-cylinder assemblies. A control circuit is responsive to the sensor and is configured to electronically control the fluid subsystem to supply fluid to the first piston-cylinder assembly when the sensor subsystem senses a load below a predetermined magnitude and to supply fluid to both piston-cylinder assemblies when the sensor subsystem senses a load above the predetermined magnitude.Co-inventor: Aaron Saunders ...|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} our {{estimation}} of fluid sources suggest that the mode of transport differs between the Oomine Ridge and the Kumano mud volcanoes. In {{the case of the}} Kumano mud volcanoes, both source fluids in sediments and the sediments themselves ascend to the seafloor, whereas on the Oomine Ridge, the source fluids mix with SPF sediments and with fluid from MH dissociation as they ascend to the seafloor, although the sediments themselves do not ascend. These different modes of fluid transport are consistent with hydrocarbon distribution differences between the Kumano mud volcanoes and the Oomine Ridge. Hydrocarbons of thermogenic origin are found only in the Kumano mud volcanoes, even though the <b>fluids</b> <b>supplied</b> to both the seepage sites on the Oomine Ridge and the Kumano mud volcanoes originate in environments with temperatures of more than 50 °C (Toki et al. [2013]). CH 4 of microbial origin is distributed ubiquitously in the shallow sediments above several hundred meters below the seafloor in the accretionary prism off Kumano (Toki et al. [2012]). Thus, sediments containing hydrocarbons of thermogenic origin rise to the seafloor within the Kumano mud volcanoes and are observed in the pore fluids in the subsurface sediments. In contrast, the <b>fluids</b> <b>supplied</b> to the Oomine Ridge contain CH 4 of microbial origin from the shallow sediments through which the fluids passed during their ascent to the seafloor.|$|R
30|$|We {{interpret}} {{the difference in}} resistivity to represent a difference in elastic properties. The release of stress that had accumulated within the resistive region {{in the vicinity of}} the resistive-conductive boundary, probably led to the series of earthquakes. Increases in pore pressure from <b>fluids</b> <b>supplied</b> from the conductive zone may have been an additional cause of the earthquakes. Future dense MT observations made around the Futagawa and Hinagu faults and 3 -D inversion will contribute to improving the sharpness of resistivity structure images and will characterize seismicity more clearly from the viewpoint of its relationship with resistivity structure.|$|R
25|$|The pineal gland is {{the only}} midline brain {{structure}} that is unpaired (azygous). It {{takes its name from}} its pine-cone shape. The gland is reddish-gray and {{about the size of a}} grain of rice (5–8mm) in humans. The pineal gland, also called the pineal body, is part of the epithalamus, and lies between the laterally positioned thalamic bodies and behind the habenular commissure. It is located in the quadrigeminal cistern near to the corpora quadrigemina. It is also located behind the third ventricle and is bathed in cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>supplied</b> through a small pineal recess of the third ventricle which projects into the stalk of the gland.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cutting speed}} may be {{corrected}} with {{the temperature in}} the borehole, temperature of the working fluid, concentration, flow and pressure. (these components are enough to completely control the depth and length of the cut and thus forming the slots), to instantly cut through the steel casing, through the cement to delve into the productive formation and keep the jets in this state while moving along the borehole, keeping the same depth of cut. At the end of the cutting continuous slot process the engine is set up to the initial position and ready for the next cutting interval. The process of hydro-slotting perforation and the depth of cut is controlled by the working <b>fluid</b> <b>supply,</b> pressure and concentration. The equipment can be operated without lifting on the surface for 11-15 hours.|$|E

5000|$|The {{drive for}} the front wheels comes from a {{transfer}} case bolted {{on the end of}} an almost traditional Nissan RWD transmission.

30|$|It {{is known}} that the {{presence}} of pore <b>fluids</b> <b>supplied</b> from the subducted slab affects earthquake and volcano activities in subduction zones (e.g., Katayama et al. 2012; Kawamoto et al. 2015; Nakajima and Hasegawa 2016).

Elucidating temporal variations in fluid flow will help us to understand the generation mechanisms of long-term slow slip events (LSSEs) and eventually a part of the water budget in subduction zones (Hirschmann and Kohlstedt 2012).|$|R
