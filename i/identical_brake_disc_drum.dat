An {{automatic parking brake}} release, two-way power seats, power front <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> (rear <b>drum),</b> an indicator light for the headlight doors, and adjustable head restraints were all standard features.|$|R
50|$|Drum brakes {{generally}} can {{be found}} on older car and truck models. However, because of their low production cost, drum brake setups are also installed on the rear of some low-cost newer vehicles.

50|$|The {{cars had}} a {{separate}} chassis with independent suspension by coil springs {{at the front}} and a live axle with half-elliptical leaf springs at the rear. The brakes on early cars were operated by a hybrid hydro-mechanical system but became fully hydraulic in 1950. Girling <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> replaced <b>drums</b> at the front from October 1959.|$|R
50|$|At the 2015 LA Auto Show, Mitsubishi previewed the Mirage's 2017 facelift. The {{car will}} receive a new front end design, {{projector}} headlights with LED daytime running lights, and LED taillights. The facelift results in a drag coefficient of 0.27cd. In addition, the Mirage's suspension will be improved with better shock absorbers, revised spring rates, and uprated <b>brakes</b> (<b>discs</b> on front, <b>drums</b> on rear). The interior will also see numerous aesthetic changes from the steering wheel to the HVAC system and a new optional touchscreen infotainment system using Apple's CarPlay interface and a 300W Rockford Fosgate audio setup.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{separate}} the sportier variants Coupé and Spider from the basic version, apart from the increase of engine performance, the equipment was also extended and adapted to the higher expectations. Both received sport seats, a sport steering wheel and round speedometer; Spider even received a completely rearranged instrument panel. The front drum brakes were replaced with <b>disc</b> <b>brakes,</b> although <b>drum</b> brakes remained on the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|The car had a steel {{backbone}} chassis with outriggers {{fore and}} aft to support the running gear. Wishbones and coil spring independent suspension provided good handling, it was claimed. The front <b>brakes</b> were <b>discs</b> while <b>drums</b> served at the rear. The GRP body was bonded to this chassis and plywood floorpan. The engine was a Ford straight-four OHV unit {{with a choice of}} 997 cc or 1500 cc capacity. With the larger engine, a 0 to 60 mi/h km/h time of 8.5 seconds was boasted with a top speed of 115 mi/h km/h.|$|R
40|$|In the vehicles, {{there are}} many {{components}} which has important role beside the major role as a transportation tool. And each of vehicles {{has one of the}} parts which important like brake. It is used to stop the vehicle when it runs or parks. According to the reason above, the researcher was interested in investigating about this brake system deeply. And the problems that was rised were: 1. The factors which affect the braking ability, 2. Doing the treatment of brake economically, 3. Knowing the pressure power of the types of <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> and <b>drum</b> brake, 4. The power of braking and the amount of pressure, 5. The analysis of the comparation between the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> and <b>drum</b> brake. Furthermore, the quantitative was used in this research because it refered to the empiric data. And this research used some of the method such as: field observation, literature of the data and from the guidance. From the result of the study could be known that combination usage of the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> in front wheel and drum brake in rear wheel was better because the vehicle load will rest on the front wheel of the vehicle when it was braking. Therefore, the front wheel needs types of brake which has great pressure and fast like <b>disc</b> <b>brake.</b> In addition, the treatment is needed once in month like cheking the oil brake, brake lining and the others...|$|R
50|$|The car used <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> at the front, {{and either}} <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> or <b>drum</b> brakes at the rear, {{depending}} on the model. Brake pad wear warning via an instrument panel indicator light was a notable innovation. The steering was a rack and pinion system. The Peugeot 504 was widely available with diesel engines and an automatic transmission option, which was a rare combination at the time. Engines were of the Indenor design and included 1948 cc, 2112 cc, and a 2304 cc. The Indenor engine was also used in the Peugeot 403, Peugeot 404, Peugeot 505, Peugeot 604, Peugeot J7, Peugeot J9, Peugeot P4, Ford Sierra, Ford Granada, Talbot Tagora, Mahindra Jeep, Leyland DAF 400, Cournil 4x4/UMM 4x4 Cournil, UMM 4x4, Belgian-assembled Scaldia-Volga M21,M22, M24D (GAZ-21, GAZ-24), Opel Blitz and for marine application.|$|R
50|$|The car {{employed}} {{rack and}} pinion steering. At the front it had <b>disc</b> <b>brakes,</b> with <b>drum</b> brakes controlled via a dual-line hydraulic system at the rear. Suspension was independent, employing MacPherson struts at the front and an unusual combination of full-width swing axles and half-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. The front suspension was substantially modified after the car's initial presentation: production cars incorporated modified front suspension geometry, a lowered steering ratio and a steering damper, intended to reduce the unusually strong self-centring propensity which was {{a feature of the}} pre-production cars originally presented to journalists. The cars as sold also incorporated an updated gear-box and final drive ratios along with re-sized wheels.|$|R
25|$|Automobile brakes {{inherently}} rely on friction, slowing {{a vehicle}} by converting its kinetic energy into heat. Incidentally, dispersing this {{large amount of}} heat safely is one technical challenge in designing brake systems. Disk brakes rely on friction between a <b>disc</b> and <b>brake</b> pads that are squeezed transversely against the rotating <b>disc.</b> In <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes,</b> brake shoes or pads are pressed outwards against a rotating cylinder (brake drum) to create friction. Since <b>braking</b> <b>discs</b> can be more efficiently cooled than <b>drums,</b> <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> have better stopping performance.|$|R
50|$|The 430 {{series was}} {{produced}} from 1979 through 1983. Engines largely carried {{over from the}} previous generation. Most export markets received the 2.8 L L28 OHC I6 or the new LD28 diesel version, and was called the Datsun 280C. For taxi use in Singapore and Hong Kong, the 2.2-liter diesel engine was still available in {{what was called the}} 220C; this model was also sold as a sedan or van in Japan until it was cancelled with the 1981 facelift. This was the first generation Cedric with available four-wheel <b>disc</b> <b>brakes,</b> although <b>drums</b> all around were fitted to the cheapest versions. Styling was achieved with the cooperation of Pininfarina, providing a cleaner image than the previous generation. The rear suspension was upgraded to a rigid link coil system.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of fuel efficiency and light weight components in automobile sectors {{have led to}} the development of advanced material parts with improved performance. A specific class of MMCs which has gained a lot of attention due to its potential is aluminium metal matrix composites (Al-MMCs). Product performance investigation of Al-MMCs is presented in this article, where an Al-MMCs <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> is analyzed using finite element analysis. The objective is to identify the potentiality of replacing the conventional iron <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> with Al-MMCs <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> The simulation results suggested that the MMCs <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> provided better thermal and mechanical performance as compared to the conventional cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> Although, the Al-MMCs <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> dissipated higher maximum temperature compared to cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>disc’s</b> maximum temperature. The Al-MMCs <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> showed a well distributed temperature than the cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> The high temperature developed at the ring of the disc and heat was dissipated in circumferential direction. Moreover, better thermal dissipation and conduction at <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> rotor surface played a major influence on the stress. As a comparison, the maximum stress and strain of Al-MMCs <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> was lower than that induced on the cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>disc...</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>discs</b> are an {{important}} component found in almost all moving vehicles. Safety and reliability are crucial for braking systems. Several types of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> used in rail vehicles are mainly divided into two groups: axle-mounted <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> and wheel-mounted <b>brake</b> <b>discs.</b> There are also other designs, like separate <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> axles and end-axle-mounted <b>brake</b> <b>discs.</b> <b>Brake</b> <b>discs</b> are usually made from grey cast iron, nodular cast iron or steel, depending on the loads to which they will be subjected. The use of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> prevents {{the surface of the}} rolling wheel itself from braking and thus increases the lifespan of and reduces stress on the wheels. Divided <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> were developed to facilitate replacement of the <b>brake</b> <b>discs,</b> making the process less time consuming and less expensive, as it eliminates the need to disassemble the entire axle assembly. Disassembly of the axle can cause other problems as well, since all of the parts, like the wheels and bearings, are press fit onto the axle, and disassembly risks damaging them.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} model usually {{featured a}} choice of a 1407 cc OHV (T) or 1588 cc OHV (2T) engine, choice of a four-speed manual gearbox, two-speed automatic gearbox or three-speed automatic gearbox and front-wheel <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> (<b>drum</b> brakes on the lowest model). It was revised in 1972 with a restyled body, new rear light cluster, filler cap repositioned in the rear quarter panel, restyled front grille and fascia. The specification was once again revised in 1974 including sealed cooling system, improved brakes, restyled wheels with flared wheel arches, and restyled interior fittings.In late October 1975 (on sale 1 November), the Carina received a new front and rear-end styling, dual-line braking system with servo, and a repositioned handbrake and gear lever in a modified dashboard. The wheelbase and tread were increased slightly, as for the sister Celica series. Some chassis codes were accordingly changed, and the Japanese market cars received a plethora of altered engines, ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 liters.|$|R
40|$|During braking, heat is {{generated}} due to frictional {{contact between the}} brake pads and the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> (rotor) of a vehicle. At elevated temperatures, brake fade may occur, leading to potentially catastrophic brake failure in a vehicle. The heat-dissipating characteristic of a <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> is a function both of the physical design of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc,</b> and also the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> material. This research focuses {{on the effect of}} <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> design, in particular, how the surface temperature is affected by increasing the surface area of a <b>brake</b> <b>disc’s</b> ventilated channel. The surface temperature of a newly developed <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> with a wire woven porous ventilated channel (the design of which is not part of this research) will be compared to existing commercially available designs, and the parameters governing transient thermal response for solid, ventilated, and porous <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> during extended <b>braking</b> will be identified and compared. The results of this research reveal that the thermal capacity of a <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> determines the initial rate of <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> temperature increase (T), resulting in initial temperatures being T(solid disc) T(pin-finned disc) >T(WBD disc) due to the increased convective surface area and addition of forced convection in the ventilated channels.

40|$|Design of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> {{geometry}} {{for a given}} <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> material {{provides an}} opportunity for improvement in the fatigue life of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> High thermomechanical loads at braking lead to substantial local plastification and also induce tensile residual stresses in certain areas of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> This contributes to shortening of the fatigue life of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> by possible initiation and growth of cracks. In the present paper, a simulation approach for evaluation of <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> designs with respect to thermomechanical performance is developed and applied. <b>Brake</b> <b>disc</b> performance is analysed using commercial finite element software by employing a constitutive model for grey cast iron implemented in a Fortran subroutine. The thermal loading consists of consecutive severe braking cycles at a constant brake power and a constant speed, with cooling between the brake cycles. Based on a previous experimental study, three different assumptions are made regarding the spatial distribution of the thermal load at braking. A standard commercial <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> made from grey cast iron having straight vanes is used as the reference case. Geometrical modifications are introduced in the ventilation arrangement using a design-of-experiments approach, studying both straight cooling vanes and different pillar layouts. A preliminary assessment of the fatigue life of the <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> is carried out. The results indicate that the introduction of different pillar arrangements instead of straight vanes make it possible to decrease the mass of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> by up to 13 % or to increase the fatigue life of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> by about 50 %...|$|R
40|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the automotive industry since it concerns directly with safety. In order to develop proper heat ventilation a wide range of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> have been designed. Different types of physical <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> geometries, as front- and back-vented <b>brake</b> <b>discs,</b> affect the heat ventilation directly. This is a vital factor of the brake’s capability. We recognized the importance of this circumstance and therefore attempted to create a test to investigate the temperature gradient of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> in order to evaluate the coefficients of heat convection. The coefficients were modified by the change of temperature distribution in both <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> under the forced heat convection in steady state conditions. However, the heat radiation value does not take into account that the heat convection is dominated by the physical geometry of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> To set up the experimental test for investigating the heat transfer by convection the JASO C 406 standard is adopted. The experimental results in terms of heat convection coefficients are used in the numerical simulation via the finite element method in order to study the temperature diffusion and heat ventilation of front and back-vented <b>brake</b> <b>discs.</b> Conse-quently, the experimental results reveal that the overall heat convection coefficients of the front-vented <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> are higher than these of the back-vented one. In other words the simulation yields that the front-vented <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> allows stronger heat ventilation than its compared object, leading to larger temperature differences between outboard and inboard rotors, resulting in more thermal stress. This makes it more susceptible to be damaged during operation. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Disc</b> <b>brakes</b> rely on {{pliability}} of caliper {{seals and}} slight runout to release pads, leading to drag, fuel mileage loss, and <b>disc</b> scoring. <b>Drum</b> <b>brake</b> return springs give more positive action and, adjusted correctly, often have less drag when released.
