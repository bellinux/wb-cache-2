5000|$|<b>Expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> {{were given}} the name Dum-dum, or dumdum, after an early British example {{produced}} in the Dum Dum Arsenal, near Calcutta, India by Captain Neville Bertie-Clay. There were several <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> produced by this arsenal for the [...]303 British cartridge, including soft point and hollow point designs. These were not the first <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets,</b> however; hollow point <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> were commonly used for hunting thin skinned game in express rifles {{as early as the}} mid-1870s. The use of the term [...] "Dum-dum", applied to <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> other than the early [...]303 designs, is considered slang by most ammunition and ballistics sources. Manufacturers have many terms to describe the particular construction of the various types of <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets,</b> though most fall into the category of soft point or hollow point designs. The expansion itself is sometimes called mushrooming.|$|R
50|$|The German protests were effective, however, {{resulting}} in the ban {{of the use of}} <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> in warfare. The British replaced the hollow-point bullets with new full metal jacket bullets, and used the remaining stocks of <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> for practice.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Methuen's {{statement}} differs, {{as will be}} seen, very widely from Mr. Stead's; for Mr. Stead says Mafeking, and Mr. Methuen says {{north of}} Mafeking. There was a very great deal of fighting at Mafeking, and comparatively little north of Mafeking during that time, so that the difference is an essential one. To test Mr. Stead's assertion about Mafeking, I communicated with General Baden-Powell, the gentleman who is most qualified to speak as to what occurred there, and his answer lies before me: 'We had no expanding bullets in our supply at Mafeking, unless you call the ordinary Martini-Henry an <b>expanding</b> <b>bullet.</b> I would not have used them on humane principles, and moreover, an Army order had been issued {{against the use of}} dum-dum bullets in this campaign.

50|$|A soft-point bullet (SP), {{also known}} as a soft-nosed bullet, is a {{jacketed}} <b>expanding</b> <b>bullet</b> with a soft metal core enclosed by a stronger metal jacket left open at the forward tip. A soft-point bullet is intended to expand upon striking flesh to cause a wound diameter greater than the bullet diameter. Jacketed soft point is usually abbreviated JSP in the ammunition and reloading industry.|$|E

50|$|A hollow-base bullet is an <b>expanding</b> <b>bullet</b> {{that has}} a pit or {{hollowed}} out shape in its base often intended to cause the bullet to expand upon firing a cartridge in order to expand the base against the barrel grooves and obturate the bullet more as it travels through the barrel. It is also used for improved aerodynamic stability and accuracy as hollow-base bullets are usually front-weighted which enhances their aerodynamic stability.|$|E

5000|$|Bullet {{expansion}} in handguns is desirable not solely for incapacitation, but also so the bullet will not exit the target. An <b>expanding</b> <b>bullet</b> will {{stop in the}} target and [...] "dump" [...] all its energy there, rather than overpenetrating and possibly endangering people behind the target.

According to the International Committee of the Red Cross's customary international law study, customary international law now prohibits their use in any armed conflicts. This has been disputed by the United States that maintains that the use of <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> can be legal when there is a clear military necessity.The adoption of an amendment to Article 8 at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute in Kampala makes the use of <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> in non-international armed conflict a war crime.|$|R

5000|$|None {{of these}} methods truly {{consider}} bullet construction, {{with the exception of}} TKO, which dealt mainly with solid bullets. An <b>expanding</b> <b>bullet,</b> for example, may have better [...] "stopping" [...] power over another design, due to its increased wound channel as the jacket opens, even though it may be traveling at a lower velocity. Just as a large diameter solid, at low velocity may have better [...] "stopping" [...] power, due to its deep penetration, than a small diameter hollowpoint at max velocity.|$|E
5000|$|Armor-Piercing, M1917: The M1917 was {{the first}} service-issue Armor-Piercing rifle {{ammunition}} used by the US Army. It had a steel core in a lead envelope with a partial cupro-nickel jacket which had an exposed soft tip. The exposed tip was designed {{to aid in the}} envelope peeling away on impact to allow the core to strike the target. It had the unintended effect of making the thin lead envelope an <b>expanding</b> <b>bullet.</b> Since expanding bullets were seen as violating the Hague Convention it did not see service in World War I.|$|E
50|$|Because the Hague {{convention}} {{applies only}} {{to the use of}} <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> in war, the use of expanding rounds remains legal. Examples of this are use of appropriately <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> in hunting, where it is desirable to stop the animal quickly either to prevent loss of a game animal, or ensure a humane death of vermin, and in law enforcement or self-defence, where quickly neutralising an aggressor may be needed to prevent further loss of life, or where the bullet must remain inside the target to prevent collateral damage.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: A hollow point, <b>expanding</b> <b>bullet</b> {{before and}} after firing. Expanding bullets, also known as dum dums, expand after impact, {{creating}} a bigger wound inside victims. Such bullets are considered inhumane and banned by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 for use in warfare, but {{can be used for}} hunting and other purposes. Many including Jiang Yanyong, one of the PLA's leading surgeons, who treated civilian casualties at the 301 Military Hospital on the night of June 3, have reported that the military used expanding bullets in western Beijing.|$|E
50|$|A hollow-point bullet is an <b>expanding</b> <b>bullet</b> {{that has}} a pit or {{hollowed}} out shape in its tip often intended to cause the bullet to expand upon entering a target in order to decrease penetration and disrupt more tissue as it travels through the target. It is also used for controlled penetration, where over-penetration could cause collateral damage (such as aboard an aircraft). In target shooting, they are used for greater accuracy and reduction of smoke, fouling, and lead vapor exposure, as hollow point bullets have an enclosed base while traditional bullets have an exposed lead base.|$|E
50|$|The final {{category}} of bullets is that intended to control penetration {{so as not}} to harm anything behind the target. Such bullets are used primarily for hunting and civilian antipersonnel use; they are not generally used by the military, since the use of <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> in international conflicts is prohibited by the Hague Convention and because these bullets have less chance of penetrating modern body armor. These bullets are designed to increase their surface area on impact, thus creating greater drag and limiting the travel through the target. A desirable side effect is that the <b>expanded</b> <b>bullet</b> makes a larger hole, increasing tissue disruption and speeding incapacitation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> are {{designed}} to expand on impact, sometimes as much as twice the diameter. This will slow the bullet down and more of its kinetic energy will {{be transferred to the}} target, creating a larger wound channel. For this reason <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> are often used in hunting because their stopping power increases the chance of a quick kill. There are a number of designs used for hunting different game and for use in weapons with different muzzle velocities. Bullets used for medium and large game need better penetration, which means bullets designed to maintain integrity and for less expansion. The velocities at which the bullets hit affect their expansion and penetration.|$|R
5|$|Since the 5.7×28mm SS190 {{projectile}} {{does not}} rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a hollow-point bullet, the cartridge (and 5.7×28mm firearms) are considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of <b>expanding</b> <b>bullets</b> in warfare.|$|R
