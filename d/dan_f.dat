40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} aim focused onthe {{interpretation of the}} action of pupils for two school professors in mathematics and in physical education. The research is {{in the field of}} work concerned with the process of didactic contextalisation (Delcroix, Forissier, Anciaux, 2012). It also mobilizes process of the comparative approach (Mercier, Schubauer-Leoni et Sensevy, 2002). Data processed within the limits of this communication were collected by interview of self-confrontation. The results are used to model the interpretive filters according to three axes: the practical epistemology of the professor through the categories of Shulman (1987), forms of inference employed and his organization. Our study allows us to confront, in this model, the specifics or generics, fruits of disciplinary didactics to the effects of the didactic contextualization. We note that the use of contextualization seems to act as a filter (regardless of the teacher or the discipline concerned) constitutive of a profile kind (in the sense of Clot). Finally, {{at the end of this}} research, we discuss the contribution of this type of study for the training of teachers by querying the aspect built of these filters in action-context interaction and by validating the legitimacy of this question: "What is happening in the minds of the students"?Clot, Y. et Faïta, D.

Great importance of the favourable wind «mistral» which blows away the pollutions towards S.
