25|$|The reggae organ-shuffle {{is unique}} to reggae. In the {{original}} version of reggae, the drummer played a reggae groove {{that was used in}} the four bar introduction, allowing the piano to serve as a percussion instrument. Typically, a Hammond organ-style sound is used to play chords with a choppy <b>feel.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> known as the bubble. This may be the most difficult reggae keyboard rhythm. The organ bubble can be broken down into 2 basic patterns. In the first, the 8th beats are played with a space-left-right-left-space-left-right-left pattern, where the spaces represent downbeats not played—that and the left-right-left falls on the ee-and-a, or and-2-and if counted at double time. In the second basic pattern, the left hand plays a double chop as described in the guitar section while the right hand plays longer notes on beat 2 (or beat 3 if counted at double time) or a syncopated pattern between the double chops. Both these patterns can be expanded on and improvised embellishments are sometimes used.|$|E

25|$|Some {{persons have}} a {{disorder}} of consciousness (DOC). This state is defined to include persons with coma, {{as well as}} persons in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). New BCI research seeks to help persons with DOC in different ways. A key initial goal is to identify patients {{who are able to}} perform basic cognitive tasks, which would of course lead to a change in their diagnosis. That is, some persons who are diagnosed with DOC may in fact be able to process information and make important life decisions (such as whether to seek therapy, where to live, and their views on end-of-life decisions regarding them). Some persons who are diagnosed with DOC die as a result of end-of-life decisions, which may be made by family members who sincerely <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> in the patient's best interests. Given the new prospect of allowing these patients to provide their views on this decision, there {{would seem to be a}} strong ethical pressure to develop this research direction to guarantee that DOC patients are given an opportunity to decide whether they want to live.|$|E

He continued {{on the subject of}} Wank Week, [...] "we <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> exactly the type of provocative and mischievous programming that Channel 4 should be covering in the 11pm slot" [...] In the United Kingdom, the 11pm slot is considered post-watershed, defined by the regulator Ofcom in the Broadcasting Code as later than 9pm (although transition to more adult material [...] "must not be unduly abrupt at the watershed or after the time when children are particularly likely to be listening" [...] according to section 1.6). This allows the broadcasting of more sexually explicit content.|$|E

He credits Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire's coach and former Australia international fast bowler, with helping him regain his confidence and felt that his problems had been exacerbated by over-coaching. In an interview in June 2014 Plunkett explained [...] "Different coaches told me different things and when you're a youngster you're like a sponge and {{take a lot of}} things in.... When I came to Yorkshire, Jason Gillespie just told me to run it and bowl quick. And when I did that I backed myself, bowled in my good areas and started picking up wickets." [...] Under the tutelage of Yorkshire coach and former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, Plunkett's fortunes improved and he was awarded his county cap in 2013. The following year, Plunkett was recalled to the England Test team.|$|E
