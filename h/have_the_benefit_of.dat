5|$|When {{warfarin}} is newly started, it may promote clot formation temporarily. This {{is because}} the level of protein C and protein S are also dependent on vitamin K activity. Warfarin causes decline in protein C levels in first 36 hours. In addition, reduced levels of protein S lead {{to a reduction in}} activity of protein C (for which it is the co-factor) and therefore reduced degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa. Although loading doses of warfarin over 5mg also produce a precipitous decline in factor VII, resulting in an initial prolongation of the INR, full antithrombotic effect does not take place until significant reduction in factor II occurs days later. The haemostasis system becomes temporarily biased towards thrombus formation, leading to a prothrombotic state. Thus, when warfarin is loaded rapidly at greater than 5mg per day, it is beneficial to co-administer heparin, an anticoagulant that acts upon antithrombin and helps reduce the risk of thrombosis, with warfarin therapy for four to five days, in order to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> anticoagulation from heparin until the full effect of warfarin has been achieved.|$|E

25|$|Because {{graduates}} did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> accredited degrees, {{the faculty}} felt an increased responsibility to prepare their students.

Undoubtedly helpful was that some of the university's strongest programs were in the areas of music, speech, and art, disciplines in which ability could be measured by audition or portfolio rather than through paper qualifications.|$|E
25|$|While this {{provides}} a valid proof (for matrices over the complex numbers), {{the argument is}} not very satisfactory, since the identities represented by the theorem do {{not in any way}} depend {{on the nature of the}} matrix (diagonalizable or not), nor on the kind of entries allowed (for matrices with real entries the diagonalizable ones do not form a dense set, and it seems strange one would have to consider complex matrices to see that the Cayley–Hamilton theorem holds for them). We shall therefore now consider only arguments that prove the theorem directly for any matrix using algebraic manipulations only; these also <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> working for matrices with entries in any commutative ring.|$|E
25|$|Under Maryland Act of Assembly 1796, Chapter 67, any enslaved person {{brought into}} the state by an owner {{for the purpose of}} sale, would be granted freedom.

If they were removed from the state before the three years had elapsed, the slaves would be granted freedom. Along with creating legal opportunities for slaves to gain freedom, the 1796 Maryland Act of Assembly also secured for petitioners in freedom suits the right “to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> a trial by jury.” With this right, enslaved persons were given the power to petition their owners in court based on being illegally transported into or out of the state.|$|E

25|$|Deck v. Missouri is a {{significant}} case because it outlines new rights given to convicted defendants. In this case, the majority held {{that even though the}} defendant had been convicted of capital crimes, he still should <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the presumption of innocence (to a certain degree). Also, the Court held that such a defendant has a right to having {{a significant}} defense. Furthermore, the court stated that during the sentencing phase of his trial, Deck deserved the right to participate in “dignified courtroom proceedings.” This decision gave Deck constitutional rights just after he had been convicted of multiple capital crimes. This means that an accused defendant has the same rights as a convicted defendant. Rights that only protected defendants in the guilty phase now protect defendants in the penalty phase. This is of profound significance.|$|E
25|$|Through the 1796 Maryland Act of Assembly, enslaved {{persons were}} given more {{opportunities}} to gain freedom; but, in the same document, the rights of free blacks were reduced.

A proviso stated that any person intending to settle in Maryland was lawfully able to import his slaves from out of state as long as his slaves remained in the state for three years. If the slaves were removed from the state before three years, they would be granted freedom.

25|$|Superelevation {{slopes of}} 4 to 10% are applied {{in order to}} aid motorists in safely {{traversing}} these sections, while maintaining vehicle speed throughout {{the length of the}} curve. An upper bound of 12% was chosen {{to meet the demands of}} construction and maintenance practices, as well as to limit the difficulty of driving a steeply cross-sloped curve at low speeds. In areas that receive significant snow and ice, most agencies use a maximum cross slope of 6 to 8%. While steeper cross slope makes it difficult to traverse the slope at low speed when the surface is icy, and when accelerating from zero with warm tyres on the ice, lower cross slope increases the risk of loss-of-control at high speeds, especially when the surface is icy. Since the consequence of high speed skidding is much worse than that of sliding inward at a low speed, sharp curves <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> greater net safety when designers select up to 8% superelevation, instead of 4%. A lower slope of 4% is commonly used on urban roadways where speeds are lower, and where a steeper slope would raise the outside road edge above adjacent terrain.|$|E

25|$|Training was {{extended}} {{from two years}} to four, with the resulting need for more accommodation for cadets. A second cadet establishment was constructed at Osborne on the Isle of Wight {{for the first two}} years, with the last two remaining at Dartmouth. All cadets now received an education in science and technology as it related to life on board a ship as well as navigation and seamanship. Those who went on to be command officers would now <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> improved understanding of their ships while those who became engineers would be better equipped for command. Physical education and sport were to be taught, not only {{for the benefit of the}} cadets but also for the future training of ships' crews which were expected to produce sporting teams on good-will visits in foreign ports. Entrance by examination, which biased the intake to those who could obtain special tuition, was replaced with an interview committee tasked with determining the general knowledge of candidates and their reaction to the questions as much as their answers. After the four years, cadets were posted to special training ships for final practical experience before being posted to real command positions. The results of the final examination affected the seniority allotted to each cadet and his chance of future early promotion.|$|E
25|$|To Meade's right, Gibbon's {{division}} {{prepared to}} move forward at 1 p.m. Brig. Gen. Nelson Taylor proposed to Gibbon that they supplement Meade's assault with a bayonet charge against Lane's position. However, Gibbon stated that this would violate his orders, so Taylor's brigade did not move forward until 1:30p.m. The attack did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> a gap to exploit, nor did the Union soldiers have any wooded cover for their advance, so progress was slow under heavy fire from Lane's brigade and Confederate artillery. Immediately following Taylor was the brigade of Col. Peter Lyle, and the advance of the two brigades {{ground to a halt}} before they reached the railroad. Committing his reserve at 1:45p.m., Gibbon sent forward his brigade under Col. Adrian R. Root, which moved through the survivors of the first two brigades, but they were soon brought to a halt as well. Eventually some of the Federals reached the crest of the ridge and had some success during hand-to-hand fighting—men on both sides had depleted their ammunition and resorted to bayonets and rifle butts, and even empty rifles with bayonets thrown like javelins—but they were forced to withdraw back across the railroad embankment along with Meade's men to their left. Gibbon's attack, despite heavy casualties, had failed to support Meade's temporary breakthrough and Gibbon himself was wounded when a shell fragment struck his right hand. Brig. Gen Nelson Taylor took over command of the division.|$|E
25|$|Although oak barrels {{have long}} been used by winemakers, many wineries now use oak wood chips for aging wine more quickly and also adding desired woody aromas along with vanilla flavors. It is a common {{misconception}} that oak imparts butter flavors to wine. This is not so. The butter flavors come from lactic acid, naturally present in the wine, converted during malolactic fermentation to diacetyl. This process reverses itself, although the addition of sulfur dioxide prevents this, and the diacetyl remains. Oak chips can be added during fermentation or during aging. In the latter case, they are generally placed into fabric sacks and placed into the aging wine. The diversity of chips available gives winemakers numerous options. Oak chips <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> imparting intense oak flavoring {{in a matter of}} weeks while traditional oak barrels would need a year or more to convey similar intensity. Critics claim that the oak flavoring from chips tend to be one-dimensional and skewed towards the vanilla extract with the wines still lacking some of the physical benefits that barrel oak imparts. The use of oak powder is also less common than chips, although they are a very practical alternative if oak character is to be introduced during fermentation. Oak planks or staves are sometimes used, either during fermentation or aging. Wines made from these barrel alternatives typically do not age as well as wines that are matured in barrels. Improvements in micro-oxygenation have allowed winemakers to better mimic the gentle aeration of oak barrels in stainless steel tanks with oak chips.|$|E
