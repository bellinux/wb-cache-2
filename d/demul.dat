5000|$|The {{story is}} set in the mid 1970s. Freddy <b>Demul</b> is the {{youngest}} son of a butcher family. Freddy likes road bicycle racing, but this is forbidden by his parents Agnes and Andr√© due to his fecal incontinence. Agnes is afraid her son will be ridiculed when [...] "the problem" [...] turns up in public, causing such psychological trauma leading Freddy to make some drastic decisions. Agnes knows some children who did self-harm after they were bullied such as the singer with a tumor who never sang anymore and a painter who cut off his tongue as he stuttered. That's why Freddy might not leave the house, although he sneakily goes out sometimes.|$|E
