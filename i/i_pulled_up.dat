25|$|When Boelcke {{suddenly}} emerged a few metres on {{the right}} from me, his machine ducked, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> hard, however nevertheless we still touched...me, only {{one side of the}} undercarriage had torn away, him, the outermost piece of the left wing....violent gusts caused his machine to gradually descend more steeply, and I...saw it impact beside a battery position....My attempts to land beside my friend were made impossible because of the shell craters and trenches. Thus I flew rapidly to our field....|$|E
25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hold on!" [...] Daylight cried. [...] "Bettles's right, and I want in on this. I bet {{five hundred}} that sixty {{days from now}} <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> at the Tivoli door with the Dyea mail." ...|$|R
60|$|But to thy alarm be it spoken, Alan, we did {{not come}} {{so far as the}} frying of our fish without further adventure. So it is only to spare thy patience, and mine own eyes, that <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> for the present, and send thee the rest of my story in a {{subsequent}} letter.|$|R
60|$|Just as I reached him, {{he sat up}} and barked at me. I {{was never}} so taken aback in my life. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> short and stared at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "We had a boat-hook, and <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> to the island; I did, mother, and I made {{fast the}} boat to a little stick, and {{we went out to}} explore the island." ...|$|E
60|$|The avenue-gate was open. I dashed in. The {{laboratory}} was {{not visible}} from that point, {{being at the}} back of the house. At the front door <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up,</b> sprang to the ground, let the horse go, and ran forward.|$|E

5000|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "I Get It In" [...] was {{released}} on November 9, 2009. Omarion revealed that it is dedicated to Michael Jackson. Talking about the video, he said, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up,</b> I’m getting out the car, we start choreography and then it keeps going {{until the end of}} the video. I’m telling you right now, this is probably one of the dopest videos you’ve seen in a long time because it’s a concept".|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> my pony {{and stared}} at her, feeling very shy and {{not knowing what to}} say. For a while she stared back at me, being afflicted, presumably, with the same complaint, then spoke with an effort, in a voice that was very soft and pleasant.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a sure thing," [...] Walthew agreed. [...] "However, I guess I {{know what}} you mean. When <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> I fancied your friends were {{watching}} for me, and I'd have found the road blocked if I'd gone on. Don't you think you had better tell me what it's all about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} they don't extend it to----" [...] <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> on the word. He had the upper hand, but I {{could at least}} play the game out with decency. [...] "Come," [...] said I, [...] "contre-danse will begin presently. Find {{yourself}} a partner, and I promise you shall be our vis-à-vis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I slept, but was anew {{awakened by}} a ghastly feeling that the blanket was being dragged and {{creeping}} off the bed. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> it <b>up</b> again, but anew began the slow movement of descent.|$|R
6000|$|She {{must have}} gone to Wales, then. I had her own {{authority}} for saying so.... And yet--Wales? Wales? <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> myself <b>up</b> with a jerk. In that case, how did she come to be passing by Basingstoke? ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2007 interview, Tommy Martin praised Jackson's three-octave {{voice and}} {{revealed}} that he had “remixed {{a couple of those}} songs and in some places where she was weak, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> it <b>up</b> stronger. The duet is now so full and so good.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{wished to}} know. And because I wished {{to ask you}} {{something}} else. You have been brought up in a city, and I have always lived here in the country, except the two years I was out with the army. Do you think I should succeed if <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> here, and settled in Boston?" ...|$|E
6000|$|What Queeker knew {{he never}} explained. It {{may have had}} {{reference}} to certain suspicions entertained {{in regard to the}} impression made by the young student on Katie the night of their first meeting; we cannot tell, but we know that he followed up the exclamation with the muttered remark, [...] "It was fortunate that <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> in time." ...|$|E
6000|$|No, {{they did}} not [...] "sabbe," [...] {{or at least they}} shook their heads to that effect, though they chattered most comprehendingly to one another in their own lingo. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> three or four of the bottom boards, got a couple of buckets from a locker, and by unmistakable sign-language invited them to fall to. But they laughed, and some crowded into the cabin and some climbed up on top.|$|E

60|$|ISABEL. I don't quite know--they were so far off. But {{this one}} was, oh, so big! {{and it had}} great wings, as wide as--twice over the ceiling. So, when it was picking up Sindbad, Florrie and I thought it wouldn't know if we got on its back too: so I got up first, and then <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> Florrie, and we put our arms round its neck, and away it flew.|$|E
60|$|My road lay through Shepton Mallet, Piper's Inn, Bridgewater, and North Petherton, until in {{the cool}} of the evening <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> my weary horse at the Cross Hands, and saw the towers of Taunton in the valley beneath me. A flagon of beer for the rider, and a sieveful of oats for the steed, put fresh mettle into both of us, and we were jogging on our way once more, when there came {{galloping}} {{down the side of the}} hill about forty cavaliers, as hard as their horses could carry them. So wild was their riding that <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up,</b> uncertain whether they were friend or foe, until, as they came whirling towards me, I recognised that the two officers who rode in front of them were none other than Reuben Lockarby and Sir Gervas Jerome. At the sight of me they flung up their hands, and Reuben shot on to his horse's neck, where he sat for a moment astride of the mane, until the brute tossed him back into the saddle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I ran {{on and on}} blindly now, passing all {{the shops}} and coming to {{a part of the}} road where there was a long grey row of private houses. I had, I know not why, an irrational feeling that I was a long iron bridge in empty space. An impulse seized me, and <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> the iron trap of a coal-hole. Looking down through it I saw empty space and the stairs.|$|E
5000|$|... "On Sight" [...] {{contains}} a line stating: [...] "A monster {{about to come}} alive again / Soon as <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> and park the Benz / We get this bitch shaking like Parkinson's." [...] This line aroused controversy from the American Parkinson Disease Association. The group called the verse [...] "distasteful and the product of obvious ignorance." [...] MTV replied stating: [...] "The self-professed 'black new wave artist' {{is no stranger to}} controversial lyrics, drawing the ire of PETA for saying that his 'mink is draggin' on the floor' on last year's [...] "Cold", but APDA's outrage seems perfunctory considering that this isn't the first time a rapper has used the symptoms of Parkinson's disease for lyrical effect." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> him <b>up</b> {{with her}} and laid him out on the raft. A very faint breeze from the {{south-west}} had sprung up; that and a strong seaward current that sets round the rocks were carrying us straight out from the Breton coast and all chance of rescue, towards the open channel.|$|R

60|$|So! It {{had only}} been a dream. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> the blind and looked {{out of the window}} and there was the good old city, with the bright sun {{sparkling}} on its church spires and on the bay spread out at its feet. It looked quite unchanged: just the same pleasant old place, as cheerful, as self-conceited, as kindly, as hospitable, as quarrelsome, as wholesome, as moral and as loyal and as disagreeable as it always was.|$|E
60|$|Mike was by {{this time}} leading me towards an animal. We got within three hundred yards when it began to stretch out. Further pursuit being useless, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up,</b> leaped off, kneeled, fired, and missed again--the ball, {{although}} straight, falling short. With wild haste I scrambled on Rob Roy--who, by the way, stood as still as a stone when left with the bridle thrown {{over his head and}} hanging from his nose. The horses were trained to this.|$|E
60|$|The day {{of which}} I have spoken a storm had set in, the rain falling in sheets. I {{had been in}} the saddle since breakfast, seeing to an hundred repairs that had to be made before the cold weather. 'Twas near the middle of the {{afternoon}} when <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> before the weaving house. The looms were still, and Patty met me at the door with a grave look, which I knew portended something. But her first words were of my comfort.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{crowd of}} girls about us, and <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> myself <b>up</b> and looked among them like a Bashaw. They were all dressed out {{for the sake of}} the ship being in; and the women of Falesá are a {{handsome}} lot to see. If they have a fault, they are a trifle broad in the beam; and I was just thinking so when Case touched me.|$|R
6000|$|... “The old {{man said}} with {{extraordinary}} fervour, ‘Oh, yes <b>I</b> will,’ <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> his horse and they went on. She {{told me that she}} could feel her heart-beats for a long time. The remote power of that voice, those old eyes full of tears, that noble and ruined face, had affected her extraordinarily she said. But perhaps what affected her was the shadow, the still living shadow of a great passion in the man’s heart.|$|R
60|$|When he had spoken, Mina's long {{spell of}} silence {{made me look}} at her. She had fallen back on her pillow asleep. She did not even wake when <b>I</b> had <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> the blind and let in the {{sunlight}} which flooded the room. Van Helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.|$|R
