Since carbohydrates {{have a very high}} calorie count (saccharides have many bonds, therefore much energy), they are desirable to the human body, which evolved to seek out the highest calorie intake foods. They are used as <b>direct</b> <b>energy</b> (sugars) and storage of energy (glycogen). However, there are many non-carbohydrate molecules that trigger a sweet response, leading to the development of many artificial sweeteners, including saccharin, sucralose, and aspartame.

Surgery directly affects nutritional status if a procedure permanently alters the digestive system. Enteral nutrition (tube feeding) is often needed. However a policy of 'nil by mouth' for all gastrointestinal surgery has not been shown to benefit, with some suggestion it might hinder recovery.|$|E

25|$|The second easiest {{reaction}} is to fuse deuterium with itself. Because of its low cost, deuterium {{is commonly used}} by Fusor amateurs. Bussard's polywell experiments were performed using this fuel. Fusion of deuterium or tritium produces a fast neutron, and therefore produces radioactive waste. Bussard's choice was to fuse boron-11 with protons; this {{reaction is}} aneutronic (does not produce neutrons). An advantage of p-11B as a fusion fuel is that the primary reactor output would be energetic alpha particles, which can be directly converted to electricity at high efficiency using <b>direct</b> <b>energy</b> conversion. Direct conversion has achieved a 48% power efficiency against 80–90% theoretical efficiency.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that energy may be extracted from polywells using heat capture or, {{in the case of}} aneutronic fusion like D-3He or p-11B, <b>direct</b> <b>energy</b> conversion, though that scheme faces challenges. The energetic alpha particles (up to a few MeV) generated by the aneutronic fusion reaction would exit the MaGrid through the six axial cusps as cones (spread ion beams). Direct conversion collectors inside the vacuum chamber would convert the alpha particle's kinetic energy to a high-voltage direct current. The alpha particles must slow down before they contact the collector plates to realize high conversion efficiency. In experiments, direct conversion has demonstrated a conversion efficiency of 48%.|$|E

25|$|Electrostatic direct {{conversion}} uses charged particles’ motion to create voltage. This voltage drives electricity in a wire. This becomes electrical power, {{the reverse of}} most phenomena that use a voltage to put a particle in motion. <b>Direct</b> <b>energy</b> conversion does the opposite. It uses a particle's motion to produce a voltage. It {{has been described as}} a linear accelerator running backwards. An early supporter of this method was Richard F. Post at Lawrence Livermore. He proposed to capture the kinetic energy of charged particles as they were exhausted from a fusion reactor and convert this into voltage to drive current in a wire. Post helped develop the theoretical underpinnings of {{direct conversion}}, which was later demonstrated by Barr and Moir. They demonstrated a 48 percent energy capture efficiency on the Tandem Mirror Experiment in 1981.|$|E
25|$|Charged {{particles}} such as {{protons and}} boron, carbon, and neon ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET (linear energy transfer) {{and have an}} antitumor effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via <b>direct</b> <b>energy</b> transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue—the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the Bragg peak effect. See proton therapy for {{a good example of}} the different effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. charged particle therapy. This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRT's use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of secondary cancer induction. This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs makes any stray ionization very damaging (example: head and neck cancers).|$|E

40|$|Recently Flach et. al. used a {{symmetry}} {{analysis to}} predict the appearance of <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> current in homogeneously spatially extended systems coupled to a heat bath {{in the presence of}} an external ac field E(t). The systems are described by nonlinear field equations. Their symmetry analysis allowed them to make the right choice of E(t) so as to obtain symmetry breaking which causes <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> transport for systems with a nonzero topological charge. Their numerical simulations verified the existence of the <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> current. We use a rigorous collective variable for nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations to prove the rectification of the current is due to the excitation of an internal mode, Γ(t), which describes the oscillation of the slope of the kink. The internal mode Γ(t) is excited by its interaction with the center of mass of the kink, X(t), which is accelerated by E(t). The external field E(t) also causes the kink to be dressed, which affects the shape of the kink and modulates the interaction of Γ(t) with X(t). However, we show that the dressing in the absence of excitation of the internal mode Γ(t) cannot cause a <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> current. We derive the expressions for the dressing and numerically solve the equations of motion for Γ(t), X(t), and the momentum, P(t), which enable us to obtain the explicit expressions for the <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> current and the ac driven kink profile. We then show the <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> current vanishes unless the slope Γ(t) is a dynamical variable. ...|$|R

6000|$|People {{suppose a}} family to be royal because it reigns; on the contrary, it reigns because it is royal, because it has more life, plus d'esprit royal--surely as mysterious and occult a force as the virtus dormitiva of opium. The common life of man is about thirty years; the average {{duration}} of the reigns of European sovereigns, being Christian, {{is at the very}} lowest calculation twenty. How is it possible that 'lives should be only thirty years, and reigns from twenty-two to twenty-five, if princes had not more common life than other men?' Mark again, the influence of religion in the duration of sovereignties. All the Christian reigns are longer than all the non-Christian reigns, ancient and modern, and Catholic reigns have been longer than Protestant reigns. The reigns in England, which averaged more than twenty-three years before the Reformation, have only been seventeen years since that, and those of Sweden, which were twenty-two, have fallen to the same figure of seventeen. Denmark, however, for some unknown cause {{does not appear to have}} undergone this law of abbreviation; so, says De Maistre with rather unwonted restraint, let us abstain from generalising. As a matter of fact, however, the generalisation was complete in his own mind, and there was nothing inconsistent with his view of the government of the universe in the fact that a Catholic prince should live longer than a Protestant; indeed such a fact was the natural condition of his view being true. Many differences among the people who hold to the theological interpretation of the circumstances of life arise from the different degrees of activity which they variously attribute to the intervention of God, from those who explain the fall of a sparrow to the ground by a special and <b>direct</b> <b>energy</b> of the divine will, up to those at the opposite end of the scale, who think that direct participation ended when the universe was once fairly launched. De Maistre was of those who see the divine hand on every side and at all times. If, then, Protestantism was a pernicious rebellion against the faith which God had provided for the comfort and salvation of men, why should not God be likely to visit princes, as offenders with the least excuse for their backslidings, with the curse of shortness of days? ...|$|E
