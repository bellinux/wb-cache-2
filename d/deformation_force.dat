40|$|Abstract. The paper aims the {{determination}} of the friction force by means of external friction stress, at the severe plastic deformation processing using cyclic closed-die forging method. It is known that the total force used at the severe plastic deformation by the method of multiaxial forging is being composed by the <b>deformation</b> <b>force</b> itself and the friction force between the semi-product and the deformation tools. Once the friction stresses known, for a certain material, one can determine the friction force corresponding for a given deformation of a semi-product of a particular shape and sizes. By means of the flowing curve of the semi-product material one can determine the <b>deformation</b> <b>force,</b> which together with the friction force give the total necessary force for a deformation and so one can choose the necessary equipment for the processing of the material by severe plastic deformation. For this purpose it has been severely plastic deformed by the method of multiaxial forging, a semi-product having the sizes 10 x 10 x 20 mm, the finished part having the same sizes and shape.

The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} if a smaller morse taper abutment has a negative effect on the fracture resistance of implant-abutment connections under oblique compressive loads compared to a conventional abutment MATERIALS AND METHODS. Twenty morse taper conventional abutments (4. 8 mm diameter) and smaller abutments (3. 8 mm diameter) were tightened (20 Ncm) to their respective implants (3. 5 x 11 mm) and after a 10 minute interval, implant/abutment assemblies were subjected to static compressive test, performed in a universal test machine with 1 mm/min displacement, at 45 degrees inclination. The maximum <b>deformation</b> <b>force</b> was determined. Data were statistically analyzed by student t test. RESULTS. Maximum <b>deformation</b> <b>force</b> of 4. 8 mm and 3. 8 mm abutments was approximately 95. 33 kgf and 95. 25 kgf, respectively, but no fractures were noted after mechanical test.

The results show that Continuous Variable Cross-section Recycled Extrusion is a better method for obtaining TC 4 alloy with fine and equiaxed microstructure. With the increase of extrusion loops from 3 to 6, the grain size decreases and its size are about 2 to 3 um. As the extrusion loops increases from 6 to 8, the grain size {{is similar to that}} of the 6 loops. However, the grain size increases slightly due to multiple heating as the extrusion loops increases from 8 to 12.

The numerical simulations were conducted using the finite element code of LS-DYNA. The effect of fin wall imperfection was assessed through the fin wall bending and bulging. The numerical homogenization of the single layer corrugated structure was performed using MAT 26 honeycomb material model. The buckling stress of single- and double-layer corrugated sandwich structures increased when the strain rate increased. The increased buckling stresses were ascribed to the micro inertial effects. The initial buckling stress at quasi-static and high strain rate was numerically shown to be imperfection sensitive. Increasing the number of core layers decreased the buckling stress and increased the densification strain. The panels tested with spherical and flat striker tips were not penetrated and experienced slightly higher <b>deformation</b> <b>forces</b> and energy absorptions in 0 °/ 90 ° corrugated layer orientation than in 0 °/ 0 ° orientation.
