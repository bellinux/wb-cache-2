50|$|When roots grows {{across the}} plane of {{potential}} failure there {{is an increase in}} shear strength by binding particles. The roots anchor the unstable surficial soil into the <b>deeper</b> <b>stable</b> layers or bedrock. This most readily occurs when there is rapid deep growth (1.5m deep) of roots which last for more than two years.

50|$|A current {{concern in}} the nuclear power field is the safe {{disposal}} and isolation of either spent fuel from reactors or, if the reprocessing option is used, wastes from reprocessing plants. These materials must be isolated from the biosphere until the radioactivity contained in them has diminished to a safe level. In the U.S., under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 as amended, the Department of Energy has responsibility {{for the development of}} the waste disposal system for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. Current plans call for the ultimate disposal of the wastes in solid form in a licensed <b>deep,</b> <b>stable</b> geologic structure called a deep geological repository. The Department of Energy chose Yucca Mountain as the location for the repository. However, its opening has been repeatedly delayed. Since 1999 thousands of nuclear waste shipments have been stored at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico.|$|E

40|$|Nighttime cyclic tornadic supercells {{occurred}} in northern Kansas on both 29 May and 11 June of 2008, the latter event resulting in two fatalities. The supercells produced significant tornadoes within environments containing unusually large near-surface CIN. The synoptic scale and mesoscale evolution of each event is examined, {{with an emphasis}} on the thermodynamic and vertical shear characteristics of the near-storm environment. It is hypothesized that anomalously strong CAPE-shear combinations in each case contributed to the generation of long-lived supercells with intense vertical pressure gradients, allowing the storms to produce tornadoes in environments characterized by a <b>deep</b> <b>stable</b> near-surface layer. _______________ 1...|$|E

Culture is the underlying assumptions of each individual and group; never can these instruments like questionnaires or surveys determine its identity. However, identifying cultural assumptions at a certain level can facilitate the process of cultural assessment. Moreover, it is believed that understanding the process can also be a preparation for each individual to evolve or change culture even.|$|E
40|$|Radioactivity {{in nuclear}} power {{effluents}} is negligible {{compared to that}} in retained wastes to be disposed of as solids. Two basic waste categories are those for which shallow disposal is accepted and those for which more extreme isolation is desired. The latter includes "high level" wastes and others contaminated with radionuclides with the unusual combined properties of long radioactive half-life and high specific radiotoxicity. The favored method for extreme isolation is emplacement in a <b>deep</b> <b>stable</b> geologic formation. Necessary technologies for waste treatment and disposal are considered available. The present program to implement these technologies is discussed, including the waste management significance of current policy on spent nuclear fuel reprocessing.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new and simple method of p-aminohip-puric acid determination by use of dimethylaminocinnamal-dehyde (DACA).

We have used this method successfully to determine effective renal plasma flow in a clinical study of this variable in pregnant women. The clearance ofp-aminohippuric acid (PAH) continues {{to be used to}} measure “effective ” renal plasma flow in research settings. Current methodology for this analyte involves reacting the specimen with a chromogenic aldehyde, di-methylaminocinnamaldehyde (DACA), in dilute acid (1).

40|$|Machine {{tool chatter}} causes {{machining}} instability, surface roughness, and tool wear in metal cutting processes. A stability lobe diagram based on regenerative chatter theory {{is an effective}} tool to predict and control chatter. Stability diagrams can be applied in machining processes to optimize the maximum depth of cut at the highest available spindle speed, thus improving the material removal rate and increasing productivity. A stability lobe diagram is formed {{by a series of}} intersected scallop-shaped borderlines of stability. The intersections of the lobes denote the <b>deepest</b> <b>stable</b> cuts at various ranges of spindle speed. These optimum depths of cut have traditionally been found by graphical solution from the stability lobe diagram. The creation of a stability lobe diagram requires lengthy procedures and calculations. Furthermore, discussion of the topic in manufacturing textbooks is still limited. This paper presents a simple method to analytically calculate the approximate optimum depths of cut and determine the corresponding spindle speeds. This method allows machine operators to practically choose cutting parameters, instructors to effectively teach the regenerative chatter theory, and students to easily create stability lobe diagrams and practice optimizing cutting parameters. A procedure is also introduced to use a spreadsheet to analyze machining parameters and construct stability lobe diagrams. The characteristics and limitations of the stability lobe diagram are discussed. Case studies are also provided to illustrate the method and verify the results...|$|R
40|$|Sour ’ {{environments in}} oil and gas {{recovery}} operations can severely limit the types of materials available for down-hole applications. Sulfide Stress Cracking (SSC), Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) and Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) can prevent the use of common high strength steel alloys. The current method to mitigate cracking is to use more expensive alloys with increased corrosion resistance. Low plasticity burnishing (LPB) provides a different approach. By introducing a <b>deep,</b> <b>stable</b> layer of compressive residual stress, LPB {{has been shown to}} eliminate SSC in high strength steels, providing a cost-effective solution to the problem. As more deep wells and offshore resources are developed, it is important {{to find new ways to}} mitigate corrosion related cracking. LPB offers unprecedented control of residual stresses providing superior protection for a fraction of the cost of new alloys...|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} banded wind {{structure of}} Jupiter and Saturn remains an outstanding problem in planetary fluid dynamics. Both planets exhibit super-rotational equatorial jets (exceeding the underlying {{rotation of the}} magnetic fields tied to their deep fluid interiors), with speeds of some 100 and 400 m/s, respectively, and counter-flowing lots at higher latitudes;. Recent analyses of the 1995 Galileo probe measurements, Hubble Telescope observations of the 1994 Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet crash, and Earth-based infrared mapping provide evidence for a variably stratified, deeply seated flow layer. A now conceptual model for the jovian current system is proposed, in some ways resembling the oceanic thermocline, assuming a mixed distribution of potential vorticity atop a tropospheric wind layer of latitudinally variable stratification. A simple analytic version of the model links the strength, shape, {{and direction of the}} alternating zonal currents on Jupiter and Saturn to a single parameter equivalent to the internal deformation scale for an inferred <b>deep</b> <b>stable</b> region...|$|E
40|$|Chatter {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{limitations}} in milling operations causing poor quality and reduced productivity. Stability diagrams can be used to identify <b>deep</b> <b>stable</b> pockets which usually occur at high spindle speeds. However, the required high cutting speeds may not be applied in some cases due to machinability ormachine tool limitations. It is known that variable pitch and helix tools help suppressing chatter even atlow cutting speeds. These tools may offer high productivity if they are properly designed. The literatureon variable geometry milling tools is mainly limited to modelling and simulation whereas for industrialapplications design guidelines are needed for selection of variation pattern and amount which is thefocus of this paper. Dynamics and stability of variable pitch and helix tools are modelled and solved infrequency domain as well as using Semi-Discretization Method employing multiple delays. A practical butaccurate design method is presented for selection of the best variation combination to maximize chatterfree material removal rate without using time consuming computer simulations. Increased stability withthe tools designed using the proposed method is demonstrated by several examples which are verified experimentally...|$|E

40|$|One {{option for}} {{disposing}} of excess weapons plutonium {{is to place}} it near the base of <b>deep</b> boreholes in <b>stable</b> crystalline rocks. The technology exists to immediately begin the design of this means of disposition {{and there are many}} attractive sites available within the conterminous US. The borehole system utilizes mainly natural barriers to preven migration of Pu and U to the Earth`s surface. Careful site selection ensures favorable geologic conditions that provide natural long-lived migration barriers; they include <b>deep,</b> extremely <b>stable</b> rock formations, strongly reducing brines that exhibit increasing salinity with depth, and most importantly, demonstrated isolation or non-communication of deep fluids with the biosphere for millions of years. This isolation is the most important characteristic, with the other conditions mainly being those that will enhance the potential of locating and maintaining the isolated zones. Candidate sites will probably be located on the craton in very old Precambrian crystalline rocks, most likely the center of a granitic pluton. The sites will be located in tectonically stable areas with no recent volcanic or seismic activity, and situated away from tectonic features that might become active in the near geologic future...|$|R
