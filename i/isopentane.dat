The Wairakei power station {{has been running}} much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW <b>isopentane</b> systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.|$|E

25|$|In organic chemistry, Carnelley's Rule, {{established}} in 1882 by Thomas Carnelley, states that high molecular symmetry {{is associated with}} high melting point. Carnelley based his rule on examination of 15,000 chemical compounds. For example, for three structural isomers with molecular formula C5H12 the melting point increases in the series <b>isopentane</b> −160°C (113 K) n-pentane −129.8°C (143 K) and neopentane −16.4°C (256.8 K). Likewise in xylenes and also dichlorobenzenes the melting point increases in the order meta, ortho and then para. Pyridine has a lower symmetry than benzene hence its lower melting point but the melting point again increases with diazine and triazines. Many cage-like compounds like adamantane and cubane with high symmetry have relatively high melting points.|$|E

50|$|<b>Isopentane,</b> C5H12, {{also called}} {{methylbutane}} or 2-methylbutane, is a branched-chain alkane with five carbon atoms. <b>Isopentane</b> {{is an extremely}} volatile and extremely flammable liquid at room temperature and pressure.

50|$|The {{melting point}} of {{neopentane}} (−16.6 °C), {{on the other}} hand, is 140 degrees {{higher than that of}} <b>isopentane</b> (−159.9 °C) and 110 degrees higher than that of n-pentane (−129.8 °C). This anomaly has been attributed to the better solid-state packing assumed to be possible with the tetrahedral neopentane molecule; but this explanation has been challenged on account of it having a lower density than the other two isomers. Moreover, its enthalpy of fusion is lower than the enthalpies of fusion of both n-pentane and <b>isopentane,</b> thus indicating that its high melting point is due to an entropy effect resulting from higher molecular symmetry. Indeed, the entropy of fusion of neopentane is about 4 times lower than that of n-pentane and <b>isopentane.</b>|$|E

50|$|The same {{tends to}} be true for the melting points of alkane isomers, and that of <b>isopentane</b> is 30 °C {{lower than that of}} n-pentane. However, the melting point of neopentane, the most heavily {{branched}} of the three, is 100 °C higher than that of <b>isopentane.</b> The anomalously high melting point of neopentane has been attributed to the tetrahedral molecules packing more closely in solid form.

5000|$|In March 2010, SGO was in {{the news}} due to a freak {{accident}} when a factory worker set off a brief, isolated, but violent explosion, when a highly flammable liquid, <b>isopentane,</b> escaped while he was filling a solvent distillation unit.

50|$|The {{boiling point}} of {{neopentane}} is only 9.5 °C, {{significantly lower than}} those of <b>isopentane</b> (27.7 °C) and normal pentane (36.0 °C). Therefore, neopentane is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, while the other two isomers are (barely) liquids.|$|E

50|$|Pentane is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C5H12—that is, an alkane with five carbon atoms.

The bubble/foam-making process is irreversible and endothermic, i.e. it needs heat (e.g. from a melt process or the chemical exotherm due to cross-linking), to volatilize a liquid blowing agent. However, on cooling the blowing agent will condense, i.e. a reversible process.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies have}} used {{interesting}} comparisons {{in order to}} probe the energetic stability of the 2-norbornyl cation provided by its delocalized nature. Comparing the rearrangement between the 3-methyl-2-norbornyl cation and the 2-methyl-2-norbornyl cation to that between the tertiary and secondary <b>isopentane</b> carbocations, one finds that the change in enthalpy is about 6 kcal/mol less for the norbornyl system. Since the major {{difference between these two}} reversible rearrangements is the amount of delocalization possible in the electronic ground state, one can attribute the stabilization of the 3-methyl-2-norbornyl cation to its non-classical nature. However, some experimental studies failed to observe this stabilization in solvolysis reactions.|$|E
