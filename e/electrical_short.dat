The most vulnerable components are the mechanical components, such as cooling fans, cd drives, keyboard, mice and touch pads.

Moist ash may cause <b>electrical</b> <b>short</b> circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s {{because of}} a potential safety problem. An <b>electrical</b> <b>short,</b> it was discovered, could melt a small hole in the casing, which occurred {{in three of the}} 60,000 notebooks manufactured between October 1991 and March 1992. On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the motherboard; and the computer was prone to cracks in the power adapter socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if the warranty had expired.|$|E
40|$|Multifunctional {{composites}} {{that have}} the ability to store or generate energy have attracted huge attention recently. One type of multifunctional composite is a structural capacitor that uses car-bon fiber cloth as electrodes separated by glass-fiber cloth. However, such structural capacitors are difficult to fabricate reliably because <b>electrical</b> <b>shorts</b> sometimes form between the electrodes. In the present study, we investigate the mechanism of <b>electrical</b> <b>shorting</b> in such capacitors, which allows us to propose an improved fabrication process to prevent <b>electrical</b> <b>shorting</b> between the carbon-cloth electrodes. Infrared thermography reveals that <b>electrical</b> <b>shorting</b> between the elec-trodes is caused by contact between the carbon-fiber electrodes. Such contacts are formed by movement of the glass fibers of the separator during curing, which is induced by epoxy resin flow. Pre-curing of the glass-fiber cloth separator to a suitable degree ensures that the electrical insula-tion between carbon-fiber electrodes is reliable...|$|R

5|$|After {{witnessing}} California-based gang boss Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes {{to death}} in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes {{to be placed in}} the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom, and a man using another bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an <b>electrical</b> <b>short,</b> but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Kim's work {{began to be}} rediscovered by South Korean cult film fans who {{discussed}} his films through the Internet and exchanged hard-to-find copies by videotape. Noticing this growing domestic Kim Ki-young cult, the Dongsung Cinematheque, an art-house theater in Seoul, programmed a retrospective showing of Kim's films. With his profile again high in Korean film society, Kim's work began to attract international attention. Five of his films were screened at the Tokyo International Film Festival in 1996. When Kim Ki-young's career was highlighted at the second Pusan International Film Festival in 1997, his work found enthusiastic new audiences in the international film community. The strongly positive reception of Kim's work by international audiences surprised the festival organizers, who immediately began receiving requests for overseas retrospectives of Kim's career. With this renewed interest, Kim began work on a comeback film to be titled Diabolical Woman. The Berlin International Film Festival invited him to attend a showing of his films in 1998. Before Kim started work on the film or attended the festival, {{he and his wife}} were killed in a house fire caused by an <b>electrical</b> <b>short</b> circuit on February 5, 1998.|$|E
40|$|Metal {{coatings}} especially tin, zinc and cadmium are unpredictably {{susceptible to}} the formation of electrically conductive, crystalline filaments referred to as metal whiskers. The use of such coatings in and around electrical systems presents a risk of <b>electrical</b> <b>shorting.</b> Examples of metal whisker formation are shown with emphasis on optical inspection techniques to improve probability of detection. The failure modes (i. e., <b>electrical</b> <b>shorting</b> behavior) associated with metal whiskers are described.

40|$|Tin {{whiskers}} are conductive crystal growths {{that form}} unpredictively from tin and tin alloy surfaces. The growth of tin whiskers presents a reliability concern in electronic equipment {{due to their}} potential to create <b>electrical</b> <b>shorts</b> and metal vapor arcs. Concern with tin whiskers is increasing due to the ever tightening conductor spacing in smaller electronic products and {{the increased use of}} pure tin and lead-free tin alloys. While tin whiskers present a failure risk for electronics, a tin whisker mechanical bridging between two differently electrically biased conductors doesn't guaranteed <b>electrical</b> <b>shorts</b> due to surface films on tin whisker and conductors. The voltage must exceed a threshold level in order to produce the current flow through the tin whisker. However, the influence of contact force and presence of surface contaminations on breakdown voltage of tin whiskers has not been adequately investigated. Furthermore, whisker-induced <b>electrical</b> <b>shorts</b> can initiate destructive metal vapor arcs. The potential for metal vapor arc formation is affected by several factors, including whisker geometry, bias voltage and pressure. Previous studies demonstrated metal vapor arc formation using gold- and tin-wires; however, material and geometry differences between these test articles and actual tin whiskers have not been examined. Further, a practical guide for assessing the potential for tin whisker-induced metal vapor arc formation has not been provided. This dissertation provides characteristics and assessment of tin whisker-induced <b>electrical</b> <b>shorts</b> and metal vapor arcs. The breakdown voltage of tin whisker was measured using gold- and tin-coated probes to characterize the influence of two different contact materials on breakdown voltage. As a part of this effort, the effect of contact force on breakdown voltage and its current-voltage characteristics related with the failure mode and the possibility of <b>electrical</b> <b>shorting</b> by tin whiskers were also investigated. With regards to tin whisker-induced metal vapor arc formation, the effect of whisker geometry, bias voltage and pressure was investigated. Based on the experimental evidence, a metric defined as a function of bias voltage and resistance was proposed and the logistic regression model that can assess the likelihood of tin whisker-induced metal vapor arc formation was developed...|$|R

5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an <b>electrical</b> <b>short</b> somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} {{tungsten}} light bulb filaments attempts to reduce creep deformation. Sagging of the filament coil between its supports increases with time {{due to the}} weight of the filament itself.
