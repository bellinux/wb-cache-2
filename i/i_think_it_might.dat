500|$|At {{the end of}} his {{narrative}} of the Quest expedition, Wild wrote of the Antarctic: [...] "I think that my work there is done"; he never returned, closing a career which, like Shackleton's, had bracketed the entire Heroic Age. In 1923 he emigrated to South Africa where, after a series of business failures and dogged by ill health, he was employed in a succession of low-paid jobs. In March 1939 the British Government awarded him an annual pension of £170; Wild commented: [...] "I don't want to grumble, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been made big enough for the poor old hero and his wife to live on". Wild died on 19 August 1939, aged 66, the cause of death recorded as pneumonia [...] and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
500|$|It was Jones who {{ultimately}} played {{most of the}} bass parts during the Bollocks recordings; Howard calls his rudimentary, rumbling approach the [...] "explosive missing ingredient" [...] of the Sex Pistols' sound. Vicious's bass is reportedly present on one track that appeared on the original album release, [...] "Bodies". Jones recalls, [...] "He played his farty old bass part and we just let him do it. When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid's down low. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be barely audible on the track." [...] Following [...] "God Save the Queen", two more singles were released: [...] "Pretty Vacant" [...] (largely written by Matlock) on 1 July and from the Bollocks sessions, [...] "Holidays in the Sun" [...] on 14 October. Each was a Top Ten hit.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} Hollywood studios had {{contacted}} George R.R. Martin about possible adaptation {{of his book}} series A Song of Ice and Fire into a film, however Martin expressed the opinion the books could not {{be made into a}} film as too much would have to be cut from the books, but thought it could be made into a television series. In January 2006, David Benioff spoke to Martin's literary agent about the books he represented for possible adaption, and the agent sent the first four books of A Song of Ice and Fire to David Benioff. Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first book in the series, A Game of Thrones, called D. B. Weiss and said: [...] "Maybe I'm crazy, but I haven't had this much fun reading anything in about 20 years. So take a look because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> make a great HBO series." [...] Weiss, who then read the first book in two days, was very enthusiastic about a possible television project based on the books. They arranged a meeting with Martin, who asked them if they knew who Jon Snow’s real mother might be, and was satisfied with their answer.|$|E

500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brummell took a {{house on}} Chesterfield Street in Mayfair {{and for a time}} managed to avoid the nightly gaming and other extravagances fashionable in such {{elevated}} circles. [...] Where he refused to economise was on his dress: when asked how much it would cost to keep a single man in clothes, he was said to have replied: [...] "Why, with tolerable economy, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be done with £800." [...] That amount is approximately £52,000 ($67,000) in 2016 currency; the average wage for a craftsman at that time was £52 a year.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2012 {{issue of}} Game Informer, Harlan Ellison, David Sears and David Mullich {{discussed}} {{the process that}} went into developing the game {{as well as the}} character developments and other changes that were made from the original story. For example, in writing the script for Ellen's confrontation with her rapist, Mullich channeled the memory he had of his infant son going through chemotherapy, being with him at the hospital and sharing a room with other young cancer patients. In discussing the characters changes made to Benny, Mullich said, [...] "Looking back, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been a lost opportunity to write a story about someone struggling with the challenges of being homosexual." [...] Although Sears recalls that [...] "gay angle" [...] was in their initial script, but might have subsequently been a dropped thread.|$|E

2500|$|In spring 2009, {{the band}} began {{recording}} material for its third studio album. However, on July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker announced via the band's official website {{that the two}} were leaving the band. In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want}} to do?' and I said, 'Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going to say the same thing,'" [...] Ross recalled. [...] "And there was really no argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." [...] Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie. Urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound, while Ross – and, by extension, Walker – was interested in making retro-inspired rock.|$|E
2500|$|Rhodes quietly {{planned to}} annex some of Mozambique into the Company domain {{so he could}} {{establish}} a major port {{at the mouth of}} the Pungwe River. He thought this might make an ideal sea outlet for his proposed settlement in Mashonaland, the area directly to Matabeleland's north-east where Lobengula held dominion over many Mashona chiefs. Rhodes believed that the Portuguese claim to Mozambique was tenuous enough that he could win much of it without provoking major ire: [...] "the occupation of the Portuguese even along the coast line is in most places merely a paper one," [...] he wrote to Whitehall in late 1889, [...] "and if this has not been recognised by international agreement <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be left open." [...] But contrary to Rhodes's opinion, general consensus at the Berlin Conference of 1884–85 had made Portugal's hold over the Mozambican coastline very secure. The Portuguese had expanded inland during the late 1880s, creating Manicaland in the eastern Mashona country. They founded Beira, a port on Rhodes's proposed Pungwe site, in 1890. Portugal issued the so-called [...] "Pink Map" [...] around this time, laying claim to the very corridor of land between Angola and Mozambique that Rhodes desired. The British government issued a firm ultimatum against the Portuguese claims in January 1890; Lisbon swiftly acquiesced and left the area open for the Company's drive north.|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker {{announced}} via the band's {{official website}} {{that the two}} were leaving the band. The statement, in part, read: [...] "Ryan Ross and Jon Walker will be leaving Panic at the Disco {{to embark on a}} musical excursion of their own. Though the four of us have made music together in the past, we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve. Over the years, we have remained close and honest with each other, which helped us to realize that our goals were different and that parting ways is truly what is best for each of us." [...] In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want to}} do?' and I said, 'Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going to say the same thing,' [...] " [...] Ross recalled.
