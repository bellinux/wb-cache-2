5|$|In early 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913–1994), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish descent. She had {{run away}} from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London's West End. Laying his head <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed {{together}} ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, {{and in the second}} half of 1936 were courting. They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937. In early 1938 they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. Their first child, Llewelyn Edouard, was born on 30 January 1939.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist John F. Campbell noted a {{story told}} on Islay, {{one of the}} Inner Hebridean islands, which {{demonstrates}} the usefulness of having a water bull. Just after a calf was born to an ordinary cow, an elderly lady, later identified as a witch, advised the herdsman to keep it separate from the other cattle, presumably after she noticed its deformed ears and suspected it was a water bull. She instructed the herdsman to rear the calf on milk from three different cows and to keep it confined in a stable {{for a minimum of}} seven years. Years later, a young woman was grazing cattle at a nearby loch when she was approached by an attractive man. He struck up a conversation with her and shortly afterwards the pair sat on the grass with his head resting <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> but as he fell asleep she discovered seaweed entwined in his hair, a sign that he was a water horse. She started to run back to the farm. Her suitor awoke, shapeshifted into his true equine form and chased after her. As the woman ran towards the farm, the witch shouted to the herdsman to release the water bull from the stable. The two creatures fought until they fell into the sea. The water horse never returned, but the remains of the bull were found the following day.|$|E

In her right hand she holds aloft a globe with her thumb and two fingers, while her left hand supports the infant <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> The Christ figure himself wears a pontifical gown and presses a book against his breast with his left hand.|$|E
25|$|Cleaning the Mirror {{consisted}} of five monitors playing footage in which Abramović scrubs a grimy human skeleton <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> She vigorously brushes the {{different parts of}} the skeleton with soapy water. Each monitor is dedicated to one part of the skeleton: the head, the pelvis, the ribs, the hands, and the feet. Each video is filmed with its own sound, creating an overlap. As the skeleton becomes cleaner, Abramović becomes covered in the grayish dirt that was once covering the skeleton. This three-hour performance is filled with metaphors of the Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality. The piece consists of a three-piece series. Cleaning the Mirror #1 was performed at the Museum of Modern Art, consisting of three hours. Cleaning the Mirror #2 consists of 90 minutes performed at Oxford University. Cleaning the Mirror #3 was performed at Pitt Rivers Museum for five hours.|$|E

Sue and Ali rush his lifeless body to local nurse, Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), but Hassan is already dead.

She remains in a trance like state for weeks, refusing to eat, sleep, cry or acknowledge her own grief. She later begins blaming herself unfairly for her son's sudden and unexplainable death.

25|$|The Four Spirits {{sculpture}} {{was unveiled}} at Birmingham's Kelly Ingram Park in September 2013 {{to commemorate the}} 50th anniversary of the bombing. Crafted in Berkeley, California by Birmingham-born sculptor Elizabeth MacQueen and designed as a memorial to the four children killed on September 15, 1963, the bronze and steel life-size sculpture depicts the four girls {{in preparation for the}} church sermon at the 16th Street Baptist Church in the moments immediately before the explosion. The youngest girl killed in the explosion (Carol Denise McNair) is depicted releasing six doves into the air as she stands tiptoed and barefooted upon a bench as another barefooted girl (Addie Mae Collins) is depicted kneeling upon the bench, affixing a dress sash to McNair; a third girl (Cynthia Wesley) is sat upon the bench alongside McNair and Collins with a Bible <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> The fourth girl (Carole Robertson) is depicted standing and smiling as she motions the other three girls to attend their church sermon.|$|E
25|$|Like many medieval {{works of}} art, the Madonna {{displays}} {{a very complex}} iconography. The statue shows the Virgin in a rather plain gown, while the oversized Christ child figure <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> wears a precious pontifical gown. The size is meant to illustrate the importance of Christ as redeemer. In contrast Mary is depicted in a serving role, in accordance with Luke 1:38: And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. At {{the same time she}} embodies the Seat of Wisdom as the Throne of Solomon is described in 1 Kings 10:18: Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. Sitting on her lap is the Christ child, whose ornate chasuble betokens his significance as ruler of the heavens, the book his role as herald of the faith. Bearing in mind other medieval portrayals of Christ as teacher, it may be supposed that the child’s lost right arm was originally raised in a gesture of blessing. However, Christ’s face is turned towards his mother, while from any position Mary’s look seems directed towards the beholder. Thus Mary may arguably not only be interpreted as a passive devotee but also assumes the role of mediator between the people and the Redeemer.|$|E

25|$|Shadaksharadeva, who {{attempted}} to revive the classical (Sanskritised) champu metre, belonged to the Pampa tradition. A Veerashaiva by faith {{and the head of}} the Yelandur monastery, he was under the patronage of the Mysore court. A bilingual writer in Sanskrit and Kannada, his writings propagate his faith in the god Shiva. He wrote three well-known works in Kannada: Rakashekara Vilasa (1655), his best-known poetic work, written during his early days, has love as the main theme and rivals the poems in Lakshmisa's Jaimini Bharata (17th century). It is derived from a well-known devotional Tamil story of Satyendra Chola and is known to be based on an earlier work, Bhavachintaratna (c.1513), by Kannada writer Gubbi Mallanarya of Vijayanagara. In a noteworthy piece of elegiac poetry, the poet describes the lamentation of a mother in his own inimitable style. Upon hearing the news of her son's death by trampling under the hooves of Prince Rajashekara's horse, the mother rushes to the scene, and mourns, holding the body of her son <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> Vrishabhendra Vijaya (1671), a poem of epic proportions, written in forty-two cantos and 4,000 stanzas, is an account of the 12th century reformer Basavanna. Sabarasankara Vilasa is a poem in five cantos narrating a popular tale of the battle between the god Shiva and the Pandava prince Arjuna. To test Arjuna's devotion to him, Shiva disguises himself as a hunter and fights a fierce battle with Arjuna. Toward the end, impressed with Arjuna's devotion, Shiva bestows on him a weapon called Pashuptastra.|$|E
500|$|Shashthi {{is portrayed}} as a motherly figure, often nursing or {{carrying}} {{as many as eight}} infants in her arms. Her complexion is usually depicted as yellow or golden.

Older depictions of Shashthi may show her as cat-faced, while another reference describes her as bird-faced.|$|E

You are a wicked and miserable woman. You have never seen joy before, joy which thrills your whole body and mind with mad delight." [...] Overjoyed and forgetful of her poisoned breasts, she took Krishna <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> and suckled him.

500|$|The {{first draft}} {{libretto}} that Illica produced for Puccini resurfaced in 2000 after being lost for many years. It contains considerable differences {{from the final}} libretto, relatively minor {{in the first two}} acts but much more appreciable in the third, where the description of the Roman dawn that opens the third act is much longer, and Cavaradossi's tragic aria, the eventual [...] "E lucevan le stelle", has different words. The 1896 libretto also offers a different ending, in which Tosca does not die but instead goes mad. In the final scene, she cradles her lover's head <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> and hallucinates that she and her Mario are on a gondola, and that she is asking the gondolier for silence. Sardou refused to consider this change, insisting that as in the play, Tosca must throw herself from the parapet to her death. Puccini agreed with Sardou, telling him that the mad scene would have the audiences anticipate the ending and start moving towards the cloakrooms. Puccini pressed his librettists hard, and Giacosa issued a series of melodramatic threats to abandon the work. The two librettists were finally able to give Puccini what they hoped was a final version of the libretto in 1898.|$|E
500|$|The statue was {{financed by}} a [...] "group of generous Portlanders", and its {{commission}} was {{managed by the}} Regional Arts & Culture Council (RACC) with assistance from members of Katz's former staff. It was unveiled on June 2, 2006, on the plaza {{at the south end}} of the Esplanade, just north of the Hawthorne Bridge and Main Street marker. It measures [...] x [...] x [...] and rests on an orange triangular base. Portland State University's Daily Vanguard described Katz as: [...] "leaning close to a small body with legs crossed and hands in, squeezed together <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> as if she's cold, too. The teeth are also bared and unusually straight, creating the impression that Katz might snap at passers-by. But overall, the face is open and the hair is particularly lifelike." [...] She is depicted wearing a Portland rose on her lapel. According to The Oregonian, the sculpture provides a lap on which children can pose and sometimes frightens passersby at night. It is part of the collection of the Regional Arts & Culture Council. The organization has said: [...] "it seems fitting that [...] political leadership and love for the arts should come together in a public tribute to her".|$|E

Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears {{on the back of}} a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love?" [...] This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pour incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> looking across the factory from her sitting room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers staring up and looking for the source of the voice.|$|E
