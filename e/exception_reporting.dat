40|$|Pay-for-performance {{programs}} are often aimed {{to improve the}} management of chronic diseases. We evaluate {{the impact of a}} local pay for performance programme (QOF+), which rewarded financially more ambitious quality targets (‘stretch targets’) than those used nationally in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). We focus on targets for intermediate outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. A difference-in-difference approach is used to compare practice level achievements before and after the introduction of the local pay for performance program. In addition, we analysed patient-level data on <b>exception</b> <b>reporting</b> and intermediate outcomes utilizing an interrupted time series analysis. The local pay for performance program led to significantly higher target achievements (hypertension: p-value < 0. 001, coronary heart disease: p-values < 0. 001, diabetes: p-values < 0. 061, stroke: p-values < 0. 003). However, the increase was driven by higher rates of <b>exception</b> <b>reporting</b> (hypertension: p-value < 0. 001, coronary heart disease: p-values < 0. 03, diabetes: p-values < 0. 05) in patients with all conditions except for stroke. <b>Exception</b> <b>reporting</b> allows practitioners to exclude patients from target calculations if certain criteria are met, e. g. informed dissent of the patient for treatment. There were no statistically significant improvements in mean blood pressure, cholesterol or HbA 1 c levels. Thus, achievement of higher payment thresholds in the local pay for performance scheme was mainly attributed to increased <b>exception</b> <b>reporting</b> by practices with no discernable improvements in overall clinical quality. Hence, active monitoring of <b>exception</b> <b>reporting</b> should be considered when setting more ambitious quality targets.

40|$|Abstract Background The 2003 {{revision}} of the UK GMS contract rewards general practices for performance against clinical quality indicators. Practices can exempt patients from treatment, and can receive maximum payment for less than full coverage of eligible patients. This paper aims to estimate {{the gap between the}} percentage of maximum incentive gained and the percentage of patients receiving indicated care (the pay-performance gap), and to estimate how much of the gap is attributable respectively to thresholds and to <b>exception</b> <b>reporting.</b> Methods Analysis of Quality Outcomes Framework data in the National Primary Care Database and <b>exception</b> <b>reporting</b> data from the Information Centre from 8407 practices in England in 2005 – 6. The main outcome measures were the gap between the percentage of maximum incentive gained and the percentage of patients receiving indicated care at the practice level, both for individual indicators and a combined composite score. An additional outcome was the percentage of that gap attributable respectively to <b>exception</b> <b>reporting</b> and maximum threshold targets set at less than 100 %. Results The mean pay-performance gap for the 65 aggregated clinical indicators was 13. 3 % (range 2. 9 % to 48 %). 52 % of this gap (6. 9 % of eligible patients) is attributable to thresholds being set at less than 100 %, and 48 % to patients being exception reported. The gap was greater than 25 % in 9 indicators: beta blockers and cholesterol control in heart disease; cholesterol control in stroke; influenza immunization in asthma; blood pressure, sugar and cholesterol control in diabetes; seizures in epilepsy and treatment of hypertension. Conclusion Threshold targets and <b>exception</b> <b>reporting</b> introduce an incentive ceiling, which substantially reduces the percentage of eligible patients that UK practices need to treat in order to receive maximum incentive payments for delivering that care. There are good clinical reasons for <b>exception</b> <b>reporting,</b> but after unsuitable patients have been exempted from treatment, {{there is no reason why}} all maximum thresholds should not be 100 %, whilst retaining the current lower thresholds to provide incentives for lower performing practices. </p...|$|E

40|$|Since 2003, 25 % of UK general practitioners’ {{income has}} been {{determined}} {{by the quality of}} their care. The 65 clinical quality indicators in this scheme (the Quality and Outcomes Framework) are in the form of ratios, with financial reward increasing linearly with the ratio between a lower and upper threshold. The numerator is the number of patients for whom an indicator is achieved and the denominator is the number of patients the practices declare are suitable for the indicator. The number declared suitable is the number of patients with the relevant condition less the number exception reported by the practice for a specified range of reasons. <b>Exception</b> <b>reporting</b> is designed to avoid harmful treatment resulting from the application of quality targets to patients for whom they were not intended. However, <b>exception</b> <b>reporting</b> also gives GPs the opportunity to exclude patients who should in fact be treated in order to achieve higher financial rewards.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The UK's Quality and Outcomes Framework permits {{practices}} to exempt patients from financially-incentivised performance targets. To {{better understand the}} determinants and consequences of being exempted from the framework, we investigated the associations between <b>exception</b> <b>reporting,</b> patient characteristics and mortality. We also quantified the proportion of exempted patients that met quality targets for a tracer condition (diabetes). DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal study, using individual patient data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. SETTING: 644 general practices, 2006 / 7 to 2011 / 12. PARTICIPANTS: Patients registered with study practices {{for at least one}} year over the study period, with at least one condition of interest (2 460 341 in total). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Exception</b> <b>reporting</b> rates by reason (clinical contraindication, patient dissent); all-cause mortality in year following exemption. Analyses with logistic and Cox proportional-hazards regressions, respectively. RESULTS: The odds of being exempted increased with age, deprivation and multimorbidity. Men {{were more likely to be}} exempted but this was largely attributable to higher prevalence of conditions with high exemption rates. Modest associations remained, with women more likely to be exempted due to clinical contraindication (OR 0. 90, 99 % CI 0. 88 to 0. 92) and men more likely to be exempted due to informed dissent (OR 1. 08, 99 % CI 1. 06 to 1. 10). More deprived areas (both for practice location and patient residence) were non-linearly associated with higher exception rates, after controlling for comorbidities and other covariates, with stronger associations for clinical contraindication. Compared with patients with a single condition, odds ratios for patients with two, three, or four or more conditions were respectively 4. 28 (99 % CI 4. 18 to 4. 38), 16. 32 (99 % CI 15. 82 to 16. 83) and 68. 69 (99 % CI 66. 12 to 71. 37) for contraindication, and 2. 68 (99 % CI 2. 63 to 2. 74), 4. 02 (99 % CI 3. 91 to 4. 13) and 5. 17 (99 % CI 5. 00 to 5. 35) for informed dissent. Exempted patients had a higher adjusted risk of death in the following year than non-exempted patients, regardless of whether this exemption was for contraindication (hazard ratio 1. 37, 99 % CI 1. 33 to 1. 40) or for informed dissent (1. 20, 99 % CI 1. 17 to 1. 24). On average, quality standards were met for 48 % of exempted patients in the diabetes domain, but there was wide variation across indicators (ranging from 8 to 80 %). CONCLUSIONS: Older, multimorbid and more deprived patients are more likely to be exempted from the scheme. Exception reported patients are more likely to die in the following year, whether they are exempted by the practice for a contraindication or by themselves through informed dissent.
