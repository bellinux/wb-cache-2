40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Estrogens are {{important}} effectors of reproduction and {{are critical for}} upregulating female reproductive behavior or lordosis in females. In addition {{to the importance of}} transcriptional regulation of genes by 17 beta-estradiol-bound estrogen receptors (ER), extranuclear signal transduction cascades such as protein kinase A (PKA) are also important in regulating female sexual receptivity. GPR 30 (G-protein coupled receptor 30), also known as GPER 1, a putative membrane ER (mER), is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds 17 beta-estradiol with an affinity that is similar to that possessed by the classical nuclear ER and activates both PKA and extracellular-regulated kinase signaling pathways. The high expression of GPR 30 in the ventromedial hypothalamus, a region important for lordosis behavior as well as kinase cascades activated by this receptor, led us to hypothesize that GPR 30 may regulate lordosis behavior in female rodents. METHOD: In this study, we investigated the ability of G- 1, a selective agonist of GPR 30, to regulate lordosis in the female mouse by administering this agent prior to progesterone in an estradiol-progesterone priming paradigm prior to testing with stud males. RESULTS: As expected, 17 beta-estradiol benzoate (EB), but not sesame oil, <b>increased</b> <b>lordosis</b> behavior in female mice. G- 1 also <b>increased</b> <b>lordosis</b> behavior in female mice and decreased the number of rejective responses towards male mice, similar to the effect of EB. The selective GPR 30 antagonist G- 15 blocked these effects. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that activation of the mER GPR 30 stimulates social behavior in a rodent model {{in a manner similar to}} EB...|$|E

30|$|The {{evaluations}} of physiological and biomechanical elements showed that for each considered parameter, {{there are significant}} and meaningful differences depending on supine or upright position and sometimes even on gender; careful analysis of an MRI should therefore be performed according to these data when interpreting subsequent pathological findings. Reduced lumbosacral and <b>increased</b> <b>lordosis</b> angle depend on activation of postural effects of body weight mediated by abdominal and paraspinal muscles. In standing position, the lumbosacral angle decreases in relation to verticality of the spine, which is necessary to support the increase in weight, whereas the increase in lordosis angle reflects compensation by muscle contracture. The reduction of intervertebral disc height was highly significant (p =  0.000083), undoubtedly due to body weight and muscle activation [11, 14, 17]. In particular, the reduction of disc height affects the posterior portion, whereas anteriorly, {{there was a slight}} increase, with major changes at L 2 –L 3 and L 3 –L 4 [18].|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Both {{anterior}} cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF) and anterior cervical corpectomy with fusion (ACCF) {{are used}} to treat cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), however, there is considerable controversy as to whether ACDF or ACCF is the optimal treatment for this condition. To compare the clinical outcomes, complications, and surgical trauma between ACDF and ACCF {{for the treatment of}} CSM, we conducted a meta-analysis. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane databases, searching for relevant controlled trials up to July 2013 that compared ACDF and ACCF for the treatment of CSM. We performed title and abstract screening and full-text screening independently and in duplicate. A random effects model was used for heterogeneous data; otherwise, a fixed effect model was used to pool data, using mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2157 citations examined, 15 articles representing 1372 participants were eligible. Overall, there were {{significant differences between the two}} treatment groups for hospital stay (M = - 5. 60, 95 % CI = - 7. 09 to - 4. 11), blood loss (MD = - 151. 35, 95 % CI = - 253. 22 to - 49. 48), complications (OR = 0. 50, 95 % CI = 0. 35 to 0. 73) and <b>increased</b> <b>lordosis</b> of C 2 -C 7 (MD = 3. 70, 95 % CI = 0. 96 to 6. 45) and fusion segments angles (MD = 3. 38, 95 % CI = 2. 54 to 4. 22). However, there were no significant differences in the operation time (MD = - 9. 34, 95 % CI = - 42. 99 to 24. 31), JOA (MD = 0. 24, 95 % CI = - 0. 10 to 0. 57), VAS (MD = - 0. 06, 95 % CI = - 0. 81 to 0. 70), NDI (MD = - 1. 37, 95 % CI  = - 3. 17 to 0. 43), Odom criteria (OR = 0. 88, 95 % CI = 0. 60 to 1. 30) or fusion rate (OR = 1. 17, 95 % CI = 0. 34 to 4. 11).

40|$|The {{concept of}} total lumbar disc {{replacement}} (TDR) is gaining acceptance due to good clinical short-term outcome. Standard implantation is strict anterior, which poses especially above the segment L 5 /S 1 sometimes difficulties {{due to the}} vessel configuration. Therefore, oblique implantable TDR have been invented. In oblique implantation the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) is only partially resected, with additional partial resection of lateral annulus fibers. This could {{have an impact on}} biomechanical properties, which has not been evaluated until now. We therefore compared the standing ap and lateral X-rays pre- and postoperative after anterior and oblique implantation of TDR in segment L 4 / 5. Significant differences between the groups were not found. In both the anterior and oblique group, segmental lordosis showed a significant <b>increase,</b> whereas total <b>lordosis</b> as well as ap balance were unchanged. The absolute segmental <b>lordosis</b> <b>increase</b> was nearly double in the anterior group. In conclusion, both anterior and oblique implanted TDR significantly <b>increase</b> segmental <b>lordosis</b> while retaining total lordosis and ap balance. The segmental increase is lower in the oblique implanted group which is probably due to the remaining ALL.

In follow-up examinations radiographic analysis and clinical scores were examined. In radiographs the difference in disc heigt, segmental lordosis and sagittal vertebral misalignement to the preoperative state was measured. Clinical scores included ODI and VAS for overall, back, and leg pain. Depending on the clinical outcome patients {{divided into two groups}} (ODI 25 % group F) for correlation analysis to the radiographic parameters. We could examine 34 patients at a mean follow-up of 59. 5 month. 24 patients were assigned to group N, 10 patients to group F.

The aim {{of the study was to}} attempt to verify the relationship between the 2 main curvatures of the spine and its relation to symptoms in different parts of the musculoskeletal system, in a group of adults. It was assumed that hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine and misbalance of the thoraco-lumbar junction are risk factors for LBP.

40|$|To {{explore the}} spinal loads {{occurring}} in overhead working postures {{and to assess}} the value of ergonomic reduction of lumbar extension, spinal strain was measured by stature change in simulated motor vehicle maintenance tasks. A field study identified the typical extent of lumbar extension incurred {{in this type of}} work. In the laboratory eight male volunteers tightened and loosened bolts both overhead and at chest-height for 30 min periods; records were made of lumbar posture, ground reaction force, and perceived exertion. Stature change was measured using a refined technique which permitted estimation of net effect of the work loads. The field study revealed that motor mechanics typically spent 8 % of their time working overhead with up to 10 ° of lumbar extension. In the laboratory study, the overhead task entailed more lumbar extension and perceived exertion than did the chest-height task; ground reaction forces did not differ substantially between tasks. Only small changes in stature were observed {{at the end of the}} work period, and there was no significant difference between the tasks (means: overhead, + 0. 61 mm; chest-height, - 0. 23 mm: p = 0. 31). Stature change was significantly correlated with lordosis for overhead work such that <b>increased</b> <b>lordosis</b> (compared with chest-height work) was associated with relative stature gain. No evidence was found to indicate a need for ergonomic intervention in overhead work tasks so far as spinal loading is concerned.

Intervertebral disc degeneration of the cervical spine affects over {{one half of}} all individuals {{over the age of}} 40 years and the last decade has seen an alarming increase in cervical disc degenerative disease related surgeries. In spite of newer technological advancements in devices for disc degeneration disease, spinal disc replacement and fusion, revision surgery rates have remained unchanged. 90 % of the disc replacement revisions and 50 % of fusion related revision can be attributed to improper device selection. Therefore, the objective of this research is to evaluate disc arthroplasty (replacement) and arthrodesis (fusion) devices and identify optimal implant size (height) selection criteria for biomechanical competence in force transmission, motion, and neurologic tissue protection. Eleven osteo-ligamentous human cadaver cervical spines were biomechanically evaluated after surgical augmentation with different sized implants for both arthroplasty and arthrodesis. The biomechanical outcomes measured were range of motion, neutral zone, stiffness, articular pillar strains, facet forces and intervertebral foramen area. Increased disc distraction was found to <b>increase</b> <b>lordosis</b> of the spine, increase compressive strains in articular pillars and increase in intervertebral foramen area. The kinematics outcomes were surgery type and implant size dependent where fusion lead to decreased range of motion, while arthroplasty maintained the range of motion with differential outcomes based upon the size of the implant. The integration of these biomechanical data demonstrate an implant size /spacer height relationship with direct clinical importance and the ability to guide clinical decision making so as to reduce revision surgery due to deviant biomechanical function...|$|R

Difficulties with measuring sagittal parameters on radiographs are avoided with reformatted sagittal CT reconstructions due to the superior endplate clarity afforded by this imaging modality. Methods. A prospective study of 30 Lenke 1 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients receiving selective thoracoscopic anterior spinal fusion (TASF) was performed. Participants had ethically approved low dose CT scans at minimum 24 months after surgery {{in addition to their}} standard care following surgery. The change in sagittal contours on supine CT was compared to standing radiographic measurements of the same patients and with previous studies. Inter-observer variability was assessed as well as whether hypokyphotic and normokyphotic patient groups responded differently to the thoracoscopic anterior approach. Results. Mean T 5 - 12 kyphosis Cobb angle increased by 11. 8 degrees and lumbar <b>lordosis</b> <b>increased</b> by 5. 9 degrees on standing radiographs two years after surgery. By comparison, CT measurements of kyphosis and <b>lordosis</b> <b>increased</b> by 12. 3 degrees and 7. 0 degrees respectively. 95...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} tendon {{transference}} is employed {{to relieve the}} poliomyelitic gluteus limp. We believe {{that in order to}} remedy the gluteus limp, opposite sacrospinalis muscle is the best choice as a power source because it works synergistic with the affected glutei. On this belief, we have operated on twenty poliomyelitic patients with affected glutei since 1958. The short term results of this experiment {{have been found to be}} satisfactory. There remains, however, much problems to be studied in order to find techniques for building up muscle bulk and its size as a power source. The poliomyelitic gluteus limp is so peculiar that most orthopedic surgeons are able to make a correct diagnosis at a glance. Its awkwa-rdness is caused mainly by pelvic sagging to opposite side and swaying trunk toward disabled side. Furthermore pelvic back thrust simultaneously accompanied by <b>increased</b> lumbar <b>lordosis</b> makes the limp more awkward (Inman). To the orthopedic surgeon it presents a serious problem and it is reporte...|$|R
40|$|Background Recently, {{researchers}} evaluate disorders of the lumbo-pelvic region such as {{low back}} pain through assessment of movement patterns with various clinical tests. Prone knee-flexion {{is one of the}} most common tests, which are used. Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in lumbar lordosis during the prone knee-flexion test in healthy subjects. Patients and Methods This quasi-experimental study with repeated measurements was performed on 40 healthy subjects. Lumbar lordosis was measured with a standard flexible ruler first in prone position and then, after performing the prone knee-flexion test. The amount of change in lumber lordosis between the two measurements was recorded. Data were analyzed using paired t-test. Results Results demonstrated that there was a statistically significant difference in lumbar lordosis in prone position and after performing the prone knee-flexion test among healthy subjects (P < 0. 0001). Conclusions An <b>increased</b> lumbar <b>lordosis</b> during the prone knee-flexion test is due to instability in a lumbar spine region...|$|R
40|$|Hormonal {{imprinting}} develops {{during the}} perinatal critical period, when the target hormone meets the yet unmatured receptor. As {{a consequence of}} imprinting the receptor accomplishes its maturation reaching the binding capacity characteristic to adults. In this period {{in the presence of}} foreign molecules similar to the target hormone faulty imprinting may occur with life-long consequences. Soy bean contains phytosteroids which can mimic estrogen effects. In the present experiments single genistein (20 μg) or combined genistein + benzpyrene (20 μg) treatments were done neonatally and the sexual behavior of male and female adult animals was studied. Genistein significantly <b>increased</b> the <b>lordosis</b> quotient of females, which was compensated by neonatal benzpyrene treatment. Genistein also enhanced the sexual activity of males, and this was significantly not reduced by parallel benzpyrene treatment. The results show that neonatal genistein exposure can imprint sexual activity for life and the presence of a second imprinter can modify genistein's behavioral effect...|$|R
40|$|A {{reduction}} in the availability of oxidizable metabolic fuels inhibits reproduction. When ovariectomized, steroid-primed hamsters are food deprived for 48 hours, estrous behavior is suppressed. However, the specific neuroendocrine alterations that mediate the suppression or restoration of estrous behavior are unknown. In the following set of experiments, I investigated various possible neuroendocrine alterations associated with nutritional infertility and I found the following. Increasing circulating levels of estradiol can <b>increase</b> <b>lordosis</b> durations in fasted animals, but the suppression of estrous behavior occurs despite increased circulating estradiol levels in ovariectomized, steroid-treated animals. Next, I found that {{it takes more than}} 24 h of metabolic inhibitor administration to inhibit lordosis, whereas only 6 h of refeeding is sufficient to restore sexual receptivity. Furthermore, neither plasma insulin nor leptin levels parallel the changes in estrous behavior, suggesting that changes in circulating leptin and insulin probably do not {{play a critical role in}} these behavioral changes. Finally, several conditions that inhibit female sexual behavior are thought to be associated with altered corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) activity in the brain. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of CRH or urocortin inhibited estrous behavior in ovariectomized steroid-primed hamsters. Conversely, ICV infusion of the potent CRH receptor antagonist, astressin, prevented the suppression of estrous behavior by food deprivation. Furthermore, astressin blocked the inhibition of estrous behavior by ICV administration of neuropeptide Y and CRH but did not enhance estrous behavior in animals given an inadequate dose of progesterone. Astressin treatment also induced sexual receptivity in nonresponders, animals that do not normally come into heat when treated with hormones. This effect persisted in subsequent weekly tests in the absence of any further astressin treatment. Manipulations that altered sexual behavior did so without affecting food intake and, in most cases, without affecting circulating corticosteroid levels, indicating that the animals were neither ill nor stressed. These results support the hypothesis that endogenous CRH receptor signaling mediates the inhibition of estrous behavior by undernutrition and in other instances of sexual dysfunction suggesting that CRH receptor signaling may be a final common pathway by which a number of distinct conditions inhibit female sexual behavior. ...|$|R
