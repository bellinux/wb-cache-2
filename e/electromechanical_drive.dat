40|$|Pneumatic linear drives {{are widely}} used in manufacturing, mainly for {{handling}} tasks. Due to rising interest in environmental matters and increasing energy costs, energy efficiency {{has become a major}} issue in industrial applications. There is a growing competition between pneumatic and <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives.</b> Pneumatic drives are said to have a lower efficiency while the initial costs of <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives</b> are higher. The operating costs of electromechanical as well as pneumatic drives are induced by their exergy efficiency. The efficiency of the drives depends on parameters like cycle time, load applied to the cylinder and its acceleration and velocity. Former research did only provide limited data on the influence of these parameters. The paper provides an overview on the exergy efficiency of pneumatic and <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives</b> and its dependency on the mentioned parameters. Since <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives</b> are often used to replace pneumatic drives both technologies are examined in typical applications for pneumatic drives, including horizontal and vertical movement and sustaining a load for different periods in vertical usage...|$|R

40|$|In <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drive</b> units, {{the highly}} loaded sliding and rolling {{contacts}} are the failure-prone components in a drive train's mechanical part. Therefore this work introduces an early fault diagnosis to predict imminent failures or breakdowns. After a breakdown has occurred, {{conclusions can be}} drawn from previous history about the cause of failure and the defective subassembly or the failed machine part. It draws on a model-based approach, using so-called minimal models to determine individual characteristics that classify the faults. The minimal models are built on physical foundations and provide, for certain operating states, individual characteristics of time and temperature behavior, which, by themselves or in combination, allow to draw conclusions about changes in tribological systems of <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drive</b> units. Tests have confirmed the practicability of the model-based approaches. Not the absolute values of the characteristics are used for early fault diagnosis, but their change over time. The resulting trends enable reliable forecasts. As soon as changes to the characteristics have been identified as failure-relevant, they become symptoms that can be interpreted according to a set of rules. This allows for predictions regarding the expected fault, its time of occurrence, and the root cause. The evaluation is comprehensible to the user, since the use of minimal models matches the maintenance engineer's way of thinking. This enables the maintenance engineer to understand and check the plausibility of the conclusions drawn by the rule interpreter. The user is encouraged to add to the rule base from his own experience...|$|E

40|$|The {{very high}} {{specific}} work load of thermal shape memory alloys qualifies {{the material to}} be a suitable alternative of conventional drives. Especially the automotive industry is highly interested in drive concepts for substituting <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives.</b> In modern cars more than fifty drives are applied for several tasks like adjusting headlights, mirrors, flaps or to open/close doors, petrol caps and so on. Due to {{the increasing number of}} such mechatronic components the automotive manufacturer are getting serious problems with the increasing weight, the increasing costs and to provide the needed cross sections for these components. A suitable option to overcome this problem is using the shape memory technology to realise significantly smaller, lighter and cheaper drives.

However, the benefit of the technology compared to <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives</b> seems to be enormous.

40|$|Problems {{in using}} shape memory alloys (SMA) in {{industrial}} applications are often {{caused by the}} fragmentary knowledge of the complex activation behavior. To solve this problem, Fraunhofer IWU developed a Matlab®-based simulation tool to emulate the properties of a SMA wire based on the energy balance.

It is shown that {{there is almost no}} difference between the measured and the simulated actuator movement. Due to the good quality of the model it is possible to use it in a control loop. Knowing current and voltage enables the computation of the electrical resistance of the actuator and can therefore be used for feedback control. Implementation of the results into industrial applications is exemplified by integration of an actuator in a flap as used in air condition systems of cars. Furthermore, the SMA-based drive will be compared to an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drive...</b>|$|E

Modern permanent magnet (PM) motor technologies offer diversity of cutting-edge technology brushless motors, i. e., motors with one slot coil pitch windings, transverse flux motors, coreless disc type motors and PM assisted synchronous reluctance motors.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of electrical and mechanical parameters of high-performance <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drive</b> systems is {{of paramount importance}} for designing high-performance controllers and/or developing accurate simulation models. By high-performance control is meant least torque (position) ripple for torque (position) control. Machine parameters are typically load and temperature dependent.

The estimated parameters are stator resistance through dc test, dq inductances using high-frequency injection and permanent magnet flux by means of a closed-loop speed control maintaining rotor stationary. The proposed method does not require either locking the rotor or additional/special power supplies.

40|$|Currently, {{developers}} of multi-wheeled vehicles (MWV) show {{growing interest in}} <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drive</b> in the «motor-axis» implementation. However, in designing the traction electric drive (TED) based on such approach the problems arise, primarily, {{from a lack of}} creating experience and of ready algorithmic solutions to control the traction motors. The use of methods to implement the individual TED is impossible {{because of the presence of}} cross-axle differential in the leading axle drive, which does not allow the input torque control of each wheel singly. The paper offers a law to control a traction electric drive of MWV leading axles that comprises the law to control the tractive effort torque and braking moment on the leading axles as well as algorithms of anti-lock brake and traction control systems. An analysis of simulation modeling results shows an efficiency of the developed law that allows control of the traction electric drive of MWV leading axles. The control law includes an algorithm to control the tractive effort torque and braking moment on the driving-wheels, as well as algorithms of anti-lock brake and traction systems. At stationary (constant speed rotation) and non-stationary (elk test) maneuvering there was no spin of vehicle wheels. Angular speeds of the wheels vary smoothly. Partial loss of vehicle stability when making maneuvers on ice may be reduced through development of algorithms for dynamic stabilization, which will improve the MWV road-holding and trajectory ability.

40|$|It is {{established}} {{that at the}} present moment the roller screws (RS) are the most challenging mechanical transducers of rotational motion into forward motion. For that reason their field of application is being constantly enlarged. In the West one can observe the tendency of the replacement of hydraulic drive by RS-based <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drive.</b> The main RS parts are screw, thread rollers and female screw which on the load transmission interact in the contact lands located on the pitch diameters of the special thread of these parts. To exclude the edge contacts on the male screw and female screw the thread with triangular profile waps are performed, on the rollers – with convex profile. Besides the pitch diameters of the male screw, rollers and female screw thread form the closed-loop dimension chain, and the values of these diameters affect the RS axial play and its performance capabilities significantly. Therefrom in manufacturing thread pieces it is required {{to carry out the}} high-precision control of their thread pitch diameters. For the male thread this control is carried out by means of three cylindrical wires with preferred diameter. Such wires are available at the factories of the Russian Federation and are represented in AllUnion State Standard 2475 - 88 for the standard thread (metric, trapeziform and others), and they are not available for the RS pieces special thread. It was proposed for the RS pieces male thread pitch diameter control to use the standard wires, the diameter of which is the next larger to the necessary preferred diameter of the RS piece controlled thread. The article presents the preferred diameters of the wires for the RS thread pieces control with employed pitch of the special thread. The dependencies for sizing up of the RS pieces male screw and roller pitch diameter dimension control is deduced by utilizing the wires of unspecified diameter, including preferred diameter. In view of the RS potential it is required to set up in Russia the production of wires with preferred diameters for the RS pieces male thread control. In the long term while reexamination of the All-Union state standard 2475 - 88 it is required to enlarge the range of smooth wires with new ones intended for RS advanced concepts pieces male thread pitch diameter control...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a methodology to synthesize a fuzzy controller to correct the tracking dynamics of the <b>electromechanical</b> positioning <b>drive</b> trajectory. A general framework about topologies in the field of linear <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives</b> is presented. Special focus is made on parallel manipulators using tubular linear synchronous permanent magnet motors, where computer simulations confirmed large amplitude variations of load forces applied to linear actuators of the six degrees of freedom (6 DOF) parallel manipulator. The 6 DOF parallel manipulators are wide used for the support of the flight simulators, and are projected to emulate the aeronautic motions. The commercial 6 DOF parallel manipulators usually employ hydraulic linear actuators. The hydraulic linear actuators have bigger volume/power ratio than tubular linear synchronous motors and an expensive maintenance cost. The difficulties of these applications are {{in the absence of the}} trajectory planning, which is common in parallel manipulator applications. The fuzzy controller synthesis for the linear position drive is described. Its main goal is to perform the automatic adjustment of the tubular linear motor positioning trajectory, by changing its speed and acceleration references. The resulting motion trajectory obtained from the fuzzy controller is particularly suited to high accuracy applications such as parallels manipulators, robotics systems and factory automation. The <b>electromechanical</b> position <b>drive</b> present in this paper is based on Permanent Magnet Tubular Linear Synchronous Motor (PM-TLSM) as the electromechanical linear actuator fed by a position drive controller and a linear encoder as feedback device of the system. The structure of the laboratory prototype of the fuzzy controller coupled to the <b>electromechanical</b> linear position <b>drive</b> is presented. The experimental results demonstrate that the trajectory correction is made lower than 1 s. Comparing the experimental results with different loads, it is verified that the position errors values does not depend of the load force applied to the tubular linear motor shaft. The experimental results obtained are used to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy controller, which was able to reduce the positioning errors from 40 % to 10 %...|$|R
