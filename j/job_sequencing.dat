40|$|Special {{issue with}} papers {{presented}} at the 5 th International Conference on Optimization: Techniques and Applications (ICOTA) The following single machine scheduling problem is studied. A partition {{of a set of}} n jobs into g groups on the basis of group technology is given. The machine processes jobs of the same group contiguously, with a sequence independent setup time preceding the processing of each group. The setup times and the job processing times are controllable through the allocation of a continuously divisible or discrete resource to them. Each job uses the same amount of the resource. Each setup also uses the same amount of resource, which may be different from that for the jobs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{proposed}} a thermal-aware scheduling algorithm for peak temperature reduction with stochastic workloads. The proposed approach consists of two steps. The first step constructs a <b>job</b> <b>sequence</b> based on {{the mean of the}} execution time of each job; and the constructed <b>job</b> <b>sequence</b> interleaves the execution of hot jobs and cool jobs. The hot job pushes up the chip temperature while the cool one cools down the chip. Accordingly the chip reduces the peak temperature. The second step exploits the job slack to cancel out the adverse thermal impact due to the uncertainty of the job execution time. The slacks are allocated among the hot jobs. Hot jobs whose execution time deviates more above the average execution time will get more slack, vice versa. Experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively avoids the thermal emergency for the applications with stochastic workloads by achieving the peak temperature reduction of 4. 7 o C on average. 1...|$|R

40|$|Scheduling is an {{important}} process widely used in manufacturing, production, management, computer science, and so on. Appropriate scheduling can reduce material handling costs and time. Finding good schedules for given sets of jobs can thus help factory supervisors effectively control job flows and provide solutions for <b>job</b> <b>sequencing.</b> In simple flow shop problems, each machine operation center includes just one machine. If at least one machine center includes more than one machine, the scheduling problem becomes a flexible flow-shop problem. Flexible flow shops are thus generalization of simple flow shops. In this paper, we propose three algorithms to solve flexible flow-shop problems {{of more than two}} machine centers. The first one extends Sriskandarajah and Sethis method by combining both the LPT and the search-and-prune approaches to get a nearly optimal makespan. It is suitable for a medium-sized number of jobs. The second one is an optimal algorithm, entirely using the search-and-prune technique. It can work only when the job number is small. The third one is similar to the first one, except that it uses Petrovs approach (PT) to deal with <b>job</b> <b>sequencing</b> instead of search-and-prune.

40|$|Push-based MRP and pull-based Kanban {{systems are}} {{effective}} production control policies {{for a wide}} range of manufacturing environment. Both of them, however, have certain limitations when they are implemented in different production environments. In recent years, CONWIP (CONstant Work-In-process), a hybrid push/pull control policy, was proposed and studied to take advantages of MRP and Kanban systems for optimal work-in-process (WIP) inventory control. CONWIP is a closed production system in which a constant number of containers traverse a closed loop that includes the entire production system. In order to effectively implement CONWIP control in a manufacturing environment, several issues, such as the number of containers, lot sizes and <b>job</b> <b>sequence,</b> need to be addressed. This research aims at the development of mathematical models to address these issues and to help implement CONWIP systems in different manufacturing environments. Two mathematical programming models are developed to address issues on a single serial CONWIP line system. The first model can be used in a make-to-stock environment and the objective function of the model is to minimize the setup costs and the costs associated with an unbalanced workload at the bottleneck machine. The solution of the first model simultaneously determines the optimal <b>job</b> <b>sequence</b> on the part list and the lot size associated with each entry on the part list. The second model can be used in a make-to-order environment or in a make-to-stock environment with a known part list. The objective function of the second model is to minimize the system makespan. Two essential CONWIP system parameters, number of containers and <b>job</b> <b>sequence</b> can be determined by solving the second model. A third model is developed for an assembly-type CONWIP system with multiple fabrication lines feeding an assembly station. The objective of the third model is to synchronize system production by minimizing makespan differences among all the fabrication lines. The solution of the third model determines the number of the containers and <b>job</b> <b>sequence</b> for each of the fabrication lines. The solution of such models is NP-hard. The general branch and bound approach used by most off-the-shelf optimization software cannot be used to solve real sized problems of this nature. In order to solve real sized problems efficiently, we develop a heuristic search method based on simulated annealing. Several example problems are used to test the developed models and algorithms.
