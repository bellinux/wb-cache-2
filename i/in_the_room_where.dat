5|$|Hsin {{wins the}} lottery, but selects the tile {{representing}} his heart. Chao {{comes in and}} tries to persuade one of the game's organisers to let Hsin live but to no avail, causing Chao to knock over {{the table with the}} vases, which reveals the lottery to be fixed. Chao then storms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> the surgery on Hsin is about to be carried out and fires at the Hard Faced Man, after which the agents come in and arrest them all, including Chao for covering the existence of the game. They interrogate the Hard Faced Man, but because no one who participated will testify against him, it is unlikely he will be prosecuted. Hsin is brought to the hospital and his daughter is placed on an organ donor list. Chao mysteriously disappears, awakening in a crematorium oven before he is burned alive.|$|E
5|$|Ledward (Benjamin Rigby) is {{a member}} of the {{security}} unit aboard the Covenant. He {{is a member}} of the expedition tracking the signal leading to the crashed Engineer ship on the surface of the Engineer homeworld. Shortly after disembarking from the lander, Ledward is assigned by Lope to escort Karine Oram as she takes samples from the local ecosystem. Ledward excuses himself from his duties momentarily to smoke and urinate, during which time, he disturbs a mutated floral pod, causing airborne mutagen to enter his ear canal. His health immediately deteriorates and he is assisted to the lander by Karine. Inside the lander's medical bay, Faris locks Ledward and Karine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>where</b> the first Neomorph bursts out of his spine, killing him.|$|E

5|$|To prevent {{negotiations}} from succeeding, Price rigs the Summit {{hotel with}} explosives. To prevent Pakistani President Mudasser (Nicholas Khan) and Home Secretary Andrew Lawrence (Tobias Menzies) from escaping, he paralyses both of them. Learning Price {{is in the}} hotel, Lucas and Ros arrive and capture him. Since disarming the bomb is impossible, Ros threatens to leave Price behind when the bomb explodes unless he divulges the room both politicians are held. Although Price eventually discloses the room number, Ros leaves him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> the bomb is anyway. Lucas is able to carry Mudasser safely out of the hotel, where he recovers and orders {{the release of the}} Indian submarine, preventing the war. However, Ros is still in the hotel, struggling to pull Lawrence to safety. As Lucas runs back to aid her, the hotel explodes, killing Lawrence, Price and Ros.|$|E

25|$|Broadcasting {{began at}} the Empire State Building on December 22, 1931, when NBC and RCA began {{transmitting}} experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the spire, with two separate transmitters for the visual and audio data. They leased the 85th floor and built a laboratory there. In 1934, RCA was joined by Edwin Howard Armstrong in a cooperative venture to test his FM system from the building's antenna. This setup, which entailed {{the installation of the}} world's first FM transmitter, continued only until October of the next year because of disputes between RCA and Armstrong. Specifically, NBC wanted to install more TV equipment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> Armstrong's transmitter was located.|$|E

This version features a lot of added animation and distorted images, featuring black-and-white flames and bubbles.

Much of the animation focuses of images of soccer balls, which fly out of the television set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> the band plays, and out of the building's windows. Occasionally, the animations are only additions to the scenes, while other times the entire shots have been animated.

25|$|The {{original}} Hofburg palace {{was constructed}} from several elements under Archduke Sigismund around 1460. This structure included sections of medieval fortifications that {{ran along the}} eastern city wall. The building incorporated the Rumer Gate, which was later converted into the Heraldic Tower in 1499 by Jörg Kölderer under Emperor Maximilian I. The palace was expanded {{several times during the}} next 250 years. Between 1754 and 1773, the Hofburg palace underwent two stages of Baroque structural changes under Empress Maria Theresia: the south tract was constructed (1754–1756) on the Hofgasse according to plans by J. M. Gumpp the Younger, and the main façade was added (1766–1773) on the Rennweg according to plans by C. J. Walter. During this period, the Giants' Hall was completed with ceiling frescoes by F. A. Maulbertsch, and the Imperial Chapel was built (1765) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> Maria Theresa's husband Emperor Francis I had died.|$|E

Telling {{them that he}} is Malipiero, the Maniac asks for the Superintendent, who was {{involved}} with the interrogation with Pissani and the Constable. The Maniac orders the three policemen to re-enact {{the events of the}} interrogation; in turn fabricating many of the events, such as changing beating the anarchist to making jokes with him, incorporating new lines into the transcript and even breaking out in song. When the investigation reaches the matter of the fall, the Constable reveals he grabbed the anarchist's shoe, in an attempt to stop him from falling. However, the Maniac notes that witnesses reported that the anarchist had both shoes on. When Pissani surmises that the anarchist was wearing a galosh, the Superintendent breaks into a rage, making Pissani accidentally reveal that the Superintendent pushed the anarchist out of the window. The two policemen then realise that the Maniac was listening. The phone in the office suddenly rings, which Pissani answers. He tells them that it is a journalist called Maria Feletti, who the Superintendent agreed to meet to clear rumors about the interrogation, wanting to come up to the office.|$|E

Subsequently, the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office confirmed the cause of death as suicide by hanging. However, Cornell's widow, Vicky, questioned whether he would deliberately end his own life, and said that the drug Ativan, which her husband was taking, might have led him to commit suicide. She said: [...] "I know that he loved our children and he would not hurt them by intentionally taking his own life." ...|$|E
500|$|In the video, Janet Jackson {{takes on}} a darker persona, {{previously}} unseen in her own music videos. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News described her as [...] "Sporting a thick thatch of wig hair, and eyes darkened by coal-black makeup... sullen and arty... Janet, however, never looked tougher, or more in control." [...] In the video, a sign appears with the logo of the song's title. The scene then changes a spacecraft traveling past Earth before the camera zooms in inside. Then, the lights came on and reveal Michael and Janet inside a small hole. Suddenly, the spacecraft zooms out through the outer part of the galaxy, sending them screaming. In the first verse, Michael is seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> he is floating on gravity. Then, Michael is shown {{in a room with}} thousands of guitars where he breaks one while Janet sings the next verse. Then, it shows Michael dancing on the wall while Janet looks at her nail before playing a game of tag. Then, it shows Michael and Janet in a room where they are using a remote control by changing pictures of Gregory Peck, art painting, statues, etc. Next, it shows both Michael and Janet in the media room where they are playing a video game which Michael wins. Then, Janet sports a skimpy bikini in some scenes while {{at the core of the}} craft, grabs at her breasts, gives the camera a middle finger and simulates male urination where Michael is shown taking controls into some kind of Observation. (In the out-takes, there is a still color photograph of Michael also giving the camera a middle finger.) Meanwhile, Michael is seen in a white room while wearing a black robe where he is meditating before screaming which breaks the glass above him. Then, Michael and Janet perform a dance breakdown. Then, it cuts back to the media room where Janet is dancing with Michael being seen on the television screen while Janet does the same thing with Michael. Then, Michael is seen playing a tennis game where he is using a robotic orb to break jars. The video has influences of Japanese sci-fi Anime - several clips of the Zillion anime series, Vampire Hunter D 1985 movie, and the movie Akira can be seen in the background screens. The version of the video included on Michael Jackson's Vision is uncut and contains the [...] "Stop fucking with me" [...] lyric, which was censored in HIStory on Film, Volume II.|$|E

This paper studies these two elements solving the problem of parameter interaction (temperature- humidity) from an analytical point of view. The analytically obtained equations are experimentally validated through a case study.
