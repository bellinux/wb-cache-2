5|$|At Goerdeler's insistence, Stauffenberg {{is ordered}} to assassinate both Hitler and SS head Himmler at the Führer's command bunker, the Wolf's Lair. At a final briefing, Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim instructs the {{committee}} {{members in the}} use of pencil detonators. Stauffenberg also persuades General Fellgiebel, who controls all communications at Wolf's Lair, to cut off communications after the bomb blast. On July15, 1944, Stauffenberg attends a strategy meeting at Wolf's Lair with the bomb in his briefcase, but with Himmler not present at the meeting, Stauffenberg does not get the go-ahead from the committee leaders, and by the time von Quirnheim defies the others and tells him to do it anyway, the meeting is over. Meanwhile, the Reserve Army is mobilized by Olbricht, unbeknownst to Fromm, to stand by. With no action taken, Stauffenberg safely extracts himself and the bomb from the bunker, and the Reserve Army is ordered to stand down, believing that the mobilization was a drill. Back in Berlin, Olbricht and Stauffenberg are threatened by Fromm that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> control the reserve army again he will personally have them arrested; Stauffenberg goes to the committee to protest their indecisiveness and condemns Goerdeler, who has been selected to be chancellor after the coup. When Goerdeler demands that Stauffenberg be relieved, Beck informs him that the SS has issued a warrant for his arrest, and that he must leave the country immediately.|$|E

They can also perform grapple moves while holding a weapon. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> use a steel chair with full momentum, they automatically perform the Steel Chair DDT. If they are caused to bleed, they instantly get full momentum. Their special move {{can only be}} performed with a steel chair in hand. They strike themselves in the face repeated until they bleed. While this causes full momentum, it also causes critical head damage.|$|E

25|$|The live {{rock with}} mantis shrimp burrows are {{actually}} considered useful by {{some in the}} marine aquarium trade and are often collected. It {{is not uncommon for}} a piece of live rock to convey a live mantis shrimp into an aquarium. Once inside the tank, they may feed on fish and other inhabitants. They are notoriously difficult to catch when established in a well-stocked tank, and there are accounts of them breaking glass tanks. While stomatopods do not eat coral, smashers can damage it <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make a home within it.|$|E
25|$|Progressive Jargon Aphasia is a fluent or {{receptive}} aphasia {{in which the}} patient's speech is incomprehensible, but appears to make sense to them. Speech is fluent and effortless with intact syntax and grammar, but the patient has problems with the selection of nouns. Either they will replace the desired word with another that sounds or looks like the original one or has some other connection or they will replace it with sounds. As such, patients with jargon aphasia often use neologisms, and may perseverate <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> replace the words they cannot find with sounds. Substitutions commonly involve picking another (actual) word starting with the same sound (e.g., clocktower - colander), picking another semantically related to the first (e.g., letter - scroll), or picking one phonetically similar to the intended one (e.g., lane - late).|$|E
25|$|Waste {{material}} is removed continuously and deposited in refuse piles as above (or even by some Atta ants into streams). The {{division of labour}} in Acromyrmex echinatior leafcutter ants includes individuals who work almost exclusively in waste management: waste material (excreta, food refuse, etc.) frequently harbours Escovopsis (a microfungus that is parasitic on the fungus that A. echinatior tends) {{as well as other}} parasites, so spatial separation of waste material from the fungal garden and wider nest environment is of paramount importance. This is achieved by depositing waste material on downhill and downwind piles or in special deep underground refuse chambers. Distinct waste management workers also exist in Atta cephalotes and Atta colombica. The risk of waste-worker ants contaminating the fungal garden/nest is lowered by other ants attacking them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> enter the nest, whilst attacks are more frequent in species with internal refuse chambers (this also reinforces the division of labour). On the other hand, some species retain excreta and/or anal exudates within the nest to utilize it for antiparasite purposes: C. formosanus employs its faces as building material for the nest carton, the use of faceal material promotes the growth of Actinobacteria with natural antimicrobial activity (e.g. Streptomyces), combating fungal parasites like M. anisopliae. Colony members of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) defend themselves against the virulent Crithidia bombi parasite by consuming beneficial gut bacteria from the faces of conspecific after eclosing.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the game, Junpei wakes up in a cabin inside a cruise liner, wearing a {{bracelet}} displaying the number [...] "5". He escapes the room, and encounters eight people, including June. Zero announces over a loudspeaker that all nine are participants in the Nonary Game. Zero explains the rules, and states each carry an explosive in their stomach that will go off <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> bypass the digital root door locks. The 9th Man still goes through a door by himself, and is killed. Fearing what harm might come to them, the group adopts code names, and splits up to explore the ship. The player has the option to select which group that Junpei travels with, which affects the story; several choices lead to Junpei's death. Through various choices, Junpei learns of a previous Nonary Game, played nine years earlier, and the connections of the other characters through that, as well as studies about morphic resonance and stories of the Egyptian priestess Alice, who is frozen in ice-9.|$|E

2500|$|Clubs from smaller {{countries}} {{also have}} problems with this issue. Due to their smaller population base they receive less money from television rights.

Ottoman and European testimonies confirm that from the 16th to the 19th centuries Anatolian opium was eaten in Constantinople as much as it was exported to Europe.

2500|$|ZombiU was {{designed}} as a realistic zombie game. Fear was the game's core emotion and it should be played slowly, similar to some classic horror games. According to game director Jean-Phillipe Caro, players will do badly <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> play it as a fast-paced action shooter like Call of Duty and ignore the GamePad. A prominent game mechanic is the permadeath system, intended to increase its tension. With the system, the game featured several survivors instead of a hero character. Its narrative {{was designed}} to rely on environmental storytelling rather than cutscenes, and players would understand the story through the game experience. The team introduced a persistent level design, in which when players continue playing after their initial survivor is killed. Action by the previous survivor will still affect the game's world; previously-killed zombies will not re-spawn. The permadeath system was debated, with concerns about loading times and backtracking. To ensure that the game's narrative would continue after a player-controlled character died, the survivors were not voiced to avoid narrative dissonance; this made the player, not the survivors, the protagonist. Although Shrager was relieved when the central character was dropped, writing the game was the [...] "toughest challenge" [...] she had ever faced in games. Since survivors can die anywhere in the game, linking the story became difficult. The team introduced the Prepper, an important character who communicates with the survivors by radio to link them and advance the narrative. During development, the permadeath concept was nearly removed.|$|E
