500|$|Jay-Z was {{initially}} skeptical about signing Rihanna after he felt [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] {{was too big}} for her, saying [...] "when a song is that big, it's hard [...] to come back from. I don't sign songs, <b>I</b> <b>sign</b> artists". The audition resulted in Rihanna signing a six-album record deal with Def Jam Recordings in February 2005, {{on the same day}} of the audition, with Jay-Z saying [...] "There's only two ways out. Out the door after you sign this deal. Or through this window ...", meaning {{that he was not going}} to let her leave without signing a record deal.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Braeden {{experienced}} multiple contract negotiation issues, {{leading to}} former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell writing both Victor and Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) {{out of the}} series. Their departures were reportedly due to sudden salary cuts {{in the middle of}} already negotiated contracts. During his onscreen absence, contract negotiations ensued with unknown predictions from the series. On the situation of the soap cutting his contract, Braeden stated during an interview: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>sign</b> a three-year deal, I'm obligated to fulfill that deal. The producers, however, can come to me after a half-year and say, 'We've changed our minds.' Where in the world of business does this kind of contract exist? Do I blame the people for wanting to squeeze as much out of us as they can? I do not. The question is, when do you squeeze too much?" ...|$|E
500|$|By September, {{the band}} was {{experiencing}} financial difficulties. Financial planners Norton Warburg Group (NWG) had invested £1.3–3.3 million (up to £ in contemporary value) of the group's money in high-risk venture capital to reduce their tax liabilities. The strategy failed {{as many of the}} businesses NWG invested in lost money, leaving the band facing tax rates potentially as high as 83 percent. [...] "We made Dark Side and it looked as if we'd cracked it," [...] recalled Waters. [...] "Then suddenly these bastards had stolen it all. It looked as if we might be faced with huge tax bills for the money that had been lost. Eighty-three per cent {{was a lot of money}} in those days and we didn't have it." [...] Pink Floyd terminated their relationship with NWG, demanding the return of uninvested funds. [...] "By force of necessity, I had to become closely involved in the business side," [...] recalled Gilmour, [...] "because no one around us has shown themselves sufficiently capable or honest to cope with it, and I saw with Norton Warburg that the shit was heading inexorably towards the fan. They weren't the first crooks we stupidly allied ourselves with. Ever since then, there's not a penny that I haven't signed for. <b>I</b> <b>sign</b> every cheque and examine everything." ...|$|E

500|$|... (Acheson) {{insisted on}} having, {{as a legal}} adviser, a lawyer whose ability as a lawyer and whose {{judgment}} in politics and statesmanship could be greatly respected. He got Adrian Fisher for that, and he involved him {{in all of the}} political and other activities that he himself was involved in. The Secretary of State always is involved in a lot of controversial things, and here we had the McCarthy era, the attack on the whole concept of Foreign Service and the State Department, and a terrific controversy over what to do about China, who had [...] "lost China." [...] Fisher was always at Acheson's right hand when he was dealing with other people about these things. Wherever he went, Fisher's office was backstopping him, getting all the necessary background information so he'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up. Of course, Acheson's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when you took an agreement to him to be signed, his chief question was [...] "By what authority do <b>I</b> <b>sign</b> this?" [...] And whoever brought it to him to get it signed, had to be ready with the answer that would satisfy a lawyer -- [...] "by what legal authority" [...] -- as well as what it provides and so forth.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{signing a}} record deal with Def Jam Recordings, Rihanna was {{discovered}} in her home country of Barbados by American record producer Evan Rogers, who made the necessary arrangements for her to fly to New York. There, she recorded a collection of demos for a demo tape {{to be sent to}} record labels. One of the demos recorded was that of [...] "Pon de Replay", which was written and produced by Carl Sturken, Evan Rogers and Vada Nobles in 2004. The first to respond to the demo tape was Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam Recordings, where Rihanna auditioned for him and music executive L.A. Reid, in his office. Looking back on the audition and meeting Jay-Z, Rihanna explained during an interview how she felt before walking into the room, saying: [...] "That's when I really got nervous... I was like: 'Oh God, he's right there, I can't look, I can't look, I can't look!' I remember being extremely quiet. I was very shy. I was cold the entire time. I had butterflies. I'm sitting across from Jay-Z. Like, Jay-Zee. I was star-struck." [...] During the audition, Rihanna performed Whitney Houstons cover of [...] "For the Love of You", [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] and [...] "The Last Time", the latter two of which would go on to be included on her debut album, Music of the Sun. Initially, Jay-Z was skeptical about signing Rihanna, because he felt [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] was too big for her, saying [...] "when a song is that big, it's hard [...] to come back from. I don't sign songs, <b>I</b> <b>sign</b> artists". [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] was released via iTunes on July 26, 2005, through Def Jam Recordings.|$|E

2500|$|On March 11, March 2014, Johnson filed {{a lawsuit}} in the Ninth Judicial District Court in Alexandria against LC and Aguillard for {{wrongful}} termination based on the whistleblower complaint. Johnson, who was paid $146,000 annually in salary and benefits, is seeking damages, court costs, and [...] "general and equitable relief." [...] Johnson in the suit lists Aguillard as his [...] "joint employer", because, based on a released recording, Aguillard told an employee, who recorded the conversation: [...] "I am the employer, and <b>I</b> <b>sign</b> your contract. You don't work for the college. The college ... {{is a place of}} work. The employer is me, and the employee is you." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the Red Wings {{attempted}} {{to defend their}} 2008 Stanley Cup championship, Hossa met his former team, the Pittsburgh Penguins, as the two clubs met {{for the second straight}} year in the Final. The prospect of Hossa losing to the team he left in order to secure a Stanley Cup championship received considerable media attention. Prior to eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks in the Western Conference Finals, Hossa admitted meeting the Penguins in the finals [...] "would definitely be very interesting." [...] Ultimately, Hossa did, in fact, lose to his former team, falling by a 2–1 score in the seventh game. Immediately following the game, Hossa was asked whether he regretted his decision to leave the Penguins, to which he replied, [...] "Regret? [...] I don't regret it. [...] It could be different circumstances if <b>I</b> <b>sign</b> in Pittsburgh, they probably couldn't sign some other players and they'd be a different team." [...] Hossa finished the 2009 playoffs with six goals and nine assists for a total of 15 points over 23 games.|$|E
