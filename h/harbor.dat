5|$|USS Mahan was {{commissioned}} {{on the east}} coast in September 1936 and served in the Atlantic area until July 1937.

The ship joined Task Force 17 in February 1942, which conducted raids on several atolls in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands.

40|$|Fishing <b>harbors</b> {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in coastal regions in China. However, few studies about pollution by heavy metals in those fishing <b>harbors</b> have been reported. In this study, {{a total of}} 49 surface sediment samples were collected from nine <b>harbors</b> along the coastline of China to illuminate heavy metals pollution and their potential ecological risk. Results indicated that Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd are four main elements causing pollution with high concentrations detected in the selected <b>harbors.</b> These four metals from three <b>harbors</b> located in the Pearl River Delta are remarkably higher than those in other regions. The main finding {{of the study is}} that Cu was observed with rather high concentration in sediments, with the highest up to 1249 mg kg (1). Cu is widely used in antifouling paint for fishing ships, which may have been released into seawater and accumulated in marine sediment. High correlations of Cu, Pb and Zn with total organic carbon in sediments from these <b>harbors</b> indicate that the <b>harbors</b> may act as an important heavy metals source to the coastal environment of China. The potential ecological risk posed by Cu and Cd in the <b>harbors</b> of the Pearl River Delta region is from moderate to very high. Hence, there is an urgent need for more studies in this area...|$|R
