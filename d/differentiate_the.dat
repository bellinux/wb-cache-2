5|$|In 1840, {{in order}} to <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} colors from the war flag, Ghica adopted a new design for the former: a red-yellow-blue tricolor, with red on top and stripes of equal width. In the center was a white shield bordered with gold and decorated with the Wallachian eagle, wearing the princely crown and with a cross in its beak.|$|E

5|$|Edwin Klebs was {{the first}} to observe {{bacteria}} in the airways of persons having died of pneumonia in 1875. Initial work identifying the two common bacterial causes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, was performed by Carl Friedländer and Albert Fraenkel in 1882 and 1884, respectively. Friedländer's initial work introduced the Gram stain, a fundamental laboratory test still used today to identify and categorize bacteria. Christian Gram's paper describing the procedure in 1884 helped to <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> two bacteria, and showed that pneumonia could be caused by more than one microorganism.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, {{an attempt}} was made to {{relocate}} the original quarry where A. fragillimus and other species had been found, using ground-penetrating radar in an attempt to image bones still buried in the ground. This attempt failed because the fossilized mudstone bones were the same density as the surrounding rock, making it impossible to <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> two. A study of the local topography also showed that the fossil-bearing rock strata was severely eroded, and probably was so at the time Lucas made his discovery of A. fragillimus, indicating {{that a majority of the}} skeleton was gone by the time the vertebra and femur were recovered.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} for sexual dimorphism has been weakened. A 2005 {{study reported that}} previous claims of sexual dimorphism in crocodile chevron anatomy were in error, casting doubt {{on the existence of}} similar dimorphism between Tyrannosaurus rex sexes. A full-sized chevron was discovered on the first tail vertebra of Sue, an extremely robust individual, indicating that this feature could not be used to <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> two morphs anyway. As Tyrannosaurus rex specimens have been found from Saskatchewan to New Mexico, differences between individuals may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual dimorphism. The differences could also be age-related, with 'robust' individuals being older animals.|$|E
5|$|Peace on Earth is {{the first}} Christmas album by American Christian rock band Casting Crowns. Produced by Mark Hall and Mark A. Miller, it was {{released}} on October 7, 2008.

As co-producer, Hall attempted to <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> album from their previous ones by attempting to use creative ideas they had not tried before, and he also wanted to utilize the band's female members in a broader and more visible role on the album.|$|E

5|$|The Brittens are {{involved}} in a fatal car crash. As a result, Michael Britten, a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detective, begins to live in two separate realities. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife Hannah Britten (Laura Allen) survives the crash, and in the other reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son Rex Britten (Dylan Minnette) survives. Michael does not know which reality is real, and uses the wristbands to <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> two.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} designed {{as part of}} the Dizzy series, with a working title of Movieland Dizzy, but the creators of Dizzy disagreed with the real-world direction the game had taken, despite it being 90% complete.

Seymour was adapted from Dizzy, with a new shape and fingers to <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> two.|$|E
5|$|The work is scored for vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir SATB, and an {{orchestra}} of two flauto traverso (Ft), two oboes (Ob), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins, viola (Va), and basso continuo. Bach added some instruments which were already old-fashioned {{at the time}} in arias for special effects, such as the archlute, the viola d'amore and the viola da gamba (Vg). Bach did not <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> vox Christi (voice of Christ), singing the words of Jesus, from the other bass recitatives and arias, nor the evangelist from the tenor arias.|$|E

5|$|Though ideologically {{the temples}} are {{divided between the}} sects of Hinduism, namely Saivism and Vaishnavism, the Char Dham pilgrimage is an all-Hindu affair. There are four abodes in the Himalayas called Chota Char Dham (Chota meaning small): Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotriall of which lie {{in the foothills of}} the Himalayas. The name Chota was added during the mid of 20th century to <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} Char Dhams. As the number of pilgrims to these places has increased in modern times, it is called Himalayan Char Dham.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> {{hartebeest}} from other antelopes. The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the sassabies (genus Damaliscus), {{such as an}} elongated and narrow face, {{the shape of the}} horns, the pelage texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest. The hartebeest exhibits sexual dimorphism, but only slightly, as both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and 23% heavier in the red hartebeest. In one study, the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good predictor of dimorphism in pedicle (the bony structures from which the horns grow) height and skull weight, and the best predictor of the horn circumference.|$|E
5|$|In the Australasian and Middle Eastern markets, {{to further}} <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> Aurion from its Camry sibling, Toyota {{equipped}} the Aurion exclusively with a 3.5-litre V6 engine. With the Camry, the company only offered the 2.4-litre four-cylinder version. Previously in these markets, {{prior to the}} introduction of the Camry XV40, Toyota had offered both four- and a six-cylinder powerplants. Along with the naturally aspirated version, Toyota produced an Australia-only supercharged TRD Aurion between 2007 and 2009 as tuned by Toyota Racing Development (TRD). At its release, Toyota claimed this performance variant to be the world's most powerful front-wheel drive car. The powertrains used in the Asian specification Camry vary slightly from those of the Aurion. As well as the 3.5-litre V6, two four-cylinder engines are offered in either 2.0- or a 2.4-litre form. These engines are teamed with a six-, four- and five-speed automatic transmissions, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Initially the {{sandwich}} {{was made with}} a plain bun; however, that changed when the company switched to a sesame-seeded bun around 1970. In 1985, {{the weight of the}} Whopper was increased to , while the bun was replaced by a Kaiser roll. This was part of a program to improve the product and featured a US$30 million (approx US$66 million in 2014) advertising campaign featuring various celebrities such as Mr. T and Loretta Swit. The goal of the program was to help <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> company and its products from those of its competitors. The Whopper reverted to its previous size in 1987 when a new management team took over the company and reverted many of the changes initiated prior to 1985. The Whopper sandwich's Kaiser roll was changed back into a sesame seed bun in 1994, eliminating the last trace of {{the sandwich}}'s 1985 reconfiguration.|$|E
5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic {{design management}} is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating {{a relationship between the}} design and corporate strategy. It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the corporate strategy formulation process. Strategic design management is responsible for {{the development and implementation of}} a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact with the needs of corporate management and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, there is often a strong belief in the potential to <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, design thinking becomes integrated into the corporate culture. Depending on the type of company and industry the following job titles are associated with this function: design strategist, strategic design manager, chief design officer, vice president design and innovation, chief creative officer, innovation design director, and others.|$|E
5|$|The Burger King Specialty Sandwiches are {{a line of}} {{sandwiches}} {{developed by}} the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King in 1978 and introduced in 1979 {{as part of a}} new product line designed to expand Burger King's menu with more sophisticated, adult oriented fare beyond hamburgers. Additionally, the new line was intended to <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> company from other fast food hamburger restaurants at the time. Since the line's introduction, the other sandwiches have been discontinued, leaving the chicken offering, the Original Chicken Sandwich (abbreviated as OCS), as the primary product left. Additionally, other sandwiches that utilize the same roll as the chicken sandwich have been introduced to the company's menu both domestically and internationally since the original product line was introduced.|$|E

5|$|The film {{had been}} in {{development}} since 1990 at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, or New Line Cinema at various times, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2006. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures as its distributor. Favreau signed on as director, aiming for a naturalistic feel, and he chose to shoot the film primarily in California, rejecting the East Coast setting of the comics to <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> film from numerous superhero films set in New York City-esque environments. Filming began in March 2007 and concluded in June. During filming, the actors were free {{to create their own}} dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armors, created by Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title character.|$|E
5|$|The shell {{shape of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is similar to}} that of Theodoxus transversalis. The shell shape of Theodoxus danubialis is more spherical. The shape of the {{aperture}} of Theodoxus prevostianus is usually descending. However, all of these species display a large morphological plasticity, which makes them difficult to <b>differentiate.</b> <b>The</b> overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature. Though the coloration and patterns of the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens, opercular characters can be used for a proper identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The calcified operculum of T. fluviatilis is D-shaped, light reddish with a red margin, bearing a broad rib (also called a ridge) on its inner surface. The columellar muscle is attached to the rib. The rib is long and thin, attenuated at the base, while the callus is thin; a peg is lacking. The characteristic features of the operculum are already visible in juveniles. There is sexual dimorphism on the border of the rib shield of the operculum, which is straight in females, but curved in males.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} titled Best of Both Worlds Tour after {{the song of}} the same name, which was the theme to Hannah Montana and was {{released}} on the series' first soundtrack. The title was chosen because of how the concert alternates between Cyrus performing as Hannah Montana and herself. She described the tour to <b>differentiate</b> <b>the</b> two according to their respective styles and depict how one girl was able to have two sides to her. She said the most notable difference between the two characters was the style of music, rather than physical appearance. According to her, Hannah Montana was direct pop music, while her own style was more rock music-oriented and included real-life scenarios set to tunes. Cyrus rehearsed for the tour simultaneous to filming the final episodes for the second season of Hannah Montana from September to October2007.|$|E
