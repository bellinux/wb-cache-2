50|$|Spain on {{the west}} coast of North America: For Europeans in the Age of Exploration western North America {{was one of the most}} distant places on earth (9 to 12 months of sailing). Spain had long claimed the entire west coast of the Americas. The area north of Mexico however was given little {{attention}} in the <b>early</b> <b>years.</b> <b>This</b> changed <b>when</b> the Russians appeared in Alaska. The Spanish moved north to California and built a series of missions along the Pacific coast including: San Diego in 1767, Monterey, California in 1770 and San Francisco in 1776. San Francisco Bay was discovered in 1769 by Gaspar de Portolà from the landward side because its mouth is not obvious from the sea. The Spanish settlement of San Francisco remained the northern limit of land occupation. By sea, from 1774 to 1793 the Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest tried to assert Spanish claims against the Russians and British. In 1774 Juan José Pérez Hernández reached what is now the south end of the Alaska panhandle. In 1778 Captain Cook sailed the west coast and spent a month at Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island. An expedition led by Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra sailed north to Nootka and reached Prince William Sound. In 1788 Esteban José Martínez went north and met the Russians for the first time (Unalaska and Kodiak Island) and heard that the Russians were planning to occupy Nootka Sound. In 1789 Martinez went north to build a fort at Nootka and found British and American merchant ships already there. He seized a British ship which led to the Nootka Crisis and Spanish recognition of non-Spanish trade on the northwest coast. In 1791 the Malaspina expedition mapped the Alaska coast. In 1792 Dionisio Alcalá Galiano circumnavigated Vancouver Island. In 1792-93 George Vancouver also mapped the complex coast of British Columbia. Vancouver Island was originally named Quadra's and Vancouver's Island in commemoration of the friendly negotiations held by the Spanish commander of the Nootka Sound settlement, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra and British naval captain George Vancouver in Nootka Sound in 1792. In 1793 Alexander Mackenzie reached the Pacific overland from Canada. By this time Spain was becoming involved in the French wars and increasingly unable to assert its claims on the Pacific coast. In 1804 the Lewis and Clark expedition reached the Pacific overland from the Mississippi River. By the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819 Spain gave up its claims north of California. Canadian fur traders, and later a smaller number of Americans, crossed the mountains and built posts on the coast. In 1846 the Oregon Treaty divided the Oregon country between Britain and the United States. The United States conquered California in 1848 and purchased Alaska in 1867.|$|R

Head Start was supposed to be reauthorized in 2003, but for two years Congress was immobilized as the Administration and a few Republican allies pushed for what they saw as needed improvements in the program—while oppo-nents argued that the proposals would hurt poor children.

40|$|The {{impact of}} piracy on digital media sales is an {{important}} academic, managerial, and policy question. Answers to this question are particularly salient for theatrical piracy where rights-holders and policy-makers are struggling to determine both {{the size of the}} problem and the appropriate legislative and managerial responses, and where there are few if any rigorous academic studies to guide their decisions. The importance of this question became particularly clear <b>earlier</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>when</b> a pirated copy of the movie “X-Men Origins: Wolverine ” appeared on Internet weeks before its official theatrical release, generating many hundreds of thousands of downloads before the movie was available in theaters. In this paper we analyze a new dataset collected from an Internet file-sharing site to examine the impact of pre-release theatrical piracy on box office revenues. Using a variety of empirical models and propensity score matching controls for endogeneity, we find that the presence of pre-release piracy reduces a movie’s box office revenue by approximately 15 %, {{that the vast majority of}} this reduction occurs in the movie’s opening weekend, and that pirated copies of higher quality have a less severe impact on box office sales than lower quality pirated copies do. Theory and Model Development To test the impact of pre-release piracy across a movie’s lifecycle we need to build a model to explain both the box office sales of movies and the distribution of sales to different time periods. Most movies see the highest level of sales in the opening weekend, with sales declining in subsequent weeks. Consistent with existing literature in marketing and information systems (e. g. Sawhney and Eliashberg 1996, Krider and Weinberg 1998), we model the box office revenue of movies using an exponentially declining function: where BO it = m e = e −λ it + ε it log mi −λi t + ε i...|$|E
40|$|In {{recognition}} of outstanding leadership {{and commitment to}} rural health, The University of Notre Dame Australia’s fourth-year Physiotherapy student, Daniel Mahony, has been awarded the Australian Physiotherapy Association (APA) National Board of Directors Student Prize. With {{an emphasis on the}} multidisciplinary nature of involvement and care, the prize will include travel and accommodation for Mr Mahony to attend the upcoming APA Congress, where he will be rewarded for his extraordinary leadership and ability to inspire within the community. Dean of Physiotherapy, Professor Peter Hamer, said Mr Mahony’s passion and determination to improve health outcomes for rural and remote Australians was a testament to his good character and commitment to the profession. “As soon as Daniel joined our physiotherapy program, he became involved in the multidisciplinary student group Western Australian Allied Health Interested in Bush Experience and his enthusiasm in this area soon saw him recognised to take on the role of secretary in 2008, President in 2009 and Vice President in 2010,” said Professor Hamer. “He has made significant impact in areas of membership growth, securing of scholarships to support allied health students on rural clinical placements and has organised and volunteered at many events as well as being interviewed by the ABC National Radio about issues facing allied health students. ” Professor Hamer said Mr Mahony had also attended and presented at numerous rural health conferences around Australia and was recently invited to attend the Services for Australian Rural and Remote Allied Health (SARRAH) National Conference as a keynote speaker later this year. “Daniel is a true advocate for rural programs and a born volunteer and leader.
