5|$|In 787, Pope Hadrian sent a pallium to Hygberht of Lichfield, <b>elevating</b> Lichfield to an archbishopric, and Ecgfrith was crowned. There is no extant {{contemporary}} evidence, however, that Jænberht ever recognised Hygberht as an archbishop. Canterbury retained as suffragans {{the bishops}} of Winchester, Sherborne, Selsey, Rochester, and London. The dioceses of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc and Elmham were transferred to Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|Assessments of Sorabji's music vary widely. While some, such as {{the pianist}} John Ogdon and the organist Kevin Bowyer, speak of him as {{comparable}} to such composers as Bach, Beethoven, Chopin and Messiaen, others dismiss him altogether. Reviews of concerts featuring Sorabji's music tend to be similarly mixed, some reviewers <b>elevating</b> him to the ranks of figures such as Debussy, and others describing his music as vacuous.|$|E
5|$|But {{the player}} {{primarily}} responsible for <b>elevating</b> the Modern Benoni {{to the status of}} a major opening was Mikhail Tal, who took up the opening in 1953 after seeing one of Nezhmetdinov's games. The tactical positions it led to were a perfect fit for Tal's combinatorial gifts and he crushed many opponents in brilliant style. Famous examples include his game against Bukhuti Gurgenidze at the 1957 USSR championship, excerpted below, and his win against Yuri Averbakh at the same tournament the following year.|$|E

5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and Remarks {{on the natural}} history of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle. In it he expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how {{the presence or absence of}} coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is <b>elevating</b> or subsiding. At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} {{with the people}} of the Arab world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to rumors that the Baghdad Pact countries were attempting to topple Syria's leftist government. Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further <b>elevating</b> his prestige in the Arab world, and particularly among Syrians.|$|E
5|$|From 1876, the South Saskatchewan river {{crossing}} at St. Louis was via ferry. In 1912, the railway built a rail {{bridge across the}} river, and in 1928, the vehicle lanes were added. After 1907, the highway was constructed south of Chamberlain and reached Buffalo Pound. At this time two horse scrapers and walking plows were the implements of road construction technology. This highway received an improvement in 1926 which then used an <b>elevating</b> grader, 16 horses and a dump wagon.|$|E
50|$|The Causeway Street <b>Elevated</b> {{was one of}} {{the last}} pieces of <b>elevated</b> line {{constructed}} in Boston, and, except for a short section remaining at Lechmere, was the last section in service. Although initial plans had called for the Cambridge-Dorchester Line to be constructed as an <b>elevated,</b> the Causeway Street <b>Elevated</b> was the only <b>elevated</b> in Boston not part of the Main Line <b>Elevated.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 326, Constantine {{reversed}} this pro-equestrian trend, raising many {{administrative positions}} to senatorial rank and thus opening these offices {{to the old}} aristocracy, {{and at the same}} time <b>elevating</b> the rank of already existing equestrian office-holders to senator, degrading the equestrian order —at least as a bureaucratic rank —in the process, so that by the end of the 4th century the title of perfectissimus was granted only to mid-low officials.|$|E
5|$|In Eurasia, some {{authorities}} {{distinguish between}} cultivated and wild versions of parsnips by using subspecies P. s. sylvestris for the latter, or even <b>elevating</b> it to species status as Pastinaca sylvestris.

5|$|The oral {{legends and}} texts {{initiate}} {{a process of}} Sanskritization of the folk deity Khandoba by <b>elevating</b> him to the classical Hindu god Shiva; his two principal wives Mhalsa and Banai are equated to Parvati and Ganga. Banai {{does not appear in}} the Sanskrit Malhari Mahatmya, the main scripture related to Khandoba, however it mentions Ganga arriving from heaven. Banai (Ganga) has a quarrel with Mhalsa (Parvati), ultimately ending with the message that both are the same. Some Dhangars consider Banai also to be a form of Parvati.|$|E

25|$|On April 10, 1888, the Union <b>Elevated</b> {{opened the}} first piece of the Myrtle Avenue <b>Elevated,</b> from Adams Street at City Hall east over Myrtle Avenue to Grand Avenue, where it junctioned with the Brooklyn <b>Elevated.</b> The company {{operated}} through {{to the end of the}} Brooklyn <b>Elevated</b> at Van Siclen Avenue. Another branch operated by the Union <b>Elevated,</b> the Broadway <b>Elevated</b> from Gates Avenue northwest to Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, opened on June 25, 1888. This was extended to Broadway Ferry on July 14, 1888. The Myrtle Avenue <b>Elevated</b> was extended north over Adams Street to Sands Street at the Brooklyn Bridge on September 1, 1888, and the Union <b>Elevated</b> began running between Sands Street and Van Siclen Avenue. The Union <b>Elevated</b> opened the Hudson Avenue <b>Elevated,</b> a branch of the Brooklyn <b>Elevated</b> from the intersection of Hudson and Park Avenues south to the Long Island Rail Road's Flatbush Avenue terminal, on November 5, 1888, and began operating between Fulton Ferry and Flatbush Avenue.|$|R
5|$|The {{story of}} Jaws {{is limited by}} how the humans respond to the shark menace. The fish is given much detail, with {{descriptions}} of its anatomy and presence creating the sense of an unstoppable threat. <b>Elevating</b> the menace are violent descriptions of the shark attacks. Along with a carnivorous killer on the sea, Amity is populated with equally predatory humans: the mayor has ties with the mafia, an adulterous housewife, criminals among the tourists.|$|E
5|$|An archbishopric in Mercia {{would also}} {{reinforce}} the kingdom's independence and free it from ecclesiastical dependence on Canterbury {{in the kingdom}} of Kent, which Offa had recently brought under Mercian control. Jænberht supported the Kentish king Egbert II, who was not known as a firm supporter of Offa's; an archbishop at Canterbury who was either indifferent or in active opposition to Offa would be an impediment to Offa's ability to establish overlordship of Kent and other areas of England. By <b>elevating</b> another archbishop, Offa would reduce the political power of the archbishops of Canterbury. Elevation of a bishopric to an archbishopric was not unprecedented; in 735 the papacy had elevated another Anglo-Saxon bishopric to an archbishopric, when Ecgbert became the first Archbishop of York.|$|E
5|$|As {{the power}} and {{reputation}} of Pietro II grew, the Venetian people {{began to wonder if}} he was secretly planning to establish a hereditary monarchy. Their fears were confirmed when his son, Otto Orseolo (named after Otto III), assumed the title of Doge upon Pietro II's death in 1009, thereby becoming the youngest Doge in Venetian history at the age of 16. Scandal marked much of Otto's reign as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism by <b>elevating</b> several relatives to positions of power. In 1026, he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to Constantinople, but his successor, Pietro Barbolano, had such difficulty in attempting to unite the city that it seemed infighting would once again seize Venice.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian {{separated}} and enlarged the empire's civil and military services and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing {{the largest and}} most bureaucratic government {{in the history of the}} empire. He established new administrative centres in Nicomedia, Mediolanum, Antioch, and Trier, closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome had been. Building on third-century trends towards absolutism, he styled himself an autocrat, <b>elevating</b> himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{is needed in}} a case of a severe allergic reaction. Before calling for help, laying a person down and <b>elevating</b> the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, they will be given an EpiPen or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses of adrenaline and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis.|$|E
