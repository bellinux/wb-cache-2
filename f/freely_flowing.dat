2500|$|Antelope Island {{is known}} for its scenic beauty, {{especially}} in the northwest quadrant of the island at Buffalo Point and White Rock Bay, where mountains and hills overlook beaches as well as the reflecting waters of the Great Salt Lake and other islands that are visible in the lake. [...] A balloon festival is held yearly, around Labor Day. [...] Birdwatching on Antelope Island is well known. Hiking and cycling are popular activities, but water is scarce and there are few trees on the island. Though not strictly a desert island there are no permanent human inhabitants and conditions are quite dry and can be very hot during the summer. [...] <b>Freely</b> <b>flowing</b> fresh water is not readily available on the island, though there are a few natural springs, mostly in the mountainous spine of the island and towards {{the south end of the}} island. [...] Water and restrooms are available in the visitor areas of the island. [...] There is a giftshop and small fast food restaurant that is open during the main visitor season. [...] It is located at Buffalo Point. [...] Public beaches, a marina and overnight camping areas are available and popular on the northern part of the island. Observing wildlife is also popular on Antelope Island, especially the large numbers of bison which are part of the Antelope Island bison herd. [...] Coyotes and antelope are sometimes seen close to the main roads and campsites, and bison often wander across the roads, though the bison are most often found towards the south end of the island near the Fielding Garr Ranch. [...] Other activities on the island include visiting the historical Fielding Garr Ranch, horseback riding and photography. [...] Trail running on the island has devotees, and several trail running races are held on the island each year at distances of 25 kilometers, 50 kilometers, 50 miles and 100 miles.

30|$|This type of {{architecture}} {{is based on the}} concept of “defense in depth”. This is a security approach that protects against the failure of one or more components in a level from cascading to other levels by installing security and other measures at the communication boundaries between levels. Thus, network traffic can <b>freely</b> <b>flow</b> between devices within the same layer while traffic that crosses between layers is strictly controlled. Any digital system deployed as part of the smart manufacturing strategy must therefore comply with the architecture and mirror the controls in place [20, 23].|$|R
50|$|In Finland, waterbodies are {{generally}} privately owned, {{which is not}} the case in most EU countries, but Finland also applies the Roman law principle of aqua profluens (flowing water), according to which the <b>freely</b> <b>flowing</b> water in waterbodies cannot be owned or possessed. This means that the owners of waterbodies cannot prohibit diversion of water for agricultural, industrial, municipal, or domestic use according to the provisions of the Finnish Water Law and cannot prohibit use of the waterbodies for recreational purposes.|$|E

50|$|From {{here there}} are three paths that a forming surface {{structure}} can take.Two stem from a diapir base, and the third from a sheet base. The sheet becomes a source-fed thrust, not unlike the thrust piercement, it takes advantage of local fault planes to rise. The {{difference between the two}} diapir bases, is that one, termed a plug-fed thrust, has a sediment cap over the top, preventing the salt from <b>freely</b> <b>flowing</b> until building pressure forces it through the cap; the other, a plug-fed extrusion, lacks the sediment cap and is allowed to flow freely.|$|E
50|$|A {{sewer pipe}} is {{normally}} at neutral air pressure {{compared to the}} surrounding atmosphere. When a column of waste water flows through a pipe, it compresses air ahead {{of it in the}} pipe, creating a positive pressure that must be released so it does not push back on the waste stream and downstream trap water seals. As the column of water passes, air must <b>freely</b> <b>flow</b> in behind the waste stream, or negative pressure results. The extent of these pressure fluctuations is determined by the fluid volume of the waste discharge.|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{means of}} {{attenuating}} airborne sound usually require blocking the air medium {{with a solid}} material. By exploiting properties of membrane-type acoustic metamaterials (MAMs), we demonstrate large transmission loss to be achievable across a sizable orifice through which air can <b>freely</b> <b>flow.</b> We find that interaction of resonating field of the MAMs with the continuous sound field passing through the orifice is responsible for such phenomenon. The narrow-band characteristic of this effect {{can be used for}} acoustic filtering of noise with a particular narrow frequency band. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R
50|$|The SR {{contains}} {{ion channel}} pumps, within its membrane {{that are responsible}} for pumping Ca2+ into the SR. As the calcium ion concentration within the SR is higher than {{in the rest of the}} cell, the calcium ions won't <b>freely</b> <b>flow</b> into the SR, and therefore pumps are required, that use energy, which they gain from a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). These calcium pumps are called Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ATPases (SERCA). There are a variety of different forms of SERCA, with SERCA 2a being found primarily in cardiac and skeletal muscle.|$|R
