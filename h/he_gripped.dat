25|$|Hughes batted with an {{orthodox}} upright, side-on stance. <b>He</b> <b>gripped</b> the bat {{high on the}} handle and played his strokes with a controlled backlift and a full follow through. He got his body well behind the ball in defence but early in his innings tended to move around the crease {{in front of his}} stumps, leaving him vulnerable to a leg before wicket dismissal.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, {{he enlisted}} in the Australian Defence Force after the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, and served in the anti-aircraft regiments of the Ninth Division in the Middle East, before being deployed to Papua New Guinea. There, Sergeant Iverson developed an unorthodox method of spinning the ball, which <b>he</b> <b>gripped</b> between his thumb and middle finger. This enabled him to bowl a wide variety of deliveries, including off breaks, leg breaks and googlies, without any change of action. At this stage he was only playing socially in spontaneous recreation with other army colleagues.|$|E
500|$|A {{short and}} stocky left-handed batsman, Hill had a crouched, {{somewhat}} awkward stance. <b>He</b> <b>gripped</b> the bat {{low on the}} handle, playing with a strong bottom hand. [...] His batting style was nonetheless attractive and effective and he was especially strong on the leg side and when cutting. [...] Able to score quickly when required, he was also recognised for his patience and strong defence. [...] Hill normally batted at No. 3 and, along with his contemporary Victor Trumper, he was a mainstay of the Australian batting line-up {{in the early years}} of the 20th century. [...] Hill had a strong throwing arm and was an excellent outfielder. [...] He was a popular team-mate and captain, respected for his directness, honesty and cheerfulness.|$|E

500|$|Originally a fast-medium bowler—a {{style to}} which he {{sometimes}} reverted when Surrey were short of bowlers—Fender's main bowling style was wrist spin, and he could spin the ball effectively. <b>He</b> <b>gripped</b> the ball differently from most wrist spinners, using his thumb and first two fingers, and would attempt any kind of unorthodox delivery if he {{thought it might be}} effective. To deceive the batsman he varied [...] the position from which he bowled and the height of his arm, and occasionally bowled deliberate full tosses or long hops to surprise them. Fender hoped that, in his eagerness to score from an apparently innocuous ball, the batsman would mis-hit, a tactic he would often try when the batsman was playing defensively. Fender's love of experimentation and his surprise variations made him difficult for batsmen to face, but produced inconsistent results and he sometimes conceded many runs. His Wisden obituary suggests that Fender would have been better employed as a [...] "fourth or fifth bowler in a strong bowling side", but Surrey's weakness in bowling meant that he had to do far more work than was ideal for his style and approach. Despite his experimentation, critics regarded him as a reliable bowler using his primary method, and The Times described him as [...] "subtle in flight and with artful variations".|$|E
2500|$|In Australia he was overbowled and {{exhausted}} {{and found that}} his natural in-swingers were liked by Australian leg-side batsmen like Sid Barnes. To counter this <b>he</b> <b>gripped</b> the ball across the seam like a spinner {{and the result was}} an in-swinging leg-break which would be known as Bedser's [...] "Special Ball". Don Bradman wrote [...] "the ball with which Alec Bedser bowled me in the Adelaide Test Match was, I think, the finest ever to take my wicket. It must have come three-quarters of the way straight on my off-stump, then suddenly dipped in to pitch on the leg stump, only to turn off the pitch and hit the middle and off stumps." ...|$|E
2500|$|His stance {{was perhaps}} the most [...] "two-eyed" [...] known {{in the history of the}} game, with his right {{shoulder}} typically turned so far round as to be facing mid-off, and <b>he</b> <b>gripped</b> the bat with the hands at the extreme ends of the handle. Such a stance would naturally lead to a defensive player who only had strokes on the leg side and would be dull and ugly. Bakewell, however, owing to his superb footwork and amazing dexterity in moving the bat, could and did easily place himself far wide of the leg stump for a ball on off stump. This allowed Bakewell to produce some of the most remarkable strokes, such as cutting sharp off-breaks pitched on middle stump and difficult hooks of short-pitched balls. Though his defence was suspect in his early days, he did work on this problem with considerable success.|$|E

5|$|His bat {{touches the}} turf {{in line with}} the off-stump, but his feet are well clear of the leg stump. <b>He</b> <b>grips</b> the bat near the tip of the handle, and it gives an {{impression}} that the bat is inordinately long.|$|R
2500|$|Freeman's {{common name}} comes from his {{extremely}} short stature - he was only [...] tall. However, his stocky build and strong fingers gave him great bowling stamina, and he hated being taken off. His height gave his deliveries a low trajectory that was difficult for batsmen to reach on the full toss. [...] This meant batsmen who did not play with a straight bat, or who lacked good footwork, rarely lasted long against him. [...] Freeman relied chiefly on a leg-break that pitched on middle-and-leg, so that batsmen had to play at it, and a top-spinner that was notoriously difficult to detect and brought him hundreds of wickets; the googly he used sparingly. His bowling grip was somewhat unorthodox for a leg spinner: being such a small man with small hands, <b>he</b> <b>gripped</b> the ball between thumb, middle and index fingers rather than the orthodox leg break grip between the palm, index finger and ring finger.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the last}} three months of the 1987 season, a finger on Gwynn's left hand would lock when <b>he</b> <b>gripped</b> a bat. It would come open barely enough for the bat to slip out from his grip. He had surgery on the hand during Spring {{training}} the following season. Early in 1988, Gwynn was on the DL for 21 days after spraining his thumb after tripping rounding first base in Pittsburgh. He was hitting [...]246 as late as July 2, 1988, but won the championship with a [...]313 average. Gwynn batted [...]406 in July and [...]367 in the last 73 games of the season. He denied that injuries impacted his hitting, instead attributing his struggles to [...] "mechanics". He struck out a career-high 40 times that season, while his [...]313 average was the lowest to win a title in NL history. In the 112 years before, only nine batting leaders hit below [...]330, the previous low being Larry Doyle's [...]320 in 1915. For the 25 years ending in 1988, batting leaders averaged [...]343. Gwynn hit 119 points higher with runners on base (.382) than with the bases empty (.263), the largest differential in the NL that season. He tied Pedro Guerrero for the highest average {{with runners in scoring position}} (.371). During the season, McKeon replaced Bowa as Padres manager, and moved Gwynn from right to center field. Gwynn also reached 1,000 career hits on April 22 with a single off Nolan Ryan of the Astros. On September 17, he passed Dave Winfield as the Padres career leader in hits with his 1,135th off Jim Acker of the Atlanta Braves.|$|E
2500|$|Like the batsmen the England bowlers {{were mostly}} old hands {{who had been}} playing before the war, {{unfortunately}} old bowlers rarely do well in Australia and they suffered. Bill Voce was a name well-known down under, he had been Harold Larwood's left-arm new-ball partner in the Bodyline series of 1932–33 and had taken 8/66 using the same tactics when the Australians played Notts in 1934. He was allowed on the [...] "Goodwill Tour" [...] of 1936–37 only after a public apology and took 17 wickets {{in the first two}} Tests to see England go 2–0 up in the series, but then he developed a muscle strain and Australia won the last three Tests. In 1946 he was 37 years old, the most senior England player after Hammond, but only a shadow of his former self. He failed to take a wicket in the Tests and was sidelined with a leg strain. Voce had been a spinner in his youth (until he saw Larwood bowl) and Hammond asked him to switch to slow bowling {{in the middle of the}} tour, but it was too late for him to change. Like Voce Dick Pollard was granted leave by the army to tour Australia, but was 34 years old, overweight and found that his swing bowling did not take to Australian conditions. He had taken 25 wickets (23.64) in the Victory Tests and was unlucky to not be chosen for a Test in the series, but still had some good seasons for Lancashire on his return home. The medium-fast bowling of Alec Bedser was reckoned to be the equal to that of Maurice Tate despite his poor figures, and he improved tremendously on tour. Making his debut against India at the age of 28 Bedser took 11/145 in his first Test and 11/93 in his second. In Australia he was overbowled and exhausted and found that his natural in-swingers were liked by Australian leg-side batsmen like Sid Barnes. To counter this <b>he</b> <b>gripped</b> the ball across the seam like a spinner and the result was an in-swinging leg-break which would take 30 wickets (16.03) on his return in 1950–51. Don Bradman wrote [...] "the ball with which Alec Bedser bowled me in the Adelaide Test Match was, I think, the finest ever to take my wicket. It must have come three-quarters of the way straight on my off-stump, then suddenly dipped in to pitch on the leg stump, only to turn off the pitch and hit the middle and off stumps." [...] Bedser would take 236 wickets in Tests (a record until 1963) and was the mainstay of the England bowling attack in the decade after the war. Bill Edrich was an enthusiastic fast bowler who could generate a fair pace off a short run up, but his greatest asset was a willingness to bowl. Nevertheless, he was given the new ball in the Second Test, returned the best figures (3/79) and top-scored in both innings with 71 and 119. Norman Yardley was one of the finds of the tour, a 'bits and pieces' all rounder called on to bowl due to the failings of others he dismissed Bradman three times in a row and proved to be a valuable support bowler.|$|E
