25|$|Belper's {{economy was}} {{traditionally}} reliant on manufacturing industry and numerous goods {{were made in}} the town. Cotton spinning and textile production were major employers virtually for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The large East Mill and the smaller North Mill are now all that remain of the industry and are preserved as part of the Derwent Valley Mills world heritage site. After the Second World War, J. W. Thornton, the chocolate maker, moved into the town from Sheffield, which helped to alleviate the <b>employment</b> <b>problems</b> arising from the contraction of the earlier industries. In recent years, the company completed a move to a new site a few miles away in Swanwick. Today, the main employment sectors are retail and services although some manufacturing industry remains. The main shopping area is centred on King Street. The town has two supermarkets, the Co-operative and Morrisons, and three discount shops, Poundland, B Bargains and the recently opened Aldi. The A6 road runs past the large redbrick Strutts Mill and on through the town's main through road, Bridge Street. On this street are the businesses of the Lion Hotel (an ancient coaching inn), an angling, gun and sports shop, a 24-hour petrol station, hairdressers and several restaurants.|$|E
