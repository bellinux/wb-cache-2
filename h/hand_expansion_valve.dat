40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} one component two-phase flow inside horizontal tubes, with bends using refrigerant R 600 a (Isobutane) as the working fluid. Two-phase refrigerant enters the evaporator and exits as a superheated vapour. As vapour quality increases with evaporation, the vapour velocity also increases causing increased interfacial tension forces and the two-phase flow experiences different flow patterns. The phase change flow patterns {{that occur in the}} tubular evaporator, which forms part of a typical refrigeration plant, were observed recorded and discussed here. The evaporator was a 16 -row trombone shaped transparent glass coil with return bends of 180 degrees and was connected to a refrigeration unit consisting of a hermetic compressor, air-cooled condenser, liquid receiver, and finally connected to a <b>hand</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve.</b> The effect of mineral oil on the flow patterns and behaviour at the transition zone together with several photographic and recording techniques were also discussed and reported here.

40|$|When an {{air source}} heat pump (ASHP) {{operates}} in heating mode, frost can be accumulated {{on the surface}} of its finned outdoor coil. Frosting deteriorates the operation and energy efficiency of the ASHP and periodic defrosting becomes necessary. Currently the most widely used standard defrosting method for ASHPs is reverse cycle defrost. On the other <b>hand,</b> electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> (EEVs) are commonly used in heat pump/refrigeration systems, including ASHP units, as throttle regulators of refrigerant flow. This paper reports on an experimental investigation of the performance of a reverse cycle defrost operation for a 6. 5. kW experimental heating capacity residential ASHP whose outdoor coil had four-parallel refrigerant circuits, and with an EEV as the refrigerant flow throttle regulator. The detailed descriptions of the experimental ASHP unit and the experimental procedures of ASHP are firstly presented. This is followed by reporting the comparative experiments of two control strategies for the EEV to investigate their effects on defrosting performance: the EEV being fully open and the EEV being regulated by a degree of refrigerant superheat (DS) controller. Experimental results revealed that when the EEV was regulated by the DS controller during defrosting, a higher defrosting efficiency and less heat wastage would be resulted in.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an approach for identifying critical model parameters in dynamic air-conditioning systems using limited sensor information. The <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> {{model and the}} compressor model parameters {{play a crucial role}} in the system model's accuracy. In the past, these parameters have been estimated using a mass flow meter; however, this is an expensive devise and at times, impractical. In response to these constraints, a novel method to estimate the unknown parameters of the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> model and the compressor model is developed. A gray box model obtained by augmenting the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> model, the evaporator model, and the compressor model is used. Two numerical search algorithms, nonlinear least squares and Simplex search, are used to estimate the parameters of the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> model and the compressor model. This parameter estimation is done by minimizing the error between the model output and the experimental systems output. Results demonstrate that the nonlinear least squares algorithm was more robust for this estimation problem than the Simplex search algorithm. In this thesis, two types of <b>expansion</b> <b>valves,</b> the Electronic <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valve</b> and the Thermostatic <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valve,</b> are considered. The Electronic <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valve</b> model is a static model due to its dynamics being much faster than the systems dynamics; the Thermostatic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> model, however, is a dynamic one. The parameter estimation algorithm developed is validated on two different experimental systems to confirm the practicality of its approach. Knowing the model parameters accurately can lead to a better model for control and fault detection applications. In addition to parameter estimation, this thesis also provides and validates a simple usable mathematical model for the Thermostatic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{method to}} {{determine}} the condensing temperature set point of air-cooled refrigeration system with an electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> was discussed in this paper. This set point is fixed for a specific system {{and is based on}} the flow characteristic of the installed electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> in variant opening and pressure drop. As common sense, at constant differential between condensing pressure and evaporating pressure, larger opening of <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> allows more refrigerant flowing through the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> into evaporator. This feature offers an opportunity to lower the condensing temperature via increasing opening of <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> to enhance refrigeration efficiency and in the same time designed cooling capacity can be maintained at low ambient temperature. In this case it is supposed that the installed electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve’s</b> capacity was larger than the evaporator’s, and in fact that occurs frequently in refrigeration system designing. The benefits of this method could include: the capacity of electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> is fully utilized, the refrigeration system will operate at a lower condensing pressure and the power consumption of compressor can decrease, hence the improvement of system efficiency is predictable...|$|R

40|$|The Vapor Compression Cycle (VCC) is the {{fundamental}} thermodynamic principle behind most Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems. HVACR systems account for {{a vast majority of}} the energy used in residential and commercial buildings. There is a growing need to make these VCC systems and their respective components more energy efficient. This thesis proposes a prototype pilot expansion device. Preliminary results have shown that this prototype <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> outperforms most of the expansion devices currently being used in HVACR applications. Valve hunting and superheat control are very important elements in the operation of <b>expansion</b> <b>valves.</b> They reduce system efficiency and increase energy consumption. To address these problems, the combination of conventional <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> with other <b>expansion</b> devices or components is still a relatively unexplored area. This approach has the potential to improve the energy efficiency of HVACR systems thus reducing cost of operation. This thesis discusses the development, design and proof-of-concept testing of a Prototype Pilot <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valve</b> (PPEV). A number of tests were designed and carried out in order to objectively compare the performance of the PPEV to that of an Electronic <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valve</b> (EEV) and a Thermal <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valve</b> (TEV) under a variety of operational conditions. These tests involve a superheat change test, startup test and external fluid flow rate test, all carried out at varying compressor speeds. The tests were carried out on a custom-built modulated water chiller system and a residential heat pump system. The results obtained from these tests validated that the PPEV performed significantly better than the EEV and the TEV. It was able to provide more cooling, better superheat control and consistently higher Coefficient of Performance (COP). In addition, this thesis also provides and proves the validity of a mathematical model for the Prototype Pilot <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valve.</b> Furthermore, an additional test was carried out to prove the possibility of an integrated design that will enable to PPEV to not rely on any external component to operate.
