40|$|Proceedings of the 1999 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 30 and 31, Athens, Georgia. Georgia has a {{tradition}} of "home rule," the principle of local management of local affairs. The State Constitution reinforces this tradition by giving local governments virtually autonomous control over local matters, including management of land use within their respective jurisdictions. Because of this tradition, local governments are used to minding their own business, not thinking about the broader, "statewide," consequences of their plans and actions, and not having much interference from outside governments (including the state) in management of land use and development within their jurisdictions. Since protection of critical water resources (and other environmentally sensitive areas) clearly requires appropriate management of land use and development in the vicinity of these resources, local governments must be enlisted in this effort. Yet the "home rule" provisions of the state constitution severely ties the state's hands in soliciting local government cooperation for resource protection. This is particularly problematic {{in light of the fact}} that 100 percent local government participation is required for effective protection of most water resources. For example, taking action to protect stream water quality will be ineffective if a single jurisdiction upstream is not doing its part to control pollutants. The passage of the Georgia Planning Act of 1989 marked the beginning of the state's attempt to work around "home rule" and enlist local governments to adopt land use regulations and other measures for protection of environmentally sensitive areas, including water resources. This legislation solicited local government cooperation by rewarding them for adopting comprehensive plans that meet state minimum requirements. The reward offered is continued eligibility for certain state grant and loan funds. Included among the state minimum requirements authorized in the Planning Act are standards for local· government protection critical environmental resources developed by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR). These standards are called the Environmental Planning Criteria, and they cover five types of environmental resources - wetlands, water supply watersheds, groundwater recharge areas, river corridors, and mountains. The Environmental Planning Criteria include specific measures that local governments must implement to protect any of these resources that lie within their 102 jurisdictions. These protection measures include such requirements as establishing buffers along streams, limiting density of residential development, restricting certain types of land uses, or limiting the percentage of impervious surfaces for new developments. In order to maintain eligibility for state grants and loans offered as reward for compliance with the Planning Act, local governments are required to adopt regulations that, at minimum, include the protection measures specified in the Environmental Planning Criteria, but it is not clear to what extent these regulations are actually being implemented and enforced by the local governments. Under current law, neither the Department of Community Affairs (DCA), which administers the Georgia Planning Act, nor DNR have any oversight authority over local enforcement of these regulations. The level of enforcement undoubtedly varies from community to community. With modest budgets and staffs, many smaller local governments are probably willing but unable to effectively carry out these regulations. Administering the zoning, subdivision regulations, or building codes programs necessary to put the required protection measures in place can be an expensive and staff-intensive proposition. Smaller local governments do have the option of sharing administration and enforcement responsibilities with other jurisdictions - to spread the costs. However, without enforcement oversight or other pressure from the state, it is unlikely that smaller local governments will pursue such alternatives, and actual implementation of the environmental protection measures will languish in many areas. One possible solution to this problem would be to formally establish an enforcement monitoring program within either DCA or DNR. This program could be empowered to provide technical assistance to local governments where needed and, as a last resort, recommend suspension of eligibility for state grant and loans for any local government that fails to demonstrate adequate <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> measures included in the Environmental Planning Criteria.

50|$|Until the 1980s, the Shanmugham Road was {{the literal}} marine drive with the Kochi Lake and the {{adjoining}} Arabian Sea to its west. In the 1980s, GCDA started the Kochi Marine Drive project (following from the Mumbai Marine Drive) and thus <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present Marine Drive (part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kochi Lake, west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shanmugham Road {{to the present}} Marine Walkway) was claimed from the Kochi Lake. <b>The</b> then plan <b>of</b> GCDA was to eventually construct a road on <b>the</b> western border <b>of</b> this land, which would thus become a literal marine drive. But due to <b>the</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Coastal <b>Protection</b> Laws in India in <b>the</b> 1990s, construction <b>of</b> a road became impossible. That's what led the GCDA toward settling down with a marine walkway instead of an actual marine drive.

40|$|The Supreme Courts current doctrinal rules {{governing}} racial discrimination {{and affirmative action}} are unsatisfying. They often seem artificial, internally inconsistent, and even conceptually incoherent. Despite a long and continuing history of racial discrimination in the United States, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problems with the Supreme Courts racial jurisprudence stem from the Courts willingness to view <b>the</b> current distribution <b>of</b> societal resources as establishing a colorblind, race-neutral baseline {{that can be used}} to make equality determinations. As a result, the current rules are as likely to facilitate racial discrimination as to prevent it, or to remedy <b>the</b> lingering effects <b>of</b> past discrimination. Because <b>the</b> Equal <b>Protection</b> Clause contains few judicially manageable standards for distinguishing between constitutional imperatives and legislative policy preferences, the Supreme Court should normally defer to the representative branches for <b>the</b> formulation <b>of</b> prudent racial policies. However, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s insulation from immediate political pressure may give the Court greater relative institutional competence than the representative branches in making one type of determination that is relevant to <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Equal <b>Protection</b> Clause. Utilizing its power of judicial review, theCourt could disqualify from constitutional cognizance non-remedial equality arguments that were not being asserted with good faith sincerity.

In addition, an objective standard of good faith could be used to reject arguments whose unconscious racial motivations were revealed by contemporary theories of cognitive dissonance and implicit bias.

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{my thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship between legal protections of minority shareholders – ‘on the books’ and ‘in action’ – and <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> equity markets. In this regard, {{there is a general}} consensus that Russian legal measures adopted to protect minority shareholders are strong. <b>The</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judiciary to enforce these measures is <b>the</b> principal focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic criticism and has been frequently cited to explain <b>the</b> underdevelopment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian equity market. Notably, <b>the</b> criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judiciary persists despite the market’s marked improvements over the last decade. And yet there has been little empirical analysis <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minority shareholder <b>protections</b> by Russian judiciary. This thesis examines private <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> corporate law in Russia focusing on the lawsuits to impugn transactions with corporate insiders and <b>the</b> outcomes <b>of</b> those suits. Drawing on a dataset of 170 cases decided by the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Moscow region in 1999 – 2006, the thesis finds that a large proportion of claimants are unsuccessful. Relying primarily on the law and economics literature and theoretical accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the law and market development, the thesis develops an analytical framework (for convenience termed judicial bias hypothesis) against which it evaluates case outcomes. The evaluation suggests that in a substantial fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases the outcomes were justified by legislation or by efficiency, casting doubt over <b>the</b> criticisms <b>of</b> Russian judiciary. While cautious in drawing causal links between the enforcement and markets, the thesis suggests that marginalising legal institutions’ role in Russia might be premature. Their role in fostering the market might be greater than anticipated particularly in incentivising disclosure if not in deterring overreaching...|$|R
40|$|Use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{representative}} parties rule in England and Australia {{has been}} stifled by restrictive interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{circumstances in which}} it is available. Chapter 1 demonstrates that the predominant test in England for the 'same interest' required by the rule would, if consistently applied, defeat any claim to use the rule. <b>The</b> recent change <b>of</b> test in Australia widens the rule's potential scope but {{does not appear to have}} resulted in significantly more liberal interpretation. Chapter 2 discusses the rule's operation, including res judicata, <b>the</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> judgments, and <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> those represented and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> named parties. It concludes that the rule diverges from <b>the</b> traditional model <b>of</b> individual voluntary civil litigation, and is characterised by uncertainty. Chapter 3 argues that this uncertainty may have encouraged a defensive posture by the courts, limiting use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rule and avoiding the need to address those issues which demand resolution. Chapter 4 notes that various features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rule undermine a number of principles commonly associated with procedural fairness. It is argued that judicial response to these features often pays insufficient attention to two issues. The first is whether the purpose which the principle is expected to promote is in fact protected by the rule, even if the principle itself is undermined. The second is the need to balance <b>the</b> rule's limitation <b>of</b> some principles against its particular benefits. It is further argued that some successful representative claims exemplify circumstances in which <b>the</b> primary purpose <b>of</b> procedural law (accurate application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substantive law) is served by the rule.
