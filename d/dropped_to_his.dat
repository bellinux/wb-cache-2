5|$|Between {{the first}} and second falls, Barr began to mockingly perform jumping jacks in the ring, showing how little {{physical}} exertion it took to win the first fall. This was followed by Guerrero once again mocking the Mexican crowd by pretending to be swimming to infuriate the crowd. Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out the second fall as they had the first, locking up {{in the center of the}} ring. When Octagón entered the ring, Guerrero <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> knees, feigning an apology for a moment, before poking Octagón in the eye to gain the advantage. Later on, Hijo del Santo entered the ring and all four men ended up in the ring at the same time, until the tecnico team sent La Pareja del Terror to the floor, followed by a double Topé Suicida (Suicide dive headbutt) by Hijo del Santo and Octagón. Later in the match, Guerrero performed a Huracanrana with Hijo del Santo sitting on the top rope and gained a pinfall, leaving Octagón at a disadvantage in the second fall. Barr and Guerrero double-teamed Octagón, with Barr throwing Octagón up on the air, thinking Guerrero caught him for a move. Instead, Octagón rolled up Guerrero for the pinfall as Barr celebrated, mistakenly thinking Guerrero got the pinfall. Moments later, the unsuspecting Barr was rolled up into Octagón's trademark submission hold La Escalera and was forced to submit, tying the match at one fall each.|$|E
25|$|Half-Wits Holiday (released 1947) {{would be}} Curly's final {{appearance}} {{as an official}} member of the Stooges. During filming on May 6, 1946, Curly suffered a severe stroke while sitting in director Jules White's chair, waiting to film the last scene of the day. When Curly was called by the assistant director to take the stage, he did not answer. Moe went looking for his brother: he found Curly with his head <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> chest. Moe later recalled that his mouth was distorted and {{he was unable to}} speak, only cry. Moe quietly alerted White to all this, leading the latter to rework the scene quickly, dividing the action between Moe and Larry while Curly was rushed to the hospital, where Moe joined him after the filming. Curly spent several weeks at the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California before returning home for further recuperation.|$|E
25|$|On 22 March 2001, {{tensions}} soared {{further in}} Tetovo, when two Albanian men, {{a father and}} a son, were shot dead during a routine search at a police checkpoint. The incident began when the car was stopped and a police officer saw the younger Albanian move something in his pocket. Fearing it was a grenade the officer panicked and ran. The Albanian exited the car, <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> knees, and threw the grenade {{in the direction of the}} running policeman. It landed at his feet but failed to explode. At the moment the grenade was thrown, a cordon of Macedonian troops, positioned behind sandbags, unleashed a volley of gunfire at the Albanian. At first he slumped against the car, then fell on the curb, dead. Moments later the father was also shot as he tried to run from the car. Witnesses later interviewed insisted the father and son died with mobile phones in their hands, claiming that the pair were victims of revenge by police.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in 1886, Williamson {{switched}} his fielding {{position to}} shortstop, while the Chicago White Stockings again won the National League championship, their fifth in seven years. [...] The team's success did not coincide with Williamson's slide in seasonal numbers. [...] His batting average <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> career low of [...]216, and his strikeouts jumped up {{to a career}} high of 71, in 430at bats, although he did finish third in bases on balls. [...] The White Stockings met the St. Louis Browns following the season and agreed to play a best of seven [...] "World Series" [...] {{for the second consecutive}} year. [...] The Browns won the series, four games to two, and Williamson's statistics for the series did not improve. In fact, they were worse than in 1885. [...] He gathered one base hit in 18at bats, for a [...]056batting average, and scored two runs.|$|E
500|$|Large crowds {{gathered}} outside Newgate on Monday; {{a force of}} troops stood by, since warnings had been received of a [...] "Rescue Bellingham" [...] movement. The crowd was calm and restrained, as was Bellingham when he appeared at the scaffold shortly before 8 o'clock. Hodgson records that Bellingham mounted the steps [...] "with the utmost celerity... his tread was bold and firm... no indication of trembling, faltering, or irresolution appeared". Bellingham was then blindfolded, the rope fastened, and a final prayer was said by the chaplain. As the clock struck eight the trap door was released, and Bellingham <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> death. Cobbett, still incarcerated in Newgate, observed the crowd's reactions: [...] "anxious looks... half-horrified countenances... mournful tears... unanimous blessings". In accordance with the court's sentence, the body was cut down and sent to St Bartholomew's Hospital for dissection. In what the press described as [...] "morbid sensationalism", Bellingham's clothes were sold for high prices {{to members of the}} public.|$|E
500|$|At No Way Out, Big Show made {{a return}} to the company after taking time off for {{injuries}} beginning in December 2006. In his return promotional interview, Big Show threatened to give Rey Mysterio a chokeslam. Professional boxer and WBC Welterweight Champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., who was in attendance and a close friend of Mysterio's, came to his aid and confronted Big Show. After Big Show <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> knees, Mayweather attacked him with a combination of punches, which caused Big Show to bleed from the nose and mouth. The following night on Raw, Big Show challenged Mayweather to a wrestling match, which Mayweather accepted. As part of the storyline, Big Show arranged an exhibition match with fighter Brandon Hill, who was similar in size and stature to Mayweather. Unimpressed with Show's display of dominance over Hill, Mayweather told Show that [...] "at WrestleMania, I'm going to break your jaw". At their weigh-in for their WrestleMania match, Show threw Mayweather into a crowd of wrestlers to emphasise the disparity in size.|$|E

2500|$|After {{recording}} the final out, Orosco threw his glove {{high in the}} air and immediately <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> knees while catcher Gary Carter ran out to the mound to embrace him {{with the rest of the}} team following. A famous photo of the celebration was taken by Mets photographer George Kalinsky. For many years, this was the final scene shown during the ending credits of the syndicated Major League Baseball news show This Week in Baseball, and was replaced in 1992 by the final out of the division-clinching victory by the Atlanta Braves in 1991. [...] And then, the song: [...] "Success" [...] by The Weather Girls was played.|$|E
2500|$|Tibthorpe {{did not run}} as {{a two-year-old}} but showed {{a great deal of}} promise in training: {{according}} to one story Bill Scott dismounted after an early gallop and <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> knees to thank God [...] "that he has sent me a bloody clinker at last". In early 1846 the name of Tibthorpe began to appear in the betting lists for The Derby: after being quoted at odds of 100/1 in late January, he was backed down to 25/1 over the next month. Tibthorpe made his first racecourse appearance in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on 28 April, starting at odds of 5/1 in a field of six runners. Bill Scott produced a [...] "perfect" [...] display of jockeyship to win a slowly run race on his own horse, foiling a major gamble on a horse named Tom Tulloch. Tibthorpe's appearance and performance led to suspicions of foul play. During this period there were several cases of four-year-old horses having their identities faked and running in races, notably the British Classics, which were confined to three-year-olds. Tibthorpe's win at Newmarket was only confirmed after an examination of his teeth, demanded by Tom Tulloch's owner Lord Maidstone, which established that he was indeed a three-year-old colt. The Yorkshire-trained horse was promoted to second favourite for the Derby, and Scott renamed him after Sir Tatton Sykes, 4th Baronet a notable breeder of Thoroughbreds based at Sledmere.|$|E
