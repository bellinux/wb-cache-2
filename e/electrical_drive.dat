40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of desired work inside the long tunnel drilling, rating of <b>electrical</b> <b>drives</b> at tunnel face has significantly increased. Due to the high rating concentration of <b>electrical</b> <b>drives</b> at tunnel face significant voltage must be required which is need of an hour to finish the work in given time interval and to avoid the various dangers. Therefore, planning of electrical power distribution is required and voltage drop across each <b>electrical</b> <b>drives</b> must be taken into account. While power planning drill machine, Armored Face Conveyors (AFC), Shearer, breaker, Stage loader, face lightning, etc. must be given due importance as starting power required to them is very high. Breakaway torque of the AFC is not maintained because of low power, so it is required to start constantly requiring high power as well as it will heat the environment, which is often hazardous. In order to provide the required power drop and reduce the dangers, some alternative methods must be used. In the present investigation voltage drop compensation technique is developed by providing with optimization of position of transformer. Even though the voltage drop cannot be maintained in such cases boosting transformer with the power thyristor with tap changing is used to control the power instead of tap changer mechanism. In order to operate the various drives in long drilling tunnel and finish the work in desired period one must know the various parameters involved in the system. On line parameter such as voltage, currents, temperature, etc. of <b>electrical</b> <b>drives</b> and environment are measured through PC using various sensors, the sensed data is compared with the standard data. The comparison will help to take necessary decision and helps to reduce the forth-coming dangers in the tunnel or <b>electrical</b> <b>drives...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract:-Simplified active NPC (ANPC) {{inverters}} {{enable a}} substantially increased output power and an improved performance at zero speed for high-power <b>electrical</b> <b>drives.</b> This paper analyzes {{the operation of}} Simplified ANPC inverters under device failure conditions, and proposes the fault-tolerant strategies to enable continuous operating of the inverters and drive systems under single device open- and short-failure conditions. Therefore, the reliability and robustness of the <b>electrical</b> <b>drives</b> are greatly improved. Moreover, the proposed solution adds no additional components to standardANPC inverters; thus, the cost for robust operation of drives is lower. Simulation results are provided for verification. Furthermore, a comprehensive comparison for the reliability function of ANPC and NPC inverters is presented. The results show that ANPC inverters have higher reliability than NPC inverters. Two inverters have similar reliability for device open failure, while ANPC inverters have higher reliability than NPC inverters for device short failure. Therefore the input voltage is renewable energy and is rectified to DC using rectifier circuit and stored in the Battery.

Variable speed drives are the major part of power system, microelectronic, power plant and so on. Conventional controlling methods of <b>electrical</b> <b>drives</b> needed mathematical model of control process which was very tedious, that problem is solved by artificial intelligence which contains both hard computation and soft computation. Artificial intelligence has found high application in most nonlinear systems same as motor drive. As no mathematical model is needed for artificial intelligent system so efficiency and reliability of drives increase and volume, weight and cost of drives decrease. Soft starters are widely used with electronic motor as it provides improved operating characteristics and better control. Soft starter also reduces the wear and tear effects on motor and their associated drive systems which in turn reduces maintenance, conserve energy and plays a significant part in improving system performance so the escalators, pumps, elevators and conveyor belts can be operated more effectively with soft starter...|$|R
