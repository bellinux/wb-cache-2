40|$|AbstractThe Formula SAE is an {{international}} competition for vehicle fully designed and built by students from worldwide Universities. The engine and vehicle design in the Formula SAE competition has {{to comply with a}} strict regulation. Regarding the engine <b>intake</b> <b>line</b> an air restrictor of circular cross-section no greater than 20 mm must be fitted between the throttle valve and the engine inlet. The aim of the throat is to limit the engine air flow rate as it strongly influences the volumetric efficiency and then the maximum power. The present paper is focused on the design of the engine intake system of the Firenze Race Team vehicle in order to optimize its performance in terms of both the maximum power and the drivability of the vehicle. One of the typical solutions for limiting the air restrictor influence consists of a plenum chamber placed along the <b>intake</b> <b>line</b> downstream of the restrictor. However the plenum involves also a delay in the engine response during the transient phases. The greater is the plenum, the lower are the power losses but the greater is the engine response delay. Taking advantage of a calibrated 1 D model of the engine and a simplified vehicle model, the authors numerically analyzed an innovative solution that is constituted by a variable length duct inside the plenum. When the duct is at the maximum extension, the plenum is excluded from the <b>intake</b> <b>line</b> improving the engine response time.

40|$|AbstractThe vast {{majority}} of today's cars remain powered by gasoline or Diesel engines. In the European market, Diesel cars accounts for 55 % of all new registrations while gasoline cars for 44 %. All the other technologies such as hybrids, fully electric or natural gas and ethanol powered cars combine {{to make up the}} remaining 1 %. Despite the publicity on these highly anticipated alternative technologies, statistics indicate that their usage remains marginal when compared to more ‘traditional’ powertrains. The internal combustion engine remains the principal way of transportation, at least for the foreseeable years. That being said, undesirable emissions (HC, CO, NOx, PM) are today's major concern because of their negative impact on air quality and global warming. The latest Euro 6 standard limits the CO emissions on a gasoline engine to 68 % and the PM (particulate matter) on a Diesel engine to 96 % lower than those established in 1992. CO 2 emissions which are directly proportional to consumption rates are recently added to the list with a target of 95 g/Km for 2020. The main trend for solving these issues is through engine downsizing with high rates of turbocharging accompanied by fuel injection control, after-treatment and system integration. Techniques that increment the energy saving costs. The ICCT (International Council on Clean Transportation) estimates that the cost of taking a 4 -cylinder 1. 5 L Diesel engine from no emission controls to the Euro 6 standard is around US$ 1400. A major technique to gain control of the engine processes and achieve high performance and low emission levels is through air handling depicted by air intake tuning, turbocharging tuning and charge air cooling. This article briefly describes the air <b>intake</b> <b>line</b> of 4 -cylinder 1. 5 L turbocharged Diesel engine and investigates the role of wave action phenomena on its <b>intake</b> <b>line.</b> The goal here is to achieve lower consumption and better performance by finding the optimal intake geometry. The latter comprises of a compressor wheel, a water cooled charge air cooler prototype (WCAC) and connecting pipes. The wave action effects were first explained and highlighted on a dynamic flow bench at “Mann+Hummel” using a frequency modeling approach which enabled to find the optimal length of piping upstream and downstream of the WCAC. Next this length was experimentally verified by mounting the different length on an engine test bench and registering pressure wave amplitudes. Finally the pressure recordings were fed to engine simulation software GT-PowerTM for a transient low speed simulation mimicking urban driving conditions and specific fuel consumption data were recovered. The result is a proposed air <b>intake</b> <b>line</b> for a turbocharged engine with a water cooled charge air cooler design choice.

40|$|Nowadays {{stringent}} emission {{regulations are}} pushing towards new air management strategies like LP-EGR and HP/LP mix both for passenger car and heavy duty applications, increasing the engine control complexity. Within {{a project in}} collaboration between Kohler Engines EMEA, Politecnico di Torino, Ricardo and Denso to exploit the potential of EGR-Only technologies, a 3. 4 liters KDI 3404 was equipped with a two stage turbocharging system, an extremely high pressure FIS and a low pressure EGR system. The LP-EGR system works in a closed loop control with an intake oxygen sensor actuating two valves: an EGR valve placed downstream of the EGR cooler that regulates the flow area of the bypass between the exhaust line and the <b>intake</b> <b>line,</b> and an exhaust flap to generate enough backpressure to recirculate the needed EGR rate to cut the NOx emission without a specific aftertreatment device. In this paper it will be demonstrated how, using a 1 D-CFD code to characterize the flow in the exhaust line and in the EGR pathway, together with simple physical correlations, {{it is possible to}} define the opening laws of the two valves in order to both obtain a linear response of the EGR control and minimize the fuel consumption increase due to the backpressure valve...|$|E

40|$|Exhaust gas {{recirculation}} (EGR) is extensively employed in diesel combustion engines to achieve nitrogen oxides emission targets. The EGR is often cooled {{in order to}} increase the effectiveness of the strategy, even though this leads to a further undesired impact on particulate matter and hydrocarbons. Experimental tests were carried out on a diesel engine at a dynamometer rig under steady-state speed and load working conditions that were considered relevant for the New European Driving Cycle.

All the relevant engine parameters were acquired along EGR trade-off curves, in order to perform a detailed comparison of the two coolers. The effect of intake throttling operation on increasing the EGR ratio was also investigated.

The EGR mass flow-rate dependence on the pressure and temperature upstream of the turbine as well as the pressure downstream of the EGR control valve was modeled by means of the expression for convergent nozzles.

40|$|The {{engine and}} vehicle design in Formula SAE {{competition}} has {{to accomplish a}} strict regulation. In order to limit the maximum power, an air restrictor of 20 mm of diameter is imposed in the <b>intake</b> <b>line.</b> To overcome the limitations caused by the restrictor, Firenze Race Team equipped its one-cylinder engine with a turbocharger, which is conventionally provided with a wastegate (WG) valve to limit the maximum boost pressure and avoid knocking phenomena. Typically, the WG valve is controlled by a pneumatic actuator, which opens the valve according to a defined and constant maximum boost pressure downstream the compressor in the whole engine operating range. Therefore, the boost pressure at high engine speed, in which knocking problems are less intense and the volumetric efficiency is lower, {{is limited by the}} threshold value defined at medium-low engine speeds, i. e. the pneumatic WG limits the maximum power that the engine can supply. In this study, the implementation of an electronic control system for the WG valve is described together with a dedicated control strategy aimed at providing the desired boost pressure at full load for each engine speed, {{in order to get the}} maximum power avoiding knocking phenomena. The electronic WG provided higher power values and a more extended torque curve in comparison to the conventional pneumatic one...|$|E
40|$|National audienceIn {{order to}} {{increase}} the volumetric efficiency of downsized engines, turbochargers may be used. They allow the increase of the intake pressure and {{are associated with a}} charge air cooler (CAC). The main disadvantage of a downsized turbocharged engine (compared to a naturally aspirated one) is the deterioration of low-end torque caused by the lack of enthalpy of the exhaust gas at low engine speed and load. To investigate this issue, the <b>intake</b> <b>line</b> of a turbocharged Diesel engine was analyzed, focusing on the pressure waves at the inlet [1] [2] which are most often overlooked on these engines in favor of pressure loss reduction. A first step of the study is to identify the potential resonance for the establishment of standing waves at low engine speeds. Experimental tests with different pipe lengths upstream and downstream of the charge air cooler (CAC) were performed on an electrically driven engine test bench (pulse generator). This was done to study the influence of pressure waves on the air filling of the engine and determine the optimal length of the air circuit. In a second step, and to better understand the dynamic phenomena at the intake, the reflection coefficient at the interface of the CAC is calculated (method of pressure wave decomposition) from measurements on the engine test bench (with combustion). This allows to characterize the unsteady behavior of this element and to better discern the influence of the upstream and downstream ducts on engine filling. Finally, a new active system is proposed, it consists of a long pipe designed for acoustic tuning (low end torque) and a short pipe to minimize losses (high speed power generation). The acoustic response of this element is compared to that obtained with an equivalent length of straight pipe on the dynamic bench [3]...|$|E
40|$|Pig {{breeding}} programs worldwide {{continue to}} focus on both productivity and robustness. This selection emphasis has to be accompanied by provision of better-quality environments to pigs to improve performance and to enhance health and welfare of pigs. Definition of broader breeding objectives that include robustness traits in addition to production traits {{is the first step in}} the development of selection strategies for productivity and robustness. An approach has been presented which facilitates extension of breeding objectives. Post-weaning survival, maternal genetic effects for growth as an indicator of health status and sow mature weight are examples of robustness traits. Further, breeding objectives should be defined for commercial environments and selection indexes should account for genotype by environment interactions (GxE). Average performances of groups of pigs have been used to quantify the additive effects of multiple environmental factors on performance of pigs. For growth, GxE existed when environments differed by 60 g/day between groups of pigs. This environmental variation was observed even on well managed farms. Selection for improved health of pigs should focus on disease resistance to indirectly reduce pathogen loads on farms and on disease resilience to improve the ability of pigs to cope with infection challenges. Traits defining disease resiliencemaybe based on performance andimmune measures, disease incidence or survival rates of pigs. Residual feed intake is a trait that quantifies feed efficiency. The responses of divergent selection lines for residual feed intake to various environmental challenges were often similar or even favourable for the more efficient, low residual feed <b>intake</b> <b>line.</b> These somewhat unexpected results highlight the need to gain a better understanding of the metabolic differences between more or less productive pigs.

The aim of the TCI is to independently measure ambient air in parallel to the standard station instrumentation, thus providing a comprehensive comparison that includes the sample intake system, the instrument itself as well as its calibration and data evaluation. Observed differences between the TCI and the Heidelberg gas chromatographic system, which acted as a reference for the TCI, were − 0. 02 ± 0. 08 μmol mol − 1 for CO 2 and − 0. 3 ± 2. 3 nmol mol − 1 for CH 4. Over a period of two weeks each, the continuous CO 2 and CH 4 measurements at two ICOS field stations, Cabauw and OPE, were compared to co-located TCI measurements. At Cabauw mean differences of 0. 21 ± 0. 06 μmol mol − 1 for CO 2 and 0. 41 ± 0. 50 nmol mol − 1 for CH 4 were found. For OPE the mean differences were 0. 13 ± 0. 07 μmol mol − 1 for CO 2 and 0. 44 ± 0. 36 nmol mol − 1 for CH 4.

The combined use of a low-oxide interface setup, along with high-gain Faraday amplifiers with a 1012 Ω resistor, enabled precise determination of Sr isotope ratios from 50 - 100 μm diameter craters at 10 Hz laser repetition rate. Residual analytical biases of 84 Sr/ 86 Sr and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios, obtained from Kr baseline suppressions (Kimura et al., 2013, Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry, 28, 945 - 957), {{were found to be}} nonlinear, but the correction method was applicable to 50 - 200 μm/ 10 Hz craters. We also found that the 85 Rb/ 87 Rb overlap correction factor changed with time with a change in the surface condition of the sampler-skimmer cones. The correction factor of 85 Rb/ 87 Rb was thus determined at least once per five unknown measurements using the Aridus solution <b>intake</b> <b>line.</b> We determined 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios from MkAn anorthite (Sr = 305 ppm, Rb = 0. 07 ppm), BHVO- 2 G, KL 2 -G, ML 3 B-G (Sr = 312 - 396 ppm, Rb = 5. 8 - 9. 2 ppm), and BCR- 2 G (Sr = 337 ppm, Rb = 48. 5 ppm) basalt glasses using a 50 - 100 μm/ 10 Hz crater.

Nevertheless, one of the disadvantageous of diesel engines {{is related to the}} difficulties for starting at cold conditions, particularly in the conditions where the ambient temperature is near or below 0 ºC. Additionally, the harmful exhaust emissions are also at significantly important levels during the cold start conditions. Most of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from diesel engines are produced during the engine warm-up period.   In order to improve cold start characteristics of diesel engines, many measures have been proposed, such as glow plugs and air heaters in air <b>intake</b> <b>lines.</b> In this study, in order to increase the cold start performance and improve the exhaust emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine, phase change materials (PCMs) have been used. PCMs have high heats of fusion and they can absorb latent energy before melting. During the phase change, temperature of PCMs remains nearly constant. In this study, a PCMs was used with the 45 - 51 ºC melting temperature band in a heat exchanger. Hot water from an external source was circulated in the exchanger to carry out the experiments in the same conditions and was used as heat source in order to melt the PCMs. Engine intake air has been passed through the exchanger before engine intake manifold.   During the engine cooling period, the PCM in the produced heat exchanger have increased the cooling time period of engine intake air. An experimental setup has been established to observe the cold start characteristics of the two cylinder diesel engine with and without using the produced exchanger. Temperature measurements from different points, CO exhaust emissions, engine speed and in cylinder pressure measurements have been used to evaluate the contribution of exchanger and increasing the intake air temperature by using the PCMs. The experiments have been carried out at different PCMs and ambient temperatures. The increase in the temperature of intake air at low ambient temperatures assists the engine cold start performance, decreases the starting time of engine and improves the engine exhaust emissions characteristics...|$|R

However, NPY inhibited and leptin stimulated intake if the solution was infused intraorally. Thus NPY stimulates the responses used to obtain food but inhibits those used to consume food, and leptin has the opposite effects. To test the specificity of these responses the sexual behavior of male rats was examined. NPY-treated males showed minor deficits in sexual behavior but chose to ingest a sucrose solution rather than copulate with a female if offered the choice. By contrast, leptin-treated males ingested little sucrose and displayed an increase in ejaculatory frequency if given the same choice.

The procedure used was to spray the size-fractionated but otherwise untreated clay-water suspensions into ultra-cold pentane in a stainless teel beaker (Sctmettler, Monfforte & Rhodes, 1967). The pentane was constantly stirred during the process. The beaker and pentane were cooled by submersion i a dry-ice acetone bath. The suspensions were sprayed through a drawn glass nozzle attached to a beaker of clay suspension by tygon tubing. An <b>intake</b> air <b>line</b> supplied pressure for spraying and allowed the flow rate to be regulated. The suspensions froze instantaneously upon contact with the pentane. The concentration f the suspensions was arbitrarily set at 0. 25 weight percent clay...|$|R
40|$|Previous work {{examining}} the transcriptome of steer tissue samples from animals with divergent gain {{have shown a}} relationship with the expression of genes with functions in immune and inflammatory pathways. The process of mounting an immune or inflammatory response is energetically expensive and variation in cytokine responses may affect cattle production traits. In addition, a previous study has identified variation in the transcript abundance of numerous genes, including the cytokine gene IL 6 ST, in the circulating white blood cells of pigs associated with high and low residual feed <b>intake</b> (RFI) <b>lines.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether changes in cytokine expression in the circulating white blood cells (WBC) could also be associated with body weight gain in beef steers. Crossbred steers (n = 12) with average feed intake (10. 9 kg/d), but divergent body weight gain (Low = 1. 92 kg/d; High = 2. 25 kg/d), were selected for the study. The genes CCR 3, IL 9 R, PF 4, NAMPT and TNF were associated with gain (P≤ 0. 05); and CSF 1, IL 2 RG, IL 6 ST, CCL 3, and TNFSF 13 B displayed a trend towards association with gain (P 3 ̆c 0. 1). The expression of cytokine genes in circulating WBCs may be useful indicators of production traits in cattle...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Increased food {{consumption}} following Δ 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol-induced cannabinoid type 1 receptor agonism is well documented. However, possible non-Δ 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol phytocannabinoid-induced feeding effects {{have yet to}} be fully investigated. Therefore, we have assessed the effects of the individual phytocannabinoids, cannabigerol, cannabidiol and cannabinol, upon feeding behaviors. Methods: Adult male rats were treated (p. o.) with cannabigerol, cannabidiol, cannabinol or cannabinol plus the CB 1 R antagonist, SR 141716 A. Prior to treatment, rats were satiated and food intake recorded following drug administration. Data were analyzed for hourly intake and meal microstructure. Results: Cannabinol induced a CB 1 R-mediated increase in appetitive behaviors via significant reductions in the latency to feed and increases in consummatory behaviors via increases in meal 1 size and duration. Cannabinol also significantly increased the intake during hour 1 and total chow consumed during the test. Conversely, cannabidiol significantly reduced total chow consumption over the test period. Cannabigerol administration induced no changes to feeding behavior. Conclusion: This is the first time cannabinol has been shown to increase feeding. Therefore, cannabinol could, in the future, provide an alternative to the currently used and psychotropic Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol-based medicines since cannabinol is currently considered to be non-psychotropic. Furthermore, cannabidiol reduced food <b>intake</b> in <b>line</b> with some existing reports, supporting the need for further mechanistic and behavioral work examining possible anti-obesity effects of cannabidiol...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{balance is}} {{critical}} for cells to maintain at homeostasis as disturbances in it can disrupt cellular function and consequently the physiology of an organism. Fluid loss for an organism can be classified as either intra- or extracellular, {{and it appears that}} different mechanisms have developed to restore homeostasis after intra- or extracellular dehydration. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) {{has been shown to be}} an important mediator of extracellular dehydration induced fluid <b>intake.</b> Various <b>lines</b> of evidence have demonstrated the importance of the subfornical organ (SFO) to mediate fluid intake, especially due to the RAS, and we have shown that production and action of angiotensin (ANG) at the SFO is necessary for fluid intake due to ANG within the brain. Protein kinase C (PKC), specifically PKC-a;, is shown to be a necessary and sufficienty sufficient effector in the SFO to mediate brain angiotensin-II (ANG-II) polydipsia. It is also demonstrated that production of ANG from the SFO is sufficient to increase fluid intake through the ANG-II type 1 (AT 1 R) receptor and PKC. While production of ANG from the SFO is sufficient to increase fluid intake it is not sufficient to increase blood pressure, metabolism, or sodium appetite. Thus, production and action of ANG to activate PKC-a; is both necessary and sufficient to increase fluid intake at the SFO, and the fluid, pressor, and metabolic phenotypes of brain ANG through the SFO can be separated...|$|R
