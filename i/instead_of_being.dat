5|$|An Australian {{teenager}} {{was charged}} with four counts of inciting other hackers to impair electronic communications and two of unauthorised access to restricted data {{for his role in}} the attack.

During the first hunt {{of the season in}} Taiji in 2009, an estimated 50 Pilot Whales and 100 Bottlenose Dolphins were captured. Although all the Pilot Whales were killed, and 30 Bottlenose Dolphins were taken for use in dolphinariums, the 70 remaining animals were set free again <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> killed for consumption.|$|E

5|$|Demolition {{began in}} August 1967. The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Nordman Construction after an unsuccessful tender process. The company brought in the Magnus II, a floating crane with a lifting capacity of 400tons, which could remove {{all but two of}} the spans. These longer spans were pulled sideways off the piers, expecting that they would break into manageable pieces under their own weight. They proved stronger than this and remained intact, needing to be broken up in the river, with much sinking into the bed <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> recovered.|$|E
5|$|In John (18:1–11), Jesus {{does not}} pray to be spared his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as {{scarcely}} touched by such human weakness. The people who arrest him are Roman soldiers and Temple guards. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> betrayed by a kiss, Jesus proclaims his identity, {{and when he}} does, the soldiers and officers fall to the ground. The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, and Jesus rebukes him for it.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten glass {{is very important}} for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> drawn out into a fiber.|$|E
5|$|In {{her later}} works, such as A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), Wollstonecraft {{repeatedly}} {{returns to the}} topics addressed in Thoughts, particularly the virtue {{of hard work and}} the imperative for women to learn useful skills. Wollstonecraft suggests that the social and political life of the nation would greatly improve if women were to acquire valuable skills <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> mere social ornaments.|$|E

5|$|K-TAG was {{introduced}} in 1995; the system was internally designed and is internally run, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> contracted to another company, saving additional overhead costs. The Kansas Turnpike is completely self-sustaining. All costs {{are paid for by}} the tolls collected; no tax money is used for construction, maintenance, or administration. KTA estimates that 120,000 drivers use the turnpike each day.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E

5|$|Octopus blood {{contains}} the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very viscous {{and it requires}} considerable pressure to pump it round the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed 75 mmHg. In cold conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than haemoglobin. The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> carried within blood cells, and gives the blood a bluish colour.|$|E

5|$|One month into World War II, the Royal Navy {{battleship}} HMS Royal Oak was sunk by a German U-boat in Scapa Flow. As {{a result}} barriers were built to close {{most of the}} access channels; these had the additional advantage of creating causeways enabling travellers to go from island to island by road <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> obliged to rely on ferries. The causeways were constructed by Italian prisoners of war, who also constructed the ornate Italian Chapel. The Scapa Flow base was run down after the war, eventually closing in 1957.|$|E
