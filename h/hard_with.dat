5|$|By 1959, {{more than}} 1,000 homes a year were being constructed. By the late 1970s, the {{economic}} growth was over for both downtown and local businesses and industries. The farm crisis of the 1980s hit Davenport {{and the rest of}} the Quad Cities <b>hard,</b> <b>with</b> high unemployment and financial hardships. 35,000 workers lost their jobs throughout the entire Quad Cities area. The Caterpillar Plant on the cities north side closed, causing many jobs to be lost.|$|E
5|$|Having {{acquired}} major personal {{success and}} pop culture influence playing John McClane in Die Hard, Willis reprised {{his role in}} the sequels Die Hard 2 (1990) and Die <b>Hard</b> <b>with</b> a Vengeance (1995). These first three installments in the Die Hard series grossed over US$700 million internationally and propelled Willis to the first rank of Hollywood action stars.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena purpureofusca grow singly or in {{clusters}} on the decaying wood of conifers, particularly spruce, pine, and Douglas-fir. It is commonly found on decaying pine cones. In a European study, the fungus was found growing on logs {{in a state}} of decay where the wood was mostly <b>hard,</b> <b>with</b> most of the bark left, to wood that had decayed {{to the point that it}} was mostly soft throughout.|$|E
5|$|Those {{materials}} are extremely <b>hard,</b> <b>with</b> the hardness of bulk c-BN being slightly smaller and w-BN even {{higher than that}} of diamond. Polycrystalline c-BN with grain sizes on the order of 10nm is also reported to have Vickers hardness comparable or higher than diamond. Because of much better stability to heat and transition metals, c-BN surpasses diamond in mechanical applications, such as machining steel. The thermal conductivity of BN is among the highest of all electric insulators (see table).|$|E

5|$|After {{the public}} and press {{interest}} garnered from Echo & the Bunnymen's debut album, Crocodiles, the band released the Shine So Hard EP which maintained their profile. Work then soon began on their second album, Heaven Up Here. Following musical differences between the band and Crocodiles producers Bill Drummond and David Balfe, Hugh Jones {{was brought in to}} produce Heaven Up Here. Jones had previously engineered Crocodiles and co-produced Shine So <b>Hard</b> <b>with</b> Drummond. Jones would later go on to produce the band's 2005 album Siberia. The band were also given an additional producer credit. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth in Wales during March 1981.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the effects}} of Hudah, the cyclone was {{considered}} the worst to strike the Antalaha region in 20years. The towns of Maroantsetra and Andapa were also hit <b>hard,</b> <b>with</b> 60–70percent of homes in the latter destroyed. Maroantsetra, a coastal town, was flooded by the storm surge, and as a result seven people died. The commune of Mananara Nord was completely flooded by the storm. Other isolated villages could not be reached via road or telecommunications due to the storm. One of these cities was Sambava, which suffered from a lack of available telephone links since late on April2. One person died in Sambava. A resort in the town of Cap Est was flattened. Initial estimates indicated that Hudah caused at least 100,000people to become homeless.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) teaches Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{about his}} {{favorite}} movie, Die Hard, {{and attempts to}} recite all the dialogue from memory while an impressed Erin checks his accuracy using an online transcript. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and {{says that he is}} going to stay for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die <b>Hard</b> <b>with</b> Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing his arm around her. In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then whips off his glasses and kisses her back.|$|E
5|$|Strong winds {{from the}} {{hurricane}} downed trees and power lines throughout southern Oaxaca. The storm temporarily isolated Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca and a navy base thereby cutting off communications {{from the rest}} of Mexico. In Huatulco, the winds blew down antennas at the local television station and destroyed at least 30cardboard houses. A community near the airport of the city was hit <b>hard,</b> <b>with</b> several people left homeless. Heavy rainfall from the storm caused severe flooding in portions of Oaxaca and neighboring Chiapas. A total of about 500entire communities were destroyed in Oaxaca; the areas worst affected were Zapotecos, Chatino, and Mixtecos.|$|E
5|$|We {{received}} daily e-mails with feedback {{that was}} concise, unambiguous and occasionally entertaining. She works extremely <b>hard</b> <b>with</b> gumption and detail, {{and it was}} clear to us how she has remained on top for twenty years. It was no use being unprepared with vague ideas disguised as creativity, and there was no place to hide... First it felt like doing nonsense, then it's fun and it's something that's going to be seen. The project brings us into contact with interesting actors within both film and music.|$|E

5|$|While {{spending}} time with Finn and Jake, Princess Bubblegum realizes {{that she needs to}} leave for a science convention in the Veggie Village. She entrusts the two with guarding her Princess Plant. However, when she departs, Finn and Jake party too <b>hard</b> <b>with</b> the plant, killing it. They then decide on a way to journey into the Land of the Dead and to reclaim the flower's soul from Death himself. For an unspecified price, Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) teaches the two how to get into the Underworld, and he instructs Finn and Jake also to tell Death that he said hello.|$|E
5|$|Willis has {{appeared}} in four films with Samuel L. Jackson (National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1, Pulp Fiction, Die <b>Hard</b> <b>with</b> a Vengeance, and Unbreakable) and both actors were slated {{to work together in}} Black Water Transit, before dropping out. Willis also worked with his eldest daughter, Rumer, in the 2005 film Hostage. In 2007, he appeared in the thriller Perfect Stranger, opposite Halle Berry, the crime/drama film Alpha Dog, opposite Sharon Stone, and reprised his role as John McClane in Live Free or Die Hard. Subsequently, he appeared in the films What Just Happened and Surrogates, based on the comic book of the same name.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and <b>hard</b> <b>with</b> cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E
