25|$|The main {{methods used}} for <b>humanitarian</b> <b>demining</b> on land are: manual {{detection}} using metal detectors and prodders, detection by specially trained mine detection dogs, and mechanical clearance using armored vehicles fitted with flails, tiller or similar devices. There is an organization, APOPO, that is training African rats to detect landmines much as dogs do, offering a local solution to countries in Africa. In many circumstances, the only method {{that meets the}} United Nations' requirements for effective <b>humanitarian</b> <b>demining,</b> the International Mine Action Standards (IMAS), is manual detection and disarmament. The process is typically slow, expensive and dangerous, although demining can be safer than construction work if procedures are followed rigorously. New technologies may provide effective alternatives.|$|E
25|$|In some situations, {{clearing}} landmines is {{a necessary}} condition before other humanitarian programs can be implemented.

25|$|In the past, the Colombian {{government}} laid landmines around 34 {{military bases}} to protect key infrastructure, but it renounced {{their use in}} 1997. Landmines are primarily used by the rebel groups to protect their home bases and illegal drug crops, which fund the conflict. FARC and ELN have deployed antipersonnel mines throughout an estimated area of up to 100 square kilometers. In March 2015, FARC stated that it would begin <b>humanitarian</b> <b>demining</b> in selected parts of Colombia.|$|E
25|$|Mine rollers {{and mine}} flails. The roller method {{originated}} during World War I and the flail method during World War II but both are still used. Neither system is completely reliable and both will leave undetonated mines, requiring the minefield to be rechecked by another method. Mine flail effectiveness can approach 100% in ideal conditions, but clearance rates {{as low as}} 50–60% have been reported. This is well below the 99.6% standard set by the United Nations for <b>humanitarian</b> <b>demining.</b>|$|E

50|$|Mine {{clearance}} in Sri Lanka {{has been}} shaped by the war with the LTTE. Soon after demining started in 1999, it was halted by the fighting. When it resumed in 2002, {{the creation of the}} National Steering Committee for Mine Action (NSCMA) paved the way for a more concerted demining effort involving international NGOs, such as HALO. The collapse of the (2002) ceasefire agreement in 2006 and escalating fighting severely constrained the pace of <b>humanitarian</b> aid and <b>demining.</b> The LTTE's defeat in May 2009 led to a new government focus on demining as a prerequisite for resettlement of people displaced by the conflict.|$|R

It was established as the primary base in the region {{for the support of}} Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa (OEF-HOA). After negotiations between March and May 2001, the Djiboutian government allowed for the base's use by the U.S., providing for <b>demining,</b> <b>humanitarian,</b> and counter-terrorism efforts, and it now serves as the location from which U.S. and Coalition forces are operating in the Horn of Africa. The access agreement made by officials from the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti with the Djiboutian government allows for use of the camp, as well as a nearby airport and port facilities.According to a former senior U.S. military commander, Camp Lemonnier is the centerpiece of a network of around six U.S. drone and surveillance bases stretching across the continent. The latter air bases are smaller and operate from remote hangars situated within local military bases or civilian airports. Due to its strategic location, Camp Lemonnier also serves as a hub for aerial operations in the Persian Gulf region.|$|R
