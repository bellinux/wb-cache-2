5|$|Two {{years after}} his {{retirement}} in 1998, Smith {{went to work as}} a roving minor league pitching instructor for the San Francisco Giants. A former teammate, Dick Tidrow, and the manager of the Double-A Shreveport Captains, Jack Hiatt, offered the job to Smith, who gladly agreed, since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> in his hometown. Smith still held this job with the Giants as of 2009.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{persecution}} of Christians by past Roman Emperors had seemingly only strengthened Christianity, many of Julian's actions were designed to harass and undermine the ability of Christians to organize resistance to the re-establishment of paganism in the empire. Julian's preference for a non-Christian and non-philosophical view of Iamblichus' theurgy seems to have convinced him that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> to outlaw {{the practice of the}} Christian view of theurgy and demand the suppression of the Christian set of Mysteries.|$|E
25|$|A {{public inquiry}} into the tolls was held in March 2009 by {{independent}} inspector Neil Taylor. In July 2009, the Department for Transport announced that it {{had decided not to}} allow the proposed increase. Transport Minister Sadiq Khan said he did not believe <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> for the tolls to be raised in the current economic climate. In October 2009, the government approved a £6million grant for maintenance costs, which meant {{that there would be no}} toll increase before 2011 at the earliest, by which time tolls would have been frozen for five years.|$|E
25|$|After {{rest for}} the {{division}} {{and training for}} the replacement troops received, 50th Division moved south and relieved French troops in the River Aisne sector. Unfortunately, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> {{in the path of}} the third phase of the German Spring Offensive (the Third Battle of the Aisne),which opened on 27 May. Several battalions were overrun, all the brigade commanders became casualties, and the division effectively ceased to exist by the end of the day. The Divisional Engineers had been sent up with the pioneers and reserves to occupy the Yellow (reserve) line, but were unable to reach it, meeting the advancing enemy before they reached the position. The remnants of the division were withdrawn two nights later.|$|E

25|$|Wilson {{described}} {{the size of}} Haldane’s planned Expeditionary Force (six divisions of three brigades each and a cavalry division of four brigades) as simply a “reshuffle” of the troops available in Britain, and often declared that “there was no military problem to which the answer was six divisions”. Foch {{is supposed to have}} told Wilson that he would be happy for Britain to send just a corporal and four men, provided <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> {{from the start of the}} war, and that he promised to get them killed, so that Britain would come into the war with all her strength. Foch, recently returned from a visit to Russia, was concerned that France might not be able to count on Russian support in the event of war, and was more keen than ever to enlist British military aid. He invited Wilson and Colonel Fairholme, British military attaché in Paris, to his daughter’s wedding in October 1910. On a visit to London (6 December 1910) Wilson took him for a meeting with Sir Arthur Nicolson, Permanent-Under Secretary at the Foreign Office.|$|E
25|$|Given {{his very}} weak heart, Poirot conceives {{that he must}} end the string of murders by killing Norton. Poirot invites Norton for hot chocolate: at their meeting, he tells Norton what he {{suspects}} and his plan to execute him. Norton, arrogant and self-assured, insists on swapping cups: anticipating this move, Poirot had drugged both cups, knowing {{that he had a}} higher tolerance for a dose that would incapacitate Norton. Poirot moves the sleeping Norton back to his room using the wheelchair: Poirot could walk, one reason he needed a new valet who was unaware of that for this last case. Then, being the same height as Norton, he disguises himself as Norton by removing his wig and false moustache, ruffling up his grey hair, then donning Norton's dressing-gown and walking with a limp. Having Hastings establish that Norton was alive after he left Poirot's room, Poirot shoots Norton, leaves the pistol on the table and locks the room with a duplicate key. Poirot then writes his story, and ceases to take his amyl nitrite heart medicine. He cannot say <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> to commit murder, but on balance he was sure he prevented yet more instigated by Norton. His last wish for Hastings is typical for Poirot, the matchmaker: he suggests that Hastings should pursue Elizabeth Cole.|$|E

At the event, Gwar (who are also from Richmond) frontman Dave Brockie said: “I don’t think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> {{for him to be}} arrested. [...] I don’t think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> for him to be locked up.... This stuff could have all been worked out diplomatically or legally before he got there.” In addition to Brockie, other notable figures in heavy metal, such as Tom Araya and David Draiman, have also come out in support of Blythe.|$|E

On his second day, Leno told a nurse that the clock was wrong. When she stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> Leno remarked, [...] "Well if it's right, then what's it doing here?" [...] Leno made several attempts to leave the asylum, twice being successful. He was found each time and promptly returned.|$|E

Eventually they took him to Dr. Foster, a psychiatrist, who put the young Ned through the University of Minnesota Spankalogical Protocol, which involved eight months of continuous spanking. The treatment worked so well that it rendered Flanders unable to express any anger at all and resulted in his trademark nonsensical jabbering at moments when he was particularly close to losing his temper, causing Ned to unknowingly repress his anger.|$|E

On 4 July 2013, Miliband effectively sacked Tom Watson from the Shadow Cabinet after allegations of corruption over the selection of a parliamentary candidate for Falkirk. Watson had offered his resignation, but when Miliband was asked by a journalist specifically whether he had sacked Watson, he replied, [...] "...I said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> for him to go, yes." ...|$|E

5000|$|In addition, celebrities such as Emma Watson {{have also}} taken a pro-feminist stance through social media. In 2014, the UN Women's Ambassador stated," [...] I am from Britain and think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> {{that as a}} woman I am paid the same as my male counterparts. I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> that I {{should be able to}} make {{decisions}} about my own body.

I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> that socially I am afforded the same respect as men. But sadly I can say that there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to receive these rights." [...] Her speech also goes into depth about the negative connotation the word feminist has because of social media and how we as a society can take a stand for gender equality.|$|R

500|$|As {{early as}} November 1972, James Whitmore {{expressed}} a desire to leave Temperatures Rising, claiming that [...] "the show [...] basically a broad farce and I didn't feel <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> for me". Screen Gems head John Mitchell and ABC chief programmer Barry Diller decided to replace Whitmore with comedian Paul Lynde, whose sitcom, The Paul Lynde Show, was airing on Wednesday nights. At the time, Lynde was scoring second only to Peter Falk in TV popularity polls even though his sitcom, which aired opposite The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour on CBS, was floundering in the ratings. Asher was against making this change but was overruled as his contractual commitments to ABC had been used up.|$|E

Reid sent Lavigne back to The Matrix {{to work with}} them, initially for a month. Arista gave the team [...] to write and produce 10 songs, which took them two months. The album was originally entitled Anything But Ordinary, after the track {{of the same name}} that The Matrix produced, but Lavigne asked Reid for the album to be called Let Go instead.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1997, Blink-182 would enter an {{extended}} period of touring to support their second studio album, Dude Ranch. The group had played a handful of dates on the Vans Warped Tour 1996, a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music. However, upon Dude Ranch release and popularity, Blink-182 would play every date of the 1997 tour worldwide with the bands NOFX and Social Distortion. The group were gone from their hometown of San Diego for nearly nine months straight beginning in late 1997. [...] "When we did our longest tour stretch, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> when I started dating my fiancee," [...] recalled vocalist/guitarist Tom DeLonge.

[...] Lennon later said the composition [...] "should be credited as a Lennon/Ono song.
