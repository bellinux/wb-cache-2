40|$|Plasma-deposited {{germanium}} nitride {{was investigated}} {{for the first}} time as a possible gate insulator for InP compound semiconductor metal-insulator-semiconductor FET (MISFET) technology. The germanium nitride films were successfully deposited in a capacitively coupled parallel plate reactor at 13. 56 MHz operation using GeH 4 /N 2 /NH 3 and GeH 4 /N 2 mixtures as reactant gases. The former process produced better quality films with enhanced uniformity, increased deposition rates, and increased resistivity. The breakdown field strength of the films was greater than 10 to the 6 th V/cm. Auger electron spectroscopy did not indicate significant chemical composition differences between the two processes. For MISFETs with 2 -micron channel lengths fabricated on InP, the device transconductance and threshold voltage for the GeH 4 /N 2 /NH 3 process were 17 mS/mm and - 3. 6 V, respectively.

Low output conductance (less than 6 mS/mm for VGS = 0 V) and low gate leakage current (less than 100 nA) are measured out to a drain-source bias of 20 V, indicating that the effects of impact ionization are reduced in the 2 -D MESFET. Excellent off-state <b>drain-source</b> and drain-gate <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> are experimentally measured to be 20 and 21 V, respectively.

40|$|A new {{low-voltage}} planar power MOSFET with a segmented junction {{field effect}} transistor (JFET) region is proposed and demonstrated in this paper. The segmented JFET region consists of alternating n- and p-regions formed by using ion implantation, and it is fully depleted before the <b>drain-source</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> is reached to provide a high breakdown voltage. The new planar power MOSFET allows a smaller gate-drain overlap area, a shallower p-body, and a JFET region with a doping concentration higher than those of the conventional vertical double-diffused MOSFETs (VDMOSFETs). The new structure with a breakdown voltage of 34 V is fabricated by using a 0. 5 -mu m technology and is compared with the conventional VDMOSFET. The gate-drain charge density and the figure-of-merit are improved by 51 % and 48 %, respectively. However, the specific on-resistance of the device is increased by 5 % due to the smaller conducting area in the segmented JFET region. Simulation results show that the figure-of-merit of the new structure is very favorable compared to those of commercial devices at the same voltage rating...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-We {{have carried}} out an {{experimental}} study exploring both impact ionization and electron transport in InAlAs/n+-InP HFET’s. Our devices show no signature of impact ionization in the gate current, which remains below 17 p”m under typical bias conditions for L, = 0. 8 pm devices (60 ties lower than for InAlASnnGaAs HEMT’s). The lack of impact ionization {{results in a}} <b>drain-source</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> (BV’s) that increases as the device is turned on, displaying an off-state value of 10 V. Ad-ditionally, {{we find that the}} channel electron velocity approaches the InP saturation velocity of about lo 7 cm/s (in devices with L, < 1. 6 pm) rather than reaching the material’s peak velocity. We attribute this to the impact of channel doping both on the steady-state peak velocity and on the conditions necessary for velocity overshoot to take place. Our findings suggest that the InP-channel HFET benefits from channel electrons which remain cold even at large VGS and VDS making the device well-suited to power applications demanding small IG, low gd, and high BVDS.

The wobble micromotors studied have a diameter of 4 mm with a height of 200 micrometres and have been designed at Heriot-Watt University and manufactured using the UV-LIGA process.

We have {{investigated}} the field limiting ring (FLR) geometry dependence of <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> characteristics for a junction barrier Schottky (JBS) -assisted FLR SiC-SBD. The SiC-SBDs having a guard ring-assisted FLR surrounding a Schottky contact edge and an internal ring inside Schottky contact were fabricated. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> characteristics of the JBS-assisted FLR SiC-SBD are significantly dependent on the width, spacing, and number of FLR. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> characteristic is improved as either the FLR width and FLR number increase or the FLR spacing decreases.

40|$|The {{effect of}} neutron {{irradiation}} on power metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (power MOSFETs) <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> has been investigated. Power MOSFETs of both n- and p-channel with manufacturer's rated <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> between 100 to 500 V were radiated up to accumulated neutron fluence of 5 x 10 ¹⁴ neutron/cm² Considerable {{increase in the}} <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> were observed in n-type MOSFETs after 10 ¹³ neutron/cm² and to p-type MOSFETs after 10 ¹² neutron/cm² The increase in <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltages</b> {{is due to the}} decrease in the mean free path caused by the neutron-irradiation-induced defects. The effect of positive trapped charge oxide and the termination structure to the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> were considered. S-PISCES 2 B device simulation was used to investigate the change in the b coefficient of Chynoweth's law that relates to the mean free path.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> of a pulsed d. c. {{magnetron sputtering}} system under various operating conditions {{has been studied}} with reference to Paschen’s Law. This can help to understand the conditions necessary for a stable <b>breakdown</b> at low <b>voltage</b> and hence improve sputtering performance and target life. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> decreases with increasing pressure in constant current mode, and at a certain pressure it reaches a minimum value and then increases thereafter. The behaviour of <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> versus pressure does not follow previous models based on Paschen’s curve, but instead follows an exponential linear functional form. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> decreases and the graph minima move towards the lower pressure region when the frequency is increased. It {{is possible that the}} combined effect of metastable atoms or ions that remain from the previous pulse-on time and the high mean free path at lower pressures results in this effect. The pressure at which the minimum value of <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> occurred was calculated by applying an exponential linear function for different electrode separations. From this analysis, {{it is clear that the}} pressure at which the minimum breakdown occurs is independent of the electrode separation. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> minima shift towards higher pressures when the operating current is increased. The behaviour of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> with pulsing frequency at different pressures and constant pulse-off time was recorded and revealed that the <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> decreased consistently as the frequency increased up to 70 kHz.
