5|$|In 2011 An FDA panel voted {{unanimously}} to recommend approval of florbetapir, which is currently used in an investigational study.

5|$|Apart from Greece itself, {{medicinal}} plants are produced in Italy in Tyrrhenia, as Aeschylus records, and Latium; and in Egypt, which as Homer mentions {{is the source}} of the drug nepenthes that makes men forget sorrow and passion. The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from Crete. Wolfsbane comes from Crete and Zakynthos; <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> into a poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people gentle and cheerful. Birthwort has many uses including for bruises on the head, snakebite, and prolapse of the uterus.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit of}} {{blackcurrants}} can be eaten raw, {{but it has}} a strong, tart flavour. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> into jams and jellies which set readily because of the fruit's high content of pectin and acid. For culinary use, the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a purée, which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice. The purée {{can be used to make}} blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes, yogurt, ice cream, desserts, sorbets and many other sweet dishes. The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding, or apples in crumbles and pies. The juice can be used in syrups and cordials. Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of Rødgrød, a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines.|$|E
5|$|The pale-brown bromine monofluoride (BrF) is {{unstable}} at room temperature, disproportionating {{quickly and}} irreversibly into bromine, bromine trifluoride, and bromine pentafluoride. It thus cannot be obtained pure. It may be synthesised by the direct {{reaction of the}} elements, or by the comproportionation of bromine and bromine trifluoride at high temperatures. Bromine monochloride (BrCl), a red-brown gas, quite readily dissociates reversibly into bromine and chlorine at room temperature and thus also cannot be obtained pure, though <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> by the reversible direct reaction of its elements in the gas phase or in carbon tetrachloride. Bromine monofluoride in ethanol readily leads to the monobromination of the aromatic compounds PhX (para-bromination occurs for X = Me, But, OMe, Br; meta-bromination occurs for the deactivating X = –CO2Et, –CHO, –NO2); {{this is due to}} heterolytic fission of the Br–F bond, leading to rapid electrophilic bromination by Br+.|$|E

25|$|In a {{fast neutron}} reactor, the minor {{actinides}} produced by neutron capture of uranium and plutonium {{can be used}} as fuel. Metal actinide fuel is typically an alloy of zirconium, uranium, plutonium, and minor actinides. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> inherently safe as thermal expansion of the metal alloy will increase neutron leakage.|$|E

25|$|Cysteine is {{similarly}} produced, namely <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from an activated serine and either from homocysteine ("reverse trans-sulfurylation route") or from hydrogen sulfide ("direct sulfurylation route"); the activated serine is generally O-acetyl-serine (via CysK or CysM in E. coli), but in Aeropyrum pernix {{and some other}} archaea O-phosphoserine is used. CysK and CysM are homologues, but belong to the PLP fold type III clade.|$|E
25|$|Kappa {{are also}} said to victimize animals, {{especially}} horses and cows. The motif of the kappa trying to drown a horse is found all over Japan. In these stories, if a kappa {{is caught in}} the act, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> to apologize, sometimes in writing.

25|$|The fotă is a richly-ornamented {{wrap-around}} skirt {{made out}} of a rectangular piece of woolen fabric worn at the waist.

The fotă has several names, according to the ethnographic region: pestelcă (in Muntenia), opreg, vălnic and zăvelcă (in Oltenia), catrință or cretință (in Moldavia), păstură and zadie (in Transylvania), peștiman (in Bessarabia).|$|E
25|$|The vault door is also molded {{of special}} {{concrete}} {{used to make}} the panels, but <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> in several ways. The door mold differs from the panel molds because there is a hole for the lock and the door will be clad in stainless steel. Some manufacturers use the steel cladding as the mold and pour the concrete directly into it. Other manufacturers use a regular mold and screw the steel on after the panel is dry.|$|E
25|$|One {{special case}} {{has had a}} {{significant}} impact on representation theory, namely the representation theory of quivers. A quiver is simply a directed graph (with loops and multiple arrows allowed), but <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> into a category (and also an algebra) by considering paths in the graph. Representations of such categories/algebras have illuminated several aspects of representation theory, for instance by allowing non-semisimple representation theory questions about a group to be reduced in some cases to semisimple representation theory questions about a quiver.|$|E
