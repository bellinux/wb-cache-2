5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E
5|$|During the transition, many {{or most of}} the {{employees}} of the IRS (105,978 in 2005) would face loss of employment. The Beacon Hill Institute <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the federal government would be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of federal tax administration by 73%. In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment. The bill would maintain the IRS for three years after implementation before completely decommissioning the agency, providing employees time to find other employment.|$|E
50|$|An <b>estimate</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> in 2003, {{the market}} for home-maintenance and repair {{spending}} was up 14% from 2001 to 2003. Another <b>estimate</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the market in the}} United States was $126 billion and was increasing by about 4% annually. American homes <b>are</b> aging; one <b>estimate</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> in 2007, {{more than half of all}} homes are older than 25 years. And, as populations worldwide tend to become older, on average, and since increasingly elderly people will be less inclined and able to maintain their homes, it <b>is</b> likely <b>that</b> demand for handyman services will grow.|$|R

5|$|There existed a {{hierarchy}} of pay between types of auxiliary, with cavalry higher paid than infantry. One recent <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{in the time of}} Augustus, the annual pay structure was: eques alaris (gregalis) 263 denarii, eques cohortalis 225, and cohors infantryman 188. The same differentials (of about 20% between grades) seem to have existed at the time of Domitian (r. 81-96). However, Goldsworthy points out that the common assumption that rates of pay were universal across provinces and units is unproven. Pay may have varied according to the origin of the unit.|$|E

25|$|One <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the average}} hedge fund {{returned}} 11.4% per year, representing a 6.7% return above overall market performance before fees, based on performance data from 8,400 hedge funds. Another <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> between January 2000 and December 2009 hedge funds outperformed other investments and were substantially less volatile, with stocks falling {{an average of}} 2.62% per year over the decade and hedge funds rising an average of 6.54% per year; this was an unusually volatile period with both the 2001-2002 dot-com bubble and a recession beginning mid 2007. However, more recent data show that hedge fund performance has declined and underperformed the market from about 2009 to 2016.|$|E

5000|$|Shrink {{to survive}} was {{initiated}} by Dan Kildee during his term as Treasurer of Genesee County, Michigan. He proposed it {{as a way}} to handle municipal problems in Flint, which had experienced an exodus of people and business during the automobile industry downturn. Flint had been described as one of the poorest Rust Belt cities. One <b>estimate</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> its population had declined by half since 1950. In 2002, authorities established a [...] "municipal land bank" [...] to buy abandoned or foreclosed homes to prevent them from being bought up by real estate speculators. One report <b>was</b> <b>that</b> by the summer of 2009, 1,100 homes in Flint had <b>been</b> bulldozed and <b>that</b> another 3,000 had been scheduled for demolition. One <b>estimate</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the city's size would shrink by twenty per cent, while a second <b>estimate</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it needed to contract by 40% to once again become viable financially.|$|R
25|$|One <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the second}} Iraq War {{along with the}} {{so-called}} War on Terror cost $551 billion, or $597 billion in 2009 dollars. Boston University professor Andrew Bacevich has criticized American profligacy and squandering its wealth.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{approximately}} 36 million Hakka {{people are}} {{scattered throughout the}} world. More than 31 million lives in over 200 cities and counties spread throughout seven provinces of China: Guangdong, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Fujian, Hong Kong, Hunan.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{of autism}} {{frequency}} {{have been particularly}} rare in the Middle East. One rough <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the prevalence of autism in Saudi Arabia is 18 per 10,000, slightly higher than the 13 per 10,000 reported in developed countries. Estimates for ASD prevalence in Saudi Arabia are not available.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the large}} number of injuries, rounds fired, weapons used, and overall length of the shootout, it is {{regarded}} as one of the longest and bloodiest events in American police history. Both men had fired approximately 1,100 rounds, while approximately 650 rounds were fired by police. Another <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a total of nearly 2,000 rounds were fired.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimated}} 12 million Africans {{arrived in}} the Americas from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Of these, an estimated 645,000 were brought {{to what is now}} the United States. The usual <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> about 15% of slaves died during the voyage, with mortality rates considerably higher in Africa itself in the process of capturing and transporting indigenous peoples to the ships.|$|E
25|$|Census {{figures in}} Ireland {{do not provide}} a {{breakdown}} of religions outside of the major Christian denominations and other major world religions. A total of 22,497 people stated Other Religion in the 2006 census; and a rough <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there were 2,000–3,000 practicing pagans in Ireland in 2009. Numerous pagan groups – primarily Wiccan and Druidic – exist in Ireland though none is officially recognised by the Government. Irish Paganism is often strongly concerned with issues of place and language.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} {{physically}} possible elements is unknown. A low <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the periodic table}} may end soon after the island of stability, {{which is expected to}} center on Z = 126, as the extension of the periodic and nuclides tables is restricted by the proton and the neutron drip lines; some, such as Walter Greiner, predicted that there may not be an end to the periodic table. Other predictions of an end to the periodic table include Z = 128 (John Emsley) and Z = 155 (Albert Khazan).|$|E
25|$|The loss of 30% of the country's {{generating}} capacity led to much greater reliance on {{liquified natural gas}} and coal. Unusual conservation measures were undertaken. In the immediate aftermath, nine prefectures served by TEPCO experienced power rationing. The government asked major companies to reduce power consumption by 15%, and some shifted their weekends to weekdays to smooth power demand. Converting to a nuclear-free gas and oil energy economy would cost {{tens of billions of}} dollars in annual fees. One <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> even including the disaster, more lives would have been lost if Japan had used coal or gas plants instead of nuclear.|$|E
25|$|Scholarly <b>estimate</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> over 200,000 Scotch-Irish {{migrated}} to the Americas between 1717 and 1775. As a late arriving group, they found that land in the coastal areas of the British colonies was either already owned or too expensive, so they quickly left for the more mountainous interior where land could be obtained cheaply. Here they lived on the first frontier of America. Early frontier life was extremely challenging, but poverty and hardship were familiar to them. The term hillbilly has often been applied to their descendants in the mountains, carrying connotations of poverty, backwardness and violence; this word has its origins in Scotland and Ireland.|$|E
