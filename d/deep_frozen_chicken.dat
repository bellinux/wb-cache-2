40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate residues of three fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin) in chicken meat sold in Ibadan, Nigeria. Two hundred and ninety-seven (297) samples of imported frozen (99) locally produced frozen (99) and freshly slaughtered (99) broiler chicken meat products were screened for antibiotic residues by microbiological assay using Escherichia coli as test organism. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) detection was used for the determination of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin in the positive samples. One hundred and sixty (160) samples, constituting more than half (53. 87 %) of total sample size tested positive for Escherichia coli–sensitive antibiotic residues.   Positive samples were 54. 55 %, 56. 57 % and 52. 53 %, of freshly slaughtered, locally produced <b>frozen</b> <b>chicken</b> and imported <b>frozen</b> <b>chicken</b> meat respectively. Residues of investigated fluoroquinolones occurred more frequently in locally produced <b>frozen</b> <b>chicken</b> than in imported <b>frozen</b> <b>chicken.</b> The concentrations were however consistently higher in imported chicken. Among the three fluoroquinolones examined, the most abundant in imported <b>frozen</b> <b>chicken</b> was ciprofloxacin with mean 354. 83 ± 716. 43 µg/kg. Norfloxacin was the most abundant in freshly slaughtered and locally produced <b>frozen</b> <b>chicken</b> meat, having mean values of 107. 70 ± 138. 36 µg/kg and 120. 96 ± 162. 83 µg/kgrespectively while ofloxacin was the lowest in all categories. Most <b>frozen</b> <b>chicken</b> products imported into Nigeria {{at the time of this}} study contain higher levels of residual fluoroquinolones than the locally produced chicken. In order to tackle fluoroquinolone resistance from a food safety perspective, proper usage and monitoring of fluoroquinolones in meat animals should be encouraged in developing countries...|$|R

40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the levels of}} tetracycline and heavy metals (lead and cadmium) levels in <b>frozen</b> <b>chicken.</b> One hundred <b>frozen</b> <b>chicken</b> muscle samples were sourced from major markets in Lagos and Ibadan (fifty samples each). The samples were analyzed using High Power Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for tetracycline residue determination while Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) {{was used to determine}} the levels of lead and cadmium residues in the samples. Mean concentrations of tetracycline residue levels in the <b>frozen</b> <b>chicken</b> sampled ranged from 1. 1589 - 1. 0463 ppm which is higher than the maximum residue limit set by international food safety agencies. Pb contents were higher in chicken muscles sampled from markets in Ibadan (0. 0227 ± 0. 0069 μg dL - 1) than Lagos (0. 0207 ± 0. 0082 μg dL - 1), while Cd levels were 0. 0013 μg dL - 1 higher than in the Lagos samples (0. 0065 ± 0. 0026 μg dL - 1). These values were within maximum residue limits. There were no significant differences (p< 0. 05) in levels of tetracycline, lead and cadmium levels from the two market locations (Lagos and Ibadan) and parts (wings and thigh muscles). However, significant differences occurred in tetracycline and Pb levels in <b>frozen</b> <b>chicken</b> sourced from Cotonou. Though not significant, tetracycline contents in the thigh muscles of the <b>frozen</b> <b>chicken</b> samples was higher than that of the wings muscles and this was attributed to the site of administration of antibiotic injection and failure to observe the pre-slaughter withdrawal period by the farmers.

Regarding the examined 28 stool cultures from hospitalized children with underlying disease in Assiut Univ. hospital, 2 (7. 14 %) were found positive for Listeria spp. For identification of L. monocytogenes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), two primers were selected to detect 217 -pb fragment ofthe prfA (transcriptional activator of the virulence factor) gene for L. monocytogenes. 13 selected Listeria isolates displayed beta-haemolysis on sheep blood agar and positive CAMP test were further identified using PCR.
