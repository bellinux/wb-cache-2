5|$|Quatermass and Briscoe {{determine}} {{from the}} evidence at hand that something living in outer space has entered the ship, dissolved Reichenheim and Green in their sealed spacesuits, and evidently entered Carroon's body, which {{is now in the}} process of being changed by this unknown entity. Not knowing any of this, Carroon's wife, Judith, hires a private investigator, Christie, to break her husband out of the secured hospital. The escape is successful, but not before Carroon smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room, fuses it into his flesh, then kills the private investigator and absorbs all the forces of life in his body, leaving just a shrivelled husk. It does not take long for Judith to discover what is <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband; Carroon flees and disappears into the London night, leaving her screaming outside the hospital, alive, unharmed, but entirely mad from fright.|$|E
25|$|Ori and Sein {{come across}} two beings in their quest: Gumo, the last {{survivor}} of the spider-like Gumon clan and whose home supports the Wind element; and Kuro, a giant owl who is hostile toward Ori. Her hostility and the forest's cataclysm are explained in flashbacks. When Ori was lost, the Spirit Tree released {{a flash of light}} to look for them, which killed all of Kuro's recently hatched offspring. To prevent this from <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> yet unborn child, Kuro took away the core on top of the Spirit Tree, which is actually Sein. Without the Spirit Tree's support, the three elements cannot be sustained, and Nibel lost its balance. As the element of Wind is rekindled, Gumo, realizing what Ori and Sein intend to do, uses his clan treasure that stores the light from the Spirit Tree to revive Naru, and takes her to where Ori is.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of facing}} this tragedy in terror, she {{is coming to}} terms with what is <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her...</b> Many {{patients}} actually start opening up to the possibility of what's happening to them, but there's very little vocabulary to help them deal... We decided to expand it with this woman [...] offering a gift to her husband as a metaphor that tells him where she's come to in her awe inspiring journey towards death. Hopefully through time he'll be able to understand it and basically get where she is.|$|E

500|$|Jimmy Iovine, the {{chairman}} of M.I.A.'s American distribution label Interscope, compares M.I.A. to Reed and punk rock songwriter Patti Smith, and recalled, [...] "She's gonna do what she's gonna do, I can't tell her shit." [...] "The really left-of-center artists, you really wonder about them. Can the world catch up? Can the culture meet them in the middle? That’s what the adventure is. It doesn’t always happen, but it should and it could." [...] Richard Russell, head of XL Recordings, states, [...] "You've got to bend culture around to suit you, and I think M.I.A has done that" [...] adding that M.I.A.'s composition and production skills were a major attraction for him. As a vocalist, M.I.A. is recognisable by her distinctive whooping, chanting voice, which {{has been described as}} having an [...] "indelible, nursery-rhyme swing." [...] She has adopted different singing styles on her songs, from aggressive raps, to semi-spoken and melodic vocals. She has said of the sometimes [...] "unaffected" [...] vocals and delivery of her lyrics, [...] "It is what it is. Most people would just put it down to me being lazy. But at the same time, I don’t want ," [...] saying some of the [...] "raw and difficult" [...] vocal styles she used reflected what was <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> during recording.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable movie scene {{involving}} menarche is that from the 1976 horror movie Carrie. Carrie White experiences her first period as she showers after the school gym class, and unaware of what is <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> she panics and pleads for help, but the other girls respond by bullying her. The movie is an adaptation of the novel with the same name by [...] Stephen King. Carrie's first period unleashes her violent powers and is central to her dangerous [...] and out of control transformation. This theme is common to horror movies, another notable example being the 2000 Canadian horror film Ginger Snaps, where the protagonist's first period is central to her gradual transformation into a werewolf. Girls experiencing their first period is part of many movies, though not central to their plot, including The Blue Lagoon, My Girl, A Walk on the Moon.|$|E
2500|$|Even if {{defendant}} Stump had {{not been}} foreclosed under the Indiana statutory scheme from fashioning a new common law remedy in this case, we would still find his action to be an illegitimate exercise of his common law power because of his failure to comply with elementary principles of procedural due process. [...] Here a juvenile was ordered sterilized without the taking of the slightest {{steps to ensure that}} her rights were protected. [...] Not only was the plaintiff not given representation, she was not even told what was <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [...] She was afforded no opportunity to contest the validity of her mother's allegations or to have a higher court examine whether the substance of those allegations, even if true, warranted her sterilization. [...] Finally, the petition and order were never filed in court. [...] This kind of purported justice does not fall within the categories of cases at law or in equity.|$|E

Glittering castles in Spain were shaping themselves out of the mists and rainbows of her lively fancy; adventures wonderful and enthralling were <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in cloudland--adventures that always turned out triumphantly and never involved her in scrapes like those of actual life.|$|E

60|$|There {{was a brief}} silence. The first exhilaration of {{the reunion}} over, Sally deep down in her heart was aware of a troubled feeling as though the world were out of joint. She forced herself to ignore it, {{but it would not}} be ignored. It grew. Dimly she was {{beginning}} to realize what Ginger meant to her, and she fought to keep herself from realizing it. Strange things were <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to-night, strange emotions stirring her. Ginger seemed somehow different, as if she were really seeing him for the first time.|$|E
6000|$|And {{whenever}} her eyes, {{after watching}} {{him for some}} time, inevitably met his, {{she was aware of}} a heat beating up over her consciousness. She sat motionless and in conflict.

Why did he speak to her? Why were his eyes so certain, so full of light and confident, waiting for no permission nor signal? ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was only}} {{late in the}} long evening that, quite abruptly, he began to repent, vividly and decidedly, having fled these two people. He was getting hungry, and that has a curious effect upon the {{emotional}} colouring of our minds. The man was a sinister brute, Hoopdriver saw {{in a flash of}} inspiration, and the girl--she was in some serious trouble. And he who might have helped her had taken his first impulse as decisive--and bolted. This new view of it depressed him dreadfully. What might not be <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> now? He thought again of her tears. Surely it was merely his duty, seeing the trouble afoot, to keep his eye upon it.|$|E
60|$|As for her, she {{at no time}} showed {{any great}} sign of terror or of fear, only {{for a little while}} was {{singularly}} numb and quiet, as though dazed with what had <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Indeed, methinks that wild beast, her grandfather, had so crushed her spirit by his tyranny and his violence that nothing that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> might seem sharp and keen, as it does to others of an ordinary sort.|$|R
