25|$|In May a team {{reported}} {{a way to}} prevent the immune system from rejecting a newly delivered gene. Similar to organ transplantation, gene therapy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>plagued</b> <b>by</b> this problem. The immune system normally recognizes the new gene as foreign and rejects the cells carrying it. The research utilized a newly uncovered network of genes regulated by molecules known as microRNAs. This natural function selectively obscured their therapeutic gene in immune system cells and protected it from discovery. Mice infected with the gene containing an immune-cell microRNA target sequence did not reject the gene.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the Nigerian Power Sector <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>plagued</b> <b>by</b> blackouts. Economists {{estimate}} that power outages have cost Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, {{billions of dollars}} in imported diesel for generators and lost output. In a study conducted by the World Bank, a lack of access to financing and electricity were cited as Nigeria's main obstacles to development, surpassing corruption. President Jonathan has overseen the privatisation of Nigeria's power sector with the end goal being the establishment of an efficient and reliable power supply infrastructure for the Nigerian population. The Power Holding Company of Nigeria, which acted as the nation's electricity provider, has been broken up into 15 firms, with Nigeria handing over control of state electricity assets to 15 private bidding companies. The Nigerian government contracted for the services of CPCS Transcom Limited, a Canada-based consulting firm specialising in transportation and energy infrastructure projects, to act as the transaction adviser for the handover of state electricity assets.|$|E
