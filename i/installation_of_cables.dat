50|$|Watford Power Station was a {{coal-fired}} power station situated in Watford's Riverside area. The station was built by the Watford Corporation Electricity Department starting with the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> in 1899 with completion around 1900, near {{the banks of the}} River Colne.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} the station {{was ready to go}} on air, the central Student Union {{building}} had been built above Square 3, as had the first two towers. As a mark of the importance that the university attached to the station at the time, <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> for induction loops was already planned {{in the construction of the}} residential tower blocks (they were laid along a duct that runs between the towers).|$|E
50|$|During {{the mid-1980s}} the company FlowTex was {{established}} by Mandred Schmider and Klaus Kleiser, two businessmen based in the South-Western state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, {{with the purpose of}} constructing and operating machines for horizontal drilling. The business idea was profitable and successful as it allowed for the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> and pipes without the need to dig up roads, which would have caused considerable traffic chaos and noise pollution. By the year 2000, the two men had sold more than 3,000 machines at around 1.5 million Deutsche Marks.|$|E

50|$|Depending on how {{and where}} {{asbestos}} was applied, it might not pose any risk to most users of the building. If the fibers cannot become dislodged, they cannot be inhaled, and thus the asbestos poses no risk. However, some methods of applying asbestos, particularly flocking, allow asbestos fibers to gradually drop off into the air. Asbestos poses hazards to maintenance personnel who have to drill holes in walls for <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> or pipes. Even if the workers are protected, such maintenance operation may release fibers into the air, which may be inhaled by others. Interventions in areas where asbestos is present often have to follow stringent procedures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{target of}} the paper is to provide {{guidelines}} for indoor antenna selection for passive distributed antenna system or radiating cable implementation. Distributed antenna systems are commonly used for indoor installations, and radiating cables are often used in tunnels, airplanes, or similar constricted areas. However, guidelines for optimizing WCDMA indoor network antenna configuration are lacking in the literature. In this paper, the effect of different distributed antenna configurations on signal quality and system performance is studied, taking also radiating cable in comparison. A special {{attention is paid to}} the future requirements of HSDPA. The measurement results show that planning of distributed antenna system is not very sensitive to the amount of antennas, as long as good coverage can be ensured. Also radiating cable can be used, but providing good coverage requires very dense <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables...</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{validation}} study examines {{the effect on}} vibroacoustic response resulting from the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> bundles on a curved orthogrid panel.

The results of this test are compared with baseline acoustic response tests without cables. Damping estimates from the measured response data are made using a new software tool that leverages a finite element model of the panel in conjunction with advanced optimization techniques. While the full test series is not yet complete, the first configuration <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> bundles that was assessed effectively increased the viscous critical damping fraction of the system by as much as 0. 02 in certain frequency ranges...|$|R

40|$|A cable {{database}} {{was created}} to facilitate and document <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> and wiring in the RHIC project, {{as well as to}} provide a data source to track possible wiring and signal problems. The eight tables of this relational database, currently implemented in Sybase, contain information ranging from cable routing to attenuation of individual wires. This database was created in a hierarchical scheme under the assumption that cables contain wires [...] - each instance of a cable has one to many wires associated with it. This scheme allows entry of information pertinent to individual wires while only requiring single entries for each cable. Relationships to other RHIC databases are also discussed. I.

40|$|Ploughing of {{the seabed}} {{is needed for}} the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> and {{pipelines}} and {{is an area of}} construction likely to increase given plans in the UK and elsewhere for offshore marine energy (wind and tidal). Seabed ploughing is an expensive and sometimes risky operation for which there are limited guidelines as to what the tow force and speed is for an expected trenching profile within a specified ground condition. Most ploughing schemes are designed using semi-empirical approaches, with very few computational tools able {{to take into account the}} geometric and material nonlinearity inherited by the ploughing problem. In this paper we describe how the Material Point Method (MPM) is being used as a numerical tool to model seabed ploughing with the aim of providing an improved predictive tool for the future, via an EPSRC-funded research project at Durham and Dundee Universities. Various issues are discussed in the paper including the means of modelling moving essential boundaries and the choice of basis functions, and this new method in MPM is demonstrated on a simple ploughing problem...|$|E
40|$|Within {{offshore}} installations, making pipe couplings {{to conduct}} electricity is a developing interest. Being {{able to use}} tubing structures to carry the drive electric power, that is necessary downhole, helps to avoid <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> and lines. The challenge {{is to be able}} to make the connection good enough so that the necessary power is transferred to the connected piping dowhole with minimum possible loss. At the same time, the connection has to secure the transfer of the voltage at the output side of the piping without any danger of overheating the connection. An overheating can eventually result in a welded connection between the mating piping. As the capability of the connection to transfer power through the piping is based on the size of the contact area, the material type, the surface topography and most importantly, the connection strength, contact resistance is a limiting design factor in electrical contact design. This paper presents the result of a study performed on the electrical contact resistance of pipe couplings intended for offshore installations. The objective of the study is to investigate the influence of contact pressure (level of press fit) and contact area on the contact resistance...|$|E

40|$|AbstractConsider a given {{undirected graph}} G=(V,E) with non-negative edge lengths, a root node r∈V, {{and a set}} D⊆V of demands with dv {{representing}} the units of flow that demand v∈D wishes to send to the root. We are also given K types of cables, each with a specified capacity and cost per unit length. The single-sink buy-at-bulk (SSBB) problem asks for a low-cost <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> {{along the edges of}} G, such that the demands can simultaneously send their flow to root r. The problem is studied with and without the restriction that the flow from a node must follow a single path to the root. We are allowed to install zero or more copies of a cable type on each edge. The SSBB problem is NP-hard. In this paper, we present a 153. 6 -approximation algorithm for the SSBB problem improving the previous best ratio of 216. For the case in which the flow is splittable, we improve the previous best ratio of 76. 8 to αK, where αK is less than 67. 94 for all K. In particular, α 2 < 17. 7, α 3 < 23. 2, α 4 < 28. 8, and α 5 < 34. 3...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{resistivity}} survey {{was carried out}} in a site proposed for the construction and installation of a Power sub-station. The project will involve subsurface <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> and other objects that easily conduct electricity. Extant laws including EIA also require knowledge of subsurface distribution of resistivity in construction projects that would involve burial of steel pipes and cables. The imperative of this is emphasized by the location of the project in an area of shallow groundwater conditions. Field resistivity measurements were undertaken using ABEM Terrameter SAS 1000, adopting Schlumberger configuration in vertical electric sounding at 12 locations within the study site. The results were used to generate geo-electric log models. Three geo-electric profile models (pseudo- profiles) were also taken NE-SW of the site. Interpretation of the models shows that the area is characterized by two geo-electric layers to the depth of 30 m. The upper layer of lower resistivity occurs to a depth of 2 - 3 m. This layer consists of lateritic to silty sands. The lower layer has a resistivity of between 900 - > 2000 Ωm and represents fine to coarse sands and gravels. On the Soil Electrical Resistivity Classification (BS 1377), the subsoil falls within non-corrosive class. Objects installed in the soil are not likely to suffer corrosion soon. Similarly, subsurface electrical installations will pose minimal hazards and would require basic precautions to avoid electrical accidents...|$|E
40|$|Underwater cable {{installation}} {{has become}} very important that it is affecting our everyday life activities {{in the area of}} telecommunication. These cables transfer and convey data more quickly and cheaply than satellite. However, minimal attention has been given to the policies governing the installation of these cables. This research work critically examines the policy relating to the underwater cable installation, addressing the deficits and exploring the influence on existing rights, seabed ownership, shipping routes, authorisation and licensing agreements, Access and interconnection, monopoly and market power, Implementation and dispute settlement and marine protected (flora and fauna) areas in three different countries; Nigeria, England and U. S. A. The discussion of underwater cable installation in this dissertation focuses on those activities that are required to install and maintain cables on the seabed, including, but not limited to the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> (e. g. laying and burial), pre-lay surveys, cable operations, post-lay surveys, monitoring, maintenance, repair, and cable removal after the project is fully completed.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the suitability <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> <b>of</b> 6 – 110 kW with XLPE insulation in comparison with <b>cables</b> <b>of</b> the same voltage but possessing paper-oil insulation has been fulfilled {{on the basis of}} the method of multi-objective optimization that makes it possible to account not only the quantitative characteristics (of reduced costs), but also qualitative ones. As an indicator of the reliability <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> line the maximum mean time to failure (the value inversely proportional to the parameter of succession of failures), which is an order more for cable lines with XLPE insulation than for cable lines with paper insulation, is adopted. A comprehensive {{assessment of}} the convenience <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> lines revealed that the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> with XLPE insulation features a 1. 2 – 1. 6 times easier installation as compared to three-wire (voltage 10 kW) and 1. 4 times easier installation as compared to single-core oil-filled <b>cables</b> (voltage <b>of</b> 110 kW). The efficacy <b>of</b> the <b>cables</b> 6 – 110 kW with XLPE insulation is proved on the basis on the method of multi-objective optimization, that took into account as the costs for the construction and operation <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> lines and the reliability of its operation, ease <b>of</b> its <b>installation</b> and other quality indicators. If the goals taken into account are considered as equally important, the polyethylene-insulated cables for a voltage of 10 – 110 kW is more efficient as compared to three-wire (voltage 10 kW) and solid (110 kW) cables with paper insulation. Herewith, the cost <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> with XLPE insulation may exceed the cost <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> with paper insulation up to two times. If the most important aim is to provide the minimum reduced costs for the construction and operation <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> line, the use <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> with XLPE insulation for voltage of 10 kW is most advisable in individual cases. </p...|$|R
