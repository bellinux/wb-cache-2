40|$|In the Australian Review of Public Affairs Rodney Tiffen reviews Ben Hills 2 ̆ 7 new {{biography}} of Graham Perkin, editor of The Age between 1966 - 1975. THE GREAT American journalist and media critic Ben Bagdikian said {{that trying to}} be a good journalist on the average American newspaper was like trying to play Bach’s St Matthew Passion on a ukulele. According to Ben Hills, Graham Perkin, the editor of The Age, made it possible to be a good journalist in Australia. Hills, who became one of Australia’s leading investigative reporters on Perkin’s Age, is clearly an admirer of his subject, and he has done his old boss proud in this valuable and readable biography. Perkin’s death made it easy for his life to become the stuff of legend. Having become editor of The Age in 1966, he raised it to become the most influential and important newspaper in Australia, then died suddenly {{of a heart attack in}} October 1975, aged only 45, at the height of one of the country’s greatest political crises which culminated in Sir John Kerr’s dismissal of the Whitlam Government. The Age, founded in 1854, under its publisher/editor David Syme, was the most important newspaper in 19 th century Australia. But after Syme’s death in 1908, aged 80, it entered a period of managerial stagnation and editorial decline. Its circulation peaked at 152, 000 in World War I, but by 1957, when the third Melbourne morning paper, The Argus, closed, it had dropped to 96, 000. Syme wanted the paper to become a civic institution run through a family trust by his heirs and descendants. Instead they were more interested in their regular <b>dividend</b> <b>cheques</b> than in the paper’s development or its social role. Read the full article >...|$|R
