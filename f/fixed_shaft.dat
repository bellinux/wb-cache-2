It was a 997 cc engine based on Ford Cortina 116E block that was designed for Formula 2, and featured the first totally Cosworth-designed head, Laystall forged crankshaft, steel main bearing caps and pistons with only one compression ring and one oil scraper ring each. Cylinder head to block sealing was by a head gasket incorporating Cooper Rings. The basic configuration was quite similar to Coventry Climax FWE on Lotus Elite including its SOHC reverse-flow design, except for a series of 7 spur gears (1 on crank, 2 intermediary gears on 2 fixed shafts mounted on the front cover back plate, 1 on the 116E camshaft used as a jackshaft, 2 on a common <b>fixed</b> <b>shaft</b> in the head, 1 on the camshaft) driving a 5 bearing camshaft and the Ford 5 main bearing iron block.

40|$|The rubber v-belt {{continuously}} variable transmission (RVB-CVT) in motorcycle is very important because it affects good drive ability in terms of response and smoothness for the rider or passenger. RVB-CVT mechanically consists of primary clutch, secondary clutch and V-belt. The new mechanism of mechanical RVB-CVT components with electric motor is introduced. The objectives of this thesis are to design and to simulate a new actuate the electro-mechanical single acting pulley rubber V-belt {{continuously variable}} transmission. The electro-mechanical single acting pulley rubber V-belt {{continuously variable transmission}} (EMSAP RVB-CVT) system consists of two sets of pulleys, primary pulley and cam mechanism placed on input <b>fixed</b> <b>shaft</b> and secondary pulley placed on the secondary <b>fixed</b> <b>shaft.</b> The primary pulley design changes to reduce the centrifugal force generated by {{the mass of the}} weights and clutch spring, replaced the cam mechanism which is controlled by a DC motor through a gear's mechanism.

40|$|Comparing with <b>fixed</b> <b>shaft</b> gearbox, {{vibration}} {{properties of}} planetary gearbox are much more complicated. In a planetary gearbox, there are multiple vibration sources as several pairs of sun-planet gears and several pairs of ring-planet gears mesh simultaneously. In addition, the signal transmission path changes due to {{the rotation of the}} carrier. To facilitate fault detection of a planetary gearbox and avoid catastrophic consequences caused by gear failures, it is essential to understand the vibration properties of a planetary gearbox. This paper aims to simulate vibration signals and investigate vibration properties of a planetary gear set when there is a cracked tooth in a planet gear. Displacement signals of the sun gear and the planet gear, and resultant acceleration signals of the whole planetary gear set will be simulated and investigated. Previous work mainly focuses on the vibration properties of a single component, like the sun gear, the planet gear or the carrier. This paper simulated the vibration signal of a whole planetary gear set when there is a cracked tooth in a planet gear. In addition, fault symptoms will be revealed, which can be utilized to detect the crack in the planet gear. Finally, the proposed approach is experimentally validated. 1...|$|E

40|$|It was {{suggested}} that a mild contraction located immediately upstream of the pump may {{improve the quality of}} flow which is expected to be quite nonuniform coming from the diffuser and the first and second elbow. To investigate the effect of the contraction ratio, the AROl computer model previously used in the Phase A- 2 studies for the Large Cavitation Channel (LCC) main contraction design was applied to the pump contraction. As shown in Fig. 1, the contraction is assumed to be 5. 563 m long and of circular cross section. Area contraction ratios of 0, 10, 20 and 30 percent were used. There is a <b>fixed</b> <b>shaft</b> of constant diameter along the centerline of the contraction. Two different shaft diameters, 0. 508 m and · 1. 016 m, were used based on information available at the time the study was conducted~ Initially, a fifth order polynomial was used for the contraction profile. The profile was later changed to a straight line because the contraction is so mild that the flow is not significantly affected by the boundary shape. Due to symmetry about the vertical plane, only half of the flow region was modeled. Different types of nonuniform inflow velocity profiles were studied. A total of 46 modeling runs covering various geometrical and flow conditions as well as different modeling parameters were made. SSf&K/DMJM:Joint Ventur...|$|E
40|$|Measurement {{techniques}} {{are applied to}} tribocomponents at three size scales. Device-level parameters are assessed in a displacement-controlled axial bearing test rig. Component-level testing is performed using a miniature radio telemeter embedded in a bearing roller. Contact pressure and temperature are measured with thin-film contact sensors fabricated on steel and glass disks and loaded in an optical EHL (elastohydrodynamic lubrication) test system. ^ Low crosstalk bearing torque measurements were made with a compliant <b>fixed</b> <b>shaft</b> and two RF (radio frequency) proximity sensors. Use of single components for multiple functions permitted the fabrication of a 5 by 9 by 1. 5 millimeter sensor/telemeter weighing 80 milligrams. Data was transmitted using thermal frequency modulation of oscillator tank capacitance. Telemeter output sensitivity of the thermal frequency modulation technique at temperatures above 40 °C was 15 KHz/MHz-°C. A comparative analysis of signal conditioner bandwidth, spatial averaging and capacitive coupling facilitates determination of the speed-limiting aspect of a thin-film contact sensor. Techniques for photolithographic patterning of zirconium, a material exhibiting a low pressure coefficient of resistance, have been developed. ^ Load increments up to 10 % associated with component heating and with oil film development in tapered roller bearing contacts were measured using the axial bearing tester. Rapid thermal response to loss of lubricant of instrumented bearing rollers indicates great potential of the technology in condition monitoring. Pressure distributions measured in grease-lubricated contacts loaded to peak Hertz stress levels of 0. 78 to 0. 87 GPa were indicative of the base oils, with no thickener-induced broadening observed. ...|$|E
40|$|The current ship speed {{prediction}} {{at a given}} {{fuel consumption}} shows large differences with the actual operational values for the Happy Star. This can result in schedule fines, unexpected fuel expenditures and difficulties in bunker schedules. The first goal {{of this research is}} to improve these predictions for the expected range of weather conditions and expand it for cargo or no-cargo condition in good or bad weather. A second goal of this research is to gain insight in the uncertainty of predicting fuel consumption. A prediction model is built which takes into account the calm water, added resistance due to wind- and swell waves and added resistance due to wind. The total resistance follows from the sum of these separate components. The total resistance is translated to a value for daily fuel consumption. Using hind-casting a validation is performed with daily fuel consumption from noon reports. The uncertainties accompanied with these calculations are reported as well as the uncertainty propagation in the translation of resistance to consumed fuel. From the results of the simulations it seems justified to conclude that; 1. The separation of cargo/no-cargo conditions and good/bad weather gives an improved estimation the relation between vessel speed and daily fuel consumption, as expressed by the prediction error; a. For no-cargo condition from 79 % to 60 %/ 55 % in good/bad weather respectively b. For cargo condition from 79 % to 56 %/ 60 % in good/bad weather respectively 2. The goodness of the fit for no-cargo conditions is 63 % while this is 32 % for cargo conditions. This difference results from overhanging and high deck cargoes. 3. Wind resistance is the dominant resistance component after calm water resistance in all sailing conditions. In cargo condition during bad weather this contribution gets up to 32 % of the total resistance comparing to 9 % for wave resistance. 4. Following from the previous statement, the most important calculation parameters including highest uncertainty are the true wind angle, the wind load coefficient and true wind speed. Recommendations 1. In case of a long voyage with a large deck-cargo, BigLift should consider to perform a more extensive research on the wind resistance. 2. Monitoring of the following parameters would decrease the uncertainty in the calculations for fuel consumption; a. PTO enabled and how many power produced b.
