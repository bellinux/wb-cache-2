However, relatively few cases exist to provide justification for the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>norm,</b> and under this approach ambiguities and differences of view about the legality of an intervention may deter states from acting.

40|$|This article puts {{forward a}} {{theoretical}} {{explanation for why}} norms of international behavior change over time. It argues that the mainstream neorealist and neoliberal arguments on the static nature of state interests are implausible, as the recent empirical work of the growing constructivist school has convincingly shown. But the constructivists have not yet provided a theoretical basis for understanding why one norm rather than another becomes institutionalized, nor has learning theory yet provided an adequate explanation. An evolutionary approach that draws its hypotheses from an analogy to population genetics offers a promising alternative. This article briefly outlines the constructivist critique of neorealism and neoliberalism.

40|$|Rasmussen, ClaireLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) {{rights have}} emerged as a {{consequential}} issue in contemporary global politics. This is a worldwide phenomenon; same-sex marriage, for example, has been legalized in locales within North and South America, Europe, and Africa, while laws regulating same-sex intimacy have eroded within locales on every continent. This dissertation argues that this marks the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>norm,</b> embodied in a discourse asserting that states should legally enshrine LGBT rights. My intervention is to argue that norms, such as a norm regarding LGBT rights, do not contain any "fixed" content. Analysis of norms must focus on how they come to articulate historically contingent political alliances. This contingency foregrounds the importance of intersectionality, a feminist tool which focuses on how intersecting identity categories intensify the effects of power, to any comprehensive understanding of norms in IR. I apply this framework to understanding an emergent LGBT rights norm in three contexts, all of which foreground particular political alliances formed in relation to an emergent discourse regarding LGBT rights. Chapter two explores the emergence of LGBT rights as an issue within the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, used to assert the moral superiority of Israeli society, while framing Palestinians as unable to rule themselves. The next chapter examines {{the emergence of an}} anti-homosexuality bill in Uganda. I consider how the rhetoric of the US Christian Right interfaced with existing cleavages within Ugandan society, creating a violent reaction against the perceived "threat" of LGBT rights. Chapter four explores legalization of same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom. I argue that the UK's adoption of same-sex marriage must be contextualized alongside simultaneous enactment of exclusionary austerity and immigration policies. I conclude that LGBT rights as a discourse can be employed to diverse ends in ways that reinforce power relationships of contemporary neoliberalism, particularly insofar as it appears to isolate LGBT rights from other forms of political struggle with which it intersects. However, the flexibility and contingency of rights claims also allow activists to creatively rearticulate the idea of LGBT rights in ways that can challenge neoliberalism's exclusionary and normalizing patterns of political alliance and identity.

40|$|Abstract: With the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> “new {{economic}} <b>norm</b> ” and {{the development}} of “economic integration in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei”, electricity demand situation in Beijing will change significantly in the future. To guide the planning and construction of power grid in Beijing, it is indispensable to predict electricity demand during the 13 th Five-year. Since the factors and affecting mechanisms for electricity demand are different in different sectors, the total electricity consumption in this paper is divided into five parts: the first industry, industry, construction industry, the tertiary industry and resident sectors. The exponential smoothing method and co-integration theory are introduced to establish the forecasting model of electricity demand in different sectors. Therefore, based on the forecasting model and scenario analysis, the analysis results show that the total electricity consumption will grow at <b>an</b> annual rate <b>of</b> 4. 9 %- 6. 0 % during 13 th Five-Year-Plan period, and the consumption would reach more than 0. 1397 × 1012 kWh in 2020...|$|R
40|$|In {{the typical}} {{scenario}} of traditional peacekeeping, the UN has acted as an interposition force {{between the parties}} to the conflict. Today however, the UN is no longer the sole component in a mission structure inasmuch as today s peace operations are increasingly multidimensional in both design and purpose. As a result, a common realization has come to be that the success <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mission depends on the actors involved pulling their resources together towards a commonly agreed end product. The concept of integrated missions is the UN response to these calls for simultaneously political, military, humanitarian and developmental efforts. However, although most stakeholders agree why mission integration is important, significant challenges remain when it comes to implementation. Against this backdrop, the Norwegian government has initiated a project to take stock of the current debate. This thesis investigates how the integrated mission concept has moved from an idea towards <b>an</b> institutionalized <b>norm</b> for UN peace operations. Hence the study fulfils a twofold objective. Regarding the empirical achievement, the thesis displays the role a state can play in relation to the ongoing process of UN reform. Concerning the theoretical aim, the study investigates the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> international <b>norm.</b> By reviewing theoretical contributions, I extract what existing IR-theory can tell us about how norms evolve.

40|$|This article {{examines}} how, {{in the course}} of the twentieth century, legal scholars and political theorists helped remove the interests of workers (as differentiated from shareholders, officers, and directors) from the core concerns of corporate law and theory.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the practice of}} humanitarian intervention {{after the end of}} the Cold War. In the 90 s there was <b>an</b> evident willingness <b>of</b> the world community to promote and protect human rights. The Security Council got involved in matters traditionally regarded internal affairs of states and imposed economic and diplomatic sanctions. What is more, the UN authorised military interventions in cases where massive abuses of human rights have taken place and this is the most significant normative change regarding humanitarian intervention. Thus, from "unilateral" humanitarian intervention we move to "collective" humanitarian intervention. Accordingly, the UN Security Council authorised military action in Somalia, Rwanda and Haiti. Yet, although the Council granted authorisation of the use of force, states had been reluctant to recognise <b>a</b> "unilateral" right <b>of</b> humanitarian intervention. Kosovo is the most challenging case that caused a wide debate regarding the legality of humanitarian intervention. Yet, Kosovo has set a very bad precedent for humanitarian intervention. NATO's violations of humanitarian laws, the bombing against civilian infrastructures, as well as the significant loss of civilian lives proved that the means used were against the proclaimed humanitarian ends. Furthermore, NATO intervention did not bring peace to Kosovo, but the situation remains tense. Thus, it could be argued that the 1999 intervention did not bring a positive and long-term outcome. This is a good case that can illustrate how political and moral omissions can create bad precedents for the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>norm.</b> Finally, this thesis concludes that after the attacks of 9 / 11, the prospects of humanitarian intervention in the future are questionable. War against terrorism became the new form of interventionism in the new millennium. Thus, omissions and failures of the past, along with the new challenges of the world community have curtailed the future of humanitarian intervention.

40|$|The UN Security Council is {{the preeminent}} {{multilateral}} decision-making body {{and has the}} legal authority to initiate military interventions if it first determines a threat to international peace and security, including from civil wars or widespread state repression. While traditional norms of non-intervention {{and the politics of}} the Cold War curtailed the body’s ability to fulfil this role, evolving understandings and practices of sovereignty and security in the post-Cold War era have led to the apparent <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>norm</b> permitting ‘humanitarian intervention’ and an in principle acceptance that the body has a ‘responsibility to protect’ vulnerable civilians residing inside the borders of their own state, including through military means. In this context, the thesis argues that the situation in Darfur, western Sudan, has represented a quintessential case for the Council to fulfil its ‘responsibility to protect’. According to <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> authoritative investigations, since 2003 the Sudanese government and government-allied Arab militias have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity on a widespread and systematic basis against Darfur’s non-Arab population. As a result, over 200, 000 people died either directly from violence or indirectly from conflict-induced disease and malnutrition, while a further two million fled from their homes and villages in fear. <b>A</b> number <b>of</b> nonmilitary measures were attempted by the Council but failed to create adequate security on the ground. As such, there was a compelling legal-institutional, normative and moral case for the Council to coercively deploy a military intervention in Sudan to protect vulnerable civilians in Darfur. However, during the 2003 - 06 period of study, no such intervention was deployed. The thesis argues that intervention by the Council was precluded by the national interests of its permanent members, including a lucrative economic relationship between China and Sudan, and because of valuable Sudanese intelligence cooperation in Western counter-terrorism operations in the region. The thesis concludes that the Council’s members chose to preserve these national interests at the expense of protecting civilians in Darfur...|$|R

A dramatic shift in international practice {{emerged in the}} 1990 s when the United Nations Security Council authorized military humanitarian intervention to stop gross human rights violations. During the Cold War, the Security Council did not halt mass killing and sanctioned states that intervened in sovereign states, despite humanitarian motives or effects. It has responded unevenly to mass killing, however. This dissertation seeks to answer the puzzle of why the Security Council intervenes militarily in defense {{of human rights in}} some places but fails to stop ethnic cleansing in others. It traces the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>norm</b> <b>of</b> humanitarian intervention, the course of its evolution (1991 - 2004) and the conditions of its use. The dissertation relies on qualitative, comparative case studies: the establishment of no-fly zones in Iraq; three cases of Security Council authorized humanitarian intervention (Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Sierra Leone); and three "non-cases" where humanitarian intervention might have been expected but was not authorized (Rwanda, Kosovo and Darfur, Sudan). There is a connection between the ways that Council Members argue about conflicts and their intervention decisions. For humanitarian intervention to become possible, members of the Security Council, including most of its permanent members, must adopt or accede to a common story about the character of the conflict and its resultant human rights violations [...] an intentional causal story with clear victims and identifiable and intentional perpetrators. When significant contestation over competing causal stories occurs, the success of any particular causal story is mediated by: the extent to which humanitarian intervention in that particular case would conflict with or complement the highly internalized norms of state sovereignty and non-intervention; the support of Great Power leadership; and the coherence between causal stories and expert testimony, forensic evidence, and media imagery on the cause and character of the conflict. I conclude that humanitarian intervention does not threaten sovereignty but reformulates it to include citizen protection and the recognition of fundamental human rights. The nascent norm of humanitarian intervention, encapsulated in the responsibility to protect, is gaining international support but has not yet cascaded throughout the international system...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores South Korean {{healthcare}} politics {{based on}} <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> inter-generational conflicts {{that occurred in}} a medical community in 2012. The conflicts broke out among 'doctors <b>of</b> Korean medicine', <b>a</b> medical profession unique to Korea practicing <b>a</b> form <b>of</b> medicine of East Asian origin that has recently undergone significant 'bio-medicalization'. Doctors of Korean medicine have the same status as doctors of Western medicine in the country's mainstream healthcare system, although the purview of their practice is legally demarcated. Government policies aimed at the industrialization of pharmaceuticals {{and the promotion of}} health among Korea's elderly population were the source of the conflicts that escalated into <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> junior doctors leading to what could be considered a 'rebellion' against the community leaders. The thesis investigates first the socioeconomic and political backgrounds of the conflict. It proposes that elements of intra- and inter-professional politics and the aftermath of the country's re-democratization, economic shock and demographic transition were all important factors. Second, it explores the nature of the rebellion itself by focusing on the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> <b>norms</b> and values and on the 'ritual-like' interactions observed during the event. The analysis reveals that during the conflicts the actors referenced certain values and ideologies underpinning their everyday lives and, in doing so, were effectively engaged in the strengthening, rather than the weakening, of existing social structures. This thesis contributes to the study of Korean medicine by revealing the features of its integration into the countryâs healthcare system and the effects of its bio-medicalization. By describing the process by which new online-based agents <b>of</b> <b>a</b> social movement emerged, it also contributes to the study of hyper-connectivity in Korean society. Finally, the ethnography contributes to the anthropological study of East Asian medicine by illustrating the importance of institutional factors such as politics and the economy in capturing the modes of its contemporary presence. </p...|$|R
40|$|The chief {{obstacle}} in {{the resolution}} of historical injustices in international law is the inter-temporal question, summarized as the requirement that positive substantive international law, as it stood {{at the time in}} which an injustice occurred, ought always to apply over latter laws. Jus cogens, being largely independent from positive international law, offers a possible resolution to this problem: a possibility that this thesis explores using Mau Mau torture claims as a case study. Present in much legal opinion on the question is a presumption that inter-temporal law applies unless state practice justifying an exception for jus cogens can be found. However, this necessarily subjects jus cogens to inter-temporality and contradicts the standard meaning of jus cogens and its superior status in the entire legal framework of international law. It is argued in this paper that the superiority of jus cogens in international law should be reflected in the application of the inter-temporal principle, as indeed it should in the application of all other inferior norms and principles wherever relevant subject matter is in issue. After the introduction in chapter one, the above-described problem in the scholarly approach to inter-temporal law and jus cogens is highlighted in chapters two and three, wherein an apparent normative conflict between jus cogens and inter-temporal law is demonstrated. But if jus cogens <b>norms</b> begin at <b>an</b> identifiable point in time and are prospective in nature, no over-lap and thus no contradiction can be spoken of where the matter occurred before the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> these <b>norms,</b> <b>a</b> problem tackled in chapter four. Difficulties in the standard definition of jus cogens found in article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties are also discussed along with an argument for an unlimited temporal scope of application for 'humanitarian' peremptory norms. Lastly, chapter five approaches the problem through the prism <b>of</b> <b>a</b> balancing scale <b>of</b> competing interests. In short, this thesis argues that there is no threat to justice, law or truth in applying 'humanitarian' peremptory norms to old injustices in the area of state responsibility...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} in the area of public health communication has predominantly focused on a direct association between information in the media and health behavior change. The dissertation seeks to broaden this theoretical framework by examining complementary routes of media effects on behavior. Specifically, it is argued that by stimulating response from social institutions and facilitating change in the social acceptability of problem behaviors, the media may set in motion formal and informal mechanisms of social control that lead to behavior change. This proposition was tested in relation to the decline in drunk-driving (DD) behavior in between 1978 and 1995. In the first step, an elaborated content analysis procedure revealed that the grassroots movement against DD was instrumental in setting the media agenda for the DD problem but was no more influential than policy-makers. In the next step, the results demonstrated that policy-makers 2 ̆ 7 actions followed the frames and solutions advocated in the media and that the impact of news stories on policy-makers 2 ̆ 7 attention and behavior was primarily manifested in periods of intensive policy-making. The third step of the analysis tested hypotheses regarding the media 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unequivocal social <b>norm</b> against DD. The findings suggested a small independent contribution of media coverage to social disapproval of DD but could not convincingly distinguish between a direct effect (through social learning) and a mediated effect (through social interaction). In the final step, <b>an</b> analysis <b>of</b> all three routes of media effects on DD behavior (i. e., media-behavior, media-policy-behavior, and media-norms-behavior) provided some compelling evidence of mediated media effects on DD behavior and some ambiguous findings regarding direct media effects. In addition, there was evidence that media effects on DD behavior varied by the level of resistance demonstrated by drivers of different age groups to different types of social control efforts. Overall, the results of this study support the argument that by neglecting to consider media effects on health behavior change that are mediated by other social structures, previous studies may have underestimated the contribution of mass communication channels to processes of health behavior change. ...|$|R
40|$|Civil {{conflict}}, {{a violent}} conflict fought between factions internal to a sovereign State, is traditionally {{considered to be}} a domestic matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of States and neither permitted nor prohibited by international law permission. However, increasingly, States, regional organisations and the UN intervene in civil conflicts: they condemn civil conflicts, call on parties to cease fighting and to resolve their disputes by peaceful means, and impose sanctions or intervene forcefully. This thesis reviews this accumulating practice, which has up to now not been systematically analysed, and explores what changes it evidences - or foreshadows - in the relationship between civil conflict and international law. The thesis adopts a two part structure. Part I reviews and categorises the practice of the international community (particularly that of the Council, States and regional organisations) in response to civil conflict. Part II seeks to analyse this practice and investigates whether it evidences the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> new norms of jus ad bellum internum prohibiting certain forms of civil conflict. The thesis begins by setting out <b>a</b> cross section <b>of</b> relevant practice. It first charts the practice of the Security Council in response to 42 civil conflicts since 1945. The thesis then considers three recent cases studies in detail (Sierra Leone, CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Liberia) {{from the perspective of the}} response of the Security Council, States and regional organisations. This review establishes that there is a substantial and growing amount of international community intervention in civil conflicts, contrary to what could be expected given its domestic nature. The thesis then turns to <b>an</b> analysis <b>of</b> this practice, which essentially requires <b>an</b> evaluation <b>of</b> the impact that condemnatory practice by States and regional actors and the Security Council can have on international law. In general terms, <b>an</b> evaluation <b>of</b> whether this practice should be characterised as a policy - or nonbinding - response, or whether its existence and repetition evidences, or anticipates, the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> international law rules, such as the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> new customary law norms of jus ad bellum internum. In order to address this issue, it became clear that <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> methodological questions that have not up to now received much attention in the literature would need to be considered: in particular the role the Security Council plays in shaping new international law. This role is markedly under-theorized - in contrast to that of the General Assembly practice in customary law formation which has been widely debated - but is central to the thesis because of the remarkable scope of Security Council practice in response to civil conflicts. Following the examination of this question, the thesis takes the view that Security Council practice is relevant evidence of the practice of States and of the collective attitude of the international community. It also influences the conduct and attitude of States. In addition, where the Security Council regularly condemns certain conduct in <b>a</b> range <b>of</b> similar situations and seeks to enforce its condemnation, it can create a quasi-legislative prohibition against that conduct. Following the analysis of the practice, the thesis concludes that contrary to widespread assumptions, civil conflict is no longer treated as a domestic matter, and is increasingly being recognised as having a severe impact on the peace and stability <b>of</b> the world. <b>A</b> major and continuing shift in practice is relied on to support predictions of fundamental change in the perception of the legality of recourse to force in civil conflict. The thesis identifies three possible norms within the practice: the rejection of civil conflict aiming to overthrow a democratically elected government; the rejection of civil conflict aiming to cause or causing massive violence against civilians; and the rejection of civil conflict which is undertaken for political aims (other than in self-defence by a State against violent uprising or by a people in self-defence against violent oppression). Much of the practice is too recent and not established enough in the public discourse of States to evidence the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> traditional customary law rules at present. Nonetheless, there is strong evidence to support the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> limited <b>norm</b> prohibiting the overthrow <b>of</b> <b>a</b> democratically elected government. In addition, the extent and scope of the international community condemnation and rejection of civil conflict can be taken to support the proposition that, in time, broader international prohibitions against civil conflict will crystallize in international law. </p...|$|R
