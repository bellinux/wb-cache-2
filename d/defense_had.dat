After a 52–7 win over the Ole Miss Rebels at Vaught–Hemingway Stadium, Alabama returned for their annual Third Saturday in October contest against the Tennessee Volunteers. The Crimson Tide defeated Tennessee for the fifth consecutive season with their 37–6 victory and entered their bye week undefeated and ranked No.2 for their game against No.1 LSU in Tuscaloosa.|$|E

Hananu also formed an alliance with the semi-nomadic Mawali tribesmen of the Aleppo region. Following the battle at Harim, Hananu, with the assistance of Aleppo's Committee of National <b>Defense,</b> <b>had</b> collected up to 2,000 gold pounds in funds, and 1,700 rifles for the 680 men in his iṣābā, who he and his aides trained.|$|E

5|$|The Bears' first away game of {{the season}} {{occurred}} in Seattle, who led the all-time series 10–6, including the last three regular season games. However, the Bears had won the last game in Seattle in 2009 25–19. The Bears offense, not featuring Jay Cutler nor Alshon Jeffery, faced a defense led by Kam Chancellor, who returned to the Seahawks after a holdout. Without Chancellor for the first two games of the season, the <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> allowed quarterbacks to complete 72 percent of their passes with a passer rating of 116.4. Jeff Joniak believed that to counter the Legion of Boom, the Bears had to balance the rushing and passing attacks, while watching for a blitz that pressured Aaron Rodgers 19 times in week two. On defense, the Bears had to watch for quarterback Russell Wilson, though he had struggled with pressure in the first two games, being sacked a total of eight times. Additionally, the run <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> to be aware of a running game led by Marshawn Lynch; the corps had averaged 121.5 yards per game. On special teams, the Bears had to stop speedy rookie receiver Tyler Lockett, who had scored on a punt return earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|Through the 1991 season, it {{was clear}} that the team's core players on <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> aged quickly. This {{deterioration}} continued in 1992, when Lawrence Taylor ruptured his Achilles tendon in the team's tenth game, and the Giants promptly lost six out of their last seven games to finish the year 6–10. The defense continued its descent, finishing 26th in the league in points allowed after leading the league in that category in 1990. Handley, who had become unpopular with both players and fans, was fired after the end of the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{defense was}} led by {{coordinator}} Bud Foster, who was named a candidate in several teams' searches for a new head coach, but decided to remain at Virginia Tech as the buildup to the Orange Bowl continued. Heading into the game, Tech's defense ranked 38th nationally in total yards allowed, its second-worst performance since 1993. Tech's run defense was 58th, permitting an average 148.9rushingyards per game. On {{the positive side of}} things, Tech's <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> the third-most interceptions (22) in the country, and its scoring defense was 16th (19.1 points per game).|$|E

5|$|A blocked {{field goal}} and extra-point attempt {{provided}} {{the margin of}} victory for the Miami Dolphins. Ex-Dolphin receiver Morris Owens came back to haunt his old team with three touchdown catches. Starting quarterback Parnell Dickinson threw the first, then was replaced by recently acquired quarterback Terry Hanratty after injuring his ankle. When Hanratty proved ineffective, Steve Spurrier, who had not practiced during the week due to a swollen knee, came off the bench to throw the final two touchdowns. It took a final-minute, 55-yard Garo Yepremian field goal to clinch the game for the Dolphins, whose pass <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> been decimated by injuries. 192 of the Buccaneers’ 334 total yards came through the air. John McKay would later point to this game as {{the high point of}} the Buccaneers’ season. Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti saw it differently, calling the narrow victory “a disgrace” and “the low point in Miami Dolphins’ history”.|$|E
5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Maryland <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> allowed opponents to score 31points in ten games and {{recorded}} six defensive shut-outs. Only Georgia {{had been able}} to score more than seven points. No ACC team has since held opponents to an equal or lesser amount of points. Maryland's rushing defense (83.9yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (3.1points allowed per game) ranked first in the nation. Maryland had outscored its opponents 298–31. No ACC team scored more total points until 1967. Maryland's star quarterback, Bernie Faloney, had been injured midseason and saw limited game action {{for the remainder of the}} year. Back-up quarterback Charlie Boxold filled in for the majority of the Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2005, Brown, {{together}} with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Marine Corps Commandant General Michael Hagee announced {{the creation of}} the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC). Prior to the creation of MARSOC, the Marine Corps had not been involved in special operations, which were conducted by Army, Navy and Air Force units assigned to U.S. Special Operations Command. After the September 11 attacks, the Secretary of <b>Defense</b> <b>had</b> directed the Marine Corps and Brown's predecessor to work closer together in the Global War on Terror. This culminated in the creation of MCSOCOM Detachment One on June 19, 2003, shortly before Brown took command of USSOCOM. It was nearly three years later on February 24, 2006, when MARSOC was activated at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|On October 14 {{before the}} Week6 trade deadline, Roy Williams {{was traded to}} the Dallas Cowboys for a first, a 3rd and a 7th-round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, making Johnson the Lions' {{starting}} wide receiver and the last big threat on the offense. In his first game without Roy Williams alongside him in the week7 game against the Houston Texans, Johnson caught only two passes, totaling 154yards receiving; the first pass did not come until quarterback Dan Orlovsky threw a pass up for grabs {{at the end of the}} first half which Johnson caught for 58yards and the second pass came on a 96-yard touchdown catch-and-run. With Williams gone and starting quarterback Jon Kitna lost to injury for the season, the Texans <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> little to do to stop the Lions' offense but shut down Johnson, winning the game 28–21.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{noted that}} the Fifth Circuit agreed with Abramski's claim that falsifying the answer to Question 11.a is not {{considered}} material, if the true-buyer can legally buy and possess the gun. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a split between the circuit courts, even though Abramski's <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> changed, and he now claimed {{that the answer to}} Question 11.a is never material. Various parties filed amicus briefs supporting either side. Parties supporting Abramski included the National Rifle Association Civil Rights Defense Fund, and West Virginia and 25 other states, while others, like the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Hawaii and 8 other states (plus the District of Columbia), filed amicus briefs supporting Abramski's conviction.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Huskies had outscored {{their opponents}} 20337 {{during the regular}} season, {{excluding}} the games against New York and Mississippi. Washington's running backs, George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, led their offense during the season, each gaining several hundred rushing yards. However, Tesreau was suffering from boils on his knee, and his coaches urged him to not play in the Rose Bowl. The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy, being much larger on average. Washington's <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> been very effective during the regular season, holding five teams scoreless and allowing more than ten points to be scored against them only once.

5|$|The {{defeat in}} Mile High Stadium {{proved to be}} the last of Cleveland's streak of playoff {{appearances}} in the mid- to late-1980s. Kosar played through numerous injuries in 1989, including bruising on his right arm and a bad knee. Strong <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> carried the Browns to the playoffs even when the offense faltered, but that all crumbled in 1990. Kosar threw more interceptions than touchdowns {{for the first time in}} his career, and the defense allowed more points than any other in the league. The Browns' 2–7 start cost Carson his job. Jim Shofner was named interim head coach, and the team finished 3–13. After the season Bill Belichick, the defensive coordinator of the then-Super Bowl champion New York Giants, was named head coach.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, {{both teams}} found success at times. In the first half, Texas' defense held the Hokies {{to just one}} touchdown, {{and that was not}} {{recorded}} until the second quarter. Virginia Tech's offense was extremely successful in shutting down the Longhorns' offense {{in the second half of}} the game. The Hokies shut out the Longhorns in that half, setting a bowl-game record for fewest points allowed in a half. Texas' 10 points, 78 yards rushing and 226 yards total offense were all season lows. In total, Tech's <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> nine tackles for loss, including five sacks of Brown. Linebacker Brandon Semones was Tech's leading tackler, and he had nine tackles, a sack, and a pass breakup. In pass defense, Torrian Gray had two interceptions, and William Yarborough had one. Gray's interceptions tied a Virginia Tech bowl-game record. Defensive tackle Jim Barron's fumble return for a touchdown was the first such score in the Sugar Bowl since a rule change in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Discussing {{the larger}} culture of {{violence}} that Chicago police had created, journalist Spencer Ackerman in February 2015 reported that Zuley, by then retired from COPD, had served in 2003-2004 with the US Navy Reserve as an interrogator at Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, established by the George W. Bush administration. (Zuley {{had returned to the}} CPD after his Navy service.) In 2003, one of his subjects was the high-profile detainee Mohamedou Ould Slahi, for whom the Secretary of <b>Defense</b> <b>had</b> authorized extended interrogation techniques, since classified as torture. Slahi's memoir, Guantanamo Diary, was published in January 2015, and quickly became an international bestseller. He detailed the torture he suffered. Ackerman noted that inmates with claims or suits against Zuley had recounted details that are similar to the physical and psychological abuse against Slahi. Local Chicago publications identified Zuley as a protege of Burge, but Ackerman said that the two officers never served together. Zuley primarily served on the North Side.|$|E

5|$|The Buccaneers {{opened the}} Ray Perkins era by setting team records for points scored, total yardage, margin of victory, and {{touchdown}} passes thrown. Steve DeBerg was 24 of 34 for 333yards and five touchdowns, throwing touchdowns {{on each of}} the Buccaneers' first four possessions. DeBerg's five touchdown passes still stands as a Buccaneers record, having been tied by Brad Johnson in 2002. Perkins, who had played with Joe Namath in college and Johnny Unitas in the pros, and drafted Phil Simms with the Giants, said that DeBerg had one of the best games of any quarterback with whom he had been associated. In a completely dominating performance, the Buccaneers controlled the ball for 38minutes, allowed no sacks, and converted 14 of 16 third-down attempts. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> four sacks and three turnovers. DeBerg did throw one interception, but on the very next play cornerback Bobby Futrell intercepted David Archer's overthrow of tight end Ken Whisenhunt.|$|E
5|$|The {{second game}} of the Bears-Vikings rivalry took place in Minneapolis and was the third game at TCF Bank Stadium; the Bears won the first game in 2010 while the Vikings won in 2014. To succeed against the Vikings, Jeff Joniak writes that the Bears had to excel {{at the start of}} the game; offensively, the Bears had a first quarter scoring {{differential}} of -48, 31st in the league, while scoring only twice on game-opening possessions. In the third quarter, the Bears scored a league-worst 32 points; in comparison, the Vikings <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> allowed only one touchdown on opening drives and a league-low 37 points in the third quarter. The defense took on a Vikings offense spearheaded by Adrian Peterson, whose 1,251 yards led the league. On special teams, the Vikings led the league in post-kickoff starting position, while being ranked third in returns of at least 20 yards with 26 and first in returns of at least 40 yards with five. Additionally, kickoff returner Cordarrelle Patterson led the league in return average with 31.1 yards. Christian Jones, Cameron Meredith, Bryce Callahan, Nick Becton, Tayo Fabuluje, Jacoby Glenn and Antone Smith were inactive.|$|E
5|$|The 3–8 San Francisco 49ers visited Soldier Field in week thirteen; in 63 all-time meetings, the 49ers {{held the}} lead 32–30–1, though the Bears {{won the last}} game in 2014 28–20. The Bears offense took on a defense {{featuring}} linebackers NaVorro Bowman, Aaron Lynch and Ahmad Brooks, who had a combined 12.5 sacks in 2015, including 6.5 by Lynch. Alshon Jeffery provided a size advantage over cornerbacks Tramaine Brock and Kenneth Acker, the duo having a combined 90 tackles, six interceptions, and 14 pass breakups. As a unit, the 49ers <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> struggled, allowing an average of 400 yards, 8.13 yards per pass (29th overall), 17 touchdown passes and a 100.5 opponent quarterback rating (also 29th-ranked). Despite these troubles, the 49ers had held the Cardinals, who had the league's best scoring offense, to just 19 points in week twelve. As for the Bears defense, the 29th-ranked rushing defense took on a running attack without Carlos Hyde. 49ers quarterback Blaine Gabbert had been improving, throwing for 318 yards against Arizona, while his top receiver Anquan Boldin had recorded 44 catches for 558 yards, 28 of which resulted in first downs. However, the San Francisco offense had the fewest points in the NFL with 152, a league-low 14 combined touchdowns, and a worst-ranked 31 plays of at least 20 yards. Meanwhile, the Bears had allowed an average of 17 points per game in the last five, the fourth-fewest in the league. Marquess Wilson, Eddie Royal, Antrel Rolle, Nick Becton, Jacoby Glenn, Antone Smith and Bruce Gaston were inactive.|$|E
