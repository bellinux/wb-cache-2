25|$|The <b>dominant</b> <b>land</b> {{tenure in}} the Great Western Woodlands is Unallocated Crown Land (UCL), which makes up 60% of the area. UCL {{is the lowest}} {{category}} of land classification under Western Australian state law – sometimes called ‘orphan country’. Pastoral leases cover 20% of the area. Conservation reserves of various types represent about 15% of the region, with Class A conservation protection over 3.6% of the land, Class B on 4.5% and Class C on 4.5%. Class B and C reserves have relatively little security of tenure, while Class A reserves require parliamentary approval for any tenure changes. The remaining land in the Great Western Woodlands is divided between shire reserves, Crown reserves and freehold land.|$|E

500|$|During the Permian period synapsids, {{including}} {{the ancestors of}} mammals, may have dominated land environments, but the Permian–Triassic extinction event [...] {{came very close to}} wiping out complex life. The extinctions were apparently fairly sudden, at least among vertebrates.

One archosaur group, the dinosaurs, were the <b>dominant</b> <b>land</b> vertebrates {{for the rest of the}} Mesozoic, and birds evolved from one group of dinosaurs. During this time mammals' ancestors survived only as small, mainly nocturnal insectivores, but this apparent set-back may have accelerated the development of mammalian traits such as endothermy and hair.

2500|$|The locale of St Johns Wood {{comprises}} portions 165, 166, 381 and 382 in the Parish of Enoggera, Brisbane. The land on {{the western}} perimeter of St Johns Wood identified as Portion 382 being an area of , 1 rod and 16 perches was originally purchased 10 August 1864 by Joseph Berry. This land remained intact until subdivision in the 1980s. The land had been bought by Blue Metal & Gravel (BMG Resources Ltd.) who also owned the quarry on the opposite southern side of Waterworks Road, (where [...] stands today) {{with the intention of}} quarrying the site. In the 1970s there was enormous opposition to the quarry on the southern {{side of the road and}} BMG made the decision not to quarry the St Johns Wood site. Several attempts were made to subdivide the land including one in which it was to be subdivided into 60 townhouse sites. When these attempts proved fruitless the land was put up for sale and was purchased in 1984 by local real estate agent Syd Appleby and his wife Merryl and Allan and Maree Rainbow. They initially subdivided the land into 23 lots with the Applebys and the Rainbows retaining the largest two lots of 2.5 acres each in the north-western corner. The first purchasers of the subdivided land were airline pilot, Richard Kleeman and his wife Sue and Professor Peter Coaldrake and his wife Dr. Lee Coaldrake. Soon after their houses were built and they moved in, the Coaldrakes and the Applebys traded houses, with the Coaldrakes then owning the larger block in the north west corner next to the Rainbows. In 1991, the Coaldrakes and Rainbows decided to subdivide their two lots into six lots. Their properties had access with two other lots under a reciprocal easement arrangement. One of the owners demanded one hundred and thirty thousand dollars on payment to allow the subdivision to proceed without challenge. When this demand was rejected the owner took the matter to the Supreme Court where she lost the case. She continued to demand the money and appealed the court decision. This decision was upheld and the case proceeded to the High Court where it was again upheld. This case became and remains a landmark case on easements in Australian and British law. The issue was: When a dominant block is subdivided does each of the subdivided parts gain the benefit of the easement? The High Court held that it did only if it was of benefit to the subdivided parts. They emphasised the point that an easement is not a personal right, it belongs to land, it attaches to <b>dominant</b> <b>land</b> for the benefit of that land. If it benefits each of the subdivided parts, it is attached to them and does belong to them.|$|E

25|$|Critical {{developments}} of the Jagiellonian period were concentrated during Casimir IV's long reign, which lasted until 1492. In 1454, Royal Prussia was incorporated by Poland and the Thirteen Years' War of 1454–66 with the Teutonic state ensued. In 1466, the milestone Peace of Thorn was concluded. This treaty divided Prussia to create East Prussia, the future Duchy of Prussia, a separate entity that functioned as a fief of Poland under {{the administration of the}} Teutonic Knights. Poland also confronted the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Tatars in the south, and in the east helped Lithuania fight the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The country was developing as a feudal state, with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly <b>dominant</b> <b>landed</b> nobility. Kraków, the royal capital, was turning into a major academic and cultural center, and in 1473 the first printing press began operating there.

40|$|Land is {{a metaphor}} for power, wealth and status. Independent Gujarat's initial mass-development {{strategy}} centered on agriculture but the emphasis was on productivity and efficiency rather than land redistribution or social justice. A state apparatus and socio-political set-up dominated by elite landed upper and middle castes and classes ensured this. Primary fieldwork-based research shows that by the mid- 1980 s, with a growing acceptance of ideas of liberalisation at the national and international level, the elite consensus on land began to shift. This shift must also be placed within local socio-economic developments that had propelled <b>dominant</b> <b>landed</b> groups into agro-industry and small scale industry in the last third of the twentieth century. Gujarat's elite still wanted to control land, but they did not want the state to regulate land use or continue emphasising the diluted but powerful rhetoric of land to the tiller. The rightward shift of all political formations in Gujarat after 1985 and the growing importance of the upper caste-middle class merchant-trader-builder-small businessman dominated Bharatiya Janata Party further facilitated the moves towards a shift in land policy. Continuing changes in Gujarat's land policy are determinedly moving towards the complete liberalisation of land...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of strikingly low {{literacy}} rates among Indian women and low caste population, the paper explores whether and how far {{the interests of the}} marginalized poor are undermined by the dominant elite consisting mainly of the landed and the capitalists. We distinguish the dominant elite from the minority elite (i. e., elected women and low caste representatives in the ruling government) and also the marginalised as measured by the state poverty rate. Results based on the Indian state-level data suggest that a higher share of land held by the top 5 % of the population lowers public spending on education while presence of capitalist elite, as reflected in greater degree of industrialisation enhances it, even in poorer states; the landed elite thus appears to be unresponsive to the underlying poverty rate. The effect of minority representation in the government appears to have a limited impact, indicating a possibility of their non-accountability to serve their cohorts and/or a possible alliance with the dominant elite. literacy among women and low caste, <b>dominant</b> <b>landed</b> and capitalist elite, minority elite, poor and the marginalised, education spending, development and non-development spending, India...|$|R
