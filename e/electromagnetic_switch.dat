During operation with closed contacts (4) of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>switch</b> (5), the semiconducting switch drive is at least temporarily interrupted to avoid the high voltage drop across the mechanical contacts caused by increased contact resistance. This blocks the semiconducting switch when increased contact resistance occurs and hence increases the voltage at the mechanical contact.

The system is effective to control the intelligent air –cushion system with measuring the vehicle traction force (TF), motion resistance (MR), cushion clearance height (CH) and cushion pressure (CP). Ultrasonic displacement sensor, pull-in solenoid <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>switch,</b> pressure control sensor, micro controller, and battery pH sensor are incorporated with the Fuzzy logic system to investigate experimentally the TF, MR, CH, and CP. In this study, a comparison for tractive performance of an intelligent air cushion track vehicle has been performed with the results obtained from the predicted values of FLS and experimental actual values. The mean relative error of actual and predicted values from the FLS model on traction force, and total motion resistance are found as 5. 58 %, and 6. 78 % respectively. For all parameters, the relative error of predicted values are found to be less than the acceptable limits. The goodness of fit of the prediction values from the FLS model on TF, and MR are found as 0. 90, and 0. 98 respectively.

Furthermore, based on the performance simulations of the SFCL equipped with this high-speed switch, the SFCL is able to quickly and availably suppress the fault current contributed by the DG units in the micro-grid system, and meanwhile improve the voltage sag and reduce the frequency fluctuations. As a result, the suggested SFCL’s service practicability can be well confirmed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} semi-passive switching shunt control for electro-magneto-mechanically coupled flexible structures. This simple system consists of a permanent magnet attached to an aluminum beam and a coil placed below the magnet with a switching circuit connected {{to the end of}} the coil. The MATLAB Simulink program and dSPACE hardware were employed for realizing the switching mechanism. Switching is done between open-circuit and short-circuits states. When the structure moves away from equilibrium, the circuit is short circuited, thereby dissipating energy, subsequently the system returns back to open circuit state. This novel self-sensing <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>switching</b> damper was compared with the traditional laser-sensing method for vibration control of the structure. The results show that the proposed semi-passive switching shunt damper can be successfully applied to minimize the magnitude of vibrating flexible structures...|$|R

This paper outlines one feasible pathway to fill a glaring gap in public transport within our cities and do this whereas addressing a number of pressing social, environmental, and economic needs including providing transport users {{an alternative to the}} car and truck, reducing congestion in cities, promoting renewable energy sources, returning ‘people space’ to cities and suburbs, and making it a healthier and happier space to name a few. The pathway outlined in this paper involves using a fully-automated small vehicle system called Gazelle. The system uses linear motors for propulsion and an air cushion for frictionless levitation of the vehicle. Contactless <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>switching</b> allows the vehicles to be routed across the track network. It is selfsufficient in renewable energy.

This thesis has sought to quantify the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>switching</b> transient implications of integrating very large volumes of embedded generation into the UK's low-voltage supply networks. Laboratory testing of a converter-interfaced PV source has been undertaken to characterise typical switching transient waveshapes, and equivalent representative source models have been constructed in EMTP-ATP. A detailed frequency-dependent travelling wave equivalent of the DNO-approved Generic UK LV Distribution network model has been developed and, by means of extensive statistical simulation studies, used to quantify the cumulative impact of geographically localised generators switching in response to common network conditions. It is found that the magnitude of generator-induced voltage and current transients is dependent on the number of concurrently switched generators, and on their relative locations within the network. A theoretical maximum overvoltage of 1. 72 pu is predicted at customer nodes remote from the LV transformer terminals, for a scenario in which all households have installed embedded generation. Latent diversity in switch pole closing and inrush inception times is found to reduce predicted peak transient voltages to around 25 - 40 % of their theoretical maxima.
