Treatments selected simulated conditions the seed might {{be exposed to}} in its natural environment, including dry afterripening, scarification, leaching, and cold stratification. Ger-mination response to individual treatments was equal to or higher than nontreated seed. Germination percentage of afterripened seed was increased from 17 % for nontreated <b>filled</b> <b>seed</b> {{to an average of}} 86 % of <b>filled</b> <b>seed</b> by the combined treatments of scarification, leaching, and 4 -week stratification. This combination of treat-ments allowed optimum germination. Response to treatments provided evidence as to the type of dormancy in Gardner saltbush seeds. The levels of germination response to specific treatments appears to be an adaptation to ensure a temporal dispersal of dormancy release and seedling emergence. Pregermination treat-ments used in this study were relatively easy to apply to the seeds and stimulated germination without potentially damaging the embryo. Thus, they would be useful in revegetation by direct seeding efforts. Gardner saltbush [Atriplexgurdneri (Moq.) D.

Inconsistent seed (achenes) quality {{and the lack of}} methods to discriminate between good and bad seed lots are significant problems, allowing commercial stands to be established only by transplants, rather than by more cost effective direct-seeding. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate why guayule seed and seed lots vary significantly in quality. The laboratory and greenhouse experiments involved separation of seed based on physical attributes (diameter, color and weight) and the confirmation of internal structures (embryo and endosperm) by x-ray analysis. The effect of different conditioning treatments on seed lots was also tested. Separation of seed by size (diameter) was shown to be less efficient than separation by color. Color was the most effective means of separating heavier and darker (opaque-black and gray color grades) seed, and these seed were confirmed to be filled, containing internal structures by x-ray analysis. Germination percentage and rate were greater for seed with these characteristics than for yellow and bright-black seed, which are lighter and predominately partially filled or unfilled. Conditioning treatments used for guayule seed older than two years had no effect on seed germination and emergence percentage or rate. However, differences in germination and emergence were found among lines, therefore, differences among seed lots appear to be due to variation in the number of <b>filled</b> <b>seed.</b> The quality of seed lots was significantly improved when seed were separated based on color first, then by weight. The separation of good quality seed (filled) from poor quality seed (unfilled) is crucial to lower the costs of stand establishment by direct seeding.

To study {{the effects of}} the hydrological regimes of lakes and rivers on seed size of wild rice (Zizania palustris), four lakes and four rivers were sampled to measure and model the factors affecting seed size. Based on casual observation by harvesters and biologists it has been hypothesized that seeds produced in riverine habitats are smaller than those produced in lacustrine habitats. We found mean seed mass in lake populations was 15. 4 mg (41 %) larger than in river populations. When seed mass was partitioned between water body type, regional population pair, and individual population, water body type accounted for 71. 3 % of the variance. Data collected on seed mass, panicle density, seed scars, root mass, sediment characteristics, and water depths were used to create a statistical model to quantify the effects of each factor on seed size. The two most important environmental factors contributing to seed size were sediment bulk density and water depth at seed collection.

The leaves grow throughout the year and growth is positively correlated to temperature and day length; at flowering, the growth rate slows down. The plants have a reproductive cycle lasting 9 - 10 months; male plants form more branches and strobili than females, female strobili are larger than male ones. Both male and female plants produce cones that differ in {{the color of the}} covering bracts. Plants produce a lot of seeds, but most of them are empty; therefore the seed/ovule ratio is low. <b>Filled</b> and empty <b>seeds</b> are morphologically similar; <b>filled</b> <b>seeds</b> have high vitality that is maintained for several years. As probable causes of the low seed/ovule ratio, both pollination and embryo abortion are taken into account; our observations lead us to believe that the embryo abortion hypothesis is more accurate.

The planted material consisted of ten sunflower inbred lines (Parents) and their nine crosses. Highly significant genetic differences were observed among the inbred liens for head weight per plant, seed weight per head, 1000 -seed weight and harvest index, however, the differences among the inbred lines for the weight of <b>filled</b> <b>seeds</b> per head were statistically non significant. Genetic differences among the hybrids were significant for all characters except for head weight per plant. High levels of heterosis were observed for the hybrids TS- 17 xTR- 120 and TS- 18 xTR- 120 for important agronomic characters such as head weight per plant (184 and 183 %, respectively), seed weight per head (322. 3 and 292. 7 %, respectively) and weight of <b>filled</b> <b>seeds</b> per head (302. 7 and 295. 5 %, respectively).

40|$|Many {{long-lived}} perennial species exhibit lowered reproductive capacity. Early {{studies of}} reproductive success in Dedeckera eurekensis (Polygonaceae) {{demonstrated that the}} species exhibited extremely low reproductive success, low seed/ovule (S/O) ratios (i. e., the percentage of ovules that produce filled seeds; 2. 5 %), low germinability of filled seeds (3. 5 %), low seedling survivorship (11. 1 %), and lack of recruitment in natural populations. These results were attributed to genetic load, but this elicited controversy, prompting long-term studies {{of the relationship between}} the S/O ratio and environment. After nine years of monitoring, however, the S/O ratio had not changed significantly (2. 7 %), and there was no significant correlation between precipitation and the S/O ratio. Controlled field experiments demonstrated that neither resource availability nor other ecological factors significantly influenced embryo abortion rates. Controlled self-pollinations (N = 115) matured only one questionably <b>filled</b> <b>seed,</b> whereas intrapopulation cross-pollinations (N = 192) produced significantly more seed (S/O = 12. 0 %). Previous pollination studies demonstrated that the species has no primary pollinators and is only rarely visited by a few generalist insects. However, the flowers typically self-pollinate in 2 — 3 days following anthesis. Strong inference suggests that the loss of reproductive capacity in D. eurekensis may be the result of inbreeding depression due to the superimposition of self-pollination on a normally outcrossed species carrying a high genetic/segregational load...|$|E

In this paper, combining ability, gene action and genetic analysis of several characteristics were studied for five sunflower inbred lines and their ten hybrids (fifteen genotypes). The materials were evaluated in two separate experiments using a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications in well-watered and waterstressed states and in field condition. Data were analyzed by Griffing’s diallel analysis model 1 (fixed effects) and method 2 (parents and crosses). Combined analysis of experiments revealed significant differences among genotypes for all studied traits. Combining ability analysis revealed that in well-watered conditions, general and specific combining abilities (GCA and SCA) effects were significant for all studied traits except for the leaf number. In water-stressed condition, GCA and SCA effects were significant for all studied traits except for the head and stem diameter.

The factors were three planting dates (4 th of November, 4 th of December 2013 and 3 th of January 2014) and four planting densities (8, 12, 16 and 18 plant/m 2). The results showed that planting dates significantly affected on phenology, yield and its components, <b>seed</b> <b>filling</b> rate and periods while the effect of plant density on <b>seed</b> <b>filling</b> period was not significant. Comparison of sigmoid equation coefficients showed that <b>seed</b> <b>filling</b> rates in three planting dates were different.

To determine the best transplanting dates for double cropping of Tarom mahalli in Mazandaran, a field experiment was carried out in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicaties in Amol in 2014. Treatments were: 24 transplanting dates beginning from June 28 to September 5 with intervals of three days. The results of analysis of variance indicated that there were significant differences among different transplanting dates for all agronomic traits and grain yield at 1 % probability levels. Delaying transplanting increased unfilled grain number per panicle and decreased other agronomic traits including seed yield. The highest grain yield (with an average of 3975. 2 kg. ha- 1) was obtained at 1 st of July transplanting date. This was due to the increase in the number of seeds (80. 3), number of <b>filled</b> <b>seed</b> per panicle (72) and panicle number per plant (18. 3). The lowest grain yield (with an average of 38. 5 kg. ha- 1) was obtained at the 5 th of September transplanting. Early transplanting decreased days to different phonological stages (days to tillering, 50 % flowering and maturity). Delay in transplanting, however, reduced daily temperature, increased number of days to the developmental stages and thus decreased seed yield. Early July transplanting due to suitable temperatures and radiation for flowering and lack of heavy rainfall increased seed yield of rice.

Urmia University, in 2004. The main factor, sub factor and sub-sub factor in our experiment were: 1. two cultivars, Uroflor and Alstar, 2. defoliation at four reproduction stages, star shape of inflorescence (R 2 ), pollination stage (R 5 ), seed setting initiation (R 6 ) and final period of seed setting (R 7 ), and 3. four defoliation intensities (0 % as an undefoliated control, 25 %, 50 % and 75 %). Seeding was accomplished on May 23. Average triple factor interactions verified that different defoliations at R 2 stage have significantly reduced seed yield and oil percentage of both Uroflor and Alstar cultivars. Out of this reduction, 75 percent defoliation at R 2 was the most, while at R 5 and R 6 stages 50 and 75 defoliation caused significant reduction on seed yield in comparison with control. At R 7 stage different defoliations had no significant effect on seed yield of Uroflor cultivar, while, on Alstar cultivar, 75 percent defoliation at R 7 stage caused significant difference in relation to control. Also average triple interaction among factors showed that none of defoliation percentages had significant effect on oil percentage. In view of the fact that, seed development and filling occurred after defoliation at R 2 and R 5 , the most variation resulted from defoliation of valued traits like number of <b>filled</b> <b>seed</b> per head and weight of 1000 seeds, observed at R 2 and R 5 stages and consequently reduced seed and oil yields. On the bases of this experiment it could be concluded that sunflower cultivation with losses of 50 and 75 percent will be economically unprofitable and it will be more desirable to replace it with any other suitable crop in the region...|$|E

Cones were collected from the upper one-third and lower one-third crown positons of pruned and nonpruned raiets (three each) from six clones. Estimates of s were derived from a maximum likelihood procedure using data from 10 allozyme loci (PGII, LAP 1, LAP 2, GOT 2, GOT 3, GLYDH, CAT, 6 PGD, IDH, and DIA). The six clones sampled varied significantly (P < 0. 05) both in s and PF, but estimates of PF and s were not significantly correlated among clones. On the average, seeds from the upper portion of the crown were lower in s (0. 055) and higher in PF (0. 512) than seeds from the lower crown (s = 0. 190, PF = 0. 381). Combined over crown positions, pruning appeared to have little effect on s, while pruned ramets (PF = 0. 432) had only a slightly lower <b>filled</b> <b>seed</b> proportion than nonpruned ramets (PF = 0. 461). A total crown estimate of the proportion of viable progeny due to selffertilization from the six sampled clones was about 10 percent. These results show that crown position of cones, top-pruning, and clonal variation are all factors which could influence orchard management practices and the utilization of orchard seeds. Although the average proportion of viable progeny resulting from selffertilization in the seed orchard appeared to be no greater than that found in natural populations, information on clonal variation {{may be useful in}} roguing decisions. It may be desirable to remove clones which are consistently high selfers and low seed producers; or perhaps seed from these clones should be excluded from commercial collections. In addition, orchard managers may consider not collecting lower crown cones because of the lower seed yields and greater proportions of self seed found in the lower crown. In this study, the effects of top-pruning orchard ramets on seed set or self ing appeared to be minimal, but {{it remains to be seen}} whether there is a relationship between severity of top-pruning and seed quality or quantity...|$|E

Maximum grain yield of 437. 2 g m - 2 was attained by early planted crop (May 10). The rate of decrease in grain yield was noted about 22. 5 g m - 2 reduction with one week delay in sowing. Grain yield increased 38 % with increase in plant density from 20 to 60 plants m - 2 and maximum grain yield of 433. 0 g m - 2 was recorded at 60 plants m - 2. Significant Relationship (r = 0. 93, p< 0. 01) between biological yield at early <b>seed</b> <b>filling</b> stage (R 5) and grain yield indicate that greater total dry matter results in greater seed yield if the total dry matter is produced before <b>seed</b> <b>filling</b> period. No NAR differences were observed among planting dates during vegetative stage and early reproductive stage (early flowering to early <b>seed</b> <b>filling)</b> and LAI during vegetative stage (emergence to early flowering) was 16. 66 % greater for late sowing date, therefore more dry matter accumulation at early <b>seed</b> <b>filling</b> stage (R 5) for early planted soybean is commonly due to greate LAI during early reproductive period (R 1 to R 5). No NAR differences were observed among plant densities during vegetative stage (emergence to early flowering), therefore more dry matter accumulation at early <b>seed</b> <b>filling</b> stage (R 5) for highest plant density is commonly due to greater LAI during emergence to early <b>seed</b> <b>filling</b> and greater NAR during early reproductive stage (R 1 to R 5).

Thousand Grain Weight (TGW) was determined {{for each of the}} abore seed types within a sample. Seed was uniformly dewinged before weighing. Both these methodical aspects, namlely, the exact determination of the seed quality and the uniform dewinging of the material, are basic requirements for obtaining correct TGW values. In order to study the relationships between TGW and seed origin,the localities of the autochthonous provenances were divided into seven geographical regions: 1. Polish, 2. Sudetian, 3. Slovakian, 4. Rumanian, 5. Eastern Alpine, 6. Central Alpine, and 7. Western Alpine. The first four regions lie isolated from one another, whereas the remaining three form a continuous area of the Alpine larch. The average altitude of the regions 1 - 7 increases from east to west (excluding Rumanian larch). For TGW of larch, the following relationships have been found: (1) TGW values of <b>filled</b> <b>seed</b> lie between 3. 73 - 10. 81 grams. There is a direct relationship between the TGW and the average altitude of a region. The differences among the regions are gradual, i. e. the greater the difference betmeen the average altitutdes of two geographic regions, the farther apart lie the TGW values. The TGW for a particular altitude was found to be greater the higher the mountain massif in a region. (2) The TGW of empty seeds is about 70 per cent of that of filled ones. There was a tendency that with increasing altitude of the provenances, the relatire weight of the empty seeds also increased. (3) The TGW value of insect-attacked seeds was about 74. 4 per cent of that of filled oncs. The insect-attacked seeds occurred chiefly in the provenances from low elevations. (4) The TGW values do not change even after the provenances have been introduced into other localities. Thus, TGW is genetically strongly fixed and only slightly modified by external factors. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results: The effectiveness of the various methods for separating the empty and the insect-attacked seeds from the filled ones can easily he checked by x-ray radiography. Of course, for practical purpose {{it is not necessary to}} remove empty seeds from the sample, if the density of sowing is estimated on the number of filled seeds. In view of the fact that TGW values of larch seed from different geographical regions are constant and specific, they could be used as a criterion for the identification of the origin of larch. However, the TGW variation among the regions has a c 1 inal character. which makes it difficult or impossible to determine the origin of provenance material lying on the boundary of two neighbouring regions. Chiefly in addition to other characters (e. g. form and size of cones, colour of flowers, etc.), TGW can be useful for the identification of the origin of larch.

It {{has the ability to}} dramatically reduce the productivity of pastures, as well as cause a range of allergy and respiratory diseases for both livestock and people. It has also become an important cropping weed and significantly disrupted native community biodiversity. In Australia, parthenium weed is currently {{one of the most important}} invasive weeds and is predominantly found in Queensland. Clearly, there is a need to understand thoroughly the effects of several environmental parameters upon the reproductive biology of parthenium weed, the effects of climate change variables upon the weed’s early growth, the mechanisms of the weed spread, seed persistence, and the impact of parthenium weed upon plant biodiversity. Insights into these aspects may allow us to model and hence, predict the invasion potential of parthenium weed and thereby, to manage the weed more effectively and successfully. Warm (35 / 28 ºC, day/night), as compared to cool growth conditions (25 / 18 ºC, day/night), advanced the developmental process of parthenium weed, speeding up its life cycle, its time to flowering and fruiting commencement, and promoting height attainment and biomass accumulation. This change of temperature also promoted the reproductive ability of the plant, increasing its seed production capacity, the <b>filled</b> <b>seed</b> percentage, promoting the proportion of dormant seeds and producing seed with the capacity to live longer in the soil seed bank. Under an elevated CO 2 concentration (550 ppmv), coupled with a cooler (30 / 15 ºC, day/night), wetter soil condition (field capacity), the early plant growth of two biotypes (Clermont and Toogoolawah) was greatly promoted over that seen under the same conditions but under an ambient CO 2 concentration (390 ppmv). However, growth was not significantly increased under elevated CO 2 conditions when the early growth was under warm conditions (35 / 20 ºC, day/night). In addition, the species composition and the dynamics of the soil seed bank were studied at two sites (Moolayember Creek and Clermont) in central Queensland. Parthenium weed was significantly reducing the community diversity, the species richness, the Shannon-Weiner index and the evenness index. However, the impact of parthenium weed at the Moolayember Creek site was less than that seen at the two Clermont sub-sites. When considered over a 15 year period, the initially declining parthenium weed seed bank at the Moolayember Creek site had more recently plateaued. Unfortunately, very little improvement in the overall size of the seed bank of the palatable fodder plants had occurred there. At the Clermont sites, the parthenium weed seed bank was still increasing gradually in size. Furthermore, the seed bank of grass species remained extremely low and this site seemed to be unstable and undergoing a continued decline in biological quality. The spread of weed seed (including that of parthenium weed) on vehicles was studied over a three year period. Material washed off vehicles at off-road wash down facilities, taken from five sites in central Queensland, in each of the four seasons of the year showed that the average total number of viable seeds t- 1 of dry sludge was ca. 67, 000. A typical wash down facility was removing up to ca. 335, 000 viable seeds from vehicles per week. Parthenium weed was present in the sludge at all five facilities, with an average of 1, 340 seeds t- 1 of dry sludge. A typical wash down facility was removing up to 4, 000 viable parthenium weed seeds per week. Moreover, the viability of parthenium weed seeds in water was measured in distilled, river, and sludge water at temperatures ranging from 10 to 34 ºC and in solutions of different pH (4 to 9 of pH levels) at temperature ranging from 15 to 30 ºC, for between 0 to 45 days. The viability of parthenium weed seeds was still high after 45 days in distilled and river water especially when the temperature of those solutions was low. This viability of parthenium weed seeds was less in sludge water. The higher the temperature of the water and the longer the seeds were in the water, the lower the subsequent seed viability observed. Warmth elevated the rate of seed viability decline but seeds would be predicted to remain viable for up to 20 days in river water. For the viability of seeds in different pH solutions, the higher the temperature of the solution and the longer the seeds were in it, the lower was their viability but these outcomes did not depend upon the pH of the solution. Finally, the impact of parthenium weed upon botanical community diversity was assessed in areas infested with different densities of the weed (i. e. high, low and no parthenium weed) at a pastoral site in Kilcoy, Queensland, Australia. The importance value index and the relative density of native species were lowest at the high density of parthenium weed site and highest at the no parthenium weed site and the species diversity and the community evenness decreased as the parthenium weed infestation levels increased, both in summer and in winter, both in the above-ground community and in the soil seed bank. This study has shown that components of a changing climate, including elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration, warmer temperatures and drier soils are likely to promote the growth and reproductive capacity of parthenium weed, as well modify quality components of its seed. Such changes brought about by climate change would also aid the weed persistence in the environment, therefore promoting its longer-term invasive potential. In combination with these advantages, the spread of the weed’s seeds by vehicles and water is also likely to increase. The stimulation of growth and increased competitiveness of the weed will also lead to a greater suppression of native community biodiversity. All of these findings strongly suggest that the problems associated with parthenium weed will increase in Australia and around the world in the future...|$|E
40|$|A {{factorial}} experiment, {{based on}} RCB design, with three replications {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of rhizobial inoculation, urea, and weeds on soybean performance in the field. The factors under study consisted of inoculation and non-inoculation, three levels of 0, 150, and 300 kg/ha urea, and weed-control and weed-infestation. Results showed that weed-control, inoculation and urea application increased biological and seed yield. The highest effect on yield was due to weed control, followed by inoculation and urea application. Inoculation, weed-control and urea application of 300 kg/ha enhanced protein percentage in soybean grains. In this case, inoculation had the highest effect on protein percentage, followed by urea application and weed control. In contrast, only weed-control significantly increased seed oil percentage. <b>Seed</b> <b>filling</b> rate increased {{as a result of}} inoculation, but, <b>seed</b> <b>filling</b> duration was not affected by inoculation.

The objective {{of this study was}} to compare genetic variability and relationships among traits between hybrids and inbreds genotypes. Crossing between 2 A-lines and 6 R-lines were done for the experiment. The experiment was performed in Augmented in RCBD with three replications. Broad sense heritability and genetic advance of hybrids were higher than inbreds in number of tillers, number of <b>filled</b> <b>seeds</b> per panicle, plant height and grain yield. Genotypic correlation indicated that grain yield of hybrids had high positive correlation with number of productive tillers, number of <b>filled</b> <b>seeds</b> per panicle, flag leaf length, plant height and harvest index. Inbred had high positive correlation in number of tillers, number of productive tillers and 1000 -seed weight. Path coefficient revealed that number of productive tillers, number of seeds per panicle, plant height and harvest index had positive direct effect on grain yield of hybrids. However, number of tillers, number of seeds per panicle, 1000 grain weight and flag leaf length had positive direct effect on grain yield for inbreds genotypes. Hence, number of productive tillers, number of seeds panicle - 1 and harvest index could be used for selection criteria of hybrid genotype...|$|R
40|$|Guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) is a rubber-producing shrub {{native to}} the {{semi-arid}} region of north central Mexico and southwestern Texas. Timely harvest is critical to achieve maximum seed viability, vigour, and yield. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate possible indicators of optimum seed maturity in guayule. The optimum harvest maturity time for guayule was studied by comparing quality parameters at different times after flowering. Heat units expressed as growing degree-days after flowering were calculated and related to seed development stages and quality. Seed quality at different stages of development was assessed by germination, capitulum dry mass, 1000 seed mass, and percentage of <b>filled</b> <b>seeds.</b> The maximum seed quality was recorded at 329 growing degree-days (GDD). This was 28 days from time of flowering. At this date, the moisture content of the capitulum was 48 % on a wet basis and the colour was comparable to cinnamon (Code 165 C) on the Royal Horticultural Society (R. H. S.) standard colour chart. Of all the parameters GDD, 1000 seed mass, and percentage of <b>filled</b> <b>seeds</b> provided a more rapid and reliable measure of optimum seed maturity. Colour identification can be used as an additional indicator. (C) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The fluxes of (1) {{exogenous}} nitrogen (N) {{assimilation and}} (2) remobilization of endogenous N from vegetative plant compartments were measured by 15 N labeling during the seed-filling period in pea (Pisum sativum L. cv Caméor), {{to better understand}} the mechanism of N remobilization. While the majority (86 %) of exogenous N was allocated to the vegetative organs before the beginning of <b>seed</b> <b>filling,</b> this fraction decreased to 45 % at the onset of <b>seed</b> <b>filling,</b> the remainder being directed to seeds. Nitrogen remobilization from vegetative parts contributed to 71 % of the total N in mature seeds borne on the first two nodes (first stratum). The contribution of remobilized N to total seed N varied, with the highest proportion at the beginning of filling; it was independent of the developmental stage of each stratum of seeds, suggesting that remobilized N forms a unique pool, managed at the whole-plant level and supplied to all <b>filling</b> <b>seeds</b> whatever their position on the plant. Once <b>seed</b> <b>filling</b> starts, N is remobilized from all vegetative organs: 30 % of the total N accumulated in seeds was remobilized from leaves, 20 % from pod walls, 11 % from roots, and 10 % from stems. The rate of N remobilization was maximal when seeds of all the different strata were filling, consistent with regulation according to the N demand of seeds. At later stages of <b>seed</b> <b>filling,</b> the rate of remobilization decreases and may become controlled by the amount of residual N in vegetative tissues...|$|R
40|$|Seed {{germination}} is poor {{in species}} of the nut-fruited Restionaceae. Investigations of seed morphology and development, seed collection and sorting, and seed viability were conducted in species of Cannomois Desv., Hypodiscus Nees and Willdenowia Thunb. to supplement existing knowledge, and to determine whether poor seed quality resulted in the poor seed germination identified in previous studies. Suitability of collection methods {{and the effectiveness of}} sorting techniques were evaluated using x-radiography. Shaking and ground collection methods yielded consistently higher proportions of full seed than extracting seed from cut shoots. However in species with bony bracts and few seeds per plant, the cutting method was more suitable. Floating was a better seed sorting technique than weighing for separating full from incompletely <b>filled</b> <b>seeds.</b> Seed viability in seed collections that had been sorted to contain only fully developed seeds was assessed using tetrazolium salts. Viability was generally high (mostly > 80 %), suggesting that poor germination in studies with well-sorted seeds is likely to be due to seed dormancy...|$|R
