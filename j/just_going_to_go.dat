2500|$|In an October {{election}} {{debate with}} Tester, regarding the Iraq War, Burns said that Tester [...] "says our president doesn't have a plan. I think he's got one. He's {{not going to}} tell everyone in the world", and later told Tester, [...] "We're {{not going to tell}} you what our plan is, Jon, because you're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and blow it." [...] These comments were likened by critics to then presidential candidate Richard Nixon's unfulfilled 1968 promise of a [...] "secret plan" [...] to end the war in Vietnam. Burns was also hurt politically when he confronted a U.S. Forest Service Hotshot Crew from Virginia at an airport about a fire.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2004 Daymond told WHAMMO.com.au [...] "I think [...] {{knew that}} we were looking to do {{something}} a little different. As a company they'd just gone through some major infrastructure changes {{in the last few years}} and I think by talking to us and realising that we were maybe not as happy as we were on the label when we signed – that the label had changed a lot and the roster was completely different". In an interview for Rolling Stone in May 2011, Thornton told music journalist, Andrew McMillen, that the band's manager at the time [...] "couldn’t be fucked fighting the label for anything that we wanted, and he'd made the decision that we were <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with whatever the label reckoned. Near the end, it was fucking soul-destroying for me".|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Gigwise when asked what influence The Holy Bible had on Futurology, frontman and singer James Dean Bradfield replied: [...] "That we could still trade in a language that is still exclusively ours, that we could still want to write songs that other people are <b>just</b> never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> near. I <b>just</b> don't think that anyone else would go near that subject matter. We never laid claim to being the most 'original' band, but I think we're unique in that sense." ...|$|R
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home and we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{announced}} by Sursok {{that she will}} be pursuing a career in music, with her debut single, [...] "Pointless Relationship", being released on November 14, 2004. The single was planned for a UK release on 5 September 2005 and then 19 September 2005, but was cancelled due to Tammin being contracted to a movie, which failed to materialize. [...] "My debut single [...] "Pointless Relationship" [...] is about a girl's view of where the relationship is going with her partner and it sounds like a negative term. But the song is more of an empowering song from a woman's perspective! It's the life of them together and it's <b>just</b> never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> where it should go, and so she's saying to him this is a pointless relationship." [...] — Tammin, on the song during an interview.|$|R
2500|$|In 2008, Brooks {{returned}} to EastEnders for a guest stint. She was later confirmed {{to be coming}} back as a regular character. She said, [...] "I had doubts to begin with, mainly because of Kiki, as I know how full-on EastEnders can be, and then there's that stigma {{about going back to}} a soap. But I'm so pleased I did, it was the right decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel really lucky to have a job and I need the security because of Kiki. I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back for a year, but I had a meeting with the boss last week and we're going to go for another year. So lots more time to get up to much mischief". Executive producer Diederick Santer said, [...] "I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining EastEnders. With her appearances last month, she reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine". She temporarily departed in September 2012, and returned in April 2013 before departing again in March 2014.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{featured in the}} March 21, 2012 issue of Kerrang! magazine, Bennington stated that the band has returned to more 'familiar' territory on their new record, saying [...] "with this [...] album, we've incorporated a lot of guitar work with big choruses and the heavier electronic stuff to give it that really big wall of sound feeling without getting too metal. This will be more familiar to people than A Thousand Suns was, where we were like 'Fuck it, we're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> bonkers." [...] Bennington {{also said that the}} new album's lyrics would be personal and avoid being political, adding [...] "We've been writing a lot about relationships." [...] Bennington and Shinoda echoed similar statements during {{an interview}} with Spin, with the former commenting that [...] "We now know we have the skills and the tools to take those ideas and make them into what we're actually looking for, as opposed to getting into it and discovering that it just sounds really nü-metal. That's always going to be gross to us, but we can take elements of that and reinvent the vibe, make it new and fresh." [...] The two previewed five songs from the album, as well as announced that they had collaborated with Canadian musician Owen Pallett. The vocalists also stated that they have adopted numerous influences and topics for the album, particularly about people.|$|E
6000|$|A {{tremendous}} tide of daring rose in Lemuel's breast.

5000|$|In the 1982 CBC {{television}} documentary Cruel Camera (produced by The Fifth Estate) Roy O. Disney, {{who was a}} cameraman on Perri's [...] "fenced in" [...] forest set, describes the film as both misrepresenting nature and being cruel to animals. Disney says, [...] "Well, you <b>just</b> aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out {{into the woods and}} set up a camera and wait for the squirrel to come." [...] He explains that the film used a cast of twenty tamed squirrels and [...] "a lot" [...] of wild ones, which were considered [...] "expendable." [...] Disney tells of one particular scene involving a chase with a marten, the film's [...] "arch-villain." [...] In the scene, one squirrel is eaten by the marten, however Disney says that in order to film the scene, they had to sacrifice a [...] "number of squirrels." [...] Practically speaking, [...] "they found a very simple way to film the heroine narrowly escaping predators: just film her not narrowly escaping at all, shout cut, then call for a fresh Perri." ...|$|R
5000|$|Trudeau's {{father was}} a deeply devout Roman Catholic and his mother {{converted}} from Anglicanism to Catholicism just prior to their wedding, although she studied Buddhism and now considers herself an Anglican. As a child, he attended mass each Sunday and said his prayers each night before bedtime. He became a lapsed Catholic at age 18, as he felt that much of his day-to-day life was not addressed by the formality {{and structure of the}} church. Trudeau described his faith during this period as [...] "like so many Catholics across this country, I said, 'OK, I'm Catholic, I'm of faith, but I'm <b>just</b> not really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church. Maybe on Easter, maybe midnight mass at Christmas. After the death of his brother Michel in 1998, Trudeau was persuaded by a friend to participate in an Alpha course, during which he regained his faith.|$|R
5000|$|The movie {{begins with}} Jane narrating {{about her life}} from her birth, to her first {{birthday}} and even her first day of kindergarten. Throughout the events, Jane talks about how overprotective her parents have been of her. The film jumps to Jane at age 15, starting her first day of high school. Although Jane appears {{to be happy and}} a normal teenage girl to her friends and family, inside she's feeling alone and different, particularly due to her lack of interest in boys which her friends take note of. Her feelings grow more confusing when a new girl named Taylor arrives in class (played by Alicia Lagano) who Jane sees (and says in a voice over) as [...] "different, smarter, wiser". She then continues to say in the voice over that [...] "maybe because she wasn't from here or maybe it was <b>just</b> her.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} for The Electricity Club site, Marnie said: [...] "I played around {{with the idea for}} a couple of years and joked about it for while. I had a handful of songs and when Ladytron had some time off last year, I began to believe it could be a reality. I thought if I have the opportunity, I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> for it. So I started writing as much as I could." ...|$|E

You’re <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> jump into strange people, so you bump into the chaplain and he’s teaching you all that strange stuff and then, I don’t know, you grow up and then you’ve got these cool stories about the mad chaplain at your school.|$|R
5000|$|Last year, Wayne Rainey {{lost any}} {{chance at the}} {{championship}} by crashing on this track, and this year he has a points advantage on Kevin Schwantz, but a DNF would just about erase the lead. He’s asked:Q: “Is this <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be one of the}} occasions when you go for points rather than a win?”WR: “Well, I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> for both; it’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be tough tomorrow for those guys that have been going fast—if they go the same speed tomorrow; so we’re <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ride around, have some fun and collect all the points we can get.”Q: “You’ll be satisfied then if you don’t win?”WR: “No.” ...|$|R

[...] Chris said, ‘How about calling the band Truly?’ Mark was at work, and Jonathan Poneman said, ‘Why don’t you call your band Truly?’ Two {{different}} people came up with the same name - I figured that was fate." ...|$|E
5000|$|After One Direction {{went on a}} hiatus, Liam, who co-wrote {{songs on}} each of the group's five albums, {{intended}} to focus only on songwriting. He told Billboard: To be honest with you, I wasn't going to do a solo venture. I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into songwriting and carry on and do that. But then I was like, 'You've been trying to do this since you were 14 years old. You would be ridiculously stupid to turn down the option to have a deal.' Coming out of the band, we had some pretty good opportunities around us. I had to do something.|$|E
50|$|Ishmael {{proceeds}} to tease from his pupil {{the premises of}} the story (i.e. myth) being enacted by the Takers: {{that they are the}} pinnacle of evolution, that the world was made for man, and that man is here to conquer and rule the world. This rule is meant to bring about a paradise, as man increases his mastery of the world, however, he is always failing because he is flawed. Man doesn't know how to live and never will because that knowledge is unobtainable.
