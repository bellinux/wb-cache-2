50|$|Continued {{emphasis}} on improving productivity {{in the mines}} {{led to the development}} of the first automatic, power-driven grease gun to be marketed commercially. Used for lubricating the mine cars, the unit included a 400 Lb pressurized tank, one or more <b>hoses</b> and <b>valves</b> that automatically dispensed a predetermined amount of grease. The first Lincoln Lubrigun, introduced in 1923, was mounted on a mine car truck.|$|R
50|$|A {{method by}} which a large one-way check valve is {{inserted}} {{just prior to the}} throttle body, enabling air to bypass the turbo, intercooler, and piping during periods where there is negative air pressure at the throttle body inlet. This results in more air combusting, which means more air driving the turbine side of the turbo. As soon as positive pressure is reached in the intercooler <b>hosing,</b> the <b>valve</b> closes.|$|R
50|$|The wing is an {{inflatable}} buoyancy bladder, {{similar to that}} in other varieties of BCD, except that it is not in or permanently attached to the harness part of a BCD. As with other BCDs, wings have an inflation valve on a corrugated <b>hose,</b> dump <b>valve,</b> and over pressure valve. Wings are usually oval (annular, doughnut or toroidal) or U-shaped (horseshoe), and are designed to wrap slightly around the diving cylinder(s) when inflated.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} twin-hose regulators {{usually had}} no ports for accessories, though some {{has a high}} pressure port for a submersible pressure gauge. Some later models have one or more low-pressure ports between the stages, {{which can be used}} to supply direct feeds for suit or BC inflation and/or a secondary single <b>hose</b> demand <b>valve,</b> and a high pressure port for a submersible pressure gauge. The new Mistral is an exception as {{it is based on the}} Aqualung Titan first stage. which has the usual set of ports.|$|R
40|$|The {{handling}} of abstract materials and mechanisms {{to pick and}} place are widely found in factory automation and industrial manufacturing. There are different mechanical grippers {{which are based on}} different motor technologies have been designed and employed in numerous applications. The designed robotic gripper in this paper is a two jaw actuated gripper which is different from the conventional cam and follower gripper in the way that controlled movement of the jaws is done with the help of pneumatic cylinders using air pressure. The force developed in the cylinder is very gentle and is directly delivered to the jaws in a compact way. The design, analysis and fabrication of the gripper model are explained in details along with the detailed list of all existing pneumatic grippers in market. The force and torque for the gripper have been calculated for different set of conditions. The working of the model is checked for and observation for pay load is recorded at various pressures. The highly dynamic and highly accelerated gripper model can be easily set at intermediate positions by regulating the pressure. Pneumatic grippers are very easy to handle and are generally cost-effective because air <b>hoses,</b> <b>valves</b> and other pneumatic devices are easy to maintain...|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "boss" [...] {{ground joint}} {{coupling}} <b>valve</b> <b>hose</b> coupling, primarily used for compressed air or steam. It {{consists of a}} stem, wing nut and spud. It seals as a soft copper seat located in the spud is drawn against the stem by tightening the wing nut.|$|R

Other available materials include silicone, rubber compounds, galvanized steel, and nylon. It is primarily used to connect <b>hoses</b> to <b>valves,</b> water pumps and deck drains. A 45ยบ elbow, {{also known as}} a [...] "45 bend" [...] or [...] "45 ell", is commonly used in water-supply facilities, food, chemical and electronic industrial pipeline networks, air-conditioning pipelines, agriculture and garden production, and solar-energy facility piping.|$|R
5000|$|A {{bell prover}} (commonly {{referred}} to in the industry as a [...] "bell") consists of a vertical inner tank surrounded by an outer shell. A space between the inner tank and outer shell is filled with a sealing liquid, usually oil. An inverted tank, called the bell, is placed over the inner tank. The liquid provides an air-tight seal. Bell provers are typically counterweighted to provide positive pressure through a <b>hose</b> and <b>valve</b> connected to a meter. Sometimes rollers or guides are installed on the moving part of the bell which allows for smooth linear movement without the potential for immeasurable pressure differentials caused by the bell rocking back or forth.|$|R

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{cylinder}} valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow {{to and from the}} pressure vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling <b>hose.</b> Cylinder <b>valves</b> are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal or plastic dip tube or valve snorkel screwed {{into the bottom of the}} valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator. Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.|$|R
50|$|When {{the risk}} of tank failure is not as likely or when it would not cause {{extensive}} damage, the bunding may be designed to merely contain small leaks from <b>hoses</b> and <b>valves.</b> This bunding {{may not be able}} to contain the entire volume of the tank. Plastic and steel are used, but another common method is making a hump or lip around the perimeter of a concrete floor. Some bunding is temporary, such as short-term chemical storage in the field. A hump or slope type bunding is helpful when vehicles need access to the area. There is also a type of bunding that compresses when a vehicle passes over and expands once it has passed.|$|R
5000|$|... 1995 {{model year}} engines had three {{features}} that set {{them apart from}} later engines. The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system utilized a plastic oil separator box that was vented directly to the block itself; the breather <b>hose</b> and PCV <b>valve</b> <b>hoses</b> attached to the box, and connected to the induction system. Later engines featured a PCV system that was molded to the cylinder head valve cover. The second feature was internal in nature - the crankshaft main bearings were keyed into the bedplate on the right rear of each transverse web. Later model years featured keys machined on the right front of each web. These considerations are important when considering a rebuild or replacement of this engine. The third feature would be a slightly bigger camshaft that was changed on 1996 and up SOHC vehicles due to a rough idle when the air conditioning was on. This 1995 model year cam is now being sold by dealers as a power upgrade for 1996 and up SOHC engines, {{but it can also}} easily be found at salvage yards for a low price.|$|R

50|$|Engineers paid {{particular}} attention to engine cooling, {{in order to make}} the radiator and its hoses as inconspicuous as possible, yet still function effectively. This was achieved by running the top radiator <b>hose</b> underneath a <b>valve</b> cover, and by situating a thin radiator between the downtubes of the double-cradle frame. The Fury was given a five-speed transmission and a shaft-drive system similar to its VTX predecessors, but the shaft was enclosed by an aluminum swingarm assembly unique to the Fury.|$|R
40|$|Two {{identical}} rubber balloons are partially inflated {{with air}} (to different extent) and {{connected by a}} <b>hose</b> with a <b>valve.</b> It is found that depending on balloon volumes, when the valve is opened the air will flow either from the larger (fuller) balloon to the smaller (emptier) balloon, or from the smaller balloon to the larger one. The phenomenon is {{explained in terms of}} the non-ideal rubber elasticity of balloons. The full phase diagram for the air flow dynamics is constructed...|$|R
25|$|The {{secondary}} {{demand valve}} {{can be a}} hybrid of a demand valve and a buoyancy compensator inflation valve. Both types are sometimes called alternate air sources. When the secondary demand valve is integrated with the buoyancy compensator inflation valve, since the inflation <b>valve</b> <b>hose</b> is short (usually {{just long enough to}} reach mid-chest), {{in the event of a}} diver running out of air, the diver with air remaining would give his or her primary second stage to the out-of-air diver, and switch to the inflation valve himself.|$|R

50|$|Inhalation {{closes the}} {{mouthpiece}} exhalation non-return valve and draws gas through the inhalation non-return valve. The pressure drop draws {{the contents of}} the outer bellows through the scrubber, inhalation <b>hose,</b> non-return <b>valve</b> and mouthpiece to the diver. As the concentric bellows contract, the pressure in the inner bellows increases and first closes the internal non-return valve, then pushes its contents through the outer non-return valve, discharging to the surroundings.When the bellows is fully contracted, the bottom cover triggers the gas addition valves which inject gas until the diver stops inhaling and the bottom cover no longer presses against the addition valve actuator.If the gas in the breathing circuit has been compressed by an increase in depth, the gas volume will be even less and the addition valves will be triggered for longer, bringing the volume back to the appropriate level. The RB80 uses two addition valves in parallel, so that if one fails, the other will provide the required gas.|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanic}} {{stands at}} a pit area outside the marked flight circle. The engine will be started and the model released at the start signal. For refuelling, the pilot will operate a fuel shutoff by a quick down elevator movement after the planned number of laps so that the model can approach the mechanic at optimum speed, around 50 km/h. The mechanic will catch the model by the wing, fill the tank from a pressurized can by a <b>hose</b> and finger <b>valve,</b> then restart the engine by hitting the carbon fiber/epoxy resin propeller with his finger. Ground time of a good pitstop is less than three seconds.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{low-pressure}} hose commonly used for suit inflation: The standard Seatec style quick release couple, fitted with an internal Schrader valve, as also used on most buoyancy compensators, and the CEJN connector which allows a higher flow rate due to a larger bore through the non-return valve in the connector. This valve can allow a dangerously fast inflation rate if it jams open, and is also more likely to free-flow when disconnected. These <b>hoses</b> use incompatible <b>valve</b> nipples, but it is usually possible to swap the fitting on the inflator valve to accept the alternative hose. Both types of BCD and dry suit inflator hoses are supplied with an O-ring sealed 3/8โ male UNF thread for connection to a low-pressure first stage port.|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s single-hose {{regulators}} {{started to take}} over as the standard, and this complicated the buddy breathing procedure. The single <b>hose</b> exhaust <b>valve</b> position {{at the bottom of}} most DVs made it necessary to offset the recipient to the right side when face to face, or to the left when side by side. The standard procedure of continuous exhalation during ascent to avoid lung over-pressure injury could leave the diver with insufficient air to clear the regulator, so it was necessary to hold the DV in a way that did not obstruct the recipient from accessing the purge button, as the single hose would not normally free flow when raised above the head. The increasing popularity of the buoyancy compensator was another complication, as it is necessary to periodically vent it during an ascent to avoid a runaway expansion of the contents and an uncontrolled buoyant ascent. This requires the use of one hand. the other is needed to control the regulator and hold on to the other diver, a moderately complex set of simultaneous tasks. It is possible to coordinate these activities, but this requires greater skill than with the original procedure, and therefore more intensive training to perform reliably. Since running out of air was becoming less common, the procedure was practiced less often, and skills generally deteriorated. The use of a secondary (octopus) second stage or a bailout cylinder removes the necessity for this complex and relatively stressful procedure.|$|R

This procedure is only applicable if previously certified vapor recovery equipment (nozzle, <b>hose,</b> P/V <b>valve,</b> etc.) are used with the system. However, if uncertified vapor recovery equipment is used with the system, then such equipment may require prior certification by CP- 201. Small, integral aboveground tank systems shall be tested during the summer months (normally between May and October) when heat transfer rate, solar insolation, and diurnal temperature variation are at a maximum. Vapor recovery systems are complete systems and shall include all necessary piping, nozzles, couplers, processing units, storage tanks and any other equipment necessary for the control of gasoline vapors during fueling operations. This procedure applies to any vapor emissions associated with the dispensing of any fluid, although it is written to reflect application to the hydrocarbon (HC) vapors associated with the dispensing of gasoline at facilities with balance, hybrid, or assist type vapor recovery systems. 1. 2 Modifications Additional modifications may be required for unique installations.
