In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

[...] Because of his {{repeated}} job changes, the Associated Press dubbed Shaugnessy [...] "football's man in motion". At Maryland, he replaced Bear Bryant who had departed for Kentucky.

[...] Years later, Richter explained this decision as follows: [...] "Perhaps the best way I can put <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> see no point in adding to all the bad music in the world".|$|E

2500|$|Boulanger's unrelenting {{schedule}} of teaching, performing, composing, writing letters etc. {{started to take}} its toll on her health; she had frequent migraines and toothaches. She stopped writing as a critic for Le Monde musical as she could not attend the requisite concerts. To maintain the living standard {{for her and her}} mother, she concentrated on teaching. This was her most lucrative source of income. Fauré believed she was mistaken to stop composing, but she told him, [...] "If there is one thing of which I am certain, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wrote useless music." ...|$|E
