5|$|In 1962 Gielgud met Martin Hensler (1932–99), an {{interior}} designer exiled from Hungary. He was temperamental, and Gielgud's friends often found him <b>difficult,</b> <b>but</b> the two became a long-term couple and lived together until Hensler's death. Under his influence Gielgud moved his main residence from central London to Wotton Underwood in Buckinghamshire.|$|E
5|$|The Witness {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} <b>difficult</b> <b>but</b> surmountable puzzles and the game's art and setting.

5|$|Both {{of these}} {{investigations}} began almost immediately. In {{the days following}} the tornado, Tinker's meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C. Miller investigated surface and upper-air weather data from this and past tornado outbreaks, hoping {{to be able to}} identify conditions which were favorable for tornadoes. By March 24, they had compiled several possible tornado indicators, and decided it would be <b>difficult,</b> <b>but</b> possible, to identify large tornado threat areas in the future.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} at Saint Hilda's Primary School, Presbyterian High School and other {{locations}} during the school holidays in June. Neo hired real gangsters to act in several gangster scenes as he was dissatisfied with the extras. According to him, communicating with the gangsters was <b>difficult,</b> <b>but</b> {{when he decided to}} apply the lessons from the movie and praised them for a good take, they reacted well. Several members of the cast also said that I Not Stupid Too inspired them to communicate better with their family members. On 26 January 2006, distributor United International Pictures released I Not Stupid Too on 36 screens in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|For the Coalition, the Russians were secure on {{the north}} bank of the Danube, {{awaiting}} reinforcements from Galicia; the bridges between Linz and Vienna had been destroyed, making French access to the Austrian capital more <b>difficult,</b> <b>but</b> not impossible. After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news, the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory. The French had retreated from the field with a badly mauled division and Kutuzov had secured the right flank. Indeed, Francis was so pleased with the outcome at Dürenstein that he awarded Kutuzov the Military Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Einstein {{proposed}} {{a model of}} matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting {{the frequency of the}} actual oscillations would be <b>difficult,</b> <b>but</b> he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model.|$|E
5|$|In the DVD commentary, Matt Groening {{notes that}} {{beginning}} any television series is <b>difficult,</b> <b>but</b> he found particular difficulty starting one {{that took place}} in the future because of the amount of setup required. As a trade off, they included a lot of Easter eggs in the episode that would pay off in later episodes. He and Cohen point these out throughout the episode. The scene where Fry emerges from a cryonic tube and has his first view of New New York was the first 3D scene worked on by the animation team. It was considered to be a defining point for whether the technique would work or not.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 2012, Hoffman made his final stage appearance, {{starring}} as Willy Loman in a Broadway revival of Death of a Salesman. Directed by Mike Nichols, the production ran for 78 performances and was the highest-grossing show in the Ethel Barrymore Theatre's history. Many critics felt that Hoffman, at 44, was too young {{for the role of}} 62-year-old Loman, and Chris Jones of the Chicago Tribune felt that the character had been interpreted poorly. Hoffman admitted that he found the role <b>difficult,</b> <b>but</b> he nevertheless earned his third Tony Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} both sides claimed victory and modern views {{as to who}} won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no {{strategic}} impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held {{until the end of}} the war. Polish historiography during the People's Republic of Poland portrayed the battle as <b>difficult,</b> <b>but</b> victorious. After the fall of communism, Polish historians became much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming the near destruction of the Polish force on his incompetence and desire to capture Dresden. The battle's outcome is now generally seen in Poland as a very costly victory for the Soviets and their Polish allies.|$|E
5|$|Condor {{was ordered}} as a {{replacement}} for the gunboat , which had been sunk by the hurricane that hit Apia in 1889. She was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in 1891. An outbreak of Cholera in Hamburg made work on the ship <b>difficult,</b> <b>but</b> the completed hull was nevertheless ready for launching as scheduled, on 23 February 1892. Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Wilhelm Schröder, the Chief of the Baltic Station, gave the speech at her launching, and she was christened by Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) von Bodenhausen, the director of the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Dockyard) in Wilhelmshaven. The ship accidentally launched itself due to the tide coming earlier than expected. She was completed on 9 December of that year, when she was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy; precautions against cholera delayed the beginning of sea trials until 15 December.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} Polish casualties—or {{according}} to one historian, possibly because of them—the battle has been largely neglected in Polish historiography. During {{the period of the}} People's Republic of Poland it was portrayed merely as a <b>difficult</b> <b>but</b> victorious battle. However, since the fall of communism modern Polish historians have been much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming his drive on Dresden for the near destruction of the Polish force. Świerczewski's lack of competence, according to some sources, included commanding the battle while drunk. He was briefly relieved of command by Marshal Konev, but due to the backing of the Soviet high command (most likely the NKVD) he not only retained his position but all controversies were hushed up, and after the war was hailed as a hero. The actions of other Polish officers have also been questioned, such as the 9th Infantry Division commander's decision to advance without sufficient reconnaissance and escort.|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, the U.S. Army {{participated in}} Operation Overlord, the Allied {{invasion}} of Normandy. After heavy fighting, the Allies {{broke out of}} Normandy in July 1944. Efforts to capture the ports in Brittany proved <b>difficult,</b> <b>but</b> Allied forces quickly liberated Belgium and much of France. U.S. forces participated in the invasion of southern France (Operation Dragoon) in August 1944, and the airborne assault on the Netherlands (Operation Market Garden) in September, but logistical difficulties and German resistance slowed U.S. assaults on the Siegfried Line and in Lorraine in late 1944. In December 1944, the U.S. Army {{was surprised by the}} German Ardennes offensive (the Battle of the Bulge), which was defeated only after costly fighting that strained the U.S. Army's manpower to its limits. In February 1945, operations began that drove the Germans from the Rhineland, and the Rhine was crossed in March 1945. In April 1945, U.S. Army forces entered the heartland of Germany. Operations continued until the war in Europe ended on 8 May 1945 with the signing of unconditional surrender the previous day.|$|E
5|$|In Parenthesis (1937) by David Jones, {{in which}} he {{reflects}} on the carnage he witnessed in the First World War. Jones put a quotation from the Gododdin {{at the beginning of}} each of the seven sections of In Parenthesis. Another poet writing in English, Richard Caddel, used Y Gododdin as the basis of his <b>difficult</b> <b>but</b> much-admired poem For the Fallen (1997), written in memory of his son Tom. Tony Conran's poem Elegy for the Welsh Dead, in the Falklands Islands, 1982 opens with the line 'Men went to Catraeth', using the original poem to comment on a contemporary conflict. The theme and rhythm of Y Gododdin are also the undercurrent for Owen Sheers’s Pink Mist (2012), an epic elegy to dead and wounded soldiers who served in Afghanistan; the poem, which drew on 30 interviews with returned servicemen, was originally commissioned for radio and then produced by the Old Vic theatre company as a stage play.|$|E

5|$|Koji Sugimoto, main {{programmer}} for characters, {{said that}} {{the complexities of the}} PlayStation 2 hardware made mastering it <b>difficult,</b> <b>but</b> more rewarding because the details on Yuna's sleeves to the depiction of shine and shadow could be rendered more realistically. Final Fantasy X was the first game that allowed for 3-D model rendering of backgrounds that increased the presentation, including small details like grass blowing in the wind and cloud movement. Takayoshi Nakazato decided to abandon the typical world map concept for a more realistic depiction. Final Fantasy Xs spatial presentation of Spira is tied to progression; with a player's progress being marked through the panoramic introduction and depiction of the area upon first entry. Chiharu Minekawa, the supervising sound editor, commented that the transition in sound from one environment to the next was done seamlessly in order to mimic the natural surroundings of these environments as the player moved through them.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of whether the defences would have been effective in invasion is vexed. In mid-1940, the preparations relied heavily upon field fortifications. The First World War made it clear that assaulting prepared defences with infantry was deadly and <b>difficult,</b> <b>but</b> similar preparations in Belgium had been overrun by well-equipped German Panzer divisions in the early weeks of 1940 and with so many armaments left at Dunkirk, British forces were woefully ill-equipped to take on German armour. On the other hand, while British preparations for defence were ad hoc, so were the German invasion plans: a fleet of 2,000 converted barges and other vessels had been hurriedly made available and their fitness was debatable; in any case, the Germans could not land troops with all their heavy equipment. Until the Germans captured a port, both armies would have been short of tanks and heavy guns.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} of these names indicates, the path was {{partially}} wooded, as its southern reaches crossed the transition zone between the western prairies and eastern woodland. From Fort Garry, southbound cart trains followed {{the eastern edge of the}} Red River's Great Plains, crossing the Roseau River and the international border. In Minnesota, the trail was joined by a route coming from Pembina to the northwest, and continued south on a level prairie in the former lakebed of prehistoric Lake Agassiz. It ascended to and followed a firm gravelly ridge which was once among the higher beaches or strandlines of that ancient lake, forded the Red Lake River at the Old Crossing near modern Huot, and angled south by southeast to the fur post at White Earth. At Otter Tail Lake, the route left the plains and turned east into a forest in the Leaf Mountains on the continental divide. Taking a <b>difficult</b> <b>but</b> scenic path east through the woods, the trail crossed the Mississippi River at Old Crow Wing. It then went south down the east bank of that river on a smooth and open glacial outwash sandplain to Sauk Rapids and East Saint Cloud.|$|E
