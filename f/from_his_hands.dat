5|$|Having seen Saigon slip <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on many {{occasions}} in the previous decade, Nguyễn Ánh was keen to strengthen his hold on the key southern city, turning it into his capital, and the base for his preparations for his planned conquest of the Tây Sơn and Vietnam. His enemies had regularly raided the area and confiscated the rice harvest.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to make {{minor changes to the}} film, mostly to the shower scene. In Britain, the BBFC {{requested}} cuts to stabbing sounds and visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> was objected to. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast, and a shot of Norman's mother's corpse were removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Jones is reinstated at Marshall College {{and made}} an associate dean, and he and Marion are married. Before the wedding party leaves the chapel, {{a gust of wind}} blows Indy's brown fedora off the coat rack and deposits it at Mutt's feet. Mutt picks it up and is about to don it before Jones snatches it <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and puts it on with a grin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first player}} goes again, {{and if his}} face-up card {{happens to be a}} two it can be placed in the middle, on top of the one. If the top card cannot be played, the player plays <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> (he is {{required}} to play 1s <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand).</b> If he can't play <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> he may play <b>from</b> <b>his</b> reserve piles (but is not required to). Players must always play from the Flinch Pile first (and must play the card if possible). A player is not required to play <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>Hand</b> or Reserve Pile (except 1s as noted above).|$|R

5|$|Shortly afterwards, a {{delivery}} from Larwood knocked Woodfull's bat <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and the Australian captain seemed unsettled. Two quick wickets fell before Ponsford joined Woodfull in the middle, but having {{been struck by}} short balls several more times, Woodfull was bowled by Allen for 22, having batted {{for an hour and}} a half. When a doctor was publicly requested, to attend an injury to Voce, many in the crowd believed it was Woodfull who required assistance, leading to a renewal of protest. In later years, Woodfull's wife believed that his injury at Adelaide was partly responsible for his death aged 67 in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The Limbourg brothers's ornate Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry perhaps marks {{both the}} {{beginning}} and a highpoint of Netherlandish illumination. Later the Master of the Legend of Saint Lucy explored the same mix of illusionism and realism. The Limbourgs' career ended just as van Eyck's began – by 1416 all the brothers (none of whom had reached 30) and their patron Jean, Duke of Berry were dead, most likely from plague. Van Eyck {{is thought to have}} contributed several of the more acclaimed miniatures of the Turin-Milan Hours as the anonymous artist known as Hand G. A number of illustrations from the period show a strong stylistic resemblance to Gerard David, though it is unclear whether they are <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> or those of followers.|$|E
5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to a {{post in the}} ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E

50|$|During his childhood, he {{was known}} as Eats <b>from</b> <b>His</b> <b>Hand.</b> Later, he {{inherited}} the name Wooden Leg <b>from</b> <b>his</b> uncle, a Crow adopted by the family of Eagle Feather on the Forehead. This young Crow proved to be a tireless walker, outlasting all the young Cheyenne and earning the name Wooden Leg, since his tireless legs seemed to be made of wood. Only his nephew was able to follow him during his endless walks, so the friends of Eats <b>from</b> <b>His</b> <b>Hand</b> began calling him by his uncle's name in sport. Eventually, Eats <b>from</b> <b>His</b> <b>Hand</b> took <b>his</b> uncle's name as his own.|$|R

25|$|Another {{incident}} occurred in 1958 {{in a game}} against the Washington Senators. Williams struck out, and as he stepped from the batter's box swung his bat violently in anger. The bat slipped <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> was launched into the stands and struck a 60-year-old woman— one {{who turned out to be}} the housekeeper of the Red Sox general manager Joe Cronin. While the incident was an accident and Williams apologized to the woman personally, to all appearances it seemed at the time that Williams had hurled the bat in a fit of temper.|$|E

25|$|Except for Brophy, all {{crew members}} of the Lancaster managed to escape the burning bomber. Five left through the front escape hatch {{on the floor of}} the cockpit. When bomb aimer Jack Friday, tried to release the escape hatch cover in the aircraft's nose, the rushing wind ripped it <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> The hatch cover caught him above his left eye and knocked him out. He fell into the open hatch and jammed it closed until Flight {{engineer}} Roy Vigars reached him to quickly clip on Friday's parachute and toss him out the hatch while pulling the unconscious crewman's rip cord. Only Mynarski managed to leave via the rear escape door.|$|E
25|$|Kulottunga {{also lost}} much of his territories in Vengi. The {{northern}} half of the Vengi kingdom if not the whole of {{it seems to have}} slipped <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and gone to the Western Chalukyan empire under Vikramaditya VI. Encouraged by the successes of Hoysala, Vikaramaditya invaded Vengi in 1118 CE. The aging Kulotunga summoned the Viceroy of Vengi Vikrama Chola and installed him as heir apparent to the Chola throne. Lacking any meaningful leadership in Vengi, it soon fell to Vikramaditya and remained in his hands until his death in 1126 CE. However, overall for the Cholas the loss of Vengi was a purely temporary one for they would regain Vengi under Vikrama Chola with him routing the Chalukyas in 1124–25 and Vengi would remain in the Chola-fold till rule of Kulottunga-III (1176–1218).|$|E
25|$|In 1867, Aunt Lily unintentionally burns {{down the}} de Lutrelle's barn. Gervaise decides {{that he has}} to sell the crown to pay for the repairs. In 1997 Daniel and Fergus are arguing because Daniel has his real dad with him and Fergus doesn't. Fergus throws a {{baseball}} at Daniel, he ducks and goes through the mirror, at the same time Constance argues with her father not to sell the crown and grabbed it <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and races through the mirror. As Constance and Daniel are travelling through the mirror, the baseball hits it and it shatters into thousands of pieces. In the past Gervaise saw his daughter travel through the mirror and ducks from the shards of glass as they shoots from the frame. Daniel and Constance are still in Limerick House, but they are in a different dimension.|$|E

25|$|Carey's Squadron Leader {{had ordered}} him to cover the {{squadron}} with just three other pilots. A large number of escorting Bf 109s engaged his three-man section. Carey {{was able to get}} into firing positions several times before a Bf 110 hit him with cannon fire. The round hit the port wing and exploded the ammunition stored there, causing a large hole. The Hurricane turned onto its back and Carey noticed blood seeping <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and arm. He corrected the attitude of the aircraft and succeeded in attacking a flight of Bf 109s from astern and hit one but was again attacked and hit by a Bf 110 which shot off his rudder and one elevator. The fight had taken him near to Cherbourg and he decided to extract himself and fly to Tangmere. The Hurricane, P3202, was later repaired. 43 Squadron's tormentors in the battle were probably from V./LG 1.|$|E
25|$|They {{discover}} it {{on a nearby}} moon and destroy it by tricking the platforms to fire on their own power supply. On the station, Dax is visiting the Bajoran Temple to thank the Prophets for her pregnancy. Dukat, possessed by the Pah-wraith, suddenly transports in. Dax goes for her phaser but he hits her with bolts of energy <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and she collapses. He opens an orb of the prophets and the energy leaves his body, entering the orb which turns black. Outside the station, the Bajoran wormhole implodes. Dukat, back to his old self, apologises to Dax and departs the station. The crew of the Defiant are informed of the attack and rush back to the station. When they arrive, they are informed that the wormhole is gone and all the Bajoran orbs have turned dark. Bashir says {{that he was able}} to save the Dax symbiont but not Jadzia. She survives long enough to say goodbye to Worf. Over Jadzia's coffin, Sisko says that he has to leave the station and announces that he is returning to Earth. He departs with his son, Jake (Cirroc Lofton), leaving Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) in charge of DS9.|$|E
25|$|On March 8, 1847, Narioki {{arrived in}} Satsuma, making Nariakira’s position, {{something}} equivalent to deputy to his father, obsolete. After essentially having {{the reins of}} power wrenched <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> by his own father, Nariakira left Satsuma for Edo. The authority formerly vested him was clearly and quickly being shifted to his half brother, Hisamitsu Hisamitsu was rapidly elevated {{through the ranks of}} his father’s court soon after Nariakira’s departure from Satsuma for Edo. He was placed in charge of the newly created office of military service of Satsuma in October 1847. In 1848, Narioki appointed Hisamitsu steward of Chosa District, with the responsibility of acting on behalf of the daimyō in all military matters in the area. At about the same time, Hisamitsu was given the highly respected post of han councilor, a rank which, according to the instructions accompanying the appointment, placed him {{at the top of the}} social scale. At ceremonial occasions, Hisamitsu was ordered by his father to sit at a place higher than that of the deputy in charge of the daimyō of Satsuma’s castle. Narioki even went so far as to place Hisamitsu in charge of all of Satsuma whenever the daimyō chose to leave Satsuma for any reason, business or pleasure. It was apparent that Hisamitsu was being groomed to become the next daimyō, completely disregarding the fact that, by primogeniture, Nariakira was supposed to be the heir-apparent.|$|E

Another rule enforced is the lane violation in which players from both teams are prohibited to enter the lane until after the free-throw shooter releases the ball <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> A recent innovation is the introduction of the restricted area arc directly underneath the basket where the defending player cannot force an offensive foul on the opposing player.|$|E
