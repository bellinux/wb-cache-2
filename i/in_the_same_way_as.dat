Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that the twisting makes the stems stiffer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> the twisting of a rope; Thompson's {{view is that the}} mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.|$|E

Some squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescent chemical mixtures or bacterial slurries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> many squid use ink. A cloud of luminescent material is expelled, distracting or repelling a potential predator, while the animal escapes to safety. The deep sea squid Octopoteuthis deletron may autotomise portions of its arms which are luminous and continue to twitch and flash, thus distracting a predator while the animal flees.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the problem}} was that Bordeaux may not have {{appeared}} a plausible Allied target because it was out of range of fighter aircraft cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from lack of resources.

Crowdy suggests that with physical deception, and more effort, Ironside could have succeeded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> deceptions aimed against Calais, Normandy and the Mediterranean.|$|E
