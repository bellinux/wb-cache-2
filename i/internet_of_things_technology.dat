50|$|With the {{commercial}} availability of cloud computing, SCADA systems have increasingly adopted <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>technology</b> to significantly reduce infrastructure costs and increase {{ease of maintenance}} and integration. As a result, SCADA systems can now report state in near real-time and use the horizontal scale available in cloud environments to implement more complex control algorithms than are practically feasible to implement on traditional programmable logic controllers. Further, the use of open network protocols such as TLS inherent in the <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>technology,</b> provides a more readily comprehensible and manageable security boundary than the heterogeneous mix of proprietary network protocols typical of many decentralized SCADA implementations. One such example of this technology is an innovative approach to rainwater harvesting through the implementation of real time controls (RTC).|$|E

40|$|Supply-demand {{systems in}} Smart City sectors such as energy, transportation, telecommunication, are subject of {{unprecedented}} technological transformations by the <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things.</b> Usually, supply-demand systems involve actors that produce and consume resources, e. g. energy, {{and they are}} regulated such that supply meets demand, or demand meets available supply. Mismatches {{of supply and demand}} may increase operational costs, can cause catastrophic damage in infrastructure, for instance power blackouts, and may even lead to social unrest and security threats. Long-term, operationally offline and top-down regulatory decision-making by governmental officers, policy makers or system operators {{may turn out to be}} ineffective for matching supply-demand under new dynamics and opportunities that <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> <b>technologies</b> bring to supply-demand systems, for instance, interactive cyber-physical systems and software agents running locally in physical assets to monitor and apply automated control actions in real-time. e. g. power flow redistributions by smart transformers to improve the Smart Grid reliability.
