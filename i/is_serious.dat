5|$|Bees can be {{severely}} and even fatally affected by pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals that man has {{introduced into the}} environment. They can appear inebriated and dizzy, and even die. This <b>is</b> <b>serious</b> because it has substantial economic consequences for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Evidence is {{mounting}} that there <b>is</b> <b>serious</b> {{competition for food}} between larval/early juvenile introduced carp and larval/early juvenile native fish. Introduced carp dominate the fish faunas of lowland Murray-Darling rivers; the sheer amount of biomass carp now take up, and {{the large numbers of}} larvae carp produce, causes serious negative effects on river ecosystems and native fish. Carp are the main vector of the introduced Lernaea parasite (Lernaea cyprincea) and serious vectors of the introduced Asian fish tapeworm (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi).|$|E
5|$|TISM (an acronym of This <b>Is</b> <b>Serious</b> Mum) were a seven-piece {{anonymous}} alternative {{rock band}} from Melbourne, Australia. The group were formed on 30 December 1982 by vocalist/drummer Humphrey B. Flaubert, bassist/vocalist Jock Cheese and keyboardist/vocalist Eugene de la Hot Croix Bun, and enjoyed a large underground/independent following. Their third album, Machiavelli and the Four Seasons, reached the Australian national top 10 in 1995.|$|E

5|$|Vitamins are {{essential}} for the normal growth and development of a multicellular organism. Using the genetic blueprint inherited from its parents, a fetus begins to develop from the nutrients it absorbs. It requires certain vitamins and minerals to be present at certain times. These nutrients facilitate the chemical reactions that produce among other things, skin, bone, and muscle. If there <b>is</b> <b>serious</b> deficiency {{in one or more}} of these nutrients, a child may develop a deficiency disease. Even minor deficiencies may cause permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition <b>is</b> <b>serious,</b> governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E
5|$|Later, Jack asks Liz {{about her}} {{relationship}} with her boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon), an airline pilot. She tells him that during the summer break the two met twice a month in a hotel. Jack does not believe that the relationship <b>is</b> <b>serious</b> since Carol never stays at Liz's apartment. He decides to force Carol to stay with Liz and reserves all the rooms of the hotel that Liz and Carol stay in when he is in New York. During his stay with Liz, Carol bursts into tears and asks her where their relationship is heading as he believes that she is resisting him, which she denies. The next day, Carol decides to leave New York early, but tells Liz that they need to work on their relationship. The two go their separate ways and agree to meet again on October 14.|$|E

50|$|Modern flat Earth {{societies}} {{consist of}} individuals {{who believe that the}} Earth is flat rather than an oblate spheroid. Such groups date {{from the middle of the}} 20th century; some adherents <b>are</b> <b>serious</b> and some <b>are</b> not. Those who <b>are</b> <b>serious</b> may <b>be</b> motivated by pseudoscience or by religious literalism.|$|R
5|$|When Grace (Debra Messing) and {{her boyfriend}} Leo (Harry Connick Jr.) take a walk around Central Park, they notice a tent and a van parked nearby, after a bride and groom ran past them. Eager {{to know what is}} happening, Grace stops by the van, sees Katie Couric, and asks her what is going on. Katie tells Grace that The Today Show is having massive {{televised}} weddings in the park for ratings sweeps week. When Katie asks Grace and Leo if they would like to get married, Leo says yes, but Grace believes he is being sarcastic, only later realizing that he <b>is</b> <b>serious.</b> Leo explains to Grace that because they originally met in a park, they should also get married in a park. Leo proposes and Grace accepts, despite that the two have only known each other for two months.|$|E
5|$|Half-demon Callie Maggotbone's demon father Aldermach is {{pressuring}} her {{to break}} up with her boyfriend Mark Lilly and marry Twayne Boneraper, to fulfill an ancient magical blood pact; Aldermach gets paid by Twayne's family to deliver him a bride, {{and if he does}} not, he will get murdered. Callie refuses to marry Twayne, and to prove that her relationship with Mark <b>is</b> <b>serious,</b> she invites him to move in with her, but does not tell him about her arranged marriage to Twayne. Meanwhile, Mark is having troubles at the Department of Integration; he receives rather negative feedback on his teacher evaluation forms from his students. Since the department cannot afford having individual sessions with students, he decides to hold them at his and his zombie roommate Randall's apartment. At his first session, Mark is kidnapped by Aldermach who bribes him {{to break up}} with Callie. Mark declines, and Callie's human mother Rosie shows up and argues with Aldermach, which gives Mark the idea to invite them both to therapy sessions. Following the session, Mark leaves the room for a short while, and when he comes back, Aldermach and Rosie are having sex and eventually get back together.|$|E

25|$|If the {{myasthenia}} <b>is</b> <b>serious</b> (myasthenic crisis), plasmapheresis {{can be used}} {{to remove}} the putative antibodies from the circulation. Also, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) {{can be used to}} bind the circulating antibodies. Both of these treatments have relatively short-lived benefits, typically measured in weeks, and often are associated with high costs which make them prohibitive; they are generally reserved for when MG requires hospitalization.|$|E
25|$|The Principles inaugurated {{contemporary}} philosophy. Other {{works have}} won and lost the title. Such {{is not the}} case with this one. It <b>is</b> <b>serious,</b> and its wealth perseveres. Furthermore, in relation to it, in a deliberate fashion or not, it locates itself again today in the eyes of all those that believe that contemporary science has modified our representation of the universe and through this representation, our relation to ourselves and to others.|$|E
25|$|Almost any {{medication}} {{involved with}} serotonin regulation {{has the potential}} to cause serotonin toxicity (also known as serotonin syndrome) an excess of serotonin that can induce mania, restlessness, agitation, emotional lability, insomnia and confusion as its primary symptoms. Although the condition <b>is</b> <b>serious,</b> it is not particularly common, generally only appearing at high doses or while on other medications. Assuming proper medical intervention has been taken (within about 24hours) it is rarely fatal.|$|E

U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was forceful in expressing Washington's view on the matter to Israeli officials that even exploratory negotiations with Syria {{are not to be}} attempted. Israel has thus far obeyed Washington's demand to desist.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both {{maintain}} editing Wikipedia with smart phones {{is difficult}} and this discourages new potential contributors. Several years running the number of Wikipedia editors has been falling and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors {{have a vested interest}} in keeping the status quo. Lih alleges there <b>is</b> <b>serious</b> disagreement among existing contributors how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.|$|E
25|$|Watanuki is a {{high school}} student who has the ability of seeing spirits and is {{disturbed}} as a result. One day he stumbles, seemingly by chance, upon the wish-granting shop of Y≈´ko Ichihara. She promises to remove his ability to see spirits if he works part-time in her shop until his work equals the worth of his wish. Since he lives by himself, he is experienced in cooking and cleaning, much to Y≈´ko's pleasure. Besides doing domestic tasks for Y≈´ko, Watanuki also often completes jobs of a spiritual or magical nature. He generally gets enraged at the often insane requests of Y≈´ko, though he pays close attention whenever she <b>is</b> <b>serious</b> with him. Watanuki is known for being both volatile and caring. While around his crush, Himawari Kunogi, he is usually cheerful and excited, whereas around Shizuka D≈çmeki he is much more irritable.|$|E

25|$|We live, they say, in The Information Age, yet {{almost none}} of the {{information}} we think we possess is true. Eskimos do not rub noses. The rickshaw was invented by an American. Joan of Arc was not French. Lenin was not Russian. The world is not solid, it is made of empty space and energy, and neither haggis, whisky, porridge, clan tartans or kilts are Scottish. So we stand, silent, on a peak in Darien a vast, rolling, teeming, untrodden territory before us. QI country. Whatever is interesting we are interested in. Whatever is not interesting, we are even more interested in. Everything is interesting if looked at in the right way. At one extreme, QI <b>is</b> <b>serious,</b> intensely scientific, deeply mystical; at the other it is hilarious, silly and frothy enough to please the most indolent couch-potato.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000), the Weasleys invite Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup. Ron is {{in awe of}} his {{favourite}} Quidditch champion, Viktor Krum. Ron is {{even more}} excited when Krum, still {{a student at the}} Durmstrang wizarding school, comes to Hogwarts {{to take part in the}} Triwizard Tournament, a magical wizarding tournament opposing the top three magic schools in Europe. However, when Harry, underage, mysteriously becomes the fourth Tournament champion, Ron joins the dissenters who think Harry somehow cheated his way into the tournament and feels let down; according to Hermione, this stems from Ron's latent envy caused by being left out of the spotlight shared by Harry or his brothers. The rift <b>is</b> <b>serious</b> enough that the friends fail to make up for nearly a month. They only reconcile shortly after Harry successfully gets by a fire-breathing dragon in the first task; Ron realises how dangerous the Tournament is and finally believes that Harry did not enter himself.|$|E
25|$|Hawkeye later rescues Edwin Jarvis and {{his mother}} from a mugger. In gratitude, Jarvis invites Hawkeye to Avengers Mansion and stages a {{confrontation}} to allow the archer {{to clear his name}} and gain the trust of the Avengers. Hawkeye is then sponsored by his former enemy Iron Man, who sees that he <b>is</b> <b>serious</b> about becoming a hero. Led by Captain America, Hawkeye joins the team along with Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch to form the second incarnation of the Avengers. Almost straight away, Hawkeye clashes with his fellow Avengers. His romantic intentions towards the Scarlet Witch are met with hostility from her brother, Quicksilver. Hawkeye rebels against Captain America‚Äôs leadership (due to his past problems with authority figures), but over time comes to respect him as a mentor and a friend. When the Swordsman attempted to join the Avengers, Hawkeye warned them of his previous history with the villain.|$|E
