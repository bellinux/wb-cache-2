25|$|One {{specific}} research {{topic of}} interest is how microbes such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa invade the eye and cause infection. Although the pathogenesis of microbial keratitis is not well understood, many different factors have been investigated. One group of researchers showed that corneal hypoxia exacerbated Pseudomonas binding to the corneal epithelium, internalization of the microbes, and induction of the inflammatory response. One way to alleviate hypoxia {{is to increase the}} amount of oxygen transmitted to the cornea. Although silicone-hydrogel lenses almost eliminate hypoxia in patients due to their very high levels of oxygen transmissibility, they also seem to provide a more efficient platform for bacterial contamination and corneal infiltration than other conventional <b>hydrogel</b> soft CLs. A recent study showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermis adhere much more strongly to unworn silicone <b>hydrogel</b> CLs than conventional <b>hydrogel</b> lenses and that adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 20 times stronger than that of Staphylococcus epidermidis. This might partly explain why Pseudomonas infections are the most predominant. However, another study conducted with worn and unworn silicone and conventional <b>hydrogel</b> CLs showed that worn silicone CLs were less prone to Staphylococcus epidermidis colonization than conventional <b>hydrogel</b> lenses.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels are {{biocompatible}} and {{proven to}} be tolerated in many tissue types, including the CNS. Mahoney and Anseth formed PEG hydrogels by photopolymerizing methacrylate groups covalently linked to degradable PEG macromers. <b>Hydrogel</b> degradation was monitored over time by measuring mechanical strength (compressive modulus) and average mesh size from swelling ratio data. Initially, the polymer chains were highly cross-linked, but as degradation proceeded, ester bonds were hydrolyzed, allowing the gel to swell; the compressive modulus decreased as the mesh size increased until the <b>hydrogel</b> was completely dissolved. It was demonstrated that neural precursor cells were able to be photoencapsulated and cultured on the PEG gels with minimal cell death. Because the mesh size is initially small, the <b>hydrogel</b> blocks inflammatory and other inhibitory signals from surrounding tissue. As the mesh size increases, the <b>hydrogel</b> is able {{to serve as a}} scaffold for axon regeneration.|$|E
25|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{group of}} researchers led by Prof. Amy Shen, developed a novel cryopreservation method {{that helps to}} protect pancreatic islets from ice damage, and facilitates real-time assessments of cell viability. The novel technique employs a droplet microfluidic device to encapsulate pancreatic islets in <b>hydrogel</b> made of alginate, a natural polymer extracted from seaweed. These capsules have a unique microstructure: a porous network and considerable amount of non-freezable water. Non-freezable bound water does not form ice due to the strong association between water molecules and the <b>hydrogel</b> networks. <b>Hydrogel</b> capsules with large amounts of non-freezable bound water protect the cells from the ice damage and {{reduce the need for}} cryoprotectants—special substances that minimise or prevent freezing damage and can be toxic in high concentrations. The <b>hydrogel</b> capsule allows small molecules, e.g. nutrients and islet secretions, to pass through the membrane easily, but prevents direct contact between implanted cells and host cells and so prevent an attack on transplants by the autoimmune response. The use of a real-time single-islet oxygen sensor – a fluorescent oxygen-sensitive dye in <b>hydrogel</b> capsules allows to use a simple and cheap yet reliable individual-islet-based quality control of viability for the entire islet processing procedure prior to transplantation. Fluorescence indicates whether cells are consuming oxygen and, therefore, are alive and healthy.|$|E
40|$|The {{relatively}} weak mechanical properties of <b>hydrogels</b> remain a major drawback for their application as load-bearing tissue scaffolds. Previously, we developed cell-laden double-network (DN) <b>hydrogels</b> that were composed of photocrosslinkable gellan gum (GG) and gelatin. Further {{research into the}} materials as tissue scaffolds determined that {{the strength of the}} DN <b>hydrogels</b> decreased when they were prepared at cell-compatible conditions, and the encapsulated cells in the DN <b>hydrogels</b> did not function as well as they did in gelatin <b>hydrogels.</b> In this work, we developed microgel-reinforced (MR) <b>hydrogels</b> from the same two polymers, which have better mechanical strength and biological properties in comparison to the DN <b>hydrogels.</b> The MR <b>hydrogels</b> were prepared by incorporating stiff GG microgels into soft and ductile gelatin <b>hydrogels.</b> The MR <b>hydrogels</b> prepared at cell-compatible conditions exhibited higher strength than the DN <b>hydrogels</b> and the gelatin <b>hydrogels,</b> the highest strength being 2. 8 times that of the gelatin <b>hydrogels.</b> MC 3 T 3 -E 1 preosteoblasts encapsulated in MR <b>hydrogels</b> exhibited as high metabolic activity as in gelatin <b>hydrogels,</b> which is significantly higher than that in the DN <b>hydrogels.</b> The measurement of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the amount of mineralization showed that osteogenic behavior of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells was as much facilitated in the MR <b>hydrogels</b> as in the gelatin <b>hydrogels,</b> while it was not as much facilitated in the DN <b>hydrogels.</b> These results suggest that the MR <b>hydrogels</b> could be a better alternative to the DN <b>hydrogels</b> and have great potential as load-bearing tissue scaffolds.

40|$|Oppositely charged homopolyelectrolytes {{were found}} to form strong, tough, and {{self-healing}} polyion-complex (PIC) <b>hydrogels,</b> similar to polyampholytes (PA) which have opposite charges randomly distributed on the same polymer chains. The excellent mechanical performances of these two novel <b>hydrogels</b> are the results of dynamic ionic bonds formation between entangled polymer chains. For the PIC system, only interchain bonding occurs, while for the PA system both inter- and intrachain bonding exist. In addition, the ion pairs are expected to form stronger bonding in the PIC system {{than those in the}} PA system. In this work, we performed a comparative study of PIC <b>hydrogels</b> with the PA <b>hydrogels.</b> The PIC <b>hydrogels</b> are synthesized by sequential homopolymerization of cationic and anionic monomers at varied formulation, and their swelling and mechanical properties are systematically studied in comparison to the PA <b>hydrogels</b> that were synthesized from random copolymerization of anionic monomers and cationic monomers of the similar formulation. Different from the PA system which only forms tough <b>hydrogels</b> around zero net charge composition without chemical cross-linking, the PIC system forms tough physical <b>hydrogels</b> even at weakly offbalanced charge composition. At the charge-balanced composition, the low entanglement concentration of homocharged polyelectrolyte chains leads to tough PIC <b>hydrogels</b> formation at much lower concentrations than that of PA <b>hydrogels.</b> As a result, the PIC <b>hydrogels</b> are much tougher than the PA <b>hydrogels</b> prepared at the same monomer composition.

Here, we designed modular photoclick thiol-ene <b>hydrogels</b> from derivatives of βCD and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), including βCD-allylether (βCD-AE), βCD-thiol (βCD-SH), PEG-thiol (PEGSH), and PEG-norbornene (PEGNB). Two types of CD-PEG hybrid <b>hydrogels</b> were prepared using radical-mediated thiol-ene photoclick reactions. Specifically, thiol-allylether <b>hydrogels</b> were formed by reacting multiarm PEGSH and βCD-AE, and thiol-norbornene <b>hydrogels</b> were formed by cross-linking βCD-SH and multiarm PEGNB. We characterized the properties of these two types of thiol-ene <b>hydrogels,</b> including gelation kinetics, gel fractions, hydrolytic stability, and cytocompatibility.
