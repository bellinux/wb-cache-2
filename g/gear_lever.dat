25|$|The Jolly Club {{pairing of}} Carlo Facetti and Martino Finotto, {{were out of}} luck again, when the ETCC landed in Kent for the Brands Hatch 500km. They lost {{the lead of the}} race they had comfortably headed for 100 of a {{scheduled}} 120 laps, when the <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> broke! Once again the rival Luigi team were on hand to take a well deserved win, this time being driven the Belgian team of Raymond van Hove, Jean Xhenceval and Pierre Dieudonné with the familiar BMW CSL.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Honda only offered one model, {{designated}} as the Hawk, now simply designated CB400T. The CM400E took {{over the role of}} the cheaper Hawk I. It is similar to the European CB400NA. It has the same European styling and six-speed manual gearbox, although the pegs, footrest and <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> are in the same position as the earlier Hawk variants. The bike became electric start only. Smaller 30mm Keihin CV carburettors with accelerator pumps were fitted to comply with US emissions controls. The 1981 model is similar to the European CB400NB and has a dual piston front brake caliper, plastic front fender and a different tank shape.|$|E
25|$|The two Manx Nortons {{arrived on}} the first day of {{practice}} for the 1951 Isle of Man TT Races. Despite trouble with a <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> finished in 9th place for the 1951 Junior TT Race at an average race speed of 81.59mph. After a 20-minute delay, Amm finished in 28th place for the 1951 Senior TT Race at an average race speed of 75.42mph. For the 1952 Isle of Man TT Race, Amm crashed at Braddan Bridge on lap 3 of the Junior Race. This was followed by a 3rd place in the 1952 Senior TT Race at an average race speed of 92.40mph, a race that was won by Reg Armstrong for Norton.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Courage entered three C41-based {{cars in the}} 24 Hours of Le Mans; one C41, {{driven by}} Franck Fréon, Olivier Thévenin and Yojiro Terada, and two C51s, with Cottaz and Goossens partnering Jean-Philippe Belloc in one, and Fredrik Ekblom, Patrice Gay and Tetsuya Tsuchiya driving the other. The C41 {{finished}} in 15th, having completed 304 laps, whilst the Cottaz/Belloc/Goossens C51 retired due to an issue with its <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> after 232 laps, and the other C51 succumbed to a water leak after 126 laps. Equipe Promotion Racing then ran a C41 in the International Sports Racing Series, entering Geoff Farmer and John Burton in the RAC Tourist Trophy; they took tenth overall, and seventh in the SR1 category. At the Coupes d'Automne, Equipe Promotion Racing selected Didier André and Franck Fréon to drive the C41, and they took fourth overall.|$|E

25|$|The 1904 models had 2470cc, four-cylinder, water-cooled, overhead-valve engines {{featuring}} pressure lubrication, {{very unusual}} at the time, {{and were now}} mounted with the epicyclic gearbox between the front seats rather than centrally resulting a design with the driver sitting well forwards and no bonnet. Six-cylinder models joined the line up in 1906. The specification started to become more conventional with wheel steering as an option from 1908, becoming standard {{from the end of}} 1911, and pedals and <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> replacing the original two-lever system of gear changing. George Lanchester was now in charge, Frederick having resigned in 1913, and the engine moved further forward to a conventional position in the sporting, side-valve, 5.5-litre six-cylinder Forty but very few were made before the outbreak of World War I. A distinctive feature of the engine's valves was their use of leaf springs, rather than coil springs. Frank Lanchester ran the London sales office.|$|E
25|$|The GT-R reappeared in 1999, with {{a revised}} chassis and other updates. The R34 turbos {{received}} a ball bearing core. The R34 N1 turbos had a metal exhaust wheel, and ball bearing center section. The turbo outlet pipes were changed from cast to formed metal outlets. The intercooler outlet side and rear turbo dump pipe had temperature probes fitted in the V-spec models. The biggest feature and most significant feature to the R34 GT-R that wasn't seen {{on any other}} model skyline was the display unit {{at the top of}} the dashboard. This display unit was very significant for the car at its time. This display showed many of the cars engine stats including boost pressure, oil temp, water temp and more. As a 1999 car this kind of technology was very rare and advanced at the time. The display was capable of showing the G-force that the car was under when driving and there was also a lap timer that could be started by a button that was located near the <b>gear</b> <b>lever.</b> There was a computer jack lead hidden underneath the left passenger side skirt that could be used to transfer driving data from the car to a laptop. This could only be done with a Japanese version of Windows and Japanese software, which today is very hard to come by.|$|E

Also, the new top of the range level Prestige was introduced, which featured larger door mirrors, body-colored bumpers (entirely), side moldings and door handles, leather-trimmed <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> and steering wheel, as well as other interior refinements. It was only available with a new 1.6-litre 16-valve gasoline engine, which developed [...]|$|E

50|$|The {{approximately}} 3,000 small sugar mills {{that were}} built before 1550 in the New World created an unprecedented demand for cast iron <b>gears,</b> <b>levers,</b> axles and other implements. Specialist trades in mold-making and iron casting developed in Europe {{due to the}} expansion of sugar production. Sugar mill construction developed technological skills needed for a nascent industrial revolution in the early 17th century.|$|R
50|$|A four-speed all-synchromesh manual {{gear box}} came as {{standard}} feature. The gear box was controlled with a column-mounted lever in the lower-priced models, but floor mounting of <b>gear</b> <b>levers</b> was by now {{seen as a}} preferred location, and the more expensive models provided this. The automatic gear box, where specified, was also controlled using a floor-mounted level positioned between the two separate front seats.|$|R
2500|$|A fuel {{efficient}} two-cylinder diesel was prototyped {{in the mid}} 1980s with a G40 supercharger to overcome its small capacity, although this {{did not make it}} to production. A high fuel efficiency model which did make production was the petrol-engined Formel E (E for Economy), introduced at the launch in 1981 with a 1.1 litre engine and from 1983 with a 1.3 litre engine, overdrive top-gear ratio and an early stop-start ignition system (called [...] "SSA") which would cut the engine when idle for more than two seconds to save fuel whilst temporarily stopped in traffic, and restart the engine on moving the <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> to the left in neutral.|$|E
2500|$|Gubby's single {{attempt to}} {{participate}} in a Formula One World Championship race, the 1965 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, also ended with problems in practice. At the Woodcote corner, his Lotus jumped out of sixth gear at 170mph, and Gubby was forced to hold the <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> in position whilst cornering at high speeds. He decided there and then to retire from the sport, and did not attend the following day's practice session. He later recalled, [...] "I was driving on a shoestring, and I thought to myself, 'Brian, you've got a family to look after and you'll end up killing yourself'." [...] He had entered the 1965 Mediterranean Grand Prix, but withdrew his entry and sold his Lotus to Stirling Moss for use by a film company working with Steve McQueen.|$|E

50|$|A bicycle shifter or {{gear control}} or <b>gear</b> <b>levers</b> is a {{component}} {{used to control}} the gearing mechanisms and select the desired gear ratio. Typically, they operate either a derailleur mechanism or an internal hub gear mechanism. In either case, the control is operated by moving a cable that connects the shifter to the gear mechanism. Shifters are mounted on the down tube of the frame, stem, or various locations on the handlebars.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon FE was a {{conservative}} design compared to its competitors.

But I met a gentleman on the train--it was when we were pulling out of Albuquerque, and I was sitting on the back platform of the observation car, and this man was next to me and he asked me for a light, and we got to talking, and come to find out, he came from Aurora, and when he found out I came from Minnesota he asked me if I knew Dr. Clemworth of Red Wing, and of course, while I've never met him, I've heard of Clemworth lots of times, and seems he's this man's brother! Quite a coincidence! Well, we got to talking, and we called the porter--that was a pretty good porter on that car--and we had a couple bottles of ginger ale, and I happened to mention the Kutz Kar, and this man--seems he's driven a lot of different kinds of cars--he's got a Franklin now--and he said that he'd tried the Kutz and liked it first-rate. Well, when we got into a station--I don't remember the name of it--Carrie, what the deuce was the name of that first stop we made the other side of Albuquerque?--well, anyway, I guess we must have stopped there to take on water, and this man and I got out to stretch our legs, and darned if there wasn't a Kutz drawn right up at the depot platform, and he pointed out something I'd never noticed, and I was glad to learn about it: seems that the <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> in the Kutz is an inch longer----" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{two gentlemen}} resumed their seats. The car started {{and then by}} an unfortunate inadvertency Sir Richmond pulled the <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> over from the first speed to the reverse. There was a {{metallic}} clangour beneath the two gentlemen, and the car slowed down and stopped although the engine was still throbbing wildly, and the dainty veil of blue smoke still streamed forward {{from the back of}} the car before a gentle breeze. The doctor got out almost precipitately, followed by a gaunt madman, mouthing vileness, who had only a minute or so before been a decent British citizen. He made some blind lunges at the tremulous but obdurate car, but rather as if he looked for offences and accusations than for displacements to adjust. Quivering and refusing, the little car was extraordinarily like some recalcitrant little old aristocratic lady in the hands of revolutionaries, and this made the behaviour of Sir Richmond seem even more outrageous than it would otherwise have done. He stopped the engine, he went down on his hands and knees in the road to peer up at the gear-box, then without restoring the spark, he tried to wind up the engine again. He spun the little handle with an insane violence, faster and faster for--as it seemed to the doctor--the better part of a minute. Beads of perspiration appeared upon his brow and ran together; he bared his teeth in a snarl; his hat slipped over one eye. He groaned with rage. Then, using the starting handle as a club, he assailed the car. He smote the brazen Mercury from its foothold and sent it and a part of the radiator cap with it flying across the road. He beat at the wings of the bonnet, until they bent in under his blows. Finally, he hurled the starting-handle at the wind-screen and smashed it. The starting-handle rattled over the bonnet and fell to the ground....|$|E
