5|$|During the strike-shortened 1994 season, Hoffman {{took over}} closer duties from an injured and {{ineffective}} Gene Harris in mid-April. Hoffman recorded 20 saves and a 2.57 ERA while averaging 10.9 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9). The weekend after the strike began, Hoffman, playing Nerf football at Del Mar Beach near San Diego, dived for a pass and landed awkwardly on <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder.</b> He later played volleyball {{and landed on}} the shoulder again while going for a dig.

5|$|Jackson {{signed with}} the Cincinnati Reds on April 8, 1995. Again he {{struggled}} with injury, and {{was placed on the}} disabled list once for tendinitis in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> and once for a strained rib cage muscle. In his only year with the club, Jackson posted a team-best 2.39 ERA, while recording 41 strikeouts over 40 games.

Jackson was granted free agency on November 3, 1995.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of his injuries, Ota was unable {{thereafter}} to move <b>his</b> <b>right</b> arm, <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> and fingers properly, causing an end to his professional race career.|$|R
60|$|But Gabriel, by a swift, {{dexterous}} {{movement that}} seemed incompatible {{with his usual}} deliberation, instantly transferred Hamlin to his other arm, and with his burden completely shielded, presented <b>his</b> own <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> squarely to the muzzle of Hall's revolver.|$|R
25|$|With <b>his</b> lower <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> blade shattered, Tutschek {{took six}} months to recover and spent the time writing a memoir of his flying experiences, Stürme und Luftsiege (Attacks and Air Victories). His edited letters would also appear in print at a later date.|$|R
5|$|Necrid's {{alternate}} appearance differs heavily, {{and features}} scaly, reddish–orange skin. Additional differences include teal eyes, black pants, {{and a blue}} jewel. The protruding bones are isolated and bigger on his left shoulder and arm, and appear crystalline. A pauldron covering <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> is fastened to the jewel's support harness, and the armor on his legs incorporate a pair of greaves. He wears a fauld on his abdomen, and bandages wrap around his stomach. A mask covers his face and is {{held in place by}} two straps around his head.|$|E
5|$|Sideways {{curvature}} of his spine was evident as the skeleton was excavated. It has {{been attributed to}} adolescent-onset scoliosis. Although it was probably visible in making <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> higher than the left and reducing his apparent height, it did not preclude an active lifestyle, and would not have caused a hunchback. The bones are those of a male with an age range estimation of 30–34, consistent with Richard, who was 32 when he died.|$|E
5|$|Considered the fourth-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} by Baseball America {{heading into the}} 1995 season, the Yankees projected Jeter as their starting shortstop. He suffered mild inflammation in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> in the Arizona Fall League after {{the conclusion of the}} 1994 regular season. As a precaution, the Yankees signed Tony Fernández to a two-year contract. With Fernández the starting shortstop, the Yankees assigned Jeter to Class AAA. During the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, offered Jeter the opportunity to work out for the MLB team with replacement players in spring training before the 1995 season. Jeter denied receiving the offer, and did not cross the picket line.|$|E

50|$|Zumaya {{sustained}} another injury, {{this time}} to his shoulder, during the 2007 offseason. While helping his father move some boxes in the attic at his father's home in advance of a fire approaching the area, a 50 to 60 lb box fell on <b>his</b> <b>right</b> (pitching) <b>shoulder,</b> separating it.|$|R
50|$|Redman {{served as}} Baltimore's backup in 2003 after {{recovering}} from back surgery. In a November 9, 2003, nationally televised game at St. Louis, Redman replaced injured starter Kyle Boller {{during the game}} and was injured himself, suffering a torn labrum in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> (throwing) <b>shoulder.</b> The season-ending injury was not diagnosed until after the game.|$|R
5|$|On 12 October 1917, Statton was {{involved}} in operations during the First Battle of Passchendaele when he suffered a gunshot wound to <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder.</b> First admitted to the 22nd General Hospital, Douane, Statton was then transferred to the VAD Hospital, Tonbridge, as the wound required treatment in England. Having sufficiently recovered {{after a period of}} hospitalisation at the Fort Pitt Military Hospital, Chatham, and 3rd Auxiliary Hospital, Dartford, Statton was granted two weeks leave from 28 January 1918. Returning to duty, he was attached to the Overseas Training Brigade at Longbridge Deverill prior to re-embarking on 1 May for France, where he rejoined the 40th Battalion twelve days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{represents a}} man, estimated {{by some to}} be 45years of age, standing turned to the viewer's right, looking at the viewer with a commanding expression. In his uplifted right hand he holds a baton with a golden cap. He has a thick moustache and wears a high fur cap on which there is a golden chain with precious stones and a coat of arms in the center. From his ear a large pear-shaped pearl hangs from a golden pendant earring. He wears a reddish-brown mantle with a broad fur collar and, over it, a heavy gold chain from which the order of three horse tails, set in rich pendants, hangs on <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder.</b> A full light from the left falls {{on the right side of}} his face. The background is brownish-grey.|$|E
5|$|Yen {{described}} the {{role as the}} most emotionally and mentally difficult in his career. He spent months preparing for the role by going on a strict diet which consisted of eating one meal a day, training in Wing Chun, and learning more about Ip Man through his two sons. This was all {{in the hopes of}} portraying an erudite and cultured Ip Man, as well as bringing out the special traits of Wing Chun. Yen even went as far as to stay in character after filming, wearing his costume and changing his voice and movement patterns. While rehearsing a fight scene, Yen was reportedly injured when an axe wielder accidentally slashed the side of his left eye. Yen also had a masseur on set as he could not raise <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> due to an injury.|$|E
50|$|August 14, 2014: Ohio State Buckeyes quarterback Braxton Miller is {{featured}} {{on one of}} the five regional college football preview covers. Days later, he re-injured <b>his</b> surgically repaired <b>right</b> <b>shoulder,</b> resulting in him missing Ohio State's entire 2014 season.|$|R
50|$|Gerrans {{underwent}} surgery {{at a hospital}} in Nice following a heavy fall in the GP d'Ouverture la Marseillaise in February, 2006. A pin was inserted into his shattered left collarbone and a screw put into <b>his</b> broken <b>right</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and had stitches in his head. He resumed training three weeks later and went on to represent Australia at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.|$|R
50|$|He {{was buried}} in the fetal position, i.e. with legs tucked towards chest, <b>his</b> <b>right</b> arm {{touching}} <b>shoulder</b> and his left arm bent so that his hand would rest on his stomach. Besides that, they found deposits of animal bones at <b>right</b> <b>shoulder,</b> to <b>his</b> left and to his bottom, and deposits of stone tools around the body. They also did not find any other burials in the cave.|$|R
5|$|After The Legacy disbanded, Orton unsuccessfully {{challenged}} Jack Swagger for the World Heavyweight Championship at Extreme Rules in April. During {{a number}} one contender's {{match for the}} WWE Championship on Raw, Orton was speared by Edge, costing him the match and setting up a bout at Over the Limit, Orton separated <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> during the match, which ended in a double countout. At Fatal 4-Way in June, Orton competed in a fatal four-way WWE Championship match involving champion Cena, Edge, and Sheamus, who won the title after interference from The Nexus. On July 18 at Money in the Bank, Orton competed in a Money in the Bank ladder match for a WWE Championship contract, which was won by The Miz. The following night on Raw, he won a number one contender's match over Edge and Chris Jericho, earning a WWE Championship match against Sheamus at SummerSlam. Sheamus was disqualified for bringing a chair into the ring, giving Orton the win, but not the title. Immediately afterward, Orton hit Sheamus with the chair and an RKO onto the broadcast table.|$|E
5|$|Clark was {{assigned}} {{a position in the}} 1st Infantry Division and flew to Vietnam on May 21, 1969, during the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He worked as a staff officer, collecting data and helping in operations planning, and was awarded the Bronze Star for his work with the staff. Clark was then given command of A Company, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division in January 1970. In February, only one month into his command, he was shot four times by a Viet Cong soldier with an AK-47. The wounded Clark shouted orders to his men, who counterattacked and defeated the Viet Cong force. Clark had injuries to <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder,</b> right hand, right hip, and right leg, and was sent to Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, to recuperate. He was awarded the Silver Star and the Combat Infantryman Badge for his actions during the encounter.|$|E
5|$|Gellibrand was {{disappointed}} at not being appointed AA & QMG, but Bridges was unimpressed with Gellibrand's staff work. He felt that Gellibrand had mishandled the move of the 2nd Infantry Brigade to Cape Helles, where it {{participated in the}} First Battle of Krithia. He also expected Gellibrand to organise a proper officers' mess at Gallipoli and was annoyed at the poor quality of what Gellibrand had scrounged from ships' canteen supplies. Gellibrand might have even been dismissed by Bridges but fate intervened. On 1 May Gellibrand {{was wounded in the}} ankle by shrapnel. Then, on 11 May, while laughing at two men whose water bottles had been holed, he received a severe wound in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> and was evacuated to the hospital ship HMHS Gascon. While it was still anchored off Anzac Cove, Bridges was wounded on 15 May and brought on board the same ship (and to the same bed, Gellibrand was moved out of the way), where Bridges died on 18 May 1915.|$|E
50|$|Haas {{missed the}} rest of the 2014 season to have an {{operation}} on <b>his</b> injured <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> which had forced him to retire from several events. After a later than expected return from injury in the grass court season in June 2015, Haas played his comeback match at Stuttgart as a wild card. In the first round he beat Mikhail Kukushkin in straight sets but then lost to Bernard Tomic in straight sets in the second round.|$|R
50|$|Litsch {{suffered}} a setback with <b>his</b> injured <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> early in 2012 training camp, and {{was shut down}} because of inflammation. He visited surgeon Dr. James Andrews for a full diagnosis that confirmed the inflammation and didn't find any structural damage. Litsch received a platelet-rich plasmas (PRP) injection {{to help with the}} healing process. The injection caused an unexpected serious infection, and Litsch was not allowed to throw for six weeks after undergoing emergency surgery. The infection sidelined him for the entire 2012 season.|$|R
25|$|Bhima {{swung his}} mace and {{shattered}} Dushasana's chariot. Bhima seized Dushasana, ripped <b>his</b> <b>right</b> hand from <b>shoulder</b> and killed him, tearing open {{his chest and}} drinking his blood and carrying some to smear on Draupadi's untied hair, thus fulfilling his vow made when Draupadi was humiliated.|$|R
5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
5|$|In {{his third}} {{season with the}} Blues, Brewer {{continued}} to do well under Andy Murray. Brewer evolved {{into one of the}} top two-way defencemen in the NHL, with comparisons being made between him and former first overall draft pick Chris Phillips of the Ottawa Senators. His play and leadership abilities were recognized, when on February 8, 2008, Brewer was named as the nineteenth captain {{in the history of the}} St. Louis Blues, filling the vacancy created when former Blues captain Dallas Drake had his contract bought out following the 2006–07 season. On February 17, 2008, in a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets, Brewer set a career high for points in a game with four, all assists, eclipsing his previous career high of three points set on January 16, 2007. Brewer finished the season with only one goal in his 77 games played, his lowest goal total since the 1999–2000 season, although he added 21 assists, three short of a career high. At the completion of the season, Brewer underwent reconstructive surgery on <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder</b> to repair damage suffered in a fight in the Blues' season opening game against the Phoenix Coyotes on October 4, 2007.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 2010, NBC Sports {{reported}} {{the confirmation of}} Favre returning to the Minnesota Vikings but saying that the 2010 season would be his final season. An announcement was given on August 17, 2010 confirming {{his return to the}} team. That season, Brett Favre achieved two milestones. He threw for his 500th touchdown and 70,000th yard against the New York Jets. On November 7, 2010, in a game against the Arizona Cardinals, Favre threw for a career-high 446 yards while rallying the Vikings from a 14-point fourth quarter deficit to win in overtime. On December 5, 2010, in a game against the Buffalo Bills, Favre was hit by Bills linebacker Arthur Moats while making a throw, causing him to sustain a sprain of the AC joint in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Favre missed the rest of the game and was replaced by Tarvaris Jackson, who helped lead the Vikings to victory despite throwing three interceptions.|$|E
50|$|Bobby Jarzombek is an American heavy metal/progressive metal drummer of Polish ancestry for who {{has worked}} with Halford, Sebastian Bach and Riot. He has also {{recorded}} and toured with Fates Warning, Arch/Matheos, Iced Earth, Rob Rock, John West, Spastic Ink, and Juggernaut, among others. He is noted for, somewhat uniquely, positioning cymbals behind him, usually over <b>his</b> left and <b>right</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{the same}} day, Bhima swung his mace and {{shattered}} Dushasana's chariot. Bhima seized Dushasana, ripped <b>his</b> <b>right</b> hand from <b>shoulder</b> and killed him, tearing open {{his chest and}} drinking his blood and carrying some to smear on Draupadi's untied hair, thus fulfilling his vow made when Draupadi was humiliated.|$|R
50|$|In 1969, the Bengals {{released}} John Stofa, the Bengals' starting signal caller {{for much}} of the team's inaugural season, and named Cook as the starting quarterback. His season started spectacularly, as he led the Bengals to a 3-0 record. However, in game three versus Kansas City, Cook felt a pop in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> (throwing) <b>shoulder</b> after being tackled by linebacker Jim Lynch and missed the next three games. Possibly due to the limited medical technology at the time, his torn rotator cuff went undiagnosed.|$|R
