40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) behaviour of five alloys in air and in <b>aqueous</b> <b>environments</b> has been performed. The alloys tested include: mild steel as a reference material, a corrosion resistant dual phase steel, 3 CR 12, a proprietary martensitic stainless steel, AISI 431, a newly developed 8 % Cr martensitic steel, Alloy 825, and a newly developed corrosion-abrasion resistant metastable austenitic alloy, 1210. Tests were conducted in laboratory air, distilled water at rest potential, 500 ppm chloride solution at rest potential, 1000 ppm chloride solution at rest potential, and 1000 ppm chloride solution at - 1200 m V see; solution temperatures were maintained at 25 ‚Å∞ C. Crack growth rate tests were performed using sinusoidal loading at a load ratio R = 0. 1, a frequency of 3 Hz <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory air, and a frequency of 1 Hz <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>environments.</b> At <b>the</b> completion of testing, fracture surfaces were studied using a scanning electron microscope. <b>In</b> air, <b>the</b> mild steel and 3 CR 12 display comparable rates of cracking and exhibit a greater resistance to fatigue crack propagation than the martensitic AISI 431 and Alloy 825; Alloy 825 shows the least resistance to fatigue crack propagation. The deformation induced transformation in 1210 gives this alloy the greatest resistance to fatigue crack propagation in air. Fatigue crack growth rates were all enhanced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>environments.</b> <b>The</b> greatest overall rate of environmentally assisted cracking was shown by alloy 825 while the lowest was shown by the mild steel. Although the rate of cracking of 1210 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>environments</b> was {{less than that of}} Alloy 825, 1210 was influenced the most by <b>the</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>environments.</b> An environmentally assisted cracking index shows that the rate of fatigue crack propagation in 1210 is increased by 32 times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 500 ppm chloride solution at low stress intensities. The fatigue crack growth rates of mild steel and AISI 431 were significantly influenced by the cathodically polarised conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1000 ppm chloride solution, compared to the rest potential conditions. In these cases hydrogen was seen to be evolved from the specimen surfaces. Changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fatigue crack growth rate behaviour were accompanied by changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fracture surface morphologies. The observed changes varied for each alloy and for each environment, and were manifest by the degree of intergranular cracking, cleavage, quasi cleavage, and increased coarseness of the transgranular cracking. The fracture surface morphologies are reported and discussed in detail. <b>In</b> general, <b>the</b> fracture surface morphologies could be directly related to the relative degrees of environmental influence on the rate of cracking; results are explained in terms of existing hypotheses. It is suggested that the environmentally assisted cracking of mild steel and AISI 431 at cathodic potentials <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1000 ppm chloride solution could only be attributed to hydrogen assisted cracking. Similarly, it is suggested that the large crack growth rate acceleration of 1210 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>environments</b> could also be attributed to hydrogen. The similar fracture surface morphologies observed on the other specimens after tests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>environments</b> suggests-that hydrogen could be responsible for the environmentally assisted cracking of all <b>the</b> steels <b>in</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R

50|$|The TIM22 {{complex is}} {{responsible}} for mediating the integration of carrier preproteins into the inner membrane. Tim22, a subunit of the TIM22 complex, forms a channel within the inner membrane and {{is referred to as}} the carrier translocase. Tim54 and the small Tim proteins, Tim9, Tim10 and Tim12 also contribute to the TIM22 complex as well as Tim18. The function of Tim18 is not yet clear; however it is believed to play a role in assembly and stabilisation of the TIM22 complex, although is not involved in protein insertion into the membrane. Tim54, although it does not associate directly with Tim22, is also believed to assist in the stability of Tim22. Unlike cleavable preproteins, following translocation across the outer membrane via the translocase of the outer membrane, carrier preproteins are bound by the soluble Tim9-Tim10 complex of which the majority of this complex (~95%) is free floating within the intermembrane space. It is possible that this small Tim complex is able to stabilise precursor carrier proteins by acting as a chaperone and preventing the hydrophobic precursors from aggregating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>environment</b> of the intermembrane space. A small portion of Tim9 and Tim10 (~5%) assembles into a modified complex containing Tim12, on the outer surface of the TIM22 complex. Tim12 is membrane bound and thus may act as a linker molecule docking Tim9 and Tim10 to the face of the TIM22 complex. The carrier preprotein is then inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane in a potential-dependent fashion. The membrane potential is necessary for both insertion of the precursor into the carrier translocase and lateral release of the protein into the lipid phase of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which completes protein translocation. However this membrane potential-dependent process takes place in absence of ATP-driven machinery.|$|E
