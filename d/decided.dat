5|$|De Gaulle <b>decided</b> that France, though {{formally}} remaining a member, {{would no}} longer participate in the NATO military organization. This caused a rift between France and West Germany, which then started to emphasize standardization with American equipment, especially in armament, and to follow the new NATO policy to use multifuel diesel engines. German defence minister Franz Josef Strauss began to oppose the common tank project. In July 1963, the defence committee of the German Bundesrat <b>decided</b> to procure a purely national tank. In response, the same month the French government <b>decided</b> likewise.|$|E

Following the energy crisis in the 1970s, the political climate changed, and in 1977 the city council <b>decided</b> to not close the tramway anyway.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{who should}} <b>decide</b> the corporation tax rate under {{the situation in}} which a local public good has a spillover effect and the central government cannot realize residents’ actual preference of the public good. This paper makes the following conclusions. When a local government <b>decides</b> the tax rate, it has an incentive to not only <b>decide</b> an inadequate tax rate because of the incentive to free-ride but also an incentive to <b>decide</b> an excessive tax rate because of the tax export effect. As such, because the incentive to <b>decide</b> an excessive tax rate is dominant, the local government <b>decides</b> a tax rate higher than the socially optimal one. With regard to the problem of who should <b>decide</b> the tax rate, this paper demonstrates the following: when the spillover effect is large (small), the local (central) government should <b>decide</b> the corporation tax rate. This result is unlike those in previous studies...|$|R

It is therefore important to be able to <b>decide</b> which statements about causality are correct in different models of space-time. In this paper, we analyze the computational complexity of the corresponding <b>deciding</b> problems. In particular, we show that: • for Minkowski space-time, the <b>deciding</b> problem is as difficult as the Tarski’s problem of <b>deciding</b> elementary geometry, while • for a natural model of primordial space-time, the corresponding <b>deciding</b> problem is of the lowest possible complexity. ...|$|R
