Methods A prospective case control study compared 55 patients; symptomatic cholelithiasis - 30 (14 male, median age 36 years; mean BMI - 25. 1 kg/m 2), gallstone pancreatitis - 9 (3 male, median age 35 years; mean BMI - 24. 86 kg/m 2) and IP - 16 (9 male, median age 34 years; mean BMI - 23. 34 kg/m 2) with 30 controls (15 male, median age 38 years; mean BMI = 24. 5 kg/m 2) undergoing laparotomy for conditions {{not related to the}} gall bladder and bile duct. Ultrafiltered bile from the common hepatic duct in patients and controls was incubated in anaerobic conditions and examined by polarized light microscopy to assess bile nucleation time (NT). In the analysis, the <b>mean</b> <b>NT</b> of patients with gallstones and gallstone pancreatitis was taken as a cumulative <b>mean</b> <b>NT</b> for those with established gallstone disease (EGD).

While pre-fixing <b>n(t)</b> <b>means</b> losing the Hamiltonian constraint, pre-fixing a(t) is serendipitously harmless at this level. This suggests {{an alternative to}} the Hartle-Hawking approach, where the pre-fixed a(t) and its derivatives are treated as explicit functions of time, leaving n(t) and a now mandatory ϕ(t) to serve as canonical variables. The naive gauge pre-fix a(t) =const is clearly forbidden, causing evolution to freeze altogether, so pre-fixing the scale factor, say a(t) =t, necessarily introduces explicit time dependence into the Lagrangian. Invoking Dirac's prescription for dealing with constraints, we construct the corresponding mini superspace time dependent total Hamiltonian, and calculate the Dirac brackets, characterized by {n,ϕ}_D≠ 0, which are promoted to commutation relations in the quantum theory.

Despite higher absolute force levels of the ST group, SD and Error were the same in both groups for a given MVC percentage. Signal to noise ratio values showed inverted U-shapes for both groups, with no significant differences between groups on various force levels. The power spectral density analysis disclosed significant differences between groups, with more power in the lowest frequency band (1 - 6 Hz) for the ST group.

Neurite outgrowth from explants of 8 -d chick embryo dorsal root ganglia was achieved at very low NGF concentrations with heart conditioned medium during overnight culture. Quickly incrasing the NGF concentration in the growth medium dramatically affected GC and neurite morphology: the majority of GCs and neurites collapsed and retracted towards the cell body over a course of approximately 2 - 5 min. Retraction was elicited by increasing NGF levels from 0 to 0. 05 ng/ml to as little as 0. 5 ng/ml but did not occur if the NGF concentration during the initial overnight culture period exceeded 0. 8 ng/ml, regardless of how much the concentration was elevated.

Renal oxygenation was measured using blood oxygen level–dependent magnetic resonance. Tissue oxygenation was determined by the measurement of R 2 * maps on 4 coronal slices covering both kidneys.

Ten male <b>NT</b> (<b>mean</b> age: 26. 57. 4 years) and 8 matched HT subjects (mean age: 28. 85. 7 years) were studied. Cortical R 2 * was not different under the 2 conditions of salt intake.

These data demonstrate that dietary sodium intake influences renal tissue oxygenation, low sodium intake leading to an increased renal medullary oxygenation both in normotensive and young hypertensive subjects.

Development of the model is based on a consideration of the slope s=ln(Nt/Nt 1) /ln(Dt/Dt 1) of a log-transformed plot of stocking <b>Nt</b> and <b>mean</b> stem diameter Dt at time t. This avoids the need for subjective decisions about limiting density and allows the use of abundant data further from the self-thinning frontier. The model can be solved analytically and yields equations for the stocking and the stand basal area as an explicit function of stem diameter. It predicts that self-thinning may be regulated by the maximum basal area with a slope of - 2. The significance of other predictor variables offers an effective test of competing self-thinning theories such Yoda's - 3 / 2 power rule and Reineke's stand density index.

40|$|Waste {{water from}} Mexico's largest food {{processing}} industrial sector (based on maize, nejayote water) {{was used for}} growing Brachionus calyciflorus isolated from Lake Chapultepec in the Federal District of Mexico (D. F.). Nejayote water was collected from Colonia Providencia, D. F. Experiments were conducted at 25 °C in 25 ml capacity vials with 20 ml of medium into which we introduced B. calyciflorus at an initial density of 1 ind ml- 1. The experimental design consisted a total of 33 test vessels (2 food combinations X 5 densities X 3 replicates = 30 plus 3 replicates as controls that contained only algae). Experiments were terminated after day 16. Waste water in original concentration <b>did</b> <b>nt</b> rotifes. However, when diluted to 5 oncentrations (ranging from 2 % to 32 % and pH adjusted to 7. 0), rotifer density increased with increasing concentration of waste water. Green algae (at constant density of 2 X 10 6 cells- 1 of Chlorella) in combination with waste water resulted in a higher abundance of rotifers only at higher concentration (above 8 %) of waste water. The maximum peak density of rotifers (238 - 50 ind ml - 1) was obtained at 16 % dilution of waste water nd with addition of Chlorella. The rate of population increase per day ® (mean-SD) varied from 0. 355 - 0. 059 to 0. 457 - 0. 048 depending on food combination and concetration. Se usó aguas de desecho de la industria de la masa y la tortilla (aguas de nixtamal o nejayote) para crecer rotíferos de agua dulce, Brachionus calyciflorus. El nejayote sin dilución no permitió el desarrollo del rotífero. Sin embargo, cuando se diluyó, B. calyciflorus aprovechó la materia orgánica. El agua de desecho por sí misma (sin alimento algal adicional) fue comparable al agua con densidades del alga Chlorella de 2 X 10 (6) células ml- 1. Concentraciones de nejayote por encima del 8 % no permitieron el crecimiento poblacional. Sin embargo, la presencia de alga permitió el desarrollo del rotífero a concentraciones de 8 % y 16 %. Nuestros hallazgos indican que el nejayote puedo ser utilizado de manera efectiva para la producción de rotíferos a gran escala para la acuacultura...|$|R
