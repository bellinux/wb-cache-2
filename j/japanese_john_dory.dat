The first {{printing}} of the tune and text is 1609 in Thomas Ravenscroft's Deuteromelia songbook but we have earlier mentions of the song in books. It was quite popular and both parodies and satires were written to the same melody.|$|R
60|$|Mr. <b>John</b> <b>Dory,</b> who {{had arrived}} at Clenarvon Court in a four-wheel cab from the nearest railway station, was ushered by the butler {{to the door of}} one of the rooms on the ground floor, {{overlooking}} the Park. A policeman was there on guard--a policeman by his attitude and salute, although he was in plain clothes. <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> nodded, and turned to the butler.|$|R
60|$|<b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> glanced {{it through}} {{and rose to}} his feet. A gleam of {{satisfaction}} lit his eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> started back. He looked with {{something}} like apprehension at the youth to whom Marnstam pointed.|$|R
60|$|Three men {{entered the}} room. Two {{remained}} in the background. <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> came forward towards the table.|$|R
60|$|Antoine {{undid the}} cabinet and opened a box of Havanas. <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> {{selected}} one and called for another liqueur.|$|R
50|$|The <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> catches prey by {{stalking}} it, then extending its {{jaw forward}} in a tube-like structure to suck the fish in with some water. The water then flows out through the gills; the pre-maxillary bone, the only tooth-bearing bone in this fish, is used to grind the food. The <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> is primarily a piscivore; it eats a variety of fish, especially schooling fish such as sardines. Occasionally it eats squid and cuttlefish.|$|R

60|$|<b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> {{was nearly}} {{a quarter of an hour}} late. After his third useless summons, Mr. Peter Ruff {{presented}} himself again.|$|R
60|$|Lord Sotherst {{took these}} things in charge, and <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> turned to the man whom they had found {{standing}} over him.|$|R
6000|$|Peter Ruff {{laid the}} paper down upon {{his desk and}} looked {{steadily}} at a box of India-rubber bands. Almost his fingers, as he parted with the newspaper, had seemed to be shaking. His eyes were certainly set in an unusually retrospective stare. Who was this who sought to probe his past, to renew an acquaintance with a dead personality? [...] "M" [...] could be but one person! What did she want of him? Was it possible that, after all, a little flame of sentiment had been kept alight in her bosom, too--that in the quiet moments her thoughts had turned towards him as his had so often done to her? Then a sudden idea--an ugly thought--drove the tenderness from his face. She was no longer Maud Barnes--she was Mrs. <b>John</b> <b>Dory,</b> and <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> was his enemy! Could there be treachery lurking beneath those simple lines? Things had not gone well with <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> lately. Somehow or other, his cases seemed to have crumpled into dust. He was no longer held in the same esteem at headquarters. Yet could even <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> stoop to such means as these? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can feel}} how you like," [...] <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> {{answered}} bluntly, [...] "so long as I get the handcuffs on Spencer Fitzgerald's wrists!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Inspector <b>John</b> <b>Dory,</b> at your lordship's service," [...] saluting. [...] "I {{have been}} sent down from town to help in this little business." ...|$|R
50|$|The harbour {{is popular}} for fishing, {{particularly}} with holiday makers in Matarangi and Whangapoua. Commonly caught fish include kahawai, snapper, <b>John</b> <b>Dory,</b> and barracuda.|$|R
60|$|But, alas! no such fortune was {{in store}} for Mr. <b>John</b> <b>Dory.</b> At daybreak he {{returned}} in a borrowed trap from a neighboring railway station.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, {{to start}} with," [...] <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> said. [...] "It {{seems to me}} not {{impossible}} that we may find another pseudonym for you." ...|$|R
60|$|The two men seated themselves. <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> {{pulled at}} his cigar appreciatively, sniffed its flavor for a moment, and then {{leaned forward in}} his chair.|$|R
5|$|The {{appearance}} of the <b>John</b> <b>Dories</b> is improved by taking off the heads, and cutting away not only the fins but the filaments of the back.|$|R
60|$|<b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> went out, {{followed}} by his men. Sir Richard took Peter Ruff by the arm, and, leading {{him to the}} sideboard, mixed him a drink.|$|R
