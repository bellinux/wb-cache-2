50|$|Solip:System begins {{shortly before}} the ending of <b>Hardwired</b> and {{continues}} beyond that point. In Solip:System, the main character is the computer personality Reno (a minor character in <b>Hardwired).</b> The author intended that this book would provide a link between <b>Hardwired</b> and Voice of the Whirlwind.|$|R
50|$|The unnamed {{man that}} would become <b>Hardwire</b> {{received}} his powers from Rex Mundi and became a hitman for the crime lord, The Operator. Asked by Mundi to kill Hardcase, the Operator offered <b>Hardwire</b> the job. He seriously wounds Hardcase with a surprise attack, but is unable to kill him due to the ultraheroine Choice's intervention. Later that night, a recovered Hardcase defeats <b>Hardwire</b> by dislocating his shoulders. <b>Hardwire</b> is {{turned over to the}} police.|$|R
50|$|Unhappy {{about his}} {{unfinished}} business with Hardcase, <b>Hardwire</b> seeks him out. Hardcase once again defeats him. At {{that moment the}} creature NM-E attacked. <b>Hardwire</b> is rendered unconscious by the killing machine, and found by a man calling himself the Genius. The Genius helps <b>Hardwire</b> recover and augments his abilities, {{to the point where}} he would be more than a match for Hardcase.|$|R

50|$|Collins {{has also}} argued that violent {{confrontation}} goes against human physiological <b>hardwiring.</b> It is the exception, not the rule—regardless of the underlying conditions or motivations. This is in opposition to explanations by social scientists that violence is easy under certain conditions, like poverty, racial or ideological hatreds, or family pathologies.|$|E

50|$|Severely {{overloaded}} Zener diodes {{in reverse}} bias shorting. A sufficiently high voltage causes avalanche {{breakdown of the}} Zener junction; that and a large current being passed through the diode causes extreme localised heating, melting the junction and metallisation and forming a silicon-aluminium alloy that shorts the terminals. This is sometimes intentionally used {{as a method of}} <b>hardwiring</b> connections via fuses.|$|E

50|$|From a young age, Nelson was {{tinkering}} with electronics, aided and abetted by his physicist/engineer father. When {{he enrolled in}} MIT, Nelson became known for hooking up the AI Lab's PDP-1 (and later the PDP-6) to the telephone network, making {{him one of the}} first phreakers; he later accomplished other feats like <b>hardwiring</b> additional instructions into the PDP-1. Nelson was hired by Ed Fredkin's Information International Inc. to work on PDP-7 programs.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose that}} {{networks}} on chip (NOC) are <b>hardwired</b> in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). Although some {{area of the}} FPGA then has a fixed function, this loss of flexibility is outweighed by the following benefits. First, implementation cost is much reduced. Second, a <b>hardwired</b> NOC solves physical problems such as timing closure and high cost of global wiring. Third, dynamic partial reconfiguration can be better exploited. Compared to current soft or firm interconnects, a <b>hardwired</b> NOC poses fewer restrictions on the (re) placement of IP blocks in the FPGA. Finally, we also propose that the <b>hardwired</b> NOC is used for both the functional interconnect between the IP blocks and the configuration interconnect that transports the bitstreams. We give a detailed overview of our NOC architecture, and its configuration and programming. The proposed scheme enhances the on-line generation of bitstreams and the on-line verification of loaded bitstreams to detect tampering with the device. In our experiment, a <b>hardwired</b> NOC has acceptable (≤ 10 %) overhead for IP sizes with approximately 1400 lookup tables (LUT), enabling a fine-grained combined functional and configuration interconnect. A <b>hardwired</b> NOC offers significantly better functional performance than a soft NOC. Moreover, the configuration and programming of the hard NoC is much faster than when using a soft NOC. 1...|$|R

50|$|Unlike human brains {{that rely}} on experience-dependent {{neuronal}} plasticity, the brain of the fly is hardwired for particular tasks in the visual sensory system. The H1 neuron and related tangential neurons are suggested to be genetically determined, meaning that these neurons are unaffected by visual stimuli during early development. Parts of the fly brain have neuroplasticity but the H1 and other tangential neurons are hardwired neuronal machinery. Genetic <b>hardwiring</b> is likely an adaptation strategy that allow the flies to navigate in flight soon after hatching, actions largely mediated by the H1 and related tangential neurons.|$|E

He too manages to get into the editor's office and finds that Vann Harl has been expecting Ford. The episode ends here on a cliff-hanger.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "hard-coded" [...] was {{initially}} {{used as an}} analogy to <b>hardwiring</b> circuits - and was meant to convey the inflexibility which results from its usage within software design and implementation.In the context of run-time extensible collaborative development environments such as MUDs, hardcoding also refers to developing the core engine of the system responsible for low-level tasks and executing scripts, as opposed to softcoding which is developing the high-level scripts that get interpreted by the system at runtime. In this case, the term is not pejorative and refers to general development, rather than specifically embedding output data.|$|E

50|$|Judith Butler {{consolidated}} a new gender theory {{focusing on}} “performativity”. In recent times new gender roles like “performativity” are more widely accepted and enable society to more likely accept phenomena such as crossdressing or transgender bodies. Society {{is the main}} proprietor of gender {{and how it is}} perceived by the people, and this perception differs across the globe. John Money coined the term gender in 1955 and said that gender is based on the social enactment of sex roles, which is exactly what Lucy Brewer explored in her disguise as a marine to live, fight and act as a man. Brewer knew {{what it meant to be}} a woman and what opportunities were given to men stepping outside of her comfort zone with tremendous success. She took great risks in assuming a male role in society to fully explore the other side of the gender role. Brewer was mindful of the male ego and physical thirsts quenched by the allure of women desirous of men in uniform. The strength of the characteristics which define masculinity are due to bodily performance, but Lucy Brewer excelled as a marine in flexing her muscle as she fired a musket just well as any soldier could take aim and fire. Her character challenged the role of masculinity in her time period proving that women can assume the male gender role with relative ease and that it is indeed possible to explore gender outside of what is marked “socially acceptable” and still be respected in society. Lucy’s crossdressing would be perceived by society no differently today than in the past. Regardless of how judgmental mankind is through the <b>hardwiring</b> of male and female mindset across America, a sense of humanity and empathy reigns in us whether born male or female. When Lucy’s pamphlets circulated, people were not overly shocked or appalled by her actions, but rather intrigued that woman was able to conquer the male role. Society’s overall reaction was a reflection on how it evolved and had become more apt to accept transgender actions as well as cross-dressing.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{synaptic}} plasticity in associative learning has been explored extensively computationally. Yet, the computational mechanism for <b>hardwiring</b> of the neural circuit {{has only been}} addressed recently using a systems approach of whole-animal behavior based on an evolutionary process for survival [1, 2]. In this paper, we will explore the computational criteria needed to establish the <b>hardwiring</b> of reflex. The traditional focus of {{synaptic plasticity}} is often placed on addressing {{the conditions in which}} the learning process occurs so as to alter the synaptic strength rather than the conditions in which the learning process should stop. This paper addresses the question of the conditions under which learning should stop and <b>hardwiring</b> begins. Rather than allowing the system to “over-learn ” indefinitely, it is often desirabl...|$|E
