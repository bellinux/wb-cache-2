50|$|Little {{is known}} about {{foraging}} behavior. However, this species has been observed to consume beetles and dragonflies that have fallen into the river. Upon examination of both female and male stomach matter, Lahanas found a distinction of food material percentages. Males had roughly 58% animal matter and 40% plant matter, while females had 70% animal matter and 29% plant matter. The three primary sources of animal matter came from freshwater sponges, bryozoans, and mollusks. The only plant matter found was a <b>freshwater</b> <b>alga.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Chlorosulfolipids are a {{class of}} {{naturally}} occurring molecules that are characterized as being stereochemically complex.

Furthermore, some of these complex molecules that have been isolated from toxic mussels are associated with diarrhetic shellfish poisoning.

40|$|The kerogens {{of three}} Tertiary Catalan {{lacustrine}} oil shales {{were analyzed by}} light microscopy, flash pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and bulk composition methods (elemental analysis, Rock Eval pyrolysis). Two of the three kerogens (Ribesalbes and Campins) are extremely rich in organic sulphur (atomic Sorg/C ratio > 0. 04) and hydrogen (atomic ratio H/C ratio > 1. 5) and are, consequently, classified as Type I-S kerogens. Very characteristic distribution patterns of flash pyrolysis products (e. g., alkan- 9 - and - 10 -ones, alkadienes) of the Ribesalbes kerogen revealed that it is predominantly composed of fossilized organic matter of the <b>freshwater</b> <b>alga</b> Botryococcus braunii. These two findings demonstrate that sulphurization of organic matter may also occur in lacustrine sediments provided that sulphate is supplied by external sources. Data on the third kerogen sample (Cerdanya) suggest that the <b>freshwater</b> <b>alga</b> Pediastrum may contain a (partly) aromatic biomacromolecule that is selectively preserved upon diagenesis. These findings testify to the large variability in palaeodepositional conditions in lacustrine environments. A comparison of the biomarker composition of the extract of the Ribesalbes oil shale with the kerogen composition indicate that biomarkers often cannot be {{used to assess the}} major sources of organic matter in such settings. A similar conclusion can be drawn from a comparison of literature data concerning the Messel Oil Shale...|$|E

The epiphyte assemblage on unenriched C. glomerata was dominated by Epithemia sorex and Epithemia adnata, whereas the assemblage on enriched C. glomerata was dominated by Achnanthidium minutissimum, Nitzschia palea and Synedra spp. These results indicate that nutrients strongly structure epiphyte species composition.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Freshwater</b> <b>algae</b> {{can be used}} as {{indicators}} to monitor <b>freshwater</b> ecosystem condition. <b>Algae</b> react quickly and predictably to a broad range of pollutants. Thus they provide early signals of worsening environment. This study was carried out to develop a computer-based image processing technique to automatically detect, recognize, and identify algae genera from the divisions Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria in Putrajaya Lake. Literature shows that most automated analyses and identification of algae images were limited to only one type of algae. Automated identification system for tropical <b>freshwater</b> <b>algae</b> is even non-existent and this study is partly to fill this gap. Results The development of the automated <b>freshwater</b> <b>algae</b> detection system involved image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification by using Artificial neural networks (ANN). Image preprocessing was used to improve contrast and remove noise. Image segmentation using canny edge detection algorithm was then carried out on binary image to detect the algae and its boundaries. Feature extraction process was applied to extract specific feature parameters from algae image to obtain some shape and texture features of selected algae such as shape, area, perimeter, minor and major axes, and finally Fourier spectrum with principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to extract some of algae feature texture. Artificial neural network (ANN) is used to classify algae images based on the extracted features. Feed-forward multilayer perceptron network was initialized with back propagation error algorithm, and trained with extracted database features of algae image samples. System's accuracy rate was obtained by comparing the results between the manual and automated classifying methods. The developed system was able to identify 93 images of selected <b>freshwater</b> <b>algae</b> genera from a total of 100 tested images which yielded accuracy rate of 93 %. Conclusions This study demonstrated application of automated algae recognition of five genera of <b>freshwater</b> <b>algae.</b> The result indicated that MLP is sufficient, and can be used for classification of <b>freshwater</b> <b>algae.</b> However for future studies, application of support vector machine (SVM) and radial basis function (RBF) should be considered for better classifying as the number of algae species studied increases. </p...|$|R
