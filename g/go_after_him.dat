5|$|At the Powhatan River, Smith, Rolfe, Percy, Walter, Larry, Robin, and Alice {{disembark}} from a barge as {{the chorus}} of soldiers and adventurers sing about the joy of reaching the shore. Larry, Walter, Alice (Walter’s wife), and Robin reminisce about love, and Robin admits to Larry his lustful feelings about Alice. Meanwhile, Nima is preparing a bridal gown for Pocahontas in the royal village of Werocomoco, but Pocahontas expresses displeasure about the arrangement her father made for her to marry Miami, a rival Indian prince. Smith is then attacked by a party of Indians, including Nantaquas, Pocahontas’s brother. Due to his fighting prowess, Nantaquas thinks he is a god, but Smith explains he is only a trained warrior from across the sea. The Indians capture Smith {{to bring him to}} their chief. Back at the Powhatan River, Robin attempts to seduce Alice, but is foiled by Walter and Larry. When Walter tells the group about Smith’s capture, they depart to <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him.</b> Before they leave, Rolfe tries to convince Percy to move on after his lover, Geraldine, apparently was unfaithful.|$|E
5|$|The Apostles of the Stars launch {{their first}} {{attack on the}} World Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos to declare war on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on Creed {{in order to gain}} his help, though he resists, {{planning}} to <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him</b> on his own terms. Chronos assassin Jenos Hazard is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on the Apostles, however, this is really in order to use her as bait to lure Creed out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed's lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. Creed then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert Dr. Tearju, who is also Eve's creator. While there, the Apostles of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant Creed eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, Eathes was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide {{to put a stop to}} Creed.|$|E
25|$|In 1879, Day and his troop were {{transferred}} west to New Mexico where {{they joined the}} rest of the regiment. After the Apache chief Victorio launched two successful raids on 9th Cavalry outposts near the Warm Springs Reservation after he left the San Carlos Reservation on August 21, {{the rest of the}} regiment was mobilized to <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> marking the beginning of the Victorio Campaign.|$|E

25|$|Caroline {{discovers that}} Susan {{is alive and}} well despite being presumed dead and she is in hiding from Wayne. When an upset Wayne gets drunk and then jumps in his car and drives off, Glen and Ginny <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him</b> and a {{high-speed}} chase follows which leads to both Glen's and Ginny's tragic deaths. Wayne manages to turn everyone against him and when he is shot there are no shortage of suspects but it is innocent Beryl who finds herself behind bars for the shooting. While in prison Beryl meets Pamela, a lady who is the spitting image of Patricia. It is soon discovered that Pamela and Patricia are twins, separated at birth. While Patricia lived the good life, Pamela had a much tougher upbringing.|$|E
500|$|The brawl, {{along with}} an {{incident}} between the Vancouver Canucks' Todd Bertuzzi and Steve Moore of the Colorado Avalanche, (in which Bertuzzi hit Moore from behind, breaking his neck, in retaliation for a hit by Moore on one of Bertuzzi's team-mates a month earlier), brought the issue of violence in ice hockey into focus. Particular attention was given to retaliation; when Brashear was interviewed {{on the subject of}} the Bertuzzi incident, he defended such on-ice revenge, and suggested that Bertuzzi should not receive a suspension, because [...] "all they have to do is <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him</b> when he comes back." [...] That mindset echoed the comments made by Ken Hitchcock and Mark Recchi about Martin Havlat, and Sam Donnellon of the Philadelphia Daily News suggested that it was prevailing opinion amongst all the players in the League. He suggested that rather than wanting stricter penalties to clamp down on dangerous play, (which he advocated), the players believed that removing the penalty for instigating a fight, and allowing players to therefore get their retribution by that means, would have the same effect. Mike Heika of The Dallas Morning News also believed that the league should be stricter in handing out fines and suspensions, suggesting that Hitchcock should possibly have been penalised for his revenge comments, and that if Havlat had received a lengthier ban for his actions, the brawl between the Flyers and Senators may not have happened.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, a Battlestar Galactica and Star Wars-inspired space fight is shown between Stewie, Rupert, and a giant {{spaceship}} {{in the shape of}} Peter's head, along with a series of lookalike TIE fighters. In addition, Stewie paraphrases a series of lyrics from the 1972 single [...] "Rocket Man" [...] by singer-songwriter and composer Elton John. When Brian's script is brought up during breakfast, Peter mentions his own idea for a script entitled Bigger Jaws, in which the shark from the 1975 film Jaws has to team up with the guys, including Martin Brody, Quint and Matt Hooper, to <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him</b> to get [...] "bigger Jaws." [...] After it is produced, Peter already has a sequel in mind called Way Bigger Jaws. A historical cutaway gag portrays Adolf Hitler thinking he is being rejected by the publishing house for his submission of the autobiographical Mein Kampf, in which a publisher tells him, [...] "We didn't like it... we loved it!" [...] – to which Hitler replies, [...] "I could have killed you, Mr. Weinberg!" [...] Most of the storyline following Stewie, Chris and Meg is an homage to the 1989 film Weekend at Bernie's. The episode's title is also a reference to the TBS series Tyler Perry's House of Payne. As the family gathers around the television to watch Brian's show, actors Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer and Angus T. Jones of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men appear in the Griffin family living room, with Sheen attacking Brian for always criticizing their show.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} fight, Henderson stated that [...] "I hit him hard, but I got that last blow in just to {{shut him up}} a little bit." [...] After UFC {{president}} Dana White said Henderson had made the comment in jest, Henderson clarified by stating, [...] "When you're {{in the heat of}} the moment, the ref hadn't stopped me yet, who knows what's going to happen, if he's going to recover. I really only hit him twice, once on my feet, once on the ground. I didn't keep going. I didn't <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him</b> after the ref tried to stop me, it was nothing like that. It was a reaction of mine to keep going until I was stopped—and you know, it did feel good though." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{charges against}} Dr. Eppes are dropped. For a time, Don Eppes' team is {{attempting}} {{to make do with}} Fleinhardt's and Amita's expertise, but Charles' assistance is sorely missed to the point of consulting him secretly. [...] For his part, Charles has been convinced by his lawyer and father to attempt to have his clearance restored. Even Don supports the idea and stands up to security clearance investigator Carl McGowan (Keith Carradine), stating to <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> not his brother. Temporarily, Charlie works as a LAPD consultant until the fiasco with his security clearance can be resolved. He later gets his clearance back and is working with his brother and the FBI again. He is trying to assert himself in the methodology used to solve a crime, having struggled with not being included, but some friction arises with Amita and Larry.|$|E
2500|$|Infielder Stephen Drew {{returned}} from the disabled list, with Grace once again optioned to Syracuse, and the Nationals began a nine-game swing through California on May 29. On {{the first game of}} the road trip, the Nationals obtained their second shutout win of the year, beating the San Francisco Giants 3–0 behind a strong start by Tanner Roark. The game was marred, however, by an eighth-inning brawl that broke out after Giants reliever Hunter Strickland, facing Harper for the first time since the Nationals right fielder went 2-for-2 with two home runs off him during the 2014 National League Division Series, drilled Harper in the hip with a 98mph fastball with his first pitch. Harper tossed aside his bat and charged Strickland on the mound, throwing his helmet wide to the left of Strickland before the two players traded punches. They were separated by their teammates, with Giants first baseman and former National Michael Morse quickly getting between them before being bowled over (and concussed) by Giants pitcher and former University of Notre Dame football star Jeff Samardzija, and ejected from the game. Harper said after the game that he decided immediately that the pitch was intentional: [...] "You never want to get suspended or anything like that, but sometimes you've got to go and get him. You can't hesitate. You either go to first base or you <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> and I decided to go after him." [...] He suggested Strickland was retaliating for the 2014 home runs (which Strickland denied), saying, [...] "It was three years ago. ... I don't know why he's thinking about it. He's got a World Series ring, it's on his finger, and he can look at it every single night he wants to." [...] Both Harper and Strickland were issued suspensions by Major League Baseball, with Harper receiving a four-game penalty, which was lowered on appeal to three games. He began serving the suspension on May 31.|$|E
