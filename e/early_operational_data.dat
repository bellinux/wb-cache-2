Additional capabilities will largely depend upon a given activity, and should be easily reconfigurable to maximize the diversity of applications and experiments. To address this issue, we introduce a modular architecture originally developed and tested in the design and implementation of the X-RHex hexapod that allows the robot to operate as a mobile laboratory on legs. In the present paper we will introduce the specification, design and very <b>earliest</b> <b>operational</b> <b>data</b> of Canid, an actively driven compliant-spined quadruped whose completely different morphology and intended dynamical operating point are nevertheless built around exactly the same “Lab on Legs ” actuation, computation, and sensing infrastructure.

40|$|Abstract—Operational network data, {{management}} data such as {{customer care}} call logs and equipment system logs, {{is a very}} important source of information for network operators to detect problems in their networks. Unfortunately, there is lack of efficient tools to automatically track and detect anomalous events on <b>operational</b> <b>data,</b> causing ISP operators to rely on manual inspection of this data. While anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of network <b>data,</b> <b>operational</b> <b>data</b> presents several new challenges, including the volatility and sparseness of data, and the need to perform fast detection (com-plicating application of schemes that require offline processing or large/stable data sets to converge). To address these challenges, we propose Tiresias, an auto-mated approach to locating anomalous events on hierarchical <b>operational</b> <b>data.</b> Tiresias leverages the hierarchical structure of <b>operational</b> <b>data</b> to identify high-impact aggregates (e. g., locations in the network, failure modes) likely to be associated with anomalous events. To accommodate different kinds of <b>operational</b> network <b>data,</b> Tiresias consists of an online detection algorithm with low time and space complexity, while preserving high detection accuracy.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedIn modern combat operations today {{the display of}} <b>operational</b> <b>data</b> is still tied to stove-piped and proprietary systems and software. Additionally, combat systems are still using 2 D displays of the battlefield in order to reflect {{a picture of the}} battlefield to the warfighter. Stepping away from stove-piped and proprietary systems and reflecting a 3 D picture of the battlefield is the direction that this thesis research explores. Research is conducted to explore technologies needed to provide operational forces with web-based 3 D visualizations of <b>operational</b> <b>data.</b> Technologies used in this research are XML, XSLT, JAVA, X 3 D and VRML. A prototype application is developed that allows for the 3 D display of <b>operational</b> <b>data.</b> The research demonstrates how <b>operational</b> <b>data</b> can be stored in a database and accessed through a web-based 3 D representation of the area of operation.
