5|$|Hammond {{introduced}} {{their first}} <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (<b>IC)</b> model, the Concorde, in 1971. The company had stopped manufacturing tonewheel organs entirely by 1975, {{due to increased}} financial inefficiency, and switched to making IC models full-time. Console models included the 8000 Aurora (1976) and 8000M Aurora (1977), which contained drawbars and a built-in rotating speaker. Spinet organs included the Romance series, manufactured between 1977 and 1983. In 1979, a Japanese offshoot, Nihon Hammond, introduced the X-5, a portable solid-state clone of the B-3.|$|E
5|$|The {{solid-state}} device came {{into its own}} with {{the invention of the}} transistor in 1947. Common {{solid-state device}}s include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (<b>IC)</b> and the light-emitting diode (LED).|$|E

25|$|Very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) is {{the process}} of creating an <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (<b>IC)</b> by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed. The microprocessor is a VLSI device. Before the introduction of VLSI technology most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An electronic circuit might consist of a CPU, ROM, RAM and other glue logic. VLSI allows IC makers to add all of these circuits into one chip.|$|E
