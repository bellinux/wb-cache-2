But in contrast to traditional organizations, Bitcoin {{does not have a}} CEO or top management team but instead developers who “write the rulebook,” i.e., define governance rules for the program (Narayanan et al. 2016, pp. 173 – 175). Bitcoin does not have headquarters, subsidiaries, or employees, but a <b>distributed</b> <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and miners who collect, verify, and update transactions on a shared public ledger that is publicly auditable. Decisions on code modifications are made through community-based democratic voting processes, backed by miners’ computing power for implementation (Narayanan et al. 2016, pp. 173 – 175).|$|E
40|$|This paper studies a load {{balancing}} game introduced by Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou, that {{is intended to}} model a set of users who share several internet-based resources. Some of the recent work on this topic has considered the problem of constructing Nash equilibria, which are choices of actions where each user has optimal utility given {{the actions of the}} other users. A related (harder) problem is to find sequences of utility-improving moves that lead to a Nash equilibrium, starting from some given assignment of resources to users. We consider the special case where all resources are the same as each other. It is known already that there exist efficient algorithms for finding Nash equilibria; our contribution here is to show furthermore that Nash equilibria for this type of game are reached rapidly by Randomized Local Search, a simple generic method for local optimization. Our motivation for studying Randomized Local Search is that (as we show) it can be realised by a simple <b>distributed</b> <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> that act selfishly, have no central control and only interact via the effect they have on the cost functions of resources...|$|E
40|$|The {{blogosphere}} {{refers to}} the <b>distributed</b> <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> opinions published on the WWW. Whereas centralized review sites such Amazon. com previously allowed users to post opinions on goods such as books and CDs, blogging software allows users to publish opinions on any topic without constraints on predefined schema. However, centralized review sites such as Amazon. com have one significant advantage: reviews pertaining to a single topic are collected together in one place, allowing readers to peruse a diverse range of opinions quickly. In this paper we examine how such a topiccentric view of the Blogosphere can be created. We characterise the problems in aligning similar concepts created by a set <b>of</b> distributed, autonomous <b>users</b> and describe current initiatives to solve the problem. Finally, we introduce the Tagsocratic project, a novel initiative to solve the concept alignment problem using techniques derived from research in language acquisition among distributed, autonomous agents. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} Web 2. 0 {{has led to}} the {{development}} of new information infrastructures, where the logic of collective action is becoming more heterogeneous and multilayered, derived not from a single core structure (e. g. a corporation), but from networked interdependencies. Although lay users and expert user-developers act collectively towards commonly shared goals (e. g. producing, mixing, ripping and sharing digital content), their actions are not collective but rather are instigated under complex motivational structures whereby no single individual or group of individuals has complete information regarding all likely combinations of future events. This article explores the complex interactions <b>of</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> lay <b>users,</b> expert developers and owners of new information infrastructures such as Flickr.

While heterogeneous networks promise cost-effective compute cycles, almost no software is available to aid in the design and implementation of their applications. In this paper, we couple the Zoom representation, designed to facilitate development of heterogeneous applications, with the HeNCE graphical language and tool, designed as a representation for an execution model of heterogeneous programs targeted to PVM. The combination of Zoom and HeNCE provides a hierarchical representation which exposes performance issues, and provides a means of automatically translating that representation into code executable on a heterogeneous <b>network</b> <b>of</b> computers. 1 Introduction Heterogeneous {{network computing}} enables {{the development of a}} single complex application using a <b>distributed</b> <b>network</b> <b>of</b> possibly dissimilar machines.

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{utilised}} {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to examine cerebral activation during performance of a classic motor task in which response suppression load was parametrically varied. Linear increases in activity were observed in a <b>distributed</b> <b>network</b> <b>of</b> regions across both cerebral hemispheres, although with more extensive involvement of the right prefrontal cortex. Activated regions included prefrontal, parietal and occipitotemporal cortices. Decreasing activation was similarly observed in a <b>distributed</b> <b>network</b> <b>of</b> regions. These response forms are discussed in terms of an increasing requirement for visual cue discrimination and suppression/selection of motor responses, and a decreasing probability of the occurrence of non-target stimuli and attenuation of a prepotent tendency to respond. The results support recent proposals for a dominant role for the right-hemisphere in performance of motor response suppression tasks that emphasise the importance of the right prefrontal cortex...|$|R

40|$|Persistent neural {{activity}} is a putative {{mechanism for the}} maintenance of working memories. Persistent activity relies on the activity <b>of</b> a <b>distributed</b> <b>network</b> <b>of</b> areas, but the differential contribution of each area remains unclear. We recorded single neurons in the human medial frontal cortex and medial temporal lobe while subjects held up to three items in memory. We found persistently active neurons in both areas. Persistent activity of hippocampal and amygdala neurons was stimulus-specific, formed stable attractors and was predictive of memory content. Medial frontal cortex persistent activity, on the other hand, was modulated by memory load and task set but was not stimulus-specific. Trial-by-trial variability in persistent activity in both areas was related to memory strength, because it predicted the speed and accuracy by which stimuli were remembered. This work reveals, in humans, direct evidence for a <b>distributed</b> <b>network</b> <b>of</b> persistently active neurons supporting working memory maintenance...|$|R
