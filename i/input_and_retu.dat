This paper examines how <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> outputs can be formalized in the Process Specification Language (PSL) to reduce ambiguity and increase expressiveness compared to conventional flow modeling representations. <b>Inputs</b> <b>and</b> outputs are {{shown to be}} early design stage notions independent of existing PSL concepts, preconditions and postconditions in particular. The paper defines axioms for <b>input</b> <b>and</b> output, and constraints on existing PSL concepts. Some of these relate early and late stage design, while others provide for multiple views of <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> outputs.

Next, we derive an unbiased minimum-variance filter to estimate the unknown <b>input</b> <b>and</b> the state, when the state space matrices are known.

40|$|Efficient <b>input</b> supply <b>and</b> service {{delivery}} may {{call for a}} hub approach where all the necessary <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> services are supplied in a coordinated manner, either by a single supplier or by several and separate entities in a given geographical location accessible to beneficiaries. Based on experience from Ada'a milk shed in central Ethiopia, this paper assesses the evolution of <b>input</b> supply <b>and</b> service provision in the dairy sub-sector, focusing on coordination {{and the degree of}} competition among different actors at different levels in the value chain over time. Data were collected from key value chain actors engaged in provision of <b>input</b> supply <b>and</b> output marketing services in Ada'a milk shed. The major lesson is that the development of coordinated <b>input</b> supply <b>and</b> {{service delivery}} by different business entities or under a single business entity may not emerge at once, but through a gradual evolution. This depends on the level of demand for the <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> services as determined by the degree of demand for milk and milk products, and the economies of scale <b>input</b> suppliers <b>and</b> service providers could attain from the expansion of demands for these <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> services. Moreover, at the early stage of a hub development, collective actions and integration of services and marketing within a business organisation could be the main strategy to attain efficiency. But, once the demand for <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> services has grown, competition among different entities will lead to more efficient <b>input</b> supply <b>and</b> service delivery. In general, where there is an increasing demand for <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> services, there is a faster development of <b>input</b> supply <b>and</b> service provision by private actors and collective actions in a more competitive way. Role of the public sector could change gradually from provision of <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> services to coordination, capacity building, quality control, and regulation...|$|R

30|$|As a conclusion, our {{proposed}} approach {{suggests an}} efficient alternative procedure to estimate predicted intervals for FR model with fuzzy <b>input</b> <b>and</b> output. As {{a limitation of}} our study, we only focused on fuzzy regression model in the case that <b>input</b> <b>and</b> output {{are assumed to be}} symmetric or nonsymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers. Therefore, we only considered FRBF Network when <b>input,</b> output <b>and</b> weights are triangular fuzzy numbers and we did not consider another types of fuzzy numbers in this study. Although the discussion of this study is confined to simple regression with one <b>input</b> <b>and</b> one output, it can be generalized to cope with cases of multiple <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> outputs. For future studies, more general fuzzy <b>inputs,</b> outputs <b>and</b> weights such as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers could be handled with our FRBF Network approach and it could be applied to different FR models.|$|R
