40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, a {{semi-active}} {{static output}} <b>feedback</b> <b>variable</b> structure control (VSC) strategy {{is presented to}} control a two-stage electrorheological (ER) floating raft isolation system. A continuous semi-active static output feedback VSC controller is designed and a bypass ER damper is applied to achieve the best control effect more rapidly and accurately. The sliding surface parameters are determined {{in terms of the}} Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion. The optimal vibration attenuation of the intermediate mass is guaranteed due to the control rule that damping force only dissipates the vibration energy of the intermediate mass. The robustness of the control method with respect to parameter variations and the effectiveness of vibration isolation are demonstrated by numerical simulation results. It shows that the designed semi-active static output feedback VSC strategy realized by the ER damper can achieve better performance than that of optimally passive damping even if system parameter uncertainties exist. In addition, the experiment was carried out to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the presented control scheme in this study. The experimental results are satisfied.

40|$|As modern {{engineering}} design usually involves dependence of one discipline on another, multidisciplinary system analysis (MDSA) {{plays an important}} role in the multidisciplinary simulation and design optimization on coupled systems. The paper proposes an MDSA method based on minimal <b>feedback</b> <b>variables</b> (MDSA_MF) to enhance the solving efficiency. There are two phases in the method. In phase 1, design structural matrix (DSM) is introduced to represent a coupled system, and each off-diagonal element is denoted by a coupling variable set; then an optimal sequence model is built to obtain a reordered DSM with minimal number of <b>feedback</b> <b>variables.</b> In phase 2, the feedback in the reordered DSM is broken, so that the coupled system is transformed into one directed acyclic graph; then, regarding the inputs depending on the broken <b>feedback</b> as independent <b>variables,</b> a least-squares problem is constructed to minimize the residuals of these independents and corresponding outputs to zero, which means the multidisciplinary consistence is achieved. Besides, the MDSA_MF method is implemented in a multidisciplinary platform called FlowComputer. Several examples of coupled systems are modeled and solved in the platform using several MDSA methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method could enhance the solving efficiency of coupled systems...|$|R
