Stiffness also occurs in <b>fibrotic</b> <b>conditions</b> such as shoulder capsulitis and Dupuytren's contracture.

Using the TwinsUK NIHR BRC BioResource we tested the hypotheses that 1) joint (hip and knee) stiffness, TJR (hip and knee), and <b>fibrotic</b> <b>conditions</b> are associated and 2) genetic factors contribute to them. Participating twins (n = 9718) had completed self-reported questionnaires on the traits of interest. All three traits {{were significantly associated with}} increasing age and body mass index (BMI), as well as female sex, on univariate analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed a significant association between TJR and joint stiffness (OR = 3. 96, 95 % confidence interval, CI 2. 77 - 5. 68) and between <b>fibrotic</b> <b>conditions</b> and joint stiffness (OR = 2. 39, 1. 74 - 3. 29), adjusting for age, sex, BMI and twin relatedness. Monozygotic versus dizygotic intraclass correlations gave heritability estimates for TJR = 46 % and joint stiffness = 32 %.

40|$|Metzincins and {{functionally}} related genes play {{important roles}} in extracellular matrix remodeling both in healthy and <b>fibrotic</b> <b>conditions.</b> We recently presented a transcriptomic classifier consisting of 19 metzincins and related genes (MARGS) discriminating biopsies from renal transplant patients with or without interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA) by virtue of gene expression measurement (Roedder et al., Am J Transplant 9 : 517 - 526, 2009). Here we demonstrate that the same algorithm has diagnostic value in non-transplant solid organ fibrosis. We used publically available microarray datasets of 325 human heart, liver, lung, kidney cortex, and pancreas microarray samples (265 with fibrosis, 60 healthy controls). Expression of nine commonly differentially expressed genes was confirmed by TaqMan low-density arrays (Applied Biosystems, USA) in 50 independent archival tissue specimens with matched histological diagnoses to microarray patients. In separate and in combined, integrated microarray data analyses of five datasets with 325 samples, the previously published MARGS classifier for renal post-transplant IF/TA had a mean AUC of 87 % and 82 %, respectively. These data demonstrate that the MARGS gene panel classifier not only discriminates IF/TA from normal renal transplant tissue, but also classifies solid organ <b>fibrotic</b> <b>conditions</b> of human pancreas, liver, heart, kidney, and lung tissue samples with high specificity and accuracy, suggesting that the MARGS classifier is a cross-platform, cross-organ classifier of <b>fibrotic</b> <b>conditions</b> of different etiologies when compared to normal tissue...|$|E

By immunohistochemistry, aFGF and bFGF were abundant in pancreatic ductal and acinar cells in pancreatic tissues from CP patients. Immunoblotting with the same highly specific monoclonal antibodies demonstrated a marked increase in aFGF and bFGF in pancreatic homogenates from CP patients by comparison with the normal pancreas. Northern blot analysis indicated that, by comparison with normal controls, 16 of 21 CP tissues exhibited a 14 -fold increase in aFGF mRNA levels, and 19 of 21 CP tissues exhibited a 15 -fold increase in bFGF mRNA levels. In situ hybridization confirmed that this overexpression occurred in ductal and acinar cells, and indicated that both mRNA moieties colocalized with their respective proteins.

40|$|Liver {{fibrosis}} is a wound-healing {{response to}} chronic liver injury such as alcoholic/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and viral hepatitis with no FDA-approved treatments. Liver fibrosis {{results in a}} continual accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and paves the way for replacement of parenchyma with nonfunctional scar tissue. The <b>fibrotic</b> <b>condition</b> results in drastic changes in the local mechanical, chemical, and biological microenvironment of the tissue. Liver parenchyma is supported by an efficient network of vasculature lined by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). These nonparenchymal cells are highly specialized resident endothelial cell type with characteristic morphological and functional features. Alterations in LSECs phenotype including lack of LSEC fenestration, capillarization, and formation of an organized basement membrane {{have been shown to}} precede fibrosis and promote hepatic stellate cell activation. Here, we review the interplay of LSECs with the dynamic changes in the fibrotic liver microenvironment such as matrix rigidity, altered ECM protein profile, and cell-cell interactions to provide insight into the pivotal changes in LSEC physiology {{and the extent to which}} it mediates the progression of liver fibrosis. Establishing the molecular aspects of LSECs in the light of fibrotic microenvironment is valuable towards development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets of liver fibrosis...|$|R

40|$|Fibrosis is a {{major player}} in {{cardiovascular}} disease, both as a contributor to the development of disease, as well as a post-injury response that drives progression. Despite the identification of many mechanisms responsible for cardiovascular fibrosis, to date no treatments have emerged that have effectively reduced the excess deposition of extracellular matrix associated with <b>fibrotic</b> <b>conditions.</b> Novel treatments have recently been identified that hold promise as potential therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases associated with fibrosis, as well as other <b>fibrotic</b> <b>conditions.</b> The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of emerging antifibrotic agents that have shown encouraging results in preclinical or early clinical studies, but have not yet been approved for use in human disease. One of these agents is bone morphogenetic protein- 7 (BMP 7), which has beneficial effects in multiple models of fibrotic disease. Another approach discussed involves altering the levels of micro-RNA (miR) species, including miR- 29 and miR- 101, which regulate the expression of fibrosis-related gene targets. Further, the antifibrotic potential of agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors will be discussed. Finally, evidence will be reviewed in support of the polypeptide hormone relaxin. Relaxin is long known for its extracellular remodeling properties in pregnancy, and is rapidly emerging as an effective antifibrotic agent in a number of organ systems. Moreover, relaxin has potent vascular and renal effects that make it a particularly attractive approach for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In each case, the mechanism of action and the applicability to various fibrotic diseases will be discussed...|$|E

On a functional level, FAP features dipeptidyl- and endopeptidase activity and seems to be involved in tumour cell proliferation [21, 26]. A recent study even suggested that FAP inhibition might be beneficial for treating epithelial-derived tumours, since pharmacologic targeting of FAP inhibited tumour stromagenesis by affecting integrin-mediated signalling and led to a decreased recruitment and overall number of myofibroblasts [27]. Therefore, one might speculate, whether FAP could be a potential target for the treatment of CD-associated intestinal fibrosis.|$|E
30|$|In a {{previous}} study reported by Fujimoto M and his colleagues that the HSP 47 antibody was elevated in the serum of SSc patients (Fujimoto et al., 2004), however, the expression level of HSP 47 protein in the serum was unclear, and our study found that an elevated HSP 47 protein level was observed in the plasma of SSc patients, at the same time, the mRNA level of HSP 47 was also found elevated in the PBMC from SSc, suggesting HSP 47 might become a serum marker of the fibrosis activity of SSc. Since HSP 47 has intracellular location and does not secrete out of cells, {{it seems that the}} elevated sera level of HSP 47 in mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and rheumatic diseases (Yokota et al., 2003) and the higher plasma level of HSP 47 detected in SSc in our study are produced by the apoptotic cells under the inflammatory and <b>fibrotic</b> <b>condition.</b> Whereas our further analysis demonstrated that both mRNA and plasma levels of HSP 47 had a significant correlation with the presence of anti-centromere antibody, which is usually more common in patients with limited scleroderma, and a biomarker for better prognosis for SSc patients (Mehra et al., 2013). Thus, an increased level of HSP 47 might be a potential serum biomarker for better prognosis of SSc patients.|$|R
40|$|Obesity and {{diabetes}} is increasing exponentially {{and this is}} accompanied with prevalence of metabolic diseases like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an inflammatory often <b>fibrotic</b> <b>condition</b> of the liver. Fibrotic NASH is characterised by matrix turnover but the regulation of matrix degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs) remains poorly characterised. The aim of this thesis was to explore the role of MMPs and their regulator CD 147 in NASH pathogenesis. Using a novel murine model of diet-induced obesity with added diabetes we showed characteristic temporal changes in MMP activity that increases with severity of NASH. Hepatocyte expression and glycosylation of CD 147 also increases. By in-vitro studies we determined CD 147 in hepatocytes were up-regulated by saturated free fatty acids and glucose via ERK 1 / 2 and PI 3 K/Akt pathways. CD 147 in cell membranes or when released in microparticles induced MMPs in hepatic cells, an effect abrogated by anti-CD 147 antibody. We validated the possible role of microparticles in-vivo where microparticle concentration, particularly those expressing hepatocyte CD 147 increased in NASH livers. This thesis establishes that MMPs and CD 147 are regulated in NASH progression, and shows MMPs activity is induced by CD 147 via cell membrane interaction or via microparticles. Blocking MMP activity or CD 147 is therefore a logical therapeutic approach in NASH. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney. UniKey credentials are required.

40|$|Nonalcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} or NASH is {{an excessive}} accumulation {{of fat in}} hepatocytes accompanied by inflammation and hepatic injury. Proinflammatory molecules such as IL- 17, CCL 20, S 100 A 8, S 100 A 9, and S 100 A 8 /A 9 {{have been shown to}} be implicated in many types of cancer. Telomerase activity has been found to be associated with chronic inflammation and cancer. NASH can progress to fibrosis then cirrhosis and finally to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our objective is to try to find a relation between inflammation and the progression of NASH into HCC. We found that there was a significant elevation in the telomerase activity, detected by real-time PCR, between NASH and fibrotic NASH in the liver biopsies of patients. The expression of S 100 A 8, S 100 A 9, S 100 A 8 /A 9, CCL 20, and IL- 17, detected by ELISA, is significantly increased in NASH patients with fibrosis in comparison with controls. But, in NASH patients, S 100 A 9, S 100 A 8 /A 9, and IL- 17 only are significantly elevated in comparison with controls. The same, on the mRNA level, expression of IL- 17, detected by RT-PCR, is significantly elevated in NASH patients in comparison with controls. Therefore, there is a direct link between the expression of IL- 17, CCL 20, telomerase, S 100 A 8, and S 100 A 9 in the <b>fibrotic</b> <b>condition</b> and the progression towards cancer...|$|R
40|$|Fibrosis {{occurs when}} there is an {{imbalance}} in extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and degradation. Excessive ECM deposition results in scarring and thickening of the affected tissue, and interferes with tissue and organ homeostasis – mimicking an exaggerated “wound healing” response. Many transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) ligands are potent drivers of ECM deposition, and additionally, have a natural affinity for the ECM, creating a concentrated pool of pro-fibrotic factors at the site of injury. Consequently, TGF-β ligands are upregulated in many human <b>fibrotic</b> <b>conditions</b> and, as such, are attractive targets for fibrosis therapy. Here, we will discuss the contribution of TGF-β proteins in the pathogenesis of fibrosis, and promising anti-fibrotic approaches that target TGF-β ligands...|$|E

40|$|Angiogenesis {{emerges in}} {{parallel}} with liver fibrosis, {{but it is still}} unclear whether angiogenesis is a defense mechanism of the body in response to fibrosis, or whether it aggravates the <b>fibrotic</b> <b>condition.</b> In this thesis, Amirah Adlia applied different approaches to elucidate the role of angiogenesis in fibrosis. She started by targeting the anti-angiogenic cytokine, interferon alpha (IFNα), to the hepatocytes in fibrotic livers with the aim to study the role of hepatocytes in fibrosis-associated angiogenesis. It was shown that both IFNα and targeted IFNα inhibited angiogenesis, but did not affect fibrosis development in vivo. This was supported by another approach in this thesis using liver slices to elucidate the role of angiogenesis in the development of fibrosis. The pro-angiogenic factor VEGF-A had no direct stimulating effect on liver fibrotic genes. In addition, no correlation was found between factors of these two pathological processes. Thus, based on these studies it was concluded that angiogenesis is present in fibrotic livers but does not influence fibrosis progression in the liver. In addition, the liver slice studies yielded a new ex vivo angiogenesis model to study in particular fibrosis-associated angiogenesis. To date, most of the angiogenesis models were developed for cancer, and there is the lack of specific assay that represents this pathological condition in liver fibrosis. The results indicated that studies using precision-cut slices offer a promising ex vivo model to investigate disease-associated angiogenesis, which will contribute to the reduction, replacement, and refinement of animal experiments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDupuytren's disease (DD) is {{a common}} <b>fibrotic</b> <b>condition</b> of the palmar fascia, leading to {{deposition}} of collagen-rich cords and progressive flexion of the fingers. The molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are poorly understood. We have previously shown altered expression of extracellular matrix-degrading proteases (matrix metalloproteases, MMPs, and ‘a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain with thrombospondin motifs’, ADAMTS, proteases) in palmar fascia from DD patients compared to control and shown that {{the expression of a}} sub-set of these genes correlates with post-operative outcome. In the current study we used an in vitro model of collagen contraction to identify the specific proteases which mediate this effect. We measured the expression of all MMPs, ADAMTSs and their inhibitors in fibroblasts derived from the palmar fascia of DD patients, both in monolayer culture and in the fibroblast-populated collagen lattice (FPCL) model of cell-mediated contraction. Key proteases, previously identified in our tissue studies, were expressed in vitro and regulated by tension in the FPCL, including MMP 1, 2, 3, 13 and 14. Knockdown of MMP 2 and MMP 14 (but not MMP 1, 3 and 13) inhibited cell-mediated contraction, and knockdown of MMP 14 inhibited proMMP- 2 activation. Interestingly, whilst collagen is degraded during the FPCL assay, this is not altered upon knockdown of any of the proteases examined. We conclude that MMP- 14 (via its ability to activate proMMP- 2) and MMP- 2 are key proteases in collagen contraction mediated by fibroblasts in DD patients. These proteases may be drug targets or act as biomarkers for disease progression...|$|R
40|$|Dupuytren’s {{disease is}} a common <b>fibrotic</b> <b>condition</b> of the hand {{affecting}} 4 % {{of the population and}} causes the fingers to curl irreversibly into the palm. It has a strong familial tendency, there is no approved treatment for early stage disease, and patients with established digital contractures are most commonly treated by surgery. This is associated with prolonged recovery, and less invasive techniques have high recurrence rates. The myofibroblasts, the cells responsible for the excessive matrix deposition and contraction, are aggregated in nodules. Using excised diseased and control human tissue, we found that immune cells interspersed amongst the myofibroblasts secrete cytokines. Of these, only tumour necrosis factor (TNF) promoted the development of myofibroblasts. The clinically approved anti-TNF agents led to inhibition of the myofibroblast phenotype in vitro. This clinical trial is designed to assess the efficacy of the anti-TNF agent adalimumab on participants with early disease. The first part is a dose-ranging study where nodules of participants already scheduled for surgery will be injected with either placebo (saline) or varying doses of adalimumab. The excised tissue will then be analysed for markers of myofibroblast activity. The second part of the study will recruit participants with early stage disease. They will be randomised 1 : 1 to receive either adalimumab or placebo at 3 month intervals over 1 year and will then be followed for a further 6 months. Outcome measures will include nodule hardness, size and disease progression. The trial will also determine the cost-effectiveness of adalimumb treatment for this group of participants...|$|R

Multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS) were used as the regression methods and stepwise, Genetic algorithm (GA), and simulated annealing (SA) were used as the feature selection methods. Three of the statistically best significant models were chosen from the results for discussion. Model 1 was obtained by MLR–SA methodology at a radius of 1. 6. This model with a coefficient of determination (r 2) = 0. 71 can well predict the real inhibitor activities. Cross-validated q 2 of this model, 0. 64, indicates good internal predictive power of the model. External validation of the model (pred_r 2 = 0. 85) showed that the model can well predict activity of novel PCP inhibitors. The model 2 which developed using PLS–SW explains 72 % (r 2 = 0. 72) of the total variance in the training set as well as it has internal (q 2) and external (pred_r 2) predictive ability of ∼ 67 % and ∼ 71 % respectively. The last developed model by PCR–SA has a correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0. 68 which can explains 68 % {{of the variance in the}} observed activity values.

During ischaemia, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is converted to hypoxanthine and xanthine, and endothelial xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase (alcohol also mediates this change, a finding of particular relevance given the association of Dupuytren's contracture with alcohol intake). Xanthine oxidase catalyses the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and uric acid {{with the release of}} superoxide free radicals (O 2 -), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and hydroxyl radicals (OH.). These free radicals are highly reactive, with half-lives in the order of milliseconds and are toxic in high concentrations. A potential for free radical generation in Dupuytren's contracture was elicited by finding a sixfold increase in hypoxanthine concentrations in Dupuytren's contracture compared with control palmar fascia. In vitro studies affirmed the toxic effects of oxygen free radicals to Dupuytren's contracture fibroblasts, but also showed that, at lower concentrations (concentrations similar to those likely to occur in Dupuytren's contracture), free radicals had a stimulatory effect on fibroblast proliferation. Cultured fibroblasts were found to release their own O 2 -. These endogenously released free radicals were also found to be important in fibroblast proliferation.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH is an excessive accumulation of fat in hepatocytes accompanied by inflammation and hepatic injury. Proinflammatory molecules such as IL- 17, CCL 20, S 100 A 8, S 100 A 9, and S 100 A 8 /A 9 {{have been shown to}} be implicated in many types of cancer. Telomerase activity has been found to be associated with chronic inflammation and cancer. NASH can progress to fibrosis then cirrhosis and finally to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our objective is to try to find a relation between inflammation and the progression of NASH into HCC. We found that there was a significant elevation in the telomerase activity, detected by real-time PCR, between NASH and fibrotic NASH in the liver biopsies of patients. The expression of S 100 A 8, S 100 A 9, S 100 A 8 /A 9, CCL 20, and IL- 17, detected by ELISA, is significantly increased in NASH patients with fibrosis in comparison with controls. But, in NASH patients, S 100 A 9, S 100 A 8 /A 9, and IL- 17 only are significantly elevated in comparison with controls. The same, on the mRNA level, expression of IL- 17, detected by RT-PCR, is significantly elevated in NASH patients in comparison with controls. Therefore, there is a direct link between the expression of IL- 17, CCL 20, telomerase, S 100 A 8, and S 100 A 9 in the <b>fibrotic</b> <b>condition</b> and the progression towards cancer. 1...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} demonstrated that human dermal fibroblasts express both {{constitutive and inducible}} nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and produce nitric oxide (NO). In this study, NOS expression and NO production were compared in human fibroblasts derived from hypertrophic scar (HSc) and site-matched normal dermis. NOS expression and NO production in HSc fibroblasts are significantly reduced when compared with normal fibroblasts. Without stimulation, the HSc fibroblasts produced 7. 37 ± 1. 17 nmol and the normal fibroblasts produced 11. 15 ± 0. 79 nmol/ 10 &sub 6; cells/ 96 h (paired t test, p < 0. 01, n= 6) NO {{as determined by the}} Griess reaction. After stimulation with 200 units interferon-γ per ml and 40 μg lipo-polysaccharide per ml, both HSc and normal fibroblasts produced significantly higher NO, indicating that the HSc fibroblasts retain the capacity to express inducible NOS (iNOS). The Ca 2 +-dependent NOS (cNOS) activity in the cytosol of HSc fibroblasts (1. 43 pmol/min/g of protein) was significantly lower than that in normal fibroblasts (2. 60 pmol/min/g of protein), as determined by citrulline assay (p < 0. 01, n= 4). The mRNAs for endothelial cNOS and iNOS in both HSc and normal fibroblasts were detectable by RT-PCR. Flow cytometry confirmed that the untreated HSc fibroblasts expressed less endothelial cNOS protein than untreated normal fibroblasts. Because NO markedly inhibits cell proliferation, our results suggest that after thermal injury, fibroblasts in the scar tissue may undergo phenotypic alteration leading to reduced endothelial cNOS expression. The low levels of endogenous NO in HSc fibroblasts might be responsible for the cellularity of post-burn HSc, a characteristic feature of this <b>fibrotic</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|R
