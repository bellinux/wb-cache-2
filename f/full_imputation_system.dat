40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the 2001 tax reform in Germany on {{dividend}} announcement returns. With this major tax reform, the <b>full</b> <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> was replaced by the half-income system, which {{had a significant impact on}} the relative taxation of dividends and capital gains for most investor classes. In an event study framework, we separate the tax effect of dividends from their positive signaling and agency cost effects to offer a more comprehensive picture of the valuation implications of dividends in Germany. Controlling for signaling and agency cost effects of dividends we find that the market response to positive dividend surprises is more pronounced under the <b>full</b> <b>imputation</b> <b>system,</b> where dividends are generally more favorable to investors from a tax perspective, than under the half-income system. Our results suggest that the observed decline in the dividend response coefficient is synchronized with the 2001 tax reform and hence attributable to the 2001 tax reform.

The analysis jointly focuses on the tax-based preferences of five categories of shareholders, including both domestic and foreign-domiciled shareholder classes. Incorporating the dividend franking percentage as a direct measure {{of the degree of}} tax benefit associated with dividends, strong evidence supporting the existence of tax-based dividend clienteles is present for both domestic and foreign shareholder categories. This includes domestic corporate blockholders and company directors, and local institutional investors following tax reforms in 2000, and foreign institutional shareholders which, alternatively, demand lower dividends and dividend franking. These findings persist after considering the effect of share repurchases, and under various model specifications controlling for unobserved firm heterogeneity and potential endogeneity between ownership structure and dividend payout policy.

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} comparative and comprehensive understanding of corporate dividend policy in European Countries. I examine the dividend policy of the firm in the UK, Germany, France and Italy. The thesis is motivated by the importance of dividend policy theory {{in the area of}} finance, the mixed theoretical and empirical evidence, the predominately US based literature and by the financial, institutional and corporate governance differences between European countries. The thesis examines the "big three imperfections" of the dividend policy: taxation, asymmetric information and agency costs. The uniqueness of the thesis is its European character. The main argument is that differences in taxation and corporate governance systems between European countries can prove a useful tool for providing some answers to the dividend puzzle. With respect to dividend taxation systems the UK operates a partial <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> while Germany, France and Italy operate <b>full</b> <b>imputation</b> <b>systems.</b> With respect to the corporate governance systems the UK is characterised as a market-based country while Germany, France and Italy are characterised as bank-based systems. In general results show that there are significant differences between dividend taxation systems in European countries that result in variations of the tax discrimination variable. In all countries ex-day returns are positive and significant suggesting that ex-day prices fall by less than the amount of dividends. Results confirm that in countries where the differential taxation between dividends and capital gains is high, ex-day returns are high. Also, I find that changes in the tax systems that affect taxes on dividend and/or capital gains alter significantly ex-day returns. Furthermore, the corporate governance differences between market-based and bank-based countries result in different levels of information asymmetries and/or agency conflicts. Results in all the countries show significant share price reaction on the dividend announcement days. Evidence provides support to the information content of dividend hypothesis. Moreover, I do not find evidence to reject the signalling hypothesis over the over investment hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of the recent Finnish income tax reform on the behaviour of a closely held corporation (CHC) and its owners. The main elements of the reform are cuts in corporate and capital income tax rates and the replacement of the current <b>full</b> <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> by a partial double taxation of distributed profits. Considerable exemptions are applied to relieve the taxation of dividends from CHCs. The analysis indicates that the change in the CHC?s cost of capital depends on the marginal tax rate (MTR) of the owner. In the case of a high-MTR entrepreneur, the cost of capital increases or is retained at the present level while at lower MTRs the cost of capital may well decrease. The latter observation is due to the increase in the tax rate gap between earned income and capital income. Thus the reform does not remove the earlier reported nonneutralities of the Finnish tax system. The reform also improves the position of wage income as a form of compensation. This will cushion the effect of the dividend tax changes on the CHC?s cost of capital. Capital income taxation, dual income tax, tax reform...|$|E
40|$|An {{overlooked}} {{aspect of}} the debate surrounding Australia’s dividend imputation system is the international experience with dividend imputation. Between 1999 and 2008, nine countries removed their dividend imputation systems. A number of questions arise. What was the motivation for removing imputation? How were dividends taxed after imputation was removed? What happened to corporate tax rates? And ultimately, what are the lessons for Australia? This paper seeks to provide answers to these questions. Along with Canada, Chile, Mexico and New Zealand, Australia is one of o nly five countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that continues to operate a full imputation tax system where all corporate tax is credited to domestic shareholders. Malta, a non-OECD country, also has a <b>full</b> <b>imputation</b> <b>system.</b> The OECD lists Korea and the United Kingdom as operating partial imputation systems. However, as the tax credits provided in these countries are not linked {{to the amount of}} corporate tax paid, these are not true imputation tax systems. Many countries have shifted away from imputation systems, including the United Kingdom (1999), Ireland (1999), Germany (2001), Singapore (2003), Italy (2004), Finland (2005), France (2005), Norway (2006) and Malaysia (2008).

40|$|The {{majority}} of {{experts agree that}} taxes are distortionary in nature. This is relatively true {{for all of the}} different groups of taxes, but for the corporate taxes is exceptionally obvious. The existence of the corporate tax system can affect the company’s behavior in number of ways {{and one of the most}} criticized is the ability for distortion of the choice of the sources of finance. In the following article, we explore the effects from corporate taxation on investment, through the methodological frame of the effective marginal tax rates. The objective is to analyze the investment decision in the case of isolated implementation of corporate taxes which means that the effects from the so-called “double taxation”, induced by the personal taxes are not taken in consideration. We hope to prove that these conditions generate “uneven” distribution of the burden across the projects covered with different sources of finance. Also, we intend to test and explore the properties of some alternative corporate tax systems which are widely known as neutral, such as: the comprehensive business income tax <b>system</b> (CBIT), the <b>imputation</b> corporate tax <b>system</b> (ICT), the <b>full</b> <b>imputation</b> corporate tax <b>system</b> (FICT), the allowance for corporate equity tax system (ACE) and the split rate corporate tax system (SRCT).

40|$|The {{classical}} system of taxation, whereby companies are taxed without a deduction for dividends paid and shareholders are taxed on their dividend receipts, results in double taxation of dividends. Split rate and imputation {{systems have been}} developed {{in an attempt to}} mitigate the effects of double taxation of dividends. Double taxation of dividends and differences between corporate and maximum individual marginal tax rates result in corporate tax systems lacking neutrality. Distortions arise between organisational forms, between debt and equity financing and between the retention and distribution of profits. Various methods of integrating corporate and individual taxes have been advocated to overcome the lack of neutrality caused by corporate taxes. Following the introduction of the South African Income Tax Act in 1914, a number of taxes relating to dividends have existed. These have included a Dividend Tax, Non-resident Shareholder's Tax, Undistributed Profits Tax and Secondary Tax on Companies, hereafter referred to as STC. STC is a tax on net dividends declared and results in distributed income being taxed at higher rates than retained income. Despite the implementation of group relief provisions, STC results in an inhibition on the reinvestment of profits {{within the context of a}} group of companies. It is also a major cause of the lack of neutrality of the South African corporate tax system. As a result of the lack of neutrality and inhibition of group reinvestment caused by STC, a <b>full</b> <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> is suggested as an alternative to replace STC. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of different systems of current income and capital gains taxation on investor's decision to either carry out an investment in corporate shares or to invest funds alternatively on the capital market. Three basic tax systems are analyzed, a classical corporate tax system with double taxation of profits on corporate and personal level, a shareholder relief system, that reduces double taxation completely. It can be shown that general analytical solutions for the investment problem for different categories of tax regimes, even under certainty, cannot be derived. Applying a growth model, we find under rather restrictive assumptions that the shareholder relief system invokes more severe distortions than the <b>full</b> <b>imputation</b> <b>system.</b> Trying to prove this in a more realistic setting with uncertainty we employ Monte Carlo Simulation for random rates of return and random income tax rates. In many cases, the degree of tax-induced uncertainty is significantly lower under a shareholder relied system than under full imputation. Furthermore, it can be shown that under uncertainty full imputation causes more severe distortions than shareholder relief whenever personal income tax rates are low. In light of international tax competition {{this is an important}} result as a reduction of tax rates is taking place or is likely to take place in several countries. Furthermore, the simulation clarifies the trade-off of the opposing effects, i. e. tax and interest rate effects, and the overwhelming impact of capital gains taxation. Apart from tax parameters, we identify the dividend rate and the point in time of selling the shares as important value drivers.

Relative to market benchmarks and ownership levels across firms, institutional funds are overweight in stocks that pay dividends.

Instead we find an inverted U relationship between institutional ownership and dividend yield. The tax hypothesis dominates the prudent-man hypothesis in explaining ownership by institutional clienteles.

40|$|This article {{examines}} methods to efficiently estimate the mean response in a linear model with an unknown error distribution {{under the assumption}} that the responses are missing at random. We show how the asymptotic variance is affected by the estimator of the regression parameter and by the imputation method. To estimate the regression parameter the Ordinary Least Squares method is efficient only if the error distribution happens to be normal. If the errors are not normal, then we propose a One Step Improvement estimator or a Maximum Empirical Likelihood estimator to estimate the parameter efficiently. In order to investigate the impact that imputation has on estimation of the mean response, we compare the Listwise Deletion method and the Propensity Score method (which do not use imputation at all), and two imputation methods. We show that Listwise Deletion and the Propensity Score method are inefficient. Partial Imputation, where only the missing responses are imputed, is compared to <b>Full</b> <b>Imputation,</b> where both missing and non-missing responses are imputed.

Australian shareholders will access their franking benefits on a pro rata basis, ie in proportion to their shareholding in the NZ company. The taxation problems created by trans-Tasman triangular investments and the background to the enactment of Div 220 are examined in [220. 1040].

In fact the current worldwide trend is towards credit and exemption regimes partly because of issues such as conduit and triangular taxation.

More attention should be afforded to how imputation influences the behaviour of investors and companies.
