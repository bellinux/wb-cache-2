Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is an effective, non‐conservative tracer for use in <b>hydrograph</b> <b>separations</b> of karst waters because of the ubiquitous nature of carbon in the sources of waters to caves and springs and unique concentrations and isotopic compositions of carbon inputs. DIC concentration and isotopic composition (δ¹³C‐DIC) in rain are typically calculated based on atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) using equilibrium carbonate reactions and stable carbon isotope fractionation values. As atmospheric CO₂ changes, traditional assumptions applied in attaining calculated values can result in error, and better estimates of rain DIC are needed. The concentration and isotopic composition of rain DIC in the karst of northwestern Arkansas was calculated using Python™ programming language based on local atmospheric CO₂ and rain pH data from 2011 to 2013.

Models require a time series of isotopes in precipitation (δ 18 O ppt) to drive simulations, and throughout much of the world – particularly in sparsely populated high-latitude regions – these data are not widely available. Here we investigate the impact that choice of precipitation isotope product (δ 18 O ppt) has on simulations of streamflow, δ 18 O in streamflow (δ 18 O SF), resulting <b>hydrograph</b> <b>separations,</b> and model parameters. In a high-latitude, data-sparse, seasonal basin (Fort Simpson, NWT, Canada), we assess three precipitation isotope products of different spatial and temporal resolutions (i. e. semi-annual static, seasonal KPN 43, and daily bias-corrected REMOiso), and apply them to force the isoWATFLOOD tracer-aided hydrologic model. Total simulated streamflow is not significantly impacted by choice of δ 18 O ppt product; however, simulated isotopes in streamflow (δ 18 O SF) and the internal apportionment of water (driven by model parameterization) are impacted. The highest-resolution product (REMOiso) was distinct from the two lower-resolution products (KPN 43 and static), but could not be verified as correct {{due to a lack of}} daily δ 18 O ppt observations.

The use of {{secondary}} and tertiary treat-ment of wastewater {{and the treatment}} of stormwater in the Metropolitan Atlanta area has mitigated many of the water-quality problems associated with urbanization in the upper Chattahoochee River Basin. However, treat-ment has not reduced total nitrogen. The engineering of urban watersheds to efficiently convey stormwater run-off has succeeded in moderating flooding in urban areas; however, increased stormflow volumes and streamflow velocities have degraded the physical structure of some streams and reduced the baseflow component of total streamflow. Nationwide, urbanization is increasing the volume of wastewater that requires treatment. For this study, effluent discharge-monitoring data reported by wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs) with outflows greater than 1 million gallons per day (Mgal/d) were analyzed in conjunction with instream nutrient con-centrations to estimate phosphorus and nitrogen loads for the Chattahoochee River.

In the 1993 snowmelt period, two-component isotopic <b>hydrograph</b> <b>separations</b> showed that new water (meltwater) inputs to the stream ranged widely from 41 to 74 %, and increased with catchment size (41 to 11 125 ha) (with one exception) and with open land cover (0 – 73 %). Peak dissolved organic carbon concentrations and relative alkalinity dilution in stream water ranked in the same order among catchments as the new water fractions, suggesting that new water followed shallow flow paths. During the 1994 snowmelt, despite similar timing and magnitude of melt inputs, the new-water contribution to stream flow ranged only from 30 to 36 % in the four catchments. We conclude that the uncommonly high and variable new water fractions in streamwater during the 1993 melt were caused by direct runoff of meltwater over frozen ground, which was prevalent in open land areas during the 1993 winter. In a high-intensity summer rainstorm in 1993, new water fractions were smaller relative to the 1993 snowmelt, ranging from 28 to 46 %, but they ranked in the identical catchment order.

In the agricultural watershed (Watershed A), the storm hydrograph is dominated by pre-event water, whereas the mixed land use watershed (Watershed M) storm hydrograph is more event water dominated. Watershed A also contains higher nutrient concentrations, especially nitrate. High bulk precipitation and greater maximum intensity export more nitrate, SRP, and DOC to the streams. Results also indicate nitrate, DOC, and SRP concentrations display distinct temporal patterns during spring storm events. DOC concentration increased with stormflow and peaked on the rising limb/with maximum discharge regardless of land use or storm event. In Watershed A, SRP concentration followed a similar pattern to DOC during small storms; therefore they are believed to be exported together with flushing of saturated near-surface soil waters via macropores/overland flow. However, SRP likely has multiple flowpaths, one dominated over another depending on the storm. Nitrate concentrations matched Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and Na+ trajectories and decreased with stormflow, suggesting a tile drain/subsurface flowpath.

40|$|Environmental {{heterogeneity}} is ubiquitous, but environmental {{systems are}} often analyzed {{as if they}} were homogeneous instead, resulting in aggregation errors that are rarely explored and almost never quantified. Here I use simple benchmark tests to explore this general problem in one specific context: the use of seasonal cycles in chemical or isotopic tracers (such as Cl −, δ 18 O, or δ 2 H) to estimate timescales of storage in catchments. Timescales of catchment storage are typically quantified by the mean transit time, meaning the average time that elapses between parcels of water entering as precipitation and leaving again as streamflow. Longer mean transit times imply greater damping of seasonal tracer cycles. Thus, the amplitudes of tracer cycles in precipitation and streamflow are commonly used to calculate catchment mean transit times. Here I show that these calculations will typically be wrong by several hundred percent, when applied to catchments with realistic degrees of spatial heterogeneity. This aggregation bias arises from the strong nonlinearity in the relationship between tracer cycle amplitude and mean travel time. I propose an alternative storage metric, the young water fraction in streamflow, defined as the fraction of runoff with transit times of less than roughly 0. 2  years. I show that this young water fraction (not to be confused with event-based "new water" in <b>hydrograph</b> <b>separations)</b> is accurately predicted by seasonal tracer cycles within a precision of a few percent, across the entire range of mean transit times from almost zero to almost infinity. Importantly, this relationship is also virtually free from aggregation error. That is, seasonal tracer cycles also accurately predict the young water fraction in runoff from highly heterogeneous mixtures of subcatchments with strongly contrasting transit-time distributions. Thus, although tracer cycle amplitudes yield biased and unreliable estimates of catchment mean travel times in heterogeneous catchments, they can be used to reliably estimate the fraction of young water in runoff...|$|R
40|$|Hydrological {{processes}} in small catchments {{are not quite}} understood yet, which is true in particular for catchments in data scarce, semi-arid regions. This is {{in contrast with the}} need for a better understanding of water fluxes and the interactions between surface- and groundwater in order to facilitate sustainable water resources management in such environments, where both floods and droughts can result in severe crop loss. In this study, event runoff coefficient analysis and limited tracer data of four small, nested sub-catchments (0. 4 – 25. 3 km 2 ) in a data scarce, semi-arid region of Tanzania helped to characterize the distinct response of the study catchments and to gain insights into the dominant runoff processes. The estimated event runoff coefficients were very low and did not exceed 0. 09. They were found to be significantly related to the 5 -day antecedent precipitation totals as well as to base flow, indicating a close relation to changes in soil moisture and thus potential switches in runoff generation processes. The time scales of the "direct flow" reservoirs, used to compute the event runoff coefficients, were up to one order of magnitude reduced for extreme events, compared to "average" events, suggesting the activation of at least a third flow component, besides base- and direct flow, assumed to be infiltration overland flow. Analysis of multiple tracers highlighted the importance of pre-event water to total runoff, even during intense and high yield precipitation events. It further illustrated the distinct nature of the catchments, in particular with respect to the available water storage, which was suggested by different degrees of tracer damping in the individual streams. The use of multiple tracers subsequently allowed estimating uncertainties in <b>hydrograph</b> <b>separations</b> arising from the use of different tracers. The results highlight the presence of considerable uncertainties, emphasizing the need for multiple tracers in order to avoid misleading results. This study shows the value of hydrological data collection over one whole wet season using multi-tracers to improve the understanding of hydrological functioning and thus for water resources management in data scarce, semi-arid environments...|$|R

The growth of food, fuel, feed, and fiber crops on agricultural land requires additions of nitrogen fertilizer to bolster crop yields. The portion of applied nitrogen {{that is not}} utilized by the crops is highly susceptible to transport to nearby streams. Elevated nitrogen concentrations in streams can lead to water quality concerns such as ecosystem degradation or drinking water contamination. Identification of geospatial, environmental, and watershed characteristics (variables) that are correlated with nitrogen concentration in streams will provide {{a greater understanding of}} the influence that certain variables have on nitrogen transport to streams. The route through which water travels from the landscape to streams (flowpath) is one of these variables. Movement of many forms of nitrogen is linked to the movement of water, therefore, understanding the fluxes of water to streams will help to expand the understanding of nitrogen transport and the affect that landscape management changes will have on the concentrations of nitrogen in streams. 	In some areas, groundwater is an important flowpath for delivering water and nitrogen to streams. <b>Hydrograph</b> <b>separation</b> can be used to estimate the amount of total streamflow that is attributable to slowflow sources (flowpaths through which water moves slowly) such as groundwater, and fastflow sources (flowpaths through which water moves quickly) such as overland flow. Because flowpaths have an impact on water and nitrogen transport to streams, testing and improving <b>hydrograph</b> <b>separation</b> techniques is needed. Two independent methods of <b>hydrograph</b> <b>separation,</b> the graphical-based BFI program and chemical tracer-based end-member mixing analysis (EMMA), were used to estimate slowflow contributions to the same streams. The estimates of slowflow from the two separate methods of <b>hydrograph</b> <b>separation</b> were not identical, highlighting the differences in how each method works and the difficulty of accurately estimating slowflow. A modified method of EMMA, referred to as a ratio-based EMMA, was created and tested using synthetic and real stream data. The ratio-based EMMA represents a new method of <b>hydrograph</b> <b>separation,</b> as it produced reasonably accurate slowflow estimates when tested against synthetic and real stream data. The importance of flowpath was then tested in six highly modified streams in agricultural watersheds that had extensive data sets and well understood hydrology. The importance of flowpath on stream nitrogen concentrations in these streams aligned with expectations based on what is currently known. Finally, this study was expanded to a large number of small streams where statistical methods were used to gain broader understanding of the controls on water and nitrogen movement to streams, and to allow for extrapolation of this information to unstudied streams. 	 In addition to flowpath, a small number of geospatial, environmental, and watershed variables were shown to be important for estimating total nitrogen loads and concentrations in a large number of small streams. These variables were used in the development of several multiple linear regression models, many of which performed well when applied to a set of validation streams, having reasonable high R 2 values and low normalized root mean squared errors. 	Determination of the important flowpath(s) as well as other important variables which increase nitrogen movement to streams will allow watershed managers to more accurately implement beneficial land management practices in an effort to reduce nitrogen movement to streams. This knowledge will become increasingly important in an effort to maintain or reduce the amount of nitrogen in streams while increasing crop production to support the rising global population...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{large-scale}} flood {{events in}} Iowa demonstrate {{a need to}} understand how drainage alteration, specifically through tile drainage and ditches related to intensive agriculture, affect peak flow events and streamflow hydrology. This research tested the hypothesis that there is a relationship between tile drainage and peak flow events, specifically that tile drainage increases the occurrence of peak flow events. The first objective was to implement a physically based, coupled surface water/groundwater model (HydroGeoSphere - HGS) in the South Fork watershed in north-central Iowa. The second objective was to sample and analyze precipitation, surface water, groundwater, and tile water for stable isotopes from August 2011 to July 2013 in order to implement and model isotopic <b>hydrograph</b> <b>separation</b> during a peak flow event. The intent of that work was to delineate the source of water in the flood. Due to the inability of the HGS model to converge, the model was abandoned and efforts were refocused on using stable isotopes to predict water sources during peak flow events. The drought of 2012 provided an opportunity to investigate how tiles interact with other hydrologic components during a hydrologic extreme. Results suggest that tile drainage water [...] which is often a mixture of surface intakes water, saturated macropore flow, and groundwater [...] was fed exclusively by groundwater during the drought. In contrast, tile water is a combination of these sources under normal hydrologic conditions. During a precipitation and flood event in late May 2013 water pooled around surface intakes, stream discharge reached two-year peaks, and the tile water isotopic composition moved significantly away from groundwater towards the composition of precipitation. These results suggest that surface runoff to the tiles would be the dominant component fed to streams during peak flow, and that isotopic <b>hydrograph</b> <b>separation</b> may prove useful when peak flow occurs again. Although HGS was not useful for simulating peak flow and <b>hydrograph</b> <b>separation</b> in this research, it will be a useful tool, along with stable isotopes, to continue investigations of this type in the future...|$|E

40|$|Detecting, {{quantifying}} {{and understanding}} groundwater discharge to streams are {{crucial for the}} assessment of water, nutrient and contaminant exchange at the groundwater–surface water interface. In lowland agricultural catchments with significant groundwater discharge this is of particular importance because of the risk of excess leaching of nutrients to streams. Here we aim to combine hydraulic and tracer methods from point-to-catchment scale to assess the temporal and spatial variability of groundwater discharge in a lowland, groundwater gaining stream in Denmark. At the point-scale, groundwater fluxes to the stream were quantified based on vertical streambed temperature profiles (VTPs). At the reach scale (0. 15 – 2 km), the spatial distribution of zones of focused groundwater discharge was investigated by the use of distributed temperature sensing (DTS). Groundwater discharge to the stream was quantified using differential gauging with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). At the catchment scale (26 – 114 km 2), runoff sources during main rain events were investigated by <b>hydrograph</b> <b>separations</b> based on electrical conductivity (EC) and stable isotopes 2 H/ 1 H. Clear differences in runoff sources between catchments were detected, ranging from approximately 65 % event water for the most responsive sub-catchment to less than 10 % event water for the least responsive sub-catchment. This was supported by the groundwater head gradients, where the location of weaker gradients correlated with a stronger response to precipitation events. This shows a large variability in groundwater discharge to the stream, despite the similar lowland characteristics of sub-catchments indicating the usefulness of environmental tracers for obtaining information about integrated catchment functioning during precipitation events. There were also clear spatial patterns of focused groundwater discharge detected by the DTS and ADCP measurements at the reach scale indicating high spatial variability, where a significant part of groundwater discharge was concentrated in few zones indicating the possibility of concentrated nutrient or pollutant transport zones from nearby agricultural fields. VTP measurements confirmed high groundwater fluxes in discharge areas indicated by DTS and ADCP, and this coupling of ADCP, DTS and VTP proposes a novel field methodology to detect areas of concentrated groundwater discharge with higher resolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of climate and antecedent moisture conditions on hydrological and biogeochemical fluxes was studied and contrasted in three nested, high-elevation, snowmelt-dominated catchments in the Sierra Nevada, California and one basin-floor, semi-arid catchment in southeastern Arizona. Investigations were completed within a different two-year period at each site, {{with the second}} year being climatically different (typically drier) than the first. Spring snowmelt, widespread winter frontal precipitation, and episodic summer rains induce surface water flow in these catchments, though the timing and magnitude of nutrient redistribution among soil and stream compartments varies in each. Surface water flow from spring snowmelt in high-elevation catchments travels through the subsurface or across the surface as direct runoff A more typical process producing surface water flow in semi-arid catchments is flooding during episodic or widespread rainfall. <b>Hydrograph</b> <b>separations</b> at Emerald Lake, Topaz Lake and Marble Fork catchments in Sequoia National Park, California, revealed {{that the majority of}} snowmelt flowed through soil before entering the stream in both average and highsnow years. The Emerald Lake watershed had a higher fraction of old water in its outflow in the average accumulation year because of the previous year's high accumulation and longer melt season. A mixing model analysis performed of the upper San Pedro River, Arizona, for wet and dry years showed that summer flood hydrographs were composed mainly of precipitation and surface runoff in both years, though a higher soil-water input occurred in the wetter year and in early season floods in the dry year. Stream and soil water nitrate concentrations were higher during floods in the dry year. Early season floods in the dry year exhibited more variability in stream water nitrate and sulfate, whereas late season flood concentrations reflected a well-mixed system and therefore less variation of these species during flood hydrographs. These data showed that periods of below average precipitation preceding major runoff periods result both in less soil water and solute export during summer floods in basin-floor catchments and less direct snowmelt in high-elevation catchments. Hydrologic and solute export in each catchment, despite their differing geographical locations, responds in similar ways to climate variability...|$|R
40|$|The {{calculation}} of loss is vital for design flood estimation models {{and in order to}} estimate continuing loss (CL), proportional loss (PL) and volumetric runoff coefficient, the surface runoff has to be separated from the total given in a stream flow hydrograph. To obtain the volume of surface runoff from the streamflow <b>hydrograph,</b> baseflow <b>separation</b> becomes necessary and in this paper a few base flow separation methods are explored and an appropriate method selected to assess to impact of baseflow on loss estimates. The process of separation requires a base flow separation coefficient and this coefficient (&# 945;) is selected from individual study catchments from 3 to 5 rainfall streamflow events of the same catchments based on sensitivity analysis. The selected &# 945; value of individual catchments is then applied to other rainfall streamflow events of a given catchment. It has been observed that a small degree of error in the selection of &# 945; value does not seem to affect the estimates of the CL, PL or runoff coefficient. Hence, the more practical base flow separation method used in this paper may be applied to other rural catchments for baseflow separation in design loss studies...|$|R
