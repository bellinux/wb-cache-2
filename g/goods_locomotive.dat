25|$|The Victorian Railways X {{class was}} a {{mainline}} <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive</b> of the 2-8-2 'Mikado' type {{operated by the}} Victorian Railways (VR) between 1929 and 1960. They were the most powerful <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive</b> on the VR, aside from the single H class, H220, which was confined to the North East line, until the advent of diesel-electric traction, and operated over the key Bendigo, Wodonga, and Gippsland mainlines.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} that Harold Clapp took over, the VR <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive</b> fleet was almost {{completely}} of 19th century designs that were largely obsolete. Clapp set about modernising the fleet, firstly with construction commencing in 1921 of 25 further examples of the prototype C class heavy <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive</b> of 1918, as well as introducing three new classes of locomotive which proved to be of highly successful design, the K class and N class light-lines locomotives of 1922 and 1925, and the X class heavy <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive</b> of 1929. With a large fleet of relatively new A2 class locomotives available, there was far less development of new passenger locomotives during the Clapp era. Even so, the two classes that were ordered during his time (the 3-cylinder S and H classes) were of unprecedented size, power and technical innovation.|$|E
25|$|Although {{originally}} {{designed as a}} <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive,</b> their maximum permissible speed {{was raised in the}} 1950s from 45 to 50mph (72 to 80km/h) for branchline passenger service, further increasing their versatility.|$|E

50|$|The GWR 388 {{class was}} a large class of 310 0-6-0 <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives</b> built by the Great Western Railway. They are {{sometimes}} referred to as the Armstrong Goods or Armstrong Standard Goods to differentiate from the Gooch Goods and Dean Goods classes, both of which were also large classes of standard <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a 1st class of {{standard}} <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives</b> (SG1).|$|R
25|$|In 1929, C5 {{also became}} the first VR {{locomotive}} to be fitted with a cross-compound air compressor, which was also subsequently adopted across other VR locomotive classes. The C class {{was also the first}} <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive</b> to be fitted with Automatic Staff Exchange apparatus, given their frequent used on express goods and fruit services.|$|E
25|$|The C {{class was}} a {{mainline}} <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive</b> of the 2-8-0 'Consolidation' type that {{ran on the}} Victorian Railways between 1918 and 1962. Although its original design had some key shortcomings, a number of improvements were made over the class' long career on the VR, {{many of which were}} subsequently applied to other locomotive classes on the system.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, C class heavy <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive</b> C 5 was {{equipped}} with a new front end, based on the Association of American Railroads (AAR) design of self-cleaning smokebox, to improve steaming qualities. The results were very promising, and in 1934 A2 998 was selected {{for a series of}} further tests aimed at further front end improvement, conducted under the direction of VR Rolling Stock branch engineer, Edgar Brownbill.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the success}} of the {{superheating}} the DD boiler, it was still somewhat limited in steam raising capabilities. In 1922, a new design of 2-8-0 branch line <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive,</b> the K class was introduced, with noticeably superior boiler performance to that of the DD. In 1929, a DD class locomotive was rebuilt with a larger boiler derived from the K class design. Based on {{the success of}} the rebuild, a further 93 D1or D2 class locomotives were converted between 1929 and 1947.|$|E
25|$|With their {{comparatively}} high {{tractive effort}} (the Walschaerts A2 {{had a higher}} nominal tractive effort than any other VR locomotive, regardless of type, until {{the introduction of the}} C class 2-8-0 of 1918) they also saw widespread use as a fast <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive,</b> particularly in their later life. It was reported as normal practice as early as the 1920s for A2 class locomotives requiring adjustment to axle boxes (axleboxes) and other moving parts to be swapped from passenger to lower-speed freight service to extract greater work from them between overhauls.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Chief Mechanical Engineer W. M. Shannon, the C {{class was}} the first <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{designed}} and built entirely in-house by the Victorian Railways Newport Workshops, following on from the successful Dd and A2 class passenger locomotives. When class leader C1 was introduced in 1918, it was the heaviest and most powerful steam locomotive in Australia. It had been necessary for Victorian Railways to strengthen bridges at Dudley Street, North Melbourne and along the lines to Woodend and Seymour on which the new locomotive was expected to run.|$|E
25|$|In 1894 Jones {{introduced}} his 4-6-0 <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives,</b> the first with this wheel arrangement on British railways. Fifteen locomotives were built by Sharp, Steward & Co., and ran with six-wheeled tenders. One of these, No. 103, is a static {{exhibit at the}} Riverside Museum in Glasgow. Fifteen large 4-4-0s, the 'Loch' Class, arrived from Dübs & Co. in 1896, and these had identical tenders to the <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other {{locomotives}} {{were used}} {{including members of}} the Fire Fly, Leo, and Sun classes, and also Hercules class <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
50|$|Locomotives of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway were {{originally}} painted dark green with ornate brass work and copper capped chimneys. Lining {{was black and}} white. In 1876 the dark green was changed to a light green and goods engines were painted plain black. 1878 saw the <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives</b> also appearing in light green. This livery was discontinued from 1883 when all locomotives were painted black. Lining was red and white for passenger locomotives and, if present, red only for <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
25|$|Upon introduction, the two steeple-cab {{locomotives}} {{proved the}} superiority of electric traction. They were able to operate together with multiple-unit train control, allowing a single crew to control both as an articulated locomotive with greater tractive effort than the Victorian Railways C class heavy <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive,</b> the most powerful locomotive on the VR at the time. Based on their success, suburban goods sidings were rapidly electrified and most suburban goods traffic utilised electric traction. With the electrification of the Gippsland line as far as Traralgon in the 1950s, {{the range of the}} E class locomotives was similarly extended and they could be found shunting or hauling services along the line.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{retired in}} 1896, after an {{accident}} testing a locomotive. He {{was replaced by}} Peter Drummond, who had worked at LB, North British and Caledonian Railways before joining the Highland. The first locomotives designed by Drummond were the 'Small Bens' that closely followed locomotive design on the NBR and CR. A total of 20 were built by Dübs & Co., Highland Railway at Lochgorm and North British Loco Co. in 1898–1901 and 1906, these were smaller than the Loch Class, and they normally worked on the line north to Wick and Thurso and east to Keith. Drummond designed a 0-6-0 <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive,</b> and twelve were built between 1900 and 1907 by Dübs & Co. and the North British Loco Co. These had boilers and cylinders interchangeable with the 'Small Bens'.|$|E
2500|$|The Locomotive Design Section had {{introduced}} successful mainline and branchline passenger locomotives with the A2 class and Dd class 4-6-0s, and had recently improved mainline goods services with the C class 2-8-0. [...] They now {{turned their attention}} to a requirement for a more powerful branchline <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive,</b> and in 1922 produced a lighter 2-8-0 [...] "Consolidation" [...] locomotive with a [...] axle load and [...] wheelbase, able to run on even the lightest lines on the VR [...] system.|$|E
50|$|Not {{until the}} {{procurement}} programme for the wartime Kriegslokomotiven were new <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives</b> built in large numbers, {{but of course}} now for a very different purpose.|$|R
50|$|Twelve <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives,</b> {{similar to}} the GWR Pyracmon Class, built by the Stothert and Slaughter in 1849 and 1853. The last one was {{withdrawn}} in 1885.|$|R
5000|$|These <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives</b> had 17.5 x 24 in cylinders, 4 ft driving wheels, and a [...] boiler. Eighty-one {{were built}} at Stratford Works between 1893 and 1898.|$|R
2500|$|The X {{class was}} a {{development}} of the earlier C class 2-8-0 <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive,</b> designed to be gauge convertible from [...] to [...] {{in the event of}} the Victorian Railways network being converted to standard gauge. The C class, with a narrow firebox between the frames, could not be easily converted. The X class retained the same cylinder and driving wheel dimensions as the C class as well as its valve gear, but introduced a much larger boiler and a trailing truck behind the rear driving axle.|$|E
2500|$|Once the {{manufacturing}} defects and corrosion damage were corrected, the R class {{proved to be}} a fine locomotive in its intended role of express passenger service, and individual R class locomotives were soon running upwards of [...] each per week. Dynamometer car testing showed they were capable of producing a maximum 1,840 drawbar horsepower (...) at , a significant improvement over the A2's [...] at [...] They quickly took over virtually all mainline passenger services previously operated by the A2 and passenger timetables were revised to take advantage of their higher performance, with cuts to journey times as high as 60 minutes. Although of similar size to the X class 2-8-2 <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive,</b> the R's more modern design features such as larger volume smokebox and better valve events courtesy of larger [...] diameter piston valves with long [...] travel contributed to its significantly higher horsepower output than the 1,400 drawbar horsepower (...) output of the X class.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{intended}} for express passenger use, H220 {{was found to}} be particularly effective when used as a fast <b>goods</b> <b>locomotive.</b> It typically hauled five return trips a week between Melbourne and Wodonga, covering around 1,875 miles (3,017km) per week and hauling loads of up to 820 tons (833 t) over the 1 in 50 gradients of this line. By comparison, the maximum loads of the C class 2-8-0 and X class 2-8-2 heavy goods locomotives between Wodonga and Melbourne were 555 and 650 tons respectively. H220 was also able to complete the journey in a much shorter time, with its large tender requiring only a single stop for water rather than the two stops for water and coal the other locomotives required. Even after the introduction of mainline diesel-electric traction from 1952 onwards, Victorian Railways promotional literature featured H220 prominently. One advertisement in Walkabout in November 1953, headed 'Trains we are proud of', promoted H220 as [...] "Australia's mightiest engine" [...] and its nightly service hauling the 21:25 Albury Interstate Fast Freight.|$|E
25|$|Like other {{primarily}} <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives,</b> British Railways' {{fleet of}} 9Fs also saw extensive passenger service in hauling Saturday 'Holiday Specials', {{especially in the}} North East and Western regions.|$|R
50|$|It {{was noted}} by some Wellington {{locomotive}} drivers that the EO class were <b>good</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{to drive in}} an article for New Zealand Railfan magazine in September 2011.|$|R
25|$|Seven <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives,</b> 2-4-0 with four-wheeled tenders, {{had been}} built in 1858–59 by Hawthorns, and these were {{followed}} in 1862 by two more, slightly larger and with cabs. Two batches of ten 2-4-0 <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives</b> were built in 1863–64 by Sharp, Stewart & Co. These were slightly larger than the previous locomotives; the later ten {{of them had a}} longer wheelbase than the previous ten. Three locomotives survived until 1923. The Highland also took over the Findhorn Railway's small 0-4-0 tank engine that {{had been built}} by Neilson and the 0-4-0 tank engine that had been bought for the Hopeman branch from Hawthorns.|$|R
60|$|The engineer's {{department}} of a railway is one which involves {{some of the}} most important operations connected with the line. But indeed the same may be said of all the departments--passenger, <b>goods,</b> <b>locomotive,</b> and police, each of which is independent, yet connected. They are separate wheels, as it were, which work harmoniously together in one grand system, and the gentlemen at the head of these departments must be men of experience; of acknowledged talent and power, each supreme in his own department, but all subject to the general manager.|$|E

50|$|The six {{examples}} of this class were designed by Patrick Stirling for the GSWR and were built by Kilmarnock Locomotive Works between 1864 and 1866, to replace earlier 0-4-0 <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives</b> inherited by the railway. They were numbered 52-57-. The {{members of the class}} were fitted with weather boards, later replaced by Stirling cabs. The safety valves over the firebox were later replaced by those of Ramsbottom design over the centre of the boiler following a boiler explosion at Springhill in 1876. The class was later perpetuated by Stirling’s brother James Stirling (1835-1917) in his 65 class <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
50|$|The LCDR Acis {{class was}} {{a class of}} {{fourteen}} steam locomotives of the 0-6-0 wheel arrangement. They were designed by William Martley for the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) as <b>goods</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
