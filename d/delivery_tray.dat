40|$|The {{development}} of a spaceflight-rated Porous Tube Insert Module (PTIM) nutrient <b>delivery</b> <b>tray</b> has facilitated {{a series of studies}} evaluating various aspects of water and nutrient delivery to plants as they would be cultivated in space. We report here on our first experiment using the PTIM with a software-driven feedback moisture sensor control strategy for maintaining root zone wetness level set-points. One-day-old wheat seedlings (Tritium aestivum cv Apogee; N= 15) were inserted into each of three Substrate Compartments (SCs) pre-packed with 0. 25 - 1. mm Profile(TradeMark) substrate and maintained at root zone relative water content levels of 70, 80 and 90 %. The SCs contained a bottom-situated porous tube around which a capillary mat was wrapped. Three Porous Tubes. were planted using similar protocols (but without the substrate) and also maintained at these three moisture level set-points. Half-strength modified Hoagland's nutrient solution was used to supply water and nutrients. Results on hardware performance, water usage rates and wheat developmental differences between the different experimental treatments are presented...|$|E
40|$|An {{one year}} {{epidemiological}} study {{was carried out}} between February 2005 and January 2006 in Belgium to assess the Campylobacter prevalence in free-range broiler production. Three successive broiler flocks on 6 belgian farms were investigated {{for the presence of}} Campylobacter ssp. during the rearing period. Each flock was visited four times, before and after the outdoor rearing period. During each visit, samples were taken in the broiler houses (litter, cecal droppings, water-lines, feed, entrance premises) {{as well as from the}} outer rearing environment (open-air range). Conventional microbiological methods combined with biochemical tests were used for the Campylobacter detection, species identification and isolation. Campylobacter prevalence was very high in free-range broiler production during the experimental period. C. jejuni is the main species isolated from all contaminated samples, while mixed C. jejuni/C. coli infections sometimes occured. Contamination of the broiler flocks was increased in summer/autumn, with a 100 % flocks contamination, whereas only 4 (66. 7 %) and 3 (50 %) of the flocks became Campylobacter positive in spring and winter respectively, at the end of the rearing period. Moreover, about 53. 8 % of contaminated flocks were infected with Campylobacter before chicks have access to the open-air range. In 69. 2 % of the Campylobacter-positive flocks, the open-air range soil belonged partly of fully to environmental samples found to be Campylobacter-positive before flock infection. The other potential sources of infection were <b>delivery</b> <b>tray,</b> entrance premises floor and water-lines. The access to an open-air range seems to be an important way of contamination of broilers because Campylobacter prevalence in the flocks increased after going out...|$|E
40|$|A {{one year}} {{epidemiological}} study {{was carried out}} between February 2005 and February 2006 {{in the southern part}} of Belgium to assess the Campylobacter prevalence in free-range broiler production. Three successive broiler flocks from six Belgian farms were investigated for the presence of Campylobacter spp. during the rearing period. Each flock was visited four times, before and after the outdoor rearing period. During each visit, samples were taken in the broiler house (litter, cecal droppings, water-lines, feed, anteroom) as well as from the outer rearing environment (open-air range). The Campylobacter detection in all samples was carried out according to the ISO 10272 standard. Identification was based on colonial morphology, microscopic examination, and biochemical tests. PCR multiplex was used for genetic confirmation. Campylobacter jejuni was the main species isolated from all contaminated samples. Overall, mixed infections C. jejuni / Campylobacter coli represented 40. 6 %, while C. jejuni and C. coli represented 46. 9 % and 12. 5 % of chicken samples respectively. A 100 % flock contamination was observed in the 6 farms during the summer-autumn period, whereas only 66. 7 % and 33. 3 % of the flocks became Campylobacter-positive in spring and winter respectively, at the end of the rearing period. Half of contaminated flocks were infected before chickens have access to the open-air range. Environmental samples, especially the open-air range soil, were found to be Campylobacter-positive before flock infection. The other potential sources of contamination were <b>delivery</b> <b>tray,</b> anteroom floor and water-lines. Other animal productions like cattle on the farm, no applied rodent control, no cleaning and disinfection of water-lines between flocks, no detergent used for cleaning and thinning were recorded as risk factors. In conclusion, the contact with the environment, particularly the access to an open-air range, appeared to be the major way of Campylobacter contamination of chickens in free-range broiler production...|$|E

40|$|Presented at Society of Hospital Medicine, 05 / 13 / 2011, Dallas, TX. Background: We {{investigated}} the timing {{problems associated with}} insulin administration, blood glucose (BG) monitoring and meal <b>tray</b> <b>delivery</b> on a sub-acute medical surgical unit in the only Academic Medical Center, Level 1 Trauma Center {{in the state of}} New Mexico. It was noted that BG monitoring did not coincide with meal delivery. Insulin administration was not coordinated with meal delivery and or BG monitoring and often would occur greater than 30 minutes after the delivery of the meal tray. There were no protocols in place for standards of practice regarding BG timing and insulin administration. We believed these process discrepancies were resulting in worse BG outcomes. Objective: The primary objective was to evaluate the timing of our current in-patient process between BG monitoring, insulin administration and bedside meal delivery. A second objective was to create workflows that would allow for this process to be completed within a 30 minute window. Third objective was to create protocols to guide staff with the most current evidence based practice. Method: This was a quality improvement workflow project on an adult inpatient unit where approximately one-third of patients receive insulin. We used time-in-motion studies and process mapping to quantitate and define our current process and to assist in creating effective interventions. We designed and instituted interventions including standardization of processes and meal delivery times. We developed a standardized nursing protocol for insulin delivery and BG monitoring. In the last stage we instituted nurse driven processes including glucose monitoring, meal delivery, and insulin administration. Process and outcomes measures were collected over one year. Results: We found a number of discrepancies with BG timing, meal <b>tray</b> <b>delivery</b> and insulin administration. Staff obtained BGs > 30 minutes prior to meal 49 % of the time, ranging from 166 minutes before meal to 98 minutes after meal. Meal timing was inconsistent; delivery to floor varied by 15 - 30 minutes each day, followed by tray audits taking â‰¥ 15 minutes on average. Outcomes measures for these same time periods showed a decrease in mean BG from 160. 40 to 150. 64. Other significant results shown in graphics to righ...|$|R
40|$|At Valley Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, the {{economic}} recession is as visible as {{anywhere else in}} the United States. A lack of paying patients equates to forced reductions in labor and increased productivity metric mandates. In the foodservice area, antiquated technology limits productivity in conducting tray line food service <b>delivery.</b> A new <b>tray</b> line system would need to be considerably faster while using less employees and moving parts to maximize efficiency, effectively doing much more with far less. There are two main systems of food service as part of the patient experience; tray line and room service. Both systems have their benefits and individual costs coupled with necessary labor. Room service is much more labor and cost intensive but typically yields the all important higher patient satisfaction scores while the majority of hospitals employ the tray line system. Using empirical research, this paper will explore variations to tray line setup, personnel and equipment usage to find a better way to conduct business at Valley Hospital. This paper will investigate comparable undertakings through trade journals and peer reviewed papers along with information from interviews with peer contacts in health care food service to aide in the creation of this new method...|$|R
40|$|The {{patient and}} family voice should {{be heard in}} the {{healthcare}} setting. Gaining knowledge and insight from a parent of a pediatric patient will allow hospital staff and administrators to see the hospital experience {{from the vantage point of}} a patient and family member (Uhl, Fisher, Docherty, 2 Ì† 6 Brandon, 2013). It is important to continually review feedback and suggestions from families of pediatric patients to improve the care of future patients. Ultimately, this will improve patient satisfaction scores, but most importantly, it will improve the experience of pediatric patients (Creating patient and family advisory councils, 2010). The investigator interviewed ten families of patients on the pediatric unit and received feedback on things that are going well, opportunities for improvement, and suggestions for improving the patient experience. Overall, nursing care was highlighted as a positive aspect of the patientâ€™s hospitalization. Opportunities for improvement noted were the meal <b>tray</b> <b>delivery</b> process, communication between surgical services and parents of pediatric patients, and the focus of pediatric patients in the Emergency Department. Suggestions and ideas expressed by the patientsâ€™ parents were focused on physical environment improvements, emotional support, and amenities to improve the hospitalization. By asking families about their experiences, changes can be made to enhance how care is delivered, services offered, or amenities provided for future patients. Results from the interviews will be shared with the Family Advisory Council (FAC) for Jeff Gordon Childrenâ€™s Hospital, staff, and administrators in order for action plans to be developed and implemented...|$|R

The efficacy and safety of peroxide-based teeth whitening has been a largely contested issue over the last two decades. Several reviews have been written on the subject, but the current literature lacks a more involved description of the key factors that influence whitening effects and the manifestation of its adverse effects. Thus, a review of these key factors should be able to more clearly define how these influence treatment outcome during peroxide-based teeth whitening treatments, and how these treatments are likely to expose individuals to additional risk factors. Based on evidence in the current literature, whitening efficacies are dependent on a series of variables associated with treatment. Of these variables, the ones more directly associated with the whitening effects produced after treatment are peroxide concentration, active bleaching time, and [...] to some extent [...] the choice between currently available <b>delivery</b> systems (<b>trays,</b> strips, application brushes). From the studies reviewed, higher concentrations of peroxide produce more pronounced whitening effects, while lower concentrations needing longer active bleaching times to produce similar color changes, as measured by either VITA shade guides, or the CIEL*a*b* system. Color relegations are likely to occur with treatments composed of lower number of treatment sessions compared to treatments with multiple sessions. In terms of adverse effects, peroxides have been found to potentially be associated with carcinogenicity and cytotoxicity not only in oral tissues but in the gastrointestinal lining of hamsters and rats during in vivo studies. However, current reviews and studies have highlighted that excessive levels of peroxide exposure are needed to promote tumor growth or induce cytotoxic effects in the oral cavity; thus, it is unlikely that teeth whitening use of peroxides exposes individuals to dangerous levels of carcinogenicity and cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, some studies have found a decrease in odontoblast viability at concentrations of 16 % carbamide peroxide, suggesting cytotoxicity may become a more significant factor at carbamide peroxide concentrations higher than 16 %. Tooth and gingival sensitivity was closely {{associated with the use of}} either higher peroxide concentrations or longer active bleaching times. However, desensitizing agents such as fluoride, potassium nitrate, and amorphous calcium-phosphate have been found to effectively reduce this sensitivity of teeth and gingival tissues in people experiencing tissue sensitivity. Structural damage to enamel and dentin were found to be statistically insignificant in the studies reviewed, with whitening products of low acidity causing the bulk of the observed demineralization in in vitro studies. In vivo studies evaluating peroxide-associated demineralization have suggested that salivary components are capable of fully remineralizing any affected teeth structures following peroxide-based teeth whitening. In conclusion, from the studies analyzed, it is advisable to use concentrations lower than 16 % carbamide peroxide during at-home treatments. However, use of higher concentrations are acceptable if provided under professional supervision. People with gingival recessions are more likely to experience sensitivity, so use of desensitizing agents at the time of treatment is advisable. In terms of whitening pastes, whitening gels of relatively neutral pH should be used (pH between 5 and 7) to reduce enamel and dentin demineralization; additives may include desensitizing agents to help with sensitivity and antioxidants which can counteract the oxidative stress of peroxides on oral tissues...|$|R
