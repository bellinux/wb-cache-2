50|$|The {{brake drum}} is {{generally}} {{made of a}} special type of cast iron that is <b>heat-conductive</b> and wear-resistant. It rotates with the wheel and axle. When a driver applies the brakes, the lining pushes radially against the inner surface of the drum, and the ensuing friction slows or stops rotation of the wheel and axle, and thus the vehicle. This friction generates substantial heat.|$|E

They prevent the {{propagation}} of flame from the exposed side of the unit to the protected side {{by the use of}} metal matrix creating a torturous path called a flame cell or element. All detonation flame arresters operate on the same principle: removing heat from the flame as it attempts to travel through narrow passages with walls of metal or other <b>heat-conductive</b> material, but unlike flame arresters, detonation flame arresters must be built to withstand extreme pressures that travel at supersonic velocities, [...] at 2500 m/s is not uncommon with a group D Gas.|$|E
50|$|A <b>heat-conductive</b> surface, such as {{porcelain}} or metal, {{is heated}} to a temperature that will induce a nociceptive response in an animal subject - normally 50-56 °C. The subject is then placed {{onto the surface}} and prevented from leaving the platform by blockades. The latency to pain-reflex behavior is measured. One complication of this assay is its unsuitability for repeated testing. Animals that {{have been subjected to}} the hot-plate test in the past display a behavioral tolerance phenomenon, which is characterized by decreased latencies and reduced sensitivities to antinociceptive agents. Another complication of the hot-plate test is determining what constitutes a behavioral pain response; is it the lifting/licking of paws, vocalization, attempting to climb out of the cylinder, etc. Also, delivering the heat stimulus in a controlled fashion presents difficulties due to each section having varying temperatures based upon surface area exposure and whether the animal is moving or not.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sleeping}} pads's warmth {{is characterized}} by R-value. But unlike sleeping bags' EN 13537 test standard and widely accepted recommendations, sleeping pad R-values lacks a simple mapping and label for 'how much warmth' a consumer should expect. Combining various standards and various authors' research, an approximate R-value to temperature chart follows: Same as EN 13537, a [...] "standard man" [...] {{is assumed to be}} 25 years old, with a height of 1.73 m and a weight of 73 kg; a [...] "standard woman" [...] is assumed to be 25 years old, with a height of 1.60 m and a weight of 60 kg. The sleeping bag and pad system (above, below, and sides) should provide the same insulation value all around a person, but cost, size, weight, comfort, and lack-of-knowledge often lead persons to reduce the R-value to below their personal 'recommended R-value'. Since the pad and bag work together, a 'warmer' bag can compensate the a 'thin' pad and a 'thick pad' for a 'cold' bag. Highly <b>heat-conductive</b> surfaces (e.g. concrete, granite) [...] require more insulation for the same temperature than insulating ground surfaces (e.g.snow, dry moss, loose soil, wood, etc.). More heat is lost downward when sleeping on one's stomach vs sleeping one's side (due to reduced contact area and cooler body parts in contact). Most persons can 'feel the cold ground' at approximately half the 'recommended R-values'.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Viscous {{profiles}} of shock waves in systems of conservation laws {{can be viewed}} as heteroclinic orbits in associated systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE). In the case of overcompressive shock waves, these orbits occur in multi-parameter families. We propose a numerical method to compute families of heteroclinic orbits in general systems of ODE. The key point is a special parameterization of the heteroclinic manifold which can be understood as a generalized phase condition; in the case of shock profiles, this phase condition has a natural interpretation regarding their stability. We prove that our method converges and present numerical results for several systems of conservation laws. These examples include traveling waves for the Navier-Stokes equations for compressible viscous, <b>heat-conductive</b> fluids and for the magnetohydrodynamics equations for viscous, <b>heat-conductive,</b> electrically resistive fluids that correspond to shock wave solutions of the associated ideal models, i. e., the Euler, resp.

30|$|There is rich {{literature}} {{dealing with}} the theory of steady compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Concerning the global existence of weak solutions to both compressible isentropic fluids and compressible <b>heat-conductive</b> fluids with large force, one can refer to [1 – 10]. We mention here that the studies above {{on the existence of}} weak solutions are all under the condition u·n= 0 on the boundary, i.e., the fluid cannot penetrate the wall. If u·n≠ 0 on some part of the boundary, the existence of stationary weak solutions is essentially an open problem. The existence of strong solutions near equilibrium with different boundary or free boundary value problem also was investigated in [11 – 19], for example, where the linearized system of the Navier-Stokes equations {{can be viewed as a}} perturbation around the Stokes system. Considering the steady compressible fluids with inhomogeneous boundary conditions, the authors in [20 – 23] study the existence and regularity of compressible fluids with inflow boundary conditions in different domains when the Reynolds number is small. When the characteristic set on the boundary satisfies a certain assumption, the authors in [24, 25] can show the well-posedness to both isentropic fluids and <b>heat-conductive</b> fluids containing inflow boundary with small Reynolds number, but not infinitesimally small, and small Mach number.|$|E
30|$|In addition, some {{important}} {{progress has been}} made about free boundary value problems for multi-dimensional compressible viscous Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity coefficients for either barotropic or heat-conducive fluids by many authors; for example, in the case that across the free surface stress tensor is balanced by a constant exterior pressure and/or the surface tension, classical solutions with strictly positive densities in the fluid regions to FBVP for CNS (1.1) with constant viscosity coefficients are proved locally in time for either barotropic flows [23 – 25] or <b>heat-conductive</b> flows [26 – 28]. In the case that across the free surface the stress tensor is balanced by exterior pressure [25], surface tension [29], or both exterior pressure and surface tension [30], respectively, as the initial data is assumed to be near to a non-vacuum equilibrium state, the global existence of classical solutions with small amplitude and positive densities in fluid region to the FBVP for CNS (1.1) with constant viscosity coefficients is obtained. The global existence of classical solutions to FBVP for compressible viscous and <b>heat-conductive</b> fluids is also established with the stress tensor balanced by the exterior pressure and/or surface tension across the free surface; refer to [31, 32] and the references therein.|$|E
