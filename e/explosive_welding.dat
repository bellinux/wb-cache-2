40|$|Microstructural aspects and bonding {{characteristics}} of the <b>explosive</b> <b>welded</b> Ti/Ti, Ti/steel and Ti/Ni clads were investigated mainly by TEM microscopy. It {{was found that the}} bonding interface was composed of layers of metastable phases such as amorphous phases, icosahedral quasicrystal and intermetallic compounds. These metastable phases are formed as a trace of melting followed by subsequent rapid solidification of thin layers of about 200 nm in thickness along the contact surface of both the component materials. It is concluded that the very thin melting layer is responsible for the bonding of explosively welded Ti base clads and especially amorphous phase formed in the bonding interface keeps high bonding strength...|$|R

50|$|The Gurney {{equations}} give {{a result}} that assumes the flyer plate remains intact throughout its acceleration. For some configurations, this is true; <b>explosive</b> <b>welding,</b> for example, uses a thin sheet of explosive to evenly accelerate flat plates of metal and collide them, and the plates remain solid throughout. However, for many configurations where materials are accelerated outwards, the expanding shell fractures due to stretching. When it fractures, it usually breaks into many small fragments due to the combined effects of ongoing expansion of the shell and stress relief waves moving into the material from fracture points.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{prevailing}} bonding {{theory in}} cold spraying {{is attributed to}} [...] "adiabatic shear instability" [...] which occurs at the particle substrate interface at or beyond a certain velocity called critical velocity. When a spherical particle travelling at critical velocity impacts a substrate, a strong pressure field propagates spherically into the particle and substrate {{from the point of}} contact. As a result of this pressure field, a shear load is generated which accelerates the material laterally and causes localized shear straining. The shear loading under critical conditions leads to adiabatic shear instability where thermal softening is locally dominant over work strain and strain rate hardening, which leads to a discontinuous jump in strain and temperature and breakdown of flow stresses. This adiabatic shear instability phenomena results in viscous flow of material at an outward flowing direction with temperatures close to melting temperature of the material. This material jetting is also a known phenomenon in <b>explosive</b> <b>welding</b> of materials.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the influence of explosive ratio and type of sensitizer on the quality of <b>explosive</b> <b>welds</b> between copper and aluminium alloy plates. The welds were performed on a partially overlapping joint configuration using an emulsion explosive (EE) with two different sensitizers, hollow glass microspheres (HGMS) and expanded polystyrene spheres (EPS). Welds with an improved surface were achieved by using the HGMS sensitizer. A higher wave amplitude was registered in welds produced with the EPS sensitizer. In turn, the dimension of the molten pockets was influenced by the explosive ratio, increasing in size with increases in the values of this parameter. The intermetallic content of these zones varied according to the sensitizer type. Unlike the CuAl 2 phase, the Cu-richer phases CuAl and Cu 9 Al 4 were only identified in welds performed using the EPS sensitizer. An increase in hardness was observed at the interface of all welds, which resulted from both the presence of intermetallic phases and the plastic deformation of the materials promoted by the impact. This effect was most evident on the aluminium alloy side. All the welds had a greater strength than copper, i. e. the weakest material of the joint. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

In response to this situation, a status report for the project as of this date, has been prepared and follows. Significant work has been accomplished on three major tasks of this project [...] increasing the circumferential strength of MA 956 tubing, joining of the MA 956 alloy, and determination of the high temperature corrosion limits of the MA 956 alloy.

40|$|The {{status of}} an <b>explosive</b> seam <b>welding</b> process, which was {{developed}} and evaluated {{for a wide range}} of metal joining opportunities, is summarized. The process employs very small quantities of explosive in a ribbon configuration to accelerate a long-length, narrow area of sheet stock into a high-velocity, angular impact against a second sheet. At impact, the oxide films of both surface are broken up and ejected by the closing angle to allow atoms to bond through the sharing of valence electrons. This cold-working process produces joints having parent metal properties, allowing a variety of joints to be fabricated that achieve full strength of the metals employed. Successful joining was accomplished in all aluminum alloys, a wide variety of iron and steel alloys, copper, brass, titanium, tantalum, zirconium, niobium, telerium, and columbium. Safety issues were addressed and are as manageable as many currently accepted joining processes...|$|R

40|$|Against the {{manufacturing}} requirement for both lower lead time and reduced machining time for titanium components, {{a new concept}} was conceived assembling sheet material and other stock into semi finished parts by (<b>explosive)</b> impact <b>welding.</b> It is believed that this concept (which we named SLAM) could be especially beneficial for titanium alloy and nickel alloy. The present investigation centered on the feasibility of this technology for the widely used Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy. Impact process parameters were established and mechanical properties were investigated. In general, static properties were good. Fatigue strength reduced however, although much less so for notched specimens compared to un-notched material. Fatigue crack initiation could be linked to complex features within the (wavy) weld interface associated with the 'first generation' impact welding parameters.

40|$|The main {{material}} properties affecting the explosive weldability {{of a certain}} metal combination are the yield strength, the ductility, the density and the sonic velocity of the two metals.

Recent results on dynamics of X-welding and X-powder compaction are presented and discussed in this paper in the conceptual context of an orderly oscillating detonation wave (DW), a synergetic phenomena observed in detonation of all classes of composite energetic materials, that was discovered in LEDAP in last eight years. Regular instabilities that are induced by oscillating DW, are transmitted through the interface of the impacted materials, causing the local instability and fluctuations in both processes, formation of the interfacial waves (X-welding mechanism) and in an initial phase of powder compaction. Application of high resolution optical probes (spatial resolution 250 µm, temporal resolution 1 ns, 96 independent channels) allowed the simultaneous registration of the oscillating DW in the X-charge and transmission of oscillations, trough the flyer plate, up to the welding zone.

To improve {{understanding}} of <b>explosive</b> <b>welding</b> and relate {{the effect of}} the process variables on the physical parameters, the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method in the LS-DYNA 12. 0 finite element program was adopt to simulate the process of two-layer steel <b>explosive</b> <b>welding.</b> Temperature field near the stagnation point was calculated according to the work-heat transfer theory.
