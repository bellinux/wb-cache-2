5|$|The most noted of Bauer's {{pictures}} are his watercolors, the technique he used when illustrating for books and magazines; he alternated between aquarelle and <b>gouache.</b> When he created illustrations the two mediums were sometimes mixed, since he needed both {{the speed of}} the aquarelle and the contrast and impasto that the <b>gouache</b> provided. These water-soluble, and fast drying, media allowed Bauer to work on his pictures until the last minute before deadline, something he was prone to do.|$|E
5|$|While Lazzell is most {{well known}} for her white-line woodcuts, she also created ceramics, hooked rugs, paintings, and <b>gouache</b> studies. The {{subjects}} of her paintings and prints included landscape scenery and harbor scenes in Provincetown as well as flowers and still lifes. These and her abstract works incorporated elements of both Synthetic and Analytic cubism and frequently comprised arrangements of vibrantly colored geometric shapes. She was among the earliest women artists in the United States {{to work in a}} modernist style.|$|E
25|$|Le Bateau (1954) This <b>gouache</b> {{created a}} minor stir when the MoMA mistakenly {{displayed}} it upside-down for 47 days in 1961.|$|E
25|$|Works on paper, mainly {{depicting}} the artist herself, have appeared at auction since 1997 and garnered up to £46,850 ($75,000), the sale {{price for the}} <b>gouache</b> Deep Blue III (2011), at Christie's London in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Edo Murtić was a {{prominent}} representative of abstract painting. Primarily known for painting in oil, and <b>gouache,</b> he also produced {{a variety of other}} works such as graphic design, ceramics, mosaics, murals, and theatrical set design.|$|E
25|$|By 1950, Kusama was {{depicting}} abstracted natural {{forms in}} watercolor, <b>gouache,</b> and oil, primarily on paper. She began covering surfaces—walls, floors, canvases, and later, household objects and naked assistants—with the polka dots {{that would become}} a trademark of her work.|$|E
25|$|Nadir Afonso {{produced}} mainly {{paintings and}} serigraphs. His preferred materials were acrylic paint on canvas (bigger works), and <b>gouache</b> on paper (smaller works, often studies for bigger works). His best-known and most distinctive {{work is the}} Cities series, each painting usually representing a city {{from anywhere in the}} world.|$|E
25|$|Yellow {{dextrins}} {{are used}} as water-soluble glues in remoistable envelope adhesives and paper tubes, in the mining industry as additives in froth flotation, in the foundry industry as green strength additives in sand casting, as printing thickener for batik resist dyeing, and as binders in <b>gouache</b> paint {{and also in the}} leather industry.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Krasner mostly {{concentrated}} on creating {{works on paper}} with <b>gouache.</b> These works were named either earth, water, seed, or hieroglyphics and often looked similar to a Rorschach test. Some scholars claim that these images were a critique of Greenberg's theory {{about the importance of}} the two-dimensional nature of the canvas.|$|E
25|$|The twenty-three <b>gouache</b> {{paintings}} of the trials of Sacco and Vanzetti communicated the political concerns of his time, rejecting academic prescriptions for subject matter. The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti was exhibited in 1932 and received acclaim from {{both the public and}} critics. This series gave Shahn the confidence to cultivate his personal style, regardless of society’s art standards.|$|E
25|$|The Smoking Rooms: These {{rooms are}} in the wing {{attributed}} to Inigo Jones and John Webb linking to the south front. The cornices and doors are attributed to Jones. The larger of the two rooms contains a set of fifty-five <b>gouache</b> paintings of an equestrian theme painted in 1755. The room is furnished with {{a complete set of}} bureau, cabinets and break-front bookcases made for the room by Thomas Chippendale.|$|E
25|$|The end of {{the eighteenth}} century and the fall of the French monarchy closed the doors on Vallayer-Coster’s still-life ‘era’ and opened them to her new style of florals. It has been argued that this was the {{highlight}} of her career and what she is best known for. However, it has also been argued that the flower paintings were futile to her career. Nevertheless, this collection contained floral studies in oil, watercolor and <b>gouache.</b>|$|E
25|$|Later, Jansen {{opened his}} own galleries, Jacob and Raam, {{but was not}} {{particularly}} successful. When his business went badly, he decided to sign posters of Karel Appel's lithographs and sell them as originals. Later, {{he made his first}} Karel Appel forgery and sold it for 2,600 guilders. Thus encouraged, he sent another forgery to London; auction house sent a photograph to Appel, who stated that it was genuine. The <b>gouache</b> was sold at a record price.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosed with {{abdominal}} {{cancer in}} 1941, Matisse underwent surgery {{that left him}} chair and bed bound. Painting and sculpture had become physical challenges, so he turned to {{a new type of}} medium. With the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or decoupage. He would cut sheets of paper, pre-painted with <b>gouache</b> by his assistants, into shapes of varying colours and sizes, and arrange them to form lively compositions. Initially, these pieces were modest in size, but eventually transformed into murals or room-sized works. The result was a distinct and dimensional complexity—an art form that was not quite painting, but not quite sculpture.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, with Germany’s {{invasion}} of France looming, Miró relocated to Varengeville in Normandy, and on 20 May {{of the following}} year, as Germans invaded Paris, he narrowly fled to Spain (now controlled by Francisco Franco) {{for the duration of}} the Vichy Regime’s rule. In Varengeville, Palma, and Mont-roig, between 1940 and 1941, Miró created the twenty-three <b>gouache</b> series Constellations. Revolving around celestial symbolism, Constellations earned the artist praise from André Breton, who seventeen years later wrote a series of poems, named after and inspired by Miró's series. Features of this work revealed a shifting focus to the subjects of women, birds, and the moon, which would dominate his iconography for much of the rest of his career.|$|E
25|$|Both Ba Nyan and Ba Zaw {{returned}} to Burma in 1930 (Ba Nyan from approximately {{eight years of}} study in London and Ba Zaw from three). It was Ba Nyan, not Ba Zaw, however, who received triumphant accolades in Burma, holding a famous exhibition at the Governor’s House only months after his return. In London Ba Nyan had mastered the arts of oil painting and <b>gouache,</b> while Ba Zaw, who had remained at the Royal College of Art, refined his techniques in watercolor. Ba Nyan began to surprise Burmese painters with his techniques in thick, impasto oil and in gouache; Ba Zaw, on the other hand, left as a watercolorist and returned as one. Thus, the two painters began to divide the Burmese art community into camps, one following the new styles that Ba Nyan was introducing and the other stubbornly sticking to the transparent watercolor techniques that had been introduced at the Burma Art Club {{at least a decade}} earlier and remained the domain of Ba Zaw.|$|E
25|$|He worked {{primarily}} with watercolor early on. He added colored chalk or pastel to add softness to feathers, {{especially those of}} owls and herons. He employed multiple layers of watercoloring, and sometimes used <b>gouache.</b> All species were drawn life size which accounts for the contorted poses of the larger birds as Audubon strove to fit them within the page size. Smaller species were usually placed on branches with berries, fruit, and flowers. He used several birds in a drawing to present all views of anatomy and wings. Larger birds were often placed in their ground habitat or perching on stumps. At times, as with woodpeckers, he combined several species on one page to offer contrasting features. He frequently depicted the birds' nests and eggs, and occasionally natural predators, such as snakes. He usually illustrated male and female variations, and sometimes juveniles. In later drawings, Audubon used assistants to render the habitat for him. In addition to faithful renderings of anatomy, Audubon also employed carefully constructed composition, drama, and slightly exaggerated poses to achieve artistic as well as scientific effects.|$|E
25|$|In 1938–40, American painter John Steuart Curry painted Tragic Prelude (left), a {{mural of}} Brown {{holding a gun}} and a Bible, in the Kansas State Capitol in Topeka. In 1941, Jacob Lawrence {{illustrated}} Brown's life in The Legend of John Brown, a series of 22 <b>gouache</b> paintings. By 1977, these were in such fragile condition {{that they could not}} be displayed, and the Detroit Institute of Arts had to commission Lawrence to recreate the series as silkscreen prints. The result was a limited-edition portfolio of 22 hand-screened prints, published with a poem, John Brown by Robert Hayden, commissioned specifically for the project. Though Brown had been a popular topic for many painters, The Legend of John Brown was the first series to explore his legacy from an African American perspective. Paintings such as Hovenden's The Last Moments of John Brown immortalize an apocryphal story, in which a Black woman offers the condemned Brown her baby to kiss {{on his way to the}} gallows. It was probably a tale invented by journalist James Redpath.|$|E
25|$|Gude's artistic {{career was}} not one marked with drastic change and revolution, but was instead a steady {{progression}} that slowly reacted to general trends in the artistic world. Gude's early works are of idyllic, sun-drenched Norwegian landscapes which present a romantic, yet still realistic view of his country. Around 1860 Gude began painting seascapes and other coastal subjects. Gude had difficulty with figure drawing initially and so collaborated with Adolph Tidemand {{in some of his}} painting, drawing the landscape himself and allowing Tidemand to paint the figures. Later Gude would work specifically on his figures while at Karlsruhe, and so began populating his paintings with them. Gude initially painted primarily with oils in a studio, basing his works on studies he had done earlier in the field. However, as Gude matured as a painter he began to paint en plein air and espoused the merits of doing so to his students. Gude would paint with watercolors later in life as well as <b>gouache</b> {{in an effort to keep}} his art constantly fresh and evolving, and although these were never as well received by the public as his oil paintings, his fellow artists greatly admired them.|$|E

500|$|Another of Gaudí's {{innovations}} {{in the technical}} realm {{was the use of}} a scale model to calculate structures: for the church of the Colònia Güell, he built a 1:10 scale model with a height of [...] in a shed next to the building. There, he set up a model that had strings with small bags full of birdshot hanging from them. On a drawing board that was attached to the ceiling he drew the floor of the church, and he hung the strings (for the catenaries) with the birdshot (for the weight) from the supporting points of the building—columns, intersection of walls. These weights produced a catenary curve in both the arches and vaults. At that point, he took a picture that, when inverted, showed the structure for columns and arches that Gaudí was looking for. Gaudí then painted over these photographs with <b>gouache</b> or pastel. The outline of the church defined, he recorded every single detail of the building: architectural, stylistic and decorative.|$|E
500|$|Animation on The Sorcerer's Apprentice {{began on}} January 21, 1938, when James Algar, the {{director}} of the segment, assigned animator Preston Blair to work on the scene when Mickey Mouse wakes from his dream. Each of the seven hundred members of staff at the time received a synopsis of Goethe's 1797 poem Der Zauberlehrling, and were encouraged to complete a twenty-question form that requested their ideas on what action might take place. Layout artist Tom Codrick created what Dick Huemer described as [...] "brilliantly colored thumbnails" [...] from preliminary storyboard sketches using <b>gouache</b> paints, which featured bolder use of color and lighting than any previous Disney short. Mickey was redesigned by animator Fred Moore who added pupils to his eyes {{for the first time to}} achieve greater ranges of expression. Most of the segment was shot in live action, including a scene where a UCLA athlete was asked to run and jump across one of the studio's sound stages with barrels in the way, which was used for reference when Mickey traverses through water.|$|E
500|$|The cast of South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut {{is mostly}} carried over {{faithfully}} {{from the television}} series. Co-creator Trey Parker voices the characters of Eric Cartman and Stan Marsh, and Satan, Clyde Donovan, Mr. Garrison, Phillip Niles Argyle, Randy Marsh, Mr. Mackey, Ned Gerblanski, the singing voice of Big Gay Al, the speaking voice of Gregory, The Mole, Adolf Hitler, and President Bill Clinton, as well as multiple other background characters. Matt Stone portrays Kyle Broflovski and Kenny McCormick, as well as Saddam Hussein (even though during the end credits it says that he was voiced by himself), Terrance Henry Stoot, Big Gay Al, Jimbo Kearn, Stuart McCormick, Gerald Broflovski, Bill Gates, and additional voices. Mary Kay Bergman voices Wendy Testaburger, the core mothers of the film (Sheila Broflovski, Sharon Marsh, Liane Cartman, and Carol McCormick), Shelley Marsh, and the clitoris. Isaac Hayes reprised his role from the series as Chef, and voice clips of staff children Jesse Howell, Anthony Cross-Thomas, and Franchesca Clifford make up Ike Broflovski. Guest voices for the film included George Clooney as Dr. <b>Gouache,</b> Brent Spiner as Conan O'Brien, Minnie Driver as Brooke Shields, Eric Idle as Dr. Vosnocker, and Dave Foley provides the combined voices of Alec, Billy, Daniel, and Stephen Baldwin.|$|E
