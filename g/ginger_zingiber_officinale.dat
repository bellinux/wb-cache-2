In reaction with proline-containing peptides GP 2 shows preference for Pro in the P 2 position, and at least 10 -fold higher efficiency of hydrolysis than papain. Comparison of models of GP 2 and GP 3 with the crystal structure of papain shows that the three enzymes have different S 2 pocket structures. The S 2 pocket in GP 2 and GP 3 is half the size of that of papain. GP 2 is the only reported plant cysteine protease with a demonstrated ability to hydrolyse native collagen. The results support a role for ginger proteases as an alternative to papain, in commercial applications such as meat tenderization, where collagen is the target substrate.
