40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} provide recent {{data on the}} {{occurrence}} of non-strongyle intestinal parasite infestation in horses in the Riyadh region of Saudi Arabia {{as a basis for}} developing parasite control strategies. We conducted necropsy for 45 horses from September 2006 to November 2007 in the Riyadh region, Saudi Arabia. 39 out of 45 horses were infected with intestinal parasites with an infestation rate of 86. 6 %. Infestations with seven nematode species and two species of Gasterophilus larva were found. The most prevalent parasites were Strongyloides westeri (64. 4 %) and Parascaris equorum (28. 8 %) followed by Habronema muscae (22. 2 %). Trichostrongylus axei and Oxyuris equi were less common at (11. 1 %) and (8. 8 %), respectively. Habronema megastoma and Setaria equine were found in two horses only (4. 4 %). <b>Gasterophilus</b> <b>intestinalis</b> <b>larvae</b> were recovered from 39 horses (86. 6 %) and Gasterophilus nasalis larvae were found in 17 horses (37. 7 %). Season had a significant effect on the prevalence of P. equorum and G. nasalis, while age of horses had a significant effect only on the prevalence of P. equorum.

40|$|Abstract. An adult {{quarter horse}} mare was {{presented}} with acute colic and fever. Physical examination and abdominocentesis showed septic peritonitis, and the mare was euthanatized. Necropsy and histopathologic ex-amination revealed a focal partial perforation of the right ventral colon, which contained a single bot fly larva, identified as a third-instar <b>larva</b> of <b>Gasterophilus</b> <b>intestinalis.</b> This <b>larva</b> was embedded deep within the mus-cularis and the submucosa. Although bot fly larvae are known to attach to aberrant sites within the digestive tract, {{this is the first}} known report of deep penetration of the colon by a gasterophilus larva, with the resulting leakage of intestinal content leading to septic peritonitis. Key words: Aberrant migration; colic; Gasterophilus; horses; parasite; peritonitis. Bot fly larvae of the genus Gasterophilus commonly in-fect horses throughout the world. The second- and third-stage larvae are normally found attached to the mucosa of the stomach (typically, G. intestinalis), duodenum (G. na-salis, G. haemorrhoidalis), or rectum (G. haemorrhoidalis, G. inermis), where they cause focal superficial mucosal ul-ceration. 2 There is little evidence of significant advers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} immunological aspect of parasitic <b>Gasterophilus</b> <b>intestinalis</b> (Diptera, Oestridae) <b>larvae</b> causing horse gastric myiasis. The objectives of this research were to analyze the protein content of larval crude extracts of the migrating second and third larvae (L 2 and L 3) of G. intestinalis in order to characterize the immune response of horses. Results The proteomic profile of L 2 and L 3, investigated by using one and two dimensional approaches, revealed a migration pattern specific to each larval stage. Furthermore, Western blots were performed with horse sera and with sera of Balb/c mice immunised with the larval crude extracts of L 2 or L 3, revealing a different immune reaction in naturally infected horses vs. artificially induced immune reaction in mice. The comparisons of the immunoblot profiles demonstrate that the stage L 2 is more immunogenic than the stage L 3 most likely as an effect of the highest enzymatic production of L 2 while migrating through the host tissues. Fifteen proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Conclusion This work provides further information into the understanding of the interaction between G. intestinalis and their host and by contributing a novel scheme of the proteomic profile of the main larval stages. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Gasterophilus is a genus of {{parasitic}} {{flies in}} the family Oestridae which includes the horse botfly. They lay eggs on horses, caribou, donkeys, and similar animals, usually equines. The eggs are laid depending on the species of gasterophilus. There are two species - Gasterophilus nasalis, and <b>gasterophilus</b> <b>intestinalis.</b> Nasalis lay eggs around the mouth, eyes, nose, and chin. Intestinalis lay eggs around the lower legs, and shoulders. The eggs hatch by licking, moisture or humidity. The <b>gasterophilus</b> <b>intestinalis</b> then travel to the mouth where larvae are hatched and travel into the intestines. The gasterophilus nasalis travel to the sinus cavities and/or the brain. Gasterophilus is laid by the bot fly {{which looks like a}} bumble bee, which hovers around the ground. These can be managed and held down to a lower number by a de-worming schedule and removing the eggs with a bot comb or a grooming block. Intestinal bots in large numbers can cause gastrointestinal problems with animals. [...] There are exceptional cases of human babies infected by these flies.|$|R

However, the level of genetic homology of the Polish and Italian G. intestinalis specimens (intra-specific variation rate: 1. 27 %) was {{similar to that of the}} G. <b>intestinalis</b> <b>larvae</b> collected in northeastern Poland (intra-specific variation rate: 0. 94 %) and those collected in southern Italy (intra-specific variation rate: 1. 16 %). Analysis of the restriction enzyme sites in the coxI gene of G. nasalis and G. intestinalis showed that the nucleotide polymorphism (NP) at position 1050 of this gene determines cleavage by MnlI only in G. nasalis, making it possible to differentiate the two species using PCR-RFLP. Interestingly, comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the PCR-amplified coxI gene fragments from the Italian specimens of G. nasalis with other analyzed cox 1 genes revealed an additional NP at position 1236 of cox 1 gene, recognized by MnlI.

For the purpose 2935 working donkeys were coprologically examined for nematode and cestode, and 215 donkeys for trematode infections. Seven donkeys that died due to various health problems or were euthanased on a welfare ground were necropsied and the parasites were recovered and identified to the species level. The {{study was conducted}} during the periods 1996 - 1999. Coprological examination revealed 99 % strongyle, 80 % Fasciola, 51 % Parascaris, 30 % Gastrodiscus, 11 % Strongyloides westeri, 8 % cestodes and 2 % Oxyuris equi infection prevalence. Over 55 % of donkeys had more than 1000 eggs per gram of faeces (epg). Forty two different species of parasites consisting of 33 nematodes, 3 trematodes, 3 cestodes and 3 arthropod larvae were identified from postmortem examined donkeys. Among the nematodes 17 species of Cyathostominae and 7 species of Strongylinae were identified.

40|$|Gasterophilus larvae {{are common}} obligate parasites of the {{digestive}} tract of the equids. Horses become infected with this parasite by ingesting the larvae hatched from eggs laid by the female flies. In this study carried out monthly, we (i) counted the Gasterophilus eggs deposited by female flies on the coat of 30 grazing horses, (ii) counted and identified the Gasterophilus larvae retrieved from {{the digestive tract}} of 128 slaughtered horses, and (iii) compared these results to meteorological data. Eggs were deposited on all monitored horses, and were present from October to January and from May to September, whereas they were absent from February to April. The number of laid eggs was significantly different between the months, body regions, genders, and age classes (p [*] &# 60;[*] 0. 05). Larvae were recovered in 112 (87. 5 %) horses, and 6 species of Gasterophilus were identified. The prevailing species were <b>Gasterophilus</b> <b>intestinalis</b> (recovered in 110 horses; 85. 9 %) and Gasterophilus nasalis (69 horses; 53. 9 %), recovered in all months. Gasterophilus inermis (5 horses; 3. 9 %), Gasterophilus pecorum (3 horses; 2. 3 %), Gasterophilus haemorrhoidalis (3 horses; 2. 3 %) ¸ and Gasterophilus meridionalis (2 horses; 1. 6 %) larvae were also found. Significant differences were found among monthly larval burdens for both Gasterophilus spp. and G. intestinalis (p [*]&# 60;[*] 0. 05), but not for G. nasalis (p &# 60;[*] 0. 05). Larval burdens and prevalences did not differed significantly between both genders and age classes (p [*]&# 60;[*] 0. 05). Monthly eggs and larvae trends were not significantly correlated (p &# 62;[*] 0. 05). With regard to the meteorological variables, minimum air temperature was significantly correlated with the eggs trend (rho[*]=[*] 1. 000; p [*]&# 60;[*] 0. 001) and maximum air temperature with the Gasterophilus spp. (rho[*]=[*] 0. 972; p [*]&# 60;[*][*] 0. 001) and G. intestinalis (rho[*]=[*] 0. 972; p [*]&# 60;[*] 0. 001) larvae trends.

Endogenous heme hexa-coordination is generally provided in these Hbs by the E 7 residue (often His), which thus modulates accessibility to the heme distal pocket and reactivity of the heme toward exogenous ligands.

Different secretion mechanisms (merocrine, apocrine and microapocrine) occur along the midgut epithelium. Abundant microorganisms are observed in the endoperitrophic space of the anterior midgut. The origin and nature of these microorganisms remain unknown. No structural differences are observed between the second and third instar midguts. The salivary glands of G. intestinalis second and third instars consist of a pair of elongated tubular structures connected to efferent ducts which unite to form a single deferent duct linked dorsally to the pharynx.

Between January 2007 and January 2009, two experiments were carried out on free-ranging horses in northwest Spain. During the first year, monthly blood samples were collected from a herd of 25 horses. In the second year, a monthly serological survey was conducted {{for a total of}} 398 different horses. All the sera were analyzed by ELISA using excretory/secretory antigens from <b>Gasterophilus</b> <b>intestinalis</b> (GphiL 2 ES) and Gasterophilus nasalis second-stage larvae (GphnL 2 ES). Climatic data were collected between January 2007 and January 2009 from local meteorological automated stations to establish the weather pattern in the study area. Observations of Gasterophilus eggs on the horses’ hair and third instars passed in the faeces were also done. The kinetics of IgG response decreased against GphiL 2 ES from January to July, increased slowly from August and rose up to January. After a slight decrease in January, the absorbances against GphnL 2 ES reduced from April to August, when the lowest values were observed. The IgG values rose {{until the end of the}} study in January. Third instars were observed in the faeces in March to May, and Gasterophilus eggs were seen on the horses’ hair from June to September. The highest IgG seroprevalences were achieved in winter (January–February; 100 %) against both antigens. The lowest percentages of seropositivity were observed in June (3 %) to the GphiL 2 ES, and in July (9 %) to the GphnL 2 ES. The use of antigens from G. <b>intestinalis</b> second-stage <b>larvae</b> was shown to be suitable for diagnosing infestation by G. intestinalis or G. nasalis. We concluded that under oceanic climate conditions, the egg-laying period occurs from late spring, and eggs and first instars are found in the mouth in early summer. During summer the second instars move into the stomach and intestine, where the third-stage larvae remain until the end of winter, when pupation takes place.

Post-mortem examinations were performed on 71 horses over a period of 24 months. Gastric ulcers were found in 52 horses (73. 2 %). There was no significant association between age or sex and occurrence of gastric ulcers. In all horses the squamous mucosa lesions were localised near the margo plicatus (100 % of the cases), whereas in 23 horses the lesions were near the margo plicatus and lesser curvature and in 7 horses at the greater curvature. In 18 horses the mucosa was affected in the whole extent of the margo plicatus and in 1 horse diffuse lesions of the squamous mucosa were noted. Lesions of the glandular mucosa were localised in 11 horses at the fundic area, in 1 horse they occurred in the pylorus, and in 10 horses diffuse lesions of the glandular mucosa were recorded.

Although only vertebrates have a distinct hypothalamus—the source of numerous neurohormone peptides that play pivotal roles in the development, function, and maintenance of various neuronal and endocrine systems, it is suggested that the Ciona brain contains a region that corresponds to the vertebrate hypothalamus. To identify genes expressed in the brain, we isolated brain vesicles using transgenic embryos carrying Ci-β-tubulin(promoter) ::Kaede, which resulted in robust Kaede expression in the larval CNS. The associated transcriptome was investigated using microarray analysis. We identified 565 genes that were preferentially expressed in the larval brain. Among these genes, 11 encoded neurohormone peptides including such hypothalamic peptides as gonadotropin-releasing hormone and oxytocin/vasopressin. Six of the identified peptide genes had not been previously described. We also found that genes encoding receptors for some of the peptides were expressed in the brain.

40|$|Abstract Background Virtually all {{horses are}} {{infected}} with helminth parasites. For some decades, the control of parasites of Swedish horses {{has been based on}} routine treatments with anthelmintics, often several times per year. Since anthelmintic resistance is becoming an increasing problem it is essential to develop more sustainable control strategies, which are adapted to different types of horse management. The aim {{of this study was to}} obtain information on practices used by Swedish horse owners for the control of endoparasites. Methods A questionnaire with 26 questions about management practices and parasite control routines was posted to 627 randomly selected horse establishments covering most types of horse management in Sweden. Results The response rate was good in all categories of respondents (66 – 78 %). A total of 444 questionnaires were used in the analyses. It was found that virtually all horses had access to grazing areas, usually permanent. Generally, pasture hygiene was infrequently practiced. Thirty-six percent of the respondents clipped or chain harrowed their pastures, whereas weekly removal of faeces from the grazing areas was performed by 6 % of the respondents, and mixed or rotational grazing with other livestock by 10 %. The number of anthelmintic treatments per year varied from 1 – 8 with an average of 3. 2. Thirty-eight percent considered late autumn (Oct-Dec) to be the most important time for deworming. This finding, and an increased use of macrocyclic lactones in the autumn, suggests a concern about bot flies, <b>Gasterophilus</b> <b>intestinalis.</b> Only 1 % of the respondents stated that faecal egg counts (FEC) were performed on a regular basis. The relatively high cost of FEC analyses compared to purchase of anthelmintics was thought to contribute to the preference of deworming without a previous FEC. From the study it was evident that all categories of horse owners took advice mainly from veterinarians. Conclusion The results show that routines for endoparasite control can be improved in many horse establishments. To increase the knowledge of equine endoparasite control and follow the recommendations for how to reduce the spread of anthelmintic resistance, a closer collaboration between parasitologists and veterinary practitioners is desirable. </p...|$|R

On the whole, 125 (82. 2 %) horses were infected by larvae of Gasterophilus spp. and 214 second stage larvae (L 2) and 13, 342 third stage larvae (L 3) collected. Five species of Gasterophilus were identified with the following prevalence: G. intestinalis= 95. 2 %, G. nasalis= 44. 8 %, G. inermis= 15. 2 %, G. pecorum= 2. 6 % and G. haemorrhoidalis= 0. 8 %. L 3 were retrieved throughout the observation period with the highest mean burdens from January to August 2003 while the lowest mean was registered from September to November 2003. L 2 were collected in February-March 2003 and from September to December 2003. The majority of the animals (n= 66, 43. 4 %) were infected with a single Gasterophilus species, however, 45 animals (29. 6 %) harboured 2 species, 12 animals (7. 9 %) 3 species and 2 animals (1. 3 %) 4 species. The trend of abundance in the L 3 of G. intestinalis and G. nasalis, the most represented species, was highly concordant (r= 0. 5, p< 0. 001). A retrospective comparison of our results and of other data from four seasons of observation (1983 - 1986) in central Italy showed {{that the number of}} G. inermis, G. pecorum and G. haemorrhoidalis have been decreasing relative to G. intestinalis and G. nasalis which may suggest tendency toward the extinction of the three former species of Gasterophilus...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of anthelmintic resistance to benzimidazoles and avermectin in cyathostome nematodes in New Zealand horses was investigated using a larval development assay (LDA) {{to conduct a}} small survey. For the benzimidazoles the analogue, thiabendazole was used and for avermectin the analogues, ivermectin and ivermectin aglycone {{were used in the}} LDA. The normal range of LD 50 values was estimated by assaying eggs from Kaimanawa feral horses (n = 22) for each analogue used. From these the mean LD 50 values + 2 xstandard deviation was taken as the upper limit of normal. The survey involved domestic horses (n = 47) from several locations around New Zealand. For ivermectin and ivermectin aglycone 12 % had LD 50 values higher than normal with resistance factors up to 5. 3 and 6. 8 respectively. This represents horses from three separate farms. For the benzimidazoles 43 % of domestic horses had higher than normal LD 50 values with resistance factors up to 4. 8. These results suggest that some nematodes in these domestic horses had an increased tolerance to avermectins and as well as to benzimidazoles. Two studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of a combination of abamectin (0. 2 mg/kg), oxibendazole (10 mg/kg) and bithionol (5 mg/kg or 7 mg. kg). In the first study bithionol was included at 5 mg/kg and in the second study it was included at 7 mg/kg. These studies showed the efficacy of the combination was > 98 % against adult luminal stages of S. vulgaris, S. edentatus, cyathostomes, migratory stages of S. edentatus and third instar stages of <b>Gasterophilus</b> <b>intestinalis.</b> Efficacy against mucosal stages of cyathostomes (about 64 %) and arterial stages of S. vulgaris (71 %) was poor. Inclusion of bithionol at 7 mg/kg achieved an efficacy of 100 % against A. perfoliata whereas at 5 mg/kg the efficacy was only 84. 6 %. In these studies the following species were identified: two species of Strongylus (S. vulgaris and S. edentatus); three species of Triodontophorus (T. serratus, T. minor and T. tenuicollis); and twelve species of cyathostomes (Cyathostomum coronatum, Cyathostomum labiatum, Cyathostomum catinatum, Cylicocyclus nassatus, Cylicocyclus leptostomus, Cylicocyclus radiatus, Cylicocyclus insigne, Cylicostephanus poculatus, Cylicostephanus minutus, Cylicostephanus calicatus, Cylicostephanus longibursatus and Cylicostephanus goldi) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn most ascidians, the tadpole-like {{swimming}} larvae dramatically {{change their}} body-plans during metamorphosis and develop into sessile adults. The mechanisms of ascidian metamorphosis have been researched and debated for many years. Until now {{information on the}} detailed time course of the initiation and completion of each metamorphic event has not been described. One dramatic and important event in ascidian metamorphosis is tail regression, in which ascidian larvae lose their tails to adjust themselves to sessile life. In the present study, we measured the time associated with tail regression in the ascidian Ciona <b>intestinalis.</b> <b>Larvae</b> are thought to acquire competency for each metamorphic event in certain developmental periods. We show that the timing with which the competence for tail regression is acquired {{is determined by the}} time since hatching, and this timing is not affected by the timing of post-hatching events such as adhesion. Because larvae need to adhere to substrates with their papillae to induce tail regression, we measured the duration for which larvae need to remain adhered in order to initiate tail regression and the time needed for the tail to regress. Larvae acquire the ability to adhere to substrates before they acquire tail regression competence. We found that when larvae adhered before they acquired tail regression competence, they were able to remember the experience of adhesion until they acquired the ability to undergo tail regression. The time course of the events associated with tail regression provides a valuable reference, upon which the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ascidian metamorphosis can be elucidated...|$|R

When compared with sequences in databases, 545 of the clusters showed significant matches (P < E- 15) with reported proteins, while 153 showed matches with putative proteins {{for which there is}} not enough information to categorize their function, and 315 had no significant sequence similarities to known proteins. Sequence-similarity analyses of the 545 clusters in relation to the biological functions demonstrated that 407 of them have functions that many kinds of cells use, 104 are associated with cell–cell communication, and 34 are transcription factors or other gene-regulatory proteins. Sequence prevalence distribution analysis demonstrated that more than one-half of the mRNAs are rare mRNAs. All of the 1013 clusters were subjected to whole-mount in situ hybridization to analyze the gene expression profile in the tadpole larva. A total of 361 clusters showed expression specific to a certain tissue or organ: 96 showed epidermis-specific expression, 60 were specific to the nervous system, 108 to endoderm, 34 to mesenchyme, 5 to trunk lateral cells, 4 to trunk ventral cells, 23 to notochord, 28 to muscle, and 3 to siphon rudiments. In addition, 190 clusters showed expression in multiple tissues. Moreover, nervous system-specific genes showed intriguing expression patterns dependent on the cluster. The present study highlights a broad spectrum of genes that are used in the formation {{of one of the most}} primitive chordate body plans as well as for the function of various types of tissue and organ and also provides molecular markers for individual tissues and organs constituting the Ciona larva...|$|R

This study provides a high-resolution cellular analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -positive and dopamine-positive cells in Ciona <b>intestinalis</b> embryos and <b>larvae.</b> Dopamine cells are present only in the sensory vesicle of the Ciona larval brain, which may be an ancestral chordate feature.

40|$|Ascidian {{swimming}} larvae bear three peculiar {{organs of}} ectodermic origin, named “palps” or adhesive papillae, {{located in the}} anterior region of cephalenteron. Term “adhesive” is correlated {{to one of the}} function of these structure based on secretion of an adhesive substance which enables swimming larvae to adhere to a substratum. Recently a sensory function has also been described in some Phlebobranchia papillae with a simple morpho-functional organization. There are few ultrastructural investigations in literature, sometimes disputed, able to make clear papillae cells functions. To clarify this problem, a comparative investigation has been carried out, just in this work, about ultrastructural and morpho-functional organizations of adhesive papillae of three ascidian swimming larvae, Ascidia malaca, Phallusia mammillata and Ciona intestinalis. The investigations has been carried out by transmission electronic microscopy and confocal microscopy. Papillae of above-mentionated ascidian swimming larvae, are three in number and they are located at the vertices of a triangular field. According to a recent classification scheme by Burighel and Cloney, they are coniform and non-eversible simple type papillae. In the apex of each papilla there is an hyaline cap with an electron-dense substance made of proteoglycan component. It’s quite certain that this substance is used by ascidian larvae to adhere to the substratum. Ultrastructural investigations carried out on the adhesive papillae of Ascidia malaca and Phallusia mammillata have not emphasize significant ultrastructural differences in the papillae cells body. Ascidia malaca and Phallusia mammillata papillae are made of three types of cells that characterize their functions: a) collocytes, b) axial columnar cells, c) sensory cells. Collocytes, whose ultrastructure is typical of cells with secretory activity, are certainly deputed to form adhesive secretion. They lie in a median or semilateral side of the papillar body. Axial columnar cells that show an elongated shape, lie in the mid-central papillae region and they are characterized by the presence, in their apical part of long microvilli that run along the whole of hyaline cap length. Above a structural supporting role, it is supposed a possible sensory function concerning these cells. Sensory cells presents an ovoidal and elongated shape holding on tight at their base like a funnel lying a lateral and marginal position in papillar body. These type of cells have been described in Ascidia malaca which can be classified as primary sensory neurons. These are characterized by the presence of a single cilium in the apical end and by an axonicprocess at their base extending over papilla. Ultrastructural investigations on the adhesive papillae of Ciona intestinalis confirmed, even if showing some differences, ultrastructural likeness the two above-mentioned species of adhesive papillae. Collocytes with secretory activity, sensory cells and columnar axial cells come into sight also in Ciona intestinalis papillae. The columnar axial cells ultrastructure is different from the Ascidia malaca and Phallusia mammillata papillae. In the apical part of these cells there are not microvilli but digitiform protusions with numerous microtubules inside running paralleling along longitudinal cell axis. The ultrastructure of these cells suggest their lengthening ability to allow digitiform protrusions to put into contact with the cuticular layer of hyaline cap apex, during step before the adhesion. Ultrastructural characteristics suggest that they can also perform a sensorial duty but their mechanism is still unclear. The observation was carried out by confocal microscopy on the ascidian larvae just before or at the beginning of adhesion to the substratum (6 - 7 hours from hatching). The use of anti-β-tubulin antibody, have shown an extensive nervous network in all three Ascidiae species starting from the papillar base and converging into only one nerve extending up to the cerebral vescicle. These data confirm previous observations carried out with confocal microscopy on Ascidia malaca and Phallusia mammillata. <b>larvae.</b> In Ciona <b>intestinalis</b> adhesive papillae marked with anti-β- tubulin antibody, the fluorescence is more bright than Phallusia mammillata and Ascidia malaca. Probably this result is correlated with apical protrusion rich in microtubule. Ultrastructure observations of some neurons being in the anterior region of cephalenteron, extending from the base of papilla to the cerebral vescicle, have been emphasized in this work. These neurons are in the same position of the ones described like RTEN (rostral trunk epidermal neuron) by Imai and Meinertzhagen and they are formed by cellular ovoidal body extending into a long axon. Ultrastructural of these neurons have pointed out likeness with vertebrate neurons. Concluding, ultrastructural investigations have emphasize only some difference between papillar cells of Ascidia malaca, Phallusia mammillata and Ciona <b>intestinalis</b> <b>larvae,</b> confirming adhesive and sensory functions...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} Ciona intestinalis -aminobutyric acid (GABA) -ergic neurons during development, {{studying the}} expression pattern of Ci-GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase: GABA synthesizing enzyme) by in situ hybridization. Moreover, we cloned two GABAB receptor subunits (Ci-GABABRs), and a phylogenetic analysis (neighbor-joining method) {{suggested that they}} clustered with their vertebrate counterparts. We compared Ci-GAD and Ci-GABABRs expression patterns in C. <b>intestinalis</b> embryos and <b>larvae.</b> At the tailbud stage, Ci-GAD expression was widely detected in central and peripheral nervous system (CNS/PNS) precursors, whereas Ci- GABABRs expression was evident {{at the level of}} the precursors of the visceral ganglion. GABA was localized by immunohistochemistry at the same developmental stage. In the larva, Ci-GAD transcripts and GABA immunofluorescence were also detected throughout the CNS and in some neurons of the PNS, whereas transcripts of both GABAB receptor subunits were found mainly in the CNS. The expression pattern of Ci-GABABRs appeared restricted to Ci-GAD-positive territories in the sensory vesicle, whereas, in the visceral ganglion, Ci-GABABRs transcripts were found in ventral motoneurons that did not express Ci-GAD. Insofar as GABAergic neurons are widely distributed also in the CNS and PNS of vertebrates and other invertebrate chordates, it seems likely that GABA signaling was extensively present in the protochordate nervous system. Results from this work show that GABA is the most widespread inhibitory neurotransmitter in C. intestinalis nervous system and that it can signal through GABAB receptors both pre- and postsynaptically to modulate different sensory inputs and subsequent swimming activity...|$|R
40|$|There are {{currently}} four invasive tunicate species which are causing significant {{challenges to the}} aquaculture industry in Atlantic Canada: Ciona intestinalis, Styela clava, Botryllus schlosseri and Botrylloides violaceus. These tunicates foul mussel socks, aquaculture gear, boat hulls and wharves. As with many aquatic invasive species, detection of these tunicates mostly occurs once adult populations have reached significant population sizes. However, once populations have reached these levels, there is often little {{that can be done}} to stop or slow the invasion. Having efficient and sensitive assays that could detect invasive tunicates at microscopic stages would be advantageous as management strategies could be implemented before populations spike to invasive levels. Such an assay would also be useful in monitoring mussel processing plant effluent so that invasive tunicate eggs and larvae are not spread through effluent water discharge to adjacent bays. Molecular assays have been developed in this study that can detect the four invasive tunicate species in both mussel processing effluent water and in bay water surrounding mussel leases. These assays are highly specific and have a sensitivity of detection of 1 - 5 eggs and/or larvae per water sample. In addition qRT-PCR assays have been developed that can detect and distinguish between different life stages of Ciona <b>intestinalis</b> (egg and <b>larvae)</b> in water samples. This qRT-PCR assay also has the capacity to evaluate viability of free swimming larvae so that nonviable larvae do not cause false positives during mussel processing plant effluent monitoring. The high throughput capacity, high specificity and sensitivity of these assays shows excellent potential for use as a monitoring tool for aquatic invasive species in screening ballast water, effluent waste from shellfish processing plants, as well in local bays and rivers. This study also used phylogenetic analyses of the cytochrome oxidase 1 gene to determine that populations of Botryllus schlosseri in Prince Edward Island have low genetic diversity. Only two haplotypes of B. schlosseri were found in this study in PEI, one which was found in all aquaculture bays tested and the other found only on native substrate in one bay. It is likely that local activity spread this species to other areas of Prince Edward Island after the initial invasion. Phylogeographic analysis suggests that this species was likely transported from Massachusetts to Nova Scotia and then was transported to Prince Edward Island via local boating activity or through the movement of aquaculture species. Through the development of these efficient detection methods and by determining source populations and possible vectors responsible for transporting invasive species to this region, it is hoped that new invasions of aquatic invasive species can be prevented and/or managed before they pose a risk to the aquaculture industry in Prince Edward Island...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the class}} of organotin compounds, the most well known is {{tributyltin}} (TBT). Organotin have many applications, which include use in PVC, as catalyst in chemical reactions, agricultural pesticides and antifungal treatments for textile polymers. In particular TBT is used in marine antifoulant paints to prevent the growth of organisms such as barnacles on the hull of ships. Extensive use in antifouling paints led to the widespread distribution of TBT and its breakdown products in the global marine, sediment and biota. High levels of TBT in the waters {{were found to have}} impaired reproduction, by inhibiting embryogenesis and larval development in a variety of marine organisms. Symptoms of the exposure to high levels of TBT in some invertebrates includes the development of male sexual characteristics as a penis and vas deferens by females (imposex). Ascidians are a good model for the study of embryonal development. They are also sensitive bioindicators of habitat degradation. The effects of tributyltin (IV) chloride (TBT chloride) solutions on ascidian embryos of Ciona intestinalis at different stages of development have been described. Previously, we carried out observations with both the light and the electron microscope on Ciona <b>intestinalis</b> embryos and <b>larvae</b> incubated in TBT solutions. This studies showed morphological and ultrastructural modifications of the embryos and larvae after incubation in TBT chloride at different concentrations. To understand molecular effects of TBT-induced on ascidians embryogenesis we have set out to study the effects of TBT at different concentrations, testing the activity of some protein with a basic role in embryonic development. In ascidian embryos, a fibroblast growth factor (FGF) -like signal has been proposed to be involved in induction of notochord and mesoderm formation. A main pathway is a protein kinase transduction pathway, which includes Ras, Raf, mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/MAP kinase (ERK). The aim of this work in progress is to understand whether the TBT exposure on ascidian embryos at different stage of development cause alterations in tyrosine phosphorylation pattern and in MAPK activity. Tyrosine phosphorylation promotes cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, due to activity of receptor tyrosine kinases and furthermore different stressors are known to stimulate tyrosine kinase activity. At first we focused our attention on tyrosine phosphorylation pattern after ascidian embryos to different stage of development TBT treatment. Phosphorylated proteins pattern is evaluated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting on protein extract of ascidianembryos incubated with TBT, using anti-phosphotyrosine-antibody directed against mammalian phosphotyrosine. Preliminary results showed a different pattern on protein phosphorylation in response to the incubation with TBT in μM range. Since MAPKs {{play a key role in}} animal responses to a wide variety of environmental stresses, we have thought to test the role of MAPK pathway proteins such as MAPK p 38 (Thr 180 and Tyr 182), p 44 / 42 (Thr 202 /Tyr 204) and c-Jun Nterminal kinases (JNK) after TBT treatment...|$|R
40|$|Species {{respond to}} {{environmental}} heterogeneity {{through a variety}} of mechanisms such as plasticity, genetic adaptation and phenotypic buffering. Determining how gene flow, scale of environmental heterogeneity and trait heritability influence these responses is important for understanding how these different mechanisms arise, which is a central task in the field of evolutionary biology. For many marine organisms salinity is an important driver of environmental heterogeneity and physiological stress. As with many stressors, salinity stress is often more severe for early life-history stages such as embryos and larvae. The main aim of this thesis was to investigate underlying mechanisms that allow species to cope with environmental heterogeneities in their natural environment. More specifically, I focused on strategies to manage salinity differences in early life-history stages of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis. This marine invertebrate has a large geographical distribution and is considered highly invasive {{in some parts of the}} world. Plasticity in important fitness related traits is generally considered to promote invasiveness even though there is evidence that local adaptation also could play an important role in range expansions of invasive species. Through investigations of population differences in larval performance, I wanted to understand what mechanisms allowed existing populations to inhabit different salinity regimes, focusing explicitly on the role of transgenerational phenotypic plasticity. Adult acclimation had a predominant effect on tolerance ranges of developing embryos and larvae, but there were also small signs of population differences that could be related to local adaptation and/or persistent environmental effects. To better understand the potential for adaptation of larval salinity tolerance I used quantitative genetic methods to assess the extent to which larval performance in different salinities is a heritable trait. Heritable variation proved to be extremely low, suggesting limited potential for local adaption in investigated populations. The potential for local adaptation can be strongly influenced by gene flow between populations that inhabit different environments. C. <b>intestinalis</b> has pelagic <b>larvae,</b> which could disperse over relatively large areas, thereby preventing local genetic differentiation. Through a population genetic study we found that gene flow at times was restricted at much smaller scales than suggested by the dispersal potential of larvae. Population structures implied that physical barriers, such as density differences between water masses, restricted larval dispersal. The study of sexual selection is an important field in evolutionary biology. Traditionally, it was assumed that sexual selection could not operate in sessile marine invertebrates with external fertilization. Today, however, there are many examples of mechanisms governing gamete interactions that allow eggs to "select" sperm. Our understanding of the underlying selective pressures, and indeed how these mechanisms affect fertilization success between individuals within a species, is however limited. I examined causes of variation in fertilization success in populations of C. intestinalis. I found significant variability in compatibility between parental genotypes, which indicated that this may be a way for individuals to avoid the negative effects of inbreeding...|$|R
