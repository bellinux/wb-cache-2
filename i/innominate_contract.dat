5000|$|A {{commodatum}} was a {{loan for}} use. It did not transfer ownership nor possession, {{and was also}} gratuitous (no interest could be charged). If interest was included, the agreement was instead either one of hire or an <b>innominate</b> <b>contract.</b> It {{was assumed to be}} for a [...] "reasonable time" [...] if this was not specified {{at the time of the}} agreement. Land could be the subject of a commodatum during the Classical period and later, though this was doubted before that. Perishables could not be loaned for use, unless they were to be used for display purposes only, or a small number of other exceptions. The lender under a commodatum did not have to be owner, since ownership was not transferred.|$|E
40|$|My diploma thesis called "Distribution Agreements" treats of {{distribution}} agreements as one possible way {{of distribution}} of products. Distribution agreements are {{a type of}} distribution relations arrangement where the purchaser buys products from the supplier in order to distribute them. The topic of distribution agreements is interesting especially from {{the reason that the}} distribution agreements are a very frequent and necessary legal instrument in business relations, but are not legaly regulated on national, european or even on the international scale. Neither the law theory treats of them too much. On the other side, there is a quite broad decision practice of Competion Authority and practice of the European Court of Justice. These decisions were used as a basis of this thesis. Distribution agreements do not only handle the contractual relationship, but they have often anti-competitive effects. In this diploma thesis I handle both the aspect of contractual law and the aspect of competition law. The aim of the work is especially to describe the distribution agreement in the sence of an <b>innominate</b> <b>contract</b> type and to determine its essentials. The core of the work is a categorization of distribution agreements into individual types of distribution agreements, their characteristics and finding [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Diploma thesis <b>Innominate</b> <b>Contracts</b> in Business Relations {{deals with}} a legal basis of <b>innominate</b> <b>contracts</b> in the Czech private law. It focuses mainly on so the called Modern <b>innominate</b> <b>contracts.</b> The purpose of the thesis was to answer whether leasing, {{factoring}} and franchising contracts should be codified. Consequently, it aimed to prove or disprove that the Czech legal regulation {{does not reflect the}} recent developments in business environment. The thesis is divided into two parts. In the first chapter an analysis is carried out on the legal regulation of <b>innominate</b> <b>contracts</b> in the Czech business law, civil law, labour law and international private law. The legality of <b>innominate</b> <b>contracts</b> and the applicability of an analogy is discussed in this part. Based on the Czech legal regulations and court decisions it was concluded that <b>innominate</b> <b>contracts</b> were valid and that courts may use analogy when deciding on civil or commercial contracts. The second chapter deals with the contents of leasing, factoring and franchising contracts. It concludes that there are reasons against the codification of the above mentioned contracts. The content of an operating leasing agreement very much resembles a rental contract which might be used for this kind of leasing contract. A leasing purchase contract does not present any new answers to issues which had already been dealt with by court decisions. The substance of a factoring contract [...] assignment of a receivable is already regulated by the Civil Code. A franchising agreement involves parts of many types of codified contracts and interlocks with multiple legal areas. Moreover, all the above mentioned contracts are challenged by a fast pace of development therefore a codification could hamper the progress or it could become obsolete. Based on the above mentioned facts the thesis concludes that leasing, factoring and franchising contracts should not be codified in the Czech private law as separate contract types and therefore disproves the primary proposition of this thesis and subsequently infers that the Czech legal regulations do not reflect a recent business development...|$|R
50|$|In Roman law, {{contracts}} {{could be}} divided between those in re, {{those that were}} consensual, and those Thatcher were <b>innominate</b> <b>contracts</b> in Roman law. Although Gaius only identifies a single type of contract in re, it is commonly thought that there were four, as Justinian identifies: mutuum (loan for consumption), commodatum (loan for use), depositum (deposit) and pignus (pledge).|$|R
50|$|In {{civil law}} jurisdictions, a {{nominate}} contract is a standardized contractual relationship {{that has a}} special designation attached to it (e.g., purchase and sale, lease, loan, insurance), as opposed to <b>innominate</b> <b>contracts</b> (which are not standardized and therefore have no set name). The obligor and obligee have rights and obligations specially prescribed by law. Nominate contracts are usually statutorily required to include certain express terms (essentialia)—depending on their kind—and are construed to include terms implied in law.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} trade {{operations in}} lea­sin­g companies as specific businesses enabling acquisition of possession by legal and physical persons by gradual repayments {{of the purchase}} price. On a diagram it shows the complexity of business relations between the main participants of a lea­sin­g transaction, which are production companies, lea­sin­g companies and those interested in the subject of lea­sin­g. To capture the complexity of relations, there are also included all other participants. Their function in a lea­sin­g transaction starts only at the moment, when the leaseholders {{are not able to}} pay their liabilities to which they agreed in the <b>innominate</b> <b>contract.</b> Paper clarifies the term “lea­sin­g with zero mark-up”. With the help of calculation it describes the basis of a lea­sin­g transaction, where significantly participates also the production company, insurance company and commercial bank. All these subjects have certain benefits from a realized transaction. These are enabled by their close business relationships with the lea­sin­g company, which is sufficiently clear from the diagram and it is also substantiated by calculations. Paper includes a definition of lea­sin­g operations, as well as a ma­the­ma­ti­cal model of lea­sin­g payments calculation for a car. A part of the paper is also dealing with a cession of a lea­sin­g contract in the person of a leaseholder as a specific case enforced by financial issues of the leaseholder. The paper elaborates alternatives of evaluating client’s bonding capacity with the help of financial indicators...|$|E
40|$|According to the Labour Code of 1974 the {{employment}} relationship is an obligation between a single employee and an employer. The basis {{of such a}} relationship is {{the employment}} contract concluded with each employee separately. The Polish labour legislation does not provide for the institution of so-called group employment relationships concluded by several people jointly {{on the one hand}} and an employer on the other. However, such contracts appear in connection with a new trend of introducing in state enterprises so-called group forms of work organization. By virtue of such contracts, a voluntarily established group of people assumes the obligation of performing jointly a given production task for a stated remuneration which is later divided among the members of a group by the independent decision of the whole group. According to the majority opinion of legal scholars, such contracts are not a legally separate type of contracts but are in fact only a sum of so-called „autonomous clauses", i. e. contractual stipulations which complement the contents of employment contracts concluded by an employer with each individual member of a group. The author criticizes the above view and tries to prove that the basis of employing in a group system of work is a separate contract for collective labour which may be characterized as an <b>innominate</b> <b>contract</b> concluded between an employer {{on the one hand and}} a group of employees on the other. The above contract is a source of a so-called joint obligation on the part of the members of a group. The said contract is not the employment contract yet it contains elements typical for a contract of employment as well as a contract for performing a specified task or work and — with respect to relations between the members of a group — elements similar to those appearing in the partnership contract. A complex structure of those group contracts indicates that they are mixed contracts (a type of innominate contracts) imposing the obligation to achieve a stated effect and burdening the employment with a part of the risk to carry out that task. Since the employment contract components prevail, the said contracts are subject to the labour law regulation. Hence, the members of a group enjoy full protection granted by the labour law to people employed by virtue of contracts falling under the Labour Code provisions. The author postulates to adopt the provisions regulating the said type of innominate contracts in the amendments to the Labour Code. In his way a new type of a contract — a contract for rendering collective work — would appear in the Polish labour law. The author agrees in principle that it is high time to break away from a stereotype of the employment contract as a due diligence contract (locatio conducilo operarum), radically different from a contract for performing a specified task or work (locatio conductio operis). The elimination of differences between those two kinds of contracts finds justification in the world trends to make the labour law more flexible in response to the incoming „third wave" of the civilization of our epoch.

50|$|The condictio causa data causa non secuta under Roman law was {{an action}} ("condictio") for {{recovery}} of {{a transfer of}} property, where the purpose for the transfer had failed (causa non secuta). During the recognition of <b>innominate</b> <b>contracts,</b> and their enforcement via the actio praescriptis verbis, the condictio causa data causa non secuta still had relevance, however, outside the field of valid contracts. This {{can be explained by}} reference to the purpose which failed (the basis of the action): where pacta sunt servanda, the purpose is successful on discharge of the legal duties which flow from the contract, namely transfer of the object of the contract.|$|R
40|$|My {{thesis is}} focused on the issues related to a sale of {{undertaking}} or part of undertaking pursuant to the Contract on the Sale of Undertaking. This contract type is governed by the provisions of S. 477 - 488 a of the Commercial Code. After the introduction contained in the first chapter, the second chapter deals with the legal definition of an Undertaking and its part. The concept of Undertaking described in the Czech Commercial Code is broadly constructed in order to cover many different components as a part of any Undertaking. The important distinction between the European law and the laws of the Czech Republic is that the Czech law understands the undertaking merely as a specific object of legal relations. The European law, however, recognized the Undertaking as a subject of legal relations. The third chapter identifies other contract types which could cause the same results as the sale of undertaking; among other the sales <b>contract</b> and specific <b>innominated</b> <b>contract.</b> The legal provisions of contract for sale of Undertaking describe the consequences of the sale and analyzed in the fourth chapter of the thesis. The most important legal issues of this contract type can be identified as (i) the transfer of rights and obligations, (ii) exclusion of certain components of the Undertaking, (iii) liability for [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} fiduciary agreements, which, {{as a form}} of contract, that is {{the means}} of securing obligation and legal claims, are regulated by provisions of specific laws and codifications in some of the European Union countries. Even the Montenegrin legislator enacted a special law governing these legal matters, however in the Serbian law fiduciary agreements fall into the category of <b>innominate</b> <b>contracts.</b> Fiducia originates in the Roman Law and constitutes the first common form of the pledge law. The Latin term fiducia means 'trust', since these legal matters were, first of all, based on the trust between contractual parties. This paper addresses the institution of 'trust' as it is the Anglo-Saxon counterpart of the fiduciary agreement. Etymologically, 'trust' has the same meaning as the term fiducia - trust. Due to their advantages, fiduciary agreements are not even uncommon in the domestic legal practice, while there are certain, as we have already announced, theoretical, but also practical concerns arguing admissibility of this legal matter. These arguments mainly come down to the thesis (mentioned above) that entering into the fiduciary agreement results in violation of the ban on performance of contract lex commissoria in the pledge law. Nevertheless, I provided explanation that differences between contracts of pledge and fiduciary agreements clearly point to the conclusion that fiduciary agreements may not be treated as a pledge, hence they are admissible, that is, they are concluded on the principle of contractual freedom as an imperative norm of the Law on Obligations. Fiduciary agreements (in relation to the realistic means of security) offer to the creditor a higher level of security, reduce the period of payment of his claims, also providing practical benefits for the debtor himself. The paper presents the reasons supporting the view that it would be advantageous for the Serbian legislator, in the process of harmonization of the legislation in the field of Civil Law with the European Union law, to regulate the institute of fiduciary agreements under the special law, integrate it into the Law on Obligations or make it a part of the future Civil Code of the Republic of Serbia...|$|R
