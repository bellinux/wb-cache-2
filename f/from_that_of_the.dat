5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, the Oriental art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet {{was even more}} important to his style. Chinese and Japanese art became the base for the decorative, slightly naïve style in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s. Jolin's style deviates <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional Expressionists, in that he simplifies his motifs in an almost primitive way, painting an imagined reality rather than raw emotions.|$|E

50|$|From 1100 onwards, <b>the</b> dialect <b>of</b> Denmark {{began to}} diverge <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Sweden. <b>The</b> {{innovations}} spread unevenly from Denmark which created {{a series of}} minor dialectal boundaries, isoglosses, ranging from Zealand to Svealand.|$|R

5|$|An {{unidentified}} dark parrot seen {{alive by}} the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa {{was given the}} name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed {{it was from the}} Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description differs <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the scientific names, such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The unidentified parrot may have been an African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) instead.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} way {{to separate the}} trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier actinides elute later. The mendelevium separated by this method {{has the advantage of}} being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after fermium.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|Although the Minucia gens {{has been}} {{traditionally}} {{known as a}} plebeian family, the family's origins are indeed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patrician class and it is <b>from</b> <b>that</b> branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family <b>from</b> which Minucius Augurinus is descended.|$|R

5|$|As the Great Lakes assumed {{their present}} levels, the {{waterfall}} was inundated and Mackinac Island took on its current size. The steep cliffs {{were one of}} the primary reasons for the British army's choice of the island for a fortification; their decision differed <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French army, which had built Fort Michilimackinac about 1715 near present-day Mackinaw City. The limestone formations are still part of the island's appeal. However, tourists are attracted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic formations is Arch Rock, a natural limestone arch, 146feet (45m) above the ground. Other popular geologic formations include Devil's Kitchen, Skull Cave, and Sugar Loaf.|$|E
5|$|Burnley did {{not play}} any {{pre-season}} friendly games other than a practice match between the first team and the reserves, which was watched by a crowd of around 10,000 at Turf Moor. The team's last competitive match had ended in a 0–2 defeat against Manchester United in the Lancashire Senior Cup on 8May 1920, almost four months earlier. The strip for 1920–21 was very little changed <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous season; the claret jersey with light blue sleeves and a light blue stripe around the collar was kept along with the white shorts, but the claret socks were replaced by black.|$|E
5|$|Carnotaurus was {{the first}} {{theropod}} dinosaur discovered with {{a significant number of}} fossil skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and the rib cage. The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, {{the right side of the}} skull also was covered with large patches of skin—this was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. Still, the surface texture of much of the right side of the skull is very different <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left side, and probably shows some features of the scalation pattern of the head.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to higher}} {{elevation}} and precipitation, {{the ecology of}} the Black Hills differs significantly <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by coniferous needleleaf evergreens: various types of pines—including ponderosa (covering , or 80% of the Black Hills forest), lodgepole, white, and timber—as well as western red cedar and spruces. Western yellow ponderosa is the most important lumber tree in the area. The South Dakota state tree is the Black Hills spruce. The Red Valley is home to blue-joint and bluegrasses, and wild plum, Juneberry, and chokecherry shrubs grow in the Hills. Violets, thistles, and horse mint are prevalent herbs. Vines grow widely: the woodbine, bittersweet, and wild grape, which is the pattern for Black Hills gold jewelry.|$|E
5|$|During Pettit's tenure, the Institute progressed {{into the}} top tier of {{technological}} education institutions. Under his leadership, Tech's research budget surpassed the $100 million mark {{for the first time}} in its history. Thomas E. Stelson was Georgia Tech's Vice President for Research from 1974 to 1988. Faced with a longstanding cultural war over the relative merits of basic research versus applied research, Stelson emphasized the importance of both. An increased focus on research activities allowed more funding for academics, which allowed the school's ranking to start a long and continuing rise <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20s. Stelson simultaneously served as the interim director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute from 1975 to 1976, during which time he reorganized the station into eight semi-autonomous laboratories in order to allow each to develop a specialization and clientele—a model that GTRI retains (with slight modifications) to this day.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th {{century the}} bishop began {{to reside in}} Llandaff {{for the first time}} in centuries; no bishops of the see resided in Llandaff for almost 300 years. In 1836 there was another {{unsuccessful}} attempt to transfer the see—this time to Bristol. After the attempt at transferring the see, the office of Dean was restored to Llandaff; the position had not been filled in 700 years. The office of Dean was separated <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Archdeacon of Llandaff in November 1843. The restoration of the Dean's office was the beginning of better times for the cathedral. The new Dean, William Bruce Knight, was instrumental in bringing about the much-needed restorations.|$|E
50|$|Belchamp was a rural {{district}} in Essex in England. It was formed under the Local Government Act 1894 <b>from</b> <b>that</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sudbury rural sanitary district {{which was in}} Essex (the rest going to form the Melford Rural District in West Suffolk).|$|R

5|$|Each of the {{principal}} Upanishads {{can be associated with}} one of the schools of exegesis of the four Vedas (shakhas). Many Shakhas are said to have existed, of which only a few remain. The new Upanishads often have little relation to the Vedic corpus and have not been cited or commented upon by any great Vedanta philosopher: their language differs <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classic Upanishads, being less subtle and more formalized. As a result, they are not difficult to comprehend for the modern reader.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{lived a life}} {{of luxury}} that was often far removed <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} of his subjects.

5|$|Females {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from males {{as they have}} a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not very different <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled. Nesting females also have a brood patch on the bare skin of the belly.|$|E
50|$|Festivals and fairs {{are a part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pashtoon culture. The most {{important}} festivals are the two Eids (Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr).

5|$|Following Nixon, the Democratic Party's state {{convention}} {{instituted a}} rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in Grovey v. Townsend (1935), distinguishing the discrimination by a private organization <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state in the previous primary cases. However, in United States v. Classic (1941), the Court ruled that primary elections were {{an essential part of}} the electoral process, undermining the reasoning in Grovey. Based on Classic, the Court in Smith v. Allwright (1944), overruled Grovey, ruling that denying non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. In the last of the Texas primary cases, Terry v. Adams (1953), the Court ruled that black plaintiffs were entitled to damages from a group that organized whites-only pre-primary elections with the assistance of Democratic party officials.|$|E
5|$|Formerly in {{the genus}} Clemmys, the wood turtle {{is now a}} member of the genus Glyptemys, a {{classification}} that the wood turtle shares with only the bog turtle. It and the bog turtle have a similar genetic makeup, which is marginally different <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), the only current member of the genus Clemmys. The wood turtle has undergone extensive scientific name changes by various scientists over the course of its history.

5|$|From {{the surface}} of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear {{different}} <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit – where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation – rises as expected in the east but slowly. Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.|$|E
