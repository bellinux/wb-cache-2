5|$|For {{the points}} classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for {{finishing}} {{a stage in}} the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The Cima Coppi <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the Giro was the Passo Pordoi, and the first rider to cross it was Fagor–MBK's Jean-Claude Bagot. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided {{the same way as}} the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.|$|E

500|$|There {{were four}} main {{individual}} classifications contested in the 2012 Tour de France, {{as well as}} a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage.

If a crash had happened within the final [...] of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received {{the same time as the}} group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour.

500|$|Christopher Paolini {{started reading}} fantasy books {{when he was}} 10 years old. At the age of 14, as a hobby, he started writing the first novel {{in a series of}} four books, but he could not get beyond a few pages because he had [...] "no idea" [...] where he was going. He began reading {{everything}} he could about the [...] "art of writing", and then plotted the whole Inheritance Cycle book series. After a month of planning out the series, he started writing the draft of Eragon by hand. It was finished a year later, and Paolini began writing the [...] "real" [...] version of the book. After another year of editing, Paolini's parents saw the final manuscript. They immediately saw its potential and decided to publish the book through their small, home-based publishing company, Paolini International. Paolini created the cover art <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> Eragon, which featured Saphira's eye on the cover. He also drew the maps inside the book.|$|E

6000|$|It {{is because}} the passion for books is a sentimental passion {{that people who have}} not felt it always fail to {{understand}} it. Sentiment is not an easy thing to explain. Englishmen especially find it impossible to understand tastes and emotions that are not their own,--the wrongs of Ireland, (till quite recently) the aspirations of Eastern Roumelia, the demands of Greece. If we are to understand the book-hunter, we must never forget that to him books are, in the first place, RELICS. He likes to think that the great writers whom he admires handled just such pages and saw such an arrangement of type as he now beholds. Moliere, for example, corrected the proofs <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the 'Precieuses Ridicules,' when he first discovered [...] "what a labour it is to publish a book, and how GREEN (NEUF) an author is the first time they print him." [...] Or it may be that Campanella turned over, with hands unstrung, and still broken by the torture, these leaves that contain his passionate sonnets. Here again is the copy of Theocritus from which some pretty page may have read aloud to charm the pagan and pontifical leisure of Leo X. This Gargantua is the counterpart of that which the martyred Dolet printed for (or pirated from, alas!) Maitre Francois Rabelais. This woeful ballade, with the woodcut of three thieves hanging from one gallows, came near being the [...] "Last Dying Speech and Confession of Francois Villon." [...] This shabby copy of 'The Eve of St. Agnes' is precisely like that which Shelley doubled up and thrust into his pocket when the prow of the piratical felucca crashed into the timbers of the Don Juan. Some rare books have these associations, and they bring you nearer to the authors than do the modern reprints. Bibliophiles will tell you that it is the early READINGS they care for,--the author's first fancies, and those more hurried expressions which he afterwards corrected. These READINGS have their literary value, especially in the masterpieces of the great; but the sentiment after all is the main thing.|$|E
