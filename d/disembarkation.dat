5|$|There is {{a landing}} place {{used by the}} tourist boats just north of Am Buachaille, but <b>disembarkation</b> is only {{possible}} in calm conditions. The island lacks a genuine anchorage.|$|E
5|$|Mangalore's {{historical}} {{importance is}} {{highlighted by the}} many references to the city by foreign travellers. During the first century CE, Pliny the Elder, a Roman historian, made references to a place called Nitrias, as a very undesirable place for <b>disembarkation,</b> {{on account of the}} pirates which frequent its vicinity, while Greek historian Ptolemy in the second century CE referred to a place called Nitra. Ptolemy's and Pliny the Elder's references were probably made to the Netravati River, which flows through Mangalore. Cosmas Indicopleustes, a Greek monk, in his 6th century work Christian Topography mentions Malabar as the chief seat of the pepper trade, and Mangarouth (port of Mangalore) as one of the five pepper marts which exported pepper.|$|E
5|$|Ulysses appears {{larger than}} his fellow sailors, while the Sirens hold out their arms in {{traditional}} dramatic poses. The three Sirens {{are very similar}} in appearance, and Etty's biographer Leonard Robinson believes it likely that Etty painted the same model in three different poses. Robinson considers their classical poses {{to be the result}} of Etty's lifelong attendance at the Academy's Life Classes, where models were always in traditional poses, while former curator of York Art Gallery Richard Green considers their pose a tribute to the Nereids in Rubens's The <b>Disembarkation</b> at Marseilles, a work Etty is known to have admired and of which he made a copy in 1823.|$|E

40|$|Artisanal fishery at two {{villages in}} Jureia-Itatins Ecological Station, S (a) over tildeo Paulo State, Brazil, was studied between September 2006 and August 2001, {{in order to}} analyze fish {{composition}} and yield, and their relation to environmental variables (rain, tides and moon). Productivily analysis was made through capture per unit of effort (CPUE). In Barra do Una, 20 <b>disembarkations</b> caught 282. 6 kg of 12 fish species, using 19340 m of nets, in 177. 5 hours, obtaining a yield of 0. 001 kg/m'/ hour (CPUE 1) or 1. 0526 kg/fisherman/ hour (CPUE 2). In Guarau, 607. 9 kg of 24 fish species were collected in 32 <b>disembarkations,</b> utilizing 27320 m' of nets in 246. 5 hours of fishing effort, with yields was 0. 0015 kg/m'/hour (CPUE 1) or 1. 0191 kg/fisherman/hour (CPUE 2). In spite of closeness of yield values, the <b>disembarkations</b> composition at these two villages was distinct, with only 33 % similarity (jaccard Index). A fish collection of 54 species belonging to 28 families was made...|$|R
50|$|Russian Navy Aviation managed all land, {{shore and}} vessel-based (tender {{seaplanes}} and catapult vessels) hydroplanes and aircraft, {{as well as}} flying boats. The air units also conducted land operations {{in support of the}} Red Army during landings and <b>disembarkations</b> and served in special wartime operations. Naval Aviation provided some air cover to Allied convoys bringing equipment to Soviet forces from North Sea to the Barents Sea and via the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Okhotsk.|$|R
5|$|In early April 1941, the battalion, less 'D' Company which {{travelled}} {{west for}} home leave, entrained at Oakbank, near to Woodside, South Australia {{where they had}} moved the previous February. From there, the battalion travelled overland to Sydney where they embarked upon the SS Ile de France from Pyrmont Wharf, bound for the Middle East, {{as part of a}} large convoy of troopships. Sailing via Fremantle where 'D' Company rejoined the battalion, they sailed on to Colombo, which was reached in late April, where the troopship put in for repairs and shore leave was given to all battalion personnel. Departing again in early May, they continued on alone, crossing the Red Sea in a week and making landfall at Port Tewfik. The troops had to endure a two-day wait before <b>disembarkation</b> whereupon they were taken to {{the eastern side of the}} Suez Canal by lighter and then transferred by train to Kantara.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{objectives}} of Operation Dragoon were the important French ports of Marseille and Toulon, which were considered essential {{to supply the}} growing Allied forces in France. The Allied planners were cautious, taking heed of {{lessons learned from the}} Anzio and Normandy landings. They chose a location without high ground controlled by the Wehrmacht, conditions that had led to heavy casualties after the initial landings on one of the beaches at Normandy. The choice for the <b>disembarkation</b> site was an area on the Var coast east of Toulon. A preliminary air campaign was planned to isolate the battlefield and cut the Germans off from reinforcement by destroying several key bridges. A large airborne landing was also planned {{in the center of the}} landing zone to quickly seize the high ground overlooking the beaches. Parallel to the invasion, several commando units would take control of the islands off the coast.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{late in the}} war, the {{battalion}} received orders to deploy overseas again. Boarding the Duntroon on 24 November 1944, a week later {{the battalion}} arrived at Aitape in New Guinea. There, the 6th Division took over from the American garrison in order to free up the US troops for further fighting in the Philippines. Following <b>disembarkation,</b> the 2/5th concentrated around Tadji airstrip. In December, the Australians began offensive operations against the Japanese forces that were operating in the surrounding areas. For the next seven months until the war ended the 2/5th undertook patrols through the Torricelli and Prince Alexander mountain ranges, as the 17th Brigade worked to initially establish and hold the Australian base around Aitape, before moving inland towards Maprik {{and then on to}} Kiarivu to pursue the Japanese forces that had withdrawn into the interior. Although only intended as a mopping up campaign, it was an arduous and costly period. Consisting primarily of small unit actions which resulted in disproportionately heavy casualties for the Australians, throughout the course of the campaign the 2/5th suffered 146 casualties, including eight officers killed or wounded.|$|E
50|$|Rikusentai {{units were}} grouped in battalion-level formations, {{named after the}} three naval districts, {{including}} Yokosuka. Paratroop units were only organized on the very eve of the war, beginning in September 1941. The lightly armed parachute units were intended to assault coastal areas, supporting amphibious landings or <b>disembarkations,</b> or enemy airfields and other strategic objectives. They were not meant to become entangled in heavy, pitched land battles. However, their operational use {{would prove to be}} contrary to this doctrine.|$|R
5000|$|In general, two {{passenger}} trains run daily: one a slightly slower service with more stops for locals - 15 official stops {{and more than}} 50 flag stops where boardings or <b>disembarkations</b> can be made at passenger request - {{and the other a}} direct service for tourists that is faster and more expensive. First class trains are composed of two to three cars, each holding 64 passengers. Second class trains are composed of three or four cars, each holding 68 passengers.|$|R
5000|$|During the Middle Ages Arabs {{visited the}} islands. For example, the Muslim {{navigator}} Ibn Farrukh, from Umayyad Granada, allegedly landed in [...] "Gando" [...] (Gran Canaria) in February 999, visiting a king named Guanarigato. From the 14th century onward, sailors from Mallorca, Portugal and Genoa made numerous visits. Lancelotto Malocello {{settled on the}} island of Lanzarote in 1312. The Mayorcans established a mission with a bishop that lasted from 1350 to 1400. It is from this mission that the various paintings and statues of the Virgin Mary that are currently venerated in the island were preserved. European <b>disembarkations</b> of Genovese, Castilian and Portuguese missionaries and pirates on Canarian shores became relatively common and the prehispanic populations experienced a long and ongoing process of Westernisation before formal colonization took place.|$|R
5|$|At 12:30 two {{companies}} of the Canterbury Battalion landed and {{were sent to}} support the Aucklands, who had now been ordered back to Plugge's Plateau, and were forming on {{the left of the}} 3rd Brigade. The Canterbury companies moved into the line on the Aucklands' left, waiting {{for the rest of their}} brigade to land. However, between 12:30 and 16:00 not one infantry or artillery formation came ashore. The ships carrying the New Zealanders were in the bay, but the steamers and rowing boats were being used to take the large numbers of wounded to the hospital ship. The transports with the 4th Australian Brigade on board were still well out at sea and not due to land until that evening. The landings recommenced around 16:30 when the Wellington Battalion came ashore, followed by the Otago Battalion around 17:00, who were put into the line beside the Aucklanders. Next to land were the two other Canterbury companies, who were sent north to Walker's Ridge to extend the corps left flank. Events ashore now forced a change in the <b>disembarkation</b> schedule, and at 17:50 orders were issued for the 4th Australian Brigade to start landing to boost the defence. It would take until the next day for the complete brigade to come ashore. The transports carrying both divisions' artillery batteries had been forced further out to sea by Turkish artillery fire, and were unable to land.|$|E
5|$|The River Parrett, the Bristol Channel and the Severn Estuary are {{believed}} to have been used for riverine bulk transportation of people and supplies in Somerset under Roman and later Anglo-Saxon and Norman occupation. Roman Somerset, which lasted for over 250years until around the beginning of the 5th century, had various settlements, including Bath (Aquae Sulis), Ilchester (Lindinis) and lead mines at Charterhouse; and four roads surrounding the Somerset Levels. There is evidence of two Roman ports on the Parrett. The port at Combwich, on the west bank, was ill-recorded before its destruction by quarrying and erosion. The other at Crandon Bridge on the east bank near where the current King's Sedgemoor Drain enters the Parrett, was in use between the first and the fourth centuries. Evidence of an extensive site with storehouses was found in the mid-1970s, during motorway construction works. The Crandon Bridge site may have been linked by a probable Roman road over the Polden Hills to the Fosse Way, at Ilchester. Ilchester, the largest Roman town in Somerset, was a port with large granaries, sited where the Fosse Way crossed the Ilchester Yeo by means of a paved ford. The Yeo was navigable by small craft {{all the way to the}} Parrett allowing military supplies to be brought by boat directly to Ilchester; however, <b>disembarkation</b> at Crandon Bridge and use of the Polden Hills roadway allowed more rapid movement to Ilchester. The Yeo may already have been straightened and canalised before Roman occupation.|$|E
25|$|In September 2007, Canterbury {{embarked}} 250 {{troops and}} 50 vehicles, including 20 NZLAV armoured vehicles, to test embarkation and <b>disembarkation</b> procedures.|$|E
25|$|Allied {{offensive}} {{operations were}} postponed when a severe storm hit the English Channel on 19 June, which delayed the Allied build-up {{for three days}} and left them three divisional <b>disembarkations</b> behind schedule. Operation Dreadnought, an attack from the Orne bridgehead by VIII Corps to outflank Caen from the east, was cancelled. The poor weather grounded most Allied aircraft until 23 June, allowing the Germans receive reinforcements relatively undisturbed and the equivalent of two German divisions, artillery and mortar units reached Normandy. Defensive positions were strengthened with minefields and about 70 88 mm anti-tank guns were sited in hedgerows and woods on the approaches to Caen. On 23 June, the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division attacked Ste Honorine la Chardonnerette before dawn, captured the village and then repulsed a counter-attack, destroying thirteen German tanks. Further west, VIII Corps, which had recently arrived from England, was moved into line between XXX Corps and I Corps west of Caen. Planning for an attack by VIII Corps on 26 June had begun and a preliminary attack by XXX Corps, to capture high ground in the area west of VIII Corps was arranged for 25 June.|$|R
25|$|The {{underground}} station at Waterloo was {{located within the}} existing transverse arches of the main line station, with the arrival and departure platforms in separate arches, and a staircase access. Siding accommodation and a reversing siding were provided beyond the platforms: after <b>disembarkation</b> of passengers, an arriving train would continue forward to the reversing sidings, {{and then return to}} the departure platform. An additional lay-by siding was provided later.|$|E
25|$|The Bombardier CSeries {{aircraft}} {{contains a}} high proportion of composite materials and features larger windows. The CSeries cabin features large, rotating overhead storage bins, allowing each passenger to stow a sizeable carry-on bag overhead. Bombardier claims that compared to the cabins of current in-service narrowbody aircraft, the CSeries provides airlines with the highest overhead bin volume per passenger and a wider aisle that allows for faster boarding and <b>disembarkation</b> of passengers.|$|E
25|$|The {{consequence}} {{was that}} the roadstead of Nieuwe Diep fell into British hands without a fight, providing the British and Russian invasion forces in later phases of the invasion with a more convenient <b>disembarkation</b> location. Also, a number of inactive Batavian ships of the line were an easy prey for the British, as were {{the contents of the}} naval arsenal in Den Helder. The squadron of Admiral Story was forced to move away to the roadstead of De Vlieter further east.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{deployment}} around Santiago has likewise been sternly criticized. Observers faulted Linares {{for failing}} to challenge the American <b>disembarkation</b> at Siboney altogether and Rubín for yielding the ridges at Las Guasimas—despite orders to this effect—to an American column that had failed to eject him. One historian suggested the Spaniards could not oppose the American advance without exposing themselves to a potentially devastating bombardment from long-range naval guns. The inefficacy of American naval gunfire against shore-based positions throughout the war may cast doubt on this assertion.|$|E
25|$|The {{dispute with}} the Chinese {{authorities}} was only resolved when the British Government sent an army, under Lieutenant General Sir James Hope Grant, to take the forts by overwhelming force: the Third Battle of the Taku Forts in August 1860 was an Anglo-French victory: Hope provided the covering fire for the <b>disembarkation</b> of the troops and was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 9 November 1860. He was also awarded the French Legion of Honour, Second Class on 29 October 1861.|$|E
25|$|Occupying a {{commanding}} {{position at the}} head of Portsmouth Harbour, in the medieval period Portchester was an important port. The castle saw the <b>disembarkation</b> for several campaigns to France led by England's kings. In anticipation of a French invasion during {{the first quarter of the}} 14thcentury, EdwardII spent £1,100 repairing and reinforcing Portchester Castle. A plot to overthrow HenryV was discovered and the culprits apprehended at Portchester; this event features in Shakespeare's play, HenryV. Later in its history, the castle was used as a prison.|$|E
25|$|Besides the Adelantado the {{principal}} leaders were Carlos de Arellano, Major-general Sancho Martínez de Leyva and General Admiral Diego de Brochero. Rumours were rife and long before its actual departure, reports were reaching the Spanish authorities of the <b>disembarkation</b> of their troops in O'Neill's territory. In Lisbon Cornelius O'Mulrian followed with intense interest the preparations {{of the new}} armada. According to the reports the nuncio was sending to Rome, the invasion of Ireland was imminent. He wished to dispatch O'Mulrian, together with many Jesuits and other priests to organise the Catholic restoration in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Menéndez {{placed his}} main {{reliance}} on the fort, {{and every one of}} the people he had landed now labored to throw up the earthworks and defenses, while he superintended the <b>disembarkation</b> of artillery and ammunition, supplies and tools. During the work some of Ribault's vessels appeared—they might have made a dash and captured the Spanish commander, but they merely reconnoitred, and retired to report. The work on defenses continued apace, and Menéndez, unable to compete with the French on the sea, sent off his larger vessels, retaining only some light craft.|$|E
25|$|On 22 April 1944, 181 Fd Regt moved {{south to}} the Worthing area {{as part of the}} {{concentration}} for Operation Overlord. Then on 10 June it was moved close to Tilbury Docks ready for embarkation in two Liberty ships, which sailed on 12 and 13 June, arriving off Arromanches-les-Bains on the evening of 15 June (D + 9). <b>Disembarkation</b> was disrupted by a storm: 178 and 179 Btys were landed by 19 June, but RHQ and 177 Bty could not get ashore, at another beach, until 21 June, and then without guns and most of their equipment.|$|E
25|$|Private motorcars were {{starting}} to become {{more common in the}} 1920s, but were initially more of a danger to tram passengers than to the business of the Board. As many tramlines ran down the middle of a road, it was common to hail a tram by walking out into the road, which became more dangerous with the faster moving motorcars. Also, traffic behind a tram that had stopped to allow for the embarkation or <b>disembarkation</b> of passengers was only able to pass between the tram and curb, right into the path of passengers moving between the tram and footpath.|$|E
25|$|A Dutch {{fleet of}} 36 ships under Admiral Willem Corneliszoon Loos and Vice Adm. Jacob Huygens emerged from Recife and intercepted the Spanish-Portuguese fleet between Itamaracá and Goiana on 12 January, before any attempt of <b>disembarkation</b> could be effected. The battle {{degenerated}} in a confused melee in which Loos lost 2 of his vessels,while Loos himself was killed aboard his flagship, while confronting Mascarenhas flagship. Some Dutch ships managed to approach and disengage {{it from the}} Spanish flagship, but the vessel sank, taking down the admiral. Another Dutch ship, the Alemar, was riddled by the Spanish guns and nearly sank, being unable to continue the pursuit.|$|E
25|$|On the 102nd {{floor of}} the Empire State Building (formerly the 101st floor), there is a door with stairs {{ascending}} to the 103rd floor (formerly the 102nd). This was built as a <b>disembarkation</b> floor for airships tethered to the building's spire, and has a circular balcony outside. It is now an access point to reach the spire for maintenance. The room now contains electrical equipment, but celebrities and dignitaries may also be given permission to take pictures there. Above the 103rd floor, there {{is a set of}} stairs and a ladder to reach the spire for maintenance work. The mast's 480 windows were all replaced in 2015.|$|E
25|$|India's {{relationship}} with Burma had been strained after the 1962 Military coup {{followed by the}} repatriation of many Indian families in 1964 by Burma. While the central government in New Delhi monitored the overall process of repatriation and arranged for identification and transportation of the Indian returnees from Burma, it fell under the responsibilities of local governments to provide adequate facilities to shelter the repatriates upon <b>disembarkation</b> on Indian soil. Particularly in the Madras State the Chief Minister during that time, Minjur K. Bhaktavatsalam, showed care in rehabilitation of the returnees. In December 1965 Shastri made an official visit with his Family to Rangoon, Burma and re-established cordial relations with the country's military government of General Ne Win.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 11 October, a {{reconnaissance}} flight over the University however revealed that the football field- the designated drop-zone- {{may be unable to}} accommodate four helicopters in a single wave. Holding off outside the dropzone in the face of expected hostile fire was ruled out and a change in the plans saw the decision made to divide each wave into two flights of a pair of Mi-8s. The second flight was to leave Palay Airfield- about four minutes flying time from the drop zone- only after the first flights had started on their return leg after <b>disembarkation</b> of their contingent. The whole operation was expected to last for ninety minutes.|$|E
25|$|Originating {{primarily}} {{from what was}} known as the Bight of Biafra on the West African coast, Igbo people were taken in relatively high numbers to Jamaica {{as a result of the}} Transatlantic Slave Trade, beginning around 1750. The primary ports from which the majority of these enslaved people were taken from were Bonny and Calabar, two port towns that are now in south-eastern Nigeria. The slave ships arriving from Bristol and Liverpool delivered the slaves to British colonies including Jamaica. The bulk of enslaved Igbo people arrived relatively late, between 1790 and 1807. Jamaica, after Virginia, was the second most common <b>disembarkation</b> point for slave ships arriving from the Bight of Biafra.|$|E
25|$|In June 1949, the {{regiment}} moved to Greece {{during the civil}} war in that country. In October 1951, following a short period in Cyprus, {{the regiment}} deployed to the British-controlled Suez Canal Zone in Egypt. There, the regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Peter Young, saw active service performing internal security duties. The regiment, following <b>disembarkation,</b> was based for several days at a Transit Camp at Port Said and then moved to Gordon Camp at El Ballah. The regiment moved to Suez the following year. The Colonel Commandant of the regiment General Sir Bernard Paget visited the regiment in November 1952. The regiment left Suez in April 1953. At the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June 1953 the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry guard of honour was commanded by Captain Tod Sweeney.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the natural}} layout of the harbour, Ilfracombe became a {{significant}} safe port (registered port of refuge) on the Bristol Channel. It also had trade routes between Kinsale and Tenby, which made the port stronger. In 1208 it was listed as having provided King John with ships and men to invade Ireland; in 1247 it supplied a ship to the fleet that was sent to conquer the Western Isles of Scotland; 6 ships, with 79 men were sent to support the siege of Calais. Ilfracombe was the last <b>disembarkation</b> point for two large forces sent to subdue the Irish. The building which sits on Lantern Hill by the harbour, known as St Nicholas's Chapel (built 1361) is reputed to be the oldest working lighthouse in the UK; a light/beacon {{has been there for}} over 650 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasion}} {{met with}} early success. The depleted Dutch fleet, under Rear-Admiral Samuel Story, evaded battle, leaving the <b>disembarkation</b> of the British troops near Callantsoog on 27 August 1799, unopposed. General Daendels {{was defeated in}} the battle of Callantsoog when he tried to prevent the establishment of a bridgehead by the division under General Abercromby. This was {{due to the fact that}} he was forced to divide his forces, because of the nature of the field of battle, a narrow band of dunes, bordered by the North-Sea beach on one side, and a swamp on the other. Due to communication problems, his right wing was never fully engaged, and the forces of his left wing were fed piecemeal into the battle. The British made very good use of the support their gunboats could offer from close inshore. The naval gunfire inflicted heavy losses on the Dutch.|$|E
25|$|Before this council started, {{the crew}} of the Washington had already begun a full mutiny, refusing to man the guns, and {{throwing}} munitions into the sea. Attempts of Story himself, and Van Braam to reason with the mutineers had been of no avail. When asked during the council of war to describe the situation aboard their ships all, except Captain Van Senden of Batavier, had similar stories. In these circumstances it seemed impossible to engage in battle. Besides, the officers calculated that their continued resistance would contribute little to the fight against the invasion, as the <b>disembarkation</b> had already taken place. Scuttling the fleet seemed impossible, because the crews would not allow it. Finally, some calculated {{that it would be better}} to surrender without resistance, because in that case the ships would end up in the possession of the Stadtholder, instead of becoming war booty for the British.|$|E
25|$|Following {{this the}} {{battalion}} remained with the 8th Brigade in New Guinea undertaking garrison duties, based around the Madang–Hansa Bay area. In August 1945, the Japanese announced their surrender and the fighting came to end. At this time, the 35th Battalion {{was sent to}} Wewak where they began the demobilisation process. During this time {{a large number of}} the battalion's personnel were either repatriated to Australia or transferred to other units for subsequent service. Finally, on 24 January 1946, the remaining personnel embarked upon the troopship Ormiston. The battalion was disbanded shortly after their <b>disembarkation</b> in Australia. During the war, the battalion lost 17 men killed in action or died on active service, while another 18 men were wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Military Medal and 12 Mentions in Despatches. For its service during the war, the 35th was awarded three battle honours in 1961.|$|E
