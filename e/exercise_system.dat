40|$|There {{has been}} a vast {{research}} interest in <b>exercise</b> tracking <b>systems</b> as they are hoped to boost motivation for exercise and thus improve users’ health. However, research activity on actual use and experiences on using such systems has been mild: one has been {{more interested in the}} consequences of use than the use itself. To address this gap, we report a study, in which we examined the use of <b>exercise</b> tracking <b>systems</b> (i. e. physical devices with connected services and information systems) in their contexts of use. The study was based on diary data collected in Finland. Analysis of the data was based on a framework describing various techno-determinant inhibitors and enablers of technology use.

Therefore, as a theoretical contribution, to capture the whole diversity of <b>exercise</b> tracking <b>systems</b> use, we supplemented the framework with two new categories, social and self. The results are discussed in the light of motivational factors of technology use, social participation and the evolving role of information technology as it comes pervasive and ubiquitous. <b>Exercise</b> tracking <b>system</b> providers may utilise our context-specific findings to improve their products and services...|$|R

40|$|Regular {{physical}} activity {{reduces the risk}} of many diseases and improves physical and mental health. However, physical inactivity is widespread globally. Improving {{physical activity}} levels is a global concern in well-being management. <b>Exercise</b> performance measurement <b>systems</b> have the potential to improve physical activity by providing feedback and motivation to users. We propose an <b>exercise</b> performance measurement <b>system</b> for well-being management that is based on the accumulated activity effective index (AAEI) and incorporates a smartphone-embedded sensor. The proposed system generates a numeric index that is based on users’ exercise performance: their level of physical activity and number of days spent exercising.

We implemented the <b>exercise</b> performance measurement <b>system</b> by using a smartphone and conducted experiments to assess the feasibility of the system and investigated the user experience.

Also Smederevo Gymnastics and Combat Association {{in the course of}} time chose the falcon <b>exercising</b> <b>system.</b> The aim of this research was to find, systemize and critically analyze data about the falconry in Smederevo, about the falcon association 'Dusan Silni' (Dusan the Mighty), which as a successor continued the activities of the previous association - Smederevo Gymnastics and Combat Association. The basic assumption was founded on the expectation that data from the archive, periodical sources and ex falcon legacy would provide a satisfying base for reconstruction of Falcon Association history, i. e. appearance and development of the Falconry in Smederevo.
