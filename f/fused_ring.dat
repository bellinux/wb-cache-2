2500|$|Many {{derivatives}} of quinuclidine such as quinuclidine amide {{are known}} to be α7 nAChR agonists. SAR studies for quinuclidine amide have identified factors that are affecting the potency and affinity of these agonists. Para substitution on the quinuclidine ring and the 3-(R) configuration in the stereochemistry is favored. Enhanced activity is observed when a 5 membered ring is fused to aromatic moiety. Further enhancement is seen when the <b>fused</b> <b>ring</b> is able to supply electron resonance to the amide carbonyl whereas the activity will diminish when the <b>fused</b> <b>ring</b> contains a hydrogen bond donating atom. The rigidity of quinuclidine and the orthogonal orientation of the nitrogen bridge in relations to the amide carbonyl group is presumed important for the optimal binding.
