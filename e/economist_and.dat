5|$|Born in Paris on 10 March 1782, Villermé {{was a man}} of many occupations; {{he covered}} a wide range of professions in his {{lifetime}} including: medical student, army surgeon, author, social <b>economist,</b> <b>and</b> member of several medical boards. He studied with the anatomist Guillaume Dupuytren during 1801–1804. Villermé then spent 10 years serving in the army room during 1804–1814 under the reign of Napoleon.

5|$|In 1999, then-President Hugo Sonnenschein {{announced}} plans to relax the university's famed core curriculum, {{reducing the number of}} required courses from 21 to 15.

The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein's decision to resign in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Louis-René Villermé (10 March 1782 – 16 November 1863) was a French <b>economist</b> <b>and</b> physician. He {{was known}} for his early studies of social epidemiology, or the effects of {{socioeconomic}} status on health, in early industrial France, and was an advocate for hygienic reform in factories and prisons. His work is considered pivotal {{in the history of the}} fields of sociology and statistical inquiry, and he is considered a founder of epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|Romanian American {{economist}} Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor {{in economics}} and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, {{has argued that}} the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use. Leading ecological <b>economist</b> <b>and</b> steady-state theorist Herman Daly, a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has propounded the same argument.|$|E
5|$|The National Health Service (NHS) is the {{publicly}} funded healthcare system in England {{responsible for providing}} the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect {{the provisions of the}} National Health Service Act 1946. It was based on the findings of the Beveridge Report, prepared by <b>economist</b> <b>and</b> social reformer William Beveridge. The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including National Insurance payments, and it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Piketty, French <b>economist</b> <b>and</b> {{author of}} the bestselling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century regards taxes on capital as a more {{favorable}} option than austerity (inefficient and unjust) and inflation (only affects cash but neither real estates nor business capital). According to his analysis, a flat tax of 15 percent on private wealth would provide the state with nearly a year's worth national income, which would allow for immediate reimbursement of the entire public debt.|$|E

5|$|Walker {{was born}} in Boston, Massachusetts, the {{youngest}} son of Hanna (née Ambrose) and Amasa Walker, a prominent <b>economist</b> <b>and</b> state politician. The Walkers had three children, Emma (born 1835), Robert (born 1837), and Francis. Because the Walkers' next-door neighbor was Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., the junior Walker and junior Holmes were playmates as young children and renewed their friendship later in life. The family moved from Boston to North Brookfield, Massachusetts, in 1843 and remained there. As a boy he had both a noted temper {{as well as a}} magnetic personality.|$|E
40|$|<b>Economists</b> <b>and</b> ecologists, in general, {{have offered}} differing {{opinions}} about the seriousness of climate change {{and the need for}} rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Economists have tended to urge caution, focusing on the potential for large-scale cutbacks to upset the economy. Ecologists have tended to focus on the potential for catastrophic losses from climate change, and have urged extensive shifts in policy. This paper uses the tools of cost benefit analysis and the decision sciences to examine why members of the two disciplines often reach different conclusions. First, <b>economists</b> <b>and</b> ecologists start from different perspectives about {{what is the point of}} reference against which policies should be judged. Second, <b>economists</b> <b>and</b> ecologists tend to apply different discount rates to future impacts of climate change. Third, <b>economists</b> <b>and</b> ecologists are likely to interpret differently the substantive findings and expressed uncertainties of formal cost-benefit analysis. Using a [...] ...|$|R

5|$|American <b>economist</b> <b>and</b> former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued}} that the lack of global {{consensus}} on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He {{has argued that}} quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Hastings became {{involved}} in the Savidge Inquiry. Sir Leo Chiozza Money was a noted journalist, <b>economist</b> <b>and</b> former Liberal MP. On 23 April 1928, he and Miss Irene Savidge were sitting in Hyde Park in London when they were arrested by two plain-clothes police officers and taken to the nearest police station, where they were charged under the Parks Regulation Act 1872 with committing an indecent offence. The next morning, they were remanded for a week at Great Marlborough Street Police Court. At the next hearing a week later, the case was dismissed by the magistrate, who criticised the police for failing to contact a man seen running through the park to establish some kind of corroborative evidence, and failing to report at once to Scotland Yard to avoid having to charge the defendants immediately.|$|E
5|$|Innis got {{his first}} taste of {{university}} teaching at Chicago, where he delivered several introductory economics courses.

Mary Quayle Innis was herself a notable <b>economist</b> <b>and</b> writer. Her book, An Economic History of Canada, was published in 1935. Her novel, Stand on a Rainbow appeared in 1943.

He received a commission to join the 15th Massachusetts Infantry and quickly rose through the ranks as an assistant adjutant general. Walker fought in the Peninsula Campaign and was wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville but subsequently participated in the Bristoe, Overland, and Richmond-Petersburg Campaigns before being captured by Confederate forces and held at the infamous Libby Prison. In July 1866, he was nominated by President Andrew Johnson and confirmed by the United States Senate for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general United States Volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, when he was age 24.|$|E
5|$|Former World Bank Chief <b>Economist</b> <b>and</b> former Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph E. Stiglitz {{referred}} in {{the late}} 1990s to a growing consensus {{that something is wrong}} with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great {{number of people who are}} hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies.|$|E
