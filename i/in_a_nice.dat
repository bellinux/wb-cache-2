25|$|Muncie {{played in}} the Pro Bowl after the 1979 season with the Saints and was {{selected}} as the Most Valuable Player of the game. He was the first Saints player named to the Pro Bowl and also was the first Saints player ever to reach the 1,000-yard rushing plateau when he ran for a then-team record of 1,198 yards in 1979. Coming from the tolerant environment in Berkeley, it was a culture shock for Muncie in New Orleans, where his house and car were regularly vandalized by racists despite his living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> neighborhood. He frequently expressed his unhappiness in New Orleans. Saints coach Dick Nolan grew tired of Muncie being late for meetings and practices. After the Saints began the 1980 season with an 0–4 record, they traded Muncie to the 4–0 San Diego Chargers.|$|E

Julia was eventually forced to hand the care of Lennon over to Mimi and George, who had no children of their own. Lennon then lived continuously at Mendips, in the smallest bedroom above the front door. Lennon later talked about Mendips and the area around it: [...] "I lived in the suburbs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> semi-detached place with a small garden and doctors and lawyers and that ilk living around... not the poor slummy kind of image that was projected in all The Beatles' stories".|$|E

The authors also praised Krusty's [...] "ponytail and black sweater" [...] look. In the DVD audio commentary for [...] "The Last Temptation of Krust", Leno said that he believed the essence of comedy clubs was depicted {{very well in the}} episode and referred to Krusty's remodeled appearance as [...] " [...] Carlin post-Vegas act". He also appreciated Krusty's poke at Leno's use of news headlines on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and said that he could not figure out whether parts of the episode were making fun of him or complimenting him.

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} critical acclaim from critics.

[...] Mrs. Northman of television website, TV Fanatic said [...] "Overall, [...] "Hello Goodbye" [...] did wrap up each of our beloved characters lives <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> pretty bow", they added [...] "We wanted MORE!" [...] The day after the episode's U.S. airing, {{a reporter for the}} British newspaper Daily Mail praised Betty's transformation saying [...] "Gone were the thick-rimmed glasses and braces that once defined America Ferrera's character, and in its place a professional career woman signalling the completion of a four-year metamorphosis." [...] However, some critics felt the ending of the episode was not enough. Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald gave the episode a mixed review saying it was [...] "like one long hug with loved ones you don't want to leave," [...] but added the conclusion was [...] "unsatisfying". New York magazine said [...] "The cast of Ugly Betty damn well earned a happy ending — and that's exactly what creator Silvio Horta gave them last night on the series finale". However, they also found the conclusion to be unsatisfying saying [...] "The one-hour finale easily could have been longer, meaning some plotlines went unresolved." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post said [...] "Last night, Ugly Betty attempted to earn a place in TV history, but I fear their last episode will be quickly forgotten by the fans". Wieselman also added [...] "On a show that always favored high drama and cool camp, I was saddened to see everyone get such an expected ending". Wieselman, however, did enjoy the final scene calling it [...] "pitch-perfect".|$|E
500|$|On 31 August 2016, the {{deadline}} {{day for the}} summer transfer window, {{it was announced that}} Balotelli had joined OGC Nice on a free transfer, after signing on a one-year deal. In an interview leading up to his Nice debut on 11 September, Balotelli told Canal Plus that joining Liverpool in the summer of 2014 was the [...] "worst mistake of his life" [...] and that Brendan Rodgers and Jürgen Klopp (the two Liverpool managers during Balotelli's time at the club) did not make a good impression on him and he did not get along with them. He made his debut for Nice, starting in a home Ligue 1 match against Marseille, converting a penalty in the 7th minute and scoring a header from Ricardo's cross in the 78th minute as Nice won the match 3–2. On 21 September, Balotelli, in only his second Ligue 1 appearance, struck another double in the 30th and 68th minutes as Nice thrashed Monaco 4–0 in the Azurean derby at the Allianz Riviera to go to the top of Ligue 1. No other player had scored four goals in their first two Ligue 1 matches in the last 25 years. On 29 September, Balotelli scored his fifth goal in just four competitive matches for Nice when he fired home a right-footed shot from just outside the penalty area in the 43rd minute after an assist from Malang Sarr in a 2016–17 UEFA Europa League Group I match against Krasnodar in an eventual 5–2 away defeat. That was his first goal in a UEFA club competition since February 2015, when he scored for Liverpool against Beşiktaş in the round of 32 of the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League knockout phase. On 2 October, Balotelli scored the winning goal in the 86th minute by sending a powerful kick {{from the edge of the}} box into the top right corner as Nice defeated Lorient 2–1 in a home Ligue 1 match, during which he received a yellow card for taking off his shirt in celebration of his goal and was subsequently sent off minutes later in stoppage time after receiving a second, controversial yellow card, following an altercation with Lorient's Steven Moreira, where neither player appeared to do anything wrong. Balotelli's red card was rescinded four days later after referee Olivier Thual's admission that he had made a mistake in showing Balotelli the second yellow card and the French Football League's Disciplinary Commission decided to annul his second yellow card, thus allowing him to be available for the following league match. On 21 December, he received his first official red card <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> shirt in a 0–0 Ligue 1 away draw with Girondins de Bordeaux for kicking Igor Lewczuk.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most direct}} effect of {{residential}} inequality is an inequality of neighborhood amenities. [...] Neighborhood amenities include {{factors such as}} the conditions of surrounding houses, the availability of social networks, the amount of air pollution, the crime rate, and the quality of local schools. [...] A neighborhood with a certain quality of amenities typically includes individual residences of corresponding quality. It follows then that those with lower incomes usually end up living in areas with poor amenities in order to win the spatial competition for housing. [...] Apart from the intrinsic value of neighborhood amenities like the satisfaction derived from living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> area, many studies suggest that growing up in a high poverty neighborhood affects social and economic outcomes later in life.|$|E

2500|$|The {{departure}} of founding member Bruce Gilbert in 2006 left Wire as a trio composed of Colin Newman (vocals, guitar, various), Graham Lewis (bass, vocals, various) and Robert Grey (drums). Having released Object 47 in 2008, the band had {{originally intended to}} record Red Barked Tree in December 2009, at Githead and Wire soundman Frankie Lievaart's studio in Rotterdam. When Lievaart proved unable to trace, having left the country with Gogol Bordello, the only alternative would have been Newman's swim~ studio, but as Newman explained to emusic.com, this {{would not have been}} suitable: [...] "I can produce fairly decent-sounding mixes here , but for physical recording, if you're going to record drums <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> room, first of all you've got to have a nice room, and someone who knows how to record drums. If you're going to record a whole band, you've got to have the right place to do it." [...] Their preferred option not being available, the band therefore decided to book four days in a commercial studio in London, which put the recording date back to February 2010.|$|E
