40|$|The {{applicability}} of time temperature integrators (TTI) as effective tools of chill chain monitoring was assessed. Validated kinetic models of pseudomonads growth of Mediterranean, marine-cultured chilled <b>gilt-head</b> <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> <b>aurata)</b> and full {{knowledge of the}} response of suitable enzymatic TTI are {{the basis of the}} TTI application algorithm. This scheme was evaluated through a controlled field test of exported fish, from harvest to final consumption. Response of TTI attached on different locations of packages was compared to actual temperature recording. Data that could not be obtained during the actual field test, such as microbiological or sensory tests of fish at intermediate points of the chain, were measured in a replicate laboratory study, simulating the handling of products and the real time-temperature profiles of the field test. The conducted field tests showed the applicability and usefulness of TTI monitoring of the fish chill chain, elucidating also the practical difficulties and limitations, {{that need to be addressed}} for expanding TTI use as a reliable management tool.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of the natural microflora of Mediterannean <b>gilt-head</b> <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> <b>aurata)</b> was monitored during aerobic storage at different isothermal conditions from 0 to 15 °C. The growth data of pseudomonads, established as the specific spoilage organisms of aerobically stored <b>gilt-head</b> <b>seabream,</b> combined with data from previously published experiments, were used to model the effect of temperature on pseudomonad growth using a Belehradek type model. The nominal minimum temperature parameters of the Belehradek model (Tmin) for the maximum specific growth rate (μmax) and the lag phase (tLag) were determined to be − 11. 8 and − 12. 8 °C, respectively. The applicability of the model in predicting pseudomonad growth on fish at fluctuating temperatures was evaluated by comparing predictions with observed growth in experiments under dynamic conditions. Temperature scenarios designed in the laboratory and simulation of real temperature profiles observed in the fish chill chain were used. Bias and accuracy factors were used as comparison indices and ranged from 0. 91 to 1. 17 and from 1. 11 to 1. 17, respectively. The average percent difference between shelf life predicted based on pseudomonad growth and shelf life experimentally determined by sensory analysis for all temperature profiles tested was 5. 8 %, indicating that the model is able to predict accurately fish quality in real-world conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{main source}} of calcium {{carbonate}} (CaCO 3) in the ocean comes from the shells of calcifying planktonic organisms, but substantial amounts of CaCO 3 are also produced in fish intestines. The precipitation of CaCO 3 assists fish in intestinal water absorption and aids in whole body Ca 21 homeostasis. Here we report that the product formed in the intestinal lumen of the <b>gilt-head</b> <b>seabream,</b> <b>Sparus</b> <b>aurata,</b> is an amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) phase. With FTIR spectroscopy and SEM imaging, our study shows that the fish-derived carbonates from S. aurata are maintained as a stable amorphous phase throughout the intestinal tract. Moreover, intestinal deposits contained up to 54 mol%Mg 21, the highest concentration yet reported in biogenic ACC. Mg ismost likely responsible for stabilizing this inherently unstablemineral. The fish carbonates also displayed initial rapid dissolution when exposed to seawater, exhibiting {{a significant increase in}} carbonate concentration. E lemental production and cycling in our oceans are among the most important processes in the support of marine life. Elements such as Ca 21 and Mg 21, in addition to their substantial contribution to marine sediments, are used biologically in vital cellular processes and in the mineralization of skeletons and shells, made of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) 1. Oceanic production of CaCO 3 is usually attributed to the shells of marin...|$|R
40|$|Phenols are plant {{metabolites}} characterised {{by several}} interesting bioactive properties such as antioxidant and bactericidal activities. In this study {{the application of}} a phenols concentrate (PC) from olive vegetation water to two different fresh products – <b>gilt-head</b> <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> <b>aurata)</b> and chicken breast – was described. Products were treated in a bath of PC (22 g/L; chicken breast) or sprayed with two different solutions (L 1 : 0. 75 and L 2 : 1. 5 mg/mL; seabream) and then stored under refrigeration conditions. The shelf life was monitored through microbiological analyses – quality index method for seabream and a specific sensory index for raw breast. The secondary products of lipid-peroxidation of the chicken breast were determined using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) test on cooked samples. Multivariate statistical techniques were adopted to investigate the impact of phenols and microbiological data were fitted by DMfit software. In seabream, the levels of PC did not highlight any significant difference on microbiological and sensory features. DMfit models suggested an effect only on H 2 S producing bacteria with an increased lag phase compared to the control samples (C: 87 h vs L 2 : 136 h). The results on chicken breast showed that the PC bath clearly modified the growth of Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. The phenol dipping was effective in limiting lipid-peroxidation (TBARs) after cooking. Treated samples disclosed an increase of shelf life of 2 days. These could be considered as preliminary findings suggesting the use of this concentrate as preservative in some fresh products...|$|R

Male gilthead <b>seabream,</b> <b>Sparus</b> <b>aurata</b> specimens were exposed for 20 days via water {{to a series of}} high B(a) P concentrations. CYP 1 A was assessed by measuring enzymatic activity (EROD) and CYP 1 A protein content, and cellular responses were evaluated by routine histopathological methods. In addition, biliary metabolites were measured in order to verify that B(a) P was absorbed and metabolised. Histological lesions, both in liver and gills, increased in parallel to B(a) P concentrations, with the majority of changes representing rather non-specific alterations. Hepatic EROD and CYP 1 A proteins data showed a concentration-dependent induction, while in the gills, EROD activity but not CYP 1 A proteins showed a non-monotonous dose response, with a maximum induction level at 200 microg B(a) P.

40|$|Liquid ice or binary ice is a {{new food}} {{chilling}} technique that requires less time to chill products and acts more uniformly than other types of ice. The practical advantage of binary ice is its pumpability. Moreover, {{on account of the}} microscopic size of the ice crystals, the main benefit of binary ice is its ability for rapid chilling of fish and to provide lower fish temperature, which in turn slows down both enzymatic and bacterial spoilage activity and hence maintains the fish in better quality. Gilthead <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> <b>aurata)</b> {{is one of the main}} species farmed in the Mediterranean area and its production has undergone a huge increase in recent years, reaching more than 50 % of the total production of all marine farmed fish. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of slaughtering by immersion in liquid ice on the quality of gilthead <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> <b>aurata)</b> vs the commercial slaughter method by immersion in ice plus water. Quality was estimated by physico-chemical and sensory parameters immediately after death and during ice storage. Liquid ice reduced the time taken by fish until complete immobilisation; however the lowest temperature (≅- 2. 2 °C) attained by the liquid ice tank caused the appearance of cloudy eyes that significantly reduces the commercial value of the fish. © Springer-Verlag 2001.

40|$|In {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and commercially important fish, gilthead <b>seabream</b> <b>Sparus</b> <b>aurata</b> L., we have studied sublethal effects of malathion {{in order to}} identify early warning bioindicators of exposure before irreversible damage occurs. To achieve this goal, groups of 10 juvenile specimens were exposed for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h to a sublethal concentration of malathion (0. 4 mg/l). Another group was used as control. The activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) and histopathological features from exposed gills were assessed. It should also be mentioned that no mortality was observed during the whole experience. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were altered significantly from 24 h onward (p< 0. 05). It is of interest to note that catalase activity was decreased after exposure instead of increasing as other antioxidant enzymes assessed. On the other hand, histopathological alterations of the gills were observed as early as at 48 h-exposure, but the most severe damage occurred at 96 h exposure. The evidence presented here, together with other data from the literature, unequivocally established oxidative-stress-inducing effects of malathion in gilthead <b>seabream</b> <b>Sparus</b> <b>aurata.</b> It is also concluded antioxidants employed (SOD, CAT and GPX) changed significantly a long time before histopathological alterations of gills became evident.
