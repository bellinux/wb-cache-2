5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
25|$|Throughout his adventures, Zhang Wuji {{finds himself}} {{entangled}} {{in a complex}} web of love relationships with four maidens. The first, Yin Li, is a horribly disfigured girl who is actually his maternal cousin. The second, Xiaozhao, is a Chinese-Persian servant girl who understands <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>well.</b> The third, Zhou Zhiruo, is a childhood friend whom he develops a strong bond with. The fourth, Zhao Min, is a Mongol princess and his former arch-rival. Yin Li is apparently killed {{in the middle of}} the novel while Xiaozhao returns to Persia after it is revealed that she is destined to lead the Persian Ming Cult.|$|E
25|$|During the inter-war period, Cecil Howard {{shared his}} time between France, England and the United States, {{producing}} {{some of his most}} important and creative works. After World War I, he received a commission to create two war memorials in Normandy. Several of his pieces were acquired by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, while Henry Luce also commissioned works from <b>him.</b> <b>Very</b> <b>well</b> acquainted with most of the Parisian art world, Howard occasionally socialised with his French fellow sculptors Charles Despiau, Antoine Bourdelle, and particularly Aristide Maillol. In 1925 the Whitney Studio Galleries of New York presented the first American exhibition dedicated exclusively to Cecil Howard's works. Taking part in several international traveling art shows, like the Tri-National Art Exhibit, he also participated in the Century of Progress fair in Chicago in 1933, and was awarded two Grand Prix in the Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne in 1937.|$|E
60|$|It was Westover {{who drove}} to meet Jeff at the station, {{when he got}} his despatch, naming the train he would take, and he found <b>him</b> looking <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> and perhaps stouter than he had been.|$|R
50|$|His boisterous {{character}} made <b>him</b> not <b>very</b> <b>well</b> {{loved by}} many, but his {{loyalty to the}} Royal family favoured {{his relationship with the}} King. Clarendon was amazed at the flood of tears the King shed, when he received the news that Berkeley had been killed.|$|R

500|$|On {{his seventh}} birthday, Gloucester {{attended}} a ceremony at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, to install {{him as a}} knight of the Order of the Garter, an honour the King had given him six months before. Gloucester became ill during the celebratory banquet afterwards and left early, but after his recovery went deer hunting in Windsor Great Park, where he was [...] by Samuel Masham, his father's page. Princess Anne wrote to the Countess of Marlborough, [...] "My boy continues yet very well, and looks better, I think, than ever he did in his life; I mean more healthy, for though I love <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> I can't brag of his beauty." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1957, Drake {{was sent}} to Eagle House School, a preparatory {{boarding}} school in Berkshire. Five years later, he went to Marlborough College, a public school in Wiltshire, attended by his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He developed an interest in sport, becoming an accomplished sprinter over 100 and 200 yards, representing the school's Open Team in 1966. He played rugby for the C1 House team and was appointed a House Captain in his last two terms. School friends recall Drake at this time as having been confident and [...] "quietly authoritative", while often aloof in his manner. His father Rodney remembered, [...] "In one of his reports [...] said {{that none of us}} seemed to know <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>well.</b> All the way through with Nick. People didn't know him very much." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{calls an}} {{emergency}} meeting asking everyone {{to come up}} with an idea to [...] "re-invigorate" [...] the office. Michael asks Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) for ideas, but Stanley is preoccupied with a crossword puzzle and says he's busy. Michael keeps asking him, and Stanley finally snaps at Michael, and says the titular [...] "Did I stutter?" [...] in a very loud, threatening tone. Michael, who is visibly shaken, ends the meeting. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) encourages Michael to take disciplinary action against Stanley, and Michael, initially resistant, decides to pretend to fire him to teach him a lesson. Michael first tells everyone in the office that he is not really firing him, and does so in front of all of them. Stanley responds by threatening to sue him and tell corporate of Michael's antics. When Michael tells Stanley that the firing was actually an attempt at teaching him a lesson, Stanley is angered and goes on a rant, yelling and insulting Michael. Michael suddenly barks at him to stop it, and tells everyone to leave the office, making everyone think he is about to berate Stanley. The camera crew sneak back in to film the exchange, where Michael tearfully (much to Stanley's annoyance) but calmly asks Stanley why he picks on him. Stanley states that he simply does not respect him, and when Michael suggests that Stanley does not know <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> he replies [...] "Michael, I've known you for a very long time. And the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you." [...] Michael then takes an uncharacteristically professional tone with Stanley, and says that, while he accepts that Stanley does not respect him, he cannot take such a disrespectful tone with him, because he is his boss. Stanley responds by saying, [...] "Fair enough," [...] and the two shake hands.|$|E

Now, when you first come 'ere, three months ago, I says to meself: [...] "He'll enjoy this 'ere for a bit, but she's {{too much of a}} lady for 'im." [...] What 'e wants about 'im {{permanent}} is a woman that thinks an' talks about all them things he talks about. And sometimes I fancy 'e don't want nothin' permanent about 'im at all.|$|R

2500|$|The story's narrator, Montresor, tells an {{unspecified}} person, who knows <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> {{of the day}} he took his revenge on Fortunato (Italian for [...] "the fortunate one"), a fellow nobleman.

2500|$|Koizumi was {{at certain}} points in his tenure an {{extremely}} popular leader. Most people know <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> {{due to his}} trademark wavy grey hair. His outspoken nature and colourful past contributed to that; his nicknames included [...] "Lionheart", due to his hair style and fierce spirit, and [...] "Maverick". During his tenure in office, the Japanese public referred to him as Jun-chan (the suffix [...] "chan" [...] in the Japanese language {{is used as a}} term of familiarity, typically between children, [...] "Jun" [...] is a contraction of Junichiro). In June 2001, he enjoyed an approval rating of 85 percent.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I suppose so. I don't think there's much {{between his}} heart and his manners. They {{seem to have been}} put on him instead of having come out of <b>him.</b> He's <b>very</b> <b>well</b> trained, and nine times out of ten he's so exquisitely polite that it's wonderful; but the tenth time he may say {{something}} so rude that you can't believe it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Walton {{comments}} that [...] "The {{most interesting thing}} about this volume is Lord Clonfert, an Irish peer who feels the need to outdo everyone—his surgeon says {{at one point that}} if Jack is the dashing frigate captain, Clonfert has to be the dashing frigate captain to the power of ten. He’s ridiculous, he lies, but he is brave and does know the waters. And for once we hear Stephen and Jack discuss him, because he’s not a shipmate so Stephen doesn’t feel like an informer talking about him. He’s a psychological curiosity without any doubt, and O’Brian does <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>well.</b> There’s also the flogging Captain Corbett—so among his little fleet there’s one dandy and one tartar, and Jack has to try to manage them diplomatically." ...|$|E

6000|$|Rachel {{looked at}} <b>him</b> <b>very</b> strangely--I can't <b>well</b> {{describe}} how--while he was speaking. When he had done, she said, [...] "Considering that Mr. Luker {{is only a}} chance acquaintance of yours, you take up his cause, Godfrey, rather warmly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait!" [...] he said, with awful calm. [...] "Wait till to-morrow night! I'll show <b>him!</b> Went <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> did he? Ha! Took eleven calls, did he? Oh, ha, ha!

6000|$|... "Aye, that he is. Look here;" [...] and {{he pointed}} to a slim steel handle some three inches long, {{projecting}} over the region of the heart. [...] "You must have searched <b>him</b> <b>very</b> carelessly, Chester. <b>Well,</b> bring him in now." ...|$|R

60|$|Arnold {{interrupted}} her almost roughly. A keen pang of remorse assailed <b>him.</b> He knew <b>very</b> <b>well</b> {{that if she}} had not been intuitively conscious of some change in him, the thought which prompted her words would never have entered her brain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Was I there!" [...] he cried. Then he checked, and {{abruptly}} {{changed his}} tone. [...] "Oh, yes, I was there," [...] he said, as commonplace as he could, beset {{by a sudden}} reluctance to avow that he had so willingly descended to depths that she must account unworthy, and grateful that his disguise of face and voice should have proved impenetrable even to one who knew <b>him</b> so <b>very</b> <b>well.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{found the}} {{squirrel}} {{here in the}} woods, and then went down to tell Espy, and we bought the squirrel of him.
