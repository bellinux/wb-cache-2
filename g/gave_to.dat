40|$|I use {{data from}} the South African Social <b>Giving</b> Survey <b>to</b> {{investigate}} the role of social capital and motivations for <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> formal charities and beggars. Results suggest that both impure altruism and inequality aversion positively influence <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> formal charities {{but they have no}} influence on <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> beggars. The role of social capital is varied. Members of informal insurance groups are more likely <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> both charities and beggars, while members of formal community groups are more likely <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> charities only. Members of interest groups are actually less likely to donate to charities and prefer <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> beggars...|$|R

5|$|According to Tibetologist John Powers, Tibetan sources counter this {{narrative}} of titles {{granted by the}} Chinese to Tibetans with various titles which the Tibetans <b>gave</b> <b>to</b> the Chinese emperors and their officials. Tribute missions from Tibetan monasteries to the Chinese court brought back not only titles, but large, commercially valuable gifts which could subsequently be sold. The Ming emperors sent invitations to ruling lamas, but the lamas sent subordinates rather than coming themselves, and no Tibetan ruler ever explicitly accepted the role of being a vassal of the Ming.|$|E

5|$|In other Jain texts, Krishna is stated to be {{a cousin}} of the twenty-second Tirthankara, Neminatha.

Long, a {{professor}} of religion known for his publications on Jainism, this connection between Krishna and Neminatha has been a historic reason for Jains to accept, read, and cite the Bhagavad Gita as a spiritually important text, celebrate Krishna-related festivals, and intermingle with Hindus as spiritual cousins.|$|E
