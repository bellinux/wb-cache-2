25|$|In the UK the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) has {{included}} RT in the viewer data it publishes since 2012. According to their data approximately 2.5 million Britons watched RT {{during the third}} quarter of 2012, making it the third most-watched rolling news channel in Britain, behind BBC News and Sky News (not including Sky Sports News). However RT was soon overtaken by Al Jazeera English, and viewing figures had dropped to about 2.1 million by the end of 2013. For comparison it has marginally fewer viewers than S4C, the state-funded Welsh language broadcaster, or minor channels such as Zing, Viva and Rishtey. According to internal <b>documents</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> Kremlin review, RT's viewership amounts to less than 0.1 percent of Europe's television audience, except in Britain, where 2013 viewership was estimated at approximately 120,000 persons per day. According to the leaked documents, RT was ranked 175th out of 278 channels in Great Britain in May 2013, or in fifth place out of eight cable news channels. In August 2015, RT's average weekly viewing figure had fallen to around 450,000 (0.8 percent of the total UK audience), 100,000 fewer than in June 2012 and less than half that of Al Jazeera English. In March 2016 the monthly viewing was figure 0.04%.|$|E

40|$|Plagiarism is {{a serious}} problem in higher {{education}} and generally acknowledged to be on the increase (McCabe, 2005). Text analysis tools have the potential to be applied to work submitted by students and assist the educator in the detection of plagiarised text. It is difficult to develop and evaluate such systems without examples of such documents. There is therefore the need for resources that contain examples of plagiarised text submitted by students. However, gathering examples of such texts presents a unique set of challenges for corpus construction. This paper discusses current work towards the creation of a corpus of <b>documents</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> assessment in higher education that contain examples of simulated plagiarism. The corpus is designed to represent the types of plagiarism that are found within higher education as closely as possible.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to see which harmful {{substances}} and which occupational settings most often required toxicological assessment, to evaluate exposure data provided by employers and to see to what extent could this assessment rely on actual measurements of harmful substances in a working environment. We reviewed the documentation that was submitted for toxicological assessment in all patients referred from occupational health physicians between 1992 and 2001. From 1992 to 2001, the Poison Control Centre performed a total of 260 toxicological evaluations of occupational exposure to harmful chemicals. In 162 cases (62 %), measurements of harmful substance concentrations in the working environment would have been of primary significance for the best comparison of potential adverse effects and the level of exposure. The most frequent was exposure to organic solvents in the production line and the use of various paints and varnishes, adhesives and thinners in shoe, chemical and metal-processing industry. Follows exposure to respiratory irritants, mostly in plastic and metal processing. However, measurement data of harmful substances in the working environment were available only in 24 cases, that is, in 9 % of all <b>documents</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> toxicological assessment. Exposure to organic solvents is characteristic for a large number of work places in industry and small enterprises in Croatia, and it is necessary to carry out a more comprehensive study about the real levels of exposure and modes of effective control.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} research which aimed to discover whether there were differences in leadership practices and perceptions of good leadership practice between German and UK organisations. Design/methodology/approach – A survey based on analysis of self-assessment <b>documents</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> the European Quality Award or its equivalents in Germany and the UK was distributed to 300 organisations in Germany and the UK. A response rate of 20 per cent was achieved. The survey was also distributed to 20 assessors. Findings – There were more differences in perceptions of good practice between German organisations recognised for excellence and German organisations not using the Excellence Model than between German and UK organisations. In the UK, there were more differences between what was described as good practice and what was described as usual practice among organisations not using the Excellence Model than among organisations recognised for excellence. German assessors differed in their view of good practices from UK assessors and German organisations. Research limitations/implications – The number of respondents was small, the organisations which chose to respond may not be typical and responses may not be accurate. A larger survey would help establish the generalisability of the findings. Focus groups would be particularly helpful in understanding the difference in perspective of the assessors. Practical implications – An awareness of Anglo German differences is helpful for managers with cross-border teams. The difference in assessor perceptions suggests that the training offered by the EFQM has not resulted in a common understanding. Originality/value – The paper is valuable both to academics who are interested in cross cultural leadership and to practitioners wrestling with the issues posed by cross-cultural teams...|$|E
