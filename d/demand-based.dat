25|$|The {{first major}} design {{decision}} Wertich made {{related to the}} complexity of the game's economic system. Due to the innovations he planned to introduce to the mechanics, and because the supply and <b>demand-based</b> gameplay of Settlers III was going to be more intricate than in previous titles, he felt that forcing players to concentrate too much on logistics would serve as an unwelcome distraction, and so decided to remove the need for a road network. Instead, settlers would have the freedom to move anywhere within the player's settlement, with the AI handling pathfinding. Another early decision was that the different races in Settlers III wouldn't just look different, they would have different abilities, different economic models and certain buildings unique to each one. Wertich, in consultation with Hertzler, also decided to create the game in high color, a first for the series, which had used 8-bit color for previous titles.|$|E
25|$|In making The Settlers II, Blue Byte {{wanted to}} improve upon the first Settlers title {{to as much}} of an extent and in as many ways as they could. To this end, they sought fan {{feedback}} from the first game, and hired Thomas Häuser, who had worked on quality assurance for The Settlers, as the lead designer. In light of their design principal of improving upon the original, although the core supply and <b>demand-based</b> gameplay is broadly the same, many other aspects of the game have been altered. For example, the sound effects and graphics have been enhanced, with more on-screen movements and more animations for the settlers themselves, and with four aesthetically distinct races; the economic system is more complex; the battle system is more strategic, with the player able to use scouts and stationary offensive weaponry; and a story-driven single-player campaign has been included.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} and co-programmed by Volker Wertich, creator of the original Settlers game. Having consulted fan feedback from the first two games, Wertich wanted to expand {{the scope of the}} third installment as much as possible, whilst preserving the elements which made the series unique. In light of this design principal, although the core supply and <b>demand-based</b> gameplay is broadly the same as in previous titles, many of the game mechanics have been altered. For example, combat is more involved, with the player given direct control over their army; roads are no longer necessary to connect buildings, as all settlers can now walk freely around the player's territory; headquarters no longer automatically generate settlers as required, instead the player must build residences to gain new settlers; and the different races are no longer merely aesthetically differentiated, they now have different economic models, different magic spells, different war machines, and several unique abilities and buildings. The game was also the first in the series to feature online multiplayer, the addition of which {{had been one of the}} main requests from fans.|$|E
25|$|Acting on {{feedback}} from some fans who had felt Settlers III was too focused on combat, the designers aimed {{for a return}} to the core supply and <b>demand-based</b> gameplay of the first two titles in the series. As a result, the game was designed {{to strike a balance between}} economic planning and military conquest, and, in light of this design principal, although the basic gameplay remains relatively unchanged from Settlers III, some of the game mechanics have been altered. For example, for the first time in the series, the offensive strength of the player's military is tied to the economic value of their settlement; the player has access to each rank of soldier from the beginning of each mission, with the ability to select the rank of every soldier prior to recruitment; the game's single-player campaign focuses on a race that cannot be defeated solely by military means; and specialty units and squad leaders have been added to enhance the tactical aspects of combat, with warships also made available, allowing for combat at sea.|$|E

2500|$|This paradox can be {{explained}} by analyzing the place, and impact, of increased savings in an economy.

Eventually the population's total saving will have remained the same or even declined because of lower incomes and a weaker economy.

2500|$|GameSpot's Ron Dulin scored it 6.4 out of 10, finding similar {{problems}} to Adams and Dy, and comparing it unfavourably to Impressions Games' City Building series. Finding it too similar to Settlers III, he felt Blue Byte {{had failed to}} move away from a reliance on combat. He also criticised the mission variety and the lack of combat strategy, writing, [...] "it's never more complex than moving all of your units slowly through enemy territory, hoping you'll have some left after your opponent doesn't."

2500|$|Blue Byte {{had always}} {{intended}} to make a sequel to The Settlers if it proved successful. When it was a commercial success, selling over 215,000 units, considerably more than expected, they immediately began development on a second game, {{with a total of}} twelve people working on the project. As well as enhancing the graphics and sound effects, and increasing the complexity of the supply and <b>demand-based</b> gameplay, there were also certain aspects of the original with which Blue Byte had been unhappy, and which they hoped to address in the sequel. They also sought feedback from fans of the first game, and worked to deal with anything the fanbase disliked or felt could be improved upon. However, Volker Wertich, who had designed and programmed the original, was not involved with the second game, because, as he describes it, [...] "after two years programming The Settlers, I didn't really want to see those little men for a while." ...|$|E
