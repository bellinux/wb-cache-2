60|$|Amerigo, {{with the}} chink of this gold in his ear, turned {{straight}} away, {{so as not}} to be instantly appealed to; and for the very emotion of the wonder, furthermore, of what divination may achieve when winged by a community of passion. Charlotte had uttered the exact plea that he had been keeping ready for the same foreseen necessity, and had uttered it simply as a consequence of their deepening unexpressed need of each other and without the passing between them of a word. He hadn't, God knew, to take it from her--he was too conscious of what he wanted; but the lesson for him was in the straight clear tone that Charlotte could thus distil, in the perfect felicity of her adding no explanation, no touch for plausibility, that she wasn't strictly obliged to add, and in the truly superior way in which women, so situated, express and distinguish themselves. She had answered Mrs. Assingham quite adequately; she had not spoiled it by a reason a scrap larger than the smallest that would serve, and she had, above all, thrown off, for his stretched but covered attention, an image that flashed like a mirror played at the face of the sun. The measure of EVERYTHING, to all his sense, at these moments, was in it--the measure especially of the thought that had been growing with him a positive obsession and that began to throb as never yet under this brush of her having, by perfect parity of imagination, the match for it. His whole consciousness had by this time begun almost to ache with a truth of an exquisite order, at the glow of which she too had, so unmistakably then, been warming herself--the truth that the occasion constituted by the last few days couldn't possibly, save by some poverty of their own, refuse them some still other and still greater beauty. It had already told them, with an hourly voice, that it had a meaning--a meaning that their associated sense was to drain even as thirsty lips, after the plough through the sands and the sight, afar, of the palm-cluster, might drink in at last the promised well in the desert. There had been beauty, day after day, and there had been, for the spiritual lips, something of the pervasive taste of it; yet it was all, none the less, as if their response had remained below their fortune. How to bring it, by some brave, <b>free</b> <b>lift,</b> up to the same height was the idea with which, behind and beneath everything, he was restlessly occupied, and in the exploration of which, as in that of the sun-chequered greenwood of romance, his spirit thus, at the opening of a vista, met hers. They were already, from that moment, so hand-in-hand in the place that he found himself making use, five minutes later, of exactly the same tone as Charlotte's for telling Mrs. Assingham that he was likewise, in the matter of the return to London, sorry for what mightn't be.|$|E

40|$|Trajectory {{simulations}} {{for high}} altitude scientific balloons have typically {{focused on the}} thermal balance of the system. The calculated upward force, or <b>free</b> <b>lift,</b> on the balloon {{was based on the}} density of the lifting gas and the density of the surrounding air. Aerodynamic models for calculating the ascent rate of the balloon were simple drag equations using a constant drag coefficient. The drag coefficient was adjusted in the model to allow general agreement with the total time to float from actual flight data. This generally results in predicted ascent rates that vary considerably from actual data at different points in the flight. In addition to the limitations of prediction of ascent rates on large balloons, observed ascent rates of very lightly loaded balloons have shown that {{there is a limit to}} ascent rate that is independent of the amount of initial <b>free</b> <b>lift</b> put in the balloon during inflation. In this paper, the authors will review previous work done on the aerodynamic modeling of ascending balloons and will present the results of a numerical study of the shapes of ascending balloons with the inclusion of an aerodynamic pressure distribution down the length of the balloon.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Biomechanical models are one of the tools industry and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) use to aid in the reduction of injuries due to overexertion (NIOSH, 1981). These models have been determined to be reasonably effective in estimating the maximum acceptable weight for a lift (Aghazadeh and Ayoub, 1985). Biomechanical models consider many variables, including posture, gender, strength capabilities, coefficient of static friction, and anthropometry. In two-dimensional static models, symmetric loading is assumed in the upper and lower extremities. This study was designed to evaluate the degree to which loading is symmetric in the upper extremities in an apparently symmetric task. Subjects performed a series of bilateral strength tests: shoulder flexion strength, elbow flexion strength, and grip strength. Four different lifts were performed and analyzed separately: stoop lift, squat lift, upright lift, and <b>free</b> <b>lift.</b> T-tests were conducted to test the statistical significant difference in the exertions on the right side and left side in each posture and in the bilateral strength tests. The assumption of symmetric loading during the stoop lift and squat lift is statistically valid, at the 0. 05 level, for this sample of subjects. The assumption of symmetric loading during the upright lift and <b>free</b> <b>lift</b> is not statistically valid. A statistical difference in maximum shoulder flexion strength was found with the right shoulder 9 % stronger than the left. However, no statistical difference was found in the maximum elbow flexion strength or the maximum grip strength. Assumptions of symmetric loading in the upper extremities during symmetric tasks appears to be reasonable for the simpler two-dimensional models, however three-dimensional models should address asymmetric loading/strength issues...|$|E
40|$|Piezoceramic {{actuators}} {{based on}} thick film technology offer {{the opportunity of}} integrated solutions for smart microsystems. Especially in adaptive micro-optics, where the height of devices is limited, outgassing has to be inhibited and complex actuator structures are required, screen printed actuators are of great interest. The paper highlights our recent research on micro-positioning stages for integration into a plenoptic camera. The first concept is based on through-thickness polarized lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thick films printed on a 45 mm x 44 mm x 0. 17 mm LTCC (Low Temperature Cofired Ceramics) frame with 4 mm wide legs. Driving with an electrical field of 2 kV/mm resulted in an upright stroke of 115 µm. The second concept combines through-thickness and in-plane polarized thick films on four cantilever beams of an Al 2 O 3 based micro-positioning stage. Because of the combination of d 31 - and d 33 -mode of excitation, each cantilever beam will provide an s-shaped bending profile allowing for a planar and tilt <b>free</b> <b>lift</b> of 130 µm at 1. 66 kV/mm. Both actuator concepts were exploited to adjust position of a micro-lens array between main lens and image sensor in a plenoptic camera setup. With that, working range of the plenoptic camera could be extended...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since its}} {{inception}} four decades back, Balloon Facility of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Hyderabad has been functioning {{with the needs of}} its user scientists at its focus. During the early nineties, when the X-ray astronomy group at TIFR expressed the need for balloons capable of carrying the X-ray telescopes to altitudes up to 42 km, the balloon group initiated research and development work on indigenous balloon grade films in various thickness not only for the main experiment but also in parallel, took up the development of thin films in thickness range 5 to 6 microns for fabrication of sounding balloons required for probing the stratosphere up to 42 km as the regular 2000 grams rubber balloon ascents could not reach altitudes higher than 38 km. By the year 1999, total indigenisation of sounding balloon manufacture was accomplished. The work on balloon grade ultra-thin polyethylene film in thickness range 2. 8 to 3. 8 microns for fabrication of balloons capable of penetrating mesosphere {{to meet the needs of}} user scientists working in the area of atmospheric dynamics commenced in 2011. Pursuant to the successful trials with 61, 000 cu. m balloon made of 3. 8 microns Antrix film reaching stratopause (48 km) for the first time in the history of balloon facility in the year 2012, fine tuning of launch parameters like percentage <b>free</b> <b>lift</b> was carried out to take the same volume balloons to higher mesospheric altitudes. Three successful flights with a total suspended load of 10 kg using 61, 000 cu. m balloons were carried out in the month of January 2014 and all the three balloons crossed in to the mesosphere reaching altitudes of over 51 km. All the balloons flown so far are closed system with no escape ducts. Balloon fabrication, development of launch hardware, flight control instruments and launch technique for these mesospheric balloon flights are discussed in this paper.
