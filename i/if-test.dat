2500|$|The ziggurat {{algorithm}} is {{faster than the}} Boxâ€“Muller transform and still exact. In about 97% of all cases it uses only two random numbers, one random integer and one random uniform, one multiplication and an <b>if-test.</b> Only in 3% of the cases, where the combination of those two falls outside the [...] "core of the ziggurat" [...] (a kind of rejection sampling using logarithms), do exponentials and more uniform random numbers have to be employed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Trusted Network Connect (TNC) {{requires}} both {{user authentication}} and integri-ty validation of an endpoint before it {{connects to the}} internet or accesses some web service. However, as the user authentication and integrity validation are usually done via independent protocols, TNC is vulnerable to the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. This paper analyzes T-NC which uses keys with Subject Key Attestation Evidence (SKAE) extension to perform user authentication and the <b>IF-T</b> protocol binding to TLS to carry integrity measurement messages in the Universally Composable (UC) framework. Our analysis result shows that TNC using keys with SKAE extension can resist the MitM attack. In this paper, we introduce two primitive ide-al functionalities for TNC: an ideal dual-authentication certification functionality which binds messages and both the user and platform identities, and an ideal platform attestation function-ality which formalizes the integrity verification of a platform. We prove that the SKAE extension protocol and the basic TCG platform attestation protocol, {{both of which are}} defined by TCG specifications, UC-realizes the two primitive functionalities respectively. In the end, we intro-duce a general ideal TNC functionality and prove that the complete TNC protocol, combining the <b>IF-T</b> binding to TLS which uses keys with SKAE extension for client authentication and the basic TCG platform attestation platform protocol, securely realizes the TNC functionality in the hybrid model...|$|R
40|$|Expression of {{embryonic}} genes is altered in different culture conditions, which influence developmental potential both during preimplantation and fetal development. The {{objective of this}} study was to define the effects of culture conditions on: bovine embryonic development to blastocyst stage, blastocyst cell number, apoptosis and expression patterns of a panel of developmen-tally important genes. Bovine embryos were cultured in vitro in three culture media containing amino acids, namely potassium simplex optimization medium (KSOMaa), Charles Rosenkrans 1 (CR 1 aa) and synthetic oviductal fluid (SOFaa). Apoptosis in blastocysts was determined by TUNEL assay and expression profiles of developmentally important genes were assayed by real-time PCR. In vivo-produced bovine blastocysts were used as controls for experiments determining gene expression patterns. While the cleavage rates did not differ, embryos cultured in SOFaa had higher rates of development to blastocyst stage (P < 0. 05). Mean cell numbers and percentages of apoptotic cells per blastocyst did not differ among the groups. Expression of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) gene was significantly up-regulated in both CR 1 aa and KSOMaa when compared with SOFaa (P < 0. 001). DNA methyltransferase 3 a (Dnmt 3 a) expression was higher in embryos cultured in CR 1 aa than in those cultured in SOFaa (P < 0. 001). Expression of interferon tau (<b>IF-t)</b> and insulin-like growth factor II receptor (Igf- 2 r) genes was significantly up-regulated in KSOMaa when compared with CR 1 aa (P < 0. 001). Gene expression did not differ between in vivo-derived blas-tocysts and their in vitro-derived counterparts. In conclusion, SOFaa supports higher development to blastocyst stage tha...|$|R
