25|$|The 1998 {{home run}} race had {{generated}} nearly unbroken positive publicity, but Barry Bonds' {{run for the}} all-time home run record provoked a backlash over steroids, which increase a person's testosterone level and subsequently enable that person to bodybuild with much more ease.

25|$|The {{procession}} of Holy Wednesday and Good Friday features close to forty pasos de misterios or carrozas and draws a huge crowd as spectators and participants as heirlooms images and newly commissioned ones are brought out. What sets it {{apart from other}} Semana Santa processions in the province <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> number of carrozas, but the solemnity and decorum on how it is done. The Hermandad de la Sagrada Pasion {{is the first in}} the province to have initiated the narration of the passion in dramatized form as the pasos are brought out to the streets. This is a rite that was eventually copied {{by the rest of the}} towns in Bulacan.|$|E

For a multitude unused to discipline is a hindrance to itself, when successful, in completing the victory, when routed, in taking to flight.

[...] Similar sexual sociologies are reported for other Muslim societies from North Africa to Pakistan and the Far East. In Afghanistan in 2009, the British Army was forced to commission a report into the sexuality of the local men after British soldiers reported the discomfort at witnessing adult males involved in sexual relations with boys. The report stated that though illegal, there was a tradition of such relationships in the country, known as bache bazi or [...] "boy play", and that it was especially strong around North Afghanistan.|$|E
2500|$|His books use {{comparative}} mythology {{and ancient}} literary sources (including the Old Testament) {{to argue that}} Earth suffered catastrophic close contacts with other planets (principally Venus and Mars) in ancient times.

[...] Velikovsky argued that electromagnetic effects {{play an important role in}} celestial mechanics. He also proposed a revised chronology for ancient Egypt, Greece, Israel and other cultures of the ancient Near East. [...] The revised chronology aimed at explaining the so-called [...] "dark age" [...] of the eastern Mediterranean (c. 1100–750 BC) and reconciling biblical history with mainstream archaeology and Egyptian chronology.|$|E
2500|$|In the Olympics {{or other}} highly {{competitive}} meets, many divers will have {{nearly the same}} list of dives as their competitors. [...] The importance for divers competing at this level <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> DD, but how they arrange their list. Once the more difficult rounds of dives begin {{it is important to}} lead off with a confident dive to build momentum. They also tend to put a very confident dive in front of a very difficult dive to ensure that they will have a good mentality for the difficult dive. Most divers have pre-dive and post-dive rituals that help them either maintain or regain focus. Coaches also play a role in this aspect of the sport. Many divers rely on their coaches to help keep their composure during the meet. In a large meet coaches are rarely allowed on the deck to talk to their athlete so it is common to see coaches using hand gestures or body movements to communicate.|$|E

The Project for Public Spaces rated the plaza the eighth-worst public plaza in the world in 2004. Others have praised the plaza's new design. The Washington Post said the canopies provide [...] "a pleasant shock... Seven ghostly spaceships appear to be hovering comfortably above its front yard, keeping watch over an orderly gathering of white-rimmed, ground-hugging disks shouldering healthy mounds of grass." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bennett {{discusses}} {{this is his}} 1998, 2001 and 2008 {{books and}} in his 2008 chapter on the Cross. He suggests that while almost all Muslims believe that Jesus did not die on the Cross (although some argue that Q5: 157 is an ambiguous verse) and while Christians believe that Jesus was crucified and died on the cross, {{there might be a}} way to argue that [...] "Jesus was and yet was not killed on the cross." [...] Referring again to paradox, he argues that what the Qur'an denies <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> fact that Jesus died but that he was killed by the Jews. [...] Indeed, says Bennett, Jesus was not killed by the Jews but by human sin. [...] Christian conviction that Jesus' death was absolutely necessary for human salvation makes nonsense of blaming any particular human agencies for his execution. Bennett does not deny Jesus' death but says that [...] "the Qur'an's apparent although not unambiguous denial of the Cross challenges Christian over-emphasis on Jesus' death." [...] Bennett sees the cross as a [...] "metaphor of resisting evil and oppression" [...] but is not [...] "convinced that his salvation … derives from the cross". [...] Rather, he says, [...] "my sanctification {{stems from the fact that}} Jesus lived" [...] and by living [...] "sanctified the whole of human life." [...] He regards Jesus' life as a paradigm of [...] "being in relationship with God". [...] Jesus life represents [...] "the paradigm of the life of love and action lived in tune with God's will". Explicit faith in Jesus is not a precondition of salvation, since [...] "God saves whomsoever he wills". A life that reflects Jesus' life of service of others is a precondition. [...] As a Christian, he can honour Muhammad as someone through whom God spoke and whose legacy [...] "can be interpreted as complementary" [...] to Christ's.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} Soap Stars, Debbie Foy refers to Tony as having lived through several {{dramatic}} episodes. Foy {{went on to}} describe Tony as being famous for his [...] "many on-screen relationships, affairs and engagements" [...] but always has plenty of heartache. The Daily Star described Tony as going [...] "through more women than he’s served hot meals in his restaurant Gnosh" [...] before adding {{that he is a}} [...] "loser-in-love". They commented that after dumping Cindy [...] "this time he’s only got himself to blame". On the character Sky said: [...] "Tony Hutchinson is our fave character on the show. Probably because he's been on it the whole time since it started in 1995". An Inside Soap critic responded negatively to a plot centring on Tony catering for the college ball saying [...] "Just who do the Hollyoaks writers think they are catering for with a plot like this? Do us a favour and serve up something decent!" [...] The Liverpool Echos Caroline Corcoran reviewed Hollyoaks: Movin' On saying the spinoff provided [...] "an insight in to Tony's character that we don't get in Hollyoaks, and I actually found myself feeling for a character that is normally written to be deliberately irritating". Another critic for Inside Soap felt Hollyoaks was back to a high standard before adding that [...] "Tony Hutchinson has been on fine comedy form following the disastrous transformation of his garden by 'Charlie Dimmock'". Inside Soaps Lucy said that [...] "You've got to feel sorry for Hollyoaks's Tony Hutchinson ... Give the man a break!" [...] Following Tony's relationship with Mandy becoming troubled. Lucy's colleague Sam also reviewed the storyline saying: [...] "Feel sorry for Tony? Oh get over it! He deserves everything he's got coming to him. What is Mandy doing with him anyway? He's far too old, a total fuddy duddy, and has had the same naff hairstyle for seven years!" [...] While reflecting on [...] "some of soap's more memorable business ideas", an Inside Soap writer, on Tony's business ideas, said: [...] "Tony Hutchinson, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> king of money-making schemes - more of an old skin-flint ... he {{came up with the idea}} of recycling all his guest's used water ... When his recycling racket was discovered, his claims that it was just an innovative method of being environmentally friendly wouldn't wash - we all knew it was just his cheap-skate way of reducing his water bill! However, to this day his roses continue to bloom strangely well". Inside Soap critic Sam expressed disinterest in a storyline in which Tony and Ruth kiss, questioning if they have [...] "gone back in time or something?" [...] Merle Brown of the Daily Record bemoaned the lack of realism in Tony's storylines saying: [...] "why on earth would Izzy go out with Tony? Yes, she's slightly irritating, but in the real world would a man like Tony honestly have a constant stream of girlfriends?" [...] Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail felt that [...] "Asking Tony for guidance is the equivalent of asking the obese for dieting tips, such a fat lot of good he is". Stephens later said Tony has [...] "enjoyed the company of as many women as Hugh Hefner". During the Enjoy The Ride storyline, Inside Soaps Sarah said [...] "there are standout performances from some of my all-time favourite Hollyoaks stars" [...] which she said included Pickard.|$|E
