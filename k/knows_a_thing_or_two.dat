[...] Mof Gimmers of TV Scoop praised the episode, saying [...] "Neil Cross <b>knows</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> about ratcheting up the tension, and in the finale of the seventh series of Spooks he used both of them.

[...] Gimmers called the chase sequence in the episode [...] "one of the most thrilling traditional chase sequences ever seen on British TV," [...] the interplay between the characters [...] "was handled expertly," [...] and ended with [...] "already I can't wait for the next series!" ...|$|E

He had put up his horse with due care, and supped with due deliberation; and then, in a very agreeable frame of mind, went out to pay a visit in the grey of the evening. It was not a very wise proceeding on the young man's part. He would have done better to remain beside the fire or go decently to bed. For the town was full of the troops of Burgundy and England under a mixed command; and though Denis was there on safe-conduct, his safe-conduct was like to serve him little on a chance encounter.|$|E
