5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>global</b> public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits traded within the cap. The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on the setting of the cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|E
