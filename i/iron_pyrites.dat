5|$|During the Song period, {{there was}} a great deal of {{organized}} labor and bureaucracy involved in the extraction of resources from the various provinces in China. The production of sulfur, which the Chinese called 'vitriol liquid', was extracted from pyrite and used for pharmaceutical purposes as well as for the creation of gunpowder. This was done by roasting <b>iron</b> <b>pyrites,</b> converting the sulphide to oxide, as the ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthenware furnace with a type of still-head to send the sulfur over as vapour, after which it would solidify and crystallize. The historical text of the Song Shi (History of the Song, compiled in 1345 AD) stated that the major producer of sulfur in the Tang and Song dynasties was the Jin Zhou sub-provincial administrative region (modern Linfen in southern Shanxi). The bureaucrats appointed to the region managed the industrial processing and sale of it, and the amount created and distributed from the years 996 to 997 alone was 405,000 jin (roughly 200 tons). It was recorded that in 1076 AD the Song government held a strict commercial monopoly on sulfur production, and if dye houses and government workshops sold their products to private dealers in the black market, they were subject to meted penalties by government authorities. Even before this point, in 1067 AD, the Song government had issued an edict that the people living in Shanxi and Hebei were forbidden to sell foreigners any products containing saltpetre and sulfur. This act by the Song government displayed their fears of the grave potential of gunpowder weapons being developed by Song China's territorial enemies as well (i.e. the Tanguts and Khitans).|$|E

40|$|Although <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> {{had been}} {{identified}} as a novel photo-voltaic material, it is yet to be harnessed. <b>Iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> forms mechanically unstable films with pinholes.

40|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> is a {{promising}} material for photovoltaic power production due to low material extraction and processing costs and high optical absorption. Reliable production of photovoltaic grade <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> thin films has, however, been challenging. One potential fabrication route is the direct conversion of iron-to-iron pyrite by sulfur annealing (sulfurization). Bulk iron thin films are used typically {{but they can}} suffer from cracking or delamination. Herein we report the sulfurization of porous, columnar Fe films deposited with Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD), which allows us to control the inter-column spacing (void-fraction) of the precursor film. We show that the morphology and microstructure of the <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> films are strongly affected by the void-fraction. By precisely tuning the void-fraction of the precursor film at 82 oblique angle incidence deposition we can produce <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> films with increased crystallite sizes > 100 nm with a uniform, crack-free, facetted granular microstructure. Large crystallites may reduce carrier recombination at grain boundaries, which is attractive for photovoltaic devices.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} study on <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> using density-functional theory (DFT) and the GW approximation to many-body perturbation theory. The fundamental band gap of <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> {{is determined by}} iron 3 d states at the valence band edge and a sulfur 3 p-dominated conduction band at Γ. The gap is quite sensitive to structural changes {{as well as to}} the applied electronic structure method. We found that this p-dominated band does not play a significant role for the optical absorption, leading to a large difference between the optical and fundamental band gaps of <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite.</b> As a consequence the GW-corrected energies result in no considerable change of the optical band gap as compared to standard DFT, both being in reasonable agreement with experiment. However, we show that the fundamental band gap is reduced to about 0. 3 eV in GW, which may contribute to the low open-circuit voltage of about 0. 2 V observed in <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> solar cells, representing a serious bottleneck for photovoltaic applications.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} first-principles {{calculations}} for pyrite and marcasite compounds,with a particular {{focus on their}} suitability for photovoltaic applications. Their electronicstructure and their optical properties are thoroughly investigated within density-functionaltheory (DFT) using various exchange-correlation functionals, among them sophisticatedhybrid functionals. To account for electronic excitations the many-body perturbationtheory in the GW approximation has also been exploited. The investigation of the electronic and optical properties of <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> (FeS 2) coversan essential part of this thesis, since <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> {{is reported to be}} a promising material forphotovoltaic applications due to its large optical absorption, a suitable band gap and largephotocurrents. Furthermore, <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> consists of abundant elements, and thus wouldallow for a large-scale and long-term utilization. However, <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> solar cells exhibitonly an open-circuit voltage of merely 200 mV, leading to a small conversion efficiency of 3 %, which disqualifies <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> for photovoltaic applications at present. This thesis exposes that the question {{about the size of the}} fundamental and opticalband gap of <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite,</b> both, theoretically and experimentally, might not be settled yet. Low-intensity contributions in the optical absorption might complicate the determinationof the optical band gap, and the GW results show that the fundamental band gap mightbe much smaller than expected. Therefore, the small fundamental band gap of pristineiron pyrite in the bulk phase might be already responsible for the low open-circuit voltage. Since interfaces and surfaces play an important role for the photovoltaic performance,the electronic structure of the most stable <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> surfaces is also discussed, revealingthat surface states of Fe 3 d character might act as charge recombination centers. Firstattempts to passivate these surface states indicate that heavier adatoms are more suitablethan light adatoms. The application of the GW approximation on <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> yields an unconventional reductionof the band gap compared to the “plain” DFT results, whereas largely overestimatedband gaps are obtained using hybrid functionals. By extending the calculations to otherpyrite compounds (RuS 2, OsS 2, NiP 2 and ZnS 2) and to the structurally closely relatedmarcasite compounds (FeS 2, FeSe 2 and FeTe 2), it is shown that the interplay of transitionsbetween p and d states and the screening caused by the d states is responsible for thispeculiar behavior. Finally, a particular focus is set on FeS 2 marcasite, which is reported to coexist withthe pyrite phase, but is presumed to degrade the photovoltaic performance. However, theresults in this thesis indicate that iron marcasite might be better suited for photovoltaicapplications than <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite...</b>|$|R

The cliff was not 100 yards long, and was about 70 thick; its surface was shivered by frost into cubical masses, and glacial boulders of gneiss lay on the top. The limestone rock was chiefly a blue pisolite conglomerate, with veins and crystals of white carbonate of lime, seams of shale, and <b>iron</b> <b>pyrites.</b> A part was compact and blue, very crystalline, and full of encrinitic fossils, and probably nummulites, but all were too much altered for determination.|$|E

60|$|Dikes are {{frequent}} in the metamorphic schists of the Chonos Islands, and seem feebly to represent that great band of trappean and ancient volcanic rocks on the south-western coast of Tierra del Fuego. At S. Andres I {{observed in the}} space of half-a-mile, seven broad, parallel dikes, composed of three varieties of trap, running in a N.W. and S.E. line, parallel to the neighbouring mountain-ranges of altered clay-slate; but they must be of long subsequent origin to these mountains; for they intersected the volcanic formation described in the last chapter. North of Tres Montes, I noticed three dikes differing from each other in composition, one of them having a euritic base including large octagons of quartz; these dikes, as well as several of porphyritic greenstone at Vallenar Bay, extended N.E. and S.W., nearly at right angles to the foliation of the schists, but in the line of their joints. At Low's Harbour, however, a set of great parallel dikes, one ninety yards and another sixty yards in width, have been guided by the foliation of the mica-schist, and hence are inclined westward at an angle of 45 degrees: these dikes are formed of various porphyritic traps, some of which are remarkable from containing numerous rounded grains of quartz. A porphyritic trap of this latter kind, passed in one of the dikes into a most curious hornstone, perfectly white, with a waxy fracture and pellucid edges, fusible, and containing many grains of quartz and specks of <b>iron</b> <b>pyrites.</b> In the ninety-yard dike several large, apparently now quite isolated, fragments of mica-slate were embedded: but as their foliation was exactly parallel to that of the surrounding solid rock, no doubt these new separate fragments originally formed wedge-shaped depending portions of a continuous vault or crust, once extending over the dike, but since worn down and denuded.|$|E
60|$|Another {{and very}} {{different}} form of thunderbolt is the belemnite, a common English fossil often preserved in {{houses in the}} west country with the same superstitious reverence as the neolithic hatchets.

At the present day, when all our girls go to Girton and enter for the classical tripos, I need hardly translate the word belemnite 'for the benefit of the ladies,' as people used to do in the dark and unemancipated eighteenth century; but as our boys have left off learning Greek just as their sisters are beginning to act the 'Antigone' at private theatricals, I may perhaps be pardoned if I explain, 'for the benefit of the gentlemen,' that the word is practically equivalent to javelin-fossil. The belemnites are the internal shells of a sort of cuttle-fish which swam about in enormous numbers in the seas whose sediment forms our modern lias, oolite, and gault. A great many different species are known and have acquired charming names in very doubtful Attic at the hands of profoundly learned geological investigators, but almost all are equally good representatives of the mythical thunderbolt. The finest specimens are long, thick, cylindrical, and gradually tapering, with a hole at one end as if on purpose to receive the shaft. Sometimes they have petrified into <b>iron</b> <b>pyrites</b> or copper compounds, shining like gold, and then they make very noble thunderbolts indeed, heavy as lead, and capable of doing profound mischief if properly directed. At other times they have crystallised in transparent spar, and then they form very beautiful objects, as smooth and polished as the best lapidary could possibly make them. Belemnites are generally found in immense numbers together, especially in the marlstone quarries of the Midlands, and in the lias cliffs of Dorsetshire. Yet the quarrymen who find them never seem to have their faith shaken in the least by the enormous quantities of thunderbolts that would appear to have struck a single spot with such extraordinary frequency This little fact also tells rather hardly against the theory that the lightning never falls twice upon the same place.|$|E
