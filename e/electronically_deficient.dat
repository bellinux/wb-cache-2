40|$|Synthesis of <b>Electronically</b> <b>Deficient</b> Atropisomeric Bisphosphine Ligands and Their Application in Asymmetric Hydrogenation of QuinolinesA {{series of}} <b>electronically</b> <b>deficient</b> atropisomeric bisphosphine ligands have been {{synthesized}} from (S) -MeO-BiPhep. The introduction of electron-withdrawing {{groups in the}} ligands had a dramatic influence on both the enantioselectivity and the activity of catalyst. The iridium complex of the MeO-BiPhep-based ligand bearing a trifluoromethanesulfonyl group was successfully applied in the asymmetric hydrogenation of quinolines with ee values of up to 95 % and turnover numbers (TON) of up to 14, 600...|$|E
40|$|A new <b>electronically</b> <b>deficient</b> atropisomeric {{diphosphine}} ligand (S) -CF 3 O-BiPhep was synthesized from 1 -bromo- 3 -(trifluoromethoxy) benzene in high yield. The key steps included oxidative coupling with anhydrous {{ferric chloride}} and optical resolution by (+) -DMTA. The ligand afforded high performance for Ir-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of quinolines with ee up to 92 % and TON up to 25, 000. It was also successfully {{applied to the}} Pd-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of simple indoles with ee up to 87 % and Rh-catalyzed asymmetric 1, 4 -addition of phenylboronic acid to 2 -cyclohexenone with 97 % ee.

Org. Lett. 2012, 14, 6092). Aminal radical intermediates can participate in inter- and intra-molecular reactions using both Bu 3 SnH and (TMS) ₃SiH as hydride donors. Carbon–carbon bonds were formed selectively at the aminal carbon {{in the presence of}} α-amino alkyl groups within the molecule. Bicyclic aminals also participated in C-C bond formation affording products in high diastereoselectivity. The application of aminal radical intermediates toward the synthesis of the nitrogen- rich alkaloid goniomitine was investigated. The first generation route involved the development of an acyclic aminal bearing the nitrogen of a 2, 3 -disubstituted indole and the N-(2 -iodobenzyl) formamide nitrogen atom. In the reaction of N- (hydroxymethyl) -N-(2 -iodobenzyl) formamide and the indole substrate, none of the desired acyclic aminal was observed. A second generation route utilized an α-aminoalkyl radical intermediate (generated by radical translocation) to construct the indole framework of goniomitine. The synthesis commenced with a copper-catalyzed Ullmann reaction of an aryl iodide and ethyl-substituted lactam providing the corresponding N-aryl coupling product in 96...|$|E
