5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, while much has improved, many would argue that there is still much to be done. <b>From</b> <b>art</b> films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have a stronger voice, but are only too aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} two hundred and five awards were {{presented}} in the 1970s twenty-eight in 1970, followed by forty-one in 1971, fifty in 1972, seventeen in 1973, twenty-one in 1974, fifteen in 1975, sixteen in 1976 and seventeen in 1977, including eight foreign recipients. Individuals from nine different fields were awarded, which includes thirty-four <b>from</b> <b>art,</b> forty-three from civil services, forty-eight from literature and education, seventeen from medicine, three from public affairs, twenty-six from science and engineering, twenty-one from social work, one sports person, and twelve from trade and industry. Novelist Khushwant Singh, who accepted the award in 1974 {{in the field of}} literature and education, returned it in 1984 as a notion of protest against the Operation Blue Star.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{painting}} met with mixed reactions <b>from</b> <b>art</b> critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the release}} of their second album Colourmeinkindness (2012), Basement {{announced}} a hiatus due to personal commitments. In 2014, guitarist Alex Henery revealed it was because vocalist Andrew Fisher wishing to become a certified teacher which required {{him to return to}} school for a period of a year and a half. Drummer James Fisher, Fisher's younger brother, was graduating <b>from</b> <b>art</b> school, {{and the rest of the}} members were working on their respective careers. Henery, meanwhile, was working as a videographer in Boston, Massachusetts for the record label Run for Cover Records.|$|E
5|$|Following their Star Search audition, Johnny and the Moondogs {{changed their}} name to Japage 3 (combining letters {{from each of}} the member's names: John, Paul, and George). Lennon had a friend <b>from</b> <b>art</b> school, named Derek Hodkin, who owned a tape recorder, and Lennon {{convinced}} him to record the group (along with McCartney's brother Mike on drums). The group then asked Hodkin to act as their manager, and he agreed. Despite Hodkin's management, bookings for the group dried up. Harrison began a stint as rhythm guitarist in the Les Stewart Quartet, who had a weekly club engagement. By May, Japage 3 was defunct, although the three continued to see each other socially, and Lennon and McCartney continued to write songs together.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} <b>from</b> <b>art</b> historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography {{to develop an}} understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.|$|E

5|$|Rodin's sister Maria, {{two years}} his senior, died of {{peritonitis}} in a convent in 1862. Rodin was anguished and felt guilty {{because he had}} introduced Maria to an unfaithful suitor. Turning away <b>from</b> <b>art,</b> he briefly joined a Catholic order, the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder {{and head of the}} congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and, sensing his lack of suitability for the order, encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. He returned to work as a decorator, while taking classes with animal sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. The teacher's attention to detail– his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion– significantly influenced Rodin.|$|E

5|$|When the {{restoration}} of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections <b>from</b> <b>art</b> historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was James Beck, of ArtWatch International, who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} from National Service in 1962 Dibnah {{retrieved}} his tools from storage, bought a 1927 350cc AJS motorcycle for 21guineas and looked for more work. Bolton, however, {{was in the midst}} of post-industrial decline; between 1957 and 1965 about 70mills were closed in the town, leaving only 37mills operational and about 50disused. Initially he was unable to find much work and existed on smaller, domestic jobs, until he earned enough to buy his own set of ladders and secured his first commission while working at a local mill. He was paid £140 to point a mill tower, which he did at weekends. He struggled, however, to get any more meaningful work, until he met Lonsdale Bonner, one of his teachers <b>from</b> <b>art</b> college. The two agreed a deal whereby Bonner would be paid a commission for each job he got for Dibnah. His first job was dismantling a chimney alongside the Manchester and Bolton Railway, a difficult proposition, as a mistake could force the temporary closure of the railway. The two managed to gain commissions for several jobs, but their relationship was terminated when Dibnah was called upon to undertake another six months of National Service.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{historical}} residential core lies in an {{area known}} as Midtown, containing upscale neighborhoods built in the early 20th century with architecture ranging <b>from</b> <b>art</b> deco to Greek Revival. The University of Tulsa, the Swan Lake neighborhood, Philbrook Museum, and the upscale shopping districts of Utica Square, Cherry Street, and Brookside are located in this region. A {{large portion of the}} city's southern half has developed since the 1970s, containing low density housing and retail developments. This region, marked by secluded homes and suburban neighborhoods, contains one of the state's largest shopping malls, Woodland Hills Mall, as well as Southern Hills Country Club, and Oral Roberts University. East of Highway 169 and north of 61st street, a diverse racial makeup marks the eastern portions of the city, with large Asian and Mexican communities and much of the city's manufacturing industry.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Lichtenstein {{moved on}} from his much-celebrated {{imagery of the}} early 1960s, and began his Modern Paintings series, {{including}} over 60 paintings and accompanying drawings. Using his characteristic Ben-Day dots and geometric shapes and lines, he rendered incongruous, challenging images out of familiar architectural structures, patterns borrowed <b>from</b> <b>Art</b> Déco and other subtly evocative, often sequential, motifs. The Modern Sculpture series of 1967–8 made reference to motifs <b>from</b> <b>Art</b> Déco architecture.|$|E
