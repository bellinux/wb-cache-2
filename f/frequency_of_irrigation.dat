Water management strategies varied with soil moisture tensions. Irrigation by drip systems was carried out when soil water tensions reached 15 - 30 kPa (high moisture), whereas for SU the trigger soil tension was 30 - 60 kPa (moderate moisture). All other systems were conducted at both soil water tension ranges. One additional treatment was conducted with overhead sprinkler, high soil moisture and straw mulch (ASpalha).

40|$|Background: Osteitic bone is {{a feature}} of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), {{potentially}} {{playing a role in}} pathogenesis. Although seen after previous endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), it is also a de novo feature in patients without prior interventions. In these patients, osteitis is associated with high tissue and serum eosinophilia. However, the impact of osteitis on prognosis is unclear. This study investigates the clinical and endoscopic outcomes between patients with and without osteitis after primary ESS. Methods: A prospective study of a cohort of previously unoperated patients with CRS undergoing ESS was performed. The sinuses were scored radiologically for osteitis using the Global Osteitis Score (GOS) and Kennedy Osteitis Score (KOS) preoperatively and were also scored dichotomously for {{the presence or absence of}} osteitis. Disease-specific quality of life (22 -item Sino-Nasal Outcomes Test [SNOT- 22]), nasal symptom score (NSS), endoscopic score (Lund-Kennedy), and clinical outcomesincluding oral steroid use, <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> nasal steroid <b>irrigation,</b> and infective exacerbationswere collected at baseline and 1 year postsurgery. The presence and extent of osteitis was assessed relative to clinical outcome. Results: Fifty-three patients were included (41. 5 % female, age 47. 4 13. 8 years), 42. 9 % of which had radiologic osteitis. There was no significant association between the presence or severity of osteitis at the time of surgery and SNOT- 22, NSS, or endoscopy scores at 12 months postsurgery. However, the presence of osteitis was associated with the need for a course of oral steroid postsurgery (odds ratio [OR]= 4. 17; p = 0. 026). High tissue eosinophilia could not predict this alone (p = 0. 55). There was no significant relationship between osteitis and the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> steroid <b>irrigations</b> or infective exacerbations. Conclusion: Osteitis in CRS is associated with the degree of eosinophilia and as a independent process it was associated with the need for a course of systemic corticosteroid over a 12 -month period, but did it not affect overall disease control. 5 page(s...|$|R

The model was run under two assumptions: 1) the effective rain compensates water deficiency of soil down to daily root depth and the excess water is assumed as deep percolation (case I); 2) the effective rain compensates water deficiency of soil down to maximum root depth and the excess water is assumed as deep percolation (case II). The {{results show that the}} amount and the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> in case 2 is less than case 1. Average amount and number of irrigation events decreased from 706. 8 (mm) and 8 in case I to 569. 2 and 6. 4 in case II. The average relative percentage of effective rain increased from 45. 2 % in case I to 76. 9 % in case II. The effective rain is 108. 9 mm and the amount and number of irrigation events is 9 and 757. 7 mm, respectively in case I (at probability level of 80 %). The effective rain is 236. 7 mm and the amount and number of irrigation events is 636. 9 mm and 7. 2, respectively in case II (at probability level of 50 %). The effective rain is 165. 6 mm and the amount and number of irrigation events is 712. 6 mm 8, respectively in case I. The effective rain is 292. 1 mm and the amount and number of irrigation events is 545. 1 and 6, respectively in case II...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{combination}} of hydrogel and fertilizer as slow release fertilizer hydrogel (SRFH) {{has become one}} of the promising materials to overcome the shortcomings of conventional fertilizer by decreasing fertilizer loss rate, supplying nutrients sustainably, and lowering <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation.</b> A comparative study on water retention and plant growth performances of SRFH made from three hydrophilic monomers; acrylic acid (AA), acrylamide (AAm) and AA-co-AAm was executed. PAA SRFH has smaller swelling rate constant, k as it required only 166. 67 minutes to absorb 0. 63 of its equilibrium capacity of swelling, followed by P(AA-co-AAm) SRFH and PAAm SRFH. Although PAAm SRFH has the lowest swelling rate constant, it has the most excellent water retention ability in soil followed by P(AA-co-AAm) SRFH. Additionally, the presence of PAA SRFH in soil has enhanced the plant growth performances of model plant (capsicum annum) in term of its average leaf width and plant height. The synergistic effects of acrylic acid and acrylamide in P(AA-co-AAm) SRFH could be utilized to produce hydrogel used in agriculture...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate the effects <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> and soil management on potato tuber diseases. Supplemental irrigation, soil amendment and crop rotation can improve potato growth and tuber yield under drought stress conditions, but may also increase potato tuber diseases. The effects <b>of</b> <b>irrigation,</b> soil amendment and crop rotation on the incidence of tuber diseases were quantified from 1994 to 1997 in potato plots. Surface sprinkler irrigation was applied each year, based on tensiometer or moisture block readings deployed in field plots. Black scurf (Rhizoctonia solani), black dot (Colletotricchum coccodes), silver scurf (Helminthosporium solani) and common scab (Streptomyces scabei) diseases were quantified on potato tubers randomly sampled at harvest and kept at storage temperature of 7. 2 °C before visual disease assessment. The incidence of tuber diseases varied among irrigation treatments, crop rotations and soil amendments. The mean incidence of black scurf, silver scurf and black dot ranged from 3 - 18, 2 - 33 and 4 - 7 %, in best, un-irrigated and reduced irrigation, respectively. The incidence of back scurf, silver scurf and black dot diseases ranged from 2. 4 - 10, 0. 8 - 21 and 1 - 31 % on potato tubers grown in plots under green manure rotation crop (peas/vetch). Disease incidences on tubers were 1 - 28, 0 - 35 and 2 - 16 % for black scurf, silver scurf and black dot, respectively; when potato plants were grown under small-grain rotation. Soil amendments had significant (p< 0. 05) effects on the incidences of silver scurf disease in 1997 and black dot disease in 1996 and 1997. The interactions of soil amendment with irrigation resulted in significant effects on black scurf incidence in 1994. This research implied that water application may lead to increases in some potato tuber diseases, however; crop rotation and soil amendment may reduce the incidences of selective potato tuber diseases, depending on the type, duration or <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> supplemental <b>irrigation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Observations of {{bacterial}} soft rot of onions in the Lake Labish area in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon showed that two distinct symptom types occur during the growing season. The most prevalent symptom type appears in infected plants as a wilting and chlorosis {{of two or more}} lower leaves which is followed closely by appearance of elongated lesions emerging from the neck and extending up the adaxial side of one or more young leaves. Although most infected plants showing these symptoms usually decay quickly, some plants may appear to partially recover if conditions unfavorable for disease development return. A second symptom type is evident in those infected plants in which the collapse of all emerged leaves occurs simultaneously. During leaf collapse, foliar color changes from dark green to grey-green and finally, with desiccation, to light tan. Two kinds of soft rot also occur commonly in stored onions. One kind of decay, commonly called "slippery skin, " is characterized by the progression of soft rot down through {{one or two of the}} outer fleshy scales. These scales turn yellowish, soft, and are foul smelling. A second kind of soft rot is characterized by the interior of the bulb being totally macerated and putrid, but only slightly discolored. Only one or two of the outer fleshy scales remain firm. This decay is commonly called "stinking rot" because of its very offensive odor. Initial appearance {{of bacterial}} soft rot in the third week of June is directly related to occurrence of rain and cool, cloudy weather in the previous week. Occurrence of such periods of inclement weather are found to be predictable when past records of local climatological conditions are analyzed. Area-wide outbreaks throughout the remainder of the growing season also are related to such periods of inclement weather. The relationship between weather and disease suggests that outbreaks of {{bacterial soft rot}} can be forecast by occurrence of such periods <b>of</b> inclement weather. <b>Irrigation</b> <b>of</b> onions with contaminated surface waters significantly increases the amount of bacterial soft rot in the field, at harvest time, and in storage, over that found when uncontaminated well water is used. Varying the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigations,</b> the rates <b>of</b> application, and the size of sprinkler nozzles affect the amount of soft rot in the field and in storage somewhat less than does the source of water. Longer and more frequent periods <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> increase the incidence of bacterial soft rot. Much of the decay seen at harvest is either soft rot which has totally decayed the bulbs and will not go into storage, or is fungal in origin. Including storage rots which are fungal in origin under the general grouping of "soft rots" inflates the estimation of losses due to bacterial soft rot. Three isolates of seventeen unknown isolates capable of decaying inoculated onion bulbs were identified as Pseudomonas cepacia. Five isolates which lack ability to produce a water-soluble fluorescent pigment and possess a nitrate reductase system were otherwise virtually identical to P. cepacia. Two additional isolates were identified as P. cichorii on the basis of physiological tests. Three other isolates were provisionally identified as members of the genus Erwinia on the basis of cell shape, flagellation, and pathogenicity. The remaining four isolates were not identified...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the water flow computer model, WATABLE, using experimental field observations on water table management plots from a site located near Hastings, FL, USA. The experimental field had scale drainage systems with provisions for subirrigation with buried microirrigation and conventional seepage irrigation systems. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) growing seasons from years 1996 and 1997 were used to simulate the hydrology of the area. Water table levels, precipitation, irrigation and runoff volumes were continuously monitored. The model simulated the water movement from a buried microirrigation line source and {{the response of the}} water table to irrigation, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and deep percolation. The model was calibrated and verified by comparing simulated results with experimental field observations. The model performed very well in simulating seasonal runoff, irrigation volumes, and water table levels during crop growth. The two-dimensional model can be used to investigate different irrigation strategies involving water table management control. Applications of the model include optimization of the water table depth for each growth stage, and duration, <b>frequency,</b> and rate <b>of</b> <b>irrigation.</b> 200...|$|R
