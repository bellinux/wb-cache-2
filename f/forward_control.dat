5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s and in {{the early}} 1960s, VAT and the French Camions Willème SA had plans for joint production, but only one jointly {{produced}} prototype was ever made; the chassis was from Vanaja, the engine was from AEC, and the cabin, which was a <b>forward</b> <b>control</b> type cabin and partly made from glass fibre, was from Willème.|$|E
5|$|The {{company had}} several {{suppliers}} of lorry cabins; they were produced {{at the beginning}} by Tampella, Valmet, Messukylän Autokoritehdas, Auto-Heinonen, Kiitokori and later as a main supplier by Lahden Autokori. VAT itself made cabins for some special, one-off products. In the late 1960s, some Vanajas were equipped with British Ergomatic <b>forward</b> <b>control</b> cabins made by Motor Panels. The cabins were bought via A.E.C.|$|E
50|$|In the Pacific Theater, 4 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force began <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> at the Battle of Buna-Gona, New Guinea in November 1942. The RAAF {{continued}} <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> in the Pacific for {{the rest}} of the war. By November 1943, the U.S. Marines were using <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> during the Battle of Bougainville.|$|R
50|$|No. 4 <b>Forward</b> Air <b>Control</b> Flight was a Royal Australian Air Force <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> {{training}} unit. The Flight {{was formed}} on 1 April 1970 at RAAF Base Williamtown and {{was equipped with}} four CAC Winjeel aircraft. The Flight was responsible for training RAAF, Royal Australian Navy and Australian Army pilots and participated in most Australian military exercises. No. 4 <b>Forward</b> Air <b>Control</b> Flight was disbanded on 1 January 1989 and became 'C' Flight of the newly reformed No. 76 Squadron. No. 4 Squadron is the RAAF's current <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> unit.|$|R
25|$|On 1 January 1989 No. 76 Squadron {{was formed}} again at Williamtown as a {{training}} unit equipped with Aermacchi MB-326 jets and CAC Winjeel <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> aircraft. The Aermacchi MB-326s {{were used to}} provide jet aircraft training for pilots who had been selected to fly F/A-18 Hornet or F-111 aircraft {{as well as to}} support Army and Royal Australian Navy exercises. The Winjeels were used for <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> tasks and had previously been operated by No. 4 <b>Forward</b> Air <b>Control</b> Flight before becoming 'C' Flight of No. 76 Squadron upon its formation. In 1995 the Winjeels were replaced with modified Pilatus PC-9 trainers. The squadron's <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> function and aircraft were transferred to the <b>Forward</b> Air <b>Control</b> Development Unit in 2002.|$|R
5|$|During 1958–1960 VAT focused {{increasingly}} on custom-building vehicles {{according to}} customer request. Typically a potential customer just {{walked into the}} main office in Helsinki or factory in Hämeenlinna and described what kind of vehicle he wanted. The enthusiastic engineers listened carefully to every individual customer's wishes and designed vehicles accordingly, {{with two or three}} axles, desired layout, wheelbase and with conventional or <b>forward</b> <b>control</b> cabin. Many vehicle types were only produced for one or two units. The volume model, however, was a nine-tonne variant of the VAK series.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{building}} was a crane for ironware handling. When the frames were taken in, they were fitted with suspension and axles, and then turned the right way up. The next parts were the engine and transmission components. The final part for lorries was a pre-assembled cabin. Conventional bus chassis were delivered with bonnet and wings, but the <b>forward</b> <b>control</b> types left the factory without any body parts. After being painted, the vehicles left the assembly hall. Finally, every vehicle was tested on a -long test run on different roads and with various loads. The bus chassis were tested in a similar way; because there was no body, the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions. The vehicles were handed over to the customers after final adjustments.|$|E
5|$|The company faced a {{difficult}} situation again in 1967 when {{the total number of}} vehicles produced was just 381 units. At the beginning of 1968 VAT fired 40 of the 400 employees. Vanaja had its staunch customer base and the vehicles were generally well regarded but the overall market share remained low; in 1963 just 4–5% of the newly registered heavy lorries in Finland were Vanajas. The highly customised production had led to an excessive diversity of models, which made spare part supply difficult. Moreover, the customising presumably took resources away from technical development work. There was no change for the better although the company introduced its modern <b>forward</b> <b>control</b> model B6-76 which was expected to become the next volume model.|$|E
50|$|<b>Forward</b> air <b>control</b> {{operations}} during World War II were begun as {{an ad hoc}} expedient to wartime conditions. Despite prior close {{air support}} experiences beginning in World War I, the United States had no <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> capability when World War II began. The actual use of <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> during the war began with the Royal Australian Air Force at the Battle of Buna-Gona in November 1942, and with the British Desert Air Force in the North African Campaign the following year. Although <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> techniques were perfected by such units as the 1st Air Commando Group in the CBI Theater, they would be ignored in the war's aftermath.|$|R

25|$|The Series IIB FC {{produced}} from 1966 {{was similar to}} the Series IIA <b>Forward</b> <b>Control</b> but added the 2.25-litre diesel engine as an option. The 2.25-litre engine was the standard engine for this model, the 2.6-litre engine being only available for export.|$|E
25|$|The Leyland 4-tonne {{truck is}} {{conventional}} in layout and design, {{is based on}} a standard C-section chassis and some key components used are shared with the commercial 45 Series light truck. The truck uses the sleeper cab version of the C44 <b>forward</b> <b>control</b> cab, this having room for the driver, two passengers, and stowage for their full kit. As an alternative, the space provided may be used for driver training (the driver plus four personnel) or radio communications equipment.|$|E
25|$|Two {{models that}} have been {{designed}} for military use {{from the ground up}} are the 101 <b>Forward</b> <b>Control</b> from the early 1970s and the Lightweight or Airportable from the late 1960s. The latter was intended to be transported under a helicopter. The Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service (RAFMRS) teams were early users in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and their convoys of Land Rovers and larger military trucks are a sight often seen in the mountain areas of the United Kingdom. Originally RAFMRS Land Rovers had blue bodies and bright yellow tops, to be better seen from above. In 1981, the colour scheme was changed to green with yellow stripes. More recently, vehicles have been painted white, and are issued with fittings similar to civilian UK Mountain Rescue teams.|$|E
50|$|There was a {{great deal}} of {{technical}} innovation in <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> operations during the course of the Vietnam War. The United States came up with a number of ways to make their <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> system more effective. As early as 1962, Douglas C-47 flareship FACs began the <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> mission in South Vietnam, mostly on night missions. In September 1965, another C-47 went into action as the first Airborne Command and Control Center. As additional ABCCC aircraft were added, they would constantly govern the air war in Southeast Asia.|$|R

25|$|The lead-up to the {{operation}} remained politically and militarily tense. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) re-deployed frontline combat aircraft—F/A-18s and F-111s—northward to Tindal in the Northern Territory {{to act as a}} deterrent against escalation of the conflict by the Indonesian military and provide close air support and air defence in support of the landing if required. P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft were also deployed. At peak strength the RAAF aerial support assets available to INTERFET included 10 F-111s, 12 F/A-18s, five P-3C Orions, three B707 aerial refuelling tankers, two B200 King Airs, three PC-9A <b>forward</b> <b>control</b> aircraft, and a Falcon F900 VIP jet. Also in support was a significant airlift group, with Australian transport aircraft including thirteen C-130 Hercules and three DHC-4 Caribou, in addition to a number of New Zealand, British, United States, Canadian, French and Thai aircraft. On at least one occasion Australian P-3C aircraft were intercepted by Indonesian aircraft, while an Indonesian submarine was also detected by Coalition surveillance within the vicinity of Dili Harbour as INTERFET forces approached. Ultimately no serious incidents occurred and the intervention was successful; however, Australia–Indonesia relations would take several years to recover.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{military}} codified their forward {{air control}} (FAC) experience from World War II in 1946, when {{the most recent}} edition of Field Manual 31–35 Air Ground Operations (FM 31–35) was issued for the U.S. Army. The Army Air Force organized its strategic bombers into the Strategic Air Command (SAC), and split its fighters into Air Defense Command (ADC), and Tactical Air Command (TAC). The latter was tasked with close air support (CAS), and thus with forward air control. The Air Force's doctrine, based on Second World War experience called for three necessary conditions for successful close air support. One was gaining air superiority over the enemy. Another was isolating the battlefield via interdiction strikes on a foe's lines of communication. The third was the delivery of air strikes via a forward air control system supporting the Army's ground forces. The Army tended to believe the latter was given the lowest priority by the Air force, and resented it. In 1947, the newly established U.S. Air Force also adopted FM 31–35. However, this failed to set a single forward air control system within the U.S. military. As part {{of the division of}} forces when the Air Force became independent, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps kept their aviation components and their <b>forward</b> <b>control</b> systems. The Army kept its light liaison aircraft and the few helicopters of the era, but was still dependent on the Air Force for most air support, including forward air control.|$|E
500|$|In addition, {{the model}} name [...] "VAT" [...] {{was used for}} two rear-engined bus models: the VAT-4800of which two units were {{produced}} in 1956, and the VAT-5200BDof which ten units were produced in 1957. The next change came in 1961, when an engine manufacturer's code {{was included in the}} model name. For example, the VAK lorry powered by an AEC AVU 470 became the A-47. Correspondingly, the same lorry with a Leyland O.600 diesel became the A-60R; the R stood for raskas (heavy), meaning it had a stronger front axle. The bus model names changed again in the same manner. For example, a <b>forward</b> <b>control</b> bus with the Leyland O.600 engine was called the VLB-60.|$|E

25|$|As the {{fighting}} halted, a joint {{conference of the}} American Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps was held in Seoul to consider future <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> operations. The U.S. Army still wanted its own Air Corps; the U.S. Air Force still insisted on its independence, {{and its ability to}} supply close air support as needed. The end of the Korean War saw no perceptible change in <b>forward</b> air <b>control</b> doctrine from the war's start.
