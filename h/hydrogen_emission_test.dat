40|$|The {{potential}} role {{of molecular}} hydrogen (H- 2) {{as a future}} alternative energy carrier has generated widespread interest. The possible amount of additional <b>hydrogen</b> <b>emission</b> into the atmosphere in a hydrogen-based economy depends on future hydrogen production and leakage rates throughout the complete process chain.

40|$|A {{switch from}} a fossil fuel to a hydrogen-based energy system could cause {{significant}} changes in the magnitude and composition of anthropogenic emissions. Model simulations suggest the most significant impact of these emission changes would occur in the troposphere, affecting OH. This impact is dependent upon the magnitude and nature of trade-offs in changing fossil fuel use. In the stratosphere, changes in water vapour resulting from expected increases in surface molecular <b>hydrogen</b> <b>emissions</b> via leaks occurring during production, transport and storage, are found to be significantly smaller than previous estimates. We conclude that the expected increase in molecular <b>hydrogen</b> <b>emissions</b> is unlikely to have a substantial impact on stratospheric ozone, certainly much smaller than the ozone changes observed in the last two decades...|$|R

40|$|We present NICMOS imaging {{of broad}} band and {{molecular}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>emission</b> in Seyfert galaxies. In 6 of 10 Seyferts we detect resolved or extended emission in the 1 - 0 S(1) 2. 121 or 1 - 0 S(3) 1. 9570 micron molecular hydrogen lines. We did not detect emission {{in the most}} distant galaxy or in the 2 Seyfert 1 galaxies in our sample because of the luminosity of the nuclear point sources. In NGC 5643, NGC 2110 and MKN 1066, molecular <b>hydrogen</b> <b>emission</b> is detected in the extended narrow line region on scales {{of a few hundred}} pc from the nucleus. Emission is coincident with [OIII] and H alpha+[NII] line emission. This emission is also near dust lanes observed in the visible to near-infrared color maps suggesting that a multiphase medium exists near the ionization cones and that the morphology of the line emission is dependent on the density of the ambient media. The high 1 - 0 S(1) or S(3) H 2 to H alpha flux ratio suggests that shock excitation of molecular hydrogen (rather than UV fluorescence) is the dominant excitation process in these extended features. In NGC 2992 and NGC 3227 the molecular <b>hydrogen</b> <b>emission</b> is from 800 and 100 pc diameter `disks' (respectively) which are not directly associated with [OIII] emission and are near high levels of extinction (AV > 10). In NGC 4945 the molecular <b>hydrogen</b> <b>emission</b> appears to be from the edge of a 100 pc superbubble. In these 3 galaxies the molecular gas could be excited by processes associated with local star formation. We confirm previous spectroscopic studies finding that no single mechanism is likely to be responsible for the molecular hydrogen excitation in Seyfert galaxies. Comment: submitted to Ap...|$|R

40|$|Local {{government}} of Jakarta issued a bylaw on air pollution controls for mobile sources, stipulates that all private car owners must get their vehicles’ <b>emission</b> <b>tested</b> biennially. In consequence of non-compliance vehicle in <b>emissions</b> <b>test,</b> vehicle maintenance is essential. Vehicle owner should take an appropriate action {{in order to}} reduce pollutant level lower than standard. This study attempts to analyze economic aspect and emission level considerations come into making optimal choice of vehicle owner. First, we examine the influential factors of action taken in maintenance process of non-compliance vehicle on probability of vehicle to pass the second stage <b>emissions</b> <b>test.</b> Second, due to variation of actions taken in the maintenance process, we analyze impact on cost and explore components affects on variation of maintenance cost.

The bivariate probit model was applied to examine impact of chosen alternatives on the probability to pass Hydrocarbon and Carbon Monoxide in second <b>emission</b> <b>test.</b> To examine variation of maintenance cost and explore components affects on cost, multilevel approach was applied. It is confirm that several actions may increase probability to pass <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> but on the same time reduce average cost. Other actions may simultaneously increase probability to pass <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> and also increase cost. It was also found some actions didn`t have impact on <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> {{but on the other hand}} rise maintenance cost. Furthermore, some actions reduce probability to pass <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> but increase maintenance cost.

40|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>emissions</b> are the {{signature}} of proton aurora. The Doppler-shifted <b>hydrogen</b> <b>emission</b> lines can be inter-preted {{in terms of the}} mean energy of the precipitating pro-tons. A red shifted component of the line profiles observed from the ground indicates upward going hydrogen atoms due to angular redistribution of the precipitation. Secondary elec-trons from ionization and stripping collisions also contribute to the auroral emissions. Since the energy distribution of these secondaries has a lower mean energy than secondary electrons in electron aurora, the relative brightness of emis-sion features differs from that in electron aurora. The secon-daries contribute little to additional ionization. These differ-ences between proton and electron aurora can lead to misin-terpretation when brightness ratios are used to derive iono-spheric conductances with parameterizations that are based on electron aurora. ...|$|R
