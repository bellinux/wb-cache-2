40|$|A Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) utilises an {{electric}} drive and a conventional {{internal combustion engine}} to achieve increased fuel economy and/or performance. The architecture of the vehicle, and the design focus, significantly affects the demands made on the electric drive. These demands are typically expressed as the electric drive duty, in terms of motor speed and torque. This duty can therefore vary significantly for the architecture and vehicle drive cycle selected and {{can have an impact}} on electric drive technology selection. For any given vehicle, there is no simple electric <b>drive</b> <b>rating</b> calculation for the range of hybrid vehicle architectures possible. However, the duty on the electric drive can be determined by a consideration of the whole vehicle power demand. A powertrain simulation model has been used to determine this power demand made on the two sources of traction power, the internal combustion engine and the electric drive, {{as a result of the}} required vehicle dynamics, given by drive cycle velocity and acceleration demand. This model can therefore determine the duty on the electric drive and consequent physical size and rating of the electric drives employed in a selection of different architectures in a given vehicle. In this paper, preliminary results are presented showing the variation in electric drive duty for four architectures with fixed vehicle parameters, over a specified drive cycle. The results are of interest to those involved in hybrid vehicle engineering and electric drives production...|$|E
40|$|In this article, Professor Schwarcz {{examines}} {{the role of}} rating "agencies" in ordering financial markets in the United States and abroad. Though rating agencies are largely unregulated private entities, they significantly influence the global economic system. Recent international proposals regarding the determination of capital adequacy guidelines for the banking industry call for an even greater role for rating agencies. In this light, Professor Schwarcz queries whether market forces provide sufficient restraint on rating agencies or whether public sector regulation is warranted. In the latter case, he also asks whether it is feasible for individual nations to regulate multinational entities of this type. The article initially addresses the functions, origin and terminology of rating agencies. Through the development and nearly universal acceptance of ratings, investors are able to assess the risk attendant to investments in public and privately issued debt securities. The article then addresses the issue of regulation, focusing on the competing regulatory goals of efficiency and distributional interests. Concluding that any regulation of rating agencies should be largely rooted in efficiency concerns, Professor Schwarcz posits that regulation could increase efficiency by either bolstering rating agency performance or mitigating negative consequences of rating agency misbehavior. Professor Schwarcz contends that regulation would not increase efficiency. Rating agency costs are not excessive, nor would increased regulation result in greater ratings reliability. Rating agencies are already motivated to provide accurate and efficient ratings because their profitability is directly tied to reputation. Conversely, additional regulation could possibly subject ratings to political manipulation, thereby impairing ratings reliability. The article also rejects the contention that regulation would mitigate any negative consequences of rating agency misbehavior. Although the practice of requiring issuers {{to pay for a}} rating raises a potential conflict of interest, Professor Schwarcz argues that the risk of misbehavior is minimal and is largely deterred by the potential impact on reputation costs. He also argues that reputation can be a substitute for regulation, and that, at least for rating agencies, reputation drives much of the accountability that ordinarily is achieved through the democratic process. Regulation of rating agencies is also unlikely to resolve their traditionally conservative bias against innovative new financial structures. Government regulation may in fact increase the bias by reducing competition among rating agencies. Moreover, given the international nature of rating agencies and the fact that their assets are human capital, regulation by individual nations could <b>drive</b> <b>rating</b> agencies to relocate to foreign nations that do not impose regulation. Professor Schwarcz concludes that public regulation of rating agencies is an unnecessary and potentially costly policy option. ...|$|E

40|$|Maternally {{inherited}} rickettsial symbionts of {{the genus}} Wolbachia occur commonly in arthropods, often behaving as reproductive parasites by manipulating host reproduction to enhance the vertical transmission of infections. One manipulation is cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which causes {{a significant reduction in}} brood hatch and promotes the spread of the maternally inherited Wolbachia infection into the host population (i. e., cytoplasmic drive). Here, we have examined a Wolbachia superinfection in the mosquito Aedes albopictus and found the infection to be associated with both cytoplasmic incompatibility and increased host fecundity. Relative to uninfected females, infected females live longer, produce more eggs, and have higher hatching rates in compatible crosses. A model describing Wolbachia infection dynamics predicts that increased fecundity will accelerate cytoplasmic <b>drive</b> <b>rates.</b> To test this hypothesis, we used population cages to examine the rate at which Wolbachia invades an uninfected Ae. albopictus population.

40|$|Response {{rates of}} {{auditory}} nerve fibers (ANFs) to electric pulse trains change over time, reflecting substantial spike-rate adaptation {{that depends on}} stimulus parameters. We hypothesize that adaptation affects the representation of amplitude-modulated pulse trains used by cochlear prostheses to transmit speech information to the auditory system. We recorded cat ANF responses to sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) trains with 5, 000 pulse/s carriers. Stimuli delivered by a monopolar intracochlear electrode had fixed modulation frequency (100  Hz) and depth (10 %). ANF responses were assessed by spike-rate measures, while representation of modulation was evaluated by vector strength (VS) and the fundamental component of the fast Fourier transform (F 0 amplitude). These measures were assessed across the 400  ms duration of pulse-train stimuli, a duration relevant to speech stimuli. Different stimulus levels were explored and responses were categorized into four spike-rate groups to assess level effects across ANFs. The temporal pattern of rate adaptation to modulated trains {{was similar to that}} of unmodulated trains, but with less rate adaptation. VS to the modulator increased over time and tended to saturate at lower spike rates, while F 0 amplitude typically decreased over time for low <b>driven</b> <b>rates</b> and increased for higher <b>driven</b> <b>rates.</b> VS at moderate and high spike rates and degree of F 0 amplitude temporal changes at low and moderate spike rates were positively correlated with the degree of rate adaptation. Thus, high-rate carriers will modify the ANF representation of the modulator over time. As the VS and F 0 measures were sensitive to adaptation-related changes over different spike-rate ranges, there is value in assessing both measures...|$|R
