40|$|In this study, the Periotest {{instrument}} {{was used to}} measure the precision of fit between cast high noble-metal frameworks and the supporting implants in a patient-simulation model. Three framework conditions and three implant-location variables were used to evaluate the rigidity of the assembly as measured by the Periotest method. The framework variables were (1) one-piece castings (OPC); (2) sectioned-soldered inaccurate castings (SSIC); and (3) sectioned-soldered accurate castings (SSAC). The implant-location variables were right anterior (RA), center (C), and left anterior (LA). Materials and Methods : The patient simulation model used consisted of three self-tapping BrÅnemark implants in a reasonable arch curvature in bovine bone. Three working casts were fabricated from the patient-simulation model using polyvinyl siloxane and tapered impression copings. From the working casts, three sets of three frameworks were fabricated as OPCs, SSICs, and SSACs using type 3 high noble alloy. The SSICs were fabricated with a quantitative misfit of 101. 6 Μm at the facial surface, between the abutment-to-gold cylinder interface at the C implant location. Periotest value (PTV) measurements were made at the midfacial surface of the frameworks directly above each abutment-to-gold cylinder interface. Three measurements were made for each test condition. The data were analyzed to compare framework condition(s) and implant location(s) using ANOVA and Fisher's Protected Least Significant Difference Comparison Test. Results : The ANOVA showed that significant differences exist between the mean PTV data for <b>framework</b> <b>condition</b> and for implant location (p <. 01). Significant differences were shown between the mean PTV data for the SSAC assemblies and the OPC and SSIC assemblies. The SSICs displayed a more positive (+) mean PTV than the OPCs. The OPC assemblies had a more positive mean PTV than the SSAC assemblies. The mean PTV data for the SSAC assemblies had a significantly different PTV (p <. 01) than the other two <b>framework</b> <b>condition</b> assemblies. The OPC and the SSIC assemblies had PTVs that were not significantly different. The C implant location was significantly different from the RA and the LA implant locations (p <. 01). The RA and the LA implant locations were not significantly different from each other. The C implant location always demonstrated the most positive mean PTV regardless of the <b>framework</b> <b>condition</b> being tested. Conclusions : The Periotest instrument quantified differences in the precision of fit between three framework conditions. The SSAC assemblies were significantly more rigid than the OPC and SSIC assemblies. The OPC and SSIC assemblies' mean PTVs were not significantly different. The mean PTVs for the C implant location and the RA and LA implant locations were significantly different (p <. 01). The mean PTVs of the RA and LA implant locations were not significantly different. The implant-location PTVs followed the same rank order for all three framework conditions. The procedures used to fabricate a more precise fit between the framework and the supporting implants is influenced by the skill of the clinician and technician...|$|E

To simulate thermal building performance appropriate data are required as “standardized weather files”. But as historic weather records cannot be used to model building performance for future climate, synthetic “future weather” data are necessary. Here we present the steps to derive such data for the urban development project “Seestadt Aspern” in Vienna. We start with regional climate simulations with 10 x 10 km grid spacing, where hourly data for years of current and future climate have been extracted for the Aspern area. Micro-scale simulations at 5 m-resolution {{have been carried out}} to consider local influences on urban micro-climate, taking regional simulation results as <b>framework</b> <b>condition.</b> As micro-simulation results are delivered only for single days, transfer functions have been developed to generate synthetic weather records, turning hourly regional climate simulation results into local climate characteristics...|$|E

40|$|The {{socio-economic}} {{and political}} dimensions {{of sustainable development}} have most often been neglected when developing future scenarios. At best, the social dimension has been dealt with as a <b>framework</b> <b>condition</b> for successful environmental sustainability strategies. The institutional one has been discussed regarding integrating the environment into other policies, but hardly as a dimension of sustainability {{in its own right}} (despite the fact that no sustainable development program goes without discussing institutional aspects). For the economic one, the predominance of growth and deregulation has been taken as a given in most cases, instead of developing criteria for economic sustainability. This paper gives a brief sketch of what these dimensions mean for sustainable development. To operationalise them, criteria from all four dimensions must be developed. They have to be incorporated into policy design from the very beginning and on equal footing, if a bias of the results violating the basic concept of sustainable development is to be avoided. For any more general approach it is necessary to integrate criteria of different quality, and to pay due respect to the importance attributed to them by various stakeholders. Standard evaluation methodologies are not capable of handling this situation, in particular the need to simultaneously take a variety of objectives into account (no comparability), and the lack of a common numeraire (no commensurability). A particular challenge to economically educated experts is the fact that no unambiguous optimum exists in multi-dimensional optimisation, but only a range of acceptable solutions can be defined.

Participatory budgets are formal procedures for any city all over the world, independent from their size and number of population. The instrument is very flexible and adaptable to different politico-administrative systems and variable political orientations. It's suitable to the current governance trend of local reforms and can be combined with other instruments of local democracy. The idea of including citizens in the local budgetary decision process was invented first in Brazil in the city of Porto Alegre in 1989 under the name Orçamento Participativo. Since then the idea spread over Brazil, other countries of Latin and North America, Asia, Africa and finally Europe. But according to different legal frameworks, varied socio-economical conditions and diverse political intentions of the supporters of participatory budgets the procedure in different countries is highly specific. Therefore, the main research question of this contribution is to find out, how participatory budgets can be adapted to the legal, political and administrative <b>framework</b> <b>condition</b> at local level in Germany. This includes the question of the possible additional benefit of the procedure for local democracy. However, it has been taken into account, that the data about the conditions and results of participatory budgets in Germany are frequently based only on information of the projects organizers.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{have the}} potential to substitute for conventional vehicles to contribute to the sustainable development of the transportation sector worldwide, for example through the reduction of greenhouse gas and particle emissions. There is international consensus that the improvement of the environmental sustainability by electric vehicles can only be analysed on the basis of life cycle assessment (LCA) including the production, operation and the end of life treatment of these vehicles. Based on the LCA activities in the 18 member countries, the Task 19 “Life Cycle Assessment of Electric Vehicles - From Raw Material Resources to Waste Management of Vehicles with an Electric Drivetrain” of International Energy Agency (IEA) Implementing Agreement on Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (IA-HEV) analysed the LCA based environmental effects of the worldwide electric vehicle fleet in 2014 of about 700, 000 Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). By the end of 2015 it is expected that about 1 million modern vehicles with an electric drive train are on the road worldwide. In the LCA of these vehicles using the different national framework conditions, the environmental effects are estimated by assessing the possible ranges of greenhouse gas emissions (CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O), acidification (NOx, SO 2), ozone formation (NOx, CO, NMVOC, CH 4) and particle matter (PM) emissions in comparison to conventional ICE vehicles (released in 2014). The results show that the environmental effects strongly depend on the national <b>framework</b> <b>condition,</b> i. e., national mix of electricity generation. In some countries a significant reduction of these LCA based emissions of up to 80 %, compared to conventional ICE vehicles, is reached due to a high share of renewable electricity. So there is evidence that under appropriate framework conditions, electric vehicles contribute to a sustainable transportation sector today, and can play a substantial role in the future with the expected increasing renewable electricity generation...|$|E

FishbackThis study {{measured}} {{levels of}} conditions eliciting intrinsic motivation {{to learn and}} examined the correlation of those measures with learner-perceived level of learning. Acquired from adult learners participating in one Midwestern University’s cohort-based degree programs, data helped {{determine the extent to}} which learners perceived the presence of four conditions—inclusion, attitude, meaning, and competence—in both classroom and out-of-classroom learning environments. Additionally, the data helped determine which environment and specific conditions most closely correlated with learner-perceived level of current learning; and provided insight into experiences adult learners found positively or negatively impacting motivation to learn. Surveys were administered in-person to 137 of 150 students within 13 randomly selected cohorts. The survey instrument included a single overall learning attitudinal statement, two Likert scales (classroom and out-of-classroom) each comprised of subscales (inclusion, attitude, meaning, and competence) operationalizing the Motivational Framework for Culturally Responsive Teaching (Framework), a brief demographic section, and a concluding open-ended question regarding experiences impacting motivation to learn. The study used non-parametric analysis to examine dependent variables, motivation conditions, with respect to independent variables; age, gender, race, and degree-level. Additionally, non-parametric analysis examined correlation between condition measures and learner-perceived overall learning. Significant differences were found in two demographic categories. Underrepresented race/ethnicity students (as a combined category) rated overall out-of-classroom conditions higher than predominant race/ethnicity students; and, associate-level students rated classroom conditions lower than bachelors and masters-level students. Significant differences also occurred in subscales. Female students rated classroom attitude conditions higher than males; underrepresented students rated classroom attitude and competence, and out-of-classroom attitude, meaning, and competence, higher than predominant students; associates-level students rated classroom inclusion lower than both bachelors and masters-level students; and both associates and masters-level students rated classroom competence lower than bachelors-level students. All conditions, in both environments (classroom and out-of-classroom), were significantly correlated with learner-perceived level of learning; and the classroom scale demonstrated considerably stronger correlation than did the out-of-classroom scale. Of all subscales, both classroom and out-of-classroom meaning demonstrated the strongest correlation with learner-perceived level of learning. Forty-eight respondents (35 % of sample) offered responses to the survey’s concluding statement. Of those respondents offering comments in regard to classroom motivation, instructor characteristics were most often noted. And, of those commenting on out-of-classroom motivation, team formulation and characteristics were predominant. Through the creation of the Motivation Conditions in Learning Instrument™, this study produced benchmark measures for each <b>Framework</b> <b>condition</b> experienced in both cohort-based classrooms and out-of-classroom team learning; identified differences in measures across demographic categories; and identified correlation of measures with learner-perceived level of learning.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is concerned with}} the geographic analysis of the Internet infrastructure and its impacts on the economic development of the city-regions. The starting point for this research is the infrastructural attributes of the Internet which enables it to facilitate the modern – and rapidly expanded – digital economy by transporting its informational goods and services. In order to approach this research subject a wide range of quantitative methods is employed: from network analysis and complex network theory to principal components and cluster analysis as well as panel data analysis and Granger causality test. The empirical research is firstly focused on analysing the urban economic geography of the Internet backbone network in Europe. In order to better understand the geography and the topology of the Internet backbone network, a structural comparison with the aviation networks in Europe also takes place. Secondly, effort is spent in highlighting the determinant geographic and socio-economic factors behind the distribution of this Internet infrastructure across the European city-regions. Thirdly, this study examines the impact of the – unevenly distributed – Internet infrastructure on the economic development of the European city-regions. The above empirical analysis highlighted the unequal distribution of the Internet infrastructure and mostly the Internet capacity across the European cities. Different roles were identified for different cities, but over time the golden diamond of London, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt appears to be the core of the European Internet backbone network, with London being the dominant hub. However, no clear evidence for scale free attributes was identified. Moreover, the analysis demonstrated that the level of development, the services and the knowledge economy, the spatial structure as well as the physical transport and accessibility level are significant predictors of the distribution of the Internet infrastructure. In addition, the econometric modelling concluded that the Internet infrastructure is a significant predictor of the economic development of the city-regions and that the causality runs from the Internet infrastructure to the regional economic development. Even more interesting is the geographic analysis of the causality direction as an almost north-south pattern emerged, with the northern city-regions in Europe being more efficient in exploiting the installed Internet infrastructure. The latter can be used as an evidence for the inclusion of the Internet infrastructure in the local and regional economic development agenda. However, a set of other <b>framework</b> <b>condition</b> should be also present in order for the Internet infrastructure to {{have a positive impact on}} the regional economic development.

However, with the support and effort of government in promoting the {{application of}} RWH in building, the number of building using the RWH is increased gradually. The system has been applied for various types of building such as housing, institutional and commercial. Even though the application of RWH is ongoing, there is no specific guideline in maintaining RWH. Maintenance performance is the key aspect in sustaining the RWH system. With the initial investment in installing the RWH, the organization {{must be able to}} monitor their investment in the form of maintenance performance. This will ensure the building owner achieve the value for money. The physical condition of RWH supports the ideas in tracking maintenance performance as a whole. Therefore, this research focuses on the improvement of maintenance management of RWH system with focusing on maintenance performance in Malaysia. This research used quantitative approach for data collection and data analysis. The conceptual framework of rainwater harvesting (RWH) system has been established before collection of the main data. There were two instruments implemented in this research namely physical condition survey and questionnaire survey. These instruments were developed based on the outlined conceptual <b>framework.</b> <b>Condition</b> survey has been carrying out to 16 buildings throughout the Peninsular Malaysia, and the data was analysed using CSP 1 matrix. The results show only two buildings rated as dilapidated while fourteen buildings rated as good and fair. Questionnaire survey was distributed to three respondents for each building. A total of 48 respondents throughout Peninsular Malaysia were involved in the data collection. The data obtained later form a database and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The results of difficulties in maintaining RWH system in the building shows mean score less than 2. 0, which consider as low. Both results demonstrated cross-combination finding via maintenance performance quadrant at the end of analysis and shows majority of buildings need improvement in terms of their maintenance management, while only two buildings regarded has as bad practice, which needs total refurbishment for the RWH system as well as the management. In conclusion, the physical condition of the RWH system is regarded good and safe implemented in the buildings. However, the maintenance of the system can be improved with a proper guideline and management policy by the organization involved. This is to ensure that the maximum value of installing the RWH system as well as ensuring the system performs to its intended design throughout the building’s lifetime...|$|E
40|$|By using {{sediment}} archives {{along the}} coast of Bonaire (Leeward Antilles; political status: special municipality of the Netherlands), such as bokas (enclosed lagoons), narrow floodplains and mangrove swamps, and by investigating supralittoral blocks and boulders, the goal of this thesis is (i) to identify prehistoric high-energy wave events, (ii) to differentiate between extraordinary storms and tsunamis, and (iii) to date these events. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal impact of high-energy wave events on coastal geo-ecosystems is evaluated. A total of 45 vibracores (max. depth 11 m) and push cores (max. depth 1. 62 m) was taken from all around the island (Lagun, Boka Washikemba, Lac Baai, Saliña Tam, Klein Bonaire, Boka Funchi, Wayaka, Boka Bartol, Playa Grandi). Cores from the most promising locations were investigated in terms of sedimentology, geochemistry, mineralogy and faunal remains. The coasts of the Caribbean Sea are prone to tsunami hazard, proven by numerous observed events of the last 500 years. Bonaire was chosen as the site of interest for this study due to the antagonism of a total lack of historical accounts on tsunami occurrence and its massive record of coarse-clast coastal landforms and single blocks and boulders, which are attributed to deposition by extreme wave events (tsunamis, hurricanes). The largest coastal blocks were studied as evidence for the occurrence of more powerful waves than those of strong tropical cyclones (locally known as hurricanes). By comparing calculated minimum storm wave heights required to quarry and move the largest blocks of Spelonk and Boka Olivia on northeastern Bonaire, with maximum wave heights observed during recent high-category hurricanes and the buoy record, little doubt remains that one or more major tsunamis occurred in Mid- to Late Holocene times. This confirmation of the previously established (and in the meantime challenged) tsunami hypothesis provides a very important <b>framework</b> <b>condition</b> for the interpretation of the subsurface overwash deposits in the coastal stratigraphical archives. A tentative chronology of tsunami occurrence was established, based on a comparison of subsurface overwash deposits identified in the sediment cores from the stratigraphical geoarchives with characteristic signature types of modern tsunamis and calibrated 14 C data. Uncertainties in sediment interpretation, associated with {{the fact that most of}} these signature types may also occur in storm deposits, were reduced according to (i) the results from the numerical boulder study, (ii) the high tsunami potential of the southern Caribbean (abundant potential tsunami trigger mechanisms), (iii) the identification of sediment source areas which are out of reach for storm waves, and (iv) the lack of littoral and marine sand/mud input during recent high-category hurricanes. Several sites reflect long-lasting environmental change subsequent to palaeotsunami impact. At the open embayment of Lagun, this is confirmed by palynological investigations. Pollen spectra prior to the wave impact are dominated by mangrove types (Rhizophora), whereas significantly lower percentage of Rhizophora pollen was detected in the post-tsunami samples. Mangroves seem to have only gradually recovered from the impact, probably on centennial scales. In contrast to Lagun, the bokas and saliñas of Bonaire are cut off from the sea by a quasi-impermeable barrier of beachrock and coral rubble. The candidate tsunami deposit of Boka Bartol is vertically confined by mangrove peat (below) and evaporite-rich mud (above). This pattern is interpreted as the transformation of an open mangrove-fringed embayment (pre-tsunami) into a poly- to hypersaline lagoon (post-tsunami) due to the establishment or closure of the barrier of coral material during the event. The high amount of gypsum and halite crystals and thin layers of inorganic carbonate are the result of limited water input and high evapotranspiration rates during the dry season. The absence of marine faunal remains also indicates very limited exchange with the ocean. The chronology of potential tsunamis based on data from the sediment cores starts with extreme wave event I (EWE I), around 3600 BP, represented by a carbonate sand deposit bracketedby man-grove peat, which was found on Klein Bonaire. A well-preserved candidate tsunami deposit from Boka Bartol with a maximum age of 3300 BP (EWE II) has counterparts on the leeward coast (Klein Bonaire, Saliña Tam, possibly between Saliña Tam and Punt’i Wekua) and the windward coast (Playa Grandi, possibly Boka Washikemba). EWE II can be identified as the best-documented candidate palaeotsunami on Bonaire. EWE XII, with a maximum age of 2000 BP, left massive shell-dominated deposits at Lagun (windward side) and carbonate sands at Saliña Tam, both of which were interpreted as tsunamigenic. Deposits of another younger, unspecified EWE XVI (pre- 500 BP) were found between Saliña Tam and Punt’i Wekua, and Boka Washikemba. Based on these results, a preliminary estimation of the recurrence interval of high-energy wave events on Bonaire, which reveal magnitudes significantly exceeding those of recent high-category hurricanes and which are therefore likely to be major tsunamis, is in the order of roughly 1000 years or less. This study corroborates conclusions of predecessor studies that the hazard of tsunami does exist on Bonaire, although historical accounts on tsunami ocurrence are lacking. It is strongly suggested to the authorities of Bonaire, to conduct a local analysis of tsunami risk, similar to the one recently established for the neighbour island of Curaçao. A study of modelling tsunami inundation based on the spectrum of tsunami triggering mechanisms and past inundation inferred from the overwash deposits identified in this research may be useful to determine high-risk areas, which are prone to potential future tsunami damage. ...|$|E
