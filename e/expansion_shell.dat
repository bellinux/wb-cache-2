A point anchor bolt is a metal bar between 20 mm - 25 mm in diameter, and between 1 m - 4 m long (the size is {{determined}} by the mine's engineering department). There is an <b>expansion</b> <b>shell</b> {{at the end of the}} bolt which is inserted into the hole.

40|$|The {{basic type}} of rock mass {{reinforcement}} method for both preparatory and operational workings in underground metal ore mines, both in Poland {{and in different}} countries across the world, is the <b>expansion</b> <b>shell</b> or adhesive-bonded rock bolt. The article discusses results of static loading test of the <b>expansion</b> <b>shell</b> rock bolts equipped with originally developed deformable component. This component consists of two profiled rock bolt washers, two disk springs, and three guide bars. The disk spring and disk washer material differs in stiffness. The construction materials ensure that at first the springs under loading are partially compressed, and then the rock bolt washer is plastically deformed. The rock bolts tested were installed in blocks simulating a rock mass with rock compressive strength of 80 MPa. The rock bolt was loaded statically until its ultimate loading capacity was exceeded. The study presents the results obtained under laboratory conditions in the test rig allowing testing of the rock bolts at their natural size, as used in underground metal ore mines. The stress-strain/displacement characteristics of the <b>expansion</b> <b>shell</b> rock bolt with the deformable component were determined experimentally. The relationships between the geometric parameters and specific strains or displacements of the bolt rod were described, and the percentage contribution of those values in total displacements, resulting from the deformation of rock bolt support components (washer, thread) and the <b>expansion</b> <b>shell</b> head displacements, were estimated. The stiffness of the yielded and stiff bolts was empirically determined, including stiffness parameters of every individual part (deformable component, steel rod).

The aim of our study was to assess the outcomes of total hip replace-ment with the uncemented CLS <b>expansion</b> <b>shell</b> and a structural femoral head autograft to augment the deficient acetabulum in patients with osteoarthritis secondary to congenital hip disease. Methods: Between 1990 and 1994, we used a CLS <b>expansion</b> <b>shell</b> with a structural femoral head autograft in forty-three consecutive patients (forty-three hips) with osteoarthritis secondary to congenital hip disease. The ratio of male to female patients was 5 : 38, and {{the mean age of the}} patients was forty-eight years. According to the preoperative radiographic assessment, the dysplasia was categorized as Crowe type I in six patients, Crowe type II in thirty-one pa-tients, and Crowe type III and type IV in three patients each. No patient was lost to follow-up. The mean duration of follow-up was 120 months. Plain radiographs were made immediately after surgery and at the latest follow-up evalua-tion. Clinical outcomes were determined with use of the Harris hip score and the Merle d’Aubigné and Postel score, and a radiographic analysis was performed.

We studied six species of gastropods at ‘Evolution Canyons I and II ’ in Carmel and the Galilee Mountains, Israel, respectively. The xeric, south-facing, ‘African ’ slopes and the mesic, north-facing, ‘European ’ slopes have dramatically different microclimates and plant communities. Moreover, ‘Evolution Canyon II ’ receives more rainfall than ‘Evolution Canyon I. ’ Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined fluctuating asymmetry, rate of whorl <b>expansion,</b> <b>shell</b> height, {{and number of}} rotations of the body suture in six species of terrestrial snails from the two ‘Evolution Canyons. ’ The xeric ‘African ’ slope should be more stressful to land snails than the ‘European ’ slope, and ‘Evolution Canyon I ’ should be more stressful than ‘Evolution Canyon II. ’ Only Eopolita protensa jebusitica showed marginally significant differences in fluctuating helical asymmetry between the two slopes.

We describe a novel Raman dynamic probe of hydrogen-isotope exchange to investigate directly these protein folding/assembly pathways.
