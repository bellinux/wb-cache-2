40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} cooperative relations among incumbents {{in the formation of}} new firms. We argue that cooperative interfirm relations that bridge geographically remote and diverse sources of knowledge—cross-cutting ties—contribute to new firm formation. Employing data on state-level entries into the U. S. biotech industry from 1994 to 1998, we find support for the following hypotheses: the formation of new firms in a focal region of an industry is positively related to the number <b>of</b> <b>cross-cutting</b> ties; the number <b>of</b> <b>cross-cutting</b> ties negatively moderates the effects of organizational density on the formation of new firms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Social {{scientists}} often attribute moderation of {{the political}} salience of ethnicity, in ethnically diverse societies, to the presence <b>of</b> <b>cross-cutting</b> cleavages—that is, to dimensions of identity or interest along which {{members of the same}} ethnic group may have diverse allegiances. Yet estimating the causal effects <b>of</b> <b>cross-cutting</b> cleavages is difficult. In this paper, we present experimental results that help to explain why ethnicity appears to have little political salience in Mali, an ethnically heterogeneous sub-Saharan African country in which ethnic identity is a poor predictor of vote choice and parties do not form along ethnic lines. We argue that the cross-cutting ties afforded by an informal institution calle...|$|R

By Matlab simulation experiment, the data demonstrates nonlinearity complex system can be identified fast and effectively by neural network. The predicted time of the model is 97 ms with the control precision within 0 - 2 mm hitting 89 %, proving that the model can fully fulfil production demands regarding precision and pace and prove that probability that BP neural network is used in precision compensation <b>of</b> <b>cross-cutting</b> line modeling shear...|$|R

5000|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>cross-cutting</b> {{cleavages}} {{is perhaps}} most heavily used in the field <b>of</b> Political Science. <b>Cross-cutting</b> cleavages were originally suggested as a mechanism for political stability, as no group can align all its members along a uniform cleavage-based platform, but rather has to appeal {{to members of the}} group that are spread throughout the groups created by other cleavages. The most in-depth discussion of this process is that by Seymour Martin Lipset in his 1960 book Political Man.|$|R

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of destroyed paper documents is of more interest {{during the last}} years. This topic is relevant to the fields of forensics, investigative sciences, and archeology. Previous research and analysis on the reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>cross-cut</b> shredded text document (RCCSTD) are mainly based on the likelihood and the traditional heuristic algorithm. In this paper, a feature-matching algorithm based on the character recognition via establishing the database of the letters is presented, reconstructing the shredded document by row clustering, intrarow splicing, and interrow splicing. Row clustering is executed through the clustering algorithm according to the clustering vectors of the fragments. Intrarow splicing regarded as the travelling salesman problem is solved by the improved genetic algorithm. Finally, the document is reconstructed by the interrow splicing according to the line spacing and {{the proximity of the}} fragments. Computational experiments suggest that the presented algorithm is of high precision and efficiency, and that the algorithm may be useful for the different size <b>of</b> <b>cross-cut</b> shredded text document...|$|R

40|$|Requirements such as {{distribution}} or tracing have {{an impact}} on multiple classes in a system. They are cross-cutting requirements, or aspects. Their support is, by necessity, scattered across those multiple classes. A look at an individual class may also show support for cross-cutting requirements tangled up with the core responsibilities of that class. Scattering and tangling make object-oriented software difficult to understand, extend and reuse. Though design is an important activity within the software lifecycle with well-documented benefits, those benefits are reduced when cross-cutting requirements are present. This paper presents a means to mitigate these problems by separating the design <b>of</b> <b>cross-cutting</b> requirements into composition patterns. Composition patterns require extensions to the UML, and are based on a combination of the subjectoriented model for composing separate, overlapping designs, and UML templates. This paper also demonstrates how composition patterns map to one programming model that provides a solution for separation <b>of</b> <b>cross-cutting</b> requirements in code [...] -aspect-oriented programming. This mapping serves to illustrate that separation of aspects may be maintained throughout the software lifecycle...|$|R

40|$|Aspect {{oriented}} programming {{has been}} proposed {{as a way to}} improve modularity of software systems by allowing encapsulation <b>of</b> <b>cross-cutting</b> concerns. To do so, aspects specify where new functionality should apply using pointcuts.

This is a major obstacle for evolution of aspect oriented software. In this paper we introduce a pointcut delta analysis to lighten these problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Literature on the {{integration}} <b>of</b> <b>cross-cutting</b> issues, or policy integration, has given {{little attention to}} how policy-making processes allow for policy integration as well as present barriers. There is also little evidence of how sectoral ministries respond to crosscutting issues and in what way they are affected by pressure to address such issues, including those promoted by ‘competing’ agencies. Climate change presents a significant and important issue for integration into many areas of public policy. Many government ministries and departments are tasked with responding to climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. Forestry is a key sector in building a response to climate change and so an investigation into how policy-makers and policy-making processes have responded to climate change can shed light on {{the integration}} <b>of</b> <b>cross-cutting</b> issues. The thesis reports on investigation into how the Ministry of Forestry, Indonesia, has responded to climate change and into the organisational arrangements developed in the response to climate change. The research developed an innovative framework for the analysis of policy integration, generating conclusions in relation to the policy process, organisational arrangements and the influence of key actors, including policy champions and boundary spanners...|$|R
