40|$|This {{paper and}} a {{companion}} article present illustrated guides to the identification of sub-fossil chironomid larvae (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae) preserved in the sediments of low- and mid-elevation lakes in East Africa. They are based on analysis of surface-sediment death assemblages from 61 lakes located in the humid to semi-arid environments of equatorial East Africa (Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania), supplemented with similar surface-sediment samples from 12 lakes in the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia), and sub-recent core samples from six lakes in Kenya and two in Uganda. We analyzed about 11, 000 specimens and identified 98. 4 % of these to species, species group, genus, or tribe level depending on current alpha-taxonomic knowledge of the various genera considered and the taxonomic resolution of preserved diagnostic features. We distinguished 90 different sub-fossil morphotypes, of which 16 are Tanypodinae, 19 are Orthocladiinae, and 55 are Chironominae. Diagnostic characters distinguishing these morphotypes from each other resemble differences at the species level in the better-known Holarctic fauna, hence we consider most of our morphotypes equivalent to morphological species or groups of closely related species. In this paper {{we focus on the}} Tanypodinae and Orthocladiinae, with special attention to the <b>high</b> <b>taxon</b> richness among the Pentaneurini. Patterns of cephalic setation were found to facilitate identification of Tanypodinae both at the genus and species level, and contributed to improved taxonomic resolution in sub-fossil East African material. <b>High</b> <b>taxon</b> richness and numerical abundance of the Orthocladiinae in our study lakes indicates that a considerable number of African Orthocladiinae is adapted to warm standing-water environments...|$|R

This process, first studied by Yule, is a linear preferential attachment process, since the rate at which genera accrue new species is linear in the number they already have.|$|E

50|$|Since 1969, life {{on earth}} was {{classified}} into five kingdoms, as introduced by Robert Whittaker. Margulis became the most important supporter, as well as critic - while supporting parts, {{she was the first}} to recognize the limitations of Whittaker's classification of microbes. But later discoveries of new organisms, such as archaea, and emergence of molecular taxonomy challenged the concept. By the mid-2000s, most scientists began to agree that there are more than five kingdoms. Margulis became the most important defender of the five kingdom classification. She rejected the three-domain system introduced by Carl Woese in 1990, which gained wide acceptance. She introduced a modified classification by which all life forms, including the newly discovered, could be integrated into the classical five kingdoms. According to her the main problem, archaea, falls under the kingdom Prokaryotae alongside bacteria (in contrast to the three-domain system, which treats archaea as a <b>higher</b> <b>taxon</b> than kingdom, or the six-kingdom system, which holds that it is a separate kingdom).

50|$|The {{basic problem}} in {{morphological}} phylogenetics is {{the assembly of}} a matrix representing a mapping {{from each of the}} taxa being compared to representative measurements for each of the phenotypic characteristics being used as a classifier. The types of phenotypic data used to construct this matrix depend on the taxa being compared; for individual species, they may involve measurements of average body size, lengths or sizes of particular bones or other physical features, or even behavioral manifestations. Of course, since not every possible phenotypic characteristic could be measured and encoded for analysis, the selection of which features to measure is a major inherent obstacle to the method. The decision of which traits to use as a basis for the matrix necessarily represents a hypothesis about which traits of a species or <b>higher</b> <b>taxon</b> are evolutionarily relevant. Morphological studies can be confounded by examples of convergent evolution of phenotypes. A major challenge in constructing useful classes is the high likelihood of inter-taxon overlap in the distribution of the phenotype's variation. The inclusion of extinct taxa in morphological analysis is often difficult due to absence of or incomplete fossil records, but has been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the trees produced; in one study only the inclusion of extinct species of apes produced a morphologically derived tree that was consistent with that produced from molecular data.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Since the {{discovery}} of the "living fossil" in 1938, the coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) has generally been considered to be the closest living relative of the land vertebrates, and this is still the prevailing opinion in most general biology textbooks. However, the origin of tetrapods has not been resolved for decades. Three principal hypotheses (lungfish-tetrapod, coelacanth-tetrapod, or lungfish-coelacanth sister group) have been proposed. Findings We used the Bayesian method under the coalescence model with the latest published program (Bayesian Estimation of Species Trees, or BEST) to perform a phylogenetic analysis for seven relevant taxa and 43 nuclear protein-coding genes with the jackknife method for taxon sub-sampling. The lungfish-coelacanth sister group was consistently reconstructed with the Bayesian method under the coalescence model in 17 out of 21 taxon sets with a Bayesian posterior probability as high as 99 %. Lungfish-tetrapod was only inferred from BCLS and BACLS. Neither coelacanth-tetrapod nor lungfish-coelacanth-tetrapod was recovered out of all 21 taxon sets. Conclusions Our results provide strong evidence in favor of accepting the hypothesis that lungfishes and coelacanths form a monophyletic sister-group that is the closest living relative of tetrapods. This clade was supported by high Bayesian posterior probabilities of the branch (a lungfish-coelacanth clade) and <b>high</b> <b>taxon</b> jackknife supports. </p...|$|R

We suggest this is the result of Lophelia outcompeting other coral types because there is increased coral taxon richness in areas without Lophelia.

The use of mitochondrial data sequences from large numbers of mammals could serve to circumvent the taxon-sampling deficit.

We undertook the analyses at both reach and catchment scales to explore whether inferences depended on scale of observation. Results We hypothesized that ﬂ†diversity would make a large contribution to the ? diversity of macroinvertebrates in our dendritic riverine landscape, particularly at the larger spatial scale (among catchments) because of limited dispersal among sites and especially among catchments. However, reaches each had relatively <b>high</b> <b>taxon</b> richness and <b>high</b> a diversity, while ﬂ†diversity made only a small contribution to ? diversity at both the reach and catchment scales. Main conclusions Dendritic riverine landscapes have been thought to generate high ﬂ†diversity {{as a consequence of}} limited dispersal and high heterogeneity among individual streams, but this may not hold for all headwater stream systems. Here, a diversity was high and ﬂ†diversity low, with individual headwater stream reaches each containing a large portion of ? diversity. Thus, each stream could be considered to have low irreplaceability since losing the option to use one of these sites in a representative reserve network does not greatly diminish the options available for completing the reserve network. Where limited information on individual taxonomic distributions is available, or time and money for modelling approaches are limited, diversity partitioning may provide a useful 'first-cut' for obtaining information about the irreplaceability of individual streams or subcatchments when establishing representative freshwater reserves.

40|$|Organisms {{living in}} {{or on the}} {{sediment}} layer of water bodies constitute the benthos fauna, which is known to harbour {{a large number of}} species of diverse taxonomic groups. The benthos plays {{a significant role in the}} nutrient cycle and it is, therefore, of high ecological relevance. Here, we have explored a DNA-taxonomic approach to access the meiobenthic organismic diversity, by focusing on obtaining signature sequences from a part of the large ribosomal subunit rRNA (28 S), the D 3 ‚ÄìD 5 region. To obtain a broad representation of taxa, benthos samples were taken from 12 lakes in Germany, representing different ecological conditions. In a first approach, we have extracted whole DNA from these samples, amplified the respective fragment by PCR, cloned the fragments and sequenced individual clones. However, we found a relatively large number of recombinant clones that must be considered PCR artefacts. In a second approach we have, therefore, directly sequenced PCR fragments that were obtained from DNA extracts of randomly picked individual organisms. In total, we have obtained 264 new unique sequences, which can be readily placed into taxon groups, based on phylogenetic comparison with currently available database sequences. The group with the <b>highest</b> <b>taxon</b> abundance were nematodes and protozoa, followed by chironomids. However, we find also that we have by far not exhausted the diversity of organisms in the samples. Still, our data provide a framework within which a meiobenthos DNA signature sequence database can be constructed, that will allow to develop the necessary techniques for studying taxon diversity in the context of ecological analysis. Since many taxa in our analysis are initially only identified via their signature sequences, but not yet their morphology, we propose to call this approach ‚Äòreverse taxonomy‚Äô...|$|R
