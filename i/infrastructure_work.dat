5|$|The {{financing}} plan involved {{public and private}} funding. At the time, the city planned to pay $75million for the acquisition {{of the land and}} construction of the stadium project. However, a 2017 audit revealed that it had actually paid $91million after accounting for additional costs associated with the expedited schedule and <b>infrastructure</b> <b>work</b> around the project site. The stadium is owned by the city and is leased to the team for 30years, until 2045. The Sounds ownership group spent $50million on a new, mixed-use and retail development next to the facility. The construction of two apartment buildings with retail space beyond the left field wall is scheduled to be completed in early 2018. North of the site, Embrey Development Corp. built a privately funded apartment complex called The Carillon. The city's original $75million planned expenditure resulted in taking on $4.3million in annual debt, paid for by five city revenue streams: an annual $700,000 Sounds' lease payment, $650,000 in stadium-generated sales tax revenue, $750,000 in property taxes from the Sounds development, $675,000 in property taxes from the Embrey development, and $520,000 in tax increment financing. The additional overage was paid with existing Metro capital funds. The city pays $345,000 for annual maintenance of the stadium.|$|E

40|$|The Italian noise {{legislation}} {{is based on}} the principle of protection of the population exposed to several type of noise sources. The noise exposure, beyond the direct effects on the auditive apparatus, could cause sleep disturbance, speech intelligibility, psycho physiological effects, that generate important state of annoyance. The real goal of the noise {{legislation is}} to reduce annoyance. Such legislation, however, is not sufficient for particular type of noise sources, like those generated by <b>infrastructure</b> <b>works.</b> In these cases the law gives authorisation notwithstanding the provisions in force, exceeding the limit values, but without creating damage conditions. The local authorities should then manage these derogations by characterizing the parameters {{that could be used to}} take under control the noise, and then to avoid several state of annoyance. The purpose of this study is to take into account the parameters that have been identified and to set up guidelines aimed to establish limit values for derogation for the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>works.</b> The first step will be to distinguish between the different noise produced by different type of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>works.</b> The limit values will then be different for building or street yard and for great <b>infrastructure</b> <b>works</b> such as tunnel or high-speed way construction. The main differences are the plants and the machinery used for the works, but in particular the duration of the work. The limits will then be more rigid for the long time <b>infrastructure</b> <b>works,</b> which are often active also in the night, because of a longer population exposure. These guidelines will be finally discussed with the local authorities in order to manage the noise produced by the temporary <b>infrastructure</b> <b>works</b> and to avoid the worsening of the quality of life...|$|R

25|$|Congress {{approved}} {{the construction of}} parkways {{on both sides of}} the Potomac River from Great Falls to Fort Washington and Mount Vernon in Maryland and Virginia, respectively, in 1930. Construction on what was originally named the George Washington Memorial Parkway on the Maryland side of the Potomac River was underway by 1961. The parkway was completed from its western end at MacArthur Boulevard to the interchange with Cabin John Parkway, which was not yet completed, in 1964. In 1965, the parkway opened from Cabin John east to the Glen Echo interchange. Extensions of the George Washington Memorial Parkway were proposed in both directions. From the west end, the parkway was to extend to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park site at Great Falls. Going east, the parkway would continue to Georgetown, where it would tie into the western end of the Whitehurst Freeway at its junction with the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The unused bridge at the Glen Echo interchange was constructed and preliminary <b>infrastructure</b> <b>work</b> was done east of the interchange in anticipation of constructing a second carriageway east toward Georgetown. The plans to extend the parkway to Great Falls and Georgetown were abandoned by 1969. The parkway was completed in its present form from the Glen Echo interchange to the Chain Bridge in 1973. Maryland's version of the George Washington Memorial Parkway was renamed for Clara Barton in 1989.|$|E

500|$|A second hourly {{service to}} Newport is {{proposed}} for the line. A South East Wales Transport Alliance (Sewta) report in 2006 noted that additional <b>infrastructure</b> <b>work</b> [...] {{would be required to}} enable the service to become half-hourly (one train running to Cardiff and another to Newport). An additional seven miles (11km) of double track would be needed between Aberbeeg Junction and Crosskeys and additional platforms at Newbridge and Llanhilleth stations would be required. According to Network Rail, the points system at Gaer junction would need to be replaced before the line could be linked from Rogerstone station to Newport station. Major resignalling works would also need to be carried out. Passenger trains travel faster than freight trains, so the signals need to be further apart. The Welsh Assembly Government announced in July 2009 that the relevant works to enable direct trains between Ebbw Vale and Newport would be complete by 2011. Work on the track at Gaer Junction, Newport – connecting the Ebbw Valley Railway to Newport – had been scheduled for completion by October 2010, but no decision on the link will now be made before March 2011.|$|E
