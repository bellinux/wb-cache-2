5|$|Cleanup efforts {{after the}} storm were hastened as Hurricane Gonzalo {{approached}} from the south, amid concerns that strewn debris from Fay could become airborne and exacerbate future destruction. The unanticipated heavy damage from Fay prompted residents to prepare more thoroughly for Gonzalo, as evidenced by stores reporting an influx of customers purchasing emergency supplies. Two hundred Bermuda Regiment soldiers helped clear debris and began repairing structural damage. On October 13, crews of soldiers put tarpaulins on 30 <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> roof damage, as well as distributing another 150 tarps to homeowners.|$|E

5|$|October 24, 2005– Hurricane Wilma makes {{landfall}} near Cape Romano {{as a major}} hurricane, producing hurricane-force {{winds and}} moderate precipitation across much of southern portion of the state.

5|$|Widespread {{flooding}} and gusty winds destroyed 204 houses along the southeast Texas coastline, {{most of which}} occurred in Matagorda County. In addition, the winds damaged 1,407 <b>homes,</b> <b>with</b> 144 of them being severely damaged. The wind also affected 147 businesses, of which 64 were either destroyed or severely damaged. Strong winds downed numerous power lines, leaving around 74,000 residents without power in the immediate aftermath. Overall, Claudette caused $180million (2003USD, $ USD) in damage in Texas and one death from a fallen tree during the storm.

5|$|Work began almost {{immediately}} {{to prepare for}} the expansion of the town. A full master plan was in place by 1949. This envisaged an increase in the population of the town to 50,000, residential properties in nine neighbourhoods radiating from the town centre, and a separate industrial area to the north. The neighbourhoods would consist mainly of three-bedroom family <b>homes,</b> <b>with</b> a number of smaller and larger properties. Each would be built around a centre with shops, a church, a public house, a primary school and a community centre. Secondary education was to be provided at campuses at Ifield Green, Three Bridges and Tilgate. Later, a fourth campus, in Southgate, was added to the plans.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{repair and}} recovery plan was {{enacted by the}} Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation, with {{more than two-thirds of}} it not being funded by the final plan report on March4. Of the NZ$15million (US$10.6million) in home damage, NZ$7.2million (US$5.1million) was covered. New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5million (US$3.9million) grant to assist in this effort. Priority was placed on repairing damaged <b>homes,</b> <b>with</b> lesser emphasis on destroyed ones. Labor costs would ultimately reach NZ$6million (US$4.2million) for this project. Finalization of the funding for reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early June, with some residents still living in tents. Farmers were provided with NZ$195,000 (US$138,000) worth of seeds, seedlings, and various supplies to jump-start agricultural recovery. Since the majority of the island's electrical grid was destroyed, an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor.|$|E

Anticipating high winds, residents tied down <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> rope and wire and boarded up windows with shutters. Similar preparations took place on Rarotonga, though the main concern there was storm surge. Government offices and schools there were closed on February11. Most residents and all tourists along the coast in Aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters. Authorities later announced that they were under-prepared for Cyclone Pat. The lack of an official process during an emergency was cited as a core issue.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 {{there were}} {{estimated}} to be 2.37 million households in Scotland. Of these approximately 1.5 million (62.5 per cent) were owner-occupied homes, 319,000 (12.7 per cent) homes rented from local authorities, 305,000 (11.5 per cent) privately rented homes, and 277,000 (11.5 per cent) homes rented from housing associations. The total number had increased by around 173,000 (7.9 per cent) over the previous ten years, with {{the rate of increase}} having slowed substantially {{since the start of the}} economic downturn in 2007. The rate of growth in households was affected by falls in new housing supply (which includes new builds, refurbishments and conversions). This fell in each year from 2008–09 to 2010–11, from around 27,600 units in 2007–08 to 17,100 units in 2010–11. The number of households increased after 2010 in every local authority except Clackmannanshire, Inverclyde and West Dunbartonshire. The area with the greatest increase since 2001 in percentage terms was Aberdeenshire with an additional 13,800 households (15.2 per cent). Edinburgh City saw the largest absolute increase of 17,000 households (8.3 per cent).

Strong winds downed trees and destroyed many advertisement signs.

In La Paz, 300families received damage to their <b>homes,</b> <b>with</b> another 200families left homeless after their houses were destroyed. The combination of winds and rain destroyed thousands of flimsy houses across the region. The rainfall also destroyed large areas of crops, and also killed many livestock. The rainfall caused the Iguagil dam in Comondú to overflow, isolating 15towns due to 4feet (1.5m) floodwaters. In the coastal city of Mulegé, flash flooding caused widespread damage throughout the town and the death of a United States citizen. More than 250homes were damaged or destroyed in the town, leaving many people homeless. Severe flooding blocked portions of Federal Highway 1, and damaged an aqueduct in the region.|$|E
