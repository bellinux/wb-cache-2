2500|$|Another {{issue in}} the debate is the fact neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short ever faced court martial. It is alleged this was to avoid {{disclosing}} information showing the U.S. had advanced knowledge of the attack. When asked, [...] "Will historians know more later?", Kimmel replied, [...] "' ... I'll tell you what I believe. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the incriminating records have been destroyed. ... I doubt if the truth will ever emerge.' ..."

60|$|Of how I descended that ladder I have no recollection, nor do I in {{the least}} know how the Mountaineers came after me, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the <b>most</b> of them rolled and {{scrambled}} down the thirty feet of rock. At least, to their honour be it said, they did come, yelling like demons and waving long knives in their hands.|$|R
60|$|And now {{in these}} black pits {{of the other}} Warhoons I looked into those same fiery eyes, blazing at me through the terrible darkness, {{revealing}} {{no sign of the}} beast behind them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the <b>most</b> fearsome attribute of these awesome creatures is their silence and the fact that one never sees them--nothing but those baleful eyes glaring unblinkingly out of the dark void behind.|$|R
5000|$|In Simpkins v Pays 1955, an {{informal}} agreement between a grandmother, granddaughter and a lodger to share competition winnings was binding. Sellers J held, applying the objective test, that the facts showed a [...] "mutuality" [...] between the parties, adding:If my conclusion {{that there was}} an arrangement to share any prize money is not correct, the alternative position to that of these three persons competing together as a [...] "syndicate", as counsel for the plaintiff put it, would mean that the plaintiff, despite her propensity for having a gamble, suddenly abandoned all her interest in the competition in the Sunday Empire News. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is <b>most</b> improbable ...|$|R

60|$|Indeed {{it looked}} {{extremely}} like Christian as Benham went {{up across the}} springy turf from Epsom Downs station towards {{the crest of the}} hill. Was he not also fleeing in the morning sunlight from the City of Destruction? Was he not also seeking that better city whose name is Peace? And there was a bundle on his back. It was the bundle, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> seized <b>most</b> firmly upon the too literary imagination of White.|$|R
50|$|The {{principles}} behind o•blék {{are that}} we try to present work as faithfully as possible according to typescript. The second principle is {{that we try}} to exclusively accept work only on the basis of our own taste. I find I’ve seen in the past a lot of publications that operate {{in terms of trying to}} represent something or do something specific and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that’s</b> fine but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the <b>most</b> powerful things I’ve seen are things that admit personal taste as the only basis to make that decision on.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Tioga County, Thomas {{wrote of}} his {{childhood}} in Nichols, New York, [...] "I was surrounded by older relatives since the day I was born and thought of my grandmother's house as an extension, {{for a lack of}} a better word, of my own. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the <b>most</b> important thing I learned was that older relatives were valuable and esteemed members of the extended family. In fact, they were the glue that held the family together." ...|$|R

There must be a very strong body out altogether, and {{probably}} they have resolved upon vengeance for their last year's defeat. They had better have left it alone, for they have no more chance of taking this house, with us all upon our guard, than they have of flying. There is one advantage in it,--they will get such a lesson, that I do think we shall be perfectly free from Indian attacks for the future.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} like to say {{less than three months}} at the earliest; it will require some time to collect as fine a set of {{emeralds}} as these. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> probably I shall use these emeralds, or the greater part of them, and collect others to take their places at my leisure. I do not know whether the best plan would not be to take the diamonds out and substitute pearls; there would be no difficulty in getting them, and in that case I might have it ready for you in a month." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so, Master Leigh," [...] Rouget said. [...] "It {{might be}} managed in that way. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of our chaps {{had better be}} told off for firing the town. I think that a good many {{might be willing to}} {{undertake}} that job, for I have heard it said, many and many a time, {{that they would like to}} burn the sewer rats out. There are other men who would, I am sure, rather join in the attack on the jail, if they could do so without putting the lives of all of us in danger.|$|E
40|$|Today,the {{system of}} the market economy is in a {{historical}} corner. A certain kind of limit of the market economy was exposed after the Lehman Shock in 2008. The market economy has not carried out self-collapse {{but it would be}} facing a system crisis. In this short paper(IV), I would like to explore the new trend of economics and economic system. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the <b>most</b> impotant thing now is setting the forth the directivity of new economics and economic system...|$|R
40|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the <b>most</b> {{important}} {{characteristic of}} deliberative democracy is reasongiving requirement. The reasons {{should be given}} and accepted among free and equal citizens. Naturally, modern democracies are mostly representative democracies and do not require that citizens make all political decisions by themselves. Citizens depend on their representatives, but representatives are expected not only to deliberate among themselves but also to communicate with citizens. I hope that the deliberation between citizens and their representatives changes citizen's private interests into general interests...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the <b>most</b> fun <b>I</b> had {{programming}} was {{a summer}} job at Project MAC at MIT {{in the summer of}} 1966, where I worked on a program that created a job tape for the brand new GE 645 in the earliest days of Multics. I was writing in MAD, which was much easier and more pleasant than the FORTRAN and COBOL that I had written earlier, and I was using CTSS, the first time-sharing system, which was infinitely easier and more pleasant than punch cards.|$|R
6000|$|... "So thought {{some of us}} at first," [...] {{returned}} Dan, [...] "but when {{we found}} that the thermometer fell to somewhere between 40 and 50 degrees below zero; that walking in snow-shoes, trapping, hunting buffalo, and shooting, were not to be learned in a few days; and when we saw our women and children dependent sometimes on the charity of Indians, and reduced almost to starvation, we changed our minds as to the pleasure of the thing. However, if the school was rough, it made the scholars all the quicker, and now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of us are equal to the Redskins themselves at their own work.|$|E
60|$|This may be fancy, though I {{think the}} memory of {{most of us can}} go farther back into such times than many of us suppose; just as I believe the power of {{observation}} in numbers of very young children to be quite wonderful for its closeness and accuracy. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> grown men who are remarkable in this respect, may with greater propriety be said not to have lost the faculty, than to have acquired it; the rather, as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness, and gentleness, and capacity of being pleased, which are also an inheritance they have preserved from their childhood.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Sisters,--Think of {{my being}} ashore, and in a Christian land on this day. So it is. We sail (D.V.) in six days, {{as it may be}} this day week. The Melanesians are very good and pretty well in health, but we are all anxious to be in warm climates. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> matters are settled. Primate and I have {{finished}} our accounts. Think of his wise stewardship! The endowment in land and money, and no debts contracted! I hope that I leave nothing behind me to cause difficulty, should anything happen. The Primate and Sir William Martin are my executors; Melanesia, as you would expect, my heir. I may have forgotten many items, personal reminiscences. Ask for anything, should anything happen. I see no reason to anticipate it, humanly speaking, but it is always well to think of such things. I am just going to the little Taurarua chapel to our Melanesian Commemoration service with Holy Communion.|$|E
2500|$|The storyline {{received}} positive {{attention from}} critics. Dianne Butler, {{writing for the}} Herald Sun, quipped [...] "the bride and groom give {{a bit of a}} shudder when Paul Robinson arrives at their door {{on the morning of the}} wedding, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>most</b> people's reaction any time Paul shows up. But it's a lovely day – yellow roses, Karl doesn't sing – apart from the robbery, and the screaming and the ambulances. Neighbours eh? Brilliant. Nobody's done a wedding like this in years." [...] Kate Lucey from Sugar called [...] "Neighbours: The Explosion" [...] one of the serial's [...] "biggest storylines of the year" [...] and included it in her feature on upcoming dramatic soap storylines. Lucey said [...] "With an upcoming fire in the Rovers Return for Coronation Street, an explosion in Neighbours and the newly announced plans for a pregnancy in EastEnders, we're not really sure where to look first." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy stated that the explosion was [...] "one of 2013's biggest storylines." [...] Of the explosion, a columnist from New! commented [...] "This is one episode you DO NOT want to miss!" ...|$|R

50|$|Of the results, Anastassiou said:These {{signatures}} {{manifest themselves}} in specific genes that are turned on {{together in the}} tissues of some patients in many different cancer types... If these general cancer signatures are useful in breast cancer, as we proved in this challenge, then why not in other types of cancer as well? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the <b>most</b> significant -- and exciting -- implication of our work is the hope that these signatures {{can be used for}} improved diagnostic, prognostic, and eventually, therapeutic products, applicable to multiple cancers.|$|R

As you see, I had a narrow escape; for had that dart that went through my ear been {{an inch or two}} to the right it would have pierced my eye. I have two or three nasty gashes with their swords on the legs, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the other men came out worse than I did. It was lucky that they did not strike at the horses; but I suppose they wanted them, and so avoided inflicting injury on them. However, it has been a tough fight, and we are well out of it. I hope I shall not be called on to use my battle-ax again until I am {{fighting}} in the ranks of the Rebu." ...|$|E
60|$|I am sure I {{should have}} liked to {{know a great deal}} more about this {{struggle}} for the empire of the world, and as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of you would also like to do so, I have chosen this subject for my story. Fortunately there is no lack of authentic material from which to glean the incidents of the struggle. Polybius visited all the passes of the Alps some forty years after the event, and conversed with tribesmen who had witnessed the passage of Hannibal, and {{there can be no doubt}} that his descriptions are far more accurate than those of Livy, who wrote somewhat later and had no personal knowledge of the affair. Numbers of books have been written as to the identity of the passes traversed by Hannibal. The whole of these have been discussed and summarized by Mr. W. J. Law, and as it appears to me that his arguments are quite conclusive I have adopted the line which he lays down as that followed by Hannibal.|$|E
60|$|From Washington I journeyed back to Boston {{through the}} cities which I had visited in coming thither, and stayed again on my route, {{for a few}} days, at Baltimore, at Philadelphia, and at New York. At each town there were those whom I now {{regarded}} almost as old friends, and {{as the time of}} my departure drew near I felt a sorrow that I was not to be allowed to stay longer. As the general result of my sojourn in the country, I must declare that I was always happy and comfortable in the Eastern cities, and generally unhappy and uncomfortable in the West. I had previously been inclined to think that I should like the roughness of the West, and that in the East I should encounter an arrogance which would have kept me always on the verge of hot water; but in both these surmises I found myself to have been wrong. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> English travelers would come to the same conclusion. The Western people do not mean to be harsh or uncivil, but they do not make themselves pleasant. In all the Eastern cities--I speak of the Eastern cities north of Washington--a society may be found which must be esteemed as agreeable by Englishmen who like clever, genial men, and who love clever, pretty women.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Amphiaraos <b>most</b> of all {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} interpreting dreams: {{it is clear}} that, when he was considered a god, he set up an oracle of dreams. And {{the first thing is}} to purify oneself, when someone comes to consult Amphiaraos, and the purification ritual is to sacrifice to the god, and people sacrifice to him and to all those whose names are on (the altar), and - when these things are finished – they sacrifice a ram and spread out its skin under themselves, lie down waiting for the revelation of a dream.|$|R
