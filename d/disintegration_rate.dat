50|$|The {{processes}} used {{to manufacture}} orally disintegrating tablets include loose compression tabletting, {{a process which}} is not very different than the manufacturing method used for traditional tablets and lyophilization processes. In loose compression, ODTs are compressed at much lower forces (4 - 20 kN) than traditional tablets. However, since ODTs are compressed at very low forces due {{to the need to}} them to be soft enough to disintegrate rapidly in the mouth, issues of material sticking to the die walls can be challenging. Typically, as in most tablet blends, lubricants such as magnesium stearate are added to the blend {{to reduce the amount of}} material that may stick to the die wall. Differences may be the use of disintegrating aids, such as crospovidone, and binding agents that aid in mouth feel, such as microcrystalline cellulose. Primarily, ODTs contain some form of sugar such as mannitol, which typically serves as the major diluent of the ODTs, and is also the primary contributor to the smooth and creamy mouth feel of most ODTs. Lyophilized ODT formulations may use proprietary technologies but can produce a tablet that has a faster <b>disintegration</b> <b>rate,</b> for example the Zydis ODT typically dissolves in the mouth in less than 5 seconds without water. ODTs are available in HPDE bottles (Parcopa) or individually sealed in blister packs to protect the tablets from damage, moisture, and oxidation. Because ODTs are soft in nature, the ability to successfully package an ODT in a bottle is difficult. However, CIMA Labs markets their Durasolv ODT as being able to be placed into bottle for commercial sale, while CIMA's Orasolv is marketed for blisters only. Zydis ODT tablets manufactured by Catalent Pharma Solutions are delivered in a blister pack. The differences between the two CIMA products are proprietary, however, the primary difference is expected to be the use of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), such as Avicel PH101, in the Durasolv product. MCC serves multiple purposes in an ODT but in the case of CIMA's products, it acts as a binder, increasing the internal strength of the tablet and making it more robust for packaging in bottles.|$|E

We use our limiting model to show that a previously proposed infinite-rate model is formulated incorrectly. Our principle aim is to investigate how the <b>disintegration</b> <b>rate</b> in the sludge disintegration unit affects the formation of sludge in the reactor. In the limiting case of an infinite <b>disintegration</b> <b>rate,</b> we show that there is a critical value for the sludge disintegration factor, above which the reactor system is guaranteed to be in a state of negative excess sludge production.

40|$|In view of {{enhancing}} {{the efficiency of}} the anaerobic digestion process performed on waste activated sludge (WAS) produced in a WWTPs, several pretreatments were performed using mechanical and thermal systems. Samples of WAS were prepared at different total solids (TS) content, between 2 % and 9 % w/w, with the focus of investigating the influence of this parameter on the performance of the chosen pretreatment. The evaluation of the <b>disintegration</b> <b>rate</b> (DR), referred to the COD solubilization due to the pretreatment, permitted to compare the results obtained even though coming from different lysis systems and working conditions. The mechanical pretreatment, performed with a high shear mixer, permitted to obtain a COD <b>disintegration</b> <b>rate</b> dependent on the TS content of the WAS with a maximum DR equal to 1, 7 %. Thermal pretreatments were performed with a thermostatic bath (343 K), an oven (343 K) and an autoclave (393 K at 1. 2 atm overpressure) : no influence of TS content was observed, while the choice of the lysis system and the time of treatment played a fundamental role towards COD solubilization. The higher DR values obtained were between 14 % and 28 % making thermal pretreatments more suitable for the subsequent WAS anaerobic digestion optimization.

40|$|In {{order to}} quantitate {{lymphocyte}} proliferative responses, we explored {{the role of}} cell death in the kinetics of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated cultures. Unless the disintegration time (tDIS) of nonviable lymphocytes in culture is known, the rate of cell death cannot be calculated. To obtain tDIS, we determined the time interval between total and viable cell population decay after various killing events. Two subpopulations of lymphocytes were observed, the major (80 %) with a mean (+/-SEM) tDIS of 16 +/- 2 hr and the minor (20 %) with a tDIS of 45 +/- 7 hr. Kinetic balance sheets were constructed predicting total culture DNA content (cells plus medium), as calculated both from proliferation rates and from observed death and <b>disintegration</b> <b>rates.</b> In an experiment characterized by extensive cell death, the two tallies were well-matched when the above data were utilized. The large discrepancy between predicted and observed DNA contents of the medium indicates that the DNA of disintegrated lymphocytes is extensively degraded.

Our approach to quantitation of cell death may have general applicability to kinetic studies of cultured cells...|$|R
40|$|This thesis project studied {{microcrystalline}} cellulose II (CII), a polymorphic form of cellulose, which has lower mechanical properties, less plastic deformation, higher elastic recovery and faster disintegration properties than {{microcrystalline cellulose}} I (CI). Also, {{the effects of}} processing and silicification on CII materials were investigated. Particle modification through spray drying, wet granulation and spheronization was employed to improve CII performance. Spray-drying (SDCII) and wet granulation (WGCII) produced materials with no difference in mechanical or disintegration properties from unprocessed CII, but did show an increase in density and particle flow. Conversely, spheronization (SPCII) showed the poorest mechanical properties compared to CII. Further, SDCII showed better dilution potential than CII. Thus the advantages of SDCII were apparent when it was mixed with a poorly compressible drug (acetaminophen) because fibrous CII was converted to spheroidal particles through spray drying. The rapid disintegration of SDCII and CII compacts was due to water wicking through capillaries followed by compact bursting.

40|$|It {{has long}} been the hope of {{investigators}} using liquid scintillation counters to be able to determine the disinte-gration rate of a radionuclide in a sample directly, without having to use a standard solution of the radionuclide to calibrate the counting system. In this paper, a method will be described which enables the investigator to determine the <b>disintegration</b> <b>rate</b> of a beta emitting radionuclide in a sample by measuring the pulse height shift produced by quench-ing (either real or simulated). This paper also describes two new liquid scintillation counters, Beckman LS- 8000 and Beckman LS- 9000, which provide the capability for determina-tion of disintegration rates by this method. Three previous reports 3 have dealt with the application of a double extrapolation method based upon the measurement of the amount of successive increases in quench by the Compton edge-half-height method. The first two reports dealt with quench produced by the addition of a quenching agent directly into the sample-liquid scintillation solution. The last report dealt with a method of simulated quench by introduction of an optical filter between the sample and the detector (multiplier phototube). All three of the reports utilized a single multiplier phototube (MPT) detection system; i. e., a non-coincidence system. Because of the high background which results from use of the single MPT, it was necessary to count the sample at various threshold levels and extrapolate to a zero threshold in order to obtain the sample count rate at each quench level. The logarithm of the extrapolated count rate is then plotted {{as a function of the}} relative pulse height for the half-height of the Compton edge.

40|$|In Part 1 of {{the thesis}} the {{disintegration}} of lead cathodes in aqueous perchloric and sulphuric acids at room temperature is considered. Electrochemical methods of analysis (differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry and differential pulse polarography) of the Pb²⁺ concentrations generated by lead disintegration has enabled it to be detected at lower rates and hence at lower current densities than hitherto. Periodic sampling has enabled observations to continue during several hours of cathodisation. [...] Lead <b>disintegration</b> <b>rates</b> in aqueous H₂SO₄ {{were found to be}} 10 - 25 times those observed by Gastwirt and Salzberg in 1957, probably because of the exclusion of air, other precautions against impurities and because of the use of more sensitive techniques for measuring <b>disintegration.</b> <b>Disintegration</b> <b>rates</b> in aqueous HC 10 ₄ are comparable to those in H₂SO₄, in both cases decreasing with increase in [H₃O⁺] because of the inhibiting effects of hydronium ions on disintegration. [...] As found by Gastwirt and Salzberg, threshold current densities also increase with [H₃O⁺], continuous disintegration being unobservable at lower current densities. Nevertheless, disintegration of a different type does occur below threshold current densities, in this case being a discontinuous process. This previously unknown phenomenon is attributed to accumulation of atomic hydrogen in the lead, combining within the lattice to H₂ and exerting such pressures that particles of lead are ejected. [...] Cathodic disintegration of lead is thought to involve chemical and mechanical processes simultaneously. The chemical process is proposed to be formation and decomposition of surface PbHx where x ≤ 2, while the mechanical process involves bulk diffusion of H atoms and their subsequent combination to H₂ resulting in Pb ejection. [...] In Part 2 of the thesis, studies of the diffusion of electro-lytically generated hydrogen through silver are described, together with the results of overvoltage and capacitance measurements at silver cathodes in aqueous perchloric acid at room temperature. Capacitances were deduced from open-circuit potential decay measurements. The increase of overvoltage and the growth of the measured capacitances in the course of electrolysis are attributed to a growing pseudocapacitance component. This is analysed in terms of an increasing coverage, ⊖H, of the cathode by adsorbed hydrogen atoms. The increase in surface coverage from the beginning up to several days of cathodisation ranged up to 2 % of a monolayer for silver in 0. 1 mol ℓ⁻¹ HC 10 ₄ and up to 0. 9 % of a monolayer in 1 mol ℓ⁻¹ HC 10 ₄. [...] The increase of overvoltage at constant current density and the increase of electrode capacitance at constant overvoltage with the logarithm of the cathodic charge (-Q) were both linear up to Q values of about - 60 C cm⁻². This increase of overvoltage and pseudo-capacitance might be attributed to the adsorption and absorption of hydrogen atoms by silver cathodes...|$|R
