KuhnDuring the {{development}} of an educational renewable energy production platform, it was found that there were no low-cost, efficient grid-tie interfaces for a 160 W DC wind turbine. Typically, a small DC wind turbine is used in conjunction with a rechargeable battery bank or, if the wind turbine is directly interfaced with a grid-tie inverter, a regulator with a diversion-load. The use of batteries is undesirable due to their high-cost and high-maintenance characteristics. Diversion loads by nature waste power, as any excess energy that cannot be accepted by a battery or inverter is usually converted into heat through a resistive element. Initially, a 24 V DC, 160 W Air Breeze small wind turbine was directly connected to an Enphase Energy M 190 grid-tie micro-inverter. The 24 V DC Air Breeze wind turbine is designed to charge a battery or bank of batteries while the M 190 micro-inverter is designed to convert the DC output of a 200 W solar panel to grid-tied AC power. As expected, the power-production response time associated with the small wind turbine and the power-accepting, load-matching response time of the micro-inverter were not compatible. The rapidly changing power output of the small wind turbine conflicted with the slow response time of the micro-inverter resulting in little power production. Ultimately, the response time mismatch also produced sufficiently large voltage spikes to damage the turbine electronics. In this thesis, a solution for a low-cost, efficient grid-tie interface using no batteries and no <b>diversion</b> <b>load</b> is presented. A capacitance of eight Farads is placed in parallel with the small wind turbine and the micro inverter. The large capacitance sufficiently smoothes the potential abrupt voltage changes produced by the wind turbine, allowing the micro-inverter adequate time to adjust its load for optimal power conversion. Laboratory experiments and data from an implementation of such a parallel super capacitor wind turbine to grid-tie micro-inverter configuration are provided along with DC and AC power production monitoring circuits interfaced with a micro controller...|$|E

40|$|The current {{reference}} concept, i. e. the semihydrostatic emplacement model, for {{the final}} disposal of heat-generating high- and intermediate-level waste in deep vertical boreholes in salt provides for completely embedding each individual package in crushed salt. <b>Load</b> <b>diversion</b> by embedding in crushed salt (LEISA = Lastabtragung durch EInbettung in SAlzgrus) will limit the stacking loads to the packages embedded. On behalf of the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS - Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz), {{which is responsible for}} establishing the Gorleben planning, the Research Centre Jülich is engaged in studying theoretically as well as experimentally the applicability of this concept to a future repository (ILW(Q) und HTGR fuel element experimental programme). Two test stands with different geometrical dimensions were designed, manufactured, instrumented and put into operation for simulating a repository borehole. The pressure distributions were measured in the test stands and compared with those calculated, varying all decisive parameters. According to the measurements performed in this test programme, the predictions of the semihydrostatic model for a rough borehole wall surface examined in both test stands are in very good agreement with the experiments. The deviations between theory and experiment found for a smooth wall surface are presumably due to a still too unspecific determination of those crushed-salt parameters which are incorporated in the model calculations. The investigations carried out to date may be summarized as follows: <b>load</b> <b>diversion</b> by embedding in crushed salt is a highly efficient tool for limiting the stacking loads in vertical repository boreholes filled with crushed salt and waste packages...|$|R

One of the most current existing works developed a state balancing system based on probability distribution of peer abilities, loads of virtual servers, and incomplete data of global peers. On the other hand state balancing method recognizing peer node capacities are difficult a) as the demand and weight of the peer differ time to time which requires to be addressed b) In account of this, the peer node persistence needs to be managed with its CPU cycles for processing the client demands c) <b>Load</b> <b>diversion</b> of peer neighbors supply {{to the difficulty of}} corresponding peer nodes on serving their vital demand d) At the lower dimension of load balancing, various data forma...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of earlier studies for the MHV project (ILW(Q) and HTGR fuel element experimental programme) FEUSER and BLOCK developed theoretical model approaches to determine the <b>load</b> <b>diversion</b> in emplacing waste packages in underground boreholes filled with crushed salt. The pressure distribution over the borehole depth {{in the case of}} completely embedding the waste packages is influenced by the mechanical properties of the bulk crushed salt. For validating the model approaches, therefore, the angle of internal friction, the bed density and the angle of wall friction of a representative crushed salt sample from the Na 2 material were measured with a large shearing device of the Jenike type. Variations of the crushed salt parameters comprised the upper grain size of x$_{o}$ = 20 mm and x$_{o}$ = 10 mm, the fine material fraction in seven graduations as well as the temperature of t = 60 °C, 100 °C and 150 °C. The influence of possible variations of the chemiealmineralogical composition of the crushed salt was assessed by examining a sample of the Na 3 material with x < 20 mm. The wall materials (CFRP, V 4 A steel, rock salt block) and their surface roughness were additionally varied in wall friction experiments. It was found that the fine grain fraction particularly affects the bed density {{and to a lesser extent}} the angle of friction. Wall friction is perceptibly influenced by roughness and in part by temperature. The upper grain size and the chemical-mineralogical composition show a relative moderate influence on the properties...|$|R
