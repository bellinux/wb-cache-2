50|$|As {{mentioned}} in recital No. 1 of the Regulation {{a number of}} substantial changes are {{to be made to}} Council Regulation (EC) No. 1777/2005 of 17 October 2005 laying down implementing measures for Directive 77/388/EEC on the common system of value added tax. It is desirable, for reasons of clarity and rationalization, that the provisions in question should be recast.One of the main reasons for the need of amendment, referring to recital No. 3 of the Regulation, is the transpose of changes resulting from the adoption of Council Directive 2008/8/EC of 12 February 2008 amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services. Additionally the adoption of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 520/2009 - covering changes to the place of supply and service - requires the mentioned modification.The objective is to ensure uniform application of the current VAT system by laying down rules <b>implementing</b> <b>Directive</b> 2006/112/EC, in particular in respect of taxable persons, the supply of goods and services, and the place of taxable transactions (cf. recital No. 4 Reg.).|$|E
