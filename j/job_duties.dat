25|$|In 1975, Pearce was {{unseated}} in {{the nonpartisan}} blanket primary by Gil Dozier of Baton Rouge.

Allegations of bribery, perjury, and extortion in connection with his <b>job</b> <b>duties</b> worked to sink Pearce's career.

25|$|An {{important}} logical {{control that}} is frequently overlooked {{is the principle}} of least privilege. The principle of least privilege requires that an individual, program or system process is not granted any more access privileges than are necessary to perform the task. A blatant example of the failure {{to adhere to the}} principle of least privilege is logging into Windows as user Administrator to read email and surf the web. Violations of this principle can also occur when an individual collects additional access privileges over time. This happens when employees' <b>job</b> <b>duties</b> change, or they are promoted to a new position, or they transfer to another department. The access privileges required by their new duties are frequently added onto their already existing access privileges which may no longer be necessary or appropriate.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed {{to clarify the}} {{psychological}} effects of the patients' suicide on nurses and the mental care they received actually and wished. The patients' suicide affected their mental, life, and job performance. Then, they attempted to cope with their own stress to concentrate on their hobby, to stay with someone, or {{to talk to the}} close co-workers. Some of them had on-the-job supports such as conferences in their ward, an individual interview by their head nurse, or a temporal reduction of their <b>job</b> <b>duty.</b> Others had off-the-job supports by listening to their experience or feeling. On-the-job supports they wished were a ward conference with the improvement or a temporal reduction of their <b>job</b> <b>duty.</b> Also, the interventions by the professionals of mental care or embalming were requested. Some of them hoped to have the study and training, especially about the impacts to their own. These results suggest that nurses don't have enough support by their organization, though they tend to be influenced by the patients' suicide. It is important to utilize the knowledge for the supervision of clinical psychology to hold their conference. To prepare the good relationship is necessary to share the experience effectively in the ward...|$|R

2500|$|Chorale preludes {{constitute}} {{almost half}} of Pachelbel's surviving organ works, {{in part because of}} his Erfurt <b>job</b> <b>duties</b> which required him to compose chorale preludes on a regular basis. The models Pachelbel used most frequently are the three-part cantus firmus setting, the chorale fugue and, most importantly, a model he invented which combined the two types. This latter type begins with a brief chorale fugue that is followed by a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting. Chorale phrases are treated one at a time, in the order in which they occur; frequently, the accompanying voices anticipate the next phrase by using bits of the melody in imitative counterpoint.

[...] "Restricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee's professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen," [...] Kennedy wrote. [...] "It simply reflects the exercise of employer control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created". He cited language from his majority opinion in Rosenberger v.

2500|$|Also {{referred}} to as contextual behavior, prosocial behavior, and extra-role behavior, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) consists of employee behavior {{that contributes to the}} welfare of the organization but {{is beyond the scope of}} the employee’s <b>job</b> <b>duties.</b> [...] These extra-role behaviors may help or hinder the attainment of organizational goals. [...] Research supports five dimensions of OCB: altruism, conscientiousness, courtesy, sportsmanship, and civic virtue. [...] Researchers have found that the OCB dimensions of altruism and civic virtue can have just as much of an impact on manager’s subjective evaluations of employees’ performances as employees’ objective productivity levels. [...] The degree to which OCB can influence judgments of job performance is relatively high. [...] Controversy exists as to whether OCB should be formally considered as a part of performance appraisal (PA).|$|E

30|$|Another {{practical}} {{implication is}} that there is industrial difference in expectations of helping, particularly those of altruism. Participants from the bank tend to show higher levels of altruism expectations than those from the manufacturing, B = . 136 (SE = . 067), t(919) =  2.191, p <  05, η 2  = . 006. Usually the service transactions take place face-to-face in interactions between service agents and customers. Employees in service organizations may go beyond their <b>job</b> <b>duty</b> in order to meet their customers. In particular, service industries that require high levels of service quality are more likely to show higher expectations of coworkers’ helping. This implies that service organizations may need to remove such implicit pressures of helping behaviors which can result in job-related stress or role-overload.|$|R
2500|$|Justice Stevens filed a brief dissent. Though {{he agreed}} with the majority’s {{determination}} that a supervisor may take corrective action against [...] "inflammatory or misguided" [...] speech, he questioned whether the same logic applies against [...] "unwelcome speech" [...] that [...] "reveals facts that the supervisor would rather not have anyone else discover." [...] Citing Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District (1979), Justice Stevens emphatically disagreed {{with the notion that}} there was a categorical difference between speech uttered by a citizen or by an employee {{in the course of his}} duties. In Givhan, ruling on the issue of an English teacher voicing concerns to the principal about the school’s racist employment practices, the Court did not evaluate whether these concerns were raised in accordance with her <b>job</b> <b>duties.</b> Consequently, “our silence ...demonstrates that the point was immaterial.” Stevens added that it would be senseless for the constitutional protection of same words to be contingent on whether they are uttered as part of one’s job duties; additionally, it would be “perverse” for the Court to essentially create an incentive for employees to bypass their employer-specified channels of resolution and voice their concerns directly to the public.|$|E

In other types of work, such as firefighting or live-in caregiving, sleeping {{at least part of}} the shift may be a part of the paid work time. While some employees who sleep while on duty in violation do so intentionally and hope not to get caught, others intend in good faith to stay awake, and accidentally doze.|$|R

As a result, in October 1894 her salary was cut. Guiney’s friends subsequently led a counterattack that resulted in stamp purchases coming to Auburndale from Roman Catholics nationwide. Despite her reappointment to the postmaster position in 1897, Guiney’s ill health and dislike for the long hours of the job led to her resignation on 5 July 1897.
