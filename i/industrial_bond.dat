Its mission is [...] "to attract, retain, and grow businesses and {{jobs for the}} regions of Los Angeles County." [...] The LAEDC was originally formed to facilitate Los Angeles County's <b>industrial</b> <b>bond</b> development program through land development, project financing and marketing activities. Since that time, the organization has grown to encompass {{a wide range of}} services, using a broad-based coalition of chambers of commerce, trade organizations, business associations, and government officials. In particular, the LAEDC's conferences, economic forecasts and other professional events, held throughout the year in various locations throughout the Los Angeles County region, provide the business community with a place to interact with each other and individuals from the local schools, government and other constituencies.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, {{the firm}} made {{headlines}} when its managing partner, Harold L. Stuart, {{testified before the}} U.S. Supreme Court for the government's antitrust case against Morgan Stanley and 16 other major investment banks. The fact that Halsey, Stuart was a significant Wall Street player (responsible for the most IPOs in 1951) led some observers to suspect that they had provoked the government's antitrust suit. This claim that Halsey was a major IPO player is factually incorrect, Halsey Stuart {{was not involved in}} significant equity trades or IPO's. It may have owned a seat on a regional stock exchange, as a matter of prestige, but was {{not a member of the}} NYSE and had no equity trading operations. This firm was a fixed income underwriter and trader, municipal bonds, railroad equipment trusts certificates and utility bonds. The hearings in question came about because Halsey was excluded from <b>industrial</b> <b>bond</b> underwriting by the 16 noted above in retaliation for the firm's helping to foster legislation causing public utilities to sell their bond offering at public auction - industrial underwriting were negotiated sales involving the big 16 but not Halsey. There is a book by Forrest McDonald - The Phaeton Ride; the Crisis of American Success, published in the 1960s, which speaks to the connections among the Insull Affair, Halsey Stuart and these hearings.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the usefulness of statistical decomposition measures in the prediction of <b>industrial</b> <b>bond</b> rating changes. Further, the predictive ability of decomposition measures is compared with multiple discriminant analysis on the same sample. The problem of this study is twofold. It stems in general from the statistical problems associated with current techniques employed in the study of bond ratings and in particular from the lack of attention to the study of bond rating changes. Two main hypotheses are tested in this study. The first is that bond rating changes can be predicted through the use of financial statement data. The second is that decomposition analysis can achieve the same performance as multiple discriminant analysis in duplicating and predicting <b>industrial</b> <b>bond</b> rating changes. To explain and predict <b>industrial</b> <b>bond</b> rating changes, statistical decomposition measures were computed for each company in the sample. Based on these decomposition measures, the two types of analyses performed were (a) a univariate analysis where each decomposition measure was compared with an industry average decomposition measure, and (b) a multivariate analysis where decomposition measures were used as independent variables in a probability linear model. In addition to statistical decomposition analysis, multiple discriminant analysis was used in duplicating and predicting bond rating changes. Finally, a comparison was made between the predictive abilities of decomposition analysis and discriminant analysis...|$|E

In this research, the fiberboards were prepared from four different treatments which are untreated, UF-resin treated, microwave heating treated and laccase treated 6 U/g fiber boards. Hot pressing at constant 200 °C and 4 minutes pressing was done to form the boards. For each treatment the boards were tested for modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR) and internal bond strength (IB). From the results obtained, the microwave heating treated boards displayed quite comparable in average mechanical property within the UF-resin treated (standard) boards meanwhile for laccase treatment of fibers, it displayed the lowest MOR and MOE values. As a conclusion, the microwave heating treatment shows promise and possibilities for <b>industrial</b> <b>bonding</b> and modification of lignin content in wood fiber.
