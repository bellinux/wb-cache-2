25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

500|$|One night, Dussander {{tries to}} kill a hobo who earlier had seen him in the uniform. When Dussander has a heart attack, he calls Todd, who {{finishes}} the job, cleans up, and calls an ambulance for Dussander. At the hospital, Dussander is recognized by a death camp survivor sharing his room and he is arrested, prior to being extradited to Israel. Todd graduates as his school's valedictorian and gives a speech about Icarus, saying, [...] "All great achievements arose from dissatisfaction. It is the desire to <b>do</b> <b>better,</b> <b>to</b> dig deeper, that propels civilization to greatness." [...] The scene is juxtaposed in a montage with Dussander's home being searched and the hobo's corpse being found in the basement.|$|E
5000|$|This paralytic d’Anthés, this uncle Monia {{from the}} Basseinaia Street [...] [...] [...] Uncle Gornfel'd, {{why did you}} decide to {{complain}} in the Birzhevka, that is, The Red Evening Gazette, in the Soviet year of 1929? You would have <b>done</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> weep in the clean Jewish literary waistcoat of Mr. Propper. You would have <b>done</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> relate your misfortune to the banker with sciatic nerve, kugel, and the tallith.|$|R

500|$|Taylor Swift {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} contemporary critics. Jeff Tamarkin of AllMusic described Swift as [...] "a fresh, still girlish voice, {{full of hope}} and naïveté, but it's also a confident and mature one". He said her [...] "talent to be reckoned" [...] was portrayed through the songs [...] "Tim McGraw", [...] "The Outside", and [...] "Mary's Song (Oh My My My)". Tamarkin criticized producer Nathan Chapman for applying [...] "a gloss that not all [...] really require {{and in some cases}} would <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> shed". Rick Bell of Country Standard Time gave a positive review, saying that Swift had [...] "smart songwriting" [...] and that [...] "her deeply personal, self-penned songs, particularly 'The Outside' and 'Our Song'" [...] were [...] "stirring." [...] He compared her sound to Cyndi Thomson and Hilary Duff. Chris Neal of Country Weekly said that Swift [...] "demonstrat an honesty, intelligence and idealism with which listeners of any age will be able to connect" [...] and added that [...] "the more thoughtful material suggests a talent poised to last well past high school." [...] Ken Rosenbaum of The Toledo Blade wrote Swift [...] "deftly handles lyrics and subjects in that shadowy area between teenager and womanhood." ...|$|E

2500|$|U.S. Representative Fred Upton, {{who is a}} St. Joseph native, {{released}} a statement saying, [...] "What occurred today in my hometown breaks my heart. My thoughts are with our entire community — our friends and neighbors. One thing is clear: we must <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> prevent these types of tragedies from occurring." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perrow {{concluded}} that the failure at Three Mile Island was {{a consequence of the}} system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'. Therefore, he suggested, we might <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> contemplate a radical redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely.|$|E
2500|$|William Baumol {{provided}} in his 1977 paper the current formal {{definition of a}} natural monopoly where “an industry in which multiform production is more costly than production by a monopoly”. Baumol defined a contestable market in his 1982 paper as a market where [...] "entry is absolutely free and exit absolutely costless", freedom of entry in Stigler sense: the incumbent has no cost discrimination against entrants. He states that a contestable market will never have an economic profit greater than zero when in equilibrium and the equilibrium will also be efficient. According to Baumol this equilibrium emerges endogenously {{due to the nature}} of contestable markets, that is the only industry structure that survives in the long run is the one which minimizes total costs. This is in contrast to the older theory of industry structure since not only industry structure is not exogenously given, but equilibrium is reached without add hoc hypothesis on the behavior of firms, say using reaction functions in a duopoly. He concludes the paper commenting that regulators that seek to impede entry and/or exit of firms would <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> not interfere if the market in question resembles a contestable market.|$|E
2500|$|Juan Diego, as {{a devout}} neophyte, {{was in the}} habit of {{regularly}} walking from his home to the Franciscan mission station at Tlatelolco for religious instruction and to perform his religious duties. His route passed by the hill at Tepeyac. First apparition: at dawn on Saturday December 9, 1531 while on his usual journey, he encountered the Virgin Mary who revealed herself as the ever-virgin Mother of God and instructed him to request the bishop to erect a chapel in her honour so that she might relieve the distress of all those who call on her in their need. He delivered the request, but was told by the bishop (Fray Juan Zumárraga) to come back another day after he had had time to reflect upon what Juan Diego had told him. Second apparition, later the same day: returning to Tepeyac, Juan Diego encountered the Virgin again and announced the failure of his mission, suggesting that because he was [...] "a back-frame, a tail, a wing, a man of no importance" [...] she would <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> recruit someone of greater standing, but she insisted that it was he whom she wanted for the task. Juan Diego agreed to return to the bishop to repeat his request. This he did on the morning of Sunday, December 10 when he found the bishop more compliant. The bishop, however, asked for a sign to prove that the apparition was truly of heaven. Third apparition: Juan Diego returned immediately to Tepeyac and, encountering the Virgin Mary reported the bishop's request for a sign; she condescended to provide one on the following day (December 11).|$|E
