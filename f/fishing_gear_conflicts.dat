It’s aims to (i) assess the current situation of the fishing effort and catches in the Waza Logone floodplain, (ii) evaluate the sustainability of fisheries practices, and (iii) provide a means to better understand the factors influencing conflicts and conflict resolution between fishers in the Waza Logone floodplain. Methodology consisted mainly of a rural appraisal technique and included an open workshop with 18 traditional and municipal authorities, leaders of international and national NGOs, an interview survey in 91 villages and a daily survey on fishermen, canoes and fishing materials, between August 2008 and June 2009 in 13 fishing spots.

A atividade se concentra em três espécies principais: tucunaré Cichla monoculus (capturado com anzol), pescada Plagioscion squamosissimus (capturado com rede e/ou anzol) e mapará Hypophthalmus marginatus (capturado com rede). Com o objetivo de caracterizar os pescadores e as pescarias do reservatório, criar cenários de aumento do esforço pesqueiro e prever os momentos de conflito pela escassez de recursos, foram levantadas informações da {{literatura}} e realizadas duas campanhas de coleta de dados nos anos de 1999 e 2000, envolvendo entrevistas com líderes comunitários e pescadores. As seguintes variáveis foram consideradas: desembarque por espécie-alvo (de acordo com os registros fornecidos pelas colônias de pescadores), artes de pesca, estratégias dos pescadores, conflitos e formas de apropriação do espaço e rendimentos da atividade. Estas variáveis foram inseridas em um modelo dinâmico, simulado no software Vensim PLE para um período de 10 anos a partir de 1999. Os resultados indicam que a pesca de anzol é a estratégia mais rentável, e que possíveis momentos de conflito devido à escassez de recursos podem acontecer em curto prazo (2005). A metodologia utilizada para as simulações e análises de risco também se revelou adequada à realidade local e ao conjunto de dados disponíveis.

40|$|Coastal {{resources}} in Tanzania {{have come under}} increasing pressure {{over the past three}} decades, which has led to a significant decline in the biodiversity and productivity of coastal ecosystems. The livelihoods of coastal communities that directly depend on these resources are consequently under increasing threat and vulnerability. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are one tool for managing coastal and marine resources that have been increasingly used in Tanzania. Promotion of alternative income generating activities (AIGA) is often a component of MPA management strategies to reduce fishing pressure and address poverty concerns. However, empirical evidence on whether these AIGA are successful in reducing pressure on fisheries, or their impact on poverty, is scarce and inconclusive. This paper seeks to contribute to this debate by investigating the linkages between household characteristics, MPA activities, and household choice of <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> The empirical analysis is based on household survey data from a sample of villages located along the coast of mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar. We find that some aspects of poverty increase the likelihood of using destructive <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> MPAs do not directly affect household choice of <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> However, households participating in AIGA are less likely to use destructive <b>fishing</b> <b>gear,</b> suggesting that MPA support to these activities in Tanzania has a positive influence on household choice of <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> We also find the use of destructive <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> is associated with higher consumption levels, whereas participation in AIGA does not significantly affect household consumption levels...|$|R
