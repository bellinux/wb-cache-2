5|$|After the Belgian Grand Prix on 2 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at various European race circuits between 4–7 September {{to prepare for}} the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari, Williams, BAR, Jordan and Minardi tested at the Mugello Circuit. Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari set the fastest times on the first and second days. The second day of testing was disrupted on six occasions after BAR test driver Takuma Sato went off the circuit, suffered an <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> failure and had a malfunctioning anti-stall system. BAR driver Olivier Panis and Minardi driver Alex Yoong both had problems with their clutch and gearboxes. On the final day Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1 minute and 24.226 seconds, four-tenths ahead of Panis. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent three days at his team's private test track the Fiorano Circuit where he did practice starts as well as testing of launch control and traction control.|$|E

25|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (ECU), {{provided}} by MoTeC, {{is used to}} monitor and optimise {{various aspects of the}} engine's performance. Numerous sensors in the car collect information which is then transmitted to the team, allowing them to monitor things such as tyre wear and fuel consumption and find potential problems with the car. The ECU is also used by officials during the scrutineering process.|$|E
25|$|Downshifting {{is similar}} to up-shifting but in reverse order, and is slower, at 600milliseconds, due to the engine's <b>Electronic</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Unit,</b> or ECU, needing to 'blip' the {{throttle}} so that the engine crankshaft speed can match the appropriate gear shaft speed. The car's computer senses the car slowing down, or more power required (during acceleration), and thus engages a lower gear on the shaft not in use, and then completes the downshift.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} {{new technology is}} the electronically controlled 'active differential'. An <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (ECU) uses inputs from multiple sensors, including yaw rate, steering input angle, and lateral acceleration—and adjusts the distribution of torque to compensate for undesirable handling behaviours like understeer. Active differentials used to play {{a large role in}} the World Rally Championship, but in the 2006 season the FIA has limited the use of active differentials to only those drivers who have not competed in the World Rally Championship in the last five years.|$|E

25|$|Most modern road use {{diesel engines}} are {{provided}} with an FRP valve in the intake manifold (usually mistaken {{by some as a}} petrol engine throttle body). In most basic applications this valve will close a flow of air mixture to the engine when the vehicle is switched off, preventing diesel engine runaway by starving the engine of oxygen; this will also make standard shutdown much smoother by eliminating compression and decompression rattle by making the pistons effectively work in vacuum. In more advanced control systems this FRP valve can be shut by an <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> when it senses runaway scenario.|$|E
25|$|A {{wastegate}} {{regulates the}} {{exhaust gas flow}} that enters the exhaust-side driving turbine and therefore the air intake into the manifold {{and the degree of}} boosting. It can be controlled by a boost pressure assisted, generally vacuum hose attachment point diaphragm (for vacuum and positive pressure to return commonly oil contaminated waste to the emissions system) to force the spring-loaded diaphragm to stay closed until the overboost point is sensed by the ecu or a solenoid operated by the engine’s <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> or a boost controller, but most production vehicles use a single vacuum hose attachment point spring-loaded diaphragm that can alone be pushed open, thus limiting overboost ability due to exhaust gas pressure forcing open the wastegate.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain of}} the ESC {{system is the}} <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (ECU). The various control {{techniques}} are embedded in it. Often, the same ECU is used for diverse systems {{at the same time}} (ABS, Traction control system, climate control, etc.). The input signals are sent through the input-circuit to the digital controller. The desired vehicle state is determined based upon the steering wheel angle, its gradient and the wheel speed. Simultaneously, the yaw sensor measures the actual state. The controller computes the needed brake or acceleration force for each wheel and directs via the driver circuits the valves of the hydraulic modulator. Via a Controller Area Network interface the ECU is connected with other systems (ABS, etc.) in order to avoid giving contradictory commands.|$|E

25|$|Typically ABS {{includes}} a central <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (ECU), four wheel speed sensors, {{and at least}} two hydraulic valves within the brake hydraulics. The ECU constantly monitors the rotational speed of each wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition indicative of impending wheel lock, it actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, thus reducing the braking force on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release braking pressure 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.|$|E
25|$|Häkkinen {{finished}} in second {{position at the}} European Grand Prix, having traded the lead position with Schumacher throughout the race. He followed up the result by taking sixth place at Monaco, fourth in Canada and a podium finish with second position in France. The day after the French Grand Prix, {{it was announced that}} Häkkinen would remain at McLaren for 2001. Häkkinen won the following race held in Austria, although his team were stripped of constructors' points due to missing seal on the <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> in Häkkinen's car. He took another podium finish with a second place in Germany, and later had another victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix where he took the lead of the World Drivers' Championship from Schumacher. Häkkinen raced to his second consecutive victory in Belgium, which included a simultaneous pass on Michael Schumacher and Ricardo Zonta in the Kemmel straight. Häkkinen later took second place in Italy, and retired with an engine failure in the United States. He rounded off the year with a second place in Japan where he conceded the World Championship to Schumacher, and held fourth position in the season closing race held in Malaysia.|$|E

500|$|First, the {{turbocharger}} {{was split}} and positioned alongside the Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H)—the generator harvesting heat {{energy from the}} exhaust manifold used to power the turbine—and positioned within the cylinder banks forming the 'V' configuration of the engine. In order to make this fit, Honda eschewed {{the use of a}} centrifugal fan in its single-stage compressor in favour of using several smaller fans positioned at intervals along a shaft. Although this would limit the ability of the turbocharger to build up the maximum amount of boost pressure, the 100kg/h fuel flow limit introduced in 2014 minimised the impact of this. The Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K)—the generator harvesting energy from the engine spinning while under braking—was positioned in front of the engine to deliver energy directly to the crankshaft, following the convention established with the introduction of the kinetic energy recovery system in [...] The batteries housing the energy harvested by the MGU-H and MGU-K were merged with the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> and positioned in front of the engine.

500|$|The [...] season saw teams running [...] "off-throttle blown diffusers", {{which created}} {{downforce}} by forcing fuel through {{the engine to}} produce exhaust gases and directing it over the diffuser when the driver was not applying the throttle. This concept was originally banned in incremental phases, with increasingly restrictive rules on what teams could and could not do, with a full ban to be applied from the 2011 British Grand Prix onwards. However, the incremental ban was controversial, with several teams applying for and receiving permission to circumvent the total ban. After discussion between the FIA and engine manufacturers, the original regulations were restored, with the full ban delayed until 2012. The regulations in 2012 governed {{the design of the}} exhaust with the teams agreeing to strict constraints on the position of the exhaust tailpipe. This resulted in the exhaust exiting the bodywork much higher up than in 2011, and no longer {{in the vicinity of the}} diffuser. Several teams, including Williams and Mercedes used the Young Driver Tests in Abu Dhabi as an opportunity to test parts for the 2012 season in the face of the ban. In October 2011, a clarification to the amended rules was issued, effectively banning [...] "exotic" [...] engine maps; in November, further amendments were introduced, completely banning the practice of blowing exhaust gasses over parts of the car to improve downforce, following a bid by several teams to allow it under certain conditions. Further amendments were made in February 2012 when Mercedes alerted the FIA to a loophole in the regulations that would allow teams to continue using a partially blown diffuser. The FIA responded by re-writing the software governing the engine's <b>Electronic</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> to close the loophole.|$|E
