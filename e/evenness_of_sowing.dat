40|$|Using donor-controlled, {{bottom-up}} equations {{to describe}} network collapse we systematically investigate the impact each species {{has on the}} survival or extinction of other species. Short of extinction, one can determine the integrated losses experienced by the ecosystem. These losses are aggregated into system level indicators, such as entropy, average gain/loss, average time to extinction, etc. The methodology is applied to 18 ecological flow networks available in the literature. We calculate the correlations between various indicators and determine high positive correlation between: number of nodes & maximal trophic level; connectedness & average entropy losses; number of nodes & average number of extinct nodes; and, maximum trophic level & <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> links. A high negative correlation was found between: number of nodes & connectedness; connectedness & maximal trophic level; maximum tropic level & average entropy loss; and, connectedness & <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> flows. Lastly, a low correlation was found between: average number of extinct compartments & <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> flows; number <b>of</b> nodes & <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> stocks; and, <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> flows & <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> stocks...|$|R

Information about species diversity for a national park is very important especially if its area fluctuated susceptibly. Two years after 2010 Merapi eruption, there are no research about species diversity and <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> Anuran in that place. The research is carried out during June-November 2012 which is dry season. The objective {{of this research is}} to study the species diversity and <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> Anuran in southern slope of Mount Merapi. The research is carried out in 6 locations; those are Kali Kuning, Telogo Muncar, Telogo Nirmolo, Petak Pitu, Bukit Turgo, and Bukit Plawangan. We used Visual Encounter Survey (VES) method combined with transect in Kali Kuning, Telogo Muncar, and Petak Pitu. VES method combined with time search in Telogo Nirmolo and Bukit Turgo. VES method combined with track exploration in Bukit Plawangan. Species diversity is analyzed with Shanon-Wiener diversity index. Species evenness is analyzed with Pielou evenness index. Total individuals each species is counted to know species abundance. Species diversity of anuran in southern slope of Mount Merapi is consisted of 12 species’ which is distributed in 6 locations.

Gestating <b>sows</b> were transferred from gestational crates to stalls or pens (group housing) 5 weeks before farrowing. All sows were moved to farrowing crates on d 109 of gestation. At weaning, back-fat thickness changes were lesser (p< 0. 05) in sows having back-fat thickness < 20 mm than that <b>of</b> <b>sows</b> with ≥ 20 mm back-fat thickness at 107 d of gestation. Group housed sows had greater (p< 0. 05) feed intake and shorter (p< 0. 05) weaning-to-estrus interval than that <b>of</b> <b>sows</b> in stalls. At weaning, back-fat thickness changes were lesser (p< 0. 05) in group housed <b>sows</b> than that <b>of</b> <b>sows</b> in stalls.

40|$|The Juvenile Hormone {{analogue}} s-methoprene is used {{to protect}} stored grain from pests such as the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.). The possibility that uneven application influences s-methoprene efficacy against this species was investigated in the laboratory. Adults of methoprene-susceptible strains were exposed for 14 days to wheat treated at doses of up to 0. 6 mg kg- 1, or to mixtures of treated and untreated wheat giving equivalent average doses. Adult mortality after exposure to treated wheat was negligible in all cases (3. 3 %) {{and there was no}} significant effect of either average dose or <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> application. In contrast, the number of adult progeny depended on both the average dose and <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> application. Average doses of 0. 3 and 0. 6 mg kg- 1 reduced the number of live F 1 adults by 99 - 100 % relative to the untreated wheat and no effect <b>of</b> <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> application was detected. At lower doses, however, efficacy tended to decrease with increasing unevenness of application. When adults from the parental generation were transferred to untreated wheat for another 14 days neither the average dose nor <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> application in the wheat from which they came had any significant effect on reproduction of these adults. This study demonstrates that uneven application can reduce the efficacy of s-methoprene against R. dominica, but that this is unlikely to influence the performance of s-methoprene against susceptible populations at target doses likely to be used in practice (e. g. 0. 6 mg kg- 1 in Australia).

Over a 2 -year period, we monitored the structure of soil fungal and bacterial communities in organic and mineral soil horizons in plots warmed by greenhouses for 18 years and in control plots. We found that microbial communities were stable over time but strongly structured by warming. Warming led to significant reductions in the <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> bacterial communities, while the <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> fungal communities increased significantly. These patterns were strongest in the organic horizon, where temperature change was greatest and were associated with {{a significant increase in the}} dominance of the Actinobacteria and significant reductions in the Gemmatimonadaceae and the Proteobacteria.
