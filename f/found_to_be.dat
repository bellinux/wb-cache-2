Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which have been <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
5|$|For example, when {{comparing}} the imaginary {{part of the}} refractive index k of stratospheric ash from 15km and 18km from the volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values around 700nm (around 0.009), while they differ significantly around 300nm.

5|$|Many {{superficial}} inspections {{were performed}} on the locomotive in 1980 and it was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in relatively sound mechanical condition.

One morning in January 1980, before the museum opened to the public, museum officials used compressed air to power the cylinders and move the wheels through the connecting rods {{for the first time since}} its last semi-operation.

The propulsion system was also <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a secondary source of noise: poor design of the exhaust mufflers, weight-saving measures in the generator mountings, and an incorrect voltage supply to the battery compartment exhaust fans were noise-creating factors found and eliminated during studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation.|$|E
