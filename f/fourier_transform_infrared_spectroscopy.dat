25|$|Nano-FTIR (nanoscale <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy)</b> is a {{scanning}} probe technique {{that can be}} considered as a combination of two techniques: <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (FTIR) and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). As s-SNOM, nano-FTIR is based on atomic-force microscopy (AFM), where a sharp tip is illuminated by an external light source and the tip-scattered light (typically back-scattered) is detected as a function of tip position. A typical nano-FTIR setup thus consists of an atomic force microscope, a broadband infrared light source used for tip illumination, and a Michelson interferometer acting as Fourier transform spectrometer. In nano-FTIR, the sample stage is placed in one of the interferometer arms, which allows for recording both amplitude and phase of the detected light (unlike conventional FTIR that normally does not yield phase information). Scanning the tip allows for performing hyperspectral imaging (i.e. complete spectrum at every pixel of the scanned area) with nanoscale spatial resolution determined by the tip apex size. The use of broadband infrared sources enables the acquisition of continuous spectra, which is a distinctive feature of nano-FTIR compared to s-SNOM.|$|E

500|$|Forensic {{chemistry}} is {{the application of}} chemistry and its subfield, forensic toxicology, in a legal setting. [...] A forensic chemist can assist {{in the identification of}} unknown materials found at a crime scene. [...] Specialists in this field have a wide array of methods and instruments to help identify unknown substances. [...] These include high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy, <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> and thin layer chromatography. [...] The range of different methods is important due to the destructive nature of some instruments and the number of possible unknown substances that can be found at a scene. Forensic chemists prefer using nondestructive methods first, to preserve evidence and to determine which destructive methods will produce the best results.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{forensic}} chemists rely {{on numerous}} instruments to identify unknown materials {{found at a}} crime scene. [...] The 20th century saw many advancements in technology that allowed chemists to detect smaller amounts of material more accurately. [...] The first major advancement in this century came during the 1930s with the invention of a spectrometer that could measure the signal produced with infrared (IR) light. [...] Early IR spectrometers used a monochromator and could only measure light absorption in a very narrow wavelength band. [...] It {{was not until the}} coupling of an interferometer with an IR spectrometer in 1949 by Peter Fellgett that the complete infrared spectrum could be measured at once. [...] Fellgett also used the Fourier transform, a mathematical method that can break down a signal into its individual frequencies, {{to make sense of the}} enormous amount of data received from the complete infrared analysis of a material. [...] Since then, <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (FTIR) instruments have become critical in the forensic analysis of unknown material because they are nondestructive [...] and extremely quick to use. [...] Spectroscopy was further advanced in 1955 with the invention of the modern atomic absorption (AA) spectrophotometer by Alan Walsh. [...] AA analysis can detect specific elements that make up a sample along with their concentrations, allowing for the easy detection of heavy metals such as arsenic and cadmium.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the change}} in the metal-to-ligand bond {{distance}} (M-L) between the HS and LS state, the vibrational modes of the M-L are going to be affected. Vibrational spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, are going to be sensitive to these M-L vibrational modes. Therefore, Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify which spin state is predominant in a SCO complex. [...] The spin crossover phenomenon is very sensitive to grinding, milling and pressure but Raman spectroscopy has the advantage that the sample does not require further preparation, which is in contrast to <b>Fourier</b> <b>Transform</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> FT-IR, techniques; highly colored samples may affect the measurements however. Raman spectroscopy is also advantageous because it allows perturbation of the sample with external stimuli in many ways in order to induce SCO. [...] Thermally induced spin crossover is due to the higher electronic degeneracies of the LS form and lower vibrational frequencies of the HS form, thus increasing the entropy. [...] Figure 5 shows the Raman spectrum of an iron(II) complex in the HS and LS state, emphasizing the changes in the M-L vibrational modes, where a shift from 2114cm−1 to 2070cm−1 corresponds to changes in the stretching vibrational modes of the thiocyanate ligand from a LS state to a HS state, respectively.|$|E

STM {{has been able to}} help understand the mechanisms of SAM formation as well as determine the important structural features that lend SAMs their integrity as surface-stable entities. In particular STM can image the shape, spatial distribution, terminal groups and their packing structure. AFM offers an equally powerful tool without the requirement of the SAM being conducting or semi-conducting. AFM has been used to determine chemical functionality, conductance, magnetic properties, surface charge, and frictional forces of SAMs. More recently, however, diffractive methods have also been used. The structure can be used to characterize the kinetics and defects found on the monolayer surface. These techniques have also shown physical differences between SAMs with planar substrates and nanoparticle substrates.|$|E
