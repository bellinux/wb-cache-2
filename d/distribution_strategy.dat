5|$|By 1940, {{the average}} {{production}} {{cost of an}} American feature was $400,000, a negligible increase over ten years. A number of small Hollywood companies had folded {{around the turn of}} the decade, including the ambitious Grand National, but a new firm, Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC), emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram. The double feature, never universal, was still the prevailing exhibition model: in 1941, 50 percent of theaters were double-billing exclusively, and others employed the policy part-time. In the early 1940s, legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures. Restrictions were also placed on the majors' ability to enforce blind bidding. These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more important as B movie suppliers. Genre pictures made at very low cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row, with even Republic's and Monogram's budgets rarely climbing over $200,000. Many smaller Poverty Row firms folded as the eight majors, with their proprietary distribution exchanges, now commanded about 95 percent of U.S. and Canadian box office receipts. In 1946, independent producer David O. Selznick brought his bloated-budget spectacle Duel in the Sun to market with heavy nationwide promotion and wide release. The <b>distribution</b> <b>strategy</b> was a major success, despite what was widely perceived as the movie's poor quality. The Duel release anticipated practices that fueled the B movie industry in the late 1950s; when the top Hollywood studios made them standard two decades after that, the B movie would be hard hit.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the <b>distribution</b> <b>strategies</b> {{implemented}} by foreign firms in emerging markets, and to investigate if they represent an opportunity for firms to innovate their practice. China is selected as the setting of the investigation as distribution is a critical determinant of business success for international firms operating there. A multiple-case study approach is adopted by investigating the <b>distribution</b> <b>strategies</b> of four Italian firms in China. The collected data consist of interviews with firm managers and their distributors. To ensure triangulation and cross-verify the findings from the primary data, secondary data consisting of sector reports and newspaper articles are analyzed. Results discuss how foreign firms develop their distribution system in China and suggest that emerging markets can enable reverse innovation in their <b>distribution</b> <b>strategies...</b>|$|R

The <b>distribution</b> <b>strategy</b> for the film was created and implemented by Artisan studio executive Steven Rothenberg. The film earned $1,512,054 in its limited release opening weekend. The film went on to gross $29,207,381 from 1,101 locations and placed at number two in the United States box office third opening weekend, surpassing the science fiction horror film Deep Blue Sea which cleared $19,107,643 weekend gross. The film secured its second place in its fourth weekend, behind another horror film The Sixth Sense, which cleared $26,681,262. The film descended at number three in its fifth weekend, at number five in its sixth weekend, and number eight in its seventh and eighth weekend during Labor Day. The film {{dropped out of the}} top-ten list in its tenth weekend until its last screening in 107 theaters in its seventeenth weekend, grossing $28,866 and placing in number sixty-three. By the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed $140,539,099 in the US and Canada in its total screening and produced $108,100,000 in other territories, having an overall gross of $248,639,099 (over 4,000 times its original budget). The Blair Witch Project was the tenth highest-grossing film in the US in 1999, and has since earned the reputation of becoming a sleeper hit.|$|E

Dread Lords focuses on the single player experience that consists of a Campaign mode and a [...] "Sandbox" [...] mode, and omits multiplayer. The game is notable for its artificial intelligence, which is challenging without being given resources and abilities not available to the player, as is common in the majority of strategy games. The game was a modest commercial success, and it was received favorably by critics, winning multiple Editor's Choice awards.

2500|$|Guess {{began in}} 1981 {{as a book}} of styles by Georges Marciano. [...] Maurice, Georges brother, was first sought by Georges to help with product development. Armand and Paul, also Georges' brothers, {{were in charge of}} {{distribution}} and advertising, respectively. [...] Armand ran distribution. Paul created the advertising, all of it in-house. Georges designed the clothes, burnishing Guess' signature style: stonewashed denim, lighter in color, softer and more form-fitting than the competitors. This initial chain of command later led to the earlier break-up of the brothers' cooperation with Georges selling his share of the Guess company to his other brothers due to a disagreement in a choice of product <b>distribution</b> <b>strategy.</b> Georges wanted to keep Guess in only the more exclusive stores, such as Bloomingdales. The remaining brothers in the disagreement wanted a larger distribution in KMart. Georges hated the idea. Different camps formed within the company, with each pledging allegiance to either Georges or the other three. Georges eventually gave in and sold his stake to his brothers in 1993 for $214.2 million. To finance the purchase, they had to borrow $210 million, and $105 million was still outstanding three years later. To raise money, the brothers decided to take Guess public. [...] Paul was the only remaining brother to ultimately lead Guess on his own.|$|E

The paper presents case studies of new <b>distribution</b> platforms and <b>strategies,</b> from content distributed on YouTube, {{to the rise of}} iROKOtv, to festival social media networks, to analogies with Fuse ODG’s AZONTO dance competitions. These examples show strategies arising out of an industry, which grew exponentially in an informal and ‘piratical’ environment (UNESCO 2010; Lobato 2012). The paper addresses new Nollywood’s desire for quality in Nigerian cinema through better investment, stronger copyright enforcement and more formalised business strategies (Jedlowski, 2012; Sacchi, 2010). Applying Lessig’s (2009) concept of hybrid economies, the paper highlights innovation and countervailing strategies, which add energy and value to Nigerian film within diasporan markets...|$|R
