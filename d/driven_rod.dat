The work {{presented}} extends {{and contributes}} to research in earthing and lightning protection and focuses on the transient behaviour of a <b>driven</b> <b>rod</b> earth electrode. Although previous {{work in this area}} has produced practical guidelines and models that may be used for lightning protection system design and analysis purposes, there has not been an investigation into the commonly encountered scenario of multiple layers of di erent soil types, particularly where high current densities cause ionisation to occur in the surrounding soil. In the research presented, the behaviour of a practical <b>driven</b> <b>rod</b> earth electrode subjected to peak impulse currents of up to 30 KA is analysed. Measurements obtained using a large-scale experiment arrangement are compared against results obtained using a time-domain circuit model simulation. It is shown that a single apparent resistivity value calculated from the steady state resistance equation and the measured steady state resistance {{can be used as a}} simpli cation for modelling the lightning current transient behaviour of a <b>driven</b> <b>rod</b> earth electrode in multi-layer soil.

To maximise the length of its <b>drive</b> <b>rod</b> and reduce its angulation, this was connected near to the furthest driven axle. The coupling rod between those axles was 'triangular', with an additional bearing mounted on its top edge, taking the thrust of the jackshaft <b>drive</b> <b>rod.</b> Unlike most connecting rods, this allows it to be mounted in the same plane as the coupling rod bearings. This reduces the overhung lengths of the crankpins and their bending loads.|$|R

The lower ends of {{the legs of the}} ladder cords are secured to the long rail under the slats. Their upper ends are attached to the <b>drive</b> <b>rod</b> in the housing, the elongated box above the slats. As the <b>drive</b> <b>rod</b> rotates, one leg of each ladder cord moves up while the other moves down, causing the angle of the slats to change. In one design, this rotation is achieved by pushing up or pulling down on a long handle called a tilt wand connected to the <b>drive</b> <b>rod</b> by a lever. Lift cords along the ladder cords are also attached to the rail. They pass through holes in the slats and into the housing above, where they go over pulleys, combine and exit through the cord lock. For safety it's important that the lock always works. A downward pull on the main lift cord raises the slats by the cords pulling up the rail below the slats. The cord lock holds the main lift cord to keep the slats up until the cord is pulled to release the lock. The safety lock made the cord lock easier to use.|$|R

40|$|Availability of {{land for}} {{conventional}} air-insulated substations is becoming increasingly difficult not only in urban but also in semiurban areas. When the land made available is highly uneven, the associated technoeconomic factors favors the erection of substations on a steplike-formed ground surface and such constructions are in service {{for more than ten}} years in some parts of southern India. Noting that the literature on the performance of ground grids in such a construction is rather scarce, the present work was taken up. Evaluation of the performance of earthing elements in steplike ground forms the main goal of the present work. For the numerical evaluation, a suitable boundary-based methodology is employed. This method retains the classical Galerkin approach for the conductors, while the interfaces are replaced by equivalent fictitious surface sources defined over unstructured mesh. Details of the implementation of this numerical method, along with special measures to minimize the computation, are presented. The performance of basic earthing elements, such as the <b>driven</b> <b>rod,</b> counterpoise, and simple grids buried in steplike ground, are analyzed and compared with that for the case with uniform soil surface.

40|$|When {{creating}} an electrical earth for a transformer with vertically driven earthing rods, problems can arise either because {{the ground is}} too hard or because the ground is too resistive to achieve the required earthing resistance. To assist in the planning of earthing installations a geographic information system (GIS) layer has been created. In its simplest form it consists of a colour coded map that indicates the most likely earthing installation: a single vertically <b>driven</b> <b>rod</b> (indicated by dark green); multiple vertically driven rods (indicated by light green); a horizontal trench, where a rod installation is unlikely (indicated by yellow); for difficult ground, a specialist installation (i. e. drilling; indicated by red). However, the GIS can be interrogated to provide site-specific information such as site conditions, likely depth of installation and quantity of earthing materials required. The GIS was created from a spatial model constructed from soil, superficial and bedrock geology that has been attributed with engineering strength and resistivity values. Calculations of expected earthing rod resistance, rod or trench length, and all possible combinations of ground conditions have been compared with the ‘likely’ conditions required {{for each of the}} four proposed installation scenarios to generate the GIS layer. The analysis has been applied to the electrical network distribution regions of Western Power Distribution, in the English Midlands, and UK Power Networks, which covers East Anglia, London and the SE of England.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{for the release of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to our natural environment is pervasive. However, the ability to accurately measure and predict VOC soil vapor concentrations is still limited. A polyethylene (PE) quantitative passive sampler using performance reference compounds and deployed via a hand driven probe is proposed as a solution. Additionally, a 1 D diffusion mass transfer model was developed in MATLAB to predict the mass uptake into the PE sampler over time. The model was then implemented to investigate the effects of PE size and deployment time on the detection limit of BTEX compounds. Preliminary testing of the deployment probe indicates that a design to secure the PE around the outside of a <b>driven</b> <b>rod</b> must include a protective cover over the PE during insertion. A perforated pipe design is suggested. After deployment and recovery, the PE is extracted into water. The extraction water is then analyzed by direct aqueous injection to GC/FID. The minimum concentration detectable in soil vapors, by this PE passive sampling method, was determined to be the product of the target compound's air-water partitioning coefficient and the analytical detection limit. Assuming a 5 ng/mL analytical detection limit, the minimum soil vapor detection limit for toluene was approximately 1. 25 mg/m 3. This limit would be similar for all BTEX compound and is above sub-slab vapor intrusion screening levels for the more toxic compounds such as benzene. This indicates that direct aqueous injection provides insufficient sensitivity and that purge and trap concentrations of VOCs is likely needed. It was also determined that a PE sampler, with dimensions as small as 5 "x 5 / 8 "x 0. 0005 ", could theoretically reach 10 mg/m 3 sensitivity within a 1 h deployment time. This result suggests potential applications of the sampler for rapid and accurate site characterization of BTEX compounds. by David G. Jensen. Thesis: M.

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{structure of}} a thunderstorm consists essentially of a positive dipole, with values of the segregated charge estimated at 20 coulombs. Between the main charge centres there exists mixed charge, of both signs, {{of the order of}} 1000 to 1500 coulombs. As this charge is generated in regions where the temperature is well below 0 C the phenomena have been associated with the charging of ice. In recent years several workers have found that if a temperature gradient is set up in ice, the colder part acquires a positive charge and the warmer a negative charge. This has been explained by assuming that protons migrate from the warmer to the colder part of the ice, and Mason and Latham (1961 a) have put forward a quantitative theory, which is in very good agreement with their experimental results. In the present work the charging due to the momentary contact of vapour grown ice crystals at different temperatures was investigated. Ice crystals were grown in a diffusion chamber on a fine insulating fibre and a fine horizontal wire supported by a cam <b>driven</b> <b>rod.</b> Contact could be made between ice crystals grown at different levels in the diffusion chamber and the fibre then raised into a bronze Faraday cylinder, which was connected to a Vibron electrometer adapted for measuring single charges. Contact times of the order of 1 / 100 th second were employed, this being the time for maximum charge separation predicted by Mason and Latham’s theory. However, although temperature differences of up to 10 C were involved no charging was observed. When water droplets are nucleated just below 0 C a strong ice shell is formed and further freezing produces a pressure inside the drop which finally causes the drop to burst. Mason and Maybank (1960) measured the charging which accompanies the bursting and attributed it to the migration of protons along the radial temperature gradient set up in the ice shell; the charge separation being caused by an excess of either the outer of inner surface of the shell carried away when the drop bursts. Mason and Latham (1961) suggest that this process may account for the charging of a hall pellet growing by the accretion of supercooled droplets. An attempt to measure the charging of a single supercooled droplet, brought into contact with an ice surface, was unsuccessful, but the charging of nucleated supercooled droplets was observed. One millimetre diameter droplets suspended from the insulating fibre were cooled to just below 0 C and then nucleated by dropping a small piece of solid carbon dioxide into the diffusion chamber. The droplets were raised into the Faraday cylinder after freezing was completed and no charging was observed unless fragmentation of the drop had taken place. The results obtained suggested that the charging was too large to he accounted for by the temperature gradient theory, and also that the sign of the charge remaining on the drop was determined by the amount of water present when the drop bursts...|$|E

40|$|Two new four-element {{fast wave}} current drive antennas have been {{installed}} on DIII-D. These antennas {{are designed for}} 10 -s pulses at 2 MW each in the frequency range of 30 to 120 MHz. Each element comprises two poloidal segments fed in parallel in order to optimize plasma coupling at {{the upper end of}} the frequency range. The antennas are mounted on opposite sides of the vacuum vessel, in ports designated 0 {degrees} and 180 {degrees} after their toroidal angle. Each antenna array is fed by a single transmitter. The power is first split two ways by means of a 3 -dB hybrid coupler, then each of these lines feeds a resonant loop connecting a pair of array elements. The power transfer during asymmetric phasing is shunted between resonant loops by a decoupler. The resonant loops are fitted with line stretchers so that multiple frequencies of operation are possible without reconfiguring the transmission line. Commissioning of these antennas has been underway since June 1994. Several deficiencies in the transmission line system were uncovered during initial vacuum conditioning, including problems with the transmission line insulators and with the <b>drive</b> <b>rods</b> for the variable elements. The former was solved by replacing the original alumina insulators, and the latter has been avoided during operation to date by positioning the tuners to avoid high voltage appearing on the <b>drive</b> <b>rods.</b> A modified design for the <b>drive</b> <b>rods</b> will be implemented before RF operations resume operation June 1995. New transmitters were procured from ABB for the new antennas and were installed in parallel with the antenna installation.
