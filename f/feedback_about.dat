5|$|The patient's own {{description}} {{is the best}} measure of pain; they will usually be asked to estimate intensity {{on a scale of}} 0–10 (with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain they have ever felt). Some patients, however, may be unable to give verbal <b>feedback</b> <b>about</b> their pain. In these cases you must rely on physiological indicators such as facial expressions, body movements, and vocalizations such as moaning.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Toshiyuki Itahana. In common with his typical drawing style for characters, Itahana created Wol to be a heroic fantasy character that both fitted within and did not conform to earlier Final Fantasy titles. He and other designers created the multiple job outfits to further convey the fantasy setting. After its reveal, some changes {{were made to the}} character's initial costume: due to negative player <b>feedback</b> <b>about</b> the amount of skin shown, the Onion Swordsman outfit was adjusted to be more covering. The game's environments were designed by Takako Miyake, who had previously worked on console Final Fantasy titles. She did not change her working style for Mobius Final Fantasy: all the assets were designed in high definition, and only adjusted slightly when they were brought into the mobile environment. The visual effects were handled by company veteran Shintaro Takai, whose main preoccupation was to make sure the game did not slow down during the flashier visual combat effects due to hardware constraints. The cutscenes were not affected by these issues.|$|E

30|$|Limitation L- 1 {{essentially}} {{indicates the}} necessity of a trade-off between security and cost. The availability of <b>feedbacks</b> <b>about</b> security and cost will facilitate the defense to achieve an optimized trade-off. This motivates us to employ the canary mechanism to collect <b>feedbacks.</b> More details <b>about</b> it will be discussed shortly. Those feedbacks in turn provide awareness of the attacked data structures, which can be leveraged to address limitation L- 2. The intuition behind is that such awareness can enable the defense to include the attacked data structures and exclude the safe ones for randomization.|$|R

25|$|Excessive {{measures}} {{of performance and}} constant reactivity to performance appraisals challenge the very purpose {{of the system of}} performance appraisals, but performance evaluations can still offer organizations <b>feedback</b> <b>about</b> their practices. If performance evaluations did not accurately measure individual's abilities and productivity, it would be fruitless to continue to execute a system of constant performance evaluations. However, a phenomenon known as the performance paradox seems to suggest that performance evaluations may not be altogether futile.|$|E

30|$|Although {{a number}} of studies have {{examined}} EFL teachers’ beliefs of feedback on student writing, few have investigated teachers’ <b>feedback</b> beliefs <b>about</b> student oral activities like oral presentations. To fill this research gap, this study explores three experienced EFL teachers’ beliefs <b>about</b> <b>feedback</b> on oral presentations in terms of the nature, focus, interpersonal functions, strategies and source of teacher feedback. Using semi-structured interviews and classroom observations, this study identified six major beliefs <b>about</b> <b>feedback</b> on student oral presentations and provided implications regarding how EFL teachers provide effective feedback to enhance student performance in oral presentations.|$|R

Warnings are marked with a green underline. Background compilation does not generate executable code, since it requires a different compiler than the one used to generate executable code. Background compilation was initially introduced with Microsoft Visual Basic but has now been expanded for all included languages.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} if criticism against the women was justified, Sir Alan appointed both as project managers for this task. Claire, who reined in her aggressive side in response, earned praise from her team and Nick, while Lucinda received surprisingly good <b>feedback</b> <b>about</b> her leadership, even impressing Margaret. Of the two, Sugar held reservation that Lucinda lacked force of character {{to put her}} foot down, after she backed down from a suggestion to have manufacturers on both of Alpha's sales teams, hoping they could convey enthusiasm, when she was met by silence from Jennifer, Lindi and Raef.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} ego {{depletion}} {{do not appear}} to be a product of mood or arousal. In most studies, mood and arousal has not been found to differ between participants who exerted self-control and those who did not. Likewise, mood and arousal was not related to final self-control performance. The same is true for more specific mood items, such as frustration, irritation, annoyance, boredom, or interest as well. <b>Feedback</b> <b>about</b> success and failure of the self-control efforts does not appear to affect performance. In short, the decline in self-control performance after exerting self-control appears to be directly related to the amount of self-control exerted and cannot be easily explained by other, well-established psychological processes.|$|E

25|$|MTV.com {{experiment}}ed with entirely video-based layouts between 2005 and 2007. The experiment began in April 2005 as MTV Overdrive, a streaming video service that supplemented the regular MTV.com website. Shortly after the 2006 Video Music Awards, which were streamed on MTV.com and heavily utilized the MTV Overdrive features, MTV introduced a massive change for MTV.com, transforming the entire site into a Flash video-based entity. Much of users' <b>feedback</b> <b>about</b> the Flash-based site was negative, demonstrating a dissatisfaction with videos that played automatically, commercials {{that could not}} be skipped or stopped, and the slower speed of the entire website. The experiment ended in February 2006 as MTV.com reverted to a traditional HTML-based website design with embedded video clips, in the style of YouTube and some other video-based websites.|$|E

It will be integrated on the space station in preparation for future SpaceX flights to the orbiting complex. The unit allows for communication between ISS and SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft via a UHF radio. Commands from SpaceX can be forwarded through ISS to CUCU and on to Dragon. Similarly, telemetry from Dragon and CUCU can be forwarded down through ISS for monitoring by SpaceX and NASA ground-based mission control. The Crew Command Panel (CCP) provides <b>feedback</b> <b>about</b> {{the state of the}} Dragon vehicle to astronauts aboard ISS. It additionally provides some simple commanding capability to the astronauts to be used during the Dragon approach to ISS.|$|E
25|$|Using <b>feedback</b> <b>about</b> the {{original}} characters, Akihiko Yoshida was brought on as main character designer. While the team {{thought he would}} refuse due to his busy schedule, Yoshida was willing to join the project {{as a number of}} staff members at his company CyDesignation were fans of Nier. Yoshida joined a little later than usual in the process, so Taro gave him a general guideline of sleek designs with black as the dominant color. As opposed to {{the original}} Nier, which was released in two versions with a different version of the main protagonist for western tastes, the team decided to have the game feature the same protagonist in all versions, focusing on creating a high-quality Japanese role-playing game rather than making adjustments for its western release. This wish for a uniform international appearance was another reason why the team brought in Yoshida. The Commander, Adam, and Eve were designed by Yuya Nagai. Square Enix artist Toshiyuki Itahana handled the redesigns for Devola and Popola. The enemy concept art was handled by Hisayoshi Kijima, while environmental artwork was done by Kazuma Koda, Yasuyuki Kaji, and Shohei Kameoka: environmental design was a collaborative effort with Yoko, and the team strove to make the environments appear like places players would visit in the real world. One of the challenges faced when creating the character models was making them seem alive despite their mechanical nature.|$|E
