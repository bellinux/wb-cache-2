25|$|Compared {{with a year}} earlier, September 2017 {{passenger}} numbers {{increased by}} 2.7% to 4.464million (an increase of 117,900 over September 2016). The following changes were recorded amongst <b>individual</b> <b>passenger</b> traffic categories: North Atlantic traffic +11.9% (330,800 passengers); other long-haul traffic +4.4% (312,800 passengers); UK traffic +3.5% (352,100 passengers); European scheduled traffic +1.9% (3.065million passengers); Irish traffic +0.2% (131,600 passengers); European charter traffic +0.1% (271,300 passengers). Air transport movements increased by 0.8% to 27,220. Cargo volume increased by 27.3% to 8,409 metric tonnes. Key to continuing growth in passenger traffic was the increase in long-haul traffic (which in turn drove the increase in cargo traffic). This was driven by additional passengers travelling to and from Hong Kong (+64%), New York (+49.9%) and Tianjin (+28.4%). The increase in short-haul traffic was driven by growth in passenger traffic to and from Paris (+30.7%) and Milan (+3.4%).|$|E

5000|$|By 2030 the {{so-called}} Mobility Pricing {{will be introduced}} in Switzerland - for rail transport as well as road traffic transport.

As {{more and more people}} work in the cities but live in the agglomeration, the individual citizens do not bear all the transport costs caused by them. Although the rail and road network constantly will be expanded, especially during rush hours not all bottlenecks will be eliminated. Mobility Pricing is scheduled to break these traffic spikes. An incentive-based transport policy congestion may avoid utilize capacity and save costs. Moreover, also further measures such as flexible working hours, adjusted school hours, home office or carpooling may be introduced.|$|E

50|$|The CAFE {{achieved}} by a given {{fleet of vehicles}} in a given model year is the production-weighted harmonic mean fuel economy, expressed in miles per USgallon (mpg), of a manufacturer's fleet of current model year passenger cars or light trucks with a {{gross vehicle weight rating}} (GVWR) of 8,500 pounds (3,856 kg) or less (but also including medium-duty passenger vehicles, such as large sport-utility vehicles and passenger vans, with GVWR up to 10,000 pounds), produced for sale in the United States. The CAFE standards in a given model year define the CAFE levels that manufacturers' fleets are required to meet in that model year, specific levels depending on the characteristics and mix of vehicles produced by each manufacturer. If the average fuel economy of a manufacturer's annual fleet of vehicle production falls below the applicable requirement, the manufacturer must either apply sufficient CAFE credits (see below) to cover the shortfall or pay a penalty, currently $5.50 per 0.1 mpg under the standard, multiplied by the manufacturer's total production for the U.S. domestic market. Congress established both of these provisions explicitly in EPCA, as amended in 2007 by EISA.

50|$|Some {{skyscraper}} {{buildings and}} other types of installation feature a destination operating panel where a passenger registers their floor calls before entering the car. The system lets them know which car to wait for, instead of everyone boarding the next car. In this way, travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for <b>individual</b> <b>passengers,</b> and the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank. Although travel time is reduced, passenger waiting times may be longer as they will not necessarily be allocated the next car to depart. During the down peak period the benefit of destination control will be limited as passengers have a common destination.|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decades, the {{modelling}} of transport demand by activity based methods has gained consid-erable {{attention from the}} scientific community. Such demand models offer a greater modelling flexibility than traditional models, by modelling transport demand as a phenomenon which emerges from the de-sire to perform activities at different locations, as opposed to more traditional models where an origin destination demand matrix of trips is distributed over different routes and modes. One of the drawbacks of the activity based paradigm is that data related to activities {{is more difficult to}} collect than traffic counts. Modern technologies, such as smart card ticketing systems and smart phones, allow us to collect more detailed accounts of the movements of <b>individual</b> <b>passengers.</b> This gives us the possibility to analyse consecutive journeys and therefore the time a passenger spends in a certain location. This information can be very useful from an activity based modelling perspective. In this paper we take an exploratory approach to derive important activity time intervals from smart card data. We apply a clustering algorithm on the intervals observed at individual stations to detect which time intervals capture enough activities. We then construct a tree-based labelling algorithm that allows us to label the activities and analyse activity chains of <b>individual</b> <b>passengers.</b> We count pairs of consecutive activity labels, visualise the results as a network and calculate which triplets of consecutive activities occur most often. Using this approach, we are able to identify activity patterns that differ from the typical time windows associated with home-work activities. ...|$|R
