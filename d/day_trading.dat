25|$|Outside of academia, the {{controversy}} surrounding market timing is primarily focused on <b>day</b> <b>trading</b> conducted by individual investors and the mutual fund trading scandals perpetrated by institutional investors in 2003. Media coverage of these issues has been so prevalent that many investors now dismiss market timing as a credible investment strategy. Unexposed insider trading, accounting fraud, embezzlement and pump and dump strategies are factors that hamper an efficient, rational, fair and transparent investing, because they may create fictitious company's financial statements and data, leading to inconsistent stock prices.|$|E

From an economic perspective, many professional money managers and financial advisors shy away from <b>day</b> <b>trading,</b> arguing that the reward simply does not justify the risk.

25|$|In most Western nations, Christmas Day is {{the least}} active {{day of the year}} for {{business}} and commerce; almost all retail, commercial and institutional businesses are closed, and almost all industries cease activity (more than any other day of the year), whether laws require such or not. In England and Wales, the Christmas <b>Day</b> (<b>Trading)</b> Act 2004 prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. Scotland is currently planning similar legislation. Film studios release many high-budget movies during the holiday season, including Christmas films, fantasy movies or high-tone dramas with high production values to hopes of maximizing the chance of nominations for the Academy Awards.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} the towpath are visible at a bridge under the railway {{immediately}} north of Derby railway station.

In 1999, shares of Qualcomm rose in value by 2,619% and 12 other large-cap stocks each rose over 1,000%. Even though the Nasdaq stock market index rose 85.6% and the S 500 stock market index rose 19.5% in 1999, more stocks fell in value than rose in value, as investors sold stocks in slower growing companies to invest in Internet stocks.|$|E

2500|$|The Christmas <b>Day</b> (<b>Trading)</b> Act 2004 (c 26) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It {{prevents}} shops over 280 m²/3,000 sq ft {{from opening}} on Christmas Day in England and Wales. Shops {{smaller than the}} limit are not affected. The Act {{was introduced to the}} House of Commons by Kevan Jones, MP for North Durham as a Private Member's Bill on 7 January 2004. The aim of the Act was to keep Christmas Day a [...] "special" [...] day, whereby all major retailers would be closed. Although it was traditional for major retailers to close on 25 December, some retailers, such as Woolworths, began to open some stores in the late 1990s. Both religious groups and shop worker unions were against the idea of Christmas openings, leading to pressure on the Government to pass legislation to prevent the practice. In 2006, the Scottish Parliament debated a similar law that would apply to shops in Scotland. The law was enacted in 2007 and it contained special provisions for New Year's Day retail activities too.|$|E

5000|$|Drawing {{heavily on}} the anthropological literature, Benedicktsson argues that a {{distinct}} type of Melanesian market that is substantially different to other Asian markets, can be identified.

Prices are set {{at the start of the}} <b>day's</b> <b>trade,</b> and rarely change. Haggling and aggressive selling are rarely practised.
