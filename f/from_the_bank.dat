5|$|On November 29, 1820, the Assembly {{chartered}} the Bank of the Commonwealth, {{another source}} from which debtors could obtain money. Creditors {{did not want}} to accept payment from either the Bank of Kentucky or the Bank of the Commonwealth; the notes of the former were depreciated {{due to a lack of}} capital and the latter had no capital and no guarantee of state credit. In December 1820, the Assembly modified the replevin law to state that creditors who would accept payment in notes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of the Commonwealth but not the Bank of Kentucky would be forced to wait three months to collect on a debt. The wait was one year if the creditor accepted only notes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of Kentucky, and it remained two years for creditors who would not accept notes from either.|$|E
5|$|Receipt of Banking Services: A Lebanese Identity Card holder {{can use the}} Lebanese Identity Card as {{identity}} verification document when opening bank account, withdrawing money <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> or receiving money transfers in the Republic of Lebanon. It is easier for a Lebanese Identity Card holder to also take loan <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> whether you work in an identifiable institution or not. This is because their identity can be easily verified and the banks are confident {{that they can be}} traced in the event of loan default based on their PIN or biometric information stored on the Lebanese Identity Card.|$|E
5|$|A second {{important}} decision in which Owsley was a participant {{was the case}} of Blair, etc. v. Williams, which invalidated the Kentucky Replevin Act of 1820. This law granted debtors a two-year grace period in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept notes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of Kentucky. Owsley and his colleagues opined that this law was in violation of the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The decision was extremely unpopular with the Commonwealth's citizens, but it was re-affirmed by the court's opinion in the related case of Lapsley v. Brashcars and Barr.|$|E
2500|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> {{point of}} view, when a debit card {{is used to}} pay a merchant, the payment causes a {{decrease}} in the amount of money <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> owes to <b>the</b> cardholder. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> point of view, your debit card account is <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> liability. [...] A decrease to <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> liability account is a debit. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> point of view, when a credit card is used to pay a merchant, the payment causes an increase in the amount of money <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> is owed by <b>the</b> cardholder. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> point of view, your credit card account is <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> asset. An increase to <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> asset account is a debit. Hence, using a debit card or credit card causes a debit to the cardholder's account in either situation when viewed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> perspective.|$|R

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>bank</b> views <b>the</b> {{transaction}} <b>from</b> {{a different}} perspective but follows the same rules: <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> vault cash (asset) increases, which is a debit; {{the increase in the}} customer's account balance (liability <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> perspective) is a credit. [...] A customer's periodic bank statement generally shows transactions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> perspective, with bank deposits characterized as credits and withdrawals as debits.|$|R
5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} attack and travels to Russia where he locates Simonova and learns that Trevelyan, who had faked his own death, {{was the head of}} Janus. Simonova tracks {{computer}} traffic to Cuba and she and Bond travel there and locate Trevelyan, who reveals his plan to steal money <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of England before erasing all of its financial records with the GoldenEye, concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy. Bond and Simonova destroy the satellite facility, killing Trevelyan and Grishenko in the process.|$|E
5|$|By December12, Palau {{received}} a US$100,000 grant from USAID and US$25,000 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of Guam for relief efforts. On December13, the Government of Japan offered ¥5million (US$60,000) worth of emergency goods, such as jerry cans and water purifiers, through the Japan International Cooperation Agency. The following day, the Republic of Korea provided US$50,000 in humanitarian assistance to Palau through the local Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|Governors who had {{previously}} been legislators have generally had greater success in achieving their legislative goals while governor. Three speakers of the house have become governor. Governor Joseph A. Wright had the worst relations of any governor with the assembly. He twice delivered speeches to a joint session where he harangued them for what he perceived to be corruption, accusing them of taking bribes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of Indiana. The legislature responded by overriding all his anti-banking vetoes. He was so disliked by his own party that he was expelled from it after his term.|$|E

5|$|Myers {{resigned}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> in 1867 {{and moved}} to Hornellsville, New York. There he bought a photography gallery and ran the business for several years. Myers met Mary Hawley in Hornellsville and married her on November 8, 1871. She was 7 years younger, being born in 1849. In 1873 Myers took up an interest in making hydrogen gas and ballooning. The couple moved back to Mohawk from Hornellsville in 1875 and began activities of balloon manufacturing and flying. Mary became his lab assistant and later a balloon pilot known as Carlotta, the Lady Aeronaut.|$|E
5|$|Objects from Puerto Rico are {{constantly}} featured in specialized magazines, in both {{national and international}} distribution. The Puerto Rican dollars that were collected by the government, were burned between January 16–24, 1925, drastically {{reducing the amount of}} surviving notes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of Puerto Rico. The Great Depression reduced their numbers further, since necessity prevented the collection of pesos in large denominations. Thus less than five exemplars are known to exist of the 100 and 200 peso banknotes issued by El Banco Español de Puerto Rico and the 5 and 10 dollars Series F bills published by the Bank of Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|A loyal clubman, Trumble {{served on}} the {{committee}} of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) from 1900–01 to 1910–11 and was made a life member in 1904. In 1911 he resigned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> to become MCC club secretary; a position he held for 27years until his death. In this role, he played a leading part in reconciling the club and the Victorian Cricket Association {{after a period of}} some friction between the two bodies. He was instrumental in attracting quality cricketers to the club including Bert Ironmonger, whom Trumble saw play on a visit to Queensland. During his term as secretary, the Melbourne Cricket Ground was expanded to a capacity of over 70,000spectators.|$|E
5|$|As {{the club}} was {{dissatisfied}} with this arrangement, it launched plans to establish its own venues. First it needed to secure a lot, and in the late 1920s lied its eyes on a parcel of land owned by Hamar Jernstøperi. However, the lot was sold to Oplandske Kreditbank in 1930 and the club had to negotiate purchasing the lot <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> The club established a new committee {{to look into the}} stadium issue. Hamar IL was invited to become part-owner of the venue, but they chose to remain at Hamar stadion. As Briskebyen was not able to secure a partner to share the costs with, opposition towards the project grew within the club. Yet, the decision to build the venue was taken by Briskebyen FL's annual meeting on 15 April 1934, with construction starting on 26 April.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{suggested}} that Congress should charter the National Bank with a capitalization of $10million, one-fifth {{of which would}} be handled by the Government. Since the Government did not have the money, it would borrow the money <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> itself, and repay the loan in ten even annual installments. The rest was to be available to individual investors. The bank was to be governed by a twenty-five member board of directors that was to represent a large majority of the private shareholders, which Hamilton considered essential for his being under a private direction. Hamilton's bank model had many similarities to that of the Bank of England, except Hamilton wanted to exclude the Government from being involved in public debt, but provide a large, firm, and elastic money supply for the functioning of normal businesses and usual economic development, among other differences. For tax revenue to ignite the bank, it was the same as he had previously proposed; increases on imported spirits: rum, liquor, and whiskey.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, {{the site}} and its {{outstanding}} debt of £70million were bought <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of America by Hong Kong-based development company, Parkview International, for £10million. Following resolution of creditors' claims, it acquired the freehold title in May 1996. In November 1996 plans for the redevelopment of the site were submitted and outline consent was received in May 1997. Detailed consent {{for much of the}} site was granted in August 2000, and the rest in May 2001. The company received full possession of the site in 2003. Having purchased the site, Parkview started work on a £1.1billion project to restore the building and to redevelop the site into a retail, housing and leisure complex.|$|E
5|$|To {{link the}} new {{developments}} around Battersea Power Station to Battersea Park, in 2004 a new curved footbridge was built beneath {{the southern end}} of Chelsea Bridge. The footbridge was built offsite in four sections, transported by road to the King George V Dock where it was assembled, and the completed structure floated down the river and hoisted into position. It is planned that once the riverfront in the area has been opened to the public, following the completion of the rebuilding of Battersea Power Station into a commercial development, the new bridge will form part of the Thames Path. The new bridge curves out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> overhanging the river bank by , and cost £600,000 to build.|$|E
