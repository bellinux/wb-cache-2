50|$|Yo-yo, pile-up, or pilewind, hoists use yo-yo type devices {{instead of}} {{helically}} grooved drums. The yo-yos lines are coiled into overlapping layers of cable {{in the narrow}} slots. The pile-up drum hoists are usually used in low load. As the hoists are narrower than helically <b>grooved</b> <b>drum</b> hoists, these {{can be used in}} the places with limited space. Pile-up drum hoists can be mounted in many locations including ceiling, floor or wall mounting. Typical applications are to have a pile-up drum hoist with many pulleys to control a batten. Since the line is piled up on itself, this type of drum hoist provides a zero fleet angle solution.|$|E
30|$|The {{spiral groove}} {{polishing}} experiments show that active profiling and polishing {{can increase the}} accuracy of the shape and the surface quality of a <b>grooved</b> <b>drum,</b> and has good polishing effectiveness. The problems in which deterministic computer control of the spiral groove polishing is applied, the removal amount is difficult to determine, and a polishing tool is required, are all solved. At the same time, a reference is provided to resolve the free-abrasive tool-less polishing problem.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Only {{the basic}} wall {{thickness}} of drum is taken under consideration in traditional parallel <b>grooved</b> <b>drum</b> strength analysis, {{which is quite}} conservative for ignoring {{the thickness of the}} groove. So in this paper, it is aimed at comparing the strength simulation results for two drum models with and without the thickness of the groove and analyzing the stress distribution of the drum structure, which provides reference for the structure design and optimization of the drum...|$|E

50|$|Line shaft hoists {{can also}} use yo-yo type devices instead of {{helically}} <b>grooved</b> <b>drums.</b> Yo-yo hoists are typically used where lighter loads are imposed (e.g., for operating an Austrian puff curtain). Because yo-yos lines are wrapped over themselves, the velocity and travel of the lines are relatively difficult to accurately control.|$|R
50|$|To avoid lateral {{drift of}} the batten as the lift lines pay {{out of the}} <b>grooved</b> <b>drums,</b> the helical <b>groove</b> {{orientation}} on the drums of the line shaft may be alternated between drums to balance competing fleet angles. However the elimination of drift by this method is typically compromised by limited batten travel.|$|R
30|$|The {{spiral groove}} on the {{periphery}} of a <b>grooved</b> <b>drum</b> has a trade-off between a sinusoid and an exponential curve. The left and right sides are both closed, and recirculation is conducted. At a location near both ends, the pitch and rotation angle decrease to zero in a gradual manner, and then reverse. The major immediate section is similar to a linear segment on an expanded plane. The pitch and rotational angle remain essentially constant. The error of linear substitution is 7.063 % [42]. Therefore, the motion parameter of the immediate section can be approximated through Eq. (13). Specific parameters such as the workpiece parameters (D, S), motion parameters of the abrasive balls (N, R), and movement parameters of the workpiece (n) are substituted into Eq. (13) in accordance with the verification scheme, and P is then calculated under different conditions.|$|E
40|$|Random winding {{is widely}} used for the {{preparation}} of yarn packages used {{in a variety of}} textile processes. Ribboning caused by overwinding of yarn turns at certain places within the package is a basic problem encountered in this process. Standard random winders incorporate some means of ribbon breaking, which strictly speaking have limited effectiveness. The research reported in thesis was undertaken to realise a random winder capable of detecting the occurrence of ribboning, and taking the ribbon breaking action at these precise times, and thereby achieve 'active' ribbon breaking. Such a winder was realised by the addition of suitable transducers to a standard random winder, which could be controlled by a PC. Winding trials carried out using this equipment established the effectiveness of the concept and also the greater freedom from ribboning the method achieved in comparison with other available methods. Unwinding trials carried out by suitably modifying the winder for measuring yarn unwinding tension were also used to establish the effectiveness of active ribbon breaking. Preliminary experiments carried out on the above apparatus showed the possibility of constructing a Angle of Double Traverse (ADT) diagram on the VDU of the PC during winding operations, which could serve as a useful aid to follow the progress of the winding operation. It was very useful for showing the occurrence of major and minor ribboning in the wound package, and also for visually indicating the effectiveness of the ribbon breaking procedures. The diagram was of further use in studying the nature of package driving by the <b>grooved</b> <b>drum.</b> The case of driving a deformable body such as a yarn package on a comparatively non-deformable <b>grooved</b> <b>drum</b> is important for understanding how the package rotates without any obvious slipping. By varying the winding conditions, it was in fact shown that some measurable slip occurs, and these relationships were experimentally established. Computer simulation is useful to determine the stresses within a wound package, particularly as these cannot be measured using conventional techniques. The results of such a simulation carried out on a random wound package and the comparison of the results with those obtained for a precision wound package are also presented...|$|E
30|$|In summary, current {{studies on}} the {{finishing}} of a free-abrasive have mainly focused on improving the surface quality without involving the surface modification. In addition, current {{studies on the}} polishing of free-abrasives mainly focused on the movement and control of a single abrasive grain, and research into the different parts has been lacking. The shape and structure of a spiral groove restrict its use as a polishing tool. Therefore, the free-abrasive grain of tool-less finishing is {{an effective way to}} improve the surface quality and accuracy of the shape of a non–machined spiral groove. In this paper, the spiral groove of a revolving body is taken as the research object. A method used to make a helical movement of a workpiece, and cut and polish an abrasive grain, is proposed. The principle of the relative motion of the abrasive ball trajectory is studied. The trajectory and design helix are in concordance with a mathematical model. The <b>grooved</b> <b>drum</b> parts were polished and tested to verify that not only can the error {{in the shape of the}} helical groove be corrected but the surface roughness of the helical groove can also be reduced, and the helical groove of the rotating body can be repaired and polished, providing a theoretical basis for free-abrasive tool polishing without a modification.|$|E

30|$|When {{a spiral}} groove is formed using superplastic molding, {{precision}} casting, additive manufacturing, or other non-mechanical processing technology, {{it is difficult}} to meet the molding precision required for direct use, and the surface quality and accuracy of the shape need to be improved through a finishing process. In view of the poor reachability of the current tool-based polishing process, a tool-less polishing method using free-abrasive grains for complex spiral grooves is proposed. With this method, by controlling the movement of the workpiece, the design basis and relative motion of the abrasive particles along a helical path remain consistent, resulting in a better polishing profile. A spiral groove of a revolving body is taken as the research object; the influence of the installation method and the position of the parts, as well as the effect of the rotational speed of the abrasive ball on its relative motion along a helical trajectory, are studied, and the polishing cutting process of an abrasive ball is reasonably simplified. A consistent mathematical model of the trajectory of an abrasive ball relative to the design helix is constructed. The <b>grooved</b> <b>drum</b> parts are verified through a polishing experiment. The spiral groove of the revolving body is modified and polished. Experiments show that the process not only corrects the shape a spiral groove error, but also reduces the surface roughness of a spiral groove. This study provides a theoretical basis for achieving free-abrasive, tool-free polishing.|$|E

30|$|With {{the typical}} {{structure}} of a rotor spiral groove, the component is equipped with the function of a grooved cylindrical cam. The curve of the groove {{was designed to be}} a trade–off between a sinusoid and an exponential curve. The left and right sides of the curve intersect, and a curve connection is employed at the reverse location for a transition, forming a closed cycle. As a result, its groove shape is much more complicated than that of a common rotor spiral groove [21]. Therefore, it is of universal significance for the polishing of a rotor spiral groove to verify the <b>groove</b> <b>drum.</b>|$|R
