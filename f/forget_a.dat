40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} <b>an</b> {{approach}} to <b>forgetting</b> in disjunc-tive logic programs, where <b>forgetting</b> <b>an</b> atom from a pro-gram {{amounts to a}} reduction in the signature of that program. Notably, the approach is syntax-independent, so that if two programs are strongly equivalent, then the result of forget-ting a given atom in each program is also strongly equivalent. Our central definition of forgetting is abstract: <b>forgetting</b> <b>an</b> atom from program P is characterised by the set of those SE consequences of P that do not mention the atom to be for-gotten. We provide an equivalent, syntactic, characterization in which <b>forgetting</b> <b>an</b> atom p is given by those rules in the program that do not mention p, together with rules obtained by a single inference step from those rules that do mention p. Forgetting is shown to have appropriate properties; in par-ticular, answer sets are preserved in <b>forgetting</b> <b>an</b> atom. <b>As</b> well, <b>forgetting</b> <b>an</b> atom via the syntactic characterization re-sults in a modest (at worst quadratic) blowup in the program size. Finally, we provide a prototype implementation of this approach to forgetting...|$|R
25|$|The {{circumstance}} of Mr. Rogers having preached at Paul's cross, after Queen Mary {{arrived at}} the Tower, has been already stated. He confirmed in his sermon the true doctrine taught in King Edward's time, and exhorted the people to beware of the pestilence of popery, idolatry, and superstition. For this he was called to account, but so ably defended himself that, for that time, he was dismissed. The proclamation of the queen, however, to prohibit true preaching, gave his enemies a new handle against him. Hence he was again summoned before the council, and commanded to keep to his house. He did so, though he might have escaped; and though he perceived {{the state of the}} true religion to be desperate. He knew he could not want a living in Germany; and he could not <b>forget</b> <b>a</b> wife and ten children, and to seek means to succor them. But all these things were insufficient to induce him to depart, and, when once called to answer in Christ's cause, he stoutly defended it, and hazarded his life for that purpose.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan {{had picked}} a fight shrewdly, as the busmen had no allies amongst the other unions. Ernest Bevin or Arthur Deakin {{would not have}} allowed such a strike, but Cousins felt {{compelled}} to support it, and Opposition leader Hugh Gaitskell criticised the government in a speech at Glasgow. Gaitskell moved a motion of censure over Macleod's treatment of the strike. Macleod had recently demanded more debates on industrial relations but in his Commons speech of 8 May now criticised the opposition for demanding one. He moved the house to laugh at Gaitskell by quoting the line of “Mr Marx, of whom I am a devoted follower – Groucho, not Karl” “Sir, I never <b>forget</b> <b>a</b> face, but I will make an exception for yours”. He {{then moved on to}} a blistering attack on Gaitskell, including the declaration that “I cannot conceal the scorn and contempt for the part that the Leader of the Opposition has played in this.” He was discreetly congratulated afterwards by the Labour frontbencher Alf Robens. Roy Jenkins describes his attack on Gaitskell as “high order jugular debating”, accusing Gaitskell of weak leadership in appeasing the militants of his own party and attacking him for refusing to endorse the findings of the arbitration tribunal.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Out of Mind" [...] is a pop song {{featuring}} synthesizers, guitars, {{bass and}} keys instrumentation. Its lyrics {{speak of the}} singer's inability to completely <b>forget</b> <b>a</b> former boyfriend. Its lyrical content was described by Lo and music critics alike as a sequel to [...] "Habits (Stay High)". The song was well received by some critics, who commended its production and considered {{it one of the}} best tracks from the extended play. However, it attained little commercial success, peaking at number 39 on the Official Finnish Airplay Chart.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to her work for other artists, Lo has co-written the songs from her own record releases.

The track became her first collaboration with co-writers Jakob Jerlström and Ludvig Söderberg, better known as The Struts, and was later released as Lo's debut single in October 2012. [...] "Habits", also co-written with The Struts, was released as the singer's second single in March 2013. It was written during 2012's Hurricane Sandy in New York, and was inspired by Lo's attempts to <b>forget</b> <b>a</b> former boyfriend through substance abuse and other hedonistic practices. Its popularity among music blogs gained the artist a recording contract with Universal Music Group.|$|E

In his 1959 book, George of the Ritz, Criticos remembered some of the notable people and events during his years of service. [...] Criticos once acted as an agent to the Aga Kahn at the racetrack, having been given US$45,000 by the monarch to place bets in his name. [...] He was also asked to take the 18-year-old Prince Aly Khan on a monthlong tour of the United States to help the young man <b>forget</b> <b>a</b> failed romance.

500|$|The grey jay readily capitalizes on {{novel food}} sources, {{including}} {{taking advantage of}} man-made sources of food. To the frustration of trappers using baits to catch fur-bearing animals or early travelers trying to protect their winter food supplies, and {{to the delight of}} campers, bold grey jays are known to approach humans for treats and to steal from unattended food stores. Grey jays do not change their feeding behavior if watched by people; if they are able to link humans with food, they will not <b>forget.</b> <b>A</b> nesting female that had become accustomed to being fed by humans was reportedly able to be enticed to leave the nest during incubation and brooding. This behaviour has inspired a number of nicknames for the grey jay, including [...] "lumberjack", [...] "meat-bird", [...] "venison-hawk", [...] "moose-bird", and [...] "gorby", the last two popular in Maine in the northeastern United States.

500|$|The {{new system}} of {{government}} in Athens opened up a wealth of opportunity for men like Themistocles, who previously {{would have had no}} access to power. Moreover, the new institutions of the democracy required skills that had previously been unimportant in government. Themistocles was to prove himself a master of the new system; [...] "he could infight, he could network, he could spin... and crucially, he knew how to make himself visible." [...] Themistocles moved to the Ceramicus, a down-market part of Athens. This move marked him out as a 'man of the people', and allowed him to interact more easily with ordinary citizens. He began building up a support base among these newly empowered citizens: [...] "he wooed the poor; and they, not used to being courted, duly loved him back. Touring the taverns, the markets, the docks, canvassing where no politician had thought to canvas before, making sure never to <b>forget</b> <b>a</b> single voter's name, Themistocles had set his eyes on a radical new constituency" [...] However, he took care to ensure that he did not alienate the nobility of Athens. He began to practice law, the first person in Athens to prepare for public life in this way. His ability as attorney and arbitrator, used {{in the service of the}} common people, gained him further popularity.|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1953–54, Hutton led the MCC {{on a tour of}} West Indies. Before the team left England, critics queried his appointment, arguing that a {{professional}} captain was unsuitable to lead a tour. Hutton's authority was also compromised by the MCC, who did not give him the tour manager he requested; instead, they appointed the inexperienced Charles Palmer, the Leicestershire captain, who had already been selected as a player on the tour. Palmer's dual role as player and manager blurred the lines of command. Hutton also found some of the professionals in the team to be difficult to lead, particularly Godfrey Evans, and Fred Trueman. Off-field events often overshadowed the cricket. Amid growing independence movements in the region, Hutton believed his team was used as a political instrument to support colonial rule. The situation was further inflamed as journalists and English residents in the Caribbean placed great emphasis on an English victory, and the perception was that the series would establish the unofficial world champions. The standards of local umpiring were a further source of controversy. The crowds often made noisy protests about on-field events, often related to umpiring. The climax came in the third Test when missiles were thrown onto the outfield when the umpire judged Cliff McWatt was out; Hutton kept his team and the umpires on the field, possibly defusing a dangerous situation. The attitude of some English players inflamed feelings, either through a perceived lack of courtesy, or their negative reactions to events on the field. Some critics held Hutton responsible for this, but the editor of Wisden later wrote: [...] " [...] was involved in the most thankless task any cricket captain has undertaken when he went to West Indies. Instead of finding a friendly cricket atmosphere he and his players were subjected to the impact of deep political and racial feeling—an experience all of them wish to <b>forget.</b> <b>A</b> few members of the team did not hide their innermost feelings, with the result that Hutton came under severe criticism, although his behaviour was blameless." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the Dream Pool Essays is {{certainly}} his most extensive and important work, Shen Kuo wrote other books as well. [...] In 1075, Shen Kuo wrote the Xining Fengyuan Li ( [...] ; The Oblatory Epoch astronomical {{system of the}} Splendid Peace reign period), which was lost, but listed in a 7th chapter of a Song Dynasty bibliography. [...] This was the official report of Shen Kuo on his reforms of the Chinese calendar, which were only partially adopted by the Song court's official calendar system. [...] During his years of retirement from governmental service, Shen Kuo compiled a formulary known as the Liang Fang ( [...] ; Good medicinal formulas). Around the year 1126 it was combined with a similar collection by the famous Su Shi (1037–1101), who was ironically a political opponent to Shen Kuo's faction of Reformers and New Policies supporters at court, yet it was known that Shen Kuo and Su Shi were nonetheless friends and associates. Shen wrote the Mengqi Wanghuai Lu ( [...] ; Record of longings forgotten at Dream Brook), which was also compiled during Shen's retirement. [...] This book was a treatise in the working since his youth on rural life and ethnographic accounts of living conditions in the isolated mountain regions of China. [...] Only quotations of it survive in the Shuo Fu (...) collection, which mostly describe the agricultural implements and tools used by rural people in high mountain regions. [...] Shen Kuo also wrote the Changxing Ji ( [...] ; Collected Literary Works of [...] Changxing). [...] However, this book was without much doubt a posthumous collection, including various poems, prose, and administrative documents written by Shen. By the 15th century (during the Ming Dynasty), this book was reprinted, yet only the 19th chapter remained. [...] This chapter was reprinted in 1718, yet poorly edited. [...] Finally, in the 1950s the author Hu Daojing supplemented this small yet valuable work with additions of other scattered poems written by Shen, in the former's Collection of Shen Kua's Extant Poetry (Shanghai: Shang-hai Shu-tian, 1958). In {{the tradition of the}} popular Song era literary category of 'travel record literature' ('youji wenxue'), Shen Kuo also wrote the Register of What Not to <b>Forget,</b> <b>a</b> traveler's guide to what type of carriage is suitable for a journey, the proper foods one should bring, the special clothing one should bring, and many other items.|$|E
