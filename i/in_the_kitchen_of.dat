500|$|The Elliot Lake Standard {{reported}} in 2008 on [...] "greater than normal" [...] leaks causing damages to multiple units. Starlight Cafe closed permanently, despite being profitable soon after opening, as customers would occasionally need umbrellas {{to stand at}} the take-out counter.

(Scotiabank began construction on a new location in July 2011, to replace their mall location.) Some businesses suggested that additional leaks started after the new owner started repairs to the roof. Tenants noticed a reduced amount of traffic after leaks started, and buckets were scattered throughout the mall.|$|E

While Wyatt sipped a drink and smoked a cigar, they tried to tell Earp's story, but Josephine was always present. She often interrupted and insisted, [...] "You can't write that! It needs to be clean." [...] She also demanded that they add more [...] "pep" [...] to the manuscript, which in her mind meant including the word [...] "CRACK!" [...] in all capitals. In the chapter about the shootout, the manuscript includes 109 uses of [...] "CRACK".

500|$|In January or February 1943, Chevalier {{had a brief}} {{conversation}} with Oppenheimer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>of</b> his home. Chevalier told Oppenheimer {{that there was a}} scientist, George Eltenton, who could transmit information of a technical nature to the Soviet Union. Oppenheimer rejected the overture, but failed to report it until August 1943, when he volunteered to Manhattan Project security officers that three men at Berkeley had been solicited for nuclear secrets on behalf of the Soviet Union, by a person he did not know who worked for Shell Oil, and who had Communist connections. He gave that person's name as George Eltenton. When pressed on the issue in later interviews at Los Alamos in December 1943 with Groves, who promised to keep the identity of the three men from the FBI, Oppenheimer identified the contact who had approached him as Chevalier, and told Groves that only one person had been approached: his brother Frank. Groves considered Oppenheimer too important to the ultimate Allied goals of building atomic bombs and winning the war to oust him over this suspicious behavior. He ordered that Oppenheimer be given a security clearance [...] "without delay, irrespective of the information which you have concerning Mr. Oppenheimer. He is absolutely essential to the project." ...|$|E

[...] More than four minutes passed before Smith came back on the air announcing [...] "a disturbing report that Senator Robert Kennedy had been shot". [...] During that four minutes of extended coverage, the studio camera broadcast the live panic and bewilderment in the ABC newsroom. The reporters who had been present to report on Kennedy's win in the primary ended up crowding into the kitchen where he had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no live transmission capability. ABC was able to show scant live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported but unlike CBS and NBC, all of ABC's coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white. CBS and NBC shot footage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>of</b> the shooting's aftermath on color film, which could not be broadcast until it was developed two hours after the incident.|$|E
