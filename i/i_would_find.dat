500|$|The protest {{attracted}} {{different classes}} of people, {{the majority of}} which were peaceful. According to Denham, a popular phrase amongst those protesting was [...] "I never thought that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> myself doing something like this." [...] Stephen Ward, who {{had been involved in}} the original 1970s protest, decided in early 1993 that excessive force was being used against protesters, and started keeping a log of events. He used this log when defending other protesters in court, visited those who had been imprisoned, and offered them bail. He subsequently established a legal precedent of the right for protesters and demonstrators to have a witness while being questioned.|$|E

They used to be right sods for the first few days, until they realised that everything was going to go smoothly and they could get into the routine of recording. ... Then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> time between numerous cups of tea and salad sandwiches and baked beans on toast to listen to the recording in the control room." ...|$|E

500|$|At age 17, {{in a bid}} to {{show people}} he was {{prepared}} for adult roles, he performed onstage in Peter Shaffer's play Equus, which had not been revived since its first run in 1973, at the Gielgud Theatre. Radcliffe took on the lead role as Alan Strang, a stable boy who has an obsession with horses. Advance sales topped £1.7million, and the role generated significant pre-opening media interest, as Radcliffe appeared in a nude scene. Equus opened on 27 February 2007 and ran until 9 June 2007. Radcliffe's performance received positive reviews as critics were impressed by the nuance and depth of his against-type role. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote that he [...] "displays a dramatic power and an electrifying stage presence that marks a tremendous leap forward." [...] He added: [...] "I never thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> the diminutive (but perfectly formed) Radcliffe a sinister figure, but as Alan Strang ... there are moments when he seems genuinely scary in his rage and confusion." [...] The production then transferred to Broadway in September 2008, with Radcliffe still in the lead role. Radcliffe stated he was nervous about repeating the role on Broadway because he considered American audiences more discerning than those in London. Radcliffe's performance was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.|$|E
500|$|... "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{was written}} by Swift and {{produced}} by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. It was inspired by an ex-boyfriend who was later revealed to be opposite of what Swift had originally thought. Swift recalled that, at first, [...] "He came across as prince charming." [...] As the relationship continued, Swift was informed of numerous secrets about her boyfriend she was not aware of. [...] "And one by one, I would figure them out. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> out who he really was," [...] she said. She wrote [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] in an emotional state, which she described as [...] "the breaking point", where she thought to herself, [...] "'You know what? Don’t even {{think that you can}} keep on hurting me.'" [...] The circumstances reached a point where she felt she had to walk away. [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on October 28, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store. The song was reissued on March 5, 2009, as remix, the same day she made her guest appearance on the television series [...] in the episode [...] "Turn, Turn, Turn". The remix was featured in the episode.|$|E
2500|$|Sanger said {{he found}} no {{evidence}} for a God so he became an agnostic. In an interview published in the Times newspaper in 2000 Sanger is quoted as saying: [...] "My father was a committed Quaker and I was brought up as a Quaker, and for them truth is very important. I drifted away from those beliefs – one is obviously looking for truth, but one needs some evidence for it. Even if I wanted to believe in God <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> it very difficult. I would need to see proof." ...|$|E

2500|$|She became {{disenchanted with}} Islam, and {{was shocked by}} the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, for which al-Qaeda {{eventually}} claimed responsibility. After listening to videotapes of Osama bin Laden citing [...] "words of justification" [...] in the Qur'an for the attacks, she wrote, [...] "I picked up the Qur'an and the hadith and started looking through them, to check. I hated to do it, because I knew that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> Bin Laden's quotations in there." [...] During this time of transition, she came to regard the Qur'an as relative – it was a historical record and [...] "just another book." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murtić's {{wife was}} Goranka Vrus Murtić, a {{well-known}} artist {{in her own}} right. Together they bought and renovated an old stone house {{in the town of}} Vrsar, on the Istrian coast. Although their main residence was in Zagreb, they spent much of each year in Vrsar. Of his summer house and studio, Murtić said [...] "It is really nice here, I enjoy the silence and concentration that is irreplaceable... I do not know if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> a more beautiful place anywhere in the world." [...] The landscape there inspired many of his paintings, especially the [...] "Montraker" [...] cycle, which is named for the nearby Ancient Roman stone quarry.|$|E
2500|$|In his 2005 {{autobiography}} Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story, Michaels {{stated that}} it was Triple H's idea, while the sharpshooter spot had been suggested by Hart. [...] "We were talking things through, and Bret {{came up with this}} spot where I get him in the Sharpshooter and then he reverses it by pulling on my leg". Indirectly corroborating this assertion is Hart's own testimony in his autobiography Hitman, that [...] "Pat Patterson told me that {{he thought it would be}} a heckuva spot to let Shawn put me in the Sharpshooter and then reverse it on him," [...] which would indicate that Patterson had initially proposed the [...] "Sharpshooter" [...] spot to Bret. However, in the same work, Hart also states, [...] "I found myself jostling with Jerry Brisco, who <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> out later was the one who had designed the whole Screwjob for Vince." ...|$|E
