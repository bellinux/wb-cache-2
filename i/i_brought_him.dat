500|$|... g. [...] While {{discussing}} {{the introduction of}} taekwondo to Malaysia and Singapore, Ki Ha Rhee noted that Choi had instructed him to bring another instructor with him. Almost certainly referring to C. H. Rhee, he added, [...] "That's why I took the brother of Rhee Chong Chul—from Rhee International—he {{was the first to}} graduate so he came to Malaysia then <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> to Singapore" [...] (p.52).|$|E
500|$|Martin's mother remarked, [...] "Whoever he is now, he's {{the person}} the prison service trained him to be. These bastards {{have no right}} to take my son's life. <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> into the world. I am the only person who can take him out of it." [...] However, no one {{formally}} protested against the hanging. At dawn on 19 April 1996, Martin was hanged in Changi Prison together with two Singaporean drug traffickers. On that day, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Royal Thai Police closed their files on the murders of Sheila and Darin Damude, declaring the case effectively solved.|$|E
500|$|After the race, Espinoza said, [...] "He's OK... Maybe it {{was just}} a little too much for him those three weeks, flying back and forth. He was running pretty {{comfortable}} there, but not like he used to." [...] Baffert was proud of the horse's fighting effort, stating [...] "It was just guts." [...] Though Zayat talked of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "We knew we were doing the impossible, shipping him back and forth." [...] The following day, Baffert said that American Pharoah was healthy and came out of the race in good shape. He said he had no regrets, stating, [...] "I'm glad <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him.</b> Racing needed something like this. He almost pulled it off." [...] Regarding Zayat's talk of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "Mr. Zayat is a very emotional man. We were all pretty disappointed... I know (Zayat) will be going back and forth... He's a sportsman for bringing him up here." [...] Five days later, Zayat announced that the horse would be kept in training with the goal to run in the Breeders' Cup Classic, stating, [...] "I believe there were a combination of factors that prevented American Pharoah from running his absolute best... I have every confidence that he can run to his best again, and he deserves the chance to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Stokes smiled. [...] "That ain't George," [...] he said, gleefully; [...] "That's my friend, Mr. Alfred Bell. Ain't it a {{extraordinary}} likeness? Ain't it wonderful? That's why <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>'im</b> up; <b>I</b> wanted George to see 'im." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Stumps, don't you be cheeky," [...] said Slagg, quietly {{picking up}} his cap and putting it on; [...] "this is a friend o' mine--one o' the electricians,--so you needn't try to shock his feelin's, for he can give better than he gets. He's got no berth yet, so <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>'im</b> here to show him hospitality." ...|$|R
60|$|RUFIO. Ay. <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> with me. He {{is waiting}} there (jerking his thumb over his shoulder) under guard.|$|R
500|$|Frankie {{begins to}} hear their tiny voices calling to her and, though World tries to {{distract}} her from it, she finally discovers her friends. World finally becomes upset and scolds Frankie of planning to leave him alone in the toy box forever. She calms him down enough to befriend and unshrink the gang, but Mr. Herriman bursts in, having gotten into the toy box and somehow past the gang's obstacles, and harshly scolds World before preparing to take the gang home and leave World. World's world falls to pieces until it's nothing but a white void. World becomes angry and unstable and turns into a chimera-like creature to attack them all (made of the remaining refuse of his world). The gang manages to escape the toy box. Frankie climbs out as well and tries to convince everyone to let World out of the box. Herriman finally yields and releases World from the box, due to a realization of his long misjudgement of Frankie and newfound appreciation for her during her absence. World gets happy already and shouts that he's free and everyone is really confused, Frankie's answer is: [...] "Well, {{think of it this}} way: Imagine if you were able to have anything you wanted, except one thing, but that one thing is what you wanted more than anything else. For him, that thing is a friend. That's all he wanted; that's {{what he was trying to}} protect. So <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> here. Here he can have all the friends in the world! I mean come on, isn't friendship what Foster's is all about?" [...] Instantaneously Bloo shouts, [...] " [...] No, it's all about me!" [...] promptly Herriman slaps him with a glove, to the delight of everyone else.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{ends with}} the song [...] "North Star," [...] {{which serves as a}} [...] "closing credits" [...] type of song. In regard to this track and Popa Wu's inclusion, RZA later remarked [...] "The idea is Rae did {{everything}} he had to do. Everything is over now. The job is over. Mission is over, it's a perfect closing to the album. Popa Wu was a very smart mentor in the younger days to me and ODB. Everybody had dibs and dabs of knowledge of self, <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> in to be a mentor to these men like, 'I love them and you the only person I know that have the intelligence to keep them in sync with knowledge.' It's very poisonous unless they got proper guidance. He was the smartest man I'd ever met at a certain time in my life." [...] Raekwon further commented [...] "'North Star' was a track I really, really wanted on my album. It was a track that I felt a vibe of it was motion picture-like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on," [...] Harding roared. [...] "Keep your shirts on. That man {{belongs to}} me. I caught him an' <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> here. D'ye think <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> {{all the way}} here to be lynched? Not on your life. I could 'a' done that myself when I found him. <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> here for a fair an' {{impartial}} trial, an' by God, a fair an' impartial trial he's goin' to get. He's tied up safe an' sound. Chuck him in a bunk till morning, an' we'll hold the trial right here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a horrid sell!" [...] Tom Jackson exclaimed angrily. [...] "I can't {{understand}} his going like that after <b>I</b> fairly <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> down." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Then I {{reached the}} Great Green (wSd-wr). Then I made the ships and I {{dispatched}} them with {{all manner of}} things and made for them a great oblation of cattle, oxen and gazelles. When I returned from the Great Green, I performed what His Majesty commanded: <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> for <b>him</b> every product that I found {{on the shores of}} God's Land. I descended by WSg (unidentified) (and) Ro-Henu (Wadi Hammamat). <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> for <b>him</b> splendid blocks of stone for the temple statues." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Save him, save him!' she exclaimed. 'Oh! you cannot save <b>him!</b> And <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> to this! Ferdinand! dearest Ferdinand! oh! I shall die!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There need be no scruples on that score,' said Albinia; 'the Colonel {{would only}} thank me if <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> half Bayford.' ...|$|E
60|$|So he {{was running}} on, for he himself had drunk more than his share, when <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> back to my matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{a friend}} of yours asking for you, Andrew; <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> up," [...] he explained, and stood aside as Frobisher entered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle," [...] she said, [...] "I met Guy {{coming away}} from Coniston Mansions. He {{was looking for}} me, and <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> to see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> {{a little}} book to read, which will do him good. It is called 'Elementary Rules for the Preservation of the Body'." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{stood with}} Otto in the meadow. <b>I</b> had <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> the watch, and I {{gave it to}} him, and all my love and my life with it.|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE (ignoring him). I'm overwhelmed, Miss Clandon. It's all my fault: <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> here: I'm {{responsible}} for him. And I'm ashamed of him.|$|E
6000|$|... “No, it was {{not from}} affection, {{it was for the}} love of you that <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> here. That {{imbecile}} H. was going to send him to Tolosa.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was well}} turned, friend Armand," [...] he said lightly; [...] "but I assure you, mademoiselle, that before <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> here to-night his ideal was a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Papa! a {{surprise}} for you!" [...] said Miss Milroy, rousing him from his occupation. [...] "Mr. Armadale has come to Thorpe Ambrose; and <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> here to see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was not <b>I</b> who <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> here," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{was against}} it always. The trouble is of your making--and his. He drank with {{me from the}} King's cup." ...|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> it to <b>him,</b> {{he seized}} it greedily and drank it out.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I told Mr Headstone {{you were}} not settled, Liz, {{but he was so}} kind as to take an {{interest}} in coming, and so <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him.</b> How well you look!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I met the Colonel, Belle," [...] said Mr. Quest, [...] "coming {{here with}} the benevolent {{intention}} of giving you some snipe, so <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> up by the short way." ...|$|E
60|$|In an {{hour and}} a half the colonel leaned back. <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> a pony of brandy and his black coffee, and set the box of Havana regalias on the table.|$|E
6000|$|My mother {{drank the}} water and spoke. [...] "That boy," [...] she said, [...] "takes after his father. He grows more like him every day.... And so <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{would have}} died if <b>I</b> hadn't <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> food," [...] she muttered. [...] "I have wept all the tears a woman's broken heart could wring out, beseeching {{him to come back}} to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, Uncle Horace," [...] {{answered}} Leo; for <b>I</b> had <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> up {{to call me}} uncle--though he varied the appellation somewhat disrespectfully {{by calling}} me [...] "old fellow," [...] or even [...] "my avuncular relative." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd like {{to shoot}} that owl," [...] he told himself, as the hooting continued. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> down I could have him stuffed," [...] he thought, with some satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you mistake {{my husband}} altogether!" [...] cried Mrs. Archibald. [...] "The trouble {{with him is}} that he has too much spirit, and that is the reason <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He's not a nasty brute, mother. He's my dog, and his name's Fido. John {{ran over}} {{him in the}} car, and <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> home to live with us. I love him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{went down}} to Wrapworth and found him very unwell, quite out of order, and {{neglecting}} himself,' said the captain; 'so <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> up for advice, as I could not make him hear reason.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whose is it, then, gal?" [...] {{demanded the}} deacon, sharply. [...] "Gar'ner had some such silly notion {{in his head}} when I first told him of this treasure; but <b>I</b> soon <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> to hear reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} speak. The thought that <b>I</b> had <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> to this {{in spite of}} his desire to be friendly, {{overwhelmed}} me. I could only seize his hand, bury my face in the bed-clothes, and sob.|$|R
