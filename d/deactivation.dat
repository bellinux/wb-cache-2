40|$|The {{needling}} {{sensation of}} deqi {{is considered by}} most acupuncturists {{to be an important}} component of acupuncture, yet neuroimaging research that investigates this needle sensation has been limited. In this study we have investigated the effect of deqi and acute pain needling sensations upon brain fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Seventeen right-handed participants who received acupuncture at the right LI- 4 (Hegu) acupoint were imaged in a 3 T MRI scanner. fMRI datasets were classified, on the basis of psychophysical participants' reports of needling scores, into those that were associated with predominantly deqi sensations versus those with predominantly acute pain sensations. Brain areas showing changes in BOLD signal increases (activations) and decreases (<b>deactivations)</b> were identified. Differences were demonstrated in the pattern of activations and <b>deactivations</b> between groupings of scans associated with deqi versus pain sensations. For the deqi grouping, significant <b>deactivations</b> occurred, whereas significant activations did not. In contrast, the predominantly acute pain grouping was associated with a mixture of activations and <b>deactivations.</b> For the comparison between the predominately deqi sensation grouping and the acute pain sensation grouping (deqi>pain contrast), only negative Z value voxels resulted (mainly from <b>deactivations</b> in the deqi grouping and activations in the pain grouping) in the limbic/sub-cortical structures and the cerebellum regions of interest.

40|$|A {{consistent}} finding from functional neuroimaging {{studies of}} cognitive aging is an age-related reduction in occipital activity coupled with increased frontal activity. This posterior [...] anterior shift in aging (PASA) has been typically attributed to functional compensation. The present functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} sought to 1) confirm that PASA reflects the effects of aging rather than differences in task difficulty; 2) test the compensation hypothesis; and 3) investigate whether PASA generalizes to <b>deactivations.</b> Young and older participants were scanned during episodic retrieval and visual perceptual tasks, and age-related changes in brain activity common to both tasks were identified. The study yielded 3 main findings. First, inconsistent with a difficulty account, the PASA pattern was found across task and confidence levels when matching performance among groups. Second, supporting the compensatory hypothesis, age-related increases in frontal activity were positively correlated with performance and negatively correlated with the age-related occipital decreases. Age-related increases and correlations with parietal activity were also found. Finally, supporting the generalizability of the PASA pattern to <b>deactivations,</b> aging reduced <b>deactivations</b> in posterior midline cortex but increased <b>deactivations</b> in medial frontal cortex. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the validity, function, and generalizability of PASA, as well as its importance for the cognitive neuroscience of aging...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The posteromedial cortex (PMC) and medial {{prefrontal cortex}} (mPFC) {{are part of}} a network of brain regions that has been found to exhibit {{decreased}} activity during goal-oriented tasks. This network is thought to support a baseline of brain activity, and is commonly referred to as the "default network". Although recent reports suggest that the PMC and mPFC are associated with affective, social, and self-referential processes, the relationship between these default network components and personality traits, especially those pertaining to social context, is poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the current investigation, we assessed the relationship between PMC and mPFC <b>deactivations</b> and psychopathic personality traits using fMRI and a self-report measure. We found that PMC <b>deactivations</b> predicted traits related to egocentricity and mPFC <b>deactivations</b> predicted traits related to decision-making. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that the PMC and mPFC are associated with processes involving self-relevancy and affective decision-making, consistent with previous reports. More generally, these findings suggest a link between default network activity and personality traits...|$|R

5|$|Chester Rock Light was a {{light in}} Chester, Connecticut on the Connecticut River. It was built in 1889 {{as part of a}} $15,000 {{appropriation}} by the United States Congress. The 21-foot (6.4 meter) tall wooden hexagonal pyramidal tower had a black lantern with a 6th order Fresnel lens. The light was first lit on July 1, 1889. The tower was replaced in 1912 by a skeleton tower that was subsequently modified in 1927. Records do not show the <b>deactivation</b> or destruction of the light, but it was believed to have been removed in the 1930s. In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut wanted to build a replica of the structure for use as a daymark.|$|E

40|$|Using {{electroencephalography}} (EEG) {{in combination}} with {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), we studied a 9. 5 -year-old girl who developed cognitive and behavioral regression in association with intense interictal bilaterally synchronous epileptic discharges (IBSEDs) both during the awake state and during sleep. During runs of IBSEDs, EEG-fMRI demonstrated <b>deactivations</b> in the lateral and medial frontoparietal cortices, posterior cingulate gyrus, and cerebellum together with focal relative activations in the right frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. The <b>deactivations</b> probably reflect the repercussion of the interictal epileptic activity on normal brain function which might cause the neuropsychological regression by inducing repetitive interruptions of neurophysiological function resulting in a chronic state of specific psychomotor impairment. The relative activations could possibly indicate the source of epileptic activity rapidly spreading to other brain regions. Case ReportsJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|The "default system" of {{the brain}} has been {{described}} as a set of regions which are 'activated' during rest and 'deactivated' during cognitively effortful tasks. To investigate the reliability of task-related <b>deactivations,</b> we performed a meta-analysis across 12 fMRI studies. Our results replicate previous findings by implicating medial frontal and parietal brain regions as part of the "default system". However, the cognitive correlates of these <b>deactivations</b> remain unclear. In light of the importance of social cognitive abilities for human beings and their propensity to engage in such activities, we relate our results to findings from neuroimaging studies of social cognition. This demonstrates a remarkable overlap between the brain regions typically involved in social cognitive processes and the "default system". We, henceforth, suggest that the physiological 'baseline' {{of the brain}} is intimately linked to a psychological 'baseline': human beings have a predisposition for social cognition as the default mode of cognizing which is implemented in the robust pattern of intrinsic brain activity known as the "default system"...|$|R
50|$|Some {{games are}} played with reloads enabled, {{which means that}} the number of shots a player can fire, or the number of times a player can be deactivated, is limited by a power level the player has. Each player has a certain amount of power for their pack, which is used up slowly by {{shooting}} and used up more quickly by being deactivated. Once that power is used up, in order to resume play the player must go to a reload bay, which are walk-in areas around the arena which will resupply the player with power. The actual device that reloads the packs is a green, flashing device on the wall or roof of the reload bay. Shots and <b>deactivations</b> use up the same supply of energy, so if a player is continually deactivated, they will not only have a lower number of <b>deactivations</b> left until they must reload, they will also have a lower number of shots to use. After a player reloads there is a short delay before they are reactivated.|$|R

40|$|Epileptic {{encephalopathy}} with continuous spikes {{and waves}} during slow sleep is an age-related disorder {{characterized by the}} presence of interictal epileptiform discharges during at least > 85 % of sleep and cognitive deficits associated with this electroencephalography pattern. The pathophysiological mechanisms of continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep and neuropsychological deficits associated with this condition are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the haemodynamic changes associated with epileptic activity using simultaneous acquisitions of electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging in 12 children with symptomatic and cryptogenic continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep. We compared the results of magnetic resonance to electric source analysis carried out using a distributed linear inverse solution at two time points of the averaged epileptic spike. All patients demonstrated highly significant spike-related positive (activations) and negative (<b>deactivations)</b> blood oxygenation-level-dependent changes (P < 0. 05, family-wise error corrected). The activations involved bilateral perisylvian region and cingulate gyrus in all cases, bilateral frontal cortex in five, bilateral parietal cortex in one and thalamus in five cases. Electrical source analysis demonstrated a similar involvement of the perisylvian brain regions in all patients, independent of the area of spike generation. The spike-related <b>deactivations</b> were found in structures of the default mode network (precuneus, parietal cortex and medial frontal cortex) in all patients and in caudate nucleus in four. Group analyses emphasized the described individual differences. Despite aetiological heterogeneity, patients with continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep were characterized by activation of the similar neuronal network: perisylvian region, insula and cingulate gyrus. Comparison with the electrical source analysis results suggests that the activations correspond to both initiation and propagation pathways. The <b>deactivations</b> in structures of the default mode network are consistent with the concept of epileptiform activity impacting on normal brain function by inducing repetitive interruptions of neurophysiological function...|$|R
40|$|Much {{research}} has been done on studying the diffusion of ideas or technologies on social networks including the Influence Maximization problem and many of its variations. Here, we investigate a type of inverse problem. Given a snapshot of the diffusion process, we seek to understand if the snapshot is feasible for a given dynamic, i. e., whether there is a limited number of nodes whose initial adoption can result in the snapshot in finite time. While similar questions have been considered for epidemic dynamics, here, we consider this problem for variations of the deterministic Linear Threshold Model, which is more appropriate for modeling strategic agents. Specifically, we consider both sequential and simultaneous dynamics when <b>deactivations</b> are allowed and when they are not. Even though we show hardness results for all variations we consider, we show that the case of sequential dynamics with <b>deactivations</b> allowed is significantly harder than all others. In contrast, sequential dynamics make the problem trivial on cliques even though it's complexity for simultaneous dynamics is unknown. We complement our hardness results with structural insights that can help better understand diffusions of social networks under various dynamics. Comment: 14 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Berman et al. 2 To explore sex {{differences}} in the response of seven brain regions to an aversive pelvic visceral stimulus, fMRI images were acquired from 13 healthy adults (6 women) during 15 s of cued rectal distension at two pressures: 25 mmHg (uncomfortable), and 45 mmHg (mild pain), as well as during an expectation condition (no distension). Random effects analyses combining subject data voxelwise found 45 mmHg pressure significantly activated the insular and anterior cingulate cortices in both sexes. In men only, the left thalamus and ventral striatum were also activated. Although all activations appeared more extensive in men, no sex difference attained significance. To explore the presence of <b>deactivations,</b> which are generally cancelled by more numerous activations when subjects are combined for each voxel, the number of activated voxels, number of deactivated voxels, and ratio of deactivated voxels to total voxels affected were assessed via random effects mixed model analyses combining subject data at the region level.

5|$|Depending on the {{organism}} and experimental system, the exogenous RNA {{may be a}} long strand designed to be cleaved by dicer, or short RNAs designed to serve as siRNA substrates.

Mouse oocytes and cells from early mouse embryos lack this reaction to exogenous dsRNA {{and are therefore a}} common model system for studying mammalian gene-knockdown effects. Specialized laboratory techniques have also been developed to improve the utility of RNAi in mammalian systems by avoiding the direct introduction of siRNA, for example, by stable transfection with a plasmid encoding the appropriate sequence from which siRNAs can be transcribed, or by more elaborate lentiviral vector systems allowing the inducible activation or <b>deactivation</b> of transcription, known as conditional RNAi.|$|E

5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and <b>deactivation.</b> Renaturation of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E
40|$|There {{are defined}} medullary, mesencephalic, hypothalamic, and thalamic {{functions}} in regulation of respiration, but knowledge of cortical {{control and the}} elements subserving the consciousness of breathlessness and air hunger is limited. In nine young adults, air hunger was produced acutely by CO 2 inhalation. Comparisons were made with inhalation of a N 2 /O 2 gas mixture with the same apparatus, and also with paced breathing, and with eyes closed rest. A network of activations in pons, midbrain (mesencephalic tegmentum, parabrachial nucleus, and periaqueductal gray), hypothalamus, limbic and paralimbic areas (amygdala and periamygdalar region) cingulate, parahippocampal and fusiform gyrus, and anterior insula were seen along with caudate nuclei and pulvinar activations. Strong <b>deactivations</b> were seen in dorsal cingulate, posterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex. The striking response of limbic and paralimbic regions points to these structures having a singular role in the affective sequelae entrained by disturbance of basic respiratory control whereby a process {{of which we are}} normally unaware becomes a salient element of consciousness.

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that multisensory interactions emerge already at the primary cortical level. Specifically, auditory inputs were shown to suppress activations in visual cortices when presented alone but amplify the blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) responses to concurrent visual inputs (and vice versa). This concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation–functional magnetic resonance imaging (TMS-fMRI) study applied repetitive TMS trains at no, low, and high intensity over right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and vertex to investigate top-down influences on visual and auditory cortices under 3 sensory contexts: visual, auditory, and no stimulation. IPS-TMS increased activations in auditory cortices irrespective of sensory context {{as a result of}} direct and nonspecific auditory TMS side effects. In contrast, IPS-TMS modulated activations in the visual cortex in a state-dependent fashion: it deactivated the visual cortex under no and auditory stimulation but amplified the BOLD response to visual stimulation. However, only the response amplification to visual stimulation was selective for IPS-TMS, while the <b>deactivations</b> observed for IPS- and Vertex-TMS resulted from crossmodal <b>deactivations</b> induced by auditory activity to TMS sounds. TMS to IPS may increase the responses in visual (or auditory) cortices to visual (or auditory) stimulation via a gain control mechanism or crossmodal interactions.
