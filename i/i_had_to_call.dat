500|$|... "Bossy" [...] {{was written}} by Shaffer Smith, known by his stage name Ne-Yo, while {{additional}} writing and song production was done by Stargate members Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen. In the beginning of May 2008, a clip of the song leaked on YouTube. As a result, Universal Motown released the full song to media outlets on May 7, 2008. In an interview with Billboard, Ne-Yo revealed that he was approached by the label to write a song for Lohan: [...] "I gotta admit, we were like ... Lindsay Lohan?' I mean, I've written for Beyoncé, Mary J. Blige, Rihanna, Celine Dion and ... Lindsay Lohan? But I will say this; we gave her a quality record and she did a ridiculously fabulous job. I was so shocked <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> her and apologize for what I was thinking because she did so good. I think the world is gonna be surprised." [...] In an interview with People Magazine, he revealed the song [...] "it's basically about a woman being strong enough to get what she wants when she wants it. In this case, 'Bossy' is a term that describes confidence and power." [...] "Bossy" [...] was digitally released on May 27, 2008, and it was set to appear on Lohan's third studio album.|$|E

[...] "There was actually a she {{used to work at}} a bank that I banked at when I was, like, 20 years old. When I moved to Los Angeles, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> her once, about my balance. She said, 'Hel-lo, Miss Ullman! How's Hollywood? 'I said, 'Have you ever been here, Kay?'

[...] "I made a vow that night that if ever again <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> {{in any one}} to help me in {{business}} of that kind I wouldn't go pards with him. I'd pay him {{so much for the}} job, and I'd take the risks, and I've stuck to it.|$|E

"I {{hope you}} won't think it a liberty," [...] Jacob said simply, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> at Tate's {{to get one}} of mine which I'd had restrung, and I saw such a delightfully {{balanced}} lady's racquet that I ventured to bring it down. I thought you might play with it, at any rate, if you didn't feel like doing me the honour of accepting it." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{voice had}} an accent of forced bravery {{in it and}} I was ashamed of my paltry stratagem. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the name again before Mahony saw me and hallooed in answer.

5000|$|In October 2015, Tarantino {{attended}} a Black Lives Matter rally and publicly commented on police brutality in the United States, saying, [...] "When I see murders, I do not stand by... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> a murder a murder, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the murderers the murderers." [...] Tarantino's comments received national media attention, and several police {{groups in the}} United States pledged to boycott The Hateful Eight and his other films. Police groups also encouraged members to not work at the premiere or provide security for any events surrounding the film. In an interview with Los Angeles Times, Tarantino {{said he is not}} a [...] "cop hater" [...] and will not be intimidated by the calls for a boycott.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] laughed the Duke good-naturedly, [...] "have {{you done}} enough mischief? [...] . . . Get ye gone, all of you!--or shall <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> {{the guard and}} have you all whipped {{for a set of}} dastardly cowards, eh? [...] . . .

"I {{struck a}} slave girl {{who stood in}} my way," [...] the captain said, [...] "and he came at me so {{suddenly}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> upon the men to bind him. He threw one of them overboard, and with his naked hands knocked down two others; and, as I have told you, it took all the efforts of eight or ten more before they could overcome him." ...|$|E
60|$|I've often {{wondered}} since then how these murderer fellows manage {{to keep in}} shape while they're contemplating their next effort. I had a much simpler sort of job on hand, {{and the thought of}} it rattled me to such an extent in the night watches that I was a perfect wreck next day. Dark circles under the eyes--I give you my word! <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on Jeeves to rally round with one of those life-savers of his.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact, I have Winthrop's {{permission}} to tell his friends anything they desire to learn, and he mentioned you and Mr. Thorne particularly. To begin with, I must excuse myself for the delay, but I {{found it necessary to}} go on to the railroad to meet Sergeant Williamson, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> at Mrs. Calvert's. To proceed, after considering Winthrop's mortgage deed, it's my opinion that if he can substantiate his statements he has no cause for serious anxiety about the result in the event of his being brought to trial." ...|$|E

[...] Tarantino's comments received national media attention and several police {{groups in the}} United States pledged to boycott The Hateful Eight and his other films. New York City Police Benevolent Association president Patrick J. Lynch said: [...] "With nearly one million law enforcement officers {{in this country who}} have families and friends who support them, the impact that police have economically on a product or project is immense. The law enforcement boycott of cop-hater Quentin Tarantino's movie is one demonstration of that economic power." [...] Tarantino responded that he was not a [...] "cop hater" [...] and would not be intimidated by the calls for a boycott.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Lyons," [...] said I, as I {{rose from}} this long and {{inconclusive}} interview, [...] "you {{are taking a}} very great responsibility and putting yourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean breast of all that you know. If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> in {{the aid of the}} police you will find how seriously you are compromised. If your position is innocent, why did you in the first instance deny <b>having</b> written <b>to</b> Sir Charles upon that date?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was bound}} towards Bennoch's; {{for he had}} written a note to {{apologize}} for not visiting us, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> promised <b>to</b> <b>call</b> and see him to-day.|$|R
60|$|Finally it {{occurred}} to me that I would call as though nothing had happened, and send a message in by the maid asking Mrs. Strickland if it was convenient for her to see me. This would give her the opportunity to send me away. But I was overwhelmed with embarrassment when I said to the maid the phrase I had prepared, and while I waited for the answer in a dark passage <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> up all my strength of mind not to bolt. The maid came back. Her manner suggested to my excited fancy a complete knowledge of the domestic calamity.|$|E
6000|$|So {{presently}} we {{came back}} home, and I spent many busy days in fixing and arranging our new house. I had the drawing-room done in blue, and the dining-room all in dark panelled wood, and a boudoir upstairs done in pink and white enamel to match my bedroom and dressing-room. There {{was a very nice}} little room in the basement next to the coal cellar that I turned into a [...] "den" [...] for John, so that when he wanted to smoke he could go down there and do it. John seemed to appreciate his den at once, and often would stay down there so long that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> to him to come up.|$|E
60|$|I {{attempted}} {{to persuade him}} of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for my master's assistance in coaxing him out of bed. The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy would visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way. The pure heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of Minny, relieved his despondency after a while. He began to put questions concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater interest and liveliness.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not too}} late. It beats, though but feebly. All {{our work}} is undone. We must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on you {{yourself}} this time, friend John." [...] As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag, and producing the instruments of transfusion. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt sleeve. There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so, without a moment's delay, we began the operation.|$|R
60|$|THE ARCHBISHOP. I claim nothing. As <b>I</b> <b>have</b> by {{this time}} perhaps three or four million cousins of one degree or another, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ceased <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on the family.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of his death, rumours had been {{circulating}} online that he had already been killed. Just hours before he was shot, Vega was interviewed for an article on entertainment website La Oreja, in which he confirmed he was still alive. [...] "It's happened to me for years now, someone tells a radio station or a newspaper I've been killed, or suffered an accident," [...] Vega told the website. [...] "And then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> my dear mom, who <b>has</b> heart trouble, <b>to</b> reassure her," [...] he explained.|$|R
60|$|February 8.--I {{lost much}} time to-day. I {{got from the}} Court about half-past twelve, {{therefore}} might have reckoned on four hours, or three at least, before dinner. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on Dr. Shortt at two, which made me lounge till that hour came. Then I missed him, and, too tired to return, {{went to see the}} exhibition, where Skene was hanging up the pictures, and would not let me in. Then to the Oil Gas Company, who propose to send up counsel to support their new bill. As I thought the choice unadvisedly made, I fairly opposed the mission, which, I suppose, will give much offence; but I have no notion of being shamefaced in doing my duty, and I do not think I should permit forward persons to press into situations for which their vanity alone renders them competent. Had many proof-sheets to correct in the evening.|$|E
6000|$|Bayham's story told, I {{entered the}} room, {{over which the}} {{twilight}} was falling, and saw the figures of Clive and Ethel seated {{at each end of}} the bed. The poor old man within it was calling incoherent sentences. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Clive from the present grief before him, with intelligence of further sickness awaiting him at home. Our poor patient did not heed what I said to his son. [...] "You must go home to Rosa," [...] Ethel said. [...] "She will be sure to ask for her husband, and forgiveness is best, dear Clive. I will stay with uncle. I will never leave him. Please God, he will be better in the morning when you come back." [...] So Clive's duty called him to his own sad home; and, the bearer of dismal tidings, I returned to mine. The fires were lit there and the table spread; and kind hearts were waiting to welcome the friend who never more was to enter my door.|$|E
60|$|In a trice {{there was}} a chicken, a bottle, a set of knives and forks, a white cloth, and a hungry oaf that did eat and swear! One bottle {{followed}} another. By the third Mr. Jones embraced me, saying that never had a man been more belied than I; that it was Lord Fellamar, not I, was the villain. To this effect I own that I did myself drop a hint; conceiving that the divine Sophia must often have regretted our friend Fellamar when once she was bound to the oaf, and that Jones was capable of a resentful jealousy. By midnight <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> a chair for my besotted challenger, and when the Avenger was there safely bestowed, I asked him where the men should carry him? His tongue being now thick, and his brains bemused, {{he could not find}} the sign of his inn in his noddle. So, the merry devil prompting me, I gave the men the address of his ancient flame, my Lady Bellaston, and off they jogged with Jones.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} much she enjoyed it, {{but it was an}} immense {{pleasure}} to me; so great a one that, as you see, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> <b>call</b> upon her again." ...|$|R
50|$|In morphology, {{the future}} tense of imperfective verbs was fixed. The type budu volati (I will <b>call)</b> became {{preferred}} <b>to</b> other types (chc’u volati, I want <b>to</b> <b>call,</b> jmám volati, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call,</b> and budu volal, <b>I</b> will <b>have</b> called). The contrastive feature of (im)perfectiveness was also stabilized. The perfectivization function of prefixes and the imperfectivization function of suffixes are applied. As {{a consequence of}} this, aorist and imperfect are disappearing little by little and are replaced by the perfect (now called preterite, since it became the only past tense in Czech). The periphrastic passive voice is formed.|$|R
50|$|TRANSLATION: One {{month to}} the day after the capture of Bắc Ninh you have entered the citadel of Hong-Hoa. This is a new and splendid victory for which the Republic thanks you. If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been {{fortunate}} enough <b>to</b> <b>have</b> spared your blood, you have repaid me by giving lavishly of your energy on the many occasions <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> upon it. <b>I</b> am happy to say that you have not only added a fair province to our possessions but have once again shown that France has vigorous soldiers animated by the purest kind of patriotism.|$|R
6000|$|... '"We {{were passing}} {{to the north}} of the Hector Bank that voyage. I said, 'All right, sir,' {{wondering}} what he was fussing about, since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him before altering the course anyhow. Just then eight bells were struck: we came out on the bridge, and the second mate before going off mentions in the usual way--'Seventy-one on the log.' Captain Brierly looks at the compass and then all round. It was dark and clear, and all the stars were out as plain as on a frosty night in high latitudes. Suddenly he says with a sort of a little sigh: 'I am going aft, and shall set the log at zero for you myself, so that there can be no mistake. Thirty-two miles more on this course and then you are safe. Let's see--the correction on the log is six per cent. additive; say, then, thirty by the dial to run, and you may come twenty degrees to starboard at once. No use losing any distance--is there?' I had never heard him talk so much at a stretch, and to no purpose as it seemed to me. I said nothing. He went down the ladder, and the dog, that was always at his heels whenever he moved, night or day, followed, sliding nose first, after him. I heard his boot-heels tap, tap on the after-deck, then he stopped and spoke to the dog--'Go back, Rover. On the bridge, boy! Go on--get.' Then he calls out to me from the dark, 'Shut that dog up in the chart-room, Mr. Jones--will you?' ...|$|E

'I {{slept on}} board 29th September having {{arranged}} everything {{to start by}} daybreak from where we lay in the roads: but at daybreak a heavy mist hung over us so that nothing of land or water could be seen. At midday it lifted suddenly and away we went with perfect weather, but {{could not find the}} buoys Forde left, that evening. I saw the captain was not strong in navigation, and took matters next day much more into my own hands and before nine o'clock found the buoys; (the weather had been so fine we had anchored in the open sea near Texel). It took us till the evening to reach the buoys, get the cable on board, test the first half, speak to Lowestoft, make the splice, and start. H- had not finished his work at Norderney, so I was alone on board for Reuter. Moreover the buoys to guide us in our course were not placed, and the captain had very vague ideas about keeping his course; so I had to do a good deal, and only lay down as I was for two hours in the night. I managed to run the course perfectly. Everything went well, and we found Norderney just where we wanted it next afternoon, and if the shore end had been laid, could have finished there and then, October 1st. [...] But when we got to Norderney, we found the CAROLINE with shore end lying apparently aground, and could not understand her signals; so we had to anchor suddenly and I went off in a small boat with the captain to the CAROLINE. It was cold by this time, and my arm was rather stiff and I was tired; I hauled myself up on board the CAROLINE by a rope and found H- and two men on board. All the rest were trying to get the shore end on shore, but had failed and apparently had stuck on shore, and the waves were getting up. We had anchored in the right place and next morning we hoped the shore end would be laid, so we had only to go back. It was of course still colder and quite night. I went to bed and hoped to sleep, but, alas, the rheumatism got into the joints and caused me terrible pain so that I could not sleep. I bore it as long as I could in order to disturb no one, for all were tired; but at last I could bear it no longer and managed to wake the steward and got a mustard poultice which took the pain from the shoulder; but then the elbow got very bad, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the second steward and get a second poultice, and then it was daylight, and I felt very ill and feverish. The sea was now rather rough - too rough rather for small boats, but luckily a sort of thing called a scoot came out, and we got on board her with some trouble, and got on shore after a good tossing about which made us all sea-sick. The cable sent from the CAROLINE was just 60 yards too short and did not reach the shore, so although the CAROLINE did make the splice late that night, we could neither test nor speak. Reuter was at Norderney, and I had to do the best I could, which was not much, and went to bed early; I thought I should never sleep again, but in sheer desperation got {{up in the middle of}} the night and gulped a lot of raw whiskey and slept at last. But not long. A Mr. F- washed my face and hands and dressed me: and we hauled the cable out of the sea, and got it joined to the telegraph station, and on October 3rd telegraphed to Lowestoft first and then to London. [...] Miss Clara Volkman, a niece of Mr. Reuter's, sent the first message to Mrs. Reuter, who was waiting (Varley used Miss Clara's hand as a kind of key), and I sent one of the first messages to Odden. I thought a message addressed to him would not frighten you, and that he would enjoy a message through Papa's cable. I hope he did.
