40|$|Hawthorn trees grow {{throughout}} North America {{and they}} produce a small fruit which is eaten {{by a small}} fly larva. In 1864, apple growers discovered an unknown maggot had started feeding on apples. Through the years, hawthorn and apple <b>maggot</b> <b>flies</b> have progressively become more distinct. Below I present evidence taken from the original scientific literature for you to consider and evaluate. From what may be incomplete and ambiguous data, I hope {{you will be able}} to answer what appear to be two simple questions: 1. Do hawthorn <b>maggot</b> <b>flies</b> and apple <b>maggot</b> <b>flies</b> belong to the same species? 2. If not, and if apple <b>maggot</b> <b>flies</b> belong to their own species, what would be a biologically reasonable scenario for how the speciation occurred?

40|$|Terrestrial {{hermit crabs}} (Coenobita spp.) were {{observed}} feeding {{on a variety}} of food items corresponding with observations on the genus worldwide. A field experiment was conducted which examined (1) the feeding activity of Coenobita in two habitats and (2) their potential impact on the removal of carrion and on the colonization of carrion by <b>fly</b> <b>maggots.</b> Habitat and time of day influenced the size and species of Coenobita feeding. Large C. perlatus fed only at night and had the greatest impact on the carrion. Although small Coenobita had little effect on the carrion, their feeding activity did reduce the number of <b>fly</b> <b>maggots</b> in the carrion. The scavenging activity of hermit crabs may serve a useful role on inhabited islets. The rapid removal of carrion would reduce potential fly breeding sites...|$|R
50|$|In {{early summer}} it emerges from pupae {{in the ground}} and seeks out forest tent {{caterpillar}} cocoons, where it deposits live larvae which bore into the cocoons and feed on the pupating insects, killing them. Eventually the <b>fly</b> <b>maggots</b> drop to the ground and pupate and go dormant over the winter.|$|R

40|$|Control and {{background}} of house flies are discussed here. Description The adult house fly is dull gray, 1 / 4 inch long, with four distinct stripes behind the head. The abdomen is pale.

2500|$|Redi {{continued}} his experiments by capturing the maggots {{and waiting for}} them to metamorphose, which they did, becoming flies. [...] Also, when dead <b>flies</b> or <b>maggots</b> were put in sealed jars with dead animals or veal, no maggots appeared, but when the same thing was done with living <b>flies,</b> <b>maggots</b> did. Knowing full well the fates of outspoken thinkers such as Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei, Redi was careful to express his new views in a manner that would not contradict theological tradition of the Church; hence, his interpretations were always based on biblical passages, such as his famous adage: omne vivum ex vivo [...] ("All life comes from life").|$|R
2500|$|As {{the body}} begins to decompose, a {{compilation}} of fluids will leak to the ground. In this area most of the expected fauna can be found. Also, {{it is more likely}} that rove beetles and other non-flying [...] insects will be found here instead of directly on the body. <b>Fly</b> <b>maggots,</b> initially deposited on the body, may also be found below.|$|R
50|$|These animals {{should be}} housed singly or in pairs and need a large, well-planted terrarium. The {{temperature}} {{should be about}} 28 °C {{during the day and}} drop to around 20 °C at night. The humidity should be maintained between 65 and 75%.

5000|$|Recent {{research}} involving blow <b>flies</b> {{ranges from}} <b>maggot</b> therapy to identifying {{different species of}} bird blow <b>flies.</b> <b>Maggot</b> Debridement Therapy (MDT) uses specially selected fly larvae for the cleansing of non-healing wounds. Gangrenous wounds are examples of non-healing wounds that can clinically be treated more effectively by MDT than more common treatments. “Medicinal maggots have three actions: 1) they debride (clean) wounds by dissolving the dead (necrotic), infected tissue; 2) they disinfect the wound, by killing bacteria; and 3) they stimulate wound healing.” [...] According to the Federal Drug Administration, medicinal maggots are the first live organisms to be marketed in the United States.|$|R

5000|$|The word [...] "bot" [...] in {{this sense}} means a maggot. A warble is a skin lump or callus such as might be caused by an ill-fitting harness, or by the {{presence}} of a warble <b>fly</b> <b>maggot</b> under the skin. The human botfly, Dermatobia hominis, is the only species of bot flies whose larvae ordinarily parasitise humans, though flies in some other families episodically cause human myiasis, and are sometimes more harmful.|$|R
30|$|In {{this period}} of time‚ two guilds of carrion-dwelling insects; adult beetles in the family of Histerida (Coleoptera) and <b>fly</b> <b>maggots</b> of the Calliphoridae family were {{collected}} from the soil surface near the carrion. Saprinus planiusculus adults were collected only during the night. Decomposition time for the mouse lasted 38  days. S. planiusculus {{was seen in the}} fresh to post decay stages of body decomposition and the largest number of this species caught in the decay stage.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1028, <b>fly</b> <b>maggots</b> were {{commonly}} used to treat chronic wounds or ulcers to prevent or arrest necrotic spread, as some species of maggots consume only dead flesh, leaving nearby living tissue unaffected. This practice largely died out after the introduction of antibiotics, acetonitrile and enzyme to the range of treatments for wounds. In recent times, however, maggot therapy has regained some credibility and is sometimes employed with great efficacy in cases of chronic tissue necrosis.|$|R

We report a case of orbital myiasis from the species Chrysomya bezziana complicating squamous cell carcinoma of the eyelid.

50|$|Sarcophaginae : The {{majority}} of {{species in the}} large genus Sarcophaga are scavengers of small carrion, such as dead insects and snails or smaller vertebrates. A few species feed on larger vertebrate carcasses. Flesh <b>fly</b> <b>maggots</b> occasionally eat other larvae, although this is usually because the other larvae are smaller {{and get in the}} way. Flesh flies and their larvae are also known to eat decaying vegetable matter and excrement, and they may be found around compost piles and pit latrines.|$|R
2500|$|Due to its {{widespread}} distribution, Oiceoptoma noveboracense {{is frequently}} found on carrion and associated crime scene investigations. They are currently used to substantiate and support insect colonization timelines and help estimate Post-mortem interval (PMI). Arriving variably after initial insect colonizers (flies), the adults will prey on <b>fly</b> <b>maggots</b> and rarely {{feed on the}} carrion. They {{can also be found}} in the later stages of decomposition depending on variables like temperature, climate, and location of the carrion. [...] Ultimately, if found, these beetles corroborate the PMI data of the more useful insect colonizers with succession-pattern-based information.|$|R
50|$|Competition {{from other}} organisms for the carrion puts the Silphids at both an {{advantage}} and a disadvantage. The {{advantage is that}} fly competitors lay eggs that result in maggots and supply food for Silphids. The disadvantage for the Nicrophorinae {{is that if the}} carcass is already “blown”, referring to Shakespearean time as being infected with <b>fly</b> <b>maggots,</b> they will not colonize. Nicrophorinae have adapted to these situations and will bury the carcass to remove it from other competitors. With this technique, a steady food source is available for the larvae and procreation chances increase.|$|R
40|$|Trogidae is a {{cosmopolitan}} family whose species have mainly necrophagous habits.

From July 1991 to September 1993 the trogid beetle Omorgus (Omorgus) suberosus (Fabr.) (Coleoptera:Trogidae) were abundantly collected in poultry manure in Monte Mor, SP, with pitfall-traps.

5000|$|The Piophilidae are {{a family}} of [...] "true flies", in the order Diptera. The {{so-called}} cheese flies are the best-known members, but most species of the Piophilidae are scavengers in animal products, carrion, and fungi. They may accordingly be important in forensic entomology and medical entomology. For a <b>fly</b> <b>maggot,</b> the larvae of many species have an unusually well-developed ability to leap when alarmed or when abandoning their larval food to pupate; they accordingly may be known as cheese skippers or other kinds of skippers according to their food source.|$|R
