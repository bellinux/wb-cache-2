If the Teutonic settlers really first established themselves here a century later than their conquest of Kent, we can only account for it by the supposition that York and the Brigantes, the old metropolis of the provinces, held out far more stubbornly and successfully than Rochester and Anderida, with their very servile Romanised population. But even {{the words of the}} Chronicle do not necessarily imply that Ida was the first king of the Northumbrians, or that the settlement of the country took place in his days.[2] And if they did, we need not feel bound to accept their testimony, considering that the earliest date we can assign for the composition of the chronicle is the reign of Ælfred: while Bæda, the earlier native Northumbrian historian, throws no light at all upon the question. <b>Hence</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> probable that Nennius preserves a truthful tradition, and that the English settled in the region between the Forth and the Tyne, at least as early as the Jutes settled in Kent or the Saxons along the South Coast, from Pevensey Bay to Southampton Water.|$|E

60|$|If we {{admit that}} the females of the Homoptera and Orthoptera {{appreciate}} the musical tones emitted by their male partners, and that the various instruments for this purpose have been perfected through sexual selection, there is little improbability in the females of other insects appreciating beauty in form or colour, and consequently in such characters having been thus gained by the males.

This is more especially difficult in those Orders, such as the Orthoptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera, in which the two sexes rarely differ much in colour; for we are thus cut off from our best evidence of some relation between the reproduction of the species and colour.

But, as we have seen, organic beings long habituated to certain uniform conditions under a state of nature, when subjected, as under confinement, to a considerable change in their conditions, very frequently are rendered more or less sterile; and we know that a cross between two forms that have become widely or specifically different, produce hybrids which are almost always in some degree sterile. I am fully persuaded that this double parallelism is by no means an accident or an illusion. He who is able to explain why the elephant, and a multitude of other animals, are incapable of breeding when kept under only partial confinement in their native country, will be able to explain the primary cause of hybrids being so generally sterile. He will at the same time be able to explain how it is that the races of some of our domesticated animals, which have often been subjected to new and not uniform conditions, are quite fertile together, although they are descended from distinct species, which would probably have been sterile if aboriginally crossed. The above two parallel series of facts seem to be connected together by some common but unknown bond, which is essentially related to the principle of life; this principle, according to Mr. Herbert Spencer, being that life depends on, or consists in, the incessant action and reaction of various forces, which, as throughout nature, are always tending towards an equilibrium; and when this tendency is slightly disturbed by any change, the vital forces gain in power.|$|E

60|$|<b>Hence</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me, {{as it has}} to {{many other}} naturalists, that the view of each species having been {{produced}} in one area alone, and having subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most probable. Undoubtedly many cases occur, in which we cannot explain how the same species could have passed from one point to the other. But the geographical and climatal changes, which have certainly occurred within recent geological times, must have interrupted or rendered discontinuous the formerly continuous range of many species. So that we are reduced to consider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous and of so grave a nature, {{that we ought to}} give up the belief, rendered probable by general considerations, that each species has been produced within one area, and has migrated thence as far as it could. It would be hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same species, now living at distant and separated points; nor do I for a moment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many such cases. But after some preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of the most striking classes of facts; namely, the existence of the same species on the summits of distant mountain-ranges, and at distant points in the arctic and antarctic regions; and secondly (in the following chapter), the wide distribution of freshwater productions; and thirdly, the occurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on the mainland, though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea. If the existence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the earth's surface, can in many instances be explained on the view of each species having migrated from a single birthplace; then, considering our ignorance with respect to former climatal and geographical changes and various occasional means of transport, the belief that this has been the universal law, seems to me incomparably the safest.|$|E
60|$|As Gravity {{makes the}} Sea flow round the denser and weightier Parts of the Globe of the Earth, so the Attraction {{may make the}} watry Acid flow round the denser and {{compacter}} Particles of Earth for composing the Particles of Salt. For otherwise the Acid would not do the Office of a Medium between the Earth and common Water, for making Salts dissolvable in the Water; nor would Salt of Tartar readily draw off the Acid from dissolved Metals, nor Metals the Acid from Mercury. Now, as in the great Globe of the Earth and Sea, the densest Bodies by their Gravity sink down in Water, and always endeavour to go towards the Center of the Globe; so in Particles of Salt, the densest Matter may always endeavour to approach the Center of the Particle: So that a Particle of Salt may be compared to a Chaos; being dense, hard, dry, and earthy in the Center; and rare, soft, moist, and watry in the Circumference. And <b>hence</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to be that Salts are of a lasting Nature, being scarce destroy'd, unless by drawing away their watry Parts by violence, or by letting them soak into the Pores of the central Earth by a gentle Heat in Putrefaction, until the Earth be dissolved by the Water, and separated into smaller Particles, which by reason of their Smallness make the rotten Compound appear of a black Colour. Hence also it may be, that the Parts of Animals and Vegetables preserve their several Forms, and assimilate their Nourishment; the soft and moist Nourishment easily changing its Texture by a gentle Heat and Motion, till it becomes like the dense, hard, dry, and durable Earth in the Center of each Particle. But when the Nourishment grows unfit to be assimilated, or the central Earth grows too feeble to assimilate it, the Motion ends in Confusion, Putrefaction, and Death.|$|E

Man, {{diminutive}} man, who, if he walked on all fours, would be {{no bigger than a}} silly sheep, and who only partially disguises his native smallness by his acquired habit of walking erect on what ought to be his hind legs--man has upset the whole balanced economy of nature, and is everywhere expelling and exterminating before him the great herbivores, his predecessors.

But we are still a long way off from that final consummation, even on dry land; while as for the water, it appears highly probable that there are as good fish still in the sea as ever came out of it. Whether man himself, now become the sole dominant animal of our poor old planet, will ever develop into Titanic proportions, seems far more problematical. The race is now no longer to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. Brain counts for more than muscle, and mind has gained the final victory over mere matter. Goliath of Gath has shrunk into insignificance before the Gatling gun; as in the fairy tales of old, it is cunning little Jack with his clever devices who wins the day against the heavy, clumsy, muddle-headed giants. Nowadays it is our 'Minotaurs' and 'Warriors' that are the real leviathans and behemoths of the great deep; our Krupps and Armstrongs are the fire-breathing krakens of the latter-day seas. Instead of developing individually into huge proportions, the human race tends rather to aggregate into vast empires, which compete with one another by means of huge armaments, and invent mitrailleuses and torpedos of incredible ferocity for their mutual destruction. The dragons of the prime that tare each other in their slime have yielded place to eighty-ton guns and armour-plated turret-ships. Those are the genuine lineal representatives on our modern seas of the secondary saurians. Let us hope that some coming geologist of the dim future, finding the fossil remains of the sunken 'Captain,' or the plated scales of the 'Comte de Grasse,' firmly embedded in the upheaved ooze of the existing Atlantic, may shake his head in solemn deprecation at the horrid sight, and thank heaven that such hideous carnivorous creatures no longer exist in his own day.|$|E

The Glacial period, as measured by years, must have been very long; and when we remember over what vast spaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread within a few centuries, this period will have been ample for any amount of migration. As the cold came slowly on, all the tropical plants and other productions will have retreated from both sides towards the equator, followed in the rear by the temperate productions, and these by the arctic; but with the latter we are not now concerned. The tropical plants probably suffered much extinction; how much no one can say; perhaps formerly the tropics supported as many species as we see at the present day crowded together at the Cape of Good Hope, and in parts of temperate Australia. As we know that many tropical plants and animals can withstand a considerable amount of cold, many might have escaped extermination during a moderate fall of temperature, more especially by escaping into the warmest spots. But the great fact to bear in mind is, that all tropical productions will have suffered to a certain extent. On the other hand, the temperate productions, after migrating nearer to the equator, though they will have been placed under somewhat new conditions, will have suffered less. And it is certain that many temperate plants, if protected from the inroads of competitors, can withstand a much warmer climate than their own. <b>Hence,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me possible, bearing in mind that the tropical productions were in a suffering state and could not have presented a firm front against intruders, that a certain number of the more vigorous and dominant temperate forms might have penetrated the native ranks and have reached or even crossed the equator. The invasion would, of course, have been greatly favoured by high land, and perhaps by a dry climate; for Dr. Falconer informs me that it is the damp with the heat of the tropics which is so destructive to perennial plants from a temperate climate. On the other hand, the most humid and hottest districts will have afforded an asylum to the tropical natives. The mountain-ranges north-west of the Himalaya, and the long line of the Cordillera, seem to have afforded two great lines of invasion: and it is a striking fact, lately communicated to me by Dr. Hooker, that all the flowering plants, about forty-six in number, common to Tierra del Fuego and to Europe still exist in North America, which must have lain on the line of march.

At this period of extreme cold, I believe that the climate under the equator at the level of the sea was about the same with that now felt there at the height of six or seven thousand feet.

In a {{previous}} study we provided thin-layer chromatographic, polarimetric, and other experimental evidence that phenylglycine can undergo easy spontaneous pep-tidization in abiotic aqueous media.

In our earlier research it was also shown that spontaneous oscillatory chiral conversion was characteristic not only of amino acids but also of several other classes of carboxylic acid, including profen drugs and hydroxy acids. We therefore decided to check whether selected chiral hydroxy acids – lactic acid and mandelic acid – previously recognized for their ability to undergo spontaneous oscillatory chiral conversion, could also furnish the respective polyacids.

[...] He also acknowledged that [...] "we are certainly an institution that honors its past. <b>Hence</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> reasonable that students and alumni be allowed to use the image as a celebration of that past, to the extent that they may choose".|$|E
5000|$|The exact {{origin and}} nature of the Vardariotai is uncertain. The name first appears in the tenth century, when a bishopric of the [...] "Vardariotai or Tourkoi" [...] is {{mentioned}} as subject to the diocese of Thessalonica. The mid-fourteenth century writer Pseudo-Kodinos calls them [...] "Persians" [...] by race (a typical Byzantine anachronism for [...] "Turks"), and recalls that they were settled in the Vardar river valley by an unnamed Byzantine emperor of old. In both cases, however, [...] "Turks" [...] probably implies the Magyars, who were called [...] "Tourkoi" [...] by the Byzantines in the tenth-eleventh centuries. <b>Hence</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that the Vardariotai were Magyars resettled in Macedonia in the tenth century, and that they had become Christians {{by the end of that}} century.|$|E
50|$|It {{was between}} the 12th and the 8th centuries BC that the first Cycladic cities were built, {{including}} four on Kea (Ioulis, Korissia, Piessa and Karthaia) and Zagora on Andros, the houses of which were surrounded by a wall dated by archaeologists to 850 BC. Ceramics indicate the diversity of local production, and thus {{the differences between the}} islands. <b>Hence,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that Naxos, the islet of Donoussa and above all Andros had links with Euboea, while Milos and Santorini were in the Doric sphere of influence.Zagora, {{one of the most important}} urban settlements of the era which it has been possible to study, reveals that the type of traditional buildings found there evolved little between the 9th century BC and the 19th century. The houses had flat roofs made of schist slabs covered up with clay and truncated corners designed to allow beasts of burden to pass by more easily.|$|E
60|$|As fancy pigeons are {{generally}} confined in aviaries of moderate size, and as even when not confined {{they do not}} search for their own food, they must during many generations have used their wings incomparably less than the wild rock-pigeon. <b>Hence</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to me probable that all {{the parts of the}} skeleton subservient to flight would be found to be reduced in size. With respect to the sternum, I have carefully measured its extreme length in twelve birds of different breeds, and in two wild rock-pigeons from the Shetland Islands. For the proportional comparison I have tried three standards of measurement, with all twelve birds namely, the length {{from the base of the}} beak to the oil-gland, to the end of the tail, and from the extreme tip to tip of wings. The result has been in each case nearly the same, the sternum being invariably found to be shorter than in the wild rock-pigeon. I will give only a single table, as calculated by the standard from the base of the beak to the oil-gland; for the result in this case is nearly the mean between the results obtained by the two other standards.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} hybridogenesis is {{expected}} {{to shed light on}} the role played by the so-called ‘asexual reproduction’ in vertebrate evolution, since hybridogenesis, gynogenesis and parthenogenesis are restricted to lower vertebrates. <b>Hence,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> interesting to define the stage and time of germline differentiation in reproductively unstable organisms which, to accomplish functional gamete maturation, can change the normal approach to meiosis by means of unusual cytological steps, such as genome elimination and endoreduplication. The cytogenetic aspects of ‘asexual’ meiosis have already been thoroughly studied. At present, molecular investigations are in progress to characterise the single steps of germline differentiation in a hybridogenetic green frog system, and the results obtained so far can be considered promising, as shown in this work. Vasa, PL 10 and Y-box homolog genes, first isolated in Rana (Pelophylax), are expressed during early phases of gametogenesis in R. (P.) ridibunda and R. (P.) lessonae (parental species), and R. (P.) esculenta (their natural hybrid), suggesting that gametogenesis, during the adult life, follows a unique genetic sequence in the two parental species as well as in hybridogenetic hybrids. Similar molecular investigations need to be carried out on larval stages prior to metamorphosis, when the genetic plasticity of gemline cells allows their commitment versus either the standard and/or hybridogenetic reproduction mode...|$|R
6000|$|Wodrow, the {{historian}} of the sufferings of the Kirk, declares that through the riotous proceedings of the religious malcontents [...] "the country resembled war as much as peace." [...] But an Act of Council of 1677 bidding landowners sign a bond for the peaceable behaviour of all on their lands was refused obedience by many western lairds. They could not enforce order, they said: <b>hence</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to follow that there was much disorder. Those who refused were, by a stretch {{of the law of}} [...] "law-burrows," [...] bound over to keep the peace of the Government. Lauderdale, having nothing that we would call a police, little money, and a small insufficient force of regulars, called in [...] "the Highland Host," [...] the retainers of Atholl, Glenorchy, Mar, Moray, and Airlie, and other northern lords, and quartered them on the disturbed districts for a month. They were then sent home bearing their spoils (February 1678). Atholl and Perth (later to be the Catholic minister of James II.) now went over to [...] "the Party," [...] the opposition, Hamilton's party; Hamilton and others rode to London to complain against Lauderdale, but he, aided by the silver tongue of Mackenzie, who had changed sides, won over Charles, and Lauderdale's assailants were helpless.|$|R
