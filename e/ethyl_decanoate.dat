40|$|Changes in the {{aromatic}} composition {{as well as}} {{sensory characteristics}} in Verdejo white wines were analysed based on two factors: the winemaking methodology and the storing time of wine in bottles. The volatile components were determined by GLC-MS, and the sensory profile was designed and assessed according to the ISO 11035 standard. The results showed that when wines were made in oak barrels, either completely or partially, which means the wines were {{in contact with the}} lees, the levels of 1 -octanol, ethyl heptanoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate</b> were significantly affected (P menor que 0. 05); the softness sensation was also influenced (P menor que 0. 05). However, the amount of time the wines were stored in bottles significantly affected (P menor que 0. 05) the levels of 1 -hexanol, ethyl heptanoate, ethyl octanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate,</b> hexyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and isoamyl lactate and also an odour note (tropical fruit). The compounds with higher OAV values belong to the groups of esters and fatty acids.

40|$|The aroma {{fraction}} of Italian distillates of wild (Pyrus amygidaliformis, Vill., namely ‘Pirastru’) and cultivated (Pyrus communis, L. cvs. ‘Coscia’, ‘Precoce di Fiorano’ and ‘Butirru de Austu’) pear varieties {{grown in the}} northern part of the island of Sardinia was investigated. Distillates from fermented mashes were obtained from the same producer and, in most cases, for 3 years following the same production process. Aroma analyses were performed by GC-FID and GC-MS techniques with direct GC injection of full proof distillates. Differences were found in the aromatic profile of all the distillates depending on their varietal origin. Wild Pirastru pear distillates were the richest in isoeugenol (0. 186 g hL - 1 a. a.), ethyl benzoate (0. 388 g hL - 1 a. a.) and ethyl phenylacetate (0. 12 g hL - 1 a. a.) but the poorest in 1 -hexanol (2. 69 g hL - 1 a. a.), n-hexyl acetate (0. 07 g hL - 1 a. a.), ∑-farnesene isomers (0. 80 g hL - 1 a. a.) and citronellol (0. 007 g hL - 1 a. a.). Pirastru distillates were also the poorest in methyl and <b>ethyl</b> unsaturated <b>decanoate</b> isomers, the socalled Williams pear esters (0. 002 g hL - 1 a. a.). On the contrary, these compounds that characterise the aroma of Williams pear distillates were abundant in Coscia spirits (1. 032 g hL - 1 a. a.). The latter, together with Precoce di Fiorano, were rich in farnesene isomers (6. 48 and 9. 26 g hL - 1 a. a. respectively). Evaluation of the data by univariate (ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis) and multivariate (PCA and HCA) statistical analyses revealed that some components (the classes of acetates, farnesene isomers, methyl and <b>ethyl</b> unsaturated <b>decanoate</b> esters and citronellol) are relevant in discriminating the distillates according to variety...|$|R
40|$|Medium-chain {{fatty acids}} (octanoic and decanoic acids) {{are well known}} as {{fermentation}} inhibitors. During must fermentation, the toxicity of these fatty acids is enhanced by ethanol and low pH, which favors their entrance in the cell, resulting in a decrease of internal pH. We present here the characterization of the mechanisms involved {{in the establishment of}} the resistance to these fatty acids. The analysis of the transcriptome response to the exposure to octanoic and decanoic acids revealed that two partially overlapping mechanisms are activated; both responses share many genes with an oxidative stress response, but some key genes were activated differentially. The transcriptome response to octanoic acid stress can be described mainly as a weak acid response, and it involves Pdr 12 p as the main transporter. The phenotypic analysis of knocked-out strains confirmed the role of the Pdr 12 p transporter under the control of WAR 1 but also revealed the involvement of the Tpo 1 p major facilitator superfamily proteins (MFS) transporter in octanoic acid expulsion. In contrast, the resistance to decanoic acid is composite. It also involves the transporter Tpo 1 p and includes the activation of several genes of the beta-oxidation pathway and ethyl ester synthesis. Indeed, the induction of FAA 1 and EEB 1, coding for a long-chain fatty acyl coenzyme A synthetase and an alcohol acyltransferase, respectively, suggests a detoxification pathway through the production of <b>decanoate</b> <b>ethyl</b> ester. These results are confirmed by the sensitivity of strains bearing deletions for the transcription factors encoded by PDR 1, STB 5, OAF 1, and PIP 2 genes...|$|R
40|$|Volatile esters are {{responsible}} for the fruity character of fermented beverages and thus constitute a vital group of aromatic compounds in beer and wine. Many fermentation parameters are known to affect volatile ester production. In order to get insight into the production of ethyl esters during fermentation, we investigated the influence of several fermentation variables. A higher level of unsaturated fatty acids in the fermentation medium resulted in a general decrease of ethyl ester production. On the other hand, a higher fermentation temperature resulted in a higher <b>ethyl</b> octanoate and <b>decanoate</b> production, while a higher carbon or nitrogen content of the fermentation medium resulted in only moderate changes in ethyl ester production. Expression analysis of the ethyl ester biosynthesis genes EEB 1 and EHT 1 after addition of medium chain fatty acid (MCFA) precursors suggested that the expression level is not the limiting factor for ethyl ester production, as opposed to acetate ester production. Together with the previous demonstration that provision of medium-chain fatty acids, which are the substrates for ethyl ester formation, to the fermentation medium causes a strong increase {{in the formation of the}} corresponding ethyl esters, this result further supports an important role for precursor availability in ethyl ester production. We conclude that, at least in our fermentation conditions and with our yeast strain, the fatty acid precursor level rather than the activity of the biosynthetic enzymes is the major limiting factor for ethyl ester production. The expression level and activity of the fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes therefore appears to be a prime target for flavor modification by alteration of process parameters or through strain selection. status: publishe...|$|R

The analytical method is simple, selective, and appropriated for {{the determination of}} esters in distilled spirits. The limit of detection ranged from 29 (ethyl hexanoate) to 530 (ethyl acetate) mu g L- 1, whereas the standard deviation for repeatability was between 0. 774 % (ethyl hexanoate) and 5. 05 % (isoamyl octanoate). Relative standard deviation values for accuracy vary from 90. 3 to 98. 5 % for ethyl butyrate and ethyl acetate, respectively. Ethyl acetate was shown to be the major ester in cachaca (median content of 22. 6 mg 100 mL(- 1) anhydrous alcohol), followed by ethyl lactate (median content of 8. 32 mg 100 mL(- 1) anhydrous alcohol). Cachaca produced in copper and hybrid alembic present a higher content of ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate than those produced in a stainless-steel column, whereas cachaca produced by distillation in a stainless-steel column present a higher content of ethyl octanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate,</b> and ethyl laurate.

Phenethyl alcohol was detected from all the cell cultures, indicating this compound is an endogenous metabolite derived from P. pastoris yeast itself from wort medium used. Apart from phenethyl alcohol, none of volatile ester compounds was observed from the control strain. For the recombinant strains, production of ethyl esters was observed to increase with the increasing chain length from C 6 to C 10. As shown in Fig.  2, recombinant yeast P. pastoris-EHT 1 produced fatty acid ethyl esters including ethyl hexanoate (C 6), ethyl octanoate (C 8) and <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate</b> (C 10), corresponding to 2, 10 and 11  % of total volatiles, respectively.

Key experimental factors influencing the equilibrium of the VOCs and SVOCs between the sample and the SPME fibre, as the type of fibre coating, extraction time and temperature, sample stirring and ionic strength, were optimized. The performance of five commercially available SPME fibres was evaluated and compared, namely polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, 100 μm); polyacrylate (PA, 85 μm); polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB, 65 μm); carboxen™/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS, 75 μm) and the divinylbenzene/carboxen on polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS, 50 / 30 μm) (StableFlex). An objective comparison among different alcoholic beverages {{has been established in}} terms of qualitative and semi-quantitative differences on volatile and semi-volatile compounds. These compounds belong to several chemical families, including higher alcohols, ethyl esters, fatty acids, higher alcohol acetates, isoamyl esters, carbonyl compounds, furanic compounds, terpenoids, C 13 -norisoprenoids and volatile phenols. The optimized extraction conditions and GC–qMSD, lead to the successful identification of 44 compounds in white wines, 64 in beers and 104 in whiskys.

An increase in hydrogen sulfide partial pressure decreases the average degree of reduction and uncoordination of the active sites and inhibits the hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation pathways, the first being affected to a larger extent. This accounts for the decrease of guaiacol dehydroxylation and the increase of 4 -methylacetophenone conversion.

The resulting three levels of nitrogen were: Control 450 mg/L YAN, 600 mg/L YAN and 700 mg/L YAN. Half the wines were subjected to a short-term artificial ageing (6 weeks at 30 ° C) and then aged at 8 ° C for 8. 5 months. The remainder were naturally aged for 10 months at 8 ° C. The chemical composition of the treatment wines was investigated. Standard wine composition parameters were determined (e. g. alcohol, titratable acidity, residual sugar). HS-SPME-GC-MS methods were used to measure specific volatile fatty acids, esters and sulphides. A sensory panel of wine professionals {{was used to determine}} if there were sensory differences between the wine treatments.

Conversely, artificially aging the wines significantly increased the concentration of four esters and decreased hexyl acetate; b) fatty acid concentrations decreased with nitrogen addition with the exception of decanoic acid, which significantly increased.

Multidimensional scaling analysis of the sensory data showed the participants could differentiate that the wines had age related differences. Any sensory effects from variations in DAP addition were not able to be perceived either because the variation was to subtle or overwhelmed by the more obvious differences caused by the artificial aging. The aged wines were described as more “mature”, “reduced”, “jammy” with less “floral, fruity” on the nose.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the role of}} {{different}} yeast strains {{in the production of}} volatile flavour components of Tokaji Aszú wine was tested. The effect of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae starter and that of the typical endogenous Candida stellata strain as well as spontaneous fermentation were studied and compared. For the fast comparison of aroma profile, a solid phase microextraction (SPME) sampling and a GC-MS separation and identification were used. Thirty of the present compounds were selected to characterise the changes of flavour. Significant differences were found between wines fermented with different yeast strains. Application of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae starter alone accelerated the fermentation but this caused only little change in the aroma profile and content. Candida stellata contributed weakly to the production of aroma, especially to that of the longer carbon chain ethyl esters. Characteristic compounds of aged wine were detected in bottle aged Tokaji Aszú. The change of aroma profile as a function of bottle storage time was studied. The concentrations of vitispirane, trimethyl dihydronaphtalene, 2 -phenylethanol and diethyl succinate increased in the course of ageing time, while those of 3 -methyl-butyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate</b> and ethyl dodecanoate decreased...|$|E
40|$|The water {{activity}} dependence of lipase kinetics in organic media was evaluated using lipases from Rhizopus oryzae and Candida rugosa immobilised on polypropene EP- 100. The conversion studied was the transesterification of <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate</b> to hexyl decanoate with hydrolysis to decanoic acid as competing reaction. The reactions {{were carried out}} at controlled {{water activity}} in diisopropyl ether. Substrate inhibition was observed at hexanol concentrations of 100 mM or higher. The Rhizopus lipase expressed the highest activity and the best selectivity for transesterification at the lowest water activity (a(w) = 0. 06). The Candida lipase expressed the highest transesterification/hydrolysis ratio at a(w) = 0. 11 and the highest total activity at a(w) = 0. 53. Several glycosidases previously tested under conditions {{similar to those used}} here expressed both maximal total activity and the best selectivity at water activities close to 1. 0. The water activity dependence of the lipases is thus fundamentally different from that of glycosidases and it is {{a major part of the}} reason why lipases are more suited for transferase-type reactions than the glycosidases.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis and Kluyveromyces marxianus strains {{to the typical}} flavour of traditional ewes' and goats' cheeses was assessed. Fourteen yeast strains were grown in liquid medium mimicking cheese composition and volatile compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Yeasts were able to produce key volatile compounds characteristic of the cheeses from which they were isolated. Inter-species and inter-strain variations were observed. Under the conditions tested, D. hansenii produced the lowest levels of volatile compounds, with large intra-strain variations. Kluyveromyces strains primarily produced esters and alcohols. K. marxianus strains {{were associated with the}} production of acids, <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate,</b> 1 -propanol and benzaldehyde, whereas K. lactis was correlated with the presence of ketones, ethyl acetate and secondary alcohols. In conclusion, this study shows the heterogeneous potential of dairy yeasts to contribute to final cheese flavour.

40|$|A {{nitrogen}} deficiency always causes bog bilberry syrup wine {{to have a}} poor sensory feature. This study investigated the effect of nitrogen source addition on volatile compounds during bog bilberry syrup wine fermentation. The syrup was supplemented with 60, 90, 120 or 150 mg/L dibasic ammonium phosphate (DAP) before fermentation. Results showed that an increase of DAP amounts accelerated fermentation rate, increased alcohol content, and decreased sugar level. Total phenol and total flavonoid content were also enhanced {{with the increase of}} DAP amounts. A total of 91 volatile compounds were detected in the wine and their concentrations were significantly enhanced with the increase of DAP. Ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, phenethyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate,</b> isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol, levo- 2, 3 -butanediol, 2 -phenylethanol, meso- 2, 3 -butanediol, isobutyric acid, hexanoic acid, and octanoic acid exhibited a significant increase of their odor activity value (OAV) with the increase of DAP amounts. Bog bilberry syrup wine possessed fruity, fatty, and caramel flavors as its major aroma, whereas a balsamic note was the least present. The increase of DAP amounts significantly improved the global aroma attributes, thereby indicating that DAP supplementation could promote wine fermentation performance and enhance the sensory quality of bog bilberry syrup wine...|$|E
40|$|Caninha is a Brazilian cane aguardent, with an {{alcoholic}} graduation from 38 to 54 GL, produced by distillation of fermented sugarcane juice. Volatile compounds (49) of caninha samples not aged and aged in oak or balsam barrels {{were determined by}} GC/FID, GC/MS and GC/Sniffing/aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA). Esters represented the largest group, followed by alcohols and acids. The concentrations of <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate</b> and ethyl dodecanoate found in the caninha aged in oak were higher than those from samples not aged and aged in balsam. 2 -Methylpropanol and 3 -methylbutanol, and decanoic and dodecanoic were the major alcohols and acids, respectively, present in caninha samples. GC/Sniffing/ AEDA analysis indicated a lower content of off-odour notes in aged caninha (31 – 35 %) when compared with not aged one (57 %). Important odour notes of wood and caninha-like were sniffed in all the aged samples {{in the range from}} 70 to 78 min, at a maximum dilution factor of 23. As the results of AEDA indicated, both methylbutanol, ethyl octanoate and 2 -phenylethanol appeared to be important contributors to overall aroma of all the aged caninhas studied. Only 3 -methylbutanol and ethyl octanoate were considered as important odourants to the not aged caninha aroma...|$|E
40|$|The aroma {{profile of}} red wine is complex and {{research}} focusing on aroma compounds and their links to viticultural and enological practices is needed. Current research is limited to wines made from cold-hardy cultivars (interspecific hybrids of vinifera and native N. American grapes). The objective {{of this research was}} to develop a fully automated solid phase microextraction (SPME) method, using tandem gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) -olfactometry for the simultaneous chemical and sensory analysis of volatile/semi-volatile compounds and aroma in cold-hardy red wines. Specifically, the effects of SPME coating selection, extraction time, extraction temperature, incubation time, sample volume, desorption time, and salt addition were studied. The developed method was used to determine the aroma profiles of seven selected red wines originating from four different cold-hardy grape cultivars. Thirty-six aroma compounds were identified from Maréchal Foch, St. Croix, Frontenac, Vincent, and a Maréchal Foch/Frontenac blend. Among these 36 aroma compounds, isoamyl alcohol, ethyl caproate, benzeneethanol, <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate,</b> and ethyl caproate are the top five most abundant aroma compounds. Olfactometry helps to identify compounds not identified by MS. The presented method can be useful for grape growers and wine makers for the screening of aroma compounds {{in a wide variety of}} wines and can be used to balance desired wine aroma characteristics...|$|E
40|$|There {{are four}} main Pinot noir wine regions in New Zealand: Central Otago, Marlborough, Martinborough and Waipara. These regions {{specialize}} in this variety as the soil, climate and other conditions are {{well suited to}} this grape. Beside being grown in these regions the wines are also marketed as regional products. Place of origin labelling implies that wines from one region will have different aroma and flavour characteristics from wines from other regions. This project determined the characteristics that best differentiate the regional styles of New Zealand Pinot noir. Marlborough Pinot noir was characterized by greater raspberry, red cherry, red fruit and red berry aromas, longer finish length and more harmonious balance. Martinborough Pinot noir was characterized by greater black cherry, chocolate, oak and spice aromas and oak tannin. Waipara Pinot noir was characterized by greater barnyard, herbal and violet aromas and in-mouth fruit density/concentration. Central Otago Pinot noir was characterized by fuller body. As regional wines {{were found to be}} stylistically different, the ability of tasters to discriminate regional wines was tested using paired comparison and sorting analysis. Tasters were not successful at discriminating regional wine examples using these techniques. This may be due to conceptual models that are not representative of the regional wines. In order to determine the possible causes of these regional differences the chemical composition of the wines was also investigated. Three HS-SPME-GC-MS methods were developed specifically for Pinot noir wine to measure 34 different volatile organic compounds. One method measured compounds found at higher concentrations, namely esters and alcohols, the second method measured volatile fatty acids and the third measured trace compounds present at very low concentrations. With the two sets of information, sensory and chemical, it was possible to find relationships using canonical correlation analysis. Results indicated four aroma compounds of particular importance: ethyl octanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate,</b> 2 -phenyl ethanol and benzaldehyde. Addition/omission tests were used to determine the influence of each compound on Pinot noir aroma. The compounds were added in combination and at varying concentrations to a wine matrix, which consisted of a commerical Pinot noir that contained low levels of the compounds of interest. In 8 of 10 triangle tests panellists were able to successfully identify samples with different concentrations of the components. Panellists also used descriptive analysis to determine the influence of these compounds. From the descriptive analysis results it was found the 2 -phenyl ethanol influenced the perception of violet aroma, ethyl octanoate influenced red cherry aroma and the combination of ethyl octanoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate</b> influenced black cherry aroma. The measurement of the effect of these aroma compounds is a first step to understanding some factors of regional style since red cherry, black cherry and violets were descriptors that characterize the regional styles of New Zealand Pinot noir...|$|E
30|$|Apart from ethyl esters, {{considerable}} methyl esters {{were observed}} in this study (Fig.  2), likely {{to be due to}} the inductive agent (methanol) of the expression system, where the yeast had priority in utilizing methanol in place of ethanol if sufficient methanol was present. In particular, either of the recombinant strain resulted in significantly higher levels of methyl decanoate. Indeed, methyl and <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate</b> accounts for 50.4 and 54.2  % of the total volatile aroma esters generated by P. pastoris-EHT 1 and P. pastoris-EEB 1, respectively, indicating a high-availability of decanoyl-CoA as a substrate. Moreover, the two recombinant yeasts both produced methyl nonanoate but not ethyl nonanoate, further indicating the significance of substrate availability. More interestingly, methyl laurate was observed in both strains whereas ethyl laurate was only obtained in P. pastoris-EHT 1. Given the presence of ethyl laurate is relatively low level, it is proposed that the difference between P. pastoris-EHT 1 and P. pastoris-EEB 1 was little. Furthermore, the formation of methyl esters also provides an explanation for the absence of high level ethyl esters in the volatile products. In future research {{it would be interesting to}} compare affinity of both recombinant enzymes for methanol and ethanol using biochemical in vitro tests, which could provide insights on the production of either ethyl or methyl esters.|$|E
40|$|Montepulciano {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous and {{important}} red-berried grapes of Italy. This article presents and discusses a comparative study of aroma profile and phenolic content of the Montepulciano wine from the Marches and the Abruzzo regions. The volatile composition of wines was determined by using head- space solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The PDMS fibre was chosen. The dominating esters in Montepulciano wines were ethyl hexa- noate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate,</b> and ethyl octanoate, whereas phenyl ethanol and 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol were dom- inating alcohols. Phenolic compounds, namely gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, trans-ferulic acid, caffeic acid, trans-resvera- trol, (+) -catechin and () -epicatechin, were examined using HPLC–MS with direct injection of wine sam- ples. The total phenolic content of the analysed wines was in the range of 30. 4 – 61. 9 mg l 1. The presence of high amounts of esters seems to characterise the volatiles of Montepulciano wines from the Marches, whereas a high level of alcohols was found in Montepulciano wines from Abruzzo. Moreover, multivar- iate chemometric techniques, such as cluster analysis and principal component analysis, supported this thesis. Headspace solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry were used to analyse 20 commercial wine samples (Montepulciano monovarietal red wines) from the Marches (10 samples) and Abruzzo (10 samples) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} of this work was to study and test the nature and influence of reaction media (organic solvent vs. miniemulsion system) on the synthesis of alkyl esters by Fusarium solani pisi cutinase. Ester synthesis and cutinase selectivity for different chain length of acids and alcohols (ethyl and hexyl) were evaluated. In iso-octane cutinase presents rates of esterification after one hour between 0. 24 μmolmg- 1 min- 1 for ethyl oleate and 1. 15 μmolmg- 1 min- 1 for ethyl butyrate, while in miniemulsion system were from 0. 05 μmolmg- 1 min- 1 for ethyl heptanoate to 0. 76 μmolmg- 1 min- 1 for <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate.</b> Rate of reaction for synthesis of hexyl ester in miniemulsion system was from 0. 19 μmolmg- 1 min- 1 for hexyl heptanoate to 1. 07 μmolmg- 1 min- 1 for hexyl decanoate. High conversion yields of 95 % at equilibrium after 8 h of reaction in iso-octane for pentanoic acid (C 5) with ethanol at equimolar concentration (0. 1 M) was achieved. Additionally, this work also shows surprising that was occurred a significant and unexpected change in cutinase selectivity for longer chain length carboxylic acids (C 8 - C 10) in miniemulsion system in relation to C 4 – C 6, observed in this work for organic solvent (iso-octane) and previously in reversed micellar system...|$|E

The yeast were phenotypically characterized and two beer styles were produced under laboratory conditions, a pale ale and a traditional Honndalsøl. The sensory properties were assessed on an untrained panel as a Duo-trio {{test and the}} composition of volatile compounds produced during fermentation and after bottling at different fermentation temperatures was determined using dynamic Head space GC-MS. A genetic analysis of the yeasts internally transcribed spacer 1 and 2 region was performed to assess their species and genetic relationship between the strains. The Kveik strains were compared to reference yeast. All Kveik except one was classified as the genus Saccharomyces, two were classified as S. boulardii, two were classified as S. cerevisiae, one was classified as S. bayanus / S. pastorianus, two were unclassified specie of the Saccharomyces genus. Phenotypical characterization showed a variation of maximum growth rate with over 20 % of selected Kveik strains. Flocculation varies between fully flocculating and non-flocculating. As fermentation temperature increase, the concentration of esters and alcohols increase except longer chained esters. During the fermentation, the concentration of alcohols decrease, esters decrease over time as well except ethyl acetate, ethyl octanoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>decanoate.</b> A sensory panel could distinguish between 3 of the 5 tested yeast strains...|$|E
