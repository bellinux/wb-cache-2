50|$|GW-BASIC has {{a command}} line-based {{integrated}} development environment (IDE) based on Dartmouth BASIC. Using the cursor movement keys, any line displayed on screen can be edited. It also includes function key shortcuts {{at the bottom of}} the screen. Like other early microcomputer versions of BASIC, GW-BASIC lacked many of the structures needed for structured programming such as local variables, and GW-BASIC programs executed relatively slowly, because it was an interpreted programming language. All program lines must be numbered; all non-numbered lines are considered to be commands in direct mode to be executed immediately. Program source files are normally saved in binary compressed format with tokens replacing commands, with an option to save <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>text</b> form.|$|E

This means that instead of using a single Radiosonde ascent capturing local data over a short time period, and circulating that information using older formats, such as the Standard Computer Meteorological message (METCM) under STANAG 4082, it provides a grid of data in four dimensions - vertical, two horizontal and time. The METGM is compiled from many data sources in Weather Analysis Centres (WACs). The data is no longer directly human readable <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>text,</b> like METCM was, and thus {{it can not be}} distributed by voice.

5000|$|The major {{criticism}} {{against the}} UEB code {{is that it}} fails to handle mathematics or computer science as compactly as codes designed to be optimal for those disciplines. Besides requiring more space to represent, and more time to read and write, the verbosity of UEB can make learning mathematics more difficult. [...] Nemeth Braille, officially used in the United States since 1952, and as of 2002 the de facto standard for teaching and doing mathematics in braille in the USA, was specifically invented to correct the cumbersomeness of doing mathematics in braille. However, although the Nemeth encoding standard was officially adopted by the JUTC of the USA and the UK in the 1950s, in practice only the USA switched their mathematical braille to the Nemeth system, whereas the UK continued to use the traditional Henry Martyn Taylor coding (not {{to be confused with}} Hudson Taylor who was involved with the use of Moon Type for the blind in China during the 1800s) for their braille mathematics. Programmers in the United States that write their programming codefiles in braille—as opposed to <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>text</b> with use of a screenreader for example—tend to use Nemeth-syntax numerals, whereas programmers in the UK use yet another system (not Taylor-numerals and not literary-numerals) when writing programming codefiles in braille.|$|E
