40|$|In the UK, water {{companies}} {{renew their}} aging water network using novel techniques and robust materials. The {{most common type}} of material used for network rehabilitation is Polyethylene (PE) pipe. A common method of jointing PE pipe is electrofusion welding. Here, electricity is used to heat a coil that melts the fitting and the host pipe of the same material. When the joint cools it forms a bond. However, premature failure of these can occur if best practice <b>installation</b> <b>principles</b> are not followed on site. A novel experimental rig, designed to be retrofitted to an existing servo-hydraulic fatigue testing machine, has been used to cyclically pressurise PE fittings that have been created with a controlled element of 'poor workmanship'. Extensive fatigue tests have shown the relationship between joint failure and the dynamic pressures experienced in water distribution systems. Furthermore, the effects of poor workmanship have shown to have a detrimental effect on asset integrity. A post-failure analysis of the fittings using non-destructive ultra-sonic methods has shown the failure paths of the fittings. Additionally, a bespoke ultra-sonic rig was designed and built to monitor the crack propagation of the fittings during live dynamic tests to confirm the mode of failure. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2015...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The recent {{accounting}} {{scandals in}} the USA {{and the resulting}} regulation of the US profession via the Sarbanes–Oxley Act {{have led to the}} resurrection of an old debate: <b>principles</b> <b>vs.</b> rules. We argue that such a debate is jejune and serves {{as little more than a}} diversion from discussing more substantive issues raised by events like Enron and Andersen. Accounting is not confronted by a choice of principles to the exclusion of rules or vice versa. Principles underlie any set of rules, and any implementation of principles will inevitably involve adopting some rules. We take issue with various analyses of the accounting scandals that rely too exclusively on the principles of neo-classical economics. We conclude by identifying four major obstacles impeding meaningful academic and educational treatment of the maladies of which Enron is merely a symptom. Rules versus principles, accounting education, decision-usefulness, accounting scandals,...|$|R

40|$|Extending our {{previous}} work filinov-etal. jpa 03 ik {{we present a}} detailed discussion of accuracy and practical applications of finite-temperature pseudopotentials for two-component Coulomb systems. Different pseudopotentials are discussed: i) the diagonal Kelbg potential, ii) the off-diagonal Kelbg potential iii) the improved diagonal Kelbg potential, iv) an effective potential obtained with the Feynman-Kleinert variational <b>principle</b> <b>v)</b> the "exact" quantum pair potential derived from the two-particle density matrix. For the improved diagonal Kelbg potential a simple temperature dependent fit is derived which accurately reproduces the "exact" pair potential in the whole temperature range. The derived pseudopotentials are then used in path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain thermodynamical properties of strongly coupled hydrogen. It is demonstrated that classical MD simulations with spin-dependent interaction potentials for the electrons allow for an accurate description of the internal energy of hydrogen in the difficult regime of partial ionization down to the temperatures of about 60 000 K. Finally, we point out an interesting relation between the quantum potentials and effective potentials used in density functional theory. Comment: 18 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
