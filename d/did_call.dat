It has been updated to better identify keyloggers. In PC Magazine testing, Norton successfully detected all 11 spyware threats and removed all but two. PC Magazine did give Norton credit even when manual removal was required. The suite also removed three of four commercial keyloggers. When attempting to install the spyware on a clean system, Norton blocked all 11 {{and two of the}} four commercial keyloggers. In most cases, it did not block the installation, however Norton <b>did</b> <b>call</b> for a scan after the spyware was installed. In PC Pro testing, Norton detected 78 percent of spyware, removed 82 percent, and blocked 65 percent from installing.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human occupation in the area since the Bronze and Iron Ages. Before the Norman conquest it was held by Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia and after it by William de Moyon and his descendants, who administered the area from Dunster Castle, which was later sold to Sir George Luttrell and his family. There was a small port at Minehead by 1380, which grew into a major trading centre during the medieval period. Most trade transferred to larger ports during the 20th century, but pleasure steamers <b>did</b> <b>call</b> at the port. Major rebuilding {{took place in the}} Lower or Middle town area following a fire in 1791 and the fortunes of the town revived with the growth in sea bathing, and by 1851 was becoming a retirement centre. There was a marked increase in building {{during the early years of}} the 20th century, which resulted in the wide main shopping avenue and adjacent roads with Edwardian style architecture. The town's flood defences were improved after a storm in 1990 caused flooding.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, trade between Minehead and Ireland, South Wales, Bristol and Bridgwater grew, with forty vessels based in the harbour for trade and herring fishing. It was also a departure point for pilgrims to Santiago de Compostella. Until the 19th century trade continued with Ireland but Minehead vessels started to travel further afield to Virginia and the West Indies. Further problems with the port continued and led to a decline in trade and the fisheries in the late 18th century and in 1834 the port lost its jurisdiction to Bridgwater. In the 20th century most trade transferred to larger ports, but pleasure steamers <b>did</b> <b>call</b> at the port. Minehead Lifeboat Station was established in 1901 near the harbour. The pier was demolished during the Second World War as it obstructed the view from the gun battery on the quay head, as part of the coastal defence preparations, which stopped steamers calling at the harbour until it was cleared in 1951. In 1808 a ship, believed to be the Bristol Packet which had been built in 1801 was wrecked on Madbrain Sands.|$|E

25|$|Several {{months before}} the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of {{election}} news, as his supporters began petition drives to {{get him on the}} ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat Hamilton Jordan and Republican Ed Rollins. In July, while Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization United We Stand America. Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most of what he <b>did</b> <b>call</b> for were intended to reduce the deficit, such as a gasoline tax increase and cutbacks to Social Security.|$|E
25|$|Ulster's {{geography}} {{presented a}} formidable challenge. There were three main routes by which an invading army could enter the province, {{and all three}} favoured the defenders. Brian first {{had to find a}} means of getting through or around these defensive 'choke points', and then he had to subdue the fiercely independent regional Kings of Ulster. It took Brian ten years of campaigning to achieve his goal, which, considering that he could and <b>did</b> <b>call</b> on all of the military forces of the rest of Ireland, indicates how formidable the Kings of Ulster were. Once again, it was his coordinated use of forces on land and at sea that allowed him to triumph; while the rulers of Ulster could bring the advance of Brian's army to a halt, they could not prevent his fleet from attacking the shores of their kingdoms. Once Brian entered the province of Ulster, he systematically defeated each of the regional rulers who defied him, forcing them to recognise him as their overlord.|$|E

500|$|In mid-1910, the Wrights {{changed the}} design of the Wright Flyer, moving the {{horizontal}} elevator from the front to the back and adding wheels although keeping the skids as part of the undercarriage unit. It had become apparent by then that a rear elevator would make an airplane easier to control, especially as higher speeds grew more common. The new version was designated the [...] "Model B", although the original canard design was never referred to as the [...] "Model A" [...] by the Wrights.

500|$|Though Laffoon was {{determined}} to pass a state sales tax, he vowed not to call a special legislative session to consider the issue. However, in August 1933, he <b>did</b> <b>call</b> a special session to debate a [...] "gross receipts tax", which was essentially a sales tax by another name. Johnson and Chandler again led the opposition to Laffoon's plan; Laffoon called them, along with Allie Young and U.S. Representative John Y. Brown, Sr., [...] "the most insidious lobby that ever infected the Capitol". He reportedly further charged that opposition to his tax program was financed by [...] "a bunch of New York Jews". Despite Laffoon's rhetoric, the sales tax was again defeated.|$|E

Anderson makes particular use of sets and locations to wring out more bang for the stereoscopic buck". Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian gave the film two stars out of five praising the use of 3D, while stating that the Resident Evil films [...] "always look good and have well-staged action, but they don't have one iota of originality or imagination". Chicago Readers Andrea Gronvall described the plot as [...] "nearly indiscernible" [...] but <b>did</b> <b>call</b> the film the [...] "sleekest so far, thanks to 3D and star Milla Jovovich's body-hugging catsuit".|$|E

[...] The associate <b>did</b> <b>call</b> it [...] "a mad risk" [...] in her obituary of Collings; [...] "a book as bizarre by an unknown writer which had been turned down by the major London publishers; {{but it was also}} dazzlingly brave and intuitive." [...] Collings had little capital and could not pay an advance but [...] "he got a review copy onto every desk in London that mattered."

500|$|Another of Brownlee's {{contacts}} was T. A. Crerar, who {{had recently}} become leader of the Progressive Party of Canada, and it was to him that Brownlee turned for his political education. [...] Crerar introduced Brownlee to Ernest Charles Drury, the newly elected United Farmers of Ontario Premier of Ontario, and arranged for a meeting between Brownlee and Charles Stewart, by now Alberta Premier. [...] During the latter meeting, Brownlee told Stewart that {{he felt that the}} UFA's desires could be accommodated within Stewart's Liberal government, but warned against a quick election. [...] Foster suggests that this strategic advice from a political neophyte offended Stewart; whether this is true or not, Stewart <b>did</b> <b>call</b> a quick election, for July 1921.

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Shaunna Murphy was {{a little}} more {{critical}} of the episode, though she <b>did</b> <b>call</b> it [...] "game-changing." [...] Noting that it [...] "felt rushed," [...] she [...] "would have preferred a slow-burning mystery spread out over several episodes over this dramatic, Nikki and Paulo-style stand-alone sendoff." [...] Murphy however concluded that Graham's death was [...] "one of the coolest sequences we've seen so far on this show." [...] The A.V. Club columnist Oliver Sava graded [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] with a C. He also noted negative similarities to the television series Lost, explaining, [...] "Remember when Jack, Sawyer, and Kate were stuck in the polar-bear cages, and the plot just wandered in an aimless haze? The time when a bunch of viewers started jumping off because the writers kept adding questions without ever giving answers? What took Lost 44 episodes, OUAT has done in seven." [...] Unlike other reviewers, Sava called the ending a [...] "frustrating conclusion," [...] and believed that [...] "Horowitz and Kitsis [...] one step forward and two steps back with this development." ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{incorporated}} utopian {{themes in}} his previous works but reviewers were divided on whether The Years of Rice and Salt qualified as a utopian story. Those that <b>did</b> <b>call</b> the world described in the story as utopian cited the story's illustration of progress. However, those that wrote The Years of Rice and Salt was not a utopian story say that the world history presented is not necessarily better or worse than the real history, just different. Robinson calls himself a [...] "utopian novelist" [...] in that he claims [...] "all science fiction has a utopian element, in that it tends to say that what we do now matters and will have consequences". Several other themes were identified by reviewers. Robinson had previously used the theme of memory (or identity) and incorporates it into this story with characters who are reincarnated versions of previous characters and who only recognize each other while in the bardo, but sometimes feel a connection between themselves while on earth. The reviewer in The Globe and Mail identified feminism and [...] "struggles over the nature of Islam" [...] as recurring themes.|$|E
500|$|... "Last Day in Florida" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, {{with many of}} them praising Rainn Wilson and John Krasinski's performance in the episode and their characters' interaction. Writing for New York, Michael Tedder called the scene featuring Dwight helping Jim up [...] "eloquent" [...] and wrote that it summarized their relationship over the years. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt called the episode the [...] "most satisfying episode in the Florida arc", mainly praising the Jim-Dwight relationship, and said that since Steve Carell left the series they have become the [...] "emotional core" [...] of the show. He also complimented the writers for adding [...] "business logic" [...] to Sabre, specifically with Robert criticizing the Sabre Pyramid. Despite mainly praising the Florida plotline, {{he went on to}} criticize the Andy-Erin plotline for Erin's incompetence and also the fact he stopped caring about Andy and Erin's relationship, although he <b>did</b> <b>call</b> their video chat [...] "charming". He ultimately gave the episode a B+. Brian Marder of Hollywood.com had a mixed response to the episode and wrote that it ruined the positive momentum the previous two episodes had. He also wrote that the episode was not a good episode until the final scene of Andy telling the camera he is going to Florida to get Erin back, calling the development [...] "half intriguing, half mildly uninteresting".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, noting that Test the Store' {{was just too}} dumb to build any further momentum; I wish I had a better word for it, but I just can't think of one." [...] However, McNutt appreciated Jim's presentation, noting that [...] "the final presentation was a pretty decent setpiece." [...] What Culture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer awarded the episode three out of five stars, noting that the episode fell victim to [...] "the overall lack of focus and believability that has plagued The Office all season." [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screen Crave gave the episode a review of seven out of ten, noting that [...] "The Office continues to get the comedy boost it needs from the Florida storyline." [...] Hyatt called the scene featuring Dwight and Jim imitating Kelly and Ryan's mom as [...] "one of my favorite moments of the season so far." [...] Despite this, he <b>did</b> <b>call</b> the episode [...] "uneven," [...] noting that the Scranton story-line was [...] "ho-hum." [...] Dan Forcella from TV Fanatic awarded the episode {{four out of five}} stars and praised Jim's presentation, writing, [...] "Between Jim's outfit and makeup, the fact that he embraced the presentation throughout, and all of the Chuck references, I was speechless {{by the end of that}} thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} been {{perceived}} very positively {{in the years}} following its initial release. [...] GameDaily named it alongside the other Game Boy Final Fantasy titles as definitive games for the system, describing it as providing [...] "hours of role-playing excitement, whether you were waiting in a dentist's office or on the way to Grandma's house." [...] The sentiment was shared by gaming magazine Pocket Games, which ranked the titles together 8th out of the Top 50 games for the Game Boy, stating [...] "every game in the series is a sprawling classic with well written scripts and solid characters." [...] Kotaku praised the original release of the game as a [...] "really great action-RPG". 1UP.com called the game ambitious for its time, writing that it represented an evolution of the overhead perspective action adventure genre. They also rated the game as [...] "Worth It!" [...] in terms of buying and enjoying the original game in 2007, and noted it as the origins of the Mana series' many unique gameplay features. GamesRadar named it the 13th best Game Boy game ever made, noting that its interesting leveling system and large number of collectible items made up for a poor English translation. Game Informer also praised the game's leveling system, though it <b>did</b> <b>call</b> it a [...] "simplistic" [...] title in comparison to its sequels.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review and grade it a C+. Handlen criticized the episode's lack of resolution, noting that [...] "The show can feed our social {{paranoia}} [...] {{but when it}} comes time to deliver on all this, to finally pull back the curtain and move on to the next stage, it fumbles things." [...] Furthermore, he called the Mulder/Scully/Fowley love triangle [...] "immediately off-putting" [...] and criticized Mimi Rogers's characterization. However, Handlen <b>did</b> <b>call</b> The Smoking Man's return [...] "thrilling" [...] and wrote that the burning of Mulder's office was [...] "arguably one of the most iconic visuals in the run of the series". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two criticized the closing down of the X-Files division, due largely to the fact that [...] "we've seen [...] before", a reference to the divisions's closing at the conclusion of the show's first season. However, Shearman and Pearson wrote that [...] "'The End' works in spite of itself", citing the arrival of Diana Fowley and the confrontation between The Smoking Man and Jeffrey Spender as positive points in the episode.|$|E
