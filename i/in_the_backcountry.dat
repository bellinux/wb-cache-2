5|$|Lodging in {{the park}} is {{available}} at Zion Lodge, located halfway through Zion Canyon. Three campgrounds are available: South and Watchman at the far southern side of the park, and a primitive site at Lava Point {{in the middle of}} the park off Kolob Terrace Road. Overnight camping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry</b> requires permits.|$|E
5|$|Visitors {{are allowed}} to snowshoe and do {{cross-country}} skiing and are not restricted to trails. The Teton Park Road between the Taggart Lake trailhead to Signal Mountain Campground is closed to vehicular traffic during the winter and {{this section of the}} road is groomed for skiing and snowshoeing traffic. The park service offers guided snowshoe tours daily from the main headquarters located in Moose, Wyoming. Overnight camping is allowed in the winter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry</b> with a permit and visitors should inquire about avalanche dangers.|$|E
5|$|All campsites {{accessible}} only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites {{and they are}} available by permit only, but camping is allowed {{in most of these}} backcountry zones year-round. The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set carrying capacity of overnight stays per zone to protect the resources from overcrowding. Open fires are not permitted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry</b> and all food must be stored in an Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee approved bear-resistant container. As of 2012, only four brands of bear-resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand Teton National Park backcountry. Additionally, hikers may use an approved bear spray to elude aggressive bears.|$|E
40|$|This experiential {{workshop}} utilized various portable ropes course {{initiatives that}} could be used <b>in</b> either <b>the</b> <b>backcountry</b> or classroom environments. Participants learned how a challenge course class researched and built various portable ropes course elements for one of their projects. This session included brainstorming and active participation...|$|R
5|$|On {{the days}} after <b>the</b> pass reopens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring, <b>backcountry</b> skiers often take {{advantage}} of the remaining snow on <b>the</b> slopes. <b>In</b> years following heavy winters, skiing is possible into July.|$|R

5|$|Backcountry hiking is {{available}} in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness and the much larger Backcountry Area beyond (added in 2000). Only two trails enter the wilderness area and even those stop after a few miles or kilometers. From there most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom-visited volcanic features. All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with a ranger. No drinking water {{is available}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry</b> and the dry climate quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers. Pets, camp fires, and all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are not allowed in the wilderness area.|$|E
5|$|Among Chacoan mammals are the {{plentiful}} coyote (Canis latrans); mule deer, elk, and pronghorn also {{live within}} the canyon, though they are rarely encountered by visitors. Important smaller carnivores include bobcats, badgers, foxes, and two species of skunk. The park hosts abundant populations of rodents, including several prairie dog towns. Small colonies of bats are present during the summer. The local shortage of water means that relatively few bird species are present; these include roadrunners, large hawks (such as Cooper's hawks and American kestrels), owls, vultures, and ravens, though they are less abundant in the canyon than in the wetter mountain ranges to the east. Sizeable populations of smaller birds, including warblers, sparrows, and house finches, are also common. Three species of hummingbirds are present: one is the tiny but highly pugnacious rufous hummingbird, which compete intensely with the more mild-tempered black-chinned hummingbirds for breeding habitat in shrubs or trees located near water. Western (prairie) rattlesnakes are occasionally seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry,</b> though various lizards and skinks are far more abundant.|$|E
5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's nutcracker are found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry.</b> The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, sandhill crane and on rare occasions it's endangered relative, the whooping crane.|$|E

5|$|Underlying {{social and}} racial {{tensions}} {{also had a}} great impact {{on the nature of the}} fighting. Rural areas were pitted against urban centers, as grievances against the authorities found an outlet in the political conflict. This was the case with Hidalgo's peasant revolt, which was fueled as much by discontent over several years of bad harvests as with events in the Peninsular War. Hidalgo was originally part of a circle of liberal urbanites in Querétaro, who sought to establish a junta. After this conspiracy was discovered, Hidalgo turned to the rural people of the Mexican Bajío to build his army, and their interests soon overshadowed those of the urban intellectuals. A similar tension existed in Venezuela, where the Spanish immigrant José Tomás Boves was able to form a nearly invincible, though informal, royalist army out of the Llanero, mixed-race, slave and plains people, by seeking to destroy the white landowning class. Boves and his followers often disregarded the command of Spanish officials and were not concerned with actually reestablishing the toppled royal government, choosing instead to keep real power among themselves. Finally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry</b> of Upper Peru, the republiquetas kept the idea of independence alive by allying with disenfranchised members of rural society and Native groups, but were never able to take the major population centers. This period witnessed increasingly violent confrontations between Spaniards and Spanish Americans, but this tension was often related to class issues or fomented by patriot leaders to create a new sense of nationalism. After being incited to rid the country of the gachupines (a disparaging term for Peninsulares), Hidalgo's forces indiscriminately massacred hundreds of Criollos and Peninsulares who had taken refuge at the Alhóndiga de Granaditas in Guanajuato. In Venezuela during his Admirable Campaign, Simón Bolívar instituted a policy of a war to the death—in which and royalist Spanish Americans would be purposely spared but even neutral Peninsulares would be killed—in order to drive a wedge between the two groups. This policy laid the ground for the violent royalist reaction under Boves. Often though, royalism or patriotism simply provided a banner to organize the aggrieved, and the political causes could be discarded just as quickly as they were picked up. The Venezuelan Llaneros switched to the patriot banner once the elites and the urban centers became securely royalist after 1815, and it was the royal army in Mexico that ultimately brought about that nation's independence.|$|E
25|$|The early colonists {{engaged in}} warfare, trade, and {{cultural}} exchanges. Those living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry</b> {{were more likely}} to encounter Creek Indians, Cherokee, and Choctaws and other regional native groups.|$|E
25|$|They settled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry</b> {{throughout}} the South and relied on subsistence farming. Mostly {{they did not}} own slaves. Given the differences in background, class, slave holding, economics, and culture, there was long-standing competition between the Low Country and back country that played out in politics.|$|E

50|$|Camping is {{a popular}} form of {{recreation}} which often {{involves the use of}} tents. A tent is economical and practical because of its portability and low environmental impact. These qualities are necessary when used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wilderness or <b>backcountry.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also {{worthy of}} note is that the Fort housed an {{undisclosed}} number of Prisoners-of-War.

25|$|The late 1800s {{and early}} 1900s in the Mississippi Delta showed both {{frontier}} influence and actions directed at repressing African Americans. After the Civil War, 90% of the Delta was still undeveloped. Both whites and African Americans migrated {{there for a}} chance to buy land <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry.</b> It was frontier wilderness, heavily forested and without roads for years. Before the start of the 20th century, lynchings often took the form of frontier justice directed at transient workers as well as residents.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Chesapeake Bay settlements, colonial {{officials}} found it difficult to attract and retain laborers under the harsh frontier conditions, and there was a high mortality rate. Most laborers came from Britain as indentured servants, having signed contracts of indenture to pay with work for their passage, their upkeep and training, usually on a farm. The colonies had agricultural economies. These indentured servants were young people who intended to become permanent residents. In some cases, convicted criminals were transported to the colonies as indentured servants, rather than being imprisoned. The indentured servants were not slaves, but were required to work for four to seven years in Virginia to pay the cost of their passage and maintenance. Many Germans, Scots-Irish, and Irish came to the colonies in the 18th century, settling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry</b> of Pennsylvania and further south.|$|E
2500|$|Sessions for the Kanik {{program are}} {{available}} from December 28 to March 31. Between Christmas and New Years Day a special discounted holiday trek is offered. Weather conditions vary; if there is adequate snow for cross-country skiing, then crews are {{given the opportunity to}} hike <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Philmont <b>backcountry.</b> [...] <b>The</b> program allows for weekend treks, however, Philmont recommends that crews plan to attend for 3 to 4 days to become fully trained and fully participate in winter activities. [...] Crew sizes usually range from 6-10 with 2 adult advisors required to participate. [...] Generally, the maximum number of total participants for each session is limited to 40 participants or 4 crews; unlike the several thousand participants during Philmont's summer season.

25|$|Upon {{arrival in}} North America, these {{migrants}} at first usually identified simply as Irish, without the qualifier Scotch. It {{was not until}} a century later, following the surge in Irish immigration after the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s, that {{the descendants of the}} earlier arrivals began to commonly call themselves Scotch-Irish to distinguish themselves from the newer, predominantly Roman Catholic and poor immigrants; these largely had no Scottish ancestry. At first, the two groups had little interaction in America, as the Scots-Irish had become settled decades earlier, primarily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry</b> of the Appalachian region. The new wave of Irish families settled primarily in port cities such as Boston, New York, Chicago, and New Orleans, where large immigrant communities formed and there were an increasing number of industrial jobs. Many of the new Irish migrants also went to the interior in the 19th century, attracted to jobs on large-scale infrastructure projects such as canals and railroads.|$|E
500|$|Campbell started {{recruiting}} Loyalists. [...] By February 10, 1779, about 1,100 men signed up, {{but relatively}} few actually formed militia companies, forming only 20 companies of the British Army. [...] Campbell then began requiring oaths of loyalty, on pain of forfeiture of property; many took this oath insincerely, quickly letting Williamson know their true feelings. [...] Early in his march, Campbell dispatched Major John Hamilton to recruit Loyalists in Wilkes County and Lt. Colonel John Boyd on {{an expedition to}} raise Loyalists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry</b> of North and South Carolina. [...] Boyd met with success and recruited several hundred men. [...] As he traveled south back toward Augusta, more Loyalists joined his company until it numbered over 600 men in central South Carolina. [...] As this column moved on, the men plundered and pillaged along the way, predictably drawing angered Patriots to take up arms.|$|E
500|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{a popular}} {{destination}} for mountain and rock climbers partly because the mountains are easily accessible by road. Trails are well marked and routes to the summits of most peaks are long established, and for the experienced and fit, most peaks can be climbed in one day. The highest maintained trails climb {{from the floor of}} Jackson Hole over [...] to mountain passes that are sometimes called saddles or divides. From these passes, the climbs follow routes that require varying skill levels. Climbers do not need a permit but are encouraged to voluntarily register their climbing plans with the National Park Service and inform associates of their itinerary. Any climb requiring an overnight stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry</b> does require a permit. Climbers are essentially on their own to determine their own skill levels and are encouraged to not take unnecessary risks. The Exum Mountain Guides, which {{is considered one of the}} finest mountaineering guide services in the U.S., as well as the Jackson Hole Mountain Guides, offer instruction and climbing escorts for those who are less experienced or unfamiliar with various routes.|$|E
2500|$|Canyoneering, bouldering, bushwhacking and rappelling {{are often}} {{necessary}} to explore parts of <b>the</b> <b>backcountry</b> without developed trails. A notably challenging route is down Enchanted Gorge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle Fork <b>backcountry,</b> where Disappearing Creek vanishes under huge talus piles only to re-emerge several miles downstream, hence the name. Nearby Goddard Canyon is an easier – albeit still rugged – route, {{and is known}} for its scenic meadows and many waterfalls. The Gorge of Despair above Tehipite Valley {{is known for its}} combination of cliffs, waterfalls and deep pools, whose [...] descent requires rappelling gear and wetsuits to achieve. Because of the park's size, lack of cell reception and limited personnel for search and rescue operations, only experienced cross-country travelers should attempt to hike off trail.|$|R

500|$|At least 700 {{grizzly bears}} are {{believed}} {{to exist in the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which includes Shoshone National Forest, with approximately 125 grizzlies in the forest. The grizzly is listed as a threatened species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the forest is one of their last strongholds. For what are considered to be [...] "nuisance bears", non-lethal traps are set to capture them {{so that they can be}} relocated to remote areas, away from civilization. In the case of the grizzly, each captured bear is tranquilized and then ear tagged with an identifying number. Each number is registered, and if the bear continues to return to areas where they pose a risk of imminent threat to human safety, they are exterminated. The grizzly recovery efforts implemented by federal agencies have often resulted in major disagreements with local landowners and surrounding municipalities. This situation occurs less frequently with the smaller and less aggressive black bear. An active management program, in conjunction with other National Forests and National Parks within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, works cooperatively to maximize human safety and to ensure habitat protection for both species of endemic bears. Visitors are mandated to store their food in their vehicles or in steel containers found in campgrounds, and bear-proof trash receptacles are located in the front-country zones throughout the forest. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>backcountry,</b> food must be stored some distance from campsites, and other related precautions are enforced to help prevent bad encounters.|$|E
