New York magazine contributor Mark Graham said this episode of 30 Rock saw the series [...] "once again hitting a familiar, meta-flavored stride, as Tina Fey and her writing staff tried a 'ripped from the headlines' approach and took on recent real-life story lines like the 30 Rock porno". [...] "The return of Will Arnett, the existence of a Porn Liz, and one <b>deal</b> <b>breaker</b> after another: 'Into the Crevasse' had some killer lines, even if it didn't come together in one big narrative", remarked Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly.

5000|$|The Soviet {{policy of}} favoring one Arab group often drove the others towards the west, {{as seen by}} the {{increased}} favoritism towards Iraq and Syria which served to push Egypt, along with Saudi Arabia back into Western graces as a former Soviet exploited state. The Soviets use their stick and carrot approach to bully the Arabs into joining their sphere, however the Arab League keeps closer ties using religion {{than that of the}} atheist Soviets. The Soviets also become their own worst enemies when they invade Afghanistan and initially support both Iran and Iraq during their war in the early 1980s, before switching sides and only supporting the Iranians. Moscow has initial great gains in Arabia, but through their own missteps, and lackluster polices, they lose diplomatic trust with their invasion of Afghanistan, and later their support of Iran being the <b>deal</b> <b>breakers</b> causing them to loose diplomatic respect of the Arabs and push them further into alliances with the West.|$|R

Liz gets the chance to be on camera as host of Dealbreakers, but the pilot is a failure.

40|$|Food systems {{around the}} world {{experienced}} increased merger and acquisition (M&A) activity over the past decades. Based on a sample of 13, 911 M&A attempts worldwide during 1986 - 2006, this study provides an analysis of major determinants of M&A completion in the food processing industry. Friendly attitude, cash payment and experience with M&As emerge as strong deal facilitators. Bidding competition, pursuit of parallel transactions, target subsidiary status and acquirer public status {{are the most important}} <b>deal</b> <b>breakers.</b> Unlike the lenient antitrust approach of the Reagan administration, the 1998 UK Competition Act and various directives and regulations on food safety and quality associated with the completion of the internal European market in 1992 facilitated M&A completion. In contrast, the beginning of the Economic and Monetary Union, as marked by the introduction of the Euro in 1999, had a strong negative effect on completion likelihood. This study identifies substantial regional differences. Completion of M&As that involve Asian firms depends on distinct factors.

40|$|Growing {{numbers of}} {{decision}} makers {{are becoming more}} open to charging users of roads to fund transportation improvements, including transit alternatives. Despite significant progress, planners and policy makers still face many obstacles when considering road-pricing projects. This suggests {{that many of the}} factors that determine {{the success or failure of}} such proposed projects are not well understood and that proposed projects may include one or more aspects that prove to be <b>deal</b> <b>breakers</b> for key supporters. Four geographically diverse California road-pricing projects were selected for detailed case studies. Two projects that succeeded to implementation allow for an analysis of the critical political maneuvers made throughout the life of these priced facilities. One project that was ultimately halted in the later stages of planning and one planned but not yet implemented project are useful in evaluating what went wrong and what lessons can be drawn from these attempts to implement road pricing. The findings suggest that there are numerous ways to adjust pricing projects to gain public and political support. Generally, projects should try to provide more capacity, travel-time savings, and travel options, and avoid pricing facilities that have no free alternatives. Nevertheless, the manner in which projects are designated and revenues are used is highly context-specific, and some concessions in one area can improve acceptability in another. The future of road pricing is uncertain, and pricing projects should be considered only on a case-by-case basis, depending on local attitudes, the use of the revenue generated, and the specific facility in question...|$|R

40|$|Nations feel an {{obligation}} to provide-indeed, a nation 2 ̆ 7 s citizens may demand-protection for their 2 ̆ 2 cultural property 2 ̆ 2 : the works of art or architecture, religious or historical artifacts, or other physical embodiments of a nation 2 ̆ 7 s cultural output. When, however, such property is transported abroad, reclaiming the property may be difficult, at best, and all but impossible by nonviolent means, at worst. This Comment proposes a framework for a new international treaty governing both the treatment of cultural property {{and the creation of}} an international body to resolve disputes and promote the protection of cultural property. This is not a new goal, of course, but the Comment 2 ̆ 7 s main contention is {{that it is possible to}} resolve the conflicts that have prevented past efforts in this regard from achieving meaningful success. In order to understand, much less resolve, the challenges inherent to this undertaking, a good deal of background is necessary. The term 2 ̆ 2 cultural property 2 ̆ 2 is difficult to define and the concept has a substantial history, so Section I briefly discusses this topic. Additionally, the challenges facing any international agreement regarding cultural property in the proposal, ratification, and application stages are legion, and numerous such challenges have proven their capacity as 2 ̆ 2 <b>deal</b> <b>breakers,</b> 2 ̆ 2 so these problems will be examined in Section II. A number of proposed agreements have been adopted or have fallen short of meaningful adoption; there is agreement that none of these proposals is adequate, so an examination of these failed proposals is prerequisite to understanding the reasons why proposed agreements obtain ratification or fail. Sections III and IV examine these historical agreements and various proposals. Section V proposes the framework for a new, comprehensive solution to international cultural-property disputes. Finally, Section VI offers conclusions about the potential for implementing, either in whole or in part, the Comment 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations. [CONT...|$|R

40|$|While {{several studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that there is a relative price difference between companies listed on the stock market and privately held enterprises, no academic study has addressed the question of how this private enterprise discount can be reduced and the proceeds from a divestment can be maximized. This research project has focused on the seller’s perspective in the takeover process in order to answer the following research question: What factors influence the ability of sellers to extract value when divesting a privately held target and how can these factors be optimized? Based on the existing knowledge base, the following key success factors have been determined to be the main elements of the divestment process to be studied: Increasing negotiation power by creating competition; Initiating the sales process under favourable market conditions; Selecting a group of bidders with the highest potential synergies; Inviting financial investors to the bidding process; Increasing transparency of target company information; Controlling information dissemination to potential bidders; Articulating a compelling value and growth story for each buyer; Optimizing the auction process used in the divestment; Overcoming price differences using deferred or conditional payments; and identifying and mitigating potential <b>deal</b> <b>breakers.</b> Typically, M&A advisors are hired by the owners of privately held companies {{in order to create a}} market for their illiquid asset. A survey-based study validating the perceived importance of the key success factors has been conducted in addition to multiple case studies, where specialized M&A advisors and their clients have participated. The study of five selected cases involving a privately held target company during and after the divestment process has produced results with high significance to other researchers and professionals involved in mergers and acquisitions. From multiple case studies, the best possible practices regarding the optimization of the key success factors has been derived and used to reappraise the existing knowledge base. While based on a systematic analysis of the data obtained, the research question has been answered, further studies with a larger sample will be necessary to generalize findings and to validate the theory developed...|$|R
