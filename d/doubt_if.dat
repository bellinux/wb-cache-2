5|$|The abscess in {{my ankle}} was painful and persistent.... Owing to faulty {{treatment}} and want of rest my ankle became perfectly stiff, {{as it is}} to this day. Of course, I said as little as possible about it, for even partial lameness would spoil my chances on the stage. I <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and those who saw me dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the pain I often suffered.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{addition}} of a second NASCAR weekend at the track in 2004, attendance at the races dropped off dramatically, by as much as 20,000. With such a large attendance swing, drivers and media began to <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> the track deserved two dates, even if the track was near Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest media market. Weather also became a concern with either extremely hot days or with rain threatening the races. All of this factored into NASCAR's decision to remove a second race from the track with the realignment of the 2011 NASCAR schedule. Former track owner Roger Penske said the track may be located in a one-race market. Track president Gillian Zucker cited bad weather windows and fans having other entertainment options as reasons for the attendance decline.|$|E
25|$|Burden of production: P has to {{show some}} {{evidence}} that D had committed murder. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution requires enough evidence to justify a rational trier of fact to find guilt beyond a reasonable <b>doubt.</b> <b>If</b> the judge rules that such burden has been met, then {{it is up to}} the jury itself to decide if they are, in fact, convinced of guilty beyond a reasonable <b>doubt.</b> <b>If</b> the judge finds there is not enough evidence under the standard, the case must be dismissed (or a subsequent guilty verdict must be vacated and the charges dismissed).|$|E
60|$|Yeovil privately <b>doubted</b> <b>if</b> he {{ever heard}} {{anything}} {{but his own}} opinions.|$|R
60|$|<b>Doubting</b> <b>if</b> he {{had chosen}} a {{convenient}} time for his visit, Mr. Rayburn hesitated.|$|R
60|$|Thorn pondered. Gerald's {{statement}} was plausible, but he <b>doubted</b> <b>if</b> {{he had told}} him all.|$|R
25|$|At {{the borders}} of the Muisca territories, the leaders {{organised}} fortifications of guecha warriors to defend their terrain. Although on the presence of a stone fortress in Cajicá there is serious <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> it existed in pre-conquest times, fortifications around the Confederation have been described.|$|E
25|$|The Meditator {{reasons that}} he need only find {{some reason to}} doubt his present {{opinions}} in order to prompt him to seek sturdier foundations for knowledge. Rather than doubt {{every one of his}} opinions individually, he reasons that he might cast them all into <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> he can doubt the foundations and basic principles on which the opinions are founded.|$|E
25|$|Bale {{attended}} Whitchurch High School in Cardiff. He was a keen {{athlete and}} played football alongside future Wales rugby captain Sam Warburton, rugby, hockey and excelled at athletics. As a 14-year-old {{he says that}} he ran the 100-metre sprint in 11.4 seconds. Because of his superior footballing skill, the school's PE teacher, Gwyn Morris, had to write special rules which restricted Bale to playing one-touch football and not using his left foot. Whilst at Whitchurch, Bale trained at Southampton's satellite academy in Bath, although there was initially some <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> Southampton would give him a scholarship due to his height.|$|E
60|$|Kit thanked him, and then, {{looking at}} the man thoughtfully, added that he <b>doubted</b> <b>if</b> the things would fit.|$|R
60|$|Kit did {{not know}} much about young women, but hesitated, because he <b>doubted</b> <b>if</b> {{she wanted him to}} post the letter.|$|R
50|$|The {{campaign}} {{was created by}} Tor Myhren, then of Grey Global Group. At first, Myhren had <b>doubts</b> <b>if</b> the ad campaign would work.|$|R
25|$|Around {{this same}} time reports {{surfaced}} in the media suggesting that Oman, {{which is the only}} Middle Eastern Monarchy not taking part in the coalition and has a border with Yemen, has presented a 7-point plan to both Iran and Saudi Arabia. Oman has played a vital role as a bridge between Tehran and the West in the past to help in the nuclear negotiations and thus enjoys good relations with Iran as well as its GCC neighbors. It has also been suggested that Oman was responsible to mediate a 24-hour ceasefire although analysts <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> Oman can help bring about more rigid negotiations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the country}} districts, {{as has been}} stated, the magistri pagorum had {{authority}} to maintain the viae vicinales. In Rome itself each householder was legally responsible for the repairs to {{that portion of the}} street which passed his own house. It was the duty of the aediles to enforce this responsibility. The portion of any street which passed a temple or public building was repaired by the aediles at the public expense. When a street passed between a public building or temple and a private house, the public treasury and the private owner shared the expense equally. No <b>doubt,</b> <b>if</b> only to secure uniformity, the personal liability of householders to execute repairs of the streets was commuted for a paving rate payable to the public authorities who were responsible from time to time.|$|E
25|$|I {{think it}} may be taken that we owe the sailors' working song as we now possess it to the Americans. How far do these songs date back? I <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> the most ancient amongst them is much older than the century. It is {{noteworthy}} that the old voyagers do not hint at the sailors singing out or encouraging their efforts by choruses when at work. In the navy, of course, this sort of song was never permitted. Work proceeded to the strains of a fiddle, to the piping of the boatswain and his mates, or in earlier times yet, to the trumpet. The working song then is peculiar to the Merchant Service, but one may hunt through the old chronicles without encountering a suggestion of its existence prior to American independence and to the establishment of a Yankee marine.|$|E
6000|$|... "But how are {{you going}} to work without money?" [...] asked Ralph, almost <b>doubting</b> <b>if</b> his {{companion}} was quite right in his mind.|$|R
60|$|Mabel frowned. She saw {{where her}} lover's remark led, but <b>doubted</b> <b>if</b> the others did. She forced a laugh when Wyndham looked round.|$|R
60|$|Lister studied her. He <b>doubted</b> <b>if</b> it was {{altogether}} exertion {{that had}} brought the blood to her skin and given her eyes the keen sparkle. Clinging to the rock, with the shadowy gulf below, she looked strangely alert and virile. Her figure cut against the sky; he noted its slenderness and finely-drawn lines. She was not angry, although he had admitted he pushed down the stone, but {{he felt as if}} something divided them and <b>doubted</b> <b>if</b> he could remove the obstacle.|$|R
500|$|In 1982 the {{orchestra}} celebrated its golden jubilee. At the anniversary concert Solti conducted the programme with which Beecham had inaugurated the LPO. Pirouet comments {{that with the}} exception of Delius's Brigg Fair, the music was as ideally suited to Solti's musical persona as to Beecham's. In The Guardian, Edward Greenfield wrote, [...] "I <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> the LPO has ever played so beautifully, even in the days of Beecham".|$|E
500|$|In mid-1949, Nixon, {{although}} {{anxious to}} advance his political career, {{was reluctant to}} run for the Senate unless he was confident of winning the Republican primary. He considered his party's prospects in the House to be bleak, absent a strong Republican trend, and wrote [...] "I seriously <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> we can ever work our way back in power. Actually, in my mind, I do not see any great gain in remaining a member of the House, even from a relatively good District, if it means we would be simply a vocal but ineffective minority." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{his return}} from the Middle East, Jackson was briefly an {{instructor}} at No.1 Service Flying Training School, based at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria. He wrote to his wife, [...] "I just loathe this joint. This training is a tough job and I take my hat off to the boys who {{have been doing it}} since war broke out... every one of these instructors is longing to be sent overseas, but I <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> they have any chance of ever getting there—they are so valuable here." [...] In January 1942, he was posted to No.4 Squadron, which operated Wirraways in Canberra.|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} {{book of the}} novel Crash, Elaman has some <b>doubts</b> <b>if</b> the {{principles}} of the future communist society agitated by Commissioner Diakov are faithful.|$|R
5000|$|Reception was mixed. The series drew several {{comments}} {{over its}} nude scenes and sexual references. Some <b>doubted</b> <b>if</b> Sartre could {{or should be}} adapted for television ...|$|R

500|$|In 1906 O. C. Simonds a {{well-known}} prairie school landscape architect was hired, he simplified the road system, planned walks and planting areas. It was Sidmons who first described this area around West Circle Drive as a [...] "sacred space" [...] and who reaffirmed {{the idea of}} as area of campus as a park {{to be protected from}} development. In a 1906 letter to the Board for Trustee's [...] "This area is, I am sure, that feature of the College which is most pleasantly and affectionately remembered by the students after they leave their Alma Mater, and I <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> any instruction given has a greater effect upon their lives." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{substance}} of Shaw's political legacy is uncertain. In 1921 Shaw's erstwhile collaborator William Archer, {{in a letter}} to the playwright, wrote: [...] "I <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> there is any case of a man so widely read, heard, seen, and known as yourself, who has produced so little effect on his generation." [...] Margaret Cole, who considered Shaw the greatest writer of his age, professed never to have understood him. She thought he worked [...] "immensely hard" [...] at politics, but essentially, she surmises, it was for fun—"the fun of a brilliant artist". After Shaw's death, Pearson wrote: [...] "No one since the time of Tom Paine has had so definite an influence on the social and political life of his time and country as Bernard Shaw." ...|$|E
500|$|The other gambit, 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 f6 7.exf6 Qxf6, is much riskier, as Black weakens his kingside {{and does}} not open a {{diagonal}} for his Bc8. Black tries {{to take advantage of}} the fact White has moved his dark-squared bishop away from the queenside, leaving the b2-pawn without protection. The correct plan for White was shown by Gleizerov who played 8.e3 Qxb2 9.Be2 d6 10.0-0 0-0 11.Nb3 Qf6 12.c5! to open the a2–g8 diagonal that was weakened precisely by the gambit move 6...f6. The move 11.Nb3 is not only useful to support the c4–c5 push, but also to exchange the knight against Black's dark-squared bishop after a possible a2–a3 forcing the retreat Bb4–c5. As Lalic puts it, [...] "I <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> Black has a satisfactory answer to White's play in this game".|$|E
6000|$|... "I have my <b>doubts</b> <b>if</b> it will {{be carried}} out," [...] said Longways. [...] "If they are getting it up they are keeping it mighty close.|$|R
6000|$|Deering rather <b>doubted</b> <b>if</b> Jardine's cutting {{his foot}} {{accounted}} for all, but he said, [...] "Let's talk straight! I suppose Miss Margaret {{is going to}} marry Leyland?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{examination}} was over, though I <b>doubted</b> <b>if</b> the Coroner {{was entirely}} satisfied with it. I think {{he suspected that}} Mary Cavendish could tell more if she chose.|$|R
500|$|Toivonen {{was known}} as a {{competitive}} driver both on loose (gravel, dirt, sand, snow and ice) and tarmac surfaces, and he found it difficult to choose between circuit racing and rallying. After becoming a rally driver, he still competed in some circuit racing events, successfully in two World Sportscar Championship events and also in a few races for Eddie Jordan's British Formula Three Championship team. Jordan called Toivonen's performances [...] "incredible" [...] and compared him to Ayrton Senna. After Toivonen's death, Jordan weighed in on his chances in Formula One: [...] "I don't know if he would have become a champion in Formula One. It always takes a lot of luck, and now [...] one can <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> he would have been granted that. But he would have won Grands Prix– of that I'm absolutely sure." ...|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{began to}} play out {{on-screen}} in February 2011, describing how it starts to develop and the effects it has on Gilly, {{a spokesperson for the}} serial told Inside Soap: [...] "She runs into Gilly who's also got relationship problems,. The drink starts to flow, and one thing leads to another... Gilly consumed with guilt over sleeping with his best friend's girlfriend, it doesn't help that Jacqui leaves Gilly's place while he's asleep - and runs into Rhys. But after Gilly wakes up, he knows he has to tell his mate what he's done. When Gilly confesses, Rhys is both furious and hurt, and lashes out violently. [...] Once he's confronted Gilly, he demands an explanation from Jacqui - and is stunned when she tells him she was actually raped, it's absolutely devastating." [...] The storyline later takes another turn when Gilly confronts Jacqui in the village with everyone watching, leading everyone to <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> he did commit the act or not.|$|E
500|$|Setting {{the opera}} in Japan, an exotic locale {{far away from}} Britain, allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British {{politics}} and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings. Gilbert wrote, [...] "The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution." [...] G. K. Chesterton compared it to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels: [...] "Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, exactly as Swift did... I <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> {{there is a single}} joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the jokes in the play fit the English. ... About England Pooh-bah is something more than a satire; he is the truth." [...] Several of the later operas are similarly set in foreign or fictional locales, including The Gondoliers, Utopia Limited, and The Grand Duke.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oneida?" [...] demanded Fuller, {{while he}} <b>doubted</b> <b>if</b> any young warrior of that half-subdued tribe could retain so {{completely}} {{the air and}} mien of the great forests and distant prairies.|$|R
