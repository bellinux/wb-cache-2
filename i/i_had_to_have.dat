25|$|So I {{wrote this}} song that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, left me a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a scapegoat.|$|E

During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied {{by a group of}} her peers who mistook her for an effeminate, scrawny boy. [...] "I was wearing an old Salvation Army shop boy’s suit. As I went to the {{bathroom}} I heard people saying, ‘Hey, faggot’. They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick the shit out of me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> stitches. The school kicked me out, not the bullies... Years later, I went to a coffee shop and I ran into one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?’ And I said, ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade you beat up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. And I said, ‘That was me. Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E

I think Michel Gondry is very talented and I had hoped it would work. But I think Seth Rogen and Michel had a different direction for the character totally than the way I wanted to go. ... I wasn't interested in just being straight-up bad guy who was killing people willy-nilly. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some humanity and try to give it something where you could understand why the character was the way he was.

2500|$|On 22 May 1965, Arneil {{became the}} first person to {{complete}} the 100-man kumite after Oyama himself. The 100-man kumite took him around 2 hours and 45 minutes to complete, with each round scheduled to take 1 minute and 30 seconds (but a round ended if he managed to knock down his opponent). In an interview in 2005, Arneil said, [...] "I did not have to beat everyone I fought, that would have been ridiculous! I just had to keep going, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the spirit not to give up, no matter what they threw at me." [...] On 10 July 1965, Arneil was promoted to 3rd dan.|$|E
2500|$|To {{signify the}} character's 8 years living in America, Johnson was {{required}} to use an American accent while playing Vicki. She was given a voice coach and a sheet of American phrases to practice weekly. She commented, [...] "It is hard work, but it's becoming second nature now. As soon as I know that I'm Vicki, the accent just comes with it." [...] After 6 months in the role, Vicki dropped the American accent. Johnson explained {{the reason for the}} change in 2004: [...] "The producers knew that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an American accent when I came into the show because my character had been living in America but it's not the kind of accent that you'd want to have for a long time on a show like EastEnders. It's not something that's going to fit in {{for a long period of}} time. What would have been perfect would have been to have it gradually fade out, but as you film 8 episodes at a time, this would be nigh on impossible. The decision was made that in the story Vicki was coming to terms with the fact that she wanted to live in London so therefore she was going to make a conscious effort to fit in with everyone around her and blend in with London life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Volney Mathison (chiropractor, radio engineer, psychologist, and hypnotist) {{built an}} EDA meter {{based on a}} Wheatstone bridge, a vacuum tube amplifier, and a large moving-coil meter that {{projected}} {{an image of the}} needle on the wall. He patented his device in 1954 as an electropsychometer or E-meter, and it {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Mathison Electropsychometer". In Mathison's words, the E-meter [...] "has a needle that swings back and forth across a scale when a patient holds on to two electrical contacts". Mathison recorded in his book, Electropsychometry, that the idea of the E-meter came to him in 1950 while listening to a lecture by L. Ron Hubbard:p.64In 1950 ... I next attended a series of lectures being given by a very controversial figure, who several times emphasized that perhaps the major problem of psychotherapy was the difficulty of maintaining the communication of accurate or valid data from the patient to the therapist. ... it appeared to me that the psychogalvanometer showed most promise.L. Ron Hubbard told of that encounter in a 1952 recorded lecture:This machine, the electropsychometer, has been acting as a pilot since about the first of January 1952. Very early I wanted a pilot; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some method of metering preclears which was not dependent at all upon opinion or judgment. And I went out and looked at the existing lie detector equipment and I could not find anything which would do a job of work. Now, Volney Mathison out on the Coast heard a talk out there one day, and I mentioned this fact. ... I had one of the fanciest electroencephalographs made and it didn’t do anything very much, police detectors didn’t do anything very much, and Mathison went to work and he floated a current within a current. This machine is relatively simple, but it’s a current floating inside another current [...]. And I am, by the way, very much indebted to Mathison just on this basis of all of a sudden having a pilot.Mathison began working with Hubbard in 1951 and that year filed application for his first E-meter patent, [...] [...] After the partnership broke up in 1954, Mathison continued improving his E-meters with additional patents ( [...] , [...] ), marketing them through his own company and publications, retaining many of the concepts and terms from his time with Hubbard.|$|E
