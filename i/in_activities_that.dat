5|$|Important {{elements}} of traditional Scouting have their origins in Baden-Powell's experiences {{in education and}} military training. He was a 50-year-old retired army general when he founded Scouting, and his revolutionary ideas inspired thousands of young people, {{from all parts of}} society, to get involved <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> most had never contemplated. Comparable organizations in the English-speaking world are the Boys' Brigade and the non-militaristic Woodcraft Folk; however, they never matched the development and growth of Scouting.|$|E
5|$|The prince found {{fulfillment}} <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> required physical skills, {{rather than}} in the classroom. At his father's Santa Cruz farm, Pedro trained unbroken horses, and became a fine horseman and an excellent farrier. He and his brother Miguel enjoyed mounted hunts over unfamiliar ground, through forests, and even at night or in inclement weather. He displayed a talent for drawing and handicrafts, applying himself to wood carving and furniture making. In addition, he had a taste for music, and under the guidance of Marcos Portugal the prince became an able composer. He had a good singing voice, and was proficient with several musical instruments (including piano, flute and guitar), playing popular songs and dances. Pedro was a simple man, both in habits and in dealing with others. Except on solemn occasions when he donned court dress, his daily attire consisted of white cotton trousers, striped cotton jacket and a broad-brimmed straw hat, or a frock coat and a top hat in more formal situations. He would frequently take time to engage in conversation with people on the street, noting their concerns.|$|E

25|$|With the {{continued}} colonisation of the West Indies by the British Empire came {{the adoption of}} many British ideals and activities by many African slaves and their descendants. This adoption was a consequence of constant positive reinforcement from their masters for participating <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> were familiar such as cricket, and abstaining from those that were perceived as taboo. Eventually, slaves were granted permission to play with military officials, who at one point only played cricket amongst themselves, in restricted roles.

25|$|Extraversion is {{the state}} of {{primarily}} obtaining gratification from outside oneself.

They also tend to work well in groups. An extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent alone.

25|$|The Rayado {{program is}} a select, strenuous twenty-one day backpacking program {{designed}} for experienced Scouts. Rayado crews are accompanied by two rangers and experience a number of challenges geared toward developing personal growth, a sense of stewardship for the environment, and leadership skills. Rayado participants are challenged physically, mentally, and spiritually as they hike Philmont's most challenging trails, visit parts of the backcountry that are never seen by regular trek participants, and take part <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> are not available to other Scouts. This includes difficult rock climbing and instruction in outdoor leadership, wilderness problem-solving, and advanced outdoor skills which include wilderness backpacking, navigation and travel, expedition behavior and group dynamics, advanced cooking, wilderness stewardship, and wilderness first aid and backcountry emergency procedures. A Rayado Trek encourages personal growth, teamwork, and leadership ability.|$|E
25|$|Sponsors and sponsees {{participate}} <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> lead {{to spiritual}} growth. Experiences {{in the program}} are often shared by outgoing members with incoming members. This rotation of experience is often considered {{to have a great}} spiritual reward. These may include practices such as literature discussion and study, meditation, and writing. Completing the program usually implies competency to guide newcomers which is often encouraged. Sponsees typically do their Fifth Step, review their moral inventory written as part of the Fourth Step, with their sponsor. The Fifth Step, as well as the Ninth Step, have been compared to confession and penitence. Michel Foucault, a French philosopher, noted such practices produce intrinsic modifications in the person—exonerating, redeeming and purifying them; relieves them of their burden of wrong, liberating them and promising salvation.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{respiration}} {{is limited}} by the process of diffusion. Plants take in carbon dioxide through holes, known as stomata, that can open and close on the undersides of their leaves and sometimes other parts of their anatomy. Most plants require some oxygen for catabolic processes (break-down reactions that release energy). But the quantity of O2 used per hour is small as they are not involved <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> require high rates of aerobic metabolism. Their requirement for air, however, is very high as they need CO2 for photosynthesis, which constitutes only 0.04% of the environmental air. Thus, to make 1g of glucose requires the removal of all the CO2 from at least 18.7liters of air at sea level. But inefficiencies in the photosynthetic process cause considerably greater volumes of air to be used.|$|E

40|$|What {{aspects of}} {{movement}} {{are represented in}} the primary motor cortex (M 1) : relatively low-level parameters like muscle force, or more abstract parameters like handpath? To examine this issue, the <b>activity</b> of neurons <b>in</b> M 1 was recorded in a monkey trained to perform a task that dissociates three major variables of wrist movement: muscle activity, direction of movement at the wrist joint, and direction of movement in space. A substantial group of neurons in M 1 (28 out of 88) displayed changes <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> were muscle-like. Unexpectedly, an even larger group of neurons in M 1 (44 out of 88) displayed changes <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> {{were related to the}} direction of wrist movement in space independent of the pattern of muscle <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> generated the movement. Thus, both “muscles ” and “movements ” appear to be strongly represented in M 1.

25|$|The {{cause is}} not known. There {{appear to be}} some genetic {{components}} with identical twins more often affected than non-identical twins. Cultural factors also appear {{to play a role}} with societies that value thinness having higher rates of disease. Additionally, it occurs more commonly among those involved <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> value thinness such as high-level athletics, modelling, and dancing. Anorexia often begins following a major life-change or stress-inducing event. The diagnosis requires a significantly low weight. The severity of disease is based on body mass index (BMI) in adults with mild disease having a BMI of greater than 17, moderate a BMI of 16 to 17, severe a BMI of 15 to 16, and extreme a BMI less than 15. In children a BMI for age percentile of less than the 5th percentile is often used.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack {{is a recent}} innovation, invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, {{who went on to}} found Lowe Alpine and Lowepro, companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment. An internal-frame pack has a large fabric section around an {{internal frame}} composed of strips of either aluminum, titanium or plastic, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. A complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The internal frame permits the pack to fit closely to the wearer's back and minimizes shifting of the load, which is desirable when participating <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> involve upper-body movement such as scrambling over rocky surfaces and skiing. However, the tight fit reduces ventilation, so these type of packs tend to be more sweaty than external frame packs. The internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment; a few lash points (including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items) may be present, but as the frame is completely integrated, it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the pack. Internal frame packs originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking, but newer models have improved greatly in these respects. In addition, because of their snug fit, the improved internal frame models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities.|$|E
