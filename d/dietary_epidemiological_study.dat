40|$|Polyphenols are {{plant food}} microconstituents that are widely {{distributed}} in the human diet, with fruits and fruit-derived products {{as one of the}} main <b>dietary</b> sources. <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> have shown an inverse relationship between the intake of different classes of polyphenols and the risk of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. These compounds have been associated with the promotion of cardiovascular health as evidenced by clinical studies reporting beneficial effects of polyphenol-rich fruit consumption on intermediate markers of cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, animal and in vitro studies have indicated positive roles of polyphenols in preventing dysfunctions associated with the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanisms of action underlying their beneficial effects appear complex and are not fully understood. This review aims to provide an update on the nutrigenomic effects of different groups of polyphenols from fruits and especially focuses on their cardiovascular protective effects in cell and animal studie...|$|R

30|$|FFQs are {{designed}} to measure dietary intake {{over an extended period}} of time, and is a commonly accepted tool to assess habitual <b>dietary</b> intake in <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> of diet and chronic diseases (Willett et al. 1988). In comparison to other dietary intake assessment methods, FFQs are relatively inexpensive, easy and quick to administer (Cade et al. 2002). In the US, a FFQ has been used to examine the relationship between fruit and vegetable intake and cardiovascular disease risk (Bazzano et al. 2002). Similarly, validated FFQs have been used for the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Study in several countries (Kroke et al. 1999), and to obtain dietary data from a large adult sample in the Australian National Nutrition Survey (Mishra et al. 2002). FFQ is a valid tool for the assessment of dietary habits of South Indians (Dwarkanath et al. 2012).|$|R

DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study carried out in six Brazilian state capitals. METHODS: Multiple linear regression was used to reduce the original food and drink list of the FFQ, which had contained 114 food items. The frequency of consumption and nutritional composition of the foods were also taken into consideration. To assess the validity of the shortened FFQ, the energy and nutrients values of the 24 -hour dietary recalls were deattenuated and log-transformed. RESULTS: The list of the FFQ of ELSA-Brasil was reduced to 76 food items. The intraclass correlation coefficients in the validation study ranged from 0. 17 (selenium) to 0. 66 (calcium).

40|$|Background: The {{rise in the}} {{prevalence}} of asthma in western societies {{may be related to}} changed <b>dietary</b> habits. <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> in children have shown inverse associations of asthma related outcomes with intake of fruits, vegetables, dairy and whole grain products, and fish. In contrast to most previous studies, we used both questionnaire and clinical data to define asthma. Methods: Intake of the abovementioned foods was studied in relation to asthma in 598 Dutch children aged 8 - 13 years. Dietary intake was estimated using a parent completed semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Current wheeze and current asthma were defined based on questionnaire data. More complex end points were defined using information on bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and atopic sensitisation as well. Linear associations were studied using logistic regression analysis and odds ratios presented for the highest versus the lowest tertile of intake. In the final models, adjustments were made for maternal educational level, foreign descent, and total energy intake. Results: The intake of whole grain products and of fish was inversely associated with asthma. Adjusted odds ratios for the independent associations with whole grains and fish were 0. 46 (95 % CI 0. 19 to 1. 10) and 0. 34 (95 % CI 0. 13 to 0. 85) for current asthma and 0. 28 (95 % CI 0. 08 to 0. 99) and 0. 12 (95 % CI 0. 02 to 0. 66) for atopic asthma with BHR. Similar results were observed for current wheeze and atopic wheeze with BHR. Intake of (citrus) fruits, vegetables, and dairy products showed no clear associations with asthma end points. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a high intake of whole grain products and fish may have a protective effect against asthma in children...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the relative validity and reproducibility of a quantitative food frequency questionnaire (QFFQ) for adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Methods: Validity was evaluated by comparing the data generated by QFFQs to those of 24 -hour recalls (24 [*]hrs). QFFQs were applied twice per patient to assess reproducibility. Statistical analysis included performing t-tests, obtaining Pearson correlation coefficients when necessary, correcting measurements for randomness by the weighted kappa method, calculating intraclass correlation coefficients, and generating Bland-Altman plots (P< 0, 05). Results. The total energy and nutrient intake as estimated by the QFFQs were significantly higher than those from 24 hrs. Pearson correlation coefficients for energy-adjusted, deattenuated data ranged from 0. 32 (protein) to 0. 75 (lipid, unsaturated fat and calcium). Weighted kappa values ranged from 0. 15 (vitamin C) to 0. 45 (calcium). Bland-Altman plots indicated acceptable validity. As for reproducibility, intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 24 (calcium) to 0. 65 (lipid), and the Bland-Altman plots showed good agreement between the two questionnaires. Conclusion: The QFFQ presented an acceptable ability to classify correctly and with good reproducibility, adolescents with type 1 diabetes according to their levels of dietary intake...|$|R

There is large interest to develop metabolomics-based methods for reflec-tion of <b>dietary</b> exposure in <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> and standardized intervention studies. The aim of this BSc- thesis {{was to investigate the}} possibilities if metabolomics analyses of urine and blood specimens could be used to reflect differences in subject characteristics, lifestyles, and dietary patterns in free-living humans. Empirical data were collected using database search for articles where dietary metabolomics experiment were conducted and reported in human subjects, along with reference search in the selected articles. Metabo-lites from food, endogenous response to exposure, and gut microbial activity were found responsible for metabolic signatures of dietary intake in both blood and urine specimens. Gender, age and diurnal variation were also found responsible for unique metabolic signa-tures, characterized to some extent by likely lifestyle factors such as diet. Subject characte-ristics, lifestyle, and time of sampling are suggested to play important roles when assessing a metabolic signature of dietary patterns. Other factors to consider is for how long the die-tary effect will last, usage of proper statistical analysis, and choice of analytical platform. To conclude, food seems to have a rather large influence on human urine and blood me-tabolic phenotype and identification of metabolic signatures of dietary patterns, using me-tabolomics, is likely to be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} whether higher intakes of unprocessed red meat, chicken and fish {{are associated with}} higher intakes of vegetables in middle-aged, non-vegetarian Australian women. Methods: Food intake data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 10 530 middle-aged Australian women (50 – 55 years) who completed the third survey of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. The validated <b>Dietary</b> Questionnaire for <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Studies</b> (Version 2) was used. Multivariate regression analyses {{were used to determine}} the association between vegetable intake and four variables: total meat, red meat, chicken and fish intake in grams per day. Results: Total meat (regression coefficient (RC) = 0. 32, 95 % CI: 0. 30 – 0. 34; P P P P < 0. 001) were significantly associated with higher vegetable intakes after adjusting for confounders. The adjusted R 2 values for each of the regression models were relatively small (0. 1590, 0. 1394, 0. 0932, 0. 0802), indicating that the included predictors did not account for much of the variation in vegetable intake. Conclusion: These results provide some evidence that higher intakes of unprocessed red meat, chicken and fish are associated with higher intakes of vegetables. This supports the notion that many Australians who are serving up unprocessed red meat, chicken or fish for their meals are also consuming a number of vegetable serves...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{exposures}} to essential and toxic elements may alter health trajectories, {{depending on the}} timing, intensity, and mixture of exposures. In epidemiologic studies, these factors are typically analyzed {{as a function of}} elemental concentrations in biological matrices measured at one or more points in time. Such an approach, however, fails to account for the temporal cyclicity in the metabolism of environmental chemicals, which if perturbed may lead to adverse health outcomes. Here, we conceptualize and apply a non-linear method-recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) -to quantify cyclical components of prenatal and early postnatal exposure profiles for elements essential to normal development, including Zn, Mn, Mg, and Ca, and elements associated with deleterious health effects or narrow tolerance ranges, including Pb, As, and Cr. We found robust evidence of cyclical patterns in the metabolic profiles of nutrient elements, which we validated against randomized twin-surrogate time-series, and further found that nutrient dynamical properties differ from those of Cr, As, and Pb. Furthermore, we extended this approach to provide a novel method of quantifying dynamic interactions between two environmental exposures. To achieve this, we used cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA), and found that elemental nutrient-nutrient interactions differed from those involving toxicants. These rhythmic regulatory interactions, which we characterize in two geographically distinct cohorts, have not previously been uncovered using traditional regression-based approaches, and may provide a critical unit of analysis for environmental and <b>dietary</b> exposures in <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Evidence {{supports}} strong {{associations between}} healthful eating patterns {{and maintaining a}} healthy weight with favourable health outcomes for breast cancer survivors (BCS). The present study aimed to evaluate the diet quality of Australian BCS and to determine whether diet quality differed between BCS and age-matched healthy controls (HC) or by geographical location. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 281 BCS and 4069 HC from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health mid-aged cohort completing Survey 3 in 2001. Data from the <b>Dietary</b> Questionnaire for <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Studies</b> food frequency questionnaire were {{used to calculate the}} Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS), a validated summary estimate of diet quality based on adherence to the Australian dietary guidelines. Results: The mean (SD) ARFS of the BCS group was 33. 2 (9. 4) out of a maximum of 74. Mean (SD) total ARFS and component scores of BCS did not differ from the HC group [32. 9 (8. 7) ] and no differences were found in ARFS between urban and rural BCS. Conclusions: This is the first study dedicated exclusively to describing the diet quality of Australian BCS. Although no difference was found when comparisons were made with a HC group, there is considerable room for improvement in the diet quality of Australian BCS. Given research suggesting higher risk of chronic conditions such as obesity amongst BCS, and the recognition of optimising diet quality as a key factor in health promotion for all population groups, data from the present study suggest the need for research targeting the feasibility and impact of improving diet quality of Australian BCS...|$|R

Setting: A population-based cohort participating in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH). Subjects: A national sample of Australian women, aged 20 - 25 and 31 - 36 years, who were classified as preconception or pregnant when completing Survey 3 or Survey 5 of the ALSWH, respectively. The 1907 women with biologically plausible energy intake estimates were included in regression analyses of associations between preconception and pregnancy ARFS and subsequent pregnancy outcomes. Results: Preconception and pregnancy groups were combined as no significant differences were detected for total and component ARFS. Women with gestational hypertension, compared with those without, had lower scores for total ARFS, vegetable, fruit, grain and nuts/bean/soya components.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{evidence for the}} role of nutrition in the prevention of depression. This study aims to describe changes in diet quality over 12 years among participants in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health in relation to changes in depressive symptoms. Women born between 1946 and 1951 were followed-up for 12 years (2001 - 2013). Dietary intake was assessed using the <b>Dietary</b> Questionnaire for <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Studies</b> (version 2) in 2001, 2007 and every 2 - 3 years after that until 2013. Diet quality was summarised using the Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS). Depressive symptoms were measured using the ten-item Centre for Epidemiologic Depression Scale at every 2 - 3 -year intervals during 2001 - 2013. Linear mixed models were used to examine trends in diet quality and its sub-components. The same model including time-varying covariates was used to examine associations between diet quality and depressive symptoms adjusting for confounders. Sensitivity analyses were carried out using the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) index to assess diet quality. Minimal changes in overall diet quality and its sub-components over 12 years were observed. There was a significant association between baseline diet quality and depression (β=- 0. 24, P= 0. 001), but this was lost when time-varying covariates were added (β=- 0. 04, P= 0. 10). Sensitivity analyses showed similar performance for both ARFS and MDP in predicting depressive symptoms. In conclusion, initial associations seen when using baseline measures of diet quality and depressive symptoms disappear when using methods that handle time-varying covariates, suggesting that previous studies indicating a relationship between diet and depression may have been affected by residual confounding...|$|R

Dietary intake was measured using the <b>Dietary</b> Questionnaire for <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Studies</b> Version 2 Food Frequency Questionnaire. Serum lipid species and carotenoids were measured, using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography, as biomarkers of dairy and vegetable intake, respectively. Associations were determined using linear regression adjusted for potential confounders. Results: PWV (n = 95) was inversely associated with reduced fat dairy intake (β = - 0. 01; 95 % CI- 0. 02,- 0. 01; p = 0 < 0. 05) in particular yoghurt consumption (β = - 0. 04; 95 % CI- 0. 09,- 0. 01; p = 0 < 0. 05) after multivariate adjustment. Total vegetable consumption was negatively associated with PWV in the whole cohort after full adjustment (β = - 0. 04; 95 % CI- 0. 07,- 0. 01; p < 0. 05). Individual lipid species, particularly those containing 14 : 0, 15 : 0, 16 : 0, 17 : 0 and 17 : 1 fatty acids, known to be of ruminant origin, in lysophosphatidylcholine, cholesterol ester, diacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and triacylglycerol classes were positively associated with intake of full fat dairy, after adjustment for multiple comparisons. However, there was no association between serum lipid species and PWV. There were no dietary predictors of central blood pressure or augmentation index after multivariate adjustment. Conclusion: In this cohort of subjects with diabetes reduced fat dairy intake and vegetable consumption were inversely associated with PWV. The lack of a relationship between serum lipid species and PWV suggests that the fatty acid composition of dairy may not explain the beneficial effect...|$|R
40|$|Demand {{for organic}} foods is {{partially}} driven by consumers' perceptions {{that they are}} more nutritious. However, scientific opinion is divided on whether there are significant nutritional differences between organic and non-organic foods, and two recent reviews have concluded that there are no differences. In the present study, we carried out meta-analyses based on 343 peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods. Most importantly, the concentrations of a range of antioxidants such as polyphenolics were found to be substantially higher in organic crops/crop-based foods, with those of phenolic acids, flavanones, stilbenes, flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins being an estimated 19 (95 % CI 5, 33) %, 69 (95 % CI 13, 125) %, 28 (95 % CI 12, 44) %, 26 (95 % CI 3, 48) %, 50 (95 % CI 28, 72) % and 51 (95 % CI 17, 86) % higher, respectively. Many of these compounds have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, in <b>dietary</b> intervention and <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies.</b> Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues was found to be four times higher in conventional crops, which also contained significantly higher concentrations of the toxic metal Cd. Significant differences were also detected for some other (e. g. minerals and vitamins) compounds. There is evidence that higher antioxidant concentrations and lower Cd concentrations are linked to specific agronomic practices (e. g. non-use of mineral N and P fertilisers, respectively) prescribed in organic farming systems. In conclusion, organic crops, on average, have higher concentrations of antioxidants, lower concentrations of Cd and a lower incidence of pesticide residues than the non-organic comparators across regions and production season...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{assessed the}} relative validity and reproducibility of the <b>Dietary</b> Questionnaire for <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Studies</b> (DQESV 2) over one month in young adults, {{given the lack}} of concise and convenient instruments for assessing recent dietary intake in this population. Participants were recruited from a large Australian university (N =  102; 35 % male; age 18 - 34 years; body mass index 16 - 37 kg/m(2)). Five one-day weighed food records (WFR) were administered over one month followed by the DQESV 2. Estimates for nutrients (energy, protein, total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, sugars, dietary fibre, and alcohol) and fruit and vegetable servings were compared between methods using correlation coefficients, 95 % limits of agreement, and quintile classifications. One week later, a second DQESV 2 was completed by n =  77 of the participants to assess reproducibility using intra-class correlations (ICC) and weighted kappa. Comparing methods, all nutrients and fruit and vegetable servings showed significant positive correlations (P< 0. 05) except protein intake in males; over 60 % of participants were within one quintile classification except total fat and dietary fibre intakes in males (55 % and 56 %, respectively); and differences in nutrient and food intakes between methods were all within +/- 20 % of the mean WFR values except alcohol intake in females. Between first and second administrations of the DQESV 2 all ICC coefficients were positive (P< 0. 01) and weighted kappa coefficients ranged from 0. 54 for fruit servings (including fruit juice) in males to 0. 91 for protein intake in females. Over a one month period, the DQESV 2 demonstrated good reproducibility for the studied nutrients and for fruit and vegetable servings and provided a valid measure of the studied nutrients, except alcohol in females, and of fruit servings (including fruit juice) in both genders, at the group level in this young adult population...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} and quantification {{of risk factors}} that are characterized by low exposure levels, moderately increased risks, and unspecific exposure-disease relations is a major challenge facing risk assessment today. Occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> {{can play a role}} in addressing this challenge. The main advantage of occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> over other potential sources of information for risk assessment (primarily animal bioassays) is that in these studies humans are being investigated, rendering the extrapolation of study results from animals to humans unnecessary. However this advantage is also a disadvantage because occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> are mostly observational by nature which makes them prone to bias. Although some limitations of the use of occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> in risk assessment are inherent to the discipline, improvements in the design, conduct and interpretation of studies will likely enhance their use in risk assessment. Furthermore, recent developments in the field of molecular biology and the related increase in the understanding of carcinogenesis and other adverse health effects have opened opportunities to further advance the contribution of occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> to risk assessment. This thesis consists of a set of approaches that {{can be used as a}} framework to advance the use of occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> in risk assessment. The approaches focus on the evaluation of the quality of occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> for risk assessment, the incorporation of differences in study quality in methods for evidence synthesis, and the incorporation of biomarkers in occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies.</b> Some of the approaches are ready to be applied in risk assessment. Other approaches need further development before their actual value for risk assessment can be assessed. Further progress in the use of occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> in risk assessment should come from tailoring study designs to the needs of risk assessment. A strong focus on high quality quantitative exposure assessment in the design of new occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> and transparency of the steps undertaken to develop quantitative exposure estimates would significantly contribute to an increased weight of evidence for risk assessment and would likely improve the overall quality of risk assessment for many exposures...|$|R
