500|$|Daniel Simpson Day – Landis {{remarks in}} a voiceover that D-Day {{has been the}} hardest to track down for the documentary, saying that rumors have flown around, with his {{whereabouts}} ranging from a Buddhist monastery in Nepal to the Yukon Territory.

[...] <b>He</b> <b>slams</b> the door in Landis' face and then bursts {{out of the garage}} in a car.

500|$|Karofsky is {{featured}} in the first eleven episodes of the second season continuing his bullying ways; in the sixth, [...] "Never Been Kissed", he especially targets Kurt, who is gay. After <b>he</b> <b>slams</b> Kurt into a locker, Kurt chases after and confronts him, and an increasingly agitated Karofsky abruptly grabs Kurt and kisses him. Before Karofsky can initiate a second kiss, a stunned Kurt shoves him away, and Karofsky leaves. Kurt and his new gay friend Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) later {{try to talk to}} him about being gay and closeted, but he denies that the kiss happened and soon resumes his bullying. He even threatens to kill Kurt if he tells anyone else about the kiss. Kurt's father Burt (Mike O'Malley) finds out about the threat, but not the kiss, and Karofsky is soon expelled, but is allowed to return by the school board because no physical violence to Kurt had been witnessed; Kurt transfers to Dalton Academy to get away from him.|$|E
