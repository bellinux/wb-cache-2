5|$|In 2008, the Nova Scotia Legislature {{declared}} the Sable Island Horse {{as one of}} the provincial symbols, making them the official horse of Nova Scotia. In 2011, the Canadian government created the Sable Island National Park Reserve, which allows further protection of the island and horses. Aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> Sable Island Horses live only at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park in Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia.

5|$|The {{explosive}} phreatomagmatic eruptions {{caused by}} the easy access of water to the erupting vents threw rocks up to a kilometre (0.6mi) away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> and sent ash clouds as high as 10km (6mi) up into the atmosphere. The loose pile of unconsolidated tephra would quickly have been washed away had the supply of fresh magma dwindled, and large clouds of dust were often seen blowing away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> during {{this stage of the}} eruption.|$|E

These animals feed in areas ranging from the coast of California to the Bering Sea. Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century and might have gained a dominance over North Pacific right whales, as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.|$|E

5|$|As Carol was {{threatening}} Bermuda, planes flew away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> and ships returned to harbor for safety. Although hurricane-force winds were initially predicted, Carol only brushed the island with high waves and gale force winds.

5|$|As {{the islands}} have no {{harbours}} or anchorages, the phosphate ships were loaded by securing to deep moorings and embarking their cargo via cantilever jetties. During south-westerly wind periods—which are common from November to March—the ships {{had to stop}} loading and sail away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> until conditions improved. It was common for these ships {{to be allowed to}} drift to save fuel, and there were often several vessels lying off Nauru.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> Bartlett and an Inuk {{companion}} set {{out across}} the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances.|$|E
