25|$|Other {{individuals}} {{have questioned the}} assumptions that link systems of organ gifting with the equitable distribution of human organs arguing that the voluntary and altruistic donation of organs does not necessarily imply the free transplantation of that organ. In other words, under current systems of healthcare in the U.S., not only are organ donations managed by private {{organizations such as the}} United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), but organ transplantation is provided only to those who can afford it and in rare cases to those who <b>desperately</b> <b>need</b> it.|$|E
25|$|Once the war began, the Confederacy pinned its {{hopes on}} {{military}} intervention by Great Britain and France. As for King Cotton, Confederate leaders were {{unaware that the}} British were not dependent on Southern cotton and that Great Britain had stocks on hand to last over a year, having developed alternative sources of cotton, most notably in India and Egypt. Great Britain was unwilling to risk war with the U.S. to acquire more cotton {{at the risk of}} losing the large quantities of food imported from the North. Meanwhile, the Confederate national government had lost control of its own foreign policy when cotton planters, factors, and financiers spontaneously decided to embargo shipments of cotton to Europe in early 1861. It was a hugely expensive mistake, depriving the Confederacy {{of millions of dollars in}} cash it would <b>desperately</b> <b>need.</b>|$|E
25|$|By September 2006, Luke {{is married}} to Edward's {{manipulative}} daughter Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot). However, Robert's daughter, Dr. Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough), announces a potential drug therapy that can help Laura recover. Despite knowing that {{it could lead to}} permanent catatonia, Luke decides {{to go ahead with the}} treatment as all of Laura's children <b>desperately</b> <b>need</b> her. Lucky (then-Greg Vaughan) is recovering from a drug addiction and had an affair with Felicia's daughter Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms), Lulu has recently had an abortion, and Nikolas is raising a young son on his own. On October 26, 2006, Laura awakens, and is surprised that so much time has passed.

Feeling stronger, Laura gets her children to start revealing their secrets so she can help them.|$|E

[...] He concluded that the [...] "reform's only significant employment impact was a reduction in the labor force, primarily because people holding onto jobs just to keep insurance could finally retire", because they have health insurance outside of their jobs.|$|E

500|$|Historians criticized Blassingame for {{dismissing the}} WPA slave {{interviews}} and relying solely on fugitive slave narratives. In the Journal of American History, Willie Lee Rose writes that Blassingame's {{use of the}} fugitive slave narratives is marred by his neglect of the WPA interviews. Kenneth Wiggins Porter regards Blassingame's dependence on printed sources as a [...] "major weakness" [...] and believes he does not use enough white sources like plantation records and travel narratives, particularly Frederick Law Olmsted's account {{of life in the}} antebellum South. According to George Rawick, [...] "We <b>desperately</b> <b>need</b> work that depicts and analyzes the lives of black women under slavery. We have had very largely a male-dominated literature about slavery." [...] He notes, [...] "Blassingame, unfortunately, does not help us at all in this task."

500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Venice, Frederick again caught cold; privately, Mackenzie was growing seriously concerned, having observed a continued tendency for Frederick's throat and larynx to swell. He forbade Frederick from speaking at any length, noting {{that if the}} Crown Prince insisted on speaking and contracted further colds, he could give him {{no more than three}} months to live. At the beginning of October, Victoria noted that [...] "Fritz's throat is giving no cause for fresh anxiety & he really does take a little more care and speaks a little less." [...] On 6 October, Frederick, his family and Mackenzie left for a villa at Baveno on the shore of Lake Maggiore, with Mackenzie leaving Baveno on 8 October, after predicting Frederick's recovery [...] "in 3 or 4 months," [...] wrote Victoria. Their elder son Wilhelm joined them at Baveno on 17 October for Frederick's 56th birthday the following day. At the end of October, Frederick's condition abruptly worsened, with Victoria writing to her mother on 2 November that Frederick's throat was again inflamed, but not due to any cold, and that he was [...] "very hoarse again" [...] and easily became depressed about his health. General Alfred von Waldersee observed that Frederick's health had grave implications, as if William died soon and his son succeeded, [...] "a new Kaiser who is not allowed to speak is a virtual impossibility, quite apart from the fact that we <b>desperately</b> <b>need</b> a highly energetic one." [...] His son Wilhelm reported to King Albert of Saxony that his father was frequently short-tempered and melancholic, though his voice appeared to have slightly improved, and that Frederick's throat was being treated by [...] "blowing in a powder twice a day to soothe the larynx." ...|$|E

[...] Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa made [...] "Operation Pothole" [...] one of his top priorities in 2008 and pledged to fill 1 million potholes. However, due to the city's poorly managed budget, the city's Bureau of Street Services has only a single dedicated pothole-repair truck to cover 275 miles of streets (meaning that the backlog is still bad and getting worse).

Your {{compassion}} has reached beyond our family, beyond our community, and is changing our world, and for this we sincerely thank you." [...] The Amish do not normally accept charity, but because of the extreme nature of the tragedy, donations were accepted. Richie Lauer, director of the Anabaptist Foundation, said the Amish community, whose religious beliefs prohibit them from having health insurance, will likely use the donations to help pay the medical costs of the hospitalized children.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews and ratings from mainstream critics, the album {{has received a}} metascore of 81, based on 44 reviews. Neil McCormick, writing in The Daily Telegraph, gave the album a five-star review, calling it a [...] "bold, beautiful and baffling electric bolt through its own mythos". Andy Gill, in another five-star review for The Independent, praised the album as [...] "the greatest comeback album in rock'n'roll history", adding that the work is [...] "as good as anything he's made". The Guardian awarded the album four stars, deeming it [...] "thought-provoking, strange and filled with great songs". Time Out London gave the album a positive notice, praising it as an [...] "intelligent, memorable and even a little provocative" [...] addition to Bowie's discography. In a review for BBC Music, Jude Clarke wrote that The Next Day [...] "is a triumphant, almost defiant, return. Innovative, dark, bold and creative, it's an album only David Bowie could make". In a review rated 8 out of 10, NME said that [...] "rather than reinventing Bowie, [...] absorbs his past and moves it on". The Quietus wrote a positive review and concluded: [...] "so {{more than half the}} album is fantastic, and the rest is very, very strong." [...] At Q, Andrew Harrison evoked that the release [...] "feels like a dam bursting", and this is because the album [...] "is a loud, thrilling, steamrollingly confident rock and roll album full of noise, energy, and words that [...] if as cryptic as ever they were [...] sound like they <b>desperately</b> <b>need</b> to be sung." [...] One of the few negative reviews to emerge from the United Kingdom was in The Wire. Mark Fisher called The Next Day an album of [...] "quotidian mediocrity", saying it was entirely undeserving of its wide acclaim and that the [...] "wave of hyperbole it generated point to a wider malaise in contemporary music" [...] because it proved that anything of low artistic merit could achieve success via [...] "artfully timed PR".|$|E
