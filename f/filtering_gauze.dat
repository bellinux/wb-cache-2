50|$|It is not {{necessary}} to use filter in an air mover in a relatively clean environment. Generally, a <b>gauze</b> <b>filter</b> is attached to the inlet to collect larger particles. However, filters are always a beneficial precaution.In environments with high ambient dust levels, it is beneficial to utilize a filter system that has double filtration. First, air passes through a pre-filter that collects larger dust particles. Second, the air travels through a screen filter where smaller particles are captured.|$|R

Compared with the intermediately aggressive D 07038 strain obtained from the Cotton Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, V 991 is highly toxic, defoliant and more virulent. For conidial production, V 991 and D 07038 were subcultured from potato dextrose agar plates onto Czapek’s medium and incubated at 26 °C for 7  days. Fungal cultures were <b>filtered</b> through sterile <b>gauze</b> to removal the mycelium. The concentrations of the conidial suspensions were counted under a microscope using a hemocytometer and adjusted to 1.0 [*]×[*] 107 conidia/ml with sterile distilled water (Zhang et al. 2012 b).|$|R
40|$|The {{life history}} {{parameters}} of {{early stages of}} marine invertebrates, particularly field estimations,have received relatively little attention. The aim {{of this research was}} to estimate in situ abundance and growth of Mytilus galloprovincialis planktonic larvae. Plankton samples were <b>filtered</b> through <b>gauze</b> of 63 mm mesh and identified, counted and measured using an inverted microscope. Short-term fluctuations in Mytilus galloprovincialis larvae abundance and environmental parameters (water temperature, salinity, wind velocity direction, tidal amplitude and chlorophyll a) were monitored (two to three times a week). Larval cohorts were identified using size–frequency distributions and age estimates compared with larval shell growth lines. Data were fitted to the linear, exponential, von Bertalanffy and Laird–Gompertz growth models. Larval growth adjusted 21 2 better to the Laird–Gompertz model (0. 52560. 073 mm d; r 50. 768; P, 0. 05). Reduction of shell growth after 1 to 1. 5 months in the plankton suggests the occurrence, in this period, of a ‘delay of metamorphosis’ phase. The results of our study indicate that advection and availability of settlement substratum may be the key factors for the life history parameters of this species in a coastal system such as the Ria Formosa...|$|R
30|$|Aliquots of 50  ml of {{distilled}} water {{were added to}} each flask {{at the end of}} the incubation period and these flasks were agitated for 1  h at 30  °C and 200  rpm. The obtained suspension was <b>filtered</b> through <b>gauze</b> pieces, and the remaining liquid was manually squeezed out then added to the filtrate. The whole process was repeated twice (Camilios-Neto et al. 2011). The filtrates were then pooled and centrifuged for 10  min at 10, 000  rpm to collect the supernatant. In case of sunflower seed meal and mixtures containing this substrate, supernatant was found to contain residual oil. Therefore, these supernatants were vigorously shaken with n-hexane 1 : 1 (v/v) to remove residual oil and centrifuged (10, 000  rpm, 10  min) to separate the aqueous and n-hexane phases. This was done to avoid interference during orcinol assay (Kosaric and Vardar-Sukan 2014). The aqueous phase was then used for RL quantification. RL concentrations were expressed first as the product mass per kilogram of initial dry solids (g/kg IDS). In addition, to compare with results obtained in SLF, we expressed RL concentration as grams per liter of impregnating solution added to the solid substrate (g/l IS) (Camilios-Neto et al. 2011).|$|R

Bars of shadow across the characters and in the background variously imply imprisonment, the crucifix, the symbol of the Free French Forces and emotional turmoil. Dark film noir and expressionist lighting was used in several scenes, particularly {{towards the end of the}} picture. Rosenzweig argues these shadow and lighting effects are classic elements of the Curtiz style, along with the fluid camera work and the use of the environment as a framing device.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{investigators}} (1) {{have demonstrated}} the presence in normal human gastric juice of a protease which is active at neutral reaction. Cer-tain properties were exhibited which distinguished the enzyme from pepsin and trypsin. Subsequent studies (2 - 4) showed that the protease and the so-called intrinsic factor of Castle possessed cer-tain identical properties: both are removed by ad-sorption with Lloyd's reagent, both are unable to penetrate a semi-permeable membrane, they are not destroyed by Berkefeld filtration or exposure to alkali, but are destroyed by exposure to heat and are inhibited by an environment more acid than pH 3. 5. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} this protease activity was absent or greatly diminished in patients with Addisonian pernicious anemia, but was normal in patients with pernicious tapeworm anemia. The pathogenesis of the macrocytic anemia in sprue has aroused much speculation. Because it seemed important {{to determine whether or not}} the intrinsic factor was contained in the gastric juice of this disease, and because the gastric pro-tease which is active at neutral reaction may be identical with Castle's intrinsic factor, it was de-cided to measure gastric protease activity at neu-tral reaction in sprue. METHODS The method was similar to that previously described (1), except for modifications noted below. Gastric juice was collected free from bile after stimulation with hista-mine and promptly <b>filtered</b> through <b>gauze.</b> The juice was brought to pH 10 with sodium hydroxide and kept for 30 minutes at 400 C, after which it was brought t...|$|R
40|$|A {{sampling}} protocol {{was developed to}} examine particles released from granular activated carbon <b>filter</b> beds. A <b>gauze</b> filter/Swinnex procedure was used to collect carbon fines from 201 granular activated carbon-treated drinking water samples over 12 months. Application of a homogenization procedure (developed previously) indicated that 41. 4 % of the water samples had heterotrophic plate count bacteria attached to carbon particles. With the enumeration procedures described, heterotrophic plate count bacteria were recovered at an average rate of 8. 6 times higher than by conventional analyses. Over 17 % of the samples contained carbon particles colonized with coliform bacteria as enumerated with modified most-probable-number and membrane filter techniques. In some instances coliform recoveries were 122 to 1, 194 times higher than by standard procedures. Nearly 28 % of the coliforms attached to these particles in drinking water exhibited the fecal biotype. Scanning electron micrographs of carbon fines from treated drinking water showed microcolonies of bacteria on particle surfaces. These data indicate that bacteria attached to carbon fines {{may be an important}} mechanism by which microorganisms penetrate treatment barriers and enter potable water supplies...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{performed}} in order to investigate {{the relationships between the}} salt use, the mechanisms affecting the salt emission, dispersion and the salt exposure in a modeling approach. The salt was collected on <b>gauze</b> <b>filter</b> salt vanes at distances of 2. 5 m to 100 m from the road, allowing a time resolution of 30 minutes to 24 hour exposure time. The results will be implemented in a winter maintenance management model under development by the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI). The results showed that the roadside exposure to airborne salt is strongly related to the wind direction. The road conditions of packed snow and thin ice seemed to temporarily abate the roadside exposure by capturing the salt on the road surface. Even at a distance of 100 m from the road a positive relation of the wind sum and chloride deposition showed on days with strong winds. The modeling approach indicate the importance of residual salt, traffic, road surface characteristics, and wind for roadside exposure but also that there are several aspects of these variables that need further investigations...|$|R
40|$|The {{epidemiology}} of Campylobacter jejuni {{indicates that}} waterborne transmission is important; the organism has been isolated from seawater, fresh water, and estuarine sites. Membrane filtration, {{with and without}} use of an enrichment broth, {{has been the most}} common method for isolating C. jejuni from water. We evaluated two methods for isolating C. jejuni from water: membrane filtration and gauze filtration. The membrane filters evaluated included 0. 22 - and 0. 45 -micron-pore Millipore filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.), 0. 2 - and 0. 4 -micron-pore Nuclepore filters (Nucleopore Corp., Pleasanton, Calif.), and a 0. 45 -micron-pore Zetapor filters (AMF Cuno, Meridian, Conn.). The <b>gauze</b> <b>filters</b> included both Moore and Spira swabs. Of the membrane filters evaluated, the 0. 45 -micron-pore Millipore and Zetapor filters were the most sensitive for recovery of C. jejuni from seeded waters. The 0. 45 -micron-pore Millipore filter placed in Oosterom broth was better for recovery of C. jejuni from seeded stationary surface waters than either the Spira or Moore swab. However, the 0. 45 -micron-pore Millipore filter placed on a plate or in enrichment broth was equivalent to the Spira gauze swab when used to examine water from Atlanta area streams. C. jejuni organisms were isolated from 9 of 24 surface water samples representing 5 of 12 streams...|$|R
40|$|Aims Flooding {{disturbance}} {{can change}} the species composition of plant communities. Field investigation showed that annual herbs were {{an important part of}} the natural vegetation of the water-level-fluctuating zone (WLFZ) in the Three Gorges Reservoir, but there are few studies on the effects of flooding on annual plants. Annual, which reproduce from seeds, usually grow fast and can rapidly rehabilitate areas. Our objective is to determine the effects of water submergence on the germination of seeds of annuals, with regard to possible use of annual plants in vegetation restoration of WLFZ in the Three Gorges area. Methods Seeds of four annuals, Echinochloa crusgali, Setaria pumila, Digitaria sanguinalis and Arthraxon hispidus, were collected in autumn 2008 in Wushan County of Chongqing Municipality. Seeds for control (CK) were kept in envelopes; seeds for water submergence treatments were buried in soil in plastic containers and water was poured into the containers to maintain a water layer on the soil surface. We used six different durations of water submergence, 30, 75, 115, 155, 195 and 240 days, to match water level operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir. After treatments ended, seeds were separated from soil by water flushing and <b>filtering</b> with <b>gauze.</b> The treated seeds were incubated in pots filled with soil watered daily. Three replicates of 50 seeds per sample were used for each treatment. Germinated seeds were counted daily until the end of germination. Important findings Water submergence significantly affected seed germination rate and germination course of all four annuals. Germination rates first increased and then decreased with increased duration of submergence. Germination rates with short-time submergence treatments were significantly higher than CK. Submergence can break seed dormancy and increase the rate of seed germination. Submergence also accelerated the course of germination. Short-time submergence treatments increased germination indices significantly greater than in CK, and the germination periods were shorter, but long-time submergence had little effect on the course of seed germination. Overall, the germination rates of all treatments of all annuals were > 40 %. Therefore, these four annuals are useful in vegetation restoration of WLFZ in the Three Gorges Reservoir...|$|R

The produto was <b>filtered</b> using sterile <b>gauze</b> and package them for further evaluation. The concentrations of the treatments that worked were 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of the infectious agent, determining the degree of inhibition of the pathogen in Petri dishes. The best results were obtained with the application of eucalyptus leaves, since its effect was 100 % at all concentrations, without neglecting the fruits of the Neem and garlic with inhibition percentages of 75 and 60 % respectively, had a behavior directly proportional to the concentrations used, since the greater the amount of extract the inhibitory effect was better in this case 75 % and 100 %...|$|R

Nanotechnology overcomes the limitation of applying conventional methods to impart certain properties to textile materials. There is no doubt that {{in the next few years}} nanotechnology will penetrate into every area of the textile industry. Nanotextiles are nanoscale fibrous materials that can be fictionalized with a vast array of novel properties, including antibiotic activity, self-cleaning and the ability to increase reaction rates by providing large surface areas to potential reactants. These materials are used not only as cloth fabric, but as <b>filter</b> materials, wound-healing <b>gauzes</b> and antibacterial food packaging agents in food industry. World demand for nano-materials will rise more than two-and-a-half times to $ 5. 5 billion in 2016 driven by a combination of increased market penetration of existing materials, and ongoing development of new materials and applications. In recent years was demonstrated that nanotechnology can be used to enhance textile attributes, such as fabric softness, durability and breathability, water repellency, fire retardancy, antimicrobial properties in fibers, yarns and fabrics. The development of smart nanotextiles has the potential to revolutionize the production of fibers, fabrics or nonwovens and functionality of our clothing and all types of textile products and applications.
