40|$|In {{support of}} CH 2 M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. 's (CHG) {{closure of the}} Hanford Site Single-Shell Tank (SST) Waste Management Area (WMA) tank farms, {{numerical}} simulations of flow and solute transport were executed to investigate different potential contaminant source scenarios that may pose long-term risks to groundwater from {{the closure of the}} C Tank Farm. These simulations were based on the initial assessment effort (Zhang et al., 2003), but implemented a revised approach that examined a range of key parameters and multiple base cases. Four different potential source types were identified to represent the four base cases, and included past leaks, diffusion releases from residual wastes, leaks during retrieval, and ancillary equipment sources. Using a two-dimensional cross section through the C Tank Farm (Tanks C- 103 –C- 112) and a unit release from Tank C- 112, two solutes (uranium- 238 (U- 238) and technetium- 99 (Tc 99)) were transported through the problem domain. To evaluate the effect of sorption on contaminant transport, seven different sorption coefficients were simulated for U 238. Apart from differences in source releases, all four base cases utilized the same median parameter values to describe flow and contaminant transport at the WMA C. Forty-six additional cases were also run that examined individual transport responses to the upper and lower limits of the median parameter values implemented in the base case systems. For the conservative solute, Tc- 99, results amongst the base cases showed that the simulations investigating past leaks demonstrated the highest peak concentrations and the earliest arrival times (48 years) due to the proximity of the plume to the water table and the high recharge rate before surface barriers were installed. Simulations investigating leaks during retrieval predicted peak concentrations ~ 60 times smaller than the past leak cases, and corresponding arrival times that occurred ~ 70 years later. The diffusion release base case predicted the lowest peak concentrations and arrival times for all solutes. Even after 10, 000 years of simulation, only 11. 2 % of the Tc- 99 mass migrated past the fence line compliance point in the groundwater. Although ancillary equipment cases released the contaminant at a similar depth as the diffusion cases, nearly all of the Tc- 99 (99. 0 %) exited the groundwater domain {{by the end of the}} simulation due to differences in release rates. These differences were also reflected in the peak arrival times, which were ~ 8, 500 years for the <b>diffusion</b> <b>base</b> case, and ~ 3, 700 years for the base ancillary equipment release. In the diffusion cases, peak concentration predictions were sensitive to the rate of diffusion, but had no impact on the peak concentration arrival times. The average peak concentration was ~ 3. 2 times higher than the base case value for the upper estimate of diffusion, and 3. 2  10 - 3 lower for the lower bounding estimate. The past leak, ancillary equipment and retrieval leak cases were sensitive to the estimate of the pre-barrier installment recharge rate. For example, on average for the past leaks, relative concentrations increased by ~ 2. 2 times for the upper recharge estimate, and decreased by ~ 0. 14 times for the lower bound. Faster arrival times were associated with the upper recharge estimate, and slower arrival times with the lower estimate. Similar trends in both predicted peaks and arrival times occurred for the ancillary equipment and retrieval leaks scenarios that investigated the uncertainty in the pre-barrier installment recharge rate. Uncertainty in the plume depth also impacted predicted peak concentrations and arrival times for the past leak scenario. Trends similar to the pre-barrier installment recharge rate resulted, with higher concentrations and earlier breakthroughs associated with a lower plume depth, and lower concentrations and later breakthroughs with a higher plume depth...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{localization}} of nodes on {{a network}} is a challenging research topic. It arises {{in a variety of}} applica-tions such as communications and sensor network analysis.

40|$|In reverberant {{electromagnetic}} environments such as reverberation chambers, shielding enclosures, {{vehicles and}} buildings, the electromagnetic energy density is often {{assumed to be}} uniform and the direction of arrival of electromagnetic waves (Poynting vector) and their polarisation is assumed uniformly distributed. This {{is the basis of}} the power balance method for electromagnetic coupling analysis and much of the theory of reverberation chambers. However significant field inhomogeneity is often encountered in practice when significant losses are present. In this paper we show why this must be so when an energy flow exists from the source of energy to absorptive elements, and how the non-uniformity can be determined using a <b>diffusion</b> <b>based</b> solution. The <b>diffusion</b> <b>based</b> solution, though not as computationally efficient as the power balance method, is still much more efficient than a full-wave approach...|$|R

40|$|Very recently, Transformation based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) was pro-posed by Dutta and Bhattacharya (2014) as a much {{efficient}} {{alternative to}} the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, especially in high dimensions. The main advantage of this algorithm is that it simultaneously updates all components of a high dimensional parameter using ap-propriate “move types ” and considering appropriate deterministic transformation of a single random variable within the move type, thereby reducing time complexity and enhancing the acceptance rate. The optimal scaling of the additive TMCMC approach has already been studied for the Gaussian proposal density by Dey and Bhattacharya (2013 b). In this paper, we discuss diffusion-based optimal scaling behavior for non-Gaussian proposal densities-in particular, uniform, Student’s t and Cauchy proposals. We also consider <b>diffusion</b> <b>based</b> optimal scaling for non-Gaussian proposals when the target density is discontinuous. In {{the case of the}} Random Walk metropolis (RWM) algorithm these non-regular situations have been studied by Neal and Roberts (2011) in terms of expected squared jumping distance (ESJD), but the <b>diffusion</b> <b>based</b> approach has not been considered. Although we could not formally prove our diffusion result for the Cauchy proposal, simulation based results lead us to conjecture that at least the recipe for obtaining general optimal scaling and optimal acceptance rate holds for the Cauchy case as well. We compare our <b>diffusion</b> <b>based</b> TMCMC approach with that of ESJD based RWM approach for the challenging Cauchy proposal case, showing that additive TMCMC outperforms RWM with our conjectured optimal scale and acceptance rate...|$|R

40|$|Clock {{synchronization}} {{has paid}} a great magnitude {{of attention in}} the distributed systems. Sensor networks differ from traditional distributed system in many ways. One of the dramatic differences is the energy constraint in sensor network which is absent in traditional distributed systems.

Sensor networks make extensive use of time synchronized operations in many contexts (for example TDMA schedulers, synchronized sleep period, tracking and surveillance application).

40|$|Anisotropic {{diffusion}} {{is a key}} {{concept in}} digital image denoising and restoration. To improve the anisotropic <b>diffusion</b> <b>based</b> schemes and to avoid the well-known drawbacks such as edge blurring and ‘staircasing’ artifacts, in this paper, we consider a class of weighted anisotropic diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs). By considering an adaptive parameter within the usual divergence process, we retain the powerful denoising capability of anisotropic diffusion PDE without any oscillating artifacts. A well-balanced flow version of the proposed scheme is considered which adds an adaptive fidelity term to the usual diffusion term. The scheme is general, in the sense that, different diffusion coefficient functions can be utilized according to the need and imaging modality. To illustrate {{the advantage of the}} proposed methodology, we provide some examples, which are applied in restoring noisy synthetic and real digital images.
