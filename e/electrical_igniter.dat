50|$|One design uses a fuze strip (containing barium {{chromate}} and powdered zirconium metal in a ceramic paper) {{along the edge}} of the heat pellets to initiate burning. The fuze strip is typically fired by an <b>electrical</b> <b>igniter</b> or squib by application of electric current.|$|E
5000|$|The process starts by {{loading the}} {{workpiece}} into an explosion-proof chamber, {{which is then}} sealed and clamped with approximately [...] The chamber is then evacuated of air and filled with an oxygen and fuel mix; this mixture is pressurized to [...] An <b>electrical</b> <b>igniter</b> then ignites the mixture, which burns for approximately 20 milliseconds, causing all of the sharp corners and burrs to burn away. The peak temperature reaches 3000 C.|$|E
50|$|Pyrotechnic heat {{sources are}} often used for {{activation}} of thermal batteries, where they serve to melt the electrolyte. There are two main types of design. One uses a fuze strip (containing barium chromate and powdered zirconium metal in a ceramic paper) {{along the edge of}} the heat pellets to initiate burning. The fuze strip is typically fired by an <b>electrical</b> <b>igniter</b> or squib by application of electric current. The second design uses a center hole in the battery stack into which the high-energy <b>electrical</b> <b>igniter</b> fires a mixture of hot gases and incandescent particles. The center-hole design allows much faster activation times (tens of milliseconds) vs. hundreds of milliseconds for the edge-strip design. Battery activation can also be accomplished by a percussion primer, similar to a shotgun shell. It is desired that the pyrotechnic source be gasless. The standard heat source typically consist of mixtures of iron powder and potassium perchlorate in weight ratios of typically 88/12, 86/14, and 84/16. The higher the potassium perchorate level, the higher the heat output (nominally 200, 259, and 297 calories/gram, respectively). The size and thickness of the iron-perchlorate pellets has little influence on their burn rate, however the effect of density, composition, and particle size have significant effect on the burn rate and can be used for its adjusting for desired heat output profile. Another composition in use is zirconium with barium chromate. Another mixture is 46.67 wt.% of titanium, 23.33% of amorphous boron, and about 30% barium chromate. Yet another one is 45 wt.% tungsten, 40.5% barium chromate, 14.5% potassium perchlorate, and 1% vinyl alcohol acetate resin binder.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} and experimental effort was completed {{to evaluate a}} baffle type thermal conditioner for superheating O 2 and H 2 at supercritical pressures. The thermal conditioner consisted of a heat exchanger and an integral reactor (gas generator) operating on O 2 /H 2 propellants. Primary {{emphasis was placed on}} the hydrogen conditioner with some effort on the oxygen conditioner and a study completed of alternate concepts for use in conditioning oxygen. A hydrogen conditioner was hot fire tested under a range of conditions to establish ignition, heat exchange and response parameters. A parallel technology task was completed to further evaluate the integral reactor and heat exchanger with the side mounted <b>electrical</b> spark <b>igniter...</b>|$|R
25|$|Most {{igniters}} in {{gas turbine}} applications are <b>electrical</b> spark <b>igniters,</b> similar to automotive spark plugs. The igniter {{needs to be}} in the combustion zone where the fuel and air are already mixed, but it needs to be far enough upstream so that it is not damaged by the combustion itself. Once the combustion is initially started by the igniter, it is self-sustaining and the igniter is no longer used. In can-annular and annular combustors (see Types of combustors below), the flame can propagate from one combustion zone to another, so igniters are not needed at each one. In some systems ignition-assist techniques are used. One such method is oxygen injection, where oxygen is fed to the ignition area, helping the fuel easily combust. This is particularly useful in some aircraft applications where the engine may have to restart at high altitude.|$|R
50|$|Another design uses {{a central}} {{hole in the}} middle of the battery stack, into which the high-energy <b>electrical</b> <b>igniter</b> fires a mixture of hot gases and {{incandescent}} particles. This allows much faster activation times (tens of milliseconds) vs. hundreds of milliseconds for the edge-strip design. Battery activation can be accomplished by a percussion primer, similar to a shotgun shell. The heat source should be gasless. The standard heat source typically consist of mixtures of iron powder and potassium perchlorate in weight ratios of 88/12, 86/14, or 84/16. The higher the potassium perchlorate level, the higher the heat output (nominally 200, 259, and 297 cal/g respectively). This property of unactivated storage has the double benefit of avoiding deterioration of the active materials during storage and eliminating capacity loss due to self-discharge until the battery is activated.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn the past, wands with polder {{were used}} to {{fireworks}} ignition. But {{the proximity of the}} operator with the explosive tubes (or parts) was very dangerous and needed a new system more safety. Nowadays, ignition of each tube or explosive device is made from a firing case, located near the management place, using <b>electrical</b> <b>igniter</b> [1]. These igniters provide to convert electrical power in a flame which ignites mortar tube. Igniters are connected to the firing system by electrical wires called shooting wires. To provide easier network of shooting wires, which may be complex, it is possible to add electrical relays in this network {{to reduce the number of}} connexions rising management place. Then, the manager selects a wire and demands ignition of selected mortar tube. This kind of classical design needs a lot of time to installation and uninstallation (Image 1). More difficulties can be added like: presence of water, high installationâ€¦ This kind of solution is also expensive with shooting wires (copper electrical wires) ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{tests of}} a prototype {{fire suppression system}} installed in the engine compartment of a test vehicle. The prototype fire suppression systeni consisted of 2 Solid Propellant Gas Generators (SPGG) and two optical detectors. These components was installed {{on the hood of}} the test vehicle and powered from the battery in the test vehicle. The test vehicle was subjected to a crash test in which power steering fluid expelled onto the exhaust manifold autoignited. In this test, the prototype fire suppression system failed to extinguish this fire. A series of four static fire tests were conducted using the crash tested vehicle. For these static fire tests, the vehicle was stationary. Two fully charged SPGG units were installed in the test vehicle before each test. The first static fire test involved manual activation of the SPGG unite without a fire underhood. This was done to evaluate the effect of the SPGG discharge on underhood components. In the subsequent three static fire tests, fires were ignited in the engine compartment using an <b>electrical</b> <b>igniter</b> or by spraying power steering fluid onto a metal block heated by electrical heaters. In these static fire tests, the prototype fire suppression system failed to extinguish the test fire in two tests and extinguished the test fire in one,test...|$|E
