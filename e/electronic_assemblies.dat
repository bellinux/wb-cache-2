25|$|One of {{the major}} uses of this method is {{soldering}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>assemblies.</b> There are two main types of profiles used today: The Ramp-Soak-Spike (RSS) and the Ramp to Spike (RTS). In modern systems, quality management practices in manufacturing industries have produced automatic process algorithms such as PWI, where soldering ovens come preloaded with extensive electronics and programmable inputs to define and refine process specifications. By using algorithms such as PWI, engineers can calibrate and customize parameters to achieve minimum process variance and a near zero defect rate.|$|E

Soldered joint have influence on total quality of <b>electronic</b> <b>assembly</b> equipment (<b>electronic</b> <b>assembly</b> equipment on PCB – print circuit board). Mechanical tests are mainly used for resistance evaluation of components, parts and whole products against mechanical stress, which is applied on objects during function, transport and storage. Mechanical stress also changes electrical properties of the soldered joints, such as electrical resistance. Mechanical stress could cause the occurrence of cracks {{on the surface of}} the soldered joints. Proportions and frequency of cracks is possible evaluation by the image analysis. 1...|$|R
