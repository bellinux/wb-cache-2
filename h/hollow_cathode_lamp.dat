50|$|Gas flow {{sputtering}} {{makes use}} of the <b>hollow</b> <b>cathode</b> effect, the same effect by which <b>hollow</b> <b>cathode</b> <b>lamps</b> operate. In gas flow sputtering a working gas like argon is led through an opening in a metal subjected to a negative electrical potential. Enhanced plasma densities occur in the <b>hollow</b> <b>cathode,</b> if the pressure in the chamber p and a characteristic dimension L of the <b>hollow</b> <b>cathode</b> obey the Paschen's law 0.5 Pa·m < p·L < 5 Pa·m. This causes a high flux of ions on the surrounding surfaces and a large sputter effect.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} development of spectroscopic techniques which benefit {{from the use of}} charge-transfer devices. Both charge-coupled devices (CCD's) and charge-injection devices (CID's) are used in the techniques presented here such as atomic emission spectroscopy and latent fingerprint imaging. The use of a CID echelle system for axial viewing of the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) demonstrates the enhancement in sensitivity that can be obtained over tangential viewing. More importantly though, are the advantages afforded by simultaneous multi-element detection. Axial viewing of the ICP has shown to not only improve upon the detection limits of several metals by, in some cases, a half order of magnitude, but also {{to increase the amount of}} light collected and thus reduce the time of analysis. Along with this, the effect of interferences upon the detection of various metals is, at worst, equivalent to that of an ICP with tangential viewing. Further enhancement of sensitivity in atomic analysis can be achieved by atomic fluorescence with an ICP. Although in the past, <b>hollow</b> <b>cathode</b> <b>lamps</b> have proven to be insufficient, advanced designs of <b>hollow</b> <b>cathode</b> <b>lamps</b> presented here have demonstrated an increase in the intensity of lines of copper best suited for use in ICP atomic fluorescence. Lastly, a latent fingerprint has been imaged with the use of a scientific CCD and a flashlight where in the past such a technique was accomplished with high power lasers. By using a CCD, the immediate digitization of information combined with the sensitivity and image processing capabilities offer a portable means by which to image latent fingerprints on poor surfaces...|$|R
50|$|<b>Hollow</b> <b>cathode</b> <b>lamps</b> (HCL) are {{the most}} common {{radiation}} source in LS AAS. Inside the sealed lamp, filled with argon or neon gas at low pressure, is a cylindrical metal cathode containing the element of interest and an anode. A high voltage is applied across the anode and cathode, resulting in an ionization of the fill gas. The gas ions are accelerated towards the cathode and, upon impact on the cathode, sputter cathode material that is excited in the glow discharge to emit the radiation of the sputtered material, i.e., the element of interest. Most lamps will handle a handful of elements, i.e. 5-8. A typical machine will have two lamps, one will take care of five elements and the other will handle four elements for a total of nine elements analyzed.|$|R

No evidence was found for a difference in radiances between the two sources when the lamp was overrun.
