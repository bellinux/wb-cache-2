5|$|After {{the release}} {{and success of}} Fritz the Cat, several {{animated}} films meant for adults rather than children enjoyed success. Fritz, a film based on a character created by artist and illustrator Robert Crumb, was the first animated movie to receive an X rating in the United States. Charles Swenson developed <b>Down</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dirty</b> Duck as a project for former The Mothers of Invention band members Kaylan and Volman under the title Cheap! Had the film been released under this title, as director Mick Garris notes, the title would have been Roger Corman's Cheap! However, Roger Corman observed the title as a shot at his production techniques, and asked that the title be changed. The film's production budget was $110,000. According to Swenson, he created {{almost all of the}} animation himself, although publicity attributed the animation work to the Murakami-Wolf Production Company, with Academy Award Winning animator Fred Wolf, credited as his son's name, Bill Wolf, helped animate parts of the film personally. Although the film was promoted as an X-rated animated film, New World Pictures had not actually submitted it to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The film was also promoted as Dirty Duck, although the title on the film itself reads <b>Down</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dirty</b> Duck.|$|E

The plot consists of a series of often abstract sequences, including plot material created by stars Kaylan, Volman, Robert Ridgely, and, according to the film's ending credits, various people Swenson encountered during the making of the film.|$|E

500|$|His {{hallmark}} was his raw {{voice and}} ability to convey strong emotion. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic noted his [...] "hoarse, gritty vocals, brassy arrangements, an emotional way with both party tunes and aching ballads." [...] In the book Rock and Roll: An Introduction, authors Michael Campbell and James Brody suggested that [...] "Redding's singing calls to mind a fervent black preacher. Especially in up-tempo numbers, his singing is more than impassioned speech but less than singing with precise pitch." [...] According to the book, [...] "Redding finds a rough midpoint between impassioned oratory and conventional singing. His delivery overflows with emotion" [...] in his song [...] "I Can't Turn You Loose". Booker T. Jones described Redding's singing as energetic and emotional, but said that his vocal range was limited, reaching neither low nor high notes. Peter Buckley, in The Rough Guide to Rock, describes his [...] "gruff voice, which combined Sam Cooke's phrasing with a brawnier delivery" [...] and later suggested he [...] "could testify like a hell-bent preacher, croon like a tender lover or get <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>dirty</b> with a bluesy yawp".|$|E

Corey Moss of MTV News felt that their performance {{was one of the}} more memorable of the night. Emily Tan from the website Idolator noted that the performance was one of the band's best further writing, [...] "No one expected the girls to get as <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>dirty</b> as they did...

In 1972 he got a major television success playing Geppetto in the Luigi Comencini's adaptation The Adventures of Pinocchio. In the 1970s and early 1980s he continued alternating high-profile works and less ambitious comedies; among the most successful performances of the time, the emarginated immigrant of Bread and Chocolate (1973), the idealist worker of We All Loved Each Other So Much (1974), the old [...] shanty town patriarch of <b>Down</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dirty</b> (1976), the Vatican's magistrate of In the Name of the Pope King (1977), the abusive coffee-seller in Café Express (1980).|$|E
