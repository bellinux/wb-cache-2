50|$|Following World War II, plastic {{manufacture}} {{was seen}} as an industry with growth potential with many old and new companies making plastic figures that were widely available in the United States. Army men following the war were sold unpainted, usually in a green colour corresponding to United States Army uniforms in World War II. Plastic figures were sold en masse in clear plastic bags with an illustrated <b>header</b> <b>card</b> in different sizes and prices since the early 1950s.|$|E
50|$|MPS is column-oriented (as {{opposed to}} {{entering}} the model as equations), and all model components (variables, rows, etc.) receive names. MPS {{is an old}} format, so it is set up for punch cards: Fields start in column 2, 5, 15, 25, 40 and 50. Sections of an MPS file are marked by so-called <b>header</b> <b>cards,</b> which are distinguished by their starting in column 1. Although it is typical to use upper-case throughout the file for historical reasons, many MPS-readers will accept mixed-case for anything except the <b>header</b> <b>cards,</b> and some allow mixed-case anywhere. The names that you choose for the individual entities (constraints or variables) are not important to the solver; one should pick meaningful names, or easy names for a post-processing code to read.|$|R
50|$|USTC {{personnel}} removed Conwood racks from {{retail stores}} without the retailers' permission. There was testimony that Conwood {{had to spend}} $100,000 a month on replacement racks. USTC also removed Conwood products and destroyed Conwood racks and <b>header</b> <b>cards.</b> It was asserted {{that in some cases}} the compensation or bonuses of USTC sales representatives depended on their destroying Conwood racks. In addition to imposing replacement costs on Conwood, USTC's tactics decreased Conwood's sales volume substantially.|$|R

40|$|Suplemento de Investigación Pesquera. [...] 12 páginas, 3 cuadrosDuring {{the cruise}} Atlor V (Apri-May 1975, {{in the west}} coast of Spanish Sahara) 21 fishing hauls were carried out. Ninenteen of them were bottom trawls (using two {{commercial}} standard nets, with 40 and 48 mm size at code-end, mesured by ICNAF method, added with a cover of 10 mm mesh size), and two were IKMT sets. In the present report the methodology employed is described. Catches were subsampled under prestabilished conditions: a) species composition (number, weigts and relatives abundances for all species); b) length frecuencies distribution; and c) biological data from selected species (length, weight, sex maturity, age, stomachal contents, etc). Data from c) is not reported by the moment. Special deck annotaton sheets were used when picking up data. These sheets-at {{the end of the study}} of each haul-were directly punched in cards and entered to the DBP system. <b>Header</b> <b>cards</b> of DBP system included non biological data, as data, timing, situation, depth, weather, etc. A general table of species presences for the bottom trwals is reported. A total of 159 different species were identified. Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|However, a few {{models of}} xD card readers {{based on the}} Alauda chip do allow direct access (bypassing the above mechanisms) to an xD card's flash memory. These readers have been reverse-engineered and Linux drivers have been {{produced}} by the Alauda Project, which has documented the on-chip data structures of the xD card. According to this information, xD <b>card</b> <b>headers</b> {{are similar to those}} used by SmartMedia, and include chip manufacturer information.|$|R
50|$|A {{major feature}} of the FITS format is that image {{metadata}} is stored in a human-readable ASCII header, so that an interested user can examine the headers to investigate a file of unknown provenance. The information in the header is designed to calculate the byte offset of some information in the subsequent data unit to support {{direct access to the}} data cells. Each FITS file consists of one or more <b>headers</b> containing ASCII <b>card</b> images (80 character fixed-length strings) that carry keyword/value pairs, interleaved between data blocks. The keyword/value pairs provide information such as size, origin, coordinates, binary data format, free-form comments, history of the data, and anything else the creator desires: while many keywords are reserved for FITS use, the standard allows arbitrary use {{of the rest of the}} name-space.|$|R
5000|$|The card's front {{features}} the national flag as guilloché art and Juan Pablo Duarte's face as microprint reading [...] "República Dominicana." [...] The <b>card's</b> <b>header</b> {{is made up}} of alternating rows of [...] "RÉPUBLICA DOMINICANA" [...] and the card's type (either [...] "CÉDULA DE IDENTIDAD Y ELECTORAL" [...] or [...] "CÉDULA DE IDENTIDAD") printed in microtext. The bottom right corner features an image of the island in optically variable color-changing inks and a semi-transparent version of the cardholder's photo. The card's centre {{features the}} Dominican Republic's emblem inside a gulloché printed with invisible ink. The card's top right corner features a hologram of the JCE logo and the Santiago Monumento a los Héroes de la Restauración. Finally, microtext of the cardholder's name is printed under the cardholder's signature.|$|R
