5000|$|The Airports Authority of India will {{construct}} a passenger terminal at the civil enclave at Ahmednagar village at Pilibhit bypass. The district administration of Bareilly has received Rs. 11 crore {{from the government}} for the Civil <b>Enclave</b> <b>project.</b> 10 Hectares of Land has been acquired for this purpose from farmers at a cost of 25.69 Crores. The construction work has already begun and soon will be open for the public.|$|E
40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of including positive social actions in <b>enclave</b> <b>projects</b> after appropriate mitigation and compensation policies are in place, and addresses both the question of the mandatory or optional nature of these actions and the question of the responsible executing and financing agent or agents. The report defines <b>enclave</b> <b>projects,</b> reviews the experience of international financial institutions, the privatesector and the IDB with including positive social programs in enclave operations, and presents review findings and conclusions.

50|$|From the {{intersection}} with Webb Avenue, Laurel Canyon Boulevard heads due south, cutting through North Hollywood, closely following the Hollywood Freeway (SR 170). Laurel Canyon Boulevard {{passes through the}} Valley Village neighborhood, one mile (1.6 km) west of the Hollywood Split ({{the intersection}} of the Hollywood (U.S. 101/SR 170) and Ventura (U.S. 101/SR 134) freeways. This {{would have been the}} start of the proposed Laurel Canyon Freeway, which would have provided a direct freeway connection from the southeastern San Fernando Valley to the Los Angeles International Airport. The proposed route was along the current routing of Laurel Canyon Blvd, but the emergence of the Laurel Canyon neighborhood as a movie star <b>enclave</b> doomed the <b>project,</b> as did local opposition.|$|R
40|$|Cities in Turkey, {{following}} the neoliberal {{restructuring of the}} country, have undergone a process of transformation {{in the last decade}} at a greater pace than experienced in previous periods. Through these processes, while new territories have been constructed, previous formations have been dismantled. While some of these constructed territories are abstract (e. g. Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics [NUTS] regions), some are tangible and physically defined such as branded housing <b>enclaves.</b> Branded housing <b>projects</b> produce territories in the form of housing enclaves, which provide key services and facilities within their confines exclusively for project residents. By 2013, the number of branded housing projects located in Istanbul alone numbered 852 with the number of units provided by these projects amounting to 7. 7...|$|R
40|$|Enforcing {{integrity}} and confidentiality of users' application code and data is a challenging mission that any software developer {{working on an}} online production grade service is facing. Since cryptology is not a widely understood subject, people {{on the cutting edge}} of research and industry are always seeking for new technologies to naturally expand the security of their programs and systems. Intel Software Guard Extension (Intel SGX) is an Intel technology for developers who are looking to protect their software binaries from plausible attacks using hardware instructions. The Intel SGX puts sensitive code and data into CPU-hardened protected regions called <b>enclaves.</b> In this <b>project</b> we leverage the Intel SGX to produce a secure cryptographic library which keeps the generated keys inside an enclave restricting use and dissemination of confidential cryptographic keys. Using enclaves to store the keys we maintain a small Trusted Computing Base (TCB) where we also perform computation on temporary buffers to and from untrusted application code. As a proof of concept, we implemented hashes and symmetric encryption algorithms inside the enclave where we stored hashes, Initialization Vectors (IVs) and random keys and open sourced the code ([URL]...|$|R
