The dihydrodiols formed from benzo[a]pyrene 7, 8 - and 9, 10 -oxide by rat liver microsomal preparations were identical in their chromatographic and spectrographic properties with dihydrodiols formed when benzo[a]pyrene was metabolized by rat liver homogenates. 9, 10 -Dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene 7, 8 -oxide and 7, 8 -dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene 9, 10 -oxide were also synthesized.

40|$|Of 36 pure isomers (chlorine numbers 1 to 5) of {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} examined, 23 {{compounds}} were metabolized by Alcaligenes sp. strain Y 42, and 33 compounds were metabolized by Acinetobacter sp. strain P 6. The major pathway of many polychlorinated biphenyl isomers examined {{was considered to}} proceed through 2 ', 3 '-dihydro- 2 ', 3 '-diol compounds, concomitant dehydrogenated 2 ', 3 '-dihydroxy compounds, subsequently the 1 ', 2 '-meta-cleavage compounds (chlorinated derivatives of 2 -hydroxy- 6 -oxo- 6 -phenylhexa- 2, 4 -dienoic acids), and then chlorobenzoic acids. The meta-cleavage products were usually converted to chlorobenzoic acids upon further incubation in many polychlorinated biphenyls, but they accumulated specifically in the metabolism of 2, 4 '-, 2, 4, 4 '-, and 2, 5, 4 '-chlorobiphenyls, which are all chlorinated at the 2, 4 '-position in the molecules in common. Dihydroxy compounds accumulated mainly in the metabolism of 2, 6 -, 2, 3, 6 -, 2, 4, 2 ', 5 '-, 2, 5, 2 ', 5 '-, and 2, 4, 5, 2 ', 5 '-chlorobiphenyls by Acinetobacter sp. P 6.

Product study of the reaction of isoprene with O_ 3 3. Kinetic study of the reactions of isoprene primary oxidation products with OH radicals and O_ 3 (1.) 2 - and 3 -methyl- 3 -butene- 1, 2 -diol have been identified as products of the OH-initiated oxidation of isoprene in the absence of NO_x. From the yields of these <b>dihydroxy</b> <b>compounds</b> the branching ratio k_ 2 _a/k_ 2 =#alpha#= 0. 7 #+-# 0. 1 was obtained. In the presence of NO_x, a total yield of 11 % of organic nitrates was measured. The intermediate formation of peroxy nitrates was observed. The thermal lifetime at 298 K (1 atm) of these compounds was #propor to# 1 s. (2.) The formation yields of products from the ozonolysis of isoprene have been determined under different experimental conditions. The yields of the main products, methacrolein, methyl vinyl ketone, and formaldehyde, were found to increase upon addition of cyclohexane (#propor to# 400 ppm) as well as of water vapour (1 - 10 mbar). This can be explained by scavenging of OH-radicals and of Criegee-intermediates by cyclohexane and H_ 2 O, respectively. A number of products could be identified, which are thought to be formed by the decomposition of Criegee-intermediates: CO, CO_ 2, H_ 2, methanol, methyl hydroperoxide, propene, acetone, ketene, parts of the formaldehyde and eventually methylglyoxal. Some of these products are not formed directly, but via further reactions of the initially built alkyl or alkoxy radicals. (3.)

The diphenyl dicarbonates were prepared from phenyl chloroformate {{and the corresponding}} <b>dihydroxy</b> <b>compounds.</b> The process involved a precondensation step under a slow stream of dry argon with the elimination of phenyl acetate, followed by melt polycondensation at high temperature and under vacuum. The potential of this reaction is demonstrated by the successful synthesis {{of a series of}} aromatic-aromatic and aromatic-aliphatic polycarbonates having inherent viscosities from 0. 19 to 0. 43 dL/g. Thus low to intermediate molecular mass polymers were obtained. The 13 C-NMR spectra of the carbon of the carbonate group showed that the formed polycarbonates contain partial random sequence distribution of monomer residues in their chains.

A number of other aromatic compounds such as phenol, 2 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, 1, 3 -dihydroxybenzene, and 1, 2 -phenylethanediol were not glycosylated by GTF-D. Consequently GTF-D aromatic acceptors appear to require two adjacent aromatic hydroxyl groups.

Examples are poly(aliphatic disulfide) s, poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS), poly(sulfone), and polybenzothiazole. Several new polymerization reactions have been described in this thesis for the preparation of sulfur containing materials. The synthesis {{of a series of}} cyclic(arylene disulfide) oligomers was accomplished by catalytic oxidation of arylenedithiols with oxygen {{in the presence of a}} copper-amine catalyst. The cyclic(arylene disulfide) oligomers underwent a novel free radical ring-opening polymerization at elevated temperatures in the melt to form high molecular weight poly(arylene disulfide) s. Cyclic(arylene disulfide) oligomers were copolymerized with elemental sulfur at 250 °C to form stable poly(arylene sulfane) s containing 3 [...] 7 sulfur linkages. They also copolymerized with diiodoaromatic compounds, or dibromoaromatic compounds, in the presence of potassium iodide at 270 °C to give poly(thioaryiene) s with the formation of iodine as the coproduct in both cases. The novel self-polymerization of 4 -bromobenzenethiol was realized at 270 °C in m-terphenyl solution in the presence of a catalytic amount of free radical initiator. Hydrogen bromide is the sole side product. This novel reaction has also been extended to the synthesis of poly(thioarylene) s from arylenedithiols and dibromoaromatic compounds.

2500|$|Today, {{hydrogen}} peroxide is manufactured almost exclusively by the anthraquinone process, which was formalized in 1936 and patented in 1939.

Most commercial processes achieve oxidation by bubbling compressed air through a solution of the derivatized anthracene, whereby the oxygen present in the air reacts with the labile hydrogen atoms (of the hydroxy groups), giving hydrogen peroxide and regenerating the anthraquinone.

The diiron complexes themselves could also undergo SNAr reactions, provided that the complexed arenes contained a chlorine substituent. This allowed for the functionalization of the complexes with species that could not be introduced directly in their syntheses. The carbon nucleophiles generated from ethyl cyanoacetate or (phenylsulfony 1) acetonitrile could be attached to the complexed ethers in this manner. The FeCp+ moieties were removed easily by photolytic demetalation which allowed for the recovery of a wide range of functionalized diphenoxybenzenes.
