5|$|Several {{political}} changes preceded {{the passage of}} the settlement act. First, Senator Edmund Muskie (D-ME)who previously seemed supportive of a settlement, but was gaining national prominence on the issue of fiscal responsibility prior to the 1980 Democratic primarygave up his seat as Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to accept President Carter's nomination for Secretary of State. Second, Governor Brennan's choice to replace Muskie (and thus inherit his predecessor's committee assignments) was George Mitchell (D-ME)who had supported the land claim as U.S. Attorney and possessed legal gravitas due to his tenure as a District Judge. Another factor affecting the final push for the settlement was the <b>fear</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election, he would veto any settlement favorable toward the tribes.|$|E
25|$|Though this broadside-attack tactic was effective, it {{came too}} late {{to have a real}} effect on the war, and only small numbers of Me 262s were {{equipped}} with the rocket packs. Most of those so equipped were Me 262A-1as, members of Jagdgeschwader 7. This method of attacking bombers became the standard, and mass deployment of Ruhrstahl X-4 guided missiles was cancelled. Some nicknamed this tactic the Luftwaffe's Wolf Pack, as the fighters often made runs in groups of two or three, fired their rockets, then returned to base. On 1 September 1944, USAAF General Carl Spaatz expressed the <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> greater numbers of German jets appeared, they could inflict losses heavy enough to force cancellation of the Allied bombing offensive by daylight.|$|E
25|$|In late November 1191 the Crusader army {{advanced}} inland towards Jerusalem. In early December Saladin {{was under}} pressure from his emirs to disband {{the greater part of}} his army, which he reluctantly did on the twelfth of that month. Learning this, Richard pushed his army forward, spending Christmas at Latrun. The army then marched to Beit Nuba, only 12 miles from Jerusalem. Muslim morale in Jerusalem was so low that the arrival of the Crusaders would probably have caused the city to fall quickly. However, the weather was appallingly bad, cold with heavy rain and hailstorms. The poor weather, combined with the <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it besieged Jerusalem the Crusader army might be trapped by a relieving force, caused the decision to retreat back to the coast to be made.|$|E
25|$|However, James had {{a dilemma}} {{stemming}} from mutual distrust {{between himself and}} parliament. He <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he went to war, parliament would find an excuse to avoid providing the finance to support it. Parliament, on the other hand, <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they voted the finances, the king would find an excuse {{not to go to}} war. James died shortly afterwards, leaving foreign policy in the hands of Charles, who rather naively assumed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he followed the policy parliament had advocated, it would provide the funds for it.|$|R

25|$|As {{flying over}} Europe was {{forbidden}} {{to those who}} had used a Resistance escape route for <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> captured they would divulge the information, he was posted to an air defence squadron in Scotland. On 6 April 1942, he formed No. 165 Squadron RAF and served as its officer commanding until August. He was promoted to war substantive flight lieutenant on 14 July 1942. He was then appointed officer commanding No. 222 Squadron RAF, and in November 1942, he was appointed officer commanding No. 232 Squadron RAF. The squadron was posted to North Africa in December 1942. There, they provided close air support for the First Army in Algeria and Tunisia as part of the Desert Air Force. On 18 January 1943, he was shot down off the Tunisian coast and bale out into the sea. He was rescued by Arabs and taken to the shore. From there, he made his way back to his squadron through German controlled positions. This {{made him one of the}} very few men who had evaded capture twice during World War II. In April 1943, he shot down a Junkers Ju 87 and shared in the destruction of a second one. He also destroyed two aircraft on the La Sebala Airfield.|$|E

500|$|While the Sejm {{comprised}} representatives only of {{the nobility}} and clergy, the reformers were supported by the burghers (townspeople), who {{in the fall of}} 1789 organized a Black Procession, demonstrating their desire {{to be part of the}} political process. Taking a cue from similar events in France, and with the <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> burghers' demands were not met, their peaceful protests could turn violent, the Sejm on April 18, 1791 adopted a law addressing the status of the cities and the rights of the burghers (the Free Royal Cities Act). Together with the legislation on the voting rights (the Act on Sejmiks of [...] March 24, 1791), it became incorporated into the final constitution.|$|E

Prince Paul, {{in the middle of}} a cabinet crisis, offered a nonaggression pact and a declaration of friendship, but Hitler insisted on his proposals. Prince Paul warned that [...] "I <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I follow your advice and sign the Tripartite Pact I shall no longer be here in six months."

500|$|In Jackson's {{adaptation}} of the prequel, , Lee reprises his role as Saruman the White, even though Saruman {{does not appear in}} the novel. Saruman, Gandalf, Galadriel, and Elrond appear {{at a meeting of the}} White Council in Rivendell (loosely based on material from the Appendices), which discusses the mysterious Necromancer encountered by Radagast the Brown. Gandalf believes (correctly) that the Necromancer is Sauron resurgent, but Saruman dismisses this idea. Saruman also disapproves of the quest to reclaim the Dwarf kingdom of Erebor because it will wake the sleeping dragon Smaug, though Gandalf and Galadriel <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Sauron reappears, Smaug will join his forces eventually. [...] Gandalf presumed that Saruman would disapprove, so he had Thorin Oakenshield and company leave Rivendell before the council began. [...] In the final film of the trilogy, , Saruman and Elrond accompany Galadriel to Dol Guldur where they engage the resurrected Nazgûl in battle. After dispatching the Ringwraiths, Saruman and Elrond assist as Galadriel uses the power of her Ring to fight Sauron and banishes him from the fortress back to Mordor. Although Elrond insists that they need to hunt down Sauron, Saruman tells him to remain with Galadriel, who is severely weakened after the battle with Sauron, while he takes care of the Dark Lord.|$|E
500|$|Athletic {{authorities}} {{argued that}} Ward should not play {{because it would}} be discourteous to Georgia Tech, and he might be injured. [...] There was <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Ward played, he would be injured by malicious blows after the play had ended. [...] Playwright Arthur Miller, then a writer for Michigan’s student newspaper, learned first-hand about the strong resistance among the Georgia Tech team to playing on the same field with an African-American athlete. In his biography of Miller, Enoch Brater noted that Miller had friends from Arkansas who knew one of the Georgia Tech players. Brater described Miller’s involvement this way: “Remmel [...] took Miller with them to meet with members of the team, to protest but also to appeal to the athletes' sense of fair play. ‘Miller was {{right in the middle of}} this’, Remmel recalls. Not only did the visiting team rebuff ‘the Yankee’ Miller ‘in salty language’, but they told him they would actually kill Ward if he set one foot on the Michigan gridiron. [...] ‘The Georgia Tech team was wild.’ [...] Miller was furious. He ‘went immediately to the office of the Michigan Daily and wrote an article about it, but it was not published.’ [...] [...] [...] Remmel said that Miller ‘could not believe that the Georgia Tech team would have tried to destroy Willis Ward—but, I am sure they would have.’” ...|$|E

He knew that if the others overthrew Khanh his fate would be worse than Khanh's." [...] During this time, Thảo kept in touch with elements of the CIA in an attempt to get American backing. Meanwhile, Khiêm had been putting pressure on Khánh for over two months by charging him and the Buddhists of seeking a [...] "neutralist solution" [...] and [...] "negotiating with the communists". At the same time, Khánh's relationship with the Americans—particularly Ambassador and retired General Maxwell Taylor—had broken down over a series of policy disputes and personal arguments, and the Americans were trying to encourage Khánh's colleagues to overthrow him so that more hawkish policies could be enacted. The other generals wanted to overthrow Khánh and were aware that Thảo—who was widely distrusted—was planning to make a move. They anticipated trouble in trying to keep their subordinates, who were becoming impatient with Khánh's ongoing tenure, from joining Thảo. Between January and February, Thảo continued to finalize the details of his own counter-coup, using the contacts he had cultivated over the past decades.|$|E
500|$|In late December 1964, Thảo {{was summoned}} back to Saigon by Khánh, who {{correctly}} suspected him and Khiêm of plotting together in Washington. Thảo believed Khánh {{was attempting to}} have him killed, so he went underground upon returning to Saigon, and began plotting in earnest, unfazed {{by the prospect of}} being charged for desertion. The ruling junta appealed to Thảo in newspaper advertisements and broadcasts to follow orders to report, but he ignored them. Due to his Catholicism, Thảo was able to recruit Diệm loyalists such as Phát. In mid-January 1965, the regime called for him to report to his superiors in the ARVN, warning that he would be [...] "considered guilty of abandoning his post with all the consequences of such a situation" [...] if he failed to do so. At this time, it was still not known that Thảo was a communist agent who was deliberately trying to cause infighting within South Vietnam at every opportunity. With Khánh's hold on power shaky, an anonymous source said Thảo was worried about how he would be treated if someone else took over: [...] "Thảo acted first, out of <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he did not, the other generals would overthrow Khánh and get rid of him as well.

500|$|Giving {{evidence}} [...] to the tribunal, S. O. Davies said he {{had long}} suspected that the Aberfan tips were unstable, but had kept quiet for <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> tipping was stopped on the mountainside the Coal Board would close the colliery. Davies added: [...] "But if I {{had been asked to}} do so, I would have done it". His testimony was strongly challenged by the NUM, whose counsel Brian Gibbens QC said that [...] "f Mr Davies is to be accepted as truthful and accurate in his recollection... then he bears what must be one of the largest personal burdens of responsibility for the disaster". However, Gibbens found it incredible that a man in Davies's unique local position of authority and influence would not have mentioned his fears to any of the formal bodies—borough council, Coal Board, union or local Labour Party: [...] "If anyone could have exercised influence to overcome an obdurate or ignorant monolith like the Coal Board, [...] was well placed to do so." [...] Gibbens submitted that Davies's testimony should be rejected, on the grounds that he [...] "never appreciated what in fact was the import of his words". The tribunal concurred, accepting that Davies had not fully understood the gravity of his admission, and adding that had they been convinced otherwise, he could not have escaped censure. The tribunal's findings, published in July 1967, placed responsibility for the disaster firmly on the National Coal Board, specifically on the absence of any tipping policy.|$|E

She went on to state that it [...] "make it hard to tell whether the California party girl can actually sing". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy met the song with a mixed review. He commented on the choice of the single, noting [...] "the glimpses of emotion shown on her last offering, 'Your Love Is My Drug', are as long gone as her sobriety." [...] Although he was not completely convinced he wrote, [...] " [...] the vocals are more processed than a cheese string [...] the combination of a playful nursery rhyme hook and Dr Luke's bubblegummy electro production make this a pretty irresistible little dancefloor ditty." [...] He went on to give the single three out of five stars. Fraser McAlpine of BBC met the song with a mixed review giving the song three out of five stars. Fraser criticized the choice of the song commenting, [...] "there's a <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Kesha reveals that she's a sensitive young flower after all, with real feelings and a good, pure heart, her appeal with disappear like a soap bubble on a cactus, can it?". Nate Adams of No Ripcord was negative in his review of the song, calling it [...] "outright stupid" [...] and noted it would be something commonly heard on a playground. Adams wrote that the song touched on opposite-sex objectification, but wrote that the theme became wearisome on the album, using the song as one of the examples where the theme was overused.|$|E
