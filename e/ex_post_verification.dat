We examine two forms of costly verification, ex post inspection and ex ante certification. In equilibrium, <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>verification</b> is used to verify buyers' reports of low quality, while ex ante certification is used to verify sellers' shipments of high quality. Ex post inspection allows buyers to earn rents; in some circumstances, ex ante certification allows sellers to earn rents.

40|$|The most {{fundamental}} analytical errors {{that lead to}} overstated projected regional economic impacts (ex ante) are demand based: (1) failure to subtract local sources of spending and nonlocal uses of spending from the budgets of subject organizations or events; (2) erroneous attribution of all ancillary spending as causally related {{to the existence of}} the subject organization or event; and (3) failure to adapt multipliers to specific regions, including the failure to recognize the relationship between the likely size of the initial net spending injections and the speed with which those injections "leak" from the target region.

Since ISO NE’s real-time ancillary service market co-optimizes both energy and reserve products, <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> pricing is needed for both energy and reserve. A co-optimization approach for <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> pricing requires defining com-plex pricing rules and implementing heuristics to ensure consistent binding constraints with the ex ante dispatch. In order to avoid com-plexity and uncertainty of required heuristics, a new <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> pricing schema is proposed to calculate the <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> energy and reserve prices in a decoupled way while recognizing the coupling effect of energy and reserve.

We examine whether contemporaneous information in management earnings forecasts serves as a timely alternative to <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>verification.</b> We document that ex post verifiable quantitative news in unbundled forecasts, and characteristics of the linguistic tone itself, affect investors’ pricing of tone. Consistent with higher quality signals enhancing the credibility of contemporaneous lower quality signals, we find that quantitative news verifies the associated linguistic tone; when the two signals have the same sign, the price effect of tone is stronger. Furthermore, the pricing attenuation of tone is increasing in the imprecision of the quantitative forecast, suggesting that lower forecast quality compromises the quantitative signal’s credibility enhancement. Managerial incentives to inflate tone lead to the verification effect being greater for optimistic language, while management’s use of hyperbole results in attenuation of the tone’s pricing...|$|E
