40|$|<b>Interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> between nonwetting-wetting (NW-W) liquids {{in natural}} porous media were {{measured}} using {{a modified version}} of the interfacial partitioning tracer test (IPTT) method that employed simultaneous two-phase flow conditions, which allowed measurement at NW saturations higher than trapped residual saturation. Measurements were conducted over a range of saturations for a well-sorted quartz sand under three wetting scenarios of primary drainage (PD), secondary imbibition (SI), and secondary drainage (SD). Limited sets of experiments were also conducted for a model glass-bead medium and for a soil. The measured <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> were compared to <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> measured using the standard IPTT method for liquid-liquid systems, which employs residual NW saturations. In addition, the theoretical maximum <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> estimated from the measured data are compared to specific solid surface areas measured with the N- 2 /BET method and estimated based on geometrical calculations for smooth spheres. <b>Interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> increase linearly with decreasing W-phase (water) saturation over the range of saturations employed. The maximum <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> determined for the glass beads, which have no surface roughness, are 32 +/- 4 and 36 +/- 5 cm(- 1) for PD and SI cycles, respectively. The values are similar to the geometric specific solid surface area (31 +/- 2 cm(- 1)) and the N- 2 /BET solid surface area (28 +/- 2 cm(- 1)). The maximum <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> are 274 +/- 38, 235 +/- 27, and 581 +/- 160 cm(- 1) for the sand for PD, SI, and SD cycles, respectively, and similar to 7625 cm(- 1) for the soil for PD and SI. The maximum <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> for the sand and soil are significantly larger than the estimated smooth-sphere specific solid surface areas (107 +/- 8 cm(- 1) and 152 +/- 8 cm(- 1), respectively), but much smaller than the N- 2 /BET solid surface area (1387 +/- 92 cm(- 1) and 55224 cm(- 1), respectively). The NW-W <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> measured with the two-phase flow method compare well to values measured using the standard IPTT method...|$|R

The influence of the gas velocity and particle diameter on the <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas,</b> pressure drops and liquid holdups has been investigated. For both packings the limiting values of the gas velocities have been determined above which the <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> and liquid holdups stabilize.

40|$|<b>Interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> and gas hold-ups {{have been}} {{determined}} at pressures up to 1. 85 MPa {{in a bubble}} column with a diameter of 85. 5 mm and for superficial gas velocities between 1 and 10 cm s− 1. In some experiments the bubble column was packed with glass cylinders of length 5. 0 mm and diameter 4. 0 mm. The <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> were determined by the chemical method using the model reaction between CO 2 and aqueous diethanolamine (DEA) and hold-ups by observation of height differences. The <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> in the packed bubble column are unaffected by pressure. The gas hold-ups {{as well as the}} <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> in the bubble column increase with increasing operating pressure. The magnitude of the pressure influence depends on the superficial gas velocity. The positive influence of pressure on the gas hold-ups and the interfacial in the bubble column originates from the formation of smaller bubbles at the gas distributor...|$|R
50|$|The second {{method is}} often {{referred}} to as the add/remove volume method. When the maximum liquid volume is removed from the drop without the <b>interfacial</b> <b>area</b> decreasing the receding contact angle is thus measured. When volume is added to the maximum before the <b>interfacial</b> <b>area</b> increases, this is the advancing contact angle. As with the tilt method, the difference between the advancing and receding contact angles is the contact angle hysteresis. Most researchers prefer the tilt method; the add/remove method requires that a tip or needle stay embedded in the drop which can affect the accuracy of the values, especially the receding contact angle.|$|E

40|$|<b>Interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> and gas hold-ups {{have been}} {{determined}} at pressures up to 8. 0 MPa in a mechanically agitated gas—liquid reactor and a bubble column with {{a diameter of}} 81 mm for superficial gas velocites between 1 and 5 and 1 and 10 cm/s, respectively. The <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> have been determined by the chemical method using the model reaction between CO 2 and aqueous diethanolamine (DEA). Contrary to earlier reported results on <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> in a mechanically agitated reactor at pressures up to 1. 7 MPa, a positive influence {{of pressure on the}} <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> has been observed for higher pressures and higher superficial gas velocities. The product of the gas density G and the superficial gas velocity at the orifice υG, or was found to be an important parameter for the manifestation of the pressure effect. For values of GυG, or larger than 200 kg/m 2 s the <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> increase with increasing reactor pressure. Below this value of 200 kg/m 2 s no influence of pressure could be observed. The gas hold-ups in the bubble column in water as well as in an aqueous solution of DEA with antifoam increase with increasing pressure. This pressure effect on the gas hold-up in bubble columns originates from the formation of smaller bubbles at the gas distributor. The relative increase in the gas hold-ups is smaller in water and also if a porous plate instead of a perforated plate is used as gas distributor. The differences in the magnitude of the pressure effect are caused by differences in the coalescence behaviour of the gas bubbles in both liquids and by differences in the bubble formation process at the two types of gas distributors, respectively. The <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> in the bubble column also increase with increasing pressure. The relative increase in the <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> aP/aatm with increasing pressure may be as large as 200 % for a pressure increase from P = 0. 15 to 8. 0 MPa, {{depending on the type of}} gas distribution and the superficial gas velocity used...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on transparent two-dimensional microfluidic porous systems to investigate the relationships among capillary pressure and the <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> per volume between two fluid phases and one solid phase. Capillary pressures were calculated from the observed interfacial curvature of the wetting-nonwetting interface, and these correlated closely to externally measured values of applied pressure. For each applied pressure, the system established mechanical equilibrium characterized by stationary interfaces, uniform curvatures across the model, and random surface normals. To study the relationships among capillary pressure and the <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas,</b> we compare the curvature-based capillary pressure with the differential change in <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> per volume {{as a function of}} wetting-phase saturation. The differential pressure contributions calculated from the experimental measurements are found to be nearly independent of the measured capillary pressure.

40|$|With the re-evaluation and {{revision}} {{of a number}} of design floods, several embankment overtopping protection systems have been developed and a common technique is the construction of a stepped spillway on the downstream slope. For such moderate slope stepped channels, detailed air–water flowmeasurements were performed in a large facility with a focus on the rate of energy dissipation, flow resistance, air–water <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> and re-aeration rates. Past and present experimental results showed a significant aeration of the flow. The median dimensionless residual head was about 3 ×dc for the 21. 8 ◦ sloping chute and smaller than that for flatter slopes (θ = 3. 4 and 15. 9 degrees). The flow resistance results yielded an equivalent Darcy friction factor of about 0. 25 implying a larger flow resistance for the 21. 8 degree slope angle than for smaller slope angles. The re-aeration rate was deduced from the integration of the mass transfer equation using measured air–water <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> and air–water flow velocities. The results suggested an increasing re-aeration rate with increasing rate of energy dissipation. The stepped invert contributed to intense turbulence production, free-surface aeration and large <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas.</b> The experimental data showed however some distinctive seesaw pattern in the longitudinal distribution of air–water flow properties with a wave length of about two step cavities. While these may be caused by the interactions between successive adjacent step cavities and their interference with the free-surface, the existence of such "instabilities" implies that the traditional concept of normal flow might not exist in skimming flows above moderate-slope stepped spillways...|$|R
50|$|The other {{situation}} {{arises in}} detergency. One initially starts off with concentrations greater than CMC {{in water and}} on adding fabric with large <b>interfacial</b> <b>area</b> and waiting for equilibrium, the surfactant concentration goes below CMC and no micelles are left.

The difference between the advancing and receding angle is the contact angle hysteresis.|$|E

40|$|In {{hydraulic}} structures, free-surface aeration {{is commonly}} observed: i. e., the white waters. The air bubble entrainment may be localised (hydraulic jumps, plunging jets) or continuous along an interface (water jets, chutes). Despite recent advances, {{there are some}} basic concerns about the extrapolation of laboratory results to large size prototype structures. Herein the basic air bubble entrainment processes are reviewed and the relevant dynamic similarities are discussed. Traditionally, physical studies are conducted using a Froude similitude which implies drastically smaller laboratory Reynolds numbers than in the corresponding prototype flows. Basic dimensional analyses are developed for both singular and interfacial aeration processes. The results {{are discussed in the}} light of systematic investigations and they show that the notion of scale effects is closely linked with the selection of relevant characteristic air–water flow properties. Recent studies of local air–water flow properties highlight that turbulence levels, entrained bubble sizes and <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> are improperly scaled based upon a Froude similitude even in large-size models operating with the so defined Reynolds numbers up to 5 E+ 5.

The application of this reaction as a viscous gas—liquid system for the determination of <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> in gas—liquid contactors by the chemical method is discussed. The reaction kinetics have been determined by mass transfer experiments of CO 2 into solutions of DEA in aqueous ETG. To this end laboratory-scale stirred cell reactors with a flat surface have been used.

50|$|There are {{important}} situations where interfacial areas {{are large and}} the amount of surfactant at the interface cannot be neglected. For example, if we take a solution of a surfactant above CMC and start introducing air bubbles {{at the bottom of the}} solution, these bubbles, as they rise to the surface, pull out the surfactants from the bulk to the top of the solution creating a foam column thus bringing down the concentration in bulk to below CMC. This is one of the easiest methods to remove surfactants from effluents (foam flotation). Thus in foams with sufficient <b>interfacial</b> <b>area</b> there will not be any micelles. Similar reasoning holds for emulsions.|$|E
50|$|In the {{schematic}} to {{the right}} the contact angle between the droplet surface and the surface decreases {{from left to right}} (A to C), and we see that the surface area of the droplet decreases as the contact angle decreases.

Also, if instead of the surface being flat it curves towards fluid, then this also reduces the <b>interfacial</b> <b>area</b> and so the nucleation barrier. There are expressions for this reduction for simple surface geometries. In practice, this means we expect nucleation to be fastest on pits or cracks in surfaces made of material such that the nucleus forms a small contact angle on its surface.|$|E

Our approach combines new multi-phase flow theory, novel laboratory experiments, and non-traditional computational simulators to investigate practical approaches to include <b>interfacial</b> <b>areas</b> in descriptions of subsurface contaminant transport and remediation.
