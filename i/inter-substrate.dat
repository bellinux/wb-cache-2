40|$|We {{describe}} a multifunctional inositol polyphosphate kinase/phosphotransferase from Solanum tuberosum, StITPKa (GenBank accession number: EF 362784), hereafter called StITPK 1. StITPK 1 displays inositol 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrakisphosphate 1 -kinase activity: Km = 27 µM, and Vmax = 19 nmol min- 1 mg- 1. The enzyme displays inositol 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentakisphosphate 1 -phosphatase {{activity in the}} absence of a nucleotide acceptor and inositol 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentakisphosphate–ADP phosphotransferase activity in the presence of physiological concentrations of ADP. Additionally, StITPK 1 shows inositol phosphate-inositol phosphate phosphotransferase activity. Homology modelling provides a structural rationale of the catalytic abilities of StITPK 1. <b>Inter-substrate</b> transfer of phosphate groups between inositol phosphates is an evolutionarily conserved function of enzymes of this class...|$|E
40|$|The Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) {{equation}} {{provides a}} continuum description of electrostatic-driven diffusion {{and is used}} here to model the diffusion and reaction of acetylcholine (ACh) with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymes. This study focuses {{on the effects of}} ion and substrate concentrations on the reaction rate and rate coefficient. To this end, the PNP equations are numerically solved with a hybrid finite element and boundary element method at a wide range of ion and substrate concentrations, and the results are compared with the partially coupled Smoluchowski-Poisson-Boltzmann model. The reaction rate is found to depend strongly on the concentrations of both the substrate and ions; this is explained by the competition between the <b>inter-substrate</b> repulsion and the ionic screening effects. The reaction rate coefficient is independent of the substrate concentration only at very high ion concentrations, whereas a...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} the {{reaction}} medium to neutralize the separated research in peat milling workpiece in “Dokshitsyraygaz”. Peat is taken is characterized as a pine-sphag num (Sphagnum magellansky – 35 %, Sphagnum angustifolium – 25 %, Scots pine – 25 %, vaginal cotton grass – 15 %), the degree of decom-position – 18 %, ash content – 4. 7 %, pHKCl – 3. 2, 50 – 60 % relative humidity. To change {{the environment of the}} reaction as a calcareous material used dolomite flour and chalk. Doze of material is de-signed to skim 1 m 3 peat milling blank, which at a relative humidity of 50 – 60 % and the addition of a natural weight of about 250 kg. Studies have shown that the introduction of dolomite chalk and substrate in the reaction medium varies according to the dosage and duration of action of <b>inter-substrate</b> material with lime. The reaction medium in peat substrate is installed after 7 -day interaction with chalk and a 10 -day interaction with dolomite flour...|$|E
40|$|The physico-chemical {{properties}} of serpentine soils lead to strong selection of plant species. Whereas {{many studies have}} described the serpentine flora, little information {{is available on the}} fungal communities dwelling in these sites. Asbestos minerals, often associated with serpentine rocks, can be weathered by serpentine-isolated fungi, suggesting an adaptation to this substrate. In this study, we have investigated whether serpentine substrates characterized by the presence of rocks with distinct mineral composition could select for different fungal communities. Both fungal isolation and 454 pyrosequencing of amplicons obtained from serpentine samples following direct DNA extraction revealed some fungal taxa shared by the four ophiolitic substrates, but also highlighted several substrate-specific taxa. Bootstrap analysis of 454 OTU abundances indicated weak clustering of fungal assemblages from the different substrates, which did not match substrate classification based on exchangeable macronutrients and metals. Intra-substrate variability, as assessed by DGGE profiles, was similar across the four serpentine substrates, and comparable to <b>inter-substrate</b> variability. These findings indicate the absence of a correlation between the substrate (mineral composition and available cations) and the diversity of the fungal community. Comparison of culture-based and culture-independent methods supports the higher taxonomi...|$|E
40|$|Investigations of {{the elastic}} {{behavior}} of bulk elastomers have traditionally proceeded {{on the basis}} of classical rubber elasticity, which regards chains as thermally fluctuating but disregards the thermal fluctuations of the cross-links. Here, we consider an incompressible and flat elastomer film of an axisymmetric shape confined between two large hard co-planar substrates, with the axis of the film perpendicular to the substrates. We address the impact that thermal fluctuations of the cross-links have on the free energy of elastic deformation of the system, subject to the requirement that the fluctuating elastomer cannot detach from the substrates. We examine the behavior of the deformation free energy for one case where a rigid pinning boundary condition is applied to a class of elastic fluctuations at the confining surfaces, and another case where the same elastic fluctuations are subjected to soft "gluing" potentials. We find that there can be significant departures (both quantitative and qualitative) from the prediction of classical rubber elasticity theory when elastic fluctuations are included. Finally, we compare the character of the attractive part of the elastic fluctuation-induced, or pseudo-Casimir, stress with the standard thermal Casimir stress in confined but non-elastomeric systems, finding the same power law decay behavior when a rigid pinning boundary condition is applied, for the case of the gluing potential, we find that the leading order correction to the attractive part of the fluctuation stress decays inversely with the <b>inter-substrate</b> separation.
