5|$|In polling, Dodd <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> {{unable to}} break through to the top tier. In Nationwide polls he usually only polls at or around 1%. A November 7, 2007 Gallup poll placed him in last place, behind both Joe Biden and Dennis Kucinich at 1%. At the state level, Dodd has also not done so well. In a November 18, 2007 Iowa poll {{conducted}} by ABC news, he registered with 1% the same number from a similar poll done by ABC news on July 31, 2007. In New Hampshire, a poll conducted by CNN placed Dodd at 1% constant from a September poll but up from polls in June and July. However, on the straw poll level, Dodd was able to gain a victory during an event in South Carolina on March 5, 2007. He won the York County straw poll by receiving 28% of the 100 votes cast. Barack Obama came in second with 24%. Hillary Clinton got 18% and John Edwards received 11%. The victory came two days after Dodd visited the county which probably secured him the win.|$|E

25|$|Although the pallium is now reserved, by law and liturgical norms, to metropolitans, {{a single}} {{standing}} exception <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> to become customary: Pope John Paul II conferred a pallium on then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger when Ratzinger became Dean of the College of Cardinals and therefore also Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, a purely honorary title and one without an archbishopric or metropolitanate attached. When Ratzinger was elected Pope Benedict XVI, he continued that exception without comment by conferring the pallium on Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the new dean.|$|E

25|$|Rahane {{made his}} second ODI fifty in 2013-14 Asia Cup, {{only to be}} {{followed}} by another slump. In a short ODI career in the middle order, Rahane <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> unsure and struggled at times to find the balance between defence and attack. He showed signs of comfort {{at the top of the}} order with rapid centuries against England (September 2014) and Sri Lanka (November 2014), but Rohit Sharma's second ODI double-century followed by a big hundred against Australia at the MCG pushed Rahane back to the middle order. T20s In the ICC Cricket World Cup followed, Rahane only managed to score 208 runs from 8 matches, with an average of 34.66. He was dropped by Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the second ODI against Bangladesh but after the series, he was appointed as captain of India for its tour of Zimbabwe for ODIs and T20Is in 2015 when a second string squad was selected. India won that ODI series 3–0, although Rahane was not able to leave any big impacts with the bat, he made total of 112 in three matches with only one half-century in it.|$|E

500|$|Judaism {{focuses on}} the {{importance}} of valuing this life, and as such, suicide is tantamount to denying God's goodness in the world. Despite this, under extreme circumstances when there <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed individual suicide or mass suicide (see Masada, First French persecution of the Jews, and York Castle for examples) and as a grim reminder there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for [...] "when the knife is at the throat", for those dying [...] "to sanctify God's Name" [...] (see Martyrdom). These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities, regarded by some as examples of heroic martyrdom, while others state that it was wrong for them to take their own lives in anticipation of martyrdom.|$|E

500|$|Composer David Nichtern, {{who created}} Todd's theme music, said {{he loved the}} {{character}} and enjoyed implementing the {{different versions of the}} Todd theme. While describing the music that marked Todd's prominent 1996 [...] "return from the dead" [...] storyline (which documented his return to town after being presumed dead), Nichtern addressed the broader aspect of his composition for the character: [...] "All of Todd's music has had a certain 'vibe' to it, especially since the character is so well-drawn," [...] he stated. [...] "It also <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> particularly well-suited to my guitar style, so I've enjoyed 'becoming' Todd musically. The key is always to represent his dark side, but with the possibility of redemption and power behind the whole thing." [...] Nichtern added, [...] "That's what makes him such an interesting character. Todd's cues are always custom-made so to speak, so there is energy and attention going toward getting the exact flavor of what the current story-line is saying about his journey." ...|$|E
500|$|George Bernard Shaw {{believed}} that Fielding was [...] "the greatest practising dramatist, {{with the single}} exception of Shakespeare, produced in England between the Middle Ages and the nineteenth century." [...] However, modern critics rarely agree with Shaw, as Robert Hume points out, [...] "Few scholars have been much interested in Fielding's highly successful career as a dramatist. To most it <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> a false start. Readers tend to find the conventional plays derivative and sentimental, the topical ones scrappy and superficial." [...] In particular, only one book until 1988 was published on the topic, which was Ducrocq's Le theatre de Fielding, 1728–1737, et ses prolongements dans l'oeuvre romanesque. This critical approach {{is not limited to}} just Fielding, but to the whole field; the reputation of Colley Cibber was ruined by Pope's characterising him as the Arch Dunce and [...] "Since the plays of Cibber's only serious rival, Henry Fielding, are hardly even read these days, let alone performed, the earlier eighteenth-century theater tends to be passed over with (at best) a polite cough." ...|$|E
500|$|Chambers {{was named}} in the British squad for the 2012 London Olympics after the {{selectors}} took into account his trials win and his times from the previous year. Given the abrupt turnaround in his fortunes, he said: [...] "For me representing my country in an Olympics is a privilege that should never be taken for granted. To {{be given the opportunity}} to do so in my home town has been a dream that at times <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> very distant and is now a reality." [...] He returned to the British relay team at the 2012 European Athletics Championships after a six-year absence but a botched baton change saw the team disqualified. At the Olympics he won his 100 metres heat in a season's best of 10.02seconds, with a legal 2.0m/s following wind, in his first Olympic race in twelve years. He was drawn in the same semi-final as Usain Bolt but Chambers' run of 10.05 seconds for fourth meant he did not make the final. His Olympics came to an end in the 4×100 metres relay heats as the British team made an illegal baton exchange.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of Followings success, Nolan was afforded the {{opportunity}} to make his breakthrough hit Memento (2000). During a road trip from Chicago to Los Angeles, his brother Jonathan pitched the idea for [...] "Memento Mori", about a man with anterograde amnesia who uses notes and tattoos to hunt for his wife's murderer. Nolan developed a screenplay that told the story in reverse; Aaron Ryder, an executive for Newmarket Films, said it was [...] "perhaps the most innovative script I had ever seen". The film was optioned and given a budget of $4.5 million. Memento, starring Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss, premiered in September 2000 at the Venice International Film Festival to critical acclaim. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote in his review, [...] "I can't remember when a movie <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> so clever, strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time." [...] Basil Smith, in the book The Philosophy of Neo-Noir, draws a comparison with John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding which argues that conscious memories constitute our identities, a theme which Nolan explores in the film. The film was a box-office success and received a number of accolades, including Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for its screenplay, Independent Spirit Awards for Best Director and Best Screenplay, and a Directors Guild of America (DGA) Award nomination. Memento was considered by numerous critics {{to be one of the}} best films of the 2000s.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{wrote the}} lyric of the 1988 song [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] as a {{meditation}} {{on the idea of}} commitment. He later said, [...] "'s clearly about a younger version of myself and my relationship with Ali," [...] and added that by nature he was a wanderer, not a family man, and that [...] "The only reason I'm here is because I met someone so extraordinary that I just couldn't let that go." [...] U2 lyrics usually have several possible levels of interpretation, and it is not always possible to definitively ascribe Hewson's influence upon them, but music writer Niall Stokes believes that inspiration from Hewson is pronounced throughout the group's 1997 album Pop, particularly on [...] "Staring at the Sun", which he believes reflects her Chernobyl Children's Project involvement and the feelings of both danger and hopefulness that it triggered in Bono. Stokes also believes that the 2000 song [...] "When I Look at the World" [...] is an explicit acknowledgement of Hewson's strength and commitment as exemplified by that Chernobyl work, while others think it is about Jesus or God. Bono <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> to deflect those interpretations, saying that song is in part a hard-edged look at himself from the eyes of one losing faith. In any case, Bono has said that he does not feel constrained in his writing or interviews by what Hewson might think, as [...] " [...] doesn't read newspapers. Or listen to the radio. There's a mysterious distance between us." [...] Not known for being musical herself, Hewson did perform Lady Gaga's [...] "Telephone", as a duet with her husband, to serenade their daughter Eve at her 21st birthday celebration at a club in Las Vegas in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Æthelwulf's {{reputation}} among historians {{was poor}} in the twentieth century. In 1935 the historian R. H. Hodgkin attributed his pilgrimage to Rome to [...] "the unpractical piety which had led him to desert his kingdom {{at a time of}} great danger", and described his marriage to Judith as [...] "the folly of a man senile before his time". To Stenton in the 1960s he was [...] "a religious and unambitious man, for whom engagement in war and politics was an unwelcome consequence of rank". One dissenter was [...] Finberg, who in 1964 described him as [...] "a king whose valour in war and princely munificence recalled the figures of the heroic age", but in 1979 Enright said: [...] "More than anything else he appears to have been an impractical religious enthusiast." [...] Early medieval writers, especially Asser, emphasise his religiosity and his preference for consensus, seen in the concessions made to avert a civil war on his return from Rome. In Story's view [...] "his legacy has been clouded by accusations of excessive piety which (to modern sensibilities at least) <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> at odds with the demands of early medieval kingship". In 839 an unnamed Anglo-Saxon king wrote to the Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious asking for permission to travel through his territory on the way to Rome, and relating an English priest's dream which foretold disaster unless Christians abandoned their sins. This is now believed to have been an unrealised project of Egbert {{at the end of his}} life, but it was formerly attributed to Æthelwulf, and seen as exhibiting what Story calls his reputation for [...] "dramatic piety", and irresponsibility for planning to abandon his kingdom at the beginning of his reign.|$|E
