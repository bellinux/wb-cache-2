Some of the pioneer railway builders were self-taught, but others had gained their engineering experience constructing canals, or in military service. In Britain, the Institution of Civil Engineers had been founded in London in 1818, with Thomas Telford as its first president and its formation pre-dated many of the railway schemes. It obtained a Royal Charter in 1828. Later, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers was formed in 1847, with George Stephenson as its first president. The Corps of Royal Engineers, a British military organisation, was older than both of these civilian engineering institutions and it had extensive experience of (military) railway operations. For this reason, for almost 150 years from its foundation by the Board of Trade in 1840, Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate recruited suitably qualified retired officers from the Corps into its [...] "senior" [...] arm, as railway inspecting officers. These officers retained their former military rank within the Inspectorate. It was to be 1985 before a railway inspecting officer without a previous military career was appointed: the officer transferred across from the [...] "junior" [...] arm: as a former railway <b>employment</b> <b>inspector.</b> Over the same period, of almost {{a century and a}} half, the Inspectorate was headed by a retired officer of the Corps of Royal Engineers as its chief inspecting officer. Other, former army officers, such as Charles Blacker Vignoles, were to gain new careers on the railways when they became under-employed after the Napoleonic War.|$|E

Asquith, it was the culmination of legislation enacted in the 19th century.The Act amended and consolidated the law related to coal mines, including the Act of 1887 and subsequent regulations. It embodied legislation in the United Kingdom regarding the management of mines, safety provisions, health, accidents, regulations, <b>employment,</b> <b>inspectors</b> and other subjects. The Act and other reforms by the Liberal government had the effect of weakening the Labour Party's independence. The Labour Party had to support the Liberal reforms, and was therefore criticised by revolutionary socialists and syndicalists.|$|R
