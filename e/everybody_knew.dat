25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that <b>everybody</b> <b>knew.</b> He {{was a kind}} of a household word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine {{was one of the great}} popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did. You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, King Alfonso XIII of Spain made an {{official}} state {{visit to the}} United Kingdom. Victoria Eugenie's uncle, King Edward VII, hosted a dinner in Buckingham Palace, in honour of the Spanish king. Alfonso was seated between Queen Alexandra and Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, King Edward's sister. He noticed Victoria Eugenie and asked who the dinner guest with almost white hair was. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knew</b> that King Alfonso {{was looking for a}} suitable bride and one of the strongest candidates was Princess Patricia of Connaught, daughter of King Edward's brother, the Duke of Connaught. As Princess Patricia seemed not to be impressed by the Spanish monarch, Alfonso indulged his interest in Victoria Eugenie, and so the courtship began. When Alfonso returned to Spain he frequently sent postcards to Victoria Eugenie and spoke of her approvingly. His widowed mother, Queen Maria Cristina, did not like her son's choice, in part because she considered the Battenbergs non-royal because of the obscure origin of Prince Henry's mother, and in part because she wanted her son to marry within her own family, the Habsburgs from Austria. Another obstacle to a marriage was Victoria Eugenie's Protestantism (Alfonso was Roman Catholic; she was Anglican). Another potential problem was haemophilia, the disease that Victoria had transmitted to some of her descendants. Eugenie's brother Leopold was a haemophiliac, so there was a 50% probability that Victoria Eugenie would be a carrier, although the degree of risk was not yet known. Still, if Alfonso married her, their issue could be affected by the disease. Nonetheless, Alfonso was not dissuaded.|$|E
500|$|... "Saddlesore Galactica" [...] {{was written}} by Tim Long and {{directed}} by Lance Kramer {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). The title is a reference to the science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica. The idea of Duncan originally being a diving horse was inspired by an actual diving horse that used to jump into a pool at Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century; a postcard showing this horse was used as a reference by the animators for the scenes featuring the diving. When the animation process began, Kramer drew instructions to his animators on how horses move when they run and how their ankles work. He has said that because Duncan was a large part of the story, [...] "we wanted him to have somewhat of a personality. So when <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> how to draw the horse and we got that out of the way, they could animate the horse acting." [...] Voice artist Jim Cummings provided the animal sounds made by Duncan in the episode.|$|E

500|$|Following The Inside, Nichols {{found work}} on the fifth season of the serial action series Alias in 2005, being cast that July. Nichols starred as Rachel Gibson, a {{computer}} expert who thought she {{was working for the}} CIA when in fact she was working for a dangerous terrorist organization—a situation {{similar to that of the}} series' main character Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) in the first season. Discovering the truth, Gibson joins the real CIA and becomes Bristow's protégée. Of working on Alias, Nichols said that [...] "to say it's the nicest set on the planet is an understatement". Her role involved multiple fight sequences, as did Garner's. Nichols worked with Garner's personal trainer; she said she [...] "already knew that [...] job was extremely hard. But I didn't know how difficult it was until I started training for just one fight." [...] Nichols was being groomed to replace Garner as the main character due to the latter's pregnancy, which had been written into the storyline. But Alias was canceled in November 2005, making its fifth season its final. [...] "I think <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> that the show wouldn't work without Jennifer", Nichols said, [...] "But still, they were grooming me, so it was heartbreaking when it happened." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Zebras" [...] {{was written}} by Amanda Green and Daniel Truly, and {{directed}} by Peter Leto. The surprise twist in the episode, in which forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran is killed by fellow technician Dale Stuckey, was conceived by Neal Baer, the series executive producer and showrunner. Baer said the decision to kill the character in the story [...] "just came to [...] one day" [...] and thought that [...] "this may be a really interesting way to bring [...] cast together and deal with this story point". In particular, Baer {{said he wanted to}} kill a long-recurring character so the show could [...] "explore characters' reactions to a death in an interesting way". Mike Doyle, the actor who played O'Halloran, was notified about the decision by Baer in a phone call {{a few weeks before the}} episode was filmed in May 2009. Baer said Doyle and the rest of the cast took the news well because, in his words, [...] "I think <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> that somebody was going, so they weren't shocked." [...] During a May 2009 interview, Baer hinted at the twist by telling media outlets that the season finale would include a surprise ending: [...] "One of our own is murdered." ...|$|E
500|$|Favreau {{planned to}} cast a {{newcomer}} in the title role, as [...] "those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is the star. The success of X-Men and Spider-Man without being star-driven pieces reassures [...] that the film does have an upside commercially." [...] However, in September 2006, Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the role. Favreau chose Downey, {{a fan of the}} comic, because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining [...] "The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark." [...] Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not take no for an answer, saying, [...] "It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> he was talented [...] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways. While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by Elon Musk. Downey said, [...] "Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with, or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans." ...|$|E

500|$|As in {{the case}} of the first Mortal Kombat game, the content of Mortal Kombat II became the subject of a great deal of {{controversy}} regarding violent video games. Nancian Cherry of Toledo Blade wrote that both games had [...] "an army of critics too: people upset by the bone-crunching, blood-spurting, limb-ripping violence depicted on the small screen." [...] According to IGN, [...] "Mortal Kombat II wore its notoriety as a badge of honor, boasting about it in promotional materials, and even parodying it in-game." [...] The game was banned in Germany, where MKII was put in the index by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons (BPjM) and all versions of the game except for the Game Boy version were subjected to being confiscated from the nation's market for violating the German Penal Code by showing excessive violence and cruel acts against representations of human beings. Due to regional censorship, the game was also released with green-colored blood and black-and-white fatality sequences in Japan; it was at that time a unique occurrence of a western game being censored in Japan, not the reverse. Years later, Boon recalled: [...] "I've always had the position that the rating system was a good idea and should be put in place. Once Mortal Kombat II came out, there was a rating system in place. We were an M-rated game, and <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> the content that was in there, so it became almost a non-issue." [...] Tobias agreed, saying that they [...] "were content with the M for mature on our packaging." ...|$|E
500|$|While Cox {{was working}} with Deerhunter to produce Cryptograms, it was {{considered}} Kranky policy to not print the lyrics of an album in its liner notes. [...] This was a rule enforced by label owner Joel Leoschke, who believed the practice [...] "demystifi {{the experience of a}} rock record." [...] Despite largely agreeing with this sentiment, Cox chose to print the lyrics of Let the Blind Lead, in part because he wanted to [...] "see what they looked like," [...] having ad-libbed the words of every song on their first take. [...] In an interview with Pitchfork Media, Cox described the lyrical origins of each song on Let the Blind Lead; they are largely autobiographical in nature, reflecting life experiences of his. The song [...] "Recent Bedroom" [...] conveys an experience Cox had when his aunt died: [...] "She was in her bedroom, and <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> she was about to pass away, and she went out, she faded out, and everybody just started crying." [...] Although he was [...] "overwhelmed" [...] by her death, it did not bring him to tears like the rest of his family. This event is expressed in the song by the lines [...] "I walked outside, I could not cry / I don’t know, I don’t know why". [...] Cox’s inability to cry stemmed from his having been [...] "very involved in drugs" [...] at the time, which he believes eliminated his [...] "childhood instinct…to cry." [...] The song attempts to communicate an emotional vacancy and sense of detachment characterized by [...] "moving from childhood to adolescence".|$|E

They knew that if he could only survive two balls they would see something in batting unknown to any textbook.” Bateman added, “when it was time to get his pads on, Eric would prop his bat up in the Edgbaston dressing room window and say to it: ‘Now while I’m getting ready, you find out what the ball’s doing’”.|$|E
2500|$|Miracles {{bass singer}} Pete Moore told the Cleveland Plain Dealer, [...] "It was {{a slap in}} the face, very disappointing. We are the premier group of Motown. We were there before there was a Motown. We set the pace for all the other artists to come after us. We were a little older, and the other artists looked up to us. How could we not be in there?" [...] Moore later stated, [...] "When Terry Stewart [...] called and told me we were to be inducted, he was apologetic," [...] Moore said. [...] "He said it should have been done years ago, <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> it. He said they {{received}} many, many calls over the years from angry (Miracles) fans." ...|$|E
2500|$|He co-starred as Humphrey Bogart's younger brother, a {{carefree}} playboy, in Sabrina (1954), {{played by}} Audrey Hepburn. It was Holden's third film with director Billy Wilder. Holden and Hepburn became romantically involved during the filming, unbeknown to Wilder: [...] "People {{on the set}} told me later that Bill and Audrey were having an affair, and <b>everybody</b> <b>knew.</b> Well, not everybody! I didn't know." [...] The interactions between Bogart, Hepburn, and Holden made shooting less than pleasant, however, as Bogart originally had wanted his wife, Lauren Bacall, to play Sabrina. While Bogart was, therefore, not especially friendly toward Hepburn, who had little Hollywood experience, Holden's reaction was the opposite, writes biographer Michelangelo Capua.|$|E
