He appeared on Larry King Live four days before the election and endorsed George W. Bush for president. Despite his earlier opposition to NAFTA, Perot remained largely silent about expanded use of guest-worker visas in the United States, with Buchanan supporters attributing this silence to <b>his</b> <b>corporate</b> reliance on foreign workers.

500|$|Hanna quickly {{realized}} that the currency issue struck an emotional chord in many Americans, and decided on a campaign to persuade the voter that [...] "sound money", the gold standard unless modified by international agreement, was much preferable to bimetallism. Such propaganda would not be cheap, as {{before the age of}} television and radio, the most effective way of reaching the electorate was through the written word, and through public speakers who would address meetings on behalf of the candidate. This would take money, and Hanna undertook to secure it from <b>his</b> <b>corporate</b> connections. As Hanna began his fundraising efforts in late July, the Populists met in St. Louis.

500|$|On 23 March 1991, Knight was {{suddenly}} replaced as CAD director by Senior State Counsel Lawrence Ang {{in a decision}} that shocked the local legal community. It turned out that Knight was {{under investigation by the}} Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). After an investigation lasting more than two months—one of the longest probes into the conduct of a public servant in Singapore—Knight was arrested on 27 May 1991 and charged with corruption the next day. He was the first Singapore legal officer to face such charges. Specifically, he was accused of cheating three businessmen into investing S$3,000,000 each into the former Batam Island Country Club on the Indonesian island of Batam, as well as giving false information to the CPIB regarding vehicle purchases, an application for a car loan, and <b>his</b> <b>corporate</b> investments. The judge originally set Knight's trial to commence in October 1992, but changed his mind and brought it forward to September 1991 after the prosecution complained that its witnesses had been subject to intimidation, and investigating officers had received mysterious phone calls warning them to [...] "watch out". In July that year, his wife and two others were also arrested and charged over the Batam resort investments.|$|E
500|$|In September, Hughes and <b>his</b> <b>corporate</b> president, Ned E. Depinet, {{sold their}} RKO studio stock to a Chicago-based {{syndicate}} with {{no experience in}} the movie business. Once Hughes learned that said company had connections to organized crime, he gained near-total control of the studio in February 1953 {{at a cost of}} $23.5 million, becoming the first virtual sole owner of a studio since Hollywood's pioneer days. The studio's net loss in 1952 was over $10 million, and shooting had taken place for just a single in-house production over the last five months of the year. During the turmoil, Samuel Goldwyn ended his 11-year-long distribution deal with RKO. Wald and Krasna escaped their contracts and the studio as well. The deal that brought the team to RKO had called for them to produce sixty features over five years; in just shy of half that time, they succeeded in making four. The RKO Encino movie ranch shut down permanently in 1954 and the property was sold off. [...] Jack Webb's NBC television series Dragnet was the last project to film on the rundown movie ranch for an episode entitled [...] "The Big Producer", where the lot played the part of a crumbling [...] "Westside Studios". In November, Hughes finally fulfilled his obligations under the 1948 consent decree, divesting RKO Theatres; Albert A. List purchased the controlling interest in the business and renamed it List Industries. Hughes soon found himself the target of no less than five separate lawsuits filed by minority shareholders in RKO, accusing him of malfeasance in his dealings with the Chicago group and a wide array of acts of mismanagement. [...] "RKO's contract list is down to three actors and 127 lawyers", quipped Dick Powell of Four Star.|$|E
