5|$|The {{headland}} {{is primarily}} covered with grass, {{as well as}} heather (Calluna vulgaris), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), thyme (Thymus polytrichus) and western gorse (Ulex gallii). In 1962, specimens of the comparatively rare western clover (Trifolium occidentale) were found on Zennor Head. The lichen Dirina massiliensis has also been found high on the acid schist cliffs on the north-, seaward-side of the headland. The parasitic plant dodder (Cuscuta epithymum) is found growing on gorse. There are also typical coastal flowering plants such as <b>kidney</b> <b>vetch</b> (Anthyllis vulneraria), sea campion (Silene uniflora), and thrift (Armeria maritima).|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the fort}} and warren is now grassy slopes which attract {{a wide range of}} wild flowers and butterflies. The differing soil types provide {{suitable}} habitats for both acid- and lime-loving plants. <b>Kidney</b> <b>vetch</b> (Anthyllis vulneraria), harebell (Campanula rotundifolia) and woolly thistle (Cirsium eriophorum) thrive on the dry stony soils. Heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile) and wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia) are found in more acidic areas. The higher areas support bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and common heather (Calluna vulgaris). Trees and shrubs include the wayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana), guelder rose (Viburnum opulus), whitebeam (Sorbus aria), privet (Ligustrum vulgare) and dogwood (Cornus sanguinea).|$|E
2500|$|Some relict {{species from}} the glacial age {{are among the}} flora palette of the Stora Alvaret.

50|$|Legumes {{included}} the lentil, chickpea, black bean, <b>kidney</b> bean, bitter <b>vetch,</b> broad bean, garden pea, and grass pea; Pliny names varieties {{such as the}} Venus pea, and poets praise Egyptian lentils imported from Pelusium. Legumes were planted in rotation with cereals to enrich the soil, and were stockpiled in case of famine. The agricultural writer Columella gives detailed instructions on curing lentils, and Pliny says they had health benefits. Although usually thought of as modest fare, legumes also appear among the dishes at banquets.|$|R
50|$|Turkish-Iranian and Mediterranean plant {{geography}} dominates {{the area that}} Akyatan lagoon is situated. Variety of living environments, provides the evolution of plant species that have different ecological inclination.
