25|$|Furthermore, Burr {{was unsure}} of Hamilton's {{intentions}} (as historians still are today). Seeing Hamilton fire <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> above his head, Burr {{could not be}} sure if Hamilton had thrown away his shot or simply missed his target. According to the principles of the code duello, Burr was entirely justified in taking aim at Hamilton, under the hypothesis that Hamilton had shot first. Continuing this line of reasoning, {{it is not clear that}} Burr did more than react to hearing Hamilton fire before he had any time to realize where the shot had gone.|$|E
25|$|In August 1982, Atlanta {{police officer}} Keith Torick issued Michael Hardwick a {{citation}} for public drinking after witnessing Hardwick throw a beer bottle <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> along Monroe Ave, thereby observing him violating the city’s ordinance that prohibits drinking in public. Due to a clerical error, Hardwick missed his court date and Torick obtained {{a warrant for}} Hardwick's arrest. Hardwick then settled the matter by paying the $50 fine, but Torick showed up at Hardwick's apartment three weeks later to serve the now-invalid warrant. Hardwick’s roommate was sleeping {{on the couch in}} the living room. The roommate invited officers in and directed them down the hall to Hardwick’s room. The door was open and the officers observed Hardwick and a companion engaged in mutual, consensual oral sex.|$|E

The amount of hydroxyl reactive groups incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> was varied by changing the composition of the monomer mixture. These coatings were subsequently functionalized by a natural antibacterial peptide, magainin I, via an oriented chemical grafting on hydroxyl groups, which maintains the activity of the peptide.

2500|$|Williams {{arrived at}} the {{crossing}} on 1 July and learned of the intentions of Watie's force from captured Confederate soldiers. [...] Watie's battle line extended around one mile {{either side of the}} crossing in trenches dug <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> lining the creek. [...] Owing to the unusually high water level in the creek, which reached above shoulder height, Williams chose to delay his attack on the Confederates until the following day and corralled his wagons defensively on a nearby prairie.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{ordered a}} half-hour {{artillery}} bombardment before launching an assault with the Third Indian Home Guard. [...] They {{failed to make}} it across the now waist-deep creek, pushed back by heavy Confederate fire, and so the Ninth Kansas Cavalry were ordered to charge under the covering fire of the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry. [...] With the cavalry having gained a bridgehead across the creek, Williams led the men of his own regiment, the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry, in a headlong charge across the stream and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush.</b> This forced the Confederates back and Williams pursued them {{for a quarter of}} a mile as they attempted to rally in a clearing. [...] Williams then led his convoy to successfully resupply Fort Gibson. [...] Confederate casualties amounted to 65 men killed with the Union Army suffering between 3 and 23 dead with 30 wounded.|$|E

2500|$|As of May 2017, the end {{results of}} 25 years of {{breeding}} to reawaken the hunting instinct {{have been a}} success. It has resulted in dogs that are very eager to please their masters. It {{has resulted in a}} gun dog with extreme intelligence, a relentless drive to catch its quarry, and strong swimming skills that requires special training: their aptitude is second only to the British Border Collie and thus the hunting Standard Poodle requires the gunman to be quite specific as to what he wants and how he wants it done. Unlike other spaniels and retrievers, Standard Poodles will attempt to solve a problem independently and need to be told specifically what is wanted when tracking and retrieving a bird. Because they are highly intelligent, harsh or violent training methods do not work with this dog breed in the field-corrections must be timely, given with precision and the trainer must have a firm but kind hand; an overbearing owner training his dog to hunt will find his Standard poodle terrified of his master and the entire experience, and refusing to budge an inch towards the water or <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{featured}} various {{references to}} the popular culture. The episode title is taken from the official Spanish title for the series. While at the Veterans Day parade, Peter hears Herbert sing [...] "God Bless The USA" [...] by Lee Greenwood. When at the bar, Peter said he got a tattoo of the Space Shuttle on his penis and Quagmire in his head {{said he was going}} to do it and plays [...] "I Love a Rainy Night" [...] by Eddie Rabbitt. When Peter acts like a super U.S. Patriot he terminates anything associated with illegal immigration, such as arresting Brian's 85-year-old Korean Buddhist accupuncturist and discarding Stewie's Speedy Gonzales video. During the scene in which Peter and Brian are talking about immigrants, Peter says that [...] "they are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take 'em away!" [...] This is a reference to a line spoken by Darth Vader to Princess Leia in the movie Star Wars. The party Peter is invited to is the celebration of Cinco de Mayo. The scene in which Peter is hired as a babysitter of two children is a reference to the film Mary Poppins. When taking the immigration test, Peter is asked who founded America to which he replies [...] "Dick York" [...] but then quickly changes his answer to [...] "Dick Sargent". This is a reference to the two actors who played Darrin Stephens on the 1960s television show Bewitched. [...] Quagmire considers getting a tattoo in the shape of the Space Needle. John McCain is referenced. The ending to the film Dirty Dancing is referenced. While Peter is seen sacrificing a goat in the name of Toby Keith, it is seen gone and a hat slowly disappearing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush,</b> is reference to Jurassic Park with the Tyrannosaurus eating the goat. Also, during that scene, Lois says [...] "Toby Keith doesn't want to be fed. Toby Keith wants to hunt." [...] is a parody of the quote [...] "T-Rex does not want to be fed, he wants to hunt." [...] in Jurassic Park. The mouse that Peter had created, [...] "Rapid Dave" [...] is a parody of the Looney Tunes character Speedy Gonzales.|$|E

50|$|In the past, repulsion-start wound-rotor motors {{provided}} high starting torque, {{but with}} added complexity. Their rotors {{were similar to}} those of universal motors, but their brushes were connected only to each other. Transformer action induced current <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rotor. <b>Brush</b> position relative to field poles meant that starting torque was developed by rotor repulsion from the field poles. A centrifugal mechanism, when close to running speed, connected all commutator bars together to create the equivalent of a squirrel-cage rotor.

He heard Sir Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of the keeper. The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with faces. There was the trampling of myriad feet, and the low buzz of voices. A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the boughs overhead.|$|R
60|$|It was yet early, {{and the old}} {{man being}} still asleep, she walked out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> churchyard, <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> dew from the long grass with her feet, and often turning aside into places where it grew longer than in others, that she might not tread upon the graves.

60|$|Once in {{the shade}} of the great trees the fever of discontent left him, and, forgetting all except the {{happiness}} of being surrounded by the silent oaks, he penetrated deeper and deeper <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forest. <b>The</b> <b>brushing</b> of a branch against a tree, the thud of a falling nut, the dart of a squirrel, and the sight of a bushy tail disappearing round a limb--all these things which indicated that the little gray fellows were working in the tree-tops, and which would usually have brought Isaac to a standstill, now did not seem to interest him. At times he stooped to examine the tender shoots growing at the foot of a sassafras tree. Then, again, he closely examined marks he found in the soft banks of the streams.|$|R
50|$|The high {{resistance}} or {{carbon brush}} is made large {{enough that it}} is significantly wider than the insulating segment that it spans (and on large machines may often span two insulating segments). The result {{of this is that}} as the commutator segment passes from under <b>the</b> <b>brush,</b> <b>the</b> current passing to it ramps down more smoothly than had been the case with pure copper <b>brushes</b> where <b>the</b> contact broke suddenly. Similarly <b>the</b> segment coming <b>into</b> contact with <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> has a similar ramping up of the current. Thus, although the current passing through <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> was more or less constant, the instantaneous current passing to the two commutator segments was proportional to the relative area in contact with <b>the</b> <b>brush.</b>|$|R
