25|$|In {{order to}} save costs, an {{increasing}} number of polyester intermediate producers like spinning mills, strapping mills, or cast film mills are working on the direct use of the PET-flakes, from the treatment of used bottles, with a view to manufacturing {{an increasing number of}} polyester intermediates. For the adjustment of the necessary viscosity, besides an efficient drying of the flakes, it is possibly necessary to also reconstitute the viscosity through polycondensation in the melt phase or solid-state polycondensation of the flakes. The latest PET flake conversion processes are applying twin screw <b>extruders,</b> multi-screw <b>extruders</b> or multi-rotation systems and coincidental vacuum degassing to remove moisture and avoid flake pre-drying. These processes allow the conversion of undried PET flakes without substantial viscosity decrease caused by hydrolysis.|$|E

The Center for Advanced Manufacturing at the Potchefstroom {{campus of}} the North West University aims to develop a twin screw <b>extruder</b> that is able to process powder coating resin. The {{facility}} has thus far produced various components and sub systems for local and international manufacturers of extrusion products. The research presented in this thesis aims to both develop a twin screw <b>extruder</b> with an integrated cooling roller system and to investigate {{of the performance of}} a twin screw <b>extruder.</b> The development of a twin screw <b>extruder</b> consists of the selection of the drive section of the <b>extruder,</b> the complete design of a twin screw <b>extruder</b> gearbox, the investigation and design of a suitable barrel for the manufacturing of powder coatings as well as the development of a unique cooling roller unit for the forming of the processed product when exiting the <b>extruder.</b> The <b>extruder</b> was manufactured from the designed components and systems. It was found on further testing that it was capable of producing a powder coating resin of good quality. In order to evaluate the performance of an <b>extruder,</b> the transfer of energy through the <b>extruder</b> needs to be understood. Furthermore it is necessary to understand the theory behind each type of energy being consumed by the <b>extruder,</b> as well as the factors influencing the usage of that energy. The theories investigated were verified in practice by measuring the energy consumption of a twin screw <b>extruder</b> operated under various conditions. These tests provided a correlation between the consumption of mechanical and electrical energy. The results gave an indication of the effectiveness of the screw configuration of the processing section of the <b>extruder,</b> making it possible to determine how the configuration should be amended in order to improve the performance of the <b>extruder.</b> The two aims of the thesis were satisfactory completed.

Such polyethylene types offer extremely high stiffness, toughness, strength, stress crack resistance and an increased crack propagation resistance. They consist of equal proportions higher and lower molekularerer polymer fractions. The lower molecular weight units crystallize easier and relax faster. The higher molecular weight fractions form linking molecules between crystallites, thereby increasing toughness and stress crack resistance. Polyethylene with multimodal {{molecular weight distribution}} can be prepared either in two-stage reactors, by catalysts with two different active centers on a carrier or by blending in <b>extruders.</b>|$|E
25|$|For use in {{pharmaceutical}} products, extrusion through nano-porous, polymeric filters {{is being}} used to produce suspensions of lipid vesicles liposomes or transfersomes with a particular size of a narrow size distribution. The anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin in liposome delivery system is formulated by extrusion, for example. Hot melt extrusion is also utilized in pharmaceutical solid oral dose processing to enable delivery of drugs with poor solubility and bioavailability. Hot melt extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier increasing dissolution rates and bioavailability. The process involves the application of heat, pressure and agitation to mix materials together and ‘extrude’ them through a die. Twin-screw high shear <b>extruders</b> blend materials and simultaneously break up particles. The resulting particle can be blended with compression aids and compressed into tablets or filled into unit dose capsules.|$|E

Furthermore,the average shear level is low in a counterrotating twin screw <b>extruder,</b> which prevents degradation of the newly formed polymer to occur.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of phase morphology in uncompatibilized and reactively compatibilized nylon- 6 /ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) blends {{has been investigated}} by scanning electron microscopy with special reference {{to the effect of}} mixer type and size. Three types of mixing instruments were used for the melt preparation of the blends. These include the Haake Rheocord mixer, the DSM twin-screw mini <b>extruder,</b> and the industrial Werner Pfleiderer twin-screw <b>extruder</b> (ZSK- 25). In the reactively compatibilized blends, EPR-g-maleic anhydride (MA) has been used as the compatibilizer precursor. The MA group of the EPR reacts with the amino group of nylon forming a graft copolymer at the interface, which decreases the interfacial tension and suppresses the coalescence. In the case of uncompatibilized blends the final morphology is developed within 3 - 4 min of the mixing time in the DSM twin-screw mini <b>extruder.</b> The size of the dispersed phase in the uncompatibilized blends, as obtained in the Werner Pfleiderer twin-screw <b>extruder</b> and the DSM mini <b>extruder,</b> was found to be smaller than that obtained in the Haake Rheocord mixer on account of elongational flow occurring in the twin-screw <b>extruder.</b> In the case of the Werner Pfleiderer twin screw <b>extruder,</b> sampling was done at various points {{in order to understand the}} {{evolution of}} the phase morphology along the axis of the <b>extruder.</b> It has been found that the final morphology of the uncompatibilized blends in the Werner Pfleiderer <b>extruder</b> is controlled by the geometry of the die at the exit. In the case of reactively compatibilized blends, the morphology development in the DSM twin-screw mini <b>extruder</b> was so fast that the final morphology developed within 30 sec of mixing.
