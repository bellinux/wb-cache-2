50|$|The Borehole Thermal Energy System {{is located}} {{underground}} to store {{large quantities of}} heat collected in the summer {{to be used in}} the winter. It consists of 144 boreholes, which stretch to a depth of 37 m. At the surface the pipes are joined together in groups of six to connect to the Energy Centre. The entire BTES is covered by a layer of insulation, on top of which a park is built. When the heated water is to be stored, it is pumped through the pipe series. The heat is then transferred to the surrounding soil as the water cools and returns to the Energy Centre. When the homes need heat, water flows to the centre of the BTES field and picks up the heat from the surrounding soil. The heated water then goes to the short-term energy tank in the Energy Centre and is pumped through the District <b>Heating</b> <b>Loop</b> to the homes.|$|E
50|$|There are 52 {{homes in}} this {{subdivision}} that contain {{an array of}} 800 solar thermal collectors. These solar collectors are arranged on the roofs of garages located behind the homes.

A glycol solution (an anti-freeze solution; a mixture of water and non-toxic glycol) is heated by the sun’s energy and travels through insulated piping underground through a trench system to the heat exchanger within the community’s Energy Centre. This {{is known as the}} Solar Collector Loop. The glycol solution then transfers its heat to water located in the short-term storage tanks. The District <b>Heating</b> <b>Loop</b> begins with water being heated in the heat exchanger to a temperature of 40-50 °C within the Energy Centre.

40|$|WO 2009098106 A 1 UPAB: 20090824 NOVELTY - The <b>heating</b> <b>loop</b> (41) {{used in the}} new {{turbine blade}} heating unit is seen to be {{generally}} U-shaped, with intentional additional curvatures. Its arrangement is such that a temperature gradient is produced in the fin section of the turbine blade (406). The loop (41) is run close to the blade, {{above and below the}} blade platform (403). Above the platform (403) the loop is run near the blade and is curved to correspond with the blade curvature. The loop is curved below the blade platform, especially in correspondence with the turbine blade curvature above the blade platform. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Only a single <b>heating</b> <b>loop</b> is used. It is led near the blade platform. It is passed near the turbine blade or the blade root. The <b>heating</b> <b>loop</b> is arranged on the suction- and/or pressure side of the blade. The heating unit forms part of welding equipment for a turbine blade. In the new method of welding, the heating unit is used in conjunction with welding equipment (49), especially a laser, to produce a weld seam. Welding is carried out {{on the side of the}} turbine blade where the <b>heating</b> <b>loop</b> runs below the blade platform. The weld seam is intentionally allowed to harden to a DS- or SX-orientated structure. The transition region between turbine blade and platform is welded. In the region to be heated, a powder is coated-on. This is a magnetic powder, especially a magnetic and dielectric powder. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the corresponding welding method. USE - A heating unit used when e. g. welding cracks in turbine blades or removing material from them. ADVANTAGE - Turbine blade welding e. g. re-melts and fuses cracks together, or removes material. Pre-heating precedes welding, to reduce thermally-induced stressing. In prior art, the desired temperature or temperature distribution is not achieved. The new equipment and measures described are used to overcome this problem. Use of only a single <b>heating</b> <b>loop</b> is preferred, since it represents an easily-reproducible arrangement. The magnetic and dielectric powder acts as a concentrator for the <b>heating</b> <b>loop,</b> during the heating operation. Its use masks selectively against welding. The blade is used in e. g. an aviation- or power generation gas turbine, a steam turbine or a compressor. Suitable alloys and structure are also discussed in the disclosure...|$|E

In the UK, similar to many other countries, disused coal mines have untapped potential for low cost green energy due to the flooding of coal mines with water at reasonable warm temperature due to the availability of geothermal energy at different depths. This allows to use water source heat pumps in locations away from rivers and seas for heating and cooling applications. Extracting energy from flooded coal mines using water heat pumps with open loop systems is still relatively a new concept, but can provide much heating capacity due to eliminating the time needed for heat transfer between the external environment and the <b>heating</b> <b>loop</b> in case of closed loop systems. The use of real systems to conduct research could be an expensive task or impractical to users of the application such as {{the residents of the}} served building. On the other hand, computer simulation includes significant assumptions that might not be accurate in many real situations. In this paper, the authors have developed a small scale simulator to help in understanding such energy systems and to conduct research in this field for the benefit of researchers, educators and students within the applied and renewable energy field. The paper describes the detailed design, the complete prototype and initial assessment of the system using infrared thermography and temperature monitoring.

FPSEs are also flexible in configuration {{as they can}} be coupled with many potential heat sources and various heat input systems, heat rejection systems, and power management and distribution systems. Development of a 5 -kWe Stirling Convertor Assembly (SCA) is underway to demonstrate the viability of an FPSE for space power. The design is a scaled-down version of the successful 12. 5 -kWe Component Test Power Converter (CTPC) developed under NAS 3 - 25463. The ultimate efficiency target is 25 % overall convertor efficiency (electrical power out over heat in). For the single cylinder prototype now in development, cost and time constraints required use of economical and readily available materials (steel versus beryllium) and components (a commercially available linear alternator) and thus lower efficiency. The working gas is helium at 150 bar mean pressure. The design consists of a displacer suspended on internally pumped gas bearings and a power piston/alternator supported on flexures. Non-contacting clearance seals are used between internal volumes. Heat to and from the prototype convertor is done via pumped liquid loops passing through shell and tube heat exchangers.

For high current beam operations inorganic scintillators were investigated and numerical analysis of the recorded images was performed. The light yield, imaged beam width and higher statistical moments show strong dependence on the scintillating materials deployed [1, 2] and their temperature. Detailed temperature {{studies were carried out}} using a Ni layer (as a <b>heating</b> <b>loop)</b> sputtered on the backside of the ZrO 2 screen. Additionally, the spectral response of the materials was mapped for different temperature levels (RT- 300 o C), using a spectrometer. During the measurements, heating power was kept constant but the temperature of the sample was increasing due to the energy deposition of the impinging ion beam. As shown in Fig. 1 the light yield and imaged beam width for ZrO 2 irradiated by the proton beam increase with temperature, except the initial phase which is difficult to interpret. In the temperature range from 125 - 250 o C, the light yield increases by the factor of 4 and the imaged beam width by 1. 5. These results clearly point out that the temperature of the scintillators is critical for high current operations. Spectra of the scintillation light show a temperature dependance [3] as depiced in Fig. 2. For the broad band at 480 nm a slight shift to higher wavelengths is observed during the heating process. The bands around 400 and 725 nm are affected by the temperature, as well. For the spectra obtained with the proton beam, a sharp line around 515 nm occurred which is not observed for T a 24 + beam. Additionally, this line is not influenced by the change of screen temperature (Fig. 2). Several scintillating materials like Al 2 O 3, Quartz etc. were investigated under various beam conditions (H + as well as heavy elements up to U 28 +).

It can carry higher power over longer distances by having co-current liquid and vapor flow, {{in contrast to the}} counter-current flow in a heat pipe. This allows the wick in a <b>loop</b> <b>heat</b> pipe to be required only in the evaporator and compensation chamber. Micro <b>loop</b> <b>heat</b> pipes have been developed and successfully employed in a wide sphere of applications both on the ground and in space.|$|R
