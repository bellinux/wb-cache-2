500|$|Terrance Kean, {{who lived}} in a nearby {{apartment}} building, heard the noise of loud jet engines, <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> his window, and saw a [...] "very, very large passenger jet". He watched [...] "it just plow right {{into the side of the}} Pentagon. The nose penetrated into the portico. And then it sort of disappeared, and there was fire and smoke everywhere." [...] Tim Timmerman, who is a pilot himself, noticed American Airlines markings on the aircraft as he saw it hit the Pentagon. Other drivers on Washington Boulevard, Interstate 395, and Columbia Pike witnessed the crash, as did people in Pentagon City, Crystal City, and other nearby locations.|$|E
500|$|On September 22, 1851, Minot was in {{a parked}} {{passenger}} train at Turner Station. He <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> {{the window of the}} train and saw the new telegraph wires. Departing the train, Minot ran into the station, got on the new telegraph, and wired the next station along the line, Monroe, to see if the eastbound train to Piermont-on-Hudson had gone past. The station agent said no. At that point, Minot ordered the engineer of the train to proceed on their way to Goshen. The engineer refused to take Minot's order, and instead, Minot got into the cab car himself and drove the train himself to Port Jervis, hours ahead of the planned scheduled time of arrival. This was the second of the several [...] "firsts" [...] the Erie Railroad created in its time, along with the shipment of milk by rail at Chester station in 1842. The use of the telegraph and Minot's system remained until 1888, when a new system of block signaling, developed by the competitor Pennsylvania Railroad, helped expand Minot's use of telecommunications to control rail traffic.|$|E
2500|$|Suddenly, Comdr. Carpenter hollered, [...] "Hard left rudder." [...] I {{reversed}} the rudder, but the momentum was still carrying {{the ship to}} the right. The ship shuddered for several seconds and slowly started to turn left when an immense explosion took place. I <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> the porthole and all I could see was a huge cloud in the direction the Juneau had been.|$|E
60|$|He {{gave me a}} sidelong <b>glance</b> <b>out</b> of his {{sinister}} red eyes, and laughed.|$|R
60|$|While {{they were}} eating Dick {{happened}} to <b>glance</b> <b>out</b> of the show window of the place and gave a low cry.|$|R
60|$|SECOND ENGINEER--[Forcing a smile.] Two {{are better}} than one. [Disturbed by her eyes, <b>glances</b> <b>out</b> to sea--blurts out.] A fine day we're having.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly thereafter, however, Lt. Comdr. Carpenter, the ship's navigator, who seldom {{left the}} bridge, shouted, [...] "Hard right rudder, DeLong." [...] I spun the rudder over hard right and started singing out the course changes every ten degrees. I <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> the {{porthole}} as the bow swung past {{the line of}} sight to the Juneau {{who had been on}} our starboard quarter in the formation. The ship was swinging at a rapid speed now and I {{had no idea what was}} going on.|$|E
60|$|Winthrop <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> {{across the}} great, level plain, {{and his face}} grew set.|$|E
60|$|I <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> of the window. For {{many reasons}} I {{did not wish}} to prolong this interview.|$|E
60|$|He {{shook his}} head mournfully over the brother's hand. At this moment Mark, who had been <b>glancing</b> <b>out</b> of the window, left the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] said Maud Barrington, <b>glancing</b> <b>out</b> {{across the}} prairie which was growing dusky now, [...] "why {{you took the}} trouble to call them up for me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That she is still. I {{never saw}} my sister so much struck with any one. There is {{something}} so striking in her bright <b>glance</b> <b>out</b> of those clear eyes." ...|$|R
60|$|Tarzan {{understood}} the plan instantly. He <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> of half-closed eyes at Jane, {{but he did}} not move.|$|E
60|$|There was a moment's silence. Louise {{had looked}} down at her plate, and Sophy <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> of the window.|$|E
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> of {{the window}} at the serene sky and sunlit garden, and then nervously at his cousin's face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, <b>glancing</b> <b>out</b> of {{the corner}} of his eye to be sure that Laura was there, [...] "let me show you what I have just discovered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The maid with my frock, thank heavens!" [...] Lady Cynthia announced, <b>glancing</b> <b>out</b> of the window. [...] "My last {{anxiety is}} removed. I {{am looking forward}} now to a {{wonderful}} night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Pierre," [...] {{said his}} mother, <b>glancing</b> <b>out</b> at the window, [...] "are {{you going to}} Santa Fe De Bogota with that {{enormous}} old phaeton;--what do you take that Juggernaut out for?" ...|$|R
60|$|Hal <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> of the window. It was tightly closed, and the {{distance}} to the court below was fully twenty feet.|$|E
60|$|Maraton <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> of the window. There was a hurrying crowd fast {{approaching}} {{the front of}} the hotel. He drew back.|$|E
60|$|The girl <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> {{beneath the}} awnings across the sun-scorched {{littoral}} towards the blue ridge of the inland plateau before she answered him.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{few minutes}} there was silence, which Ramiro, <b>glancing</b> <b>out</b> of the lattice, broke by {{remarking}} that [...] "The snowfall was extraordinarily heavy for the time of year." [...] Then followed another silence.|$|R
60|$|The man {{was unusually}} loquacious for a western {{railroad}} hand, and Nevis, {{who had been}} <b>glancing</b> <b>out</b> at the shadowy sweep of prairie, amid which the straight track lost itself, felt inclined to talk.|$|R
60|$|Near {{the corner}} to which Jerry had retreated was an open window. <b>Glancing</b> <b>out</b> of it {{he saw that the}} roof of the next {{building}} was but six or eight feet below the window sill.|$|R
6000|$|Eugenia, who {{was near}} the window, <b>glanced</b> <b>out,</b> {{listening}} a moment. [...] "The matter--the matter"--she answered. [...] "But you don't say such things here." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{walked to}} the window, <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> of it, made up her mind, turned and came towards him, with her hands clasped behind her back.|$|E
60|$|A quick flush {{covered the}} stranger's cheek, and his eyebrows {{momentarily}} contracted. He walked carelessly to the window, however, <b>glanced</b> <b>out,</b> {{and then turned}} to Don Jose.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{was passing}} through the little {{entryway}} that leads into the kitchen I happened to <b>glance</b> <b>out</b> {{of the window and}} I saw four or five fellows down {{at the foot of the}} fire-escape." ...|$|R
60|$|At the {{imminent}} risk of something inside giving way under the strain, Mr. Vickers restrained himself. He breathed hard, and <b>glancing</b> <b>out</b> of window sought {{to regain his}} equilibrium by becoming interested in a blackbird outside.|$|R
60|$|It had, indeed, {{increased}} {{during the}} few hours since dawn {{to a very}} violent tempest. The panes of the window rattled and shook. <b>Glancing</b> <b>out,</b> Dolly saw cabbage leaves and straw whirling up past the casement.|$|R
60|$|The Hired Retainer {{scratched}} {{his chin and}} <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> of the window. The moon was up, and the garden looked cool and mysterious in the dim light.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All right; Don never lies.' And Dan {{gave the}} tall beast a hug, adding as he <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> of the window, {{where a man}} and horse were seen approaching: ...|$|E
60|$|Anna stopped short. Suddenly she understood. She grew {{perhaps a}} shade paler, and she <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> into the street, where her four-wheeler cab, laden with luggage, was still waiting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is a rattle-snake accountable?" [...] {{asked the}} {{stranger}} {{with such a}} preternaturally cold, gemmy <b>glance</b> <b>out</b> of his pellucid blue eye, that he seemed more a metaphysical merman than a feeling man; [...] "is a rattle-snake accountable?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then," [...] {{continued}} M. Pelet, [...] "the eyelid will flicker, the light-coloured lashes {{be lifted}} a second, {{and a blue}} eye, <b>glancing</b> <b>out</b> from under the screen, will take its brief, sly, searching survey, and retreat again." ...|$|R
60|$|When the man {{had started}} to speak his voice had carried into the reading-room, and much {{surprised}} to think others were so near, both Haskers and Merwell had gotten up from the couch to <b>glance</b> <b>out</b> of the window.|$|R
