5|$|Francium-223 is {{the most}} stable isotope, with a {{half-life}} of 21.8minutes, and it <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the actinium decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1149keV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4MeV decay energy).|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, the {{smallest}} possible object that could possess an absolute magnitude of +1 (a perfectly reflective {{one with an}} albedo of 1) would be 838km in diameter. It <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> any body of this size or larger, regardless of composition, would not also surpass whatever threshold is ultimately adopted as proof of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, {{if it turns out}} upon further investigation that an object named {{as if it were a}} plutoid has not achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, the IAU has stated it will be reclassified, but keep its name.|$|E

25|$|During the Syrian Occupation of Lebanon (1976–2005), it <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> Lebanon {{would sign}} {{a peace treaty}} with Israel before Syria, as Syria's {{influence}} on Lebanese politics was strong; however, the Syrian Occupation withdrew from Lebanon, yet the Iran–Syria–Hezbollah axis remained through the heavy arms presence.|$|R
50|$|Observing the {{structure}} of the skull, its characteristics were nearly identical to that of the indigenous people of the region. From a morphological standpoint, scientists argued <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> a species could last through an entire geological period (several thousands of years) without any evolutionary modifications or changes.|$|R
5|$|The ancient Egyptians mummified many animal species, from {{cats and}} gazelles to crocodiles, baboons, and birds. Typically, many animal species were {{consumed}} as meat after death, but it <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> dogs {{would have been}} eaten. Radiographs of exhumed dogs {{in the ancient world}} have revealed that the mummification process involved wrapping the embalmed bones together with bandages and placing them within a wooden statue of Anubis, the jackal-headed deity associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} Pacific Coast {{breakpoints}} in the United States. They are, {{from north to}} south, Point Piedras Blancas, Point Sal, Point Conception, Point Mugu, {{the mouth of the}} San Gabriel River, San Mateo Point, and the mouth of the Tijuana River (although places outside this area can be selected if conditions warrant). Should there be the threat of landfall, warnings or watches would be issued for those sections of coast. It <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> any tropical cyclone will threaten areas farther north due to the stronger influence of the California Current.|$|E
5|$|However, it <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> single-story {{structures}} such as {{mobile homes}} can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> {{a chassis}} {{would leave the}} works with the same body, engine or gearbox that it entered with.

Warren recovered and went on to be recruited to play college basketball.|$|R
50|$|The FBI became {{involved}} in the investigation along with the French authorities and concluded that Dele, Karlan and Saldo were probably killed and then thrown overboard, or forced to walk off the boat into the ocean, by Dabord.

5|$|Thucydides {{says that}} 200 Phoenician ships were {{captured}} and destroyed. It <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> this {{occurred during the}} apparently brief naval battle, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the battle and destroyed with fire, {{as has been the}} case at Mycale. Plutarch says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled. It is possible that 'destroyed' in this context means sunk during the battle, since the Greeks would almost certainly have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as Thucydides indeed implies). Since Thucydides only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile Plutarch's and Thucydides's numbers, {{but it is not clear}} that this is the best approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side.|$|E
5|$|The coins {{struck by}} Beonna's last known moneyer, Wilred, are so {{different}} from Efe's that it <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> they were produced at the same mint or at the same time. It can also be assumed that Wilred is the same moneyer who struck coins for Offa of Mercia, possibly at Ipswich. Wilred's coins {{can be used to}} demonstrate that Offa's influence over the East Angles occurred at an earlier date than has previously been supposed, but are of little use in determining a secure chronology for Beonna's reign. Wilred's name is always depicted in runes. Nearly all his reverse dies have two crosses placed between the elements of his name (+ wil + red): most of the obverse dies show crosses and the king's name in a similar design, but also include an extra rune. This unique rune, similar to ᚹ, possibly meant walda ('ruler').|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> this {{reaction}} {{will be able}} to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of einsteinium-254, which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms,Es|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=122|pages=411–417|year=1986|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(86)90435-2|first10=R.

L.|displayauthors=9}} to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories, and in quantities smaller than those needed for effective synthesis of ultraheavy elements. However, given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table, it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions, and indeed attempts to synthesise it in 2019 and 2020 are currently planned at laboratories at Japan and Russia. Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet, and it is also possible, due to drip instabilities, that only the lower period 8 elements, up to around element 128, are physically possible. No attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals, such as unhexpentium, due to their extremely high atomic number: they would require new, more powerful technology to make.|$|E

25|$|Gat {{wrote that}} frantic Jewish {{registration}} for denaturalisation and departure {{was driven by}} knowledge that the denaturalisation law was due to expire in March 1951.

In 1668, Carlo Rainaldi returned as architect and Ciro Ferri received the commission to fresco the dome interior which it <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> Borromini intended. Further large scale statuary and coloured marbling were also added; again, these are not part of Borromini’s design repertoire which was orientated to white stucco architectural and symbolic motifs.|$|E
