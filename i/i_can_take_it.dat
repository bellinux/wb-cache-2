2500|$|In a {{parallel}} plot line, Oberon, {{king of the}} fairies, and Titania, his queen, {{have come to the}} forest outside Athens. Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding. Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian changeling to Oberon for use as his [...] "knight" [...] or [...] "henchman," [...] since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers. Oberon seeks to punish Titania's disobedience. He calls upon Robin [...] "Puck" [...] Goodfellow, his [...] "shrewd and knavish sprite," [...] to help him concoct a magical juice derived from a flower called [...] "love-in-idleness," [...] which turns from white to purple when struck by Cupid's arrow. When the concoction is applied to the eyelids of a sleeping person, that person, upon waking, falls in love with the first living thing he perceives. He instructs Puck to retrieve the flower with the hope that he might make Titania fall in love with an animal of the forest and thereby shame her into giving up the little Indian boy. He says, [...] "And ere I take this charm from off her sight,/As <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> with another herb,/I'll make her render up her page to me." ...|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the verses}} Hine added was the current third verse:And when I think that God, His Son not sparing, Sent Him to die, <b>I</b> scarce <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> in; That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing, He bled and died {{to take away}} my sin.|$|R
2500|$|In 2011 and 2012, {{band members}} {{continued}} with the sentiment {{that it was}} possible, depending mostly on everyone's schedule. In a November 2011 interview, Patrick said {{of the future of}} the band: Those guys are amazing, it's basically this simple: Robert has a studio in his basement where he can totally do his old-fashioned kind of classic sound. They can write and record at any moment in time, they can get Ray Luzier in to play drums and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> {{for a week or two}} and write vocals or sing it. So it's as easy as them kind of recording everything, which is actually probably tough because they're constantly working with Scott on Stone Temple Pilot stuff. So the band is always there, you know what I mean, we're alive, we talk, Dean and I are constantly in communication. Ray Luzier, every time I see him he's like [...] "Man that Army of Anyone record is still, people still come up to me and talk about that Army of Anyone record". And I think that I honestly could probably do a way better job just 'cause of what I've learned lately as a singer...I think the best Army of Anyone record is still to come, it's still totally doable and could be even better.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes? Well, {{of course}} some people do. Prohibition and all that. Personally, it doesn't affect me. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> {{or leave it}} alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{said the}} Bee-man, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> myself. I like to carry something, and I have now neither my hive nor my doublet." ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{world is}} aware and {{by far the}} largest to me, and that is myself, [...] And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten {{thousand}} or ten [...] million years, [...] <b>I</b> <b>can</b> cheerfully <b>take</b> <b>it</b> now, or with equal cheerfulness <b>I</b> <b>can</b> wait.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good!' {{said the}} Mayor, smacking his dry lips. 'Now <b>I</b> suppose we <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> De Forest, that henceforward the Board will {{administer}} us direct?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> {{think you}} <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> that my job doesn't end there. I'm still a navy officer, though I'm now {{assisting}} the Trinity House." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He can't," [...] Gerald {{pointed out}} cunningly, using his strongest {{argument}} in {{an appeal to}} his father's prejudice. [...] "He will know nothing about the note if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> up when due." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your parson {{may be a}} good man," [...] {{returned}} the beetle, with some indignation, [...] "but he certainly is not overwise. Nevertheless, if you do not want the gold <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> from you as easily as I gave it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} all deeply," [...] said the Knight earnestly, [...] "but think it not ill of me if I cannot take it. Gladly have I {{borrowed}} it from you, {{but it may not}} be that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> as a gift." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes; <b>I</b> {{think we}} <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> that she’s a danger. I’ll tell my man {{to give you}} the truck you want and you had better get {{finished}} while the weather’s fine.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do it somehow," [...] Maxwell mused aloud. [...] "Now I {{have the}} right idea, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make <b>it</b> <b>take</b> any shape or color I want. It's magnificent!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can see that,' said Leonard. 'I do {{hope that}} if--if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> this patiently, <b>it</b> may show I am {{sorry for the}} real thing--and I may be forgiven. Oh! I am glad prisoners are not cut off from church.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{by taking}} it quick, {{you can get}} so much more into life. It takes you three hours {{and a half to}} hear and enjoy an opera. Suppose <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> in, and enjoy it, in half-an-hour. Why, I can enjoy seven operas, while you are listening; to one!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{there any}} answer, baas?" [...] asked Hans when I had thrust the note into my pocket. [...] "If so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> without being found out." [...] Then an {{inspiration}} seemed to strike him, and he added: [...] "Why {{do you not}} take it yourself? The Missie's window is easy to open, also I am sure she would be pleased to see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Morning Star, this evening, when I {{come back}} from school and am allowed to play with you, {{we can look at}} the {{wonderful}} beast in the tank, for look, I have the key which that fat priest will not search for till seven days are gone by, before which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> to him, saying that I found it in the sand, or perhaps put it back into his wallet." ...|$|E
6000|$|He nodded when Hayes told him. [...] "A fair estimate! <b>I</b> {{think we}} <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> as the proper price. You mean {{to buy the}} farms in, but I want them too, and if you force a sale, I'll bid higher." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> {{easy with}} that four {{thousand}} dollars missing?" [...] groaned the youth on the couch. [...] "Why, I can't make that amount up, and Mr. Sanderson can't {{afford to lose}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I speak no lie, O Shabaka, I {{before you}} am King of the Ethiopians. Moreover, I laid that kingship down {{of my own}} will and should <b>I</b> so desire, <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> up again when I will, since the Ethiopians are {{faithful}} to their kings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not take}} a buggy from the house," [...] she went on quickly, [...] "for I left early, {{and did not want}} to disturb them. In fact, they don't know that I am gone. I was worried at not hearing news from my father in San Francisco since the earthquake, and I thought I would run down to San Jose to inquire without putting them to any trouble. Anything will do that you have ready, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not often, madam, but sometimes. I {{can always}} find time for what I really want to do. If I like to be away {{for an hour or}} two, I'll sit up late the night before, long after midnight sometimes, {{planning}} the meals and the courses for the next day, and when I go away, I leave everything so that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> right up, the minute I get back, and lose nothing in time or in any other way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes? Well, of course, {{some people}} do. Prohibition and all that. Personally, it doesn't affect me. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> {{or leave it}} alone. I like America myself," [...] said Sam. [...] "I've had a {{wonderful}} time. Everybody's treated me like a rich uncle. I've been in Detroit, you know, and they practically gave me the city {{and asked me if}} I'd like another to take home in my pocket. Never saw anything like it. I might have been the missing heir! I think America's the greatest invention on record." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Lady Julia {{thinks that}} it's best as it is. You must go over, you know, {{and get the}} mother on your side, if you <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> the truth is this;--you mustn't be angry with me, you know, for saying it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis a noble gift, and indeed, I {{doubt whether}} the king himself has such horses in his stables. The {{question}} is, {{what is to}} be done with them? My present charger is an excellent one and, as a gift of the marshal, I could not part with it. As to the others, it is out of the question that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> both. <b>It</b> would be altogether contrary to rules. I am entitled to forage for two horses--that is, when forage is to be had.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I see," [...] said Deering. [...] "You do not {{yet know}} all Stannard's plans and now they're not important. <b>I</b> expect we <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> for granted that he {{imagined}} the demands could not long be met. Then he saw the police had found out his part in the shooting accident and he went down the rocks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What does it matter?" [...] {{he said at}} last, as he turned; [...] "'tis ten {{thousand}} to one against our meeting again; if we do, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> up where it breaks off now. She has acknowledged {{that she would have}} liked me if she had been sure that I was in earnest. Next time I shall be so. She was right. I was but amusing myself with her at first, and had no more thought of marrying her than I had of flying. But there, it is no use talking about the future; the thing now is {{to get out of this}} trap. I have felt like a rat in a cage with a terrier watching me for the last month, and long to be on horseback again, with the chance of making a fight for my life. What a fool Bathurst was to throw away the chance!" ...|$|E
6000|$|What shall I say {{in writing}} to you of Mr Whittlestaff? To [...] me {{personally}} he assumes the language of an enemy. But he [...] contrives {{to do so in}} such a way that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> only [...] as the expression of his regret that I should be found to [...] be standing in his way. His devotion to you is the most [...] beautiful expression of self-abnegation that I have ever [...] met. He tells me that nothing is done for me; but it is [...] only that I may understand how much more is done for you. [...] Next to me,--yes, Mary, next to myself, he should be the [...] dearest to you of human beings. I am jealous already, [...] almost jealous of his goodness. Would that I could look [...] forward to a life in which I would be regarded as his [...] friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "True, my lord; {{but it is}} {{also known}} to you that our craft, working in skins of cattle, stags, and every other {{description}} of hides, have a privilege, and are allowed to transact with those Highlanders, as with the men who can most readily supply us with the means of conducting our trade, to the great profit of the burgh. Thus it hath chanced with me to have great dealings with these men; and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> on my salvation, that you nowhere find more just and honourable traffickers, or by whom a man may more easily make an honest penny. I have made in my day several distant journeys into the far Highlands, upon the faith of their chiefs; nor did I ever meet with a people more true to their word, when you can once prevail upon them to plight it in your behalf. And as for the Highland chief, Gilchrist MacIan, saving that he is hasty in homicide and fire raising towards those with whom he hath deadly feud, I have nowhere seen a man who walketh a more just and upright path." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sympathy is just sympathy--that's all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> in Miss Verena and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> in all others--except the lady-correspondents," [...] {{the young}} man added, with a jocosity which, as he {{perceived}} even at the moment, was lost on Verena's friend. He was not more successful when he went on: [...] "It takes in even you, Miss Chancellor!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{was getting}} a little tired of this. [...] "But the glacier is there, sir," [...] I said, [...] "and I am taking out ice every day, and {{have reason to believe}} that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{continue}} to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> out {{for the rest of my}} life. With such facts as these before me, I am bound to say, sir, that I don't care in the least about reason." ...|$|R
60|$|JONES. [Who leans {{with his}} arms on the dock behind, speaks in a slow, sullen voice.] Wot I say is wot my wife says.
