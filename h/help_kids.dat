50|$|<b>Kids</b> <b>Helping</b> <b>Kids</b> {{was founded}} in 2002 {{by one of the}} San Marcos High School AP Economics classes. Its vision came from teacher Jamie Devries, who wanted to change the {{stagnant}} atmosphere of the AP Economics curriculum and give the students a real world application to the principles they learn in class. The organization’s first project was a penny drive, enlisting the help of local grade schools and high schools. From there, <b>Kids</b> <b>Helping</b> <b>Kids</b> students hosted a benefit night and silent auction at Santa Barbara’s Ruby’s Diner, where a portion of each dinner was donated to <b>Kids</b> <b>Helping</b> <b>Kids.</b> Through money raised from food sales, the silent auction, and donations, <b>Kids</b> <b>Helping</b> <b>Kids</b> was able to raise $8,000 for the 2003 year. This money was donated directly to the Santa Barbara Unity Shoppe, a public benefit corporation encouraging self-sufficiency and independence through education and basic necessities. Since then, <b>Kids</b> <b>Helping</b> <b>Kids</b> has grown exponentially; each year, the students have been building off of the accomplishments, both financial and organizational, of the prior class.|$|R
