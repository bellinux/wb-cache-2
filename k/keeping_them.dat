5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of whites against blacks. ADDSCO {{management}} had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, <b>keeping</b> <b>them</b> away for their safety.|$|E

5|$|According to a trade data study, painted turtles {{were the}} second most popular pet turtles after red-eared sliders in the early 1990s. As of 2010, most U.S. states allow, but discourage, painted turtle pets, {{although}} Oregon forbids <b>keeping</b> <b>them</b> as pets, and Indiana prohibits their sale. U.S. federal law prohibits sale or transport of any turtle less than , to limit human contact to salmonella. However, a loophole for scientific samples allows some small turtles to be sold, and illegal trafficking also occurs.|$|E
5|$|Ecologically, {{woodpeckers}} {{help to keep}} trees healthy by <b>keeping</b> <b>them</b> from suffering mass infestations. The {{family is}} noted {{for its ability to}} acquire wood-boring grubs from the trunks and branches, whether the timber is alive or dead. Having hammered a hole into the wood, the prey is extracted by use of a long, barbed tongue. Woodpeckers consume beetles that burrow into trees, removing as many as 85 percent of emerald ash borer larvae from individual ash trees.|$|E
5|$|Few zoos hold termites, {{due to the}} {{difficulty}} in <b>keeping</b> <b>them</b> captive and to the reluctance of authorities to permit potential pests. One of the few that do, the Zoo Basel in Switzerland, has two thriving Macrotermes bellicosus populations– resulting in an event very rare in captivity: the mass migrations of young flying termites. This happened in September 2008, when thousands of male termites left their mound each night, died, and covered the floors and water pits of the house holding their exhibit.|$|E

5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of <b>keeping</b> <b>them</b> moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water, {{but there are no}} true marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such {{was the case with the}} Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, the {{drainage}} boards {{have been charged}} with watching the rhynes and <b>keeping</b> <b>them</b> clear, under the overall responsibility of the Environment Agency. With rising sea levels, the work required to maintain the sea defences is likely to become more expensive, and it has been proposed that two inland seas be created. Other studies have recommended maintaining the current defences for five years while undertaking further studies of available options.|$|E
5|$|That day at Belmont Park $7.9 {{million was}} wagered on the nine races that were held during the day, which {{includes}} $2.2 million from off-track betting. A total of $5.6 million was bet through the mutuels that day. The Stakes itself had $519,689 bet on it. Bettors holding 5,617 winning parimutuel tickets on Secretariat never redeemed them, presumably <b>keeping</b> <b>them</b> as souvenirs {{and also because}} the $2 was worth $2.20.|$|E

5|$|The Everglades hosts 1,392 exotic {{plant species}} {{actively}} reproducing in the region, outnumbering the 1,301 species considered native to South Florida. The melaleuca tree (Melaleuca quinquenervia) takes water in greater amounts than other trees. Melaleucas grow taller and more densely in the Everglades than {{in their native}} Australia, making them unsuitable as nesting areas for birds with wide wingspans. They also choke out native vegetation. More than $2million has been spent on <b>keeping</b> <b>them</b> out of Everglades National Park.|$|E

Secretariat became the ninth Triple Crown winner in history, and the first since Citation in 1948, a gap of 25 years.

5|$|As Lennon hated doing {{a second}} take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's {{technical}} manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the {{signal from the}} sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity, but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby <b>keeping</b> <b>them</b> locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: {{the effect of the}} Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.|$|E
5|$|Attalea {{is a large}} genus of palms {{native to}} Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus {{includes}} both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers. Since the genera can only be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for <b>keeping</b> <b>them</b> all in the same genus. This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny.|$|E

5|$|Goldfish, {{domestication}} of: In ancient China, {{various species}} of carp (collectively known as Asian carps) were domesticated {{and have been}} reared as food fish for thousands of years. Some of these normally gray or silver species {{have a tendency to}} produce red, orange or yellow color mutations; this was first recorded in the Jin Dynasty (265–420). During the Tang Dynasty (618–907), it was popular to raise carp in ornamental ponds and watergardens. A natural genetic mutation produced gold (actually yellowish orange) rather than silver coloration. People began to breed the gold variety instead of the silver variety, <b>keeping</b> <b>them</b> in ponds or other bodies of water. Goldfish were introduced into Europe during the 17th century, and into North America in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} {{other areas of}} South Australia, and Australia as a whole, {{settlers}} on the frontier employed various tactics to deal with Aboriginal resistance to being forced off their traditional lands. Initially, these revolved around <b>keeping</b> <b>them</b> at a distance using threats of violence, but they soon escalated to terrorising Aboriginal people to stop them interfering with stock and other property, tactics which sometimes included violent clashes. Violence by settlers towards Aboriginal people often went unreported to the authorities, and became more secretive after a settler was hanged in March 1847 for murdering an Aboriginal man in the south east of the colony, the only such sentence {{in the history of}} South Australia's early white settlement. This frontier violence has been described as an undeclared and covert war between settlers and Aboriginal people.|$|E
5|$|In the Star Trek universe, {{prior to}} the arrival of Voyager in the Delta Quadrant, {{hostilities}} between the Trabe and the Kazon led to the Trabe <b>keeping</b> <b>them</b> subjugated. Violence between the Kazon was encouraged to limit the risk of them rising up against the Trabe. Before being conquered by the Trabe, the Kazon were the most advanced society in the quadrant. On stardate 2346, Jal Sankur united the sects into the Kazon Order or the Kazon Collective to overthrow the Trabe. The Kazon stole the Trabe's technology and ships and, rather than settle on a new homeworld, became a nomadic species. After achieving independence from the Trabe, the Kazon continued to fight among themselves for control of resources and technology.|$|E
