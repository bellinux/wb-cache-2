25|$|On July 10, 1969, a {{group of}} boys riding their Schwinn Sting-Ray {{bicycles}} in Palms Park in West Los Angeles wanted to race. A park attendant, Ronald Mackler, a teenager with motorcycle motocross (MX) experience, helped them organize. Palms Park became to BMX as Elysian Fields is to American baseball, for at that moment Bicycle Motocross racing was born. By 1973, entrance fees of US$4.50 (which included a US$1.00 <b>insurance</b> <b>fee</b> for the year) for a 10-week season of Thursday-night racing was charged, and the top three racers in the season were given trophies. Then a new season of 10 weeks would start the following Thursday.|$|E

There's really no need to try to take a picture of someone—in fact, how can you prove the person in front of the laptop was the one who stole it?... And to install this stuff on anyone's computer and not notify them about, it is just begging for a world of pain." [...] Robert Richardson, Director of the Computer Security Institute, said: [...] "It's incredible that they didn't realize they were playing with fire." [...] Technology journalist Robert X. Cringely wrote in InfoWorld: [...] Is there any reason why you'd need to take two weeks' worth of photos to locate a missing laptop, especially when you already have other ways of tracking it? I don't think so.... Cafiero issued … the rather interesting statement that the 15-year-old Robbins had [...] "no reasonable expectation of privacy" [...] in his own home, because … his family hadn't paid the $55 <b>insurance</b> <b>fee</b> required by the school for home loaners. [...] In other words: If you don't pay your dues, we can watch you while you sleep. Did I say [...] "creepy" [...] already? ...|$|E

40|$|Variable annuities, as a {{class of}} {{retirement}} income products, allow equity market exposure for a policyholder's retirement fund with electable additional guarantees to limit the downside risk of the market. Management <b>fees</b> and guarantee <b>insurance</b> <b>fees</b> are charged respectively for the market exposure and for the protection from the downside risk. We investigate the impact of management fees on the pricing of variable annuity guarantees under optimal withdrawal strategies. Two optimal strategies, from policyholder's and from insurer's perspectives, are respectively formulated and the corresponding pricing problems are solved using dynamic programming. Our results show that when management fees are present, the two strategies can deviate significantly from each other, leading to a substantial difference of the guarantee <b>insurance</b> <b>fees.</b> This provides a possible explanation of lower guarantee <b>insurance</b> <b>fees</b> observed in the market. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate our results...|$|R

50|$|The {{one to one}} {{computing}} initiative {{began in}} the 2013-2014 school year. Each student received a Lenovo netbook to use throughout the school year to improve their learning experience {{both in and out}} of the classroom. This initiative has continued, and has been expanded to Conestoga Valley Middle School. Students receive the laptops free of cost, paying only a $40 per year <b>insurance</b> <b>fee</b> to cover accidental damage or loss of technological equipment. The school hopes that this move towards technology will lower the overall cost throughout the school by eliminating printed textbooks and worksheets. This change has accompanied e-book readers for use in the library and iPads that are distributed throughout the building on a variety of carts available for both teacher and student usage.|$|E
50|$|In {{an economy}} with full {{currency}} substitution, monetary authorities cannot act as lender {{of last resort}} to commercial banks by printing money. The alternatives to lending to the bank system may include taxation and issuing government debt. The loss of the lender of last resort is considered a cost of full currency substitution. This cost depends on the initial level of unofficial currency substitution before moving to a full currency substituted economy. This relation is negative because in a heavily currency substituted economy, the central bank already fears difficulties in providing liquidity assurance to the banking system. However, literature points out the existence of alternative mechanisms to provide liquidity insurance to banks, such as a scheme by which the international financial community charges an <b>insurance</b> <b>fee</b> {{in exchange for a}} commitment to lend to a domestic bank.|$|E
5000|$|Approved in 2008 {{by state}} regulators, {{groundbreaking}} came in 2009. [...] The project design now includes 338 GE2.5XL turbines built by GE Wind Energy, {{each with a}} capacity to produce 2.5 megawatts, and used {{for the first time}} in USA. These turbines and a ten-year service contract cost a total of $1.4 billion, the largest expense on the estimated $2 billion project. [...] In December 2010, the Department of Energy (DOE) offered a $1.3 billion loan guarantee for the project. The <b>insurance</b> <b>fee</b> for the loan guarantee would be paid from federal stimulus money through the Financial Institution Partnership Program. [...] Generating capacity will be 845 megawatts, producing an estimated 2 billion kWh each year, enough to provide electricity to 235,000 homes. Once operational, the facility will have about 35 permanent employees. The wind farm is estimated to have an economic impact of $16 million annually for Oregon. In April 2011, Google announced they had invested $100 million in the project, part of a $500 million investment package announced by GE and including as investors, also, subsidiaries of Itochu Corp. and Sumitomo Corp.. The facility was officially opened on September 22, 2012.|$|E
