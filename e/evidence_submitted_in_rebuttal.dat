Brown began by {{explaining that the}} ingredient menthol contains compounds such as benzopyrene, which are carcinogenic when smoked. Second, he argued that mentholated cigarettes contain higher nicotine and tar levels than non-mentholated cigarettes. Thirdly, Brown claimed that menthol encourages deeper and longer inhalation of tobacco smoke, increasing the addictive properties of the cigarette and decreasing the lung's ability to rid itself of carcinogenic components of smoke. Based on <b>evidence</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>in</b> Brown, mentholated cigarettes account for between 60-75 percent of the cigarettes smoked by African Americans—and 90 percent of African American youth who smoke, smoke menthols.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{set out to}} {{evaluate}} <b>evidence</b> <b>submitted</b> by GPs for appraisal, and to explore how a model of appraisal can be developed which {{meets the needs of}} revalidation while remaining developmental and formative. This paper focuses on comparing <b>evidence</b> <b>submitted</b> by principal and sessional GPs, following previous work demonstrating problems facing the latter group. METHODS: A checklist devised by one author was used by appraisers in one PCT to record <b>evidence</b> <b>submitted</b> for appraisal. This enabled a comparison between 76 principal and 47 sessional GPs of <b>evidence</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>in</b> one appraisal year from April 2008 to March 2009. The evidence was classified as personal or practice based, and the presence of reflection was noted. This quantitative evidence was supplemented by qualitative data from five focus groups with 22 GPs and one appraisal manager, and by interviews with seven GP appraisal leads in PCTs. RESULTS: While some differences were noted between principal and sessional GPs, there were no differences found between the proportion of principal and sessional GPs who <b>submitted</b> personal <b>evidence</b> concerning data collection/audit, significant events, multi-source feedback and complaints. Focus groups indicated reasons and strategies which reflected these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Sessional GPs have already begun to use innovative approaches to ensure they meet the evidence requirements of appraisal and revalidation. However, {{they are more likely to}} succeed if they are well supported by educational and practice networks...|$|R
