In the current issue of the British Journal of Pharmacology, Weston et al. combine classic pharmacological approaches with electrophysiological and molecular techniques to suggest that attenuated endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (and as a consequence vasodilatation) reflects major disruption of pathways associated with the activation of endothelial small conductance Ca 2 +-activated K-channels (SKCa) in mesenteric arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats. In addition to reductions in SKCa and KIR proteins, changes in caveolin- 1 isomers were also detected, possibly indicating channel realignment within plasmalemmal structures...|$|E

Hyperpolarization (by intracellular glass microelectrode) and NO release (by NO-sensitive electrode) in response to acetylcholine and bradykinin, with and without incubation with NG-nitro-L-arginine, indomethacin, and oxyhemoglobin, were measured.

40|$|Hyperpolarization causing {{smooth muscle}} {{relaxation}} {{contributes to the}} maintenance of vascular homeostasis, particularly in small-calibre arteries and arterioles. It may also become a compensatory vasodilator mechanism upregulated in states with impaired nitric oxide (NO) availability. Bioassay of vascular hyperpolarization in the human circulation has been hampered by the complexity of mechanisms involved and the limited availability of investigational tools. Firm evidence, however, supports the notion that hyperpolarization participates in the regulation of resting vasodilator tone and vascular reactivity in healthy subjects. In addition, an enhanced endothelium-derived hyperpolarization contributes to both resting and agonist-stimulated vasodilation in a variety of cardiovascular risk conditions and disease. Thus, hyperpolarization mediated by epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and H 2 O 2 has been observed in coronary arterioles of patients with coronary artery disease. Similarly, ouabain-sensitive and EETs-mediated <b>hyperpolarization</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> observed to compensate for NO deficiency in patients with essential hypertension. Moreover, in non-hypertensive patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and in hypercholesterolaemia, KCa channel-mediated vasodilation appears to be activated. A novel paradigm establishes that perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is an additional regulator of vascular tone/function and endothelium is not the only agent in vascular hyperpolarization. Indeed, some PVAT-derived relaxing substances, such as adiponectin and angiotensin 1 - 7, may exert anticontractile and vasodilator actions by the opening of KCa channels in smooth muscle cells. Conversely, PVAT-derived factors impair coronary vasodilation via differential inhibition of some K(+) channels. In view of adipose tissue abnormalities occurring in human obesity, changes in PVAT-dependent hyperpolarization may be relevant for vascular dysfunction also in this condition...|$|E

Another theory is that alterations in brain metabolism regulate activity dependent slow modulation of ATP-gated potassium channel conductance which induces burst suppression. However, modulating inhibitory activity alone may not be sufficient for burst suppression, and modulation in excitatory synaptic efficiency, stemming from the depletion and subsequent recovery of interstitial calcium levels, could contribute to the induction of burst suppression.|$|R

The value of this liquid junction potential as well as the measured resting membrane potential varies as a function of the anions and cations substituted in the sea water. Both the liquid junction potential and the sucrose-gap-induced hyperpolarization can be eliminated by using a low mobility anion to replace most of the chloride in sea water while the normal cation content remains unchanged.

40|$|Endothelium-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are {{fatty acid}} {{epoxides}} that {{play an important}} role in the control of vascular tone in selected coronary, renal, carotid, cerebral and skeletal muscle arteries. Vasodilation due to endothelium-dependent smooth muscle <b>hyperpolarization</b> (EDH) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suggested to involve EETs as a transferable endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. However, this activity may also be due to EETs interacting with the components of other primary EDH-mediated vasodilator mechanisms. Indeed, the transfer of hyperpolarization initiated in the endothelium to the adjacent smooth muscle via gap junction connexins occurs separately or synergistically with the release of K+ ions at discrete myoendothelial microdomain signalling sites. The net effects of such activity are smooth muscle hyperpolarization, closure of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels, phospholipase C deactivation and vasodilation. The spatially localized and key components of the microdomain signalling complex are the inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptor-mediated endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + store, Ca 2 +-activated K+ (KCa), transient receptor potential (TRP) and inward-rectifying K+ channels, gap junctions and the smooth muscle Na+/K+-ATPase. Of these, TRP channels and connexins are key endothelial effector targets modulated by EETs. In an integrated manner, endogenous EETs enhance extracellular Ca 2 + influx (thereby amplifying and prolonging KCa-mediated endothelial hyperpolarization) and also facilitate the conduction of this hyperpolarization to spatially remote vessel regions. The contribution of EETs and the receptor and channel subtypes involved in EDH-related microdomain signalling, as a candidate for a universal EDH-mediated vasodilator mechanism, vary with vascular bed, species, development and disease and thus represent potentially selective targets for modulating specific artery function. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

The possibility that ingestion of probiotics prevents endothelial dysfunction in rats following {{common bile duct}} ligation (CBDL) was evaluated. METHODS: Rats received either control drinking water or the probiotic VSL# 3 solution (50 billion bacteria. kg body wt⁻¹. day⁻¹) for 7 weeks. After 3 weeks, rats underwent surgery with either resection of the common bile duct or sham surgery. The reactivity of mesenteric artery rings was assessed in organ chambers, expression of proteins by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis, oxidative stress using dihydroethidium, and plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine levels by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Both NO- and EDH-mediated relaxations to acetylcholine were reduced in the CBDL group compared to the sham group, and associated with a reduced expression of Cx 37, Cx 40, Cx 43, IKCa and SKCa and an increased expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). In aortic sections, increased expression of NADPH oxidase subunits, angiotensin converting enzyme, AT 1 receptors and angiotensin II, and formation of ROS and peroxynitrite were observed. VSL# 3 prevented the deleterious effect of CBDL on EDH-mediated relaxations, vascular expression of connexins, IKCa, SKCa and eNOS, oxidative stress, and the angiotensin system. VSL# 3 prevented the CBDL-induced increased plasma TNF-α, IL- 1 α and MCP- 1 levels.

The strength-duration time constant increases with demyelination, as the exposed membrane is enlarged by inclusion of paranodal and internodal membrane.

The voltage-sensitivities and rates of current activation, inactivation, deactivation, and recovery from inactivation were similar to those of expressed α 1 G (CaV 3. 1) Ca 2 + channel clones, except that the rate of deactivation was significantly faster. We reproduced the amplitude and kinetics of measured T currents with a numerical simulation based on a kinetic model developed for an α 1 G Ca 2 + channel.

In addition, AHPs in neurones can be divided into two distinct types that are easily separated by kinetic and pharmacological criteria.

However, rather than <b>hyperpolarization,</b> a depolarization <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reported to occur after treatment of B lymphocytes with anti-Ig. To determine if Ca 2 +-dependent K+ channels are present in B lymphocytes, and {{to examine the relationship between}} intracellular free calcium and membrane potential, we monitored [Ca 2 +]i by means of indo- 1 and transmembrane potential using bis(1, 3 -diethylthiobarbituric) trimethine oxonol in human tonsillar B cells activated by anti-IgM. Treatment with anti-IgM induced a biphasic increase in [Ca 2 +]i and a simultaneous hyperpolarization. A similar hyperpolarization was induced by ionomycin, a Ca 2 + ionophore. Delaying the development of the [Ca 2 +]i response by increasing the cytoplasmic Ca 2 +-buffering power delayed the hyperpolarization. Conversely, eliminating the sustained phase of the [Ca 2 +]i response by omission of external Ca 2 + abolished the prolonged hyperpolarization. In fact, a sizable Na+-dependent depolarization was unmasked. This study demonstrates that in human B lymphocytes, Ca 2 +-dependent K+ channels can be activated by crosslinking of surface IgM.

40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) yields remarkably detailed structural information about virtually any molecule. However, {{its application to}} non-equilibrium systems is hampered {{by a lack of}} sensitivity. To increase the amount of signal that can be obtained from a NMR experiment, various <b>hyperpolarization</b> schemes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> previously introduced. One such technique is dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which can enhance NMR sensitivity by several orders of magnitude. The work detailed here focuses on the development of methods utilizing DNP to study non-equilibrium systems such as chemical and biochemical reactions in real-time. To work with hyperpolarized samples, we have designed and constructed a rapid injection and mixing system. This system allows samples to be transported between superconducting magnets used for polarization and for NMR spectroscopy in less than two seconds. Rapid transport is essential for successful use of samples with short spin-lattice relaxation times. For the study of reactions under non-equilibrium conditions, the system provides the additional capability for samples to be mixed with a second, unpolarized reagent. A chromogenic trypsin catalyzed ester hydrolysis reaction was used to validate the DNP-NMR technique as a tool for kinetic analysis. It is shown that the DNP-NMR method agrees with the conventional UV method within the uncertainty of the measurement. Hyperpolarization in this modality presents both challenges and opportunities, each of which motivate the development of new NMR techniques. In addition to the determination of kinetics, DNP-NMR is amenable to mechanistic analysis of a reaction. We have developed a technique based on selective inversion of spin-polarization, which allows for mapping of atoms between reactant and product of a reaction. This scheme was applied to a Grignard reaction, demonstrating applicability to organic reactions. Signal averaging, as it is applied for conventional multi-dimensional correlation spectroscopy cannot always be applied easily when using hyperpolarized sample. For the rapid measurement of heteronuclear correlation spectra, we have developed a technique utilizing the differential scaling of scalar coupling under off-resonance irradiation. Although DNP-NMR yields spectra of outstanding quality even with small quantities of sample, peak intensities are not quantitative. It is nevertheless possible to compare peak multiplets obtained from fractionally isotope labeled samples. Using biosynthetically labeled lipids from E. Coli cells, we showed that the resulting labeling patterns reflect their biosynthetic pathways. As a final case-study employing several of these newly developed methods, the uronate isomerase catalyzed isomerization of glucuronate into fructuronate was studied. The ability to follow the reaction in real-time while directly observing all anomeric forms of the reactant and product permits the independent determination of kinetics for each anomeric form of substrate and product.

We aimed to assess the effect of sulfaphenazole, a specific CYP 2 C 9 inhibitor, on tPA release in normotensive subjects and patients with essential hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: tPA release was measured in the forearm microcirculation of 56 normotensivesubjects and 57 patients with essential hypertension after bradykinin (0. 015 microg x 100 mL(- 1) x min(- 1)) and acetylcholine (1. 5 microg x 100 mL(- 1) x min(- 1)) infusions, with or without sulfaphenazole (0. 03 microg x 100 mL(- 1) x min(- 1)). Bradykinin and acetylcholine infusions were repeated with N(G) -monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA; 100 microg x 100 mL(- 1) x min(- 1)) and/or sulfaphenazole. tPA release by bradykinin and acetylcholine was higher in normotensive subjects than in patients with essential hypertension (P< 0. 01). Sulfaphenazole (P< 0. 01) blunted bradykinin-induced but not acetylcholine-induced tPA release in both groups. In normotensive subjects, L-NMMA infusion reduced tPA release (P< 0. 01). When L-NMMA was coinfused with sulfaphenazole, tPA release induced by bradykinin, but not by acetylcholine, was further reduced (P< 0. 01). In patients with essential hypertension, tPA release by both agonists was unaffected by L-NMMA, but only bradykinin-induced tPA release was blunted by sulfaphenazole, alone or with L-NMMA (P< 001). CONCLUSIONS: Sulfaphenazole inhibits bradykinin-induced tPA release, which suggests a modulatory role of CYP 2 C 9 -derived endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors in tPA release in humans.

40|$|Despite {{its broad}} {{applicability}} NMR <b>has</b> always <b>been</b> limited by its inherently low sensitivity. <b>Hyperpolarization</b> methods <b>have</b> {{the potential to}} overcome this limitation and, {{in the case of}} ex situ dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), large enhancement factors <b>have</b> <b>been</b> achieved. Although many other polarization methods <b>have</b> <b>been</b> described in the past, including chemically and parahydrogen-induced polarization and optical pumping, DNP <b>has</b> recently <b>been</b> the most popular. Here we present an additional polarization mechanism arising from quantum rotor effects in methyl groups, which generates polarizations at temperatures <  1. 5  K and interferes with DNP at such temperatures. The polarization generated by this mechanism is efficiently transferred via carbon bound protons. Although quantum rotor polarizations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> studied for a small range of molecules in great detail, we observe such effects for a much broader range of substances with very different polarization rates at temperatures <  1. 5  K. Moreover, we report transfer of quantum rotor polarization across a chain of protons. The observed effect not only influences the polarization in low-temperature DNP experiments but also opens a new independent avenue to generate enhanced sensitivity for NMR...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{different}} voltage or calcium-dependent currents present in murine peritoneal macrophages, and in a macrophage-like cell line, J 774. Three of these are K currents while the fourth is carried by CI. One K current, activated by <b>hyperpolarization,</b> <b>has</b> all {{the characteristics of the}} inward rectifier found in egg or muscle cells. It appears in peritoneal macrophages only after several days in culture. A second K current, activated by depolarization, is a typical delayed rectifier. The amplitude of these currents and, as a consequence, the membrane potential of the cells, can be markedly changed by the movement of fluid around the cells. A third K current is activated by internal calcium levels in the micromolar range. It presents a low-voltage sensitivity and is blocked by 0. 1 - 1 mM quinine. The CI current flows through large-size channels (180 - 390 pS) that are active mainly in excised patches. These channels are unlikely to be half gap junctional channels, as suggested in former studies. The second goal {{of this paper is to}} examine if the activation of receptors for the Fc fragment of IgGs (Fc receptors) is associated with a change in the electrical properties of the membrane of macrophages. We have observed that the binding of multivalent ligands (the monoclonal antibody 2. 4 G 2, aggregated IgGs, or sheep red blood cells coated with IgGs) to their Fc receptors on adherent macrophages did not trigger any change in resting potential. This is a surprising difference with former results obtained o...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} salient {{features}} to emerge in visual cortex is sensitivity to stimulus orientation. Here we asked if orientation selectivity, once established, is altered by successive stages of cortical processing. We measured patterns of orientation selectivity at all depths of the cat's visual cortex by making whole-cell recordings with dye-filled electrodes. Our {{results show that the}} synaptic representation of orientation indeed changes with position in the microcircuit, as information passes from layer 4 to layer 2 + 3 to layer 5. At the earliest cortical stage, for simple cells in layer 4, orientation tuning curves for excitation (depolarization) and inhibition (<b>hyperpolarization)</b> <b>had</b> similar peaks (within 0 – 7 deg, n = 11) and bandwidths. Further, the sharpness of orientation selectivity covaried with receptive field geometry (r = 0. 74) - the more elongated the strongest subregion, the shaper the tuning. Tuning curves for complex cells in layer 2 + 3 also had similar peaks (within 0 – 4 deg, n = 7) and bandwidths. By contrast, at a later station, layer 5, the preferred orientation for excitation and inhibition diverged such that the peaks of the tuning curves could be as far as 90 deg apart (average separation, 54 deg; n = 6). Our results support the growing consensus that orientation selectivity is generated at the earliest cortical level and structured similarly for excitation and inhibition. Moreover, our novel finding that the relative tuning of excitation and inhibition changes with laminar position helps resolve prior controversy about orientation selectivity at later phases of processing and gives a mechanistic view of how the cortical circuitry recodes orientation...|$|R
30|$|Recordings of {{the current}} flowing through single {{channels}} indicate that channels fluctuate rapidly between open and closed states in a stochastic fashion. Nevertheless, most models of a neuron use deterministic descriptions of conductance changes, {{under the assumption that}} there are a large number of approximately independent channels of each type. It then follows from the law of large numbers that the fraction of channels open at any given time is approximately equal to the probability that any one channel is in an open state. The conductance g_s for ion channels of type s is thus taken to be the product g_s=g̅_s P_s where g̅_s is equal to the density of channels in the membrane multiplied by the conductance of a single channel, and P_s is the fraction of open channels. The voltage-dependence of the probabilities P_s {{in the case of a}} delayed-rectifier K+ current and a fast Na+ current were originally obtained by Hodgkin and Huxley [76] as part of their Nobel prize winning work on the generation of action potentials in the squid giant axon. The delayed-rectifier K+ current is responsible for terminating an action potential by repolarizing a neuron. We find that opening of the K+ channel requires structural changes in four identical and independent subunits so that P_K = n^ 4 where n is the probability that any one gate subunit has opened. In the case of the fast Na+ current, which is responsible for the rapid depolarization of a cell leading to action potential generation, the probability of an open channel takes the form P_Na=m^ 3 h where m^ 3 is the probability that an activating gate is open and h is the probability that an inactivating gate is open. Depolarization causes m to increase and h to decrease, whereas <b>hyperpolarization</b> <b>has</b> the opposite effect.|$|R
40|$|Techniques for the {{enhancement}} of the nuclear spin polarization (<b>hyperpolarization)</b> <b>have</b> demonstrated ~ 10 5 fold amplification of 13 C NMR signal: new applications like imaging of metabolic processes in real-time and in vivo are in reach. PASADENA is a unique technique reaching high nuclear polarization (P) within seconds in liquid state: spin order of parahydrogen is transferred to a third nucleus by an r. f. spin-order-transfer (SOT) sequence. In this work, a semi-automated PASADENA polarizer for hyperpolarization of biomolecules in aqueous solution was constructed: P ~ 0. 1 on 13 C was demonstrated (a ~ 10 5 fold 13 C signal enhancement at B 0 = 1 T and T = 293 K). A simulation of the spin dynamics of the PASADENA experiment was developed to calculate the parameters for the SOT sequence and to predict the hyperpolarization yield. New compounds were introduced: the metabolic tracer 1 - 13 C, 2, 3 -D 2 succinate (Suc) and the functional agent 2, 2, 3, 3 -D 4 tetraflouropropyl 1 - 13 C, 2, 3, 3 -D 3 propionate (TFPP) were hyperpolarized (P ~ 0. 1). The stability of the hyperpolarization was investigated in experiment and simulations. The lifetimes of the 13 C hyperpolarization of Suc, TFPP and 2, 2, 3, 3 -hydroxyethyl 1 - 13 C 2, 3, 3 -D 3 propionate (HEP) were determined in dependence of molecular deuteration, solvent deuteration, pH and B 0 : the maximal T 1 = (59. 7 ± 3. 2) s of Suc prolongs the window for in vivo detection significantly. Strong enhancement of 13 C NMR signal was observed in vivo after injection of hyperpolarized Suc and HEP in animals and cell cultures, demonstrating the potential biologically relevant molecules hyperpolarized by PASADENA in biomedical research...|$|R

40|$|Membrane {{currents}} and extracellular [K+] were measured in canine Purkinje strands during voltage-clamp steps to plateau or diastolic potentials. Extracellular [K+] increased during step depolarizations and decreased during step hyperpolarizations. On hyperpolarization, the largest {{fraction of the}} K+ depletion occurred during the initial 500 ms of the voltage-clamp step and was correlated with a potassium depletion current, the id. A slower component of the depletion also occurred on <b>hyperpolarization</b> and <b>had</b> a time constant consistent with cylindrical diffusion of potassium within the Purkinje strands. On depolarization, there is an accumulation of K+ that is correlated with the plateau current ix. On termination of depolarizing test pulses, the K+ accumulation decays with a time course similar to the ix tail current. Surprisingly, no accumulation of K+ occurred during the arrhythmogenic transient inward current, TI, suggesting that the selectivity of this current should be reevaluated...|$|R

40|$|The {{crayfish}} Sustaining fibers (SFs) {{are used}} to analyze the functional organization of the second optic lobe, the Medulla. The SFs are tonic ON visual interneurons whose dendrites lie in a single plane in the Medullary neuropile, and whose axons project via the optic tract to the supraesophageal ganglion, or brain. The SF passive properties are remarkable linear. In the region of the primary neurite generally recorded from, these neurons show linear i-V, i-f and V-f functions. The SF dendrites appear to be entirely passive integrators of their synaptic inputs. The light-driven synaptic input to SFs is delivered by a retinotopic columnar array. The EPSP in response to a light stimulus is large (20 - 40 mV), and consists of two phases. The transient phase has a reversal potential approximately 50 mV above resting potential. The steady-state phase has a reversal potential about 37 mV above rest, and is associated with a steady-state input conductance which has a peak of about 120 % of the resting value. A light-OFF <b>hyperpolarization</b> <b>has</b> a reversal potential 5 mV below rest and is associated with a conductance increase. Cable modelling of SFs revealed that the dendrites are electrotonically compact, about 0. 5 (lamda) in total width. Passive voltage attenuations in the dendrites are very small (average 6 % proximal to distal, 35 % distal to proximal). The synaptic parameters (reversal potential and conductance change) are used in conjunction with the model to accurately predict the EPSP voltage. A class of local, non-spiking amacrine (axon-less) cells is described. They are morphologically similar to the SF dendritic trees but with two distinct planes of dendrites and no axons. These neurons respond to light with a response like the SF EPSP but produce no action potentials. The amacrine cells strongly inhibit SF excitatory inputs without directly synapsing on the SFs. Similarities between amacrine cell properties and SF surround inhibition lead {{to the conclusion that the}} amacrine cells are directly involved in the formation of SF surround inhibition, and act on the columnar input pathway of the SFs...|$|R
