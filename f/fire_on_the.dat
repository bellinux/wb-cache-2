5|$|At a dock {{owned by}} Shell Oil Company in Deer Park near Houston, a {{lightning}} bolt from thunderstorms of Elena struck the oil supertanker SS Chevron Hawaii. The lightning started a <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship, which expanded and wrecked one adjacent barge and burned nearby docks. The ship was nearly split in half from the lightning strike, and oil seeped into Houston Ship Channel for several hours. Firefighters combated the <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tanker in boats, but their efforts were hindered due to unsettled weather from Elena, as well as unsafe water to travel through. The fire caused three deaths and 13 injuries, and damage related to the incident totaled $27 million (1979 USD, $76 million 2007 USD).|$|E
5|$|Broad Channel {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1880 as a Long Island Railroad station. The LIRR discontinued service in 1950 after a <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trestle across Jamaica Bay, to the station's north. The station reopened June 28, 1956, as a subway station.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, Washington {{moved the}} army closer to Yorktown and British gunners opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> infantry. Throughout the day several British cannon fired on the Americans {{but there were}} few casualties. Fire was also {{exchanged}} between American riflemen and Hessian Jägers.|$|E

5|$|After the {{generally}} failed assaults on the bridges, the German divisions began crossing attempts over the rivers IJssel and Maas. The first waves typically were destroyed, due to insufficient preparatory <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillboxes. At most places a secondary bombardment destroyed the pillboxes and the infantry divisions crossed the river after building pontoon bridges; but at some, as Venlo, the attempt was aborted. At Arnhem, Leibstandarte Der Fuehrer led the assault and that day {{advanced to the}} Grebbe Line, followed by 207. Infanteriedivision.|$|E
5|$|All male Upper Canadians between 18 and 60years of {{age were}} members of the Sedentary Militia, which was called into active duty during the Rebellions of 1837. Macdonald served as a private in the militia, patrolling the area around Kingston, but the town saw no real action and Macdonald was not called upon to <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> enemy.|$|E

5|$|At least 70 {{people were}} wounded when {{hundreds}} of residents attacked {{the police station}} in Khargah to demand the ouster of a police official who {{had a reputation for}} heavy-handedness. Police then opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> protesters. Authorities said that 11 people had been killed. The United Nations estimated deaths at more than 300.|$|E
5|$|At the Pfullendorf heights, {{the fight}} began anew. Charles sent two strong columns of eight battalions each across the Ostrach stream. The French poured <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Austrians, who took heavy losses, {{but did not}} give up the ground. In the night, Fürstenberg broke through the French line to Einhard, {{flanking}} Jourdan's main force and cutting off Saint Cyr. Further south, Wallis threatened {{to do the same}} to Fontaine and Ferino. As darkness fell, so ended the first day of fighting.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were then}} made to {{establish}} batteries {{to the west}} and north of the city, but these efforts were hampered by heavy rain, delaying the construction of defensive earthworks which allowed the garrison to maintain a constant <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> work parties, which suffered consequent casualties. Fire was especially heavy against the siege lines {{to the north of the}} city, which were easily targeted by the French gunners on 12 August. Operations to establish batteries on this front continued for several days even as losses mounted; on 15 August, Lieutenant Colonel George Maule, Braithwaite's chief engineer, was killed by cannon fire while returning from a night inspection of the trenches. On the night of 21 August the main battery, known as the Royal Battery, came under heavy shellfire and was damaged, but repairs were successful and on the morning of 22 August its 24-pounder long guns opened return <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E

5|$|Between 17:48 and 17:52, 11 German dreadnoughts, {{including}} Rheinland, {{engaged and}} opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though {{the range and}} poor visibility prevented effective fire, which was soon checked. Some ten minutes later Rheinland again opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> British cruisers, targeting what was most likely , though without success. By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the deployed Grand Fleet {{for a second time}} and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed, with Rheinland third from the front, behind Westfalen and Nassau. At 21:22, crewmen aboard Rheinland and Westfalen, the two leading ships in the German line, spotted two torpedo tracks {{that turned out to be}} imaginary. The ships were then forced to slow down in order to allow the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group to pass ahead. Around 22:00, Rheinland and Westfalen observed unidentified light forces in the gathering darkness. After flashing a challenge via searchlight that was ignored, the two ships turned away to starboard in order to evade any torpedoes that might have been fired. The rest of I Battle Squadron followed them.|$|E
5|$|By dawn, the Japanese attack had subsided. Over 750Japanese {{dead were}} counted {{in and around}} the American positions. No prisoners were taken. American {{casualties}} were 61dead, and 244wounded, including nine dead and 38wounded Seabees. The 2ndSquadron, 5thCavalry and the 40th Naval Construction Battalion received Presidential Unit Citations. General Chase called for an airdrop of ammunition, prodigious quantities of which had been expended during the night, and had Warramunga <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> native skidway.|$|E
5|$|During a {{memorial}} mass on 12 November 1991 for a pro-independence youth shot by Indonesian troops, demonstrators among the 2,500-strong crowd unfurled the Fretlin flag and banners with pro-independence slogans, and chanted boisterously but peacefully. Following a brief confrontation between Indonesian troops and protesters, 200 Indonesian soldiers opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crowd {{killing at least}} 250 Timorese.|$|E

5|$|Following the explosion, the {{remaining}} gunmen opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dazed band members, who {{had all been}} knocked down into the field {{below the level of}} the road from the force of the blast. The order to shoot was given by the patrol's apparent leader, James McDowell, to eliminate witnesses to the bogus checkpoint and subsequent bombing. Three of the musicians were killed: lead singer Fran O'Toole, trumpeter Brian McCoy, and guitarist Tony Geraghty.|$|E
5|$|Grayburn did not <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{occasional}} German traffic {{still using}} the bridge, preferring not to advertise the Allied presence until {{the rest of}} the battalion had arrived. Upon his arrival, Frost began securing more buildings around the ramp, and a small section attack was made on the bridge. The German defenders quickly repulsed this however and Tatham-Warter organised a stronger attack, to be led by Grayburn.|$|E
5|$|In October 1990, while {{flying a}} {{training}} route in eastern Colorado, B-1B (s/n 86-0128) from the 384th Bomb Wing, 28th Bomb Squadron, McConnell AFB, experienced an explosion as the engines reached full power without afterburners. <b>Fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's left was spotted. The #1 engine {{was shut down}} and its fire extinguisher was activated. The accident investigation determined that the engine had suffered catastrophic failure, engine blades had cut through the engine mounts and the engine became detached from the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Lariboisière's {{direction}} of artillery {{fire at the}} Battle of Austerlitz resulted {{in the destruction of}} the ice covering the lake over which Russian army forces retreated. His placement of artillery at the Battle of Borodino gave the French a tactical advantage in <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Russian lines. Lariboisière's artillery also provided the rear guard coverage of the French withdrawal from Beresina. One of his sons survived the wars and the family founded the Lariboisière Hospital in Paris.|$|E
5|$|No. 4 Commando {{made the}} {{crossing}} to Dieppe on board HMS Prins Albert. The crossing was uneventful and at 04:50 just before daybreak Group one landed unopposed. Using two Bangalore torpedos to blow {{a hole in}} the barbed wire, they managed to scale the cliffs. As they approached the battery at 05:45 it opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main landing force coming ashore at Dieppe. This was 30 minutes before Group one was expected {{to be in a position}} but Mills-Roberts responded by speeding up the advance to get their guns into action sooner. Once in position they opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battery with their mortars, Bren machine guns and sniper rifles. One of the mortar bombs landed inside the battery and exploded the stored charges, putting the guns out of action.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, however, one of {{the neon}} lights in the flame {{structure}} short-circuited and started a <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> yellow cotton sack placed over the bugler statue, causing an actual <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Christmas Candle flame for a brief amount of time. The blaze caused only minor damage to the Christmas Candle, but the bugler statue was exposed and visible inside the flame {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite this setback, the Christmas Candle was widely considered a success, and the Easton Area Christmas Committee signed a charter on December 17, 1951, tasking itself with organizing a yearly holiday program revolving around the Christmas Candle. The candle was assembled again every Christmas season until 1961, with ceremonies generally including holiday decorations, Christmas carols, refreshments, appearances by Santa Claus and other forms of entertainment. The Easton Area Christmas Committee was responsible for raising the funds and encouraging the civic interest necessary to keep the program active.|$|E
