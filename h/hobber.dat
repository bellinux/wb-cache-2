50|$|The bat and {{squirrel}} finally {{arrive at}} Greenreach, but Vesper is wounded by <b>Hobber</b> crows who have pursued them. Morwenna approaches Ysabelle, and tells {{her that she}} wants to help her bring the silver acorn to the Starglass. The unknowing squirrel maiden follows her down below the Hallowed Oak, into a dark chamber. As the two talk, Ysabelle begins to piece everything together and figures out that Morwenna is the one who betrayed the Greenreach squirrels. Morwenna confirms this and reveals that she is the priestess of Mabb, the rat goddess consort of Hobb. She takes the acorn from Ysabelle and locks her in the chamber where her pet toads wait to devour the squirrel maiden.|$|E
40|$|Machine tool {{vibration}} has {{and will}} {{be an issue in}} industry as long as shaping by means of physical material removal continues to be used. Developing a machine that can accommodate this natural vibration that occurs in the cutting process is a goal for every new machine design at the Gleason Works, Rochester. Knowing the vibration signature of a machine is very helpful in determining critical and non-critical cutter excitation frequencies. An analytical frequency analysis of simplified virtual models was completed to aid in the design process of the new Gleason GP 130 <b>Hobber.</b> To determine the accuracy of these results, a production GP 130 <b>hobber</b> hob column and hob head area was analyzed statically. Experimental mode shapes of the structure were extracted in a frequency range from 0 - 150 Hz and compared with analytical predictions. Correlation between the experimental and analytical sets of results is presented using the Modal Assurance Criterion. The frequency data found for the GP 130 machine is used in determining whether various hob cutter tooling selections fall in a critical excitation range of the machine...|$|E
30|$|SAD {{method is}} quite popular in machine tool {{design for the}} past decades due to its {{convenience}} and practicability. Donaldson [5] in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) firstly systematically used the static error allocation in developing the world-famous UPM (LODTM). The PV error was estimated for considering totally 11 error sources induced errors, and then the budgeted workpiece roughness was obtained. Dorndorf et al. [6] studied the optimal allocation of static machine error around the minimum cost, in which considering the probability characteristics of the errors. Brecher et al. [7] used the error allocation in the compact design of machine tools for providing the possibility to avoid, separate and compensate the machine errors. Uriarte et al. [8] made the overall error allocation for a micro-milling machine, mainly considering the collet angular deformation and tool deflection. Erkorkmaz et al. [9] carried out the error budget for the X–Y stage of precision machine tool, where the geometrical error, dynamic error, servo error and thermal error were mainly regarded. Cheng et al. [10] employed the error allocation for the optimum selection of key motion components and its position accuracy allocation when designing a desktop multi-axis laser machine for micro tool fabrications. Lin and Ehmann [11] discussed the tolerance distribution among the links and joints of a multi-axis machine. The allowable error tolerance limits of the link parameters and of the error motion of the joints were obtained through the maximum allowable tolerances definition for the position and orientation of the tool in the workspace. Huang and Zhang [12] studied the accuracy design of a gear <b>hobber</b> with complex forming motion based on the error prediction. Kang and Fan [13] studied the manufacturing accuracy allocation and optimization method of a CNC machine tool. The geometric error model was built by multi-body system theory, where the errors of angular displacement and perpendicularity were represented by the linear displacement errors. Yu et al. [14] conducted the accuracy distribution for a large CNC gantry guideway grinder based on the reliability theory, in which the reliability model is approximately established by response surface method with error samples from 25 sets of position of the grinder working stroke. Ding et al. [15] used similar method as above to study the accuracy design of the multi-axis machine tool oriented to remanufacturing. However, in the accuracy design process of the UPM, the linear errors and angular errors should be independently treated for its higher accuracy target than common machine tools. For solving this problem, and also for lessening the dependence on the engineering experience and improving the methodological portability, a new static accuracy design method of UPM based on global optimization and error sensitivity analysis was presented by Chen et al. [16]. In this method, the problem of static error allocation of the machine tool was transformed to that of multi-objective optimization with nonlinear constraints. The objective functions simultaneously consider the optimization of cost, balance and robustness. And, the sensitivity analysis {{was used in the}} stages of optimization and post-optimization respectively. Certainly, many studies about SAD method in the field of parallel mechanism and machine tool are also available, such as Song et al. [17] and Ni et al. [18], in which the common steps of error modeling, sensitivity analysis and optimization are also included.|$|E
50|$|Later that night, {{the group}} is {{attacked}} and Ysabelle, Vesper, {{and many of the}} squirrel guards are taken prisoner by <b>Hobbers,</b> a group of creatures who worship three evil rat gods called the Raith Sidhe, in particular the worst one, Hobb.|$|R
50|$|However, Fenny soon {{receives}} {{a message from}} a mysterious figure called The Ancient, who wishes to speak with Ysabelle and Vesper. Finally convinced {{that they are not}} <b>Hobbers,</b> Fenny leads them both down a dark passageway deep underground, where they come upon The Ancient—who is the messenger of the moon goddess, who came to earth {{in the form of a}} hare. He tells the bat and squirrel that the only way to prevent doom befalling the world is to convince their kinds to join together to battle the <b>Hobbers.</b> To Vesper's shock, The Ancient reveals that it was not the Starwife who took away the bats' power to see into the future, but their very own Warden of the Great Book, Hrethel.|$|R
50|$|It is soon {{realised}} that Ysabelle's silver acorn is {{gone from}} around her neck; {{it has been}} stolen by the high priest of Hobb. The squirrels and bat are led out to an area in the forest wherein {{a large amount of}} <b>Hobbers</b> are gathered. The high priest, dressed in a red silk costume, appears and calls for a squirrel to be taken to him. A wicked hedgehog named Pigwiggen unties the unfortunate squirrel, who is then led to the high priest. He is skinned alive in a sacrifice to Hobb. The high priest then lifts up the silver acorn and dips it in the squirrel's blood. Two more squirrels suffer this same fate before a group of Ysabelle's guards decide to recover the silver acorn while the <b>Hobbers</b> are distracted by the sacrificing.|$|R
50|$|Ysabelle and Vesper escape {{through a}} tunnel, though not before Wendel reveals his treachery. Mad with grief for his friend, Giraldus starts choking the stoat, but Wendel manages to free himself and {{strangle}} him. But before he dies, the mole starts a cave-in and Ysabelle and Vesper can only {{watch as the}} entire tunnel collapses on Giraldus, Wendel, and the <b>Hobbers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Hobbing machines, {{also known}} as <b>hobbers,</b> are fully {{automated}} machines that come in many sizes, because {{they need to be}} able to produce anything from tiny instrument gears up to [...] diameter marine gears. Each gear hobbing machine typically consists of a chuck and tailstock, to hold the workpiece or a spindle, a spindle on which the hob is mounted, and a drive motor.|$|R
2500|$|Hobbing {{machines}} are characterised by the largest module or pitch diameter it can generate. For example, a [...] capacity machine can generate gears with a 10 in pitch diameter and usually {{a maximum of}} a 10 in face width. Most hobbing {{machines are}} vertical <b>hobbers,</b> which means the blank is mounted vertically. Horizontal hobbing machines are usually used for cutting longer workpieces; i.e. cutting splines {{on the end of}} a shaft.|$|R
50|$|Before {{he can run}} to tell Giraldus what he has discovered, Wendel appears and taunts {{the little}} shrew. Then {{he pulls out a}} peeling knife and kills him. Tysle's body is found soon after, much to everyone's shock. His being peeled is {{confirmation}} that a member of the Hobb cult is among their number. Before this fact can completely sink in, a guard rushes to tell Fenny that the <b>Hobbers</b> are on the move, heading toward their stronghold.|$|R
50|$|At that moment, the <b>Hobbers</b> arrive, surging up {{the hill}} towards them. Now the bats and {{squirrels}} are allied together, fighting their true enemy. Ysabelle races up the Hallowed Oak to face Morwenna, who still has the silver acorn. But as she approaches her, the amulet around Morwenna's neck becomes extremely hot, burning her fur. It is then that Ysabelle realises that Hobb has begun {{to break through the}} ground. Ysabelle stares in horror while Morwenna is jubilant—that is, until she sees the claws of the rat god reaching for her. The high priest merely cursed the wearer of the silver acorn, not Ysabelle in particular. Hobb blows fire onto Morwenna and she is killed.|$|R
50|$|Later in the night, {{the ghosts}} of animals who had drowned in the lake rise up and try to drag the {{travellers}} down with them. The group manages to escape, and soon they {{find their way to}} a meadow filled with daffodils. It is here that they are captured by the very woodlanders they were searching for. These woodlanders are led by a mouse captain named Fenlyn Purfote. At first he acts friendly toward the five travellers, taking them to the woodlanders' headquarters, but his mood changes when he suddenly locks them up because he thinks they are <b>Hobbers.</b> Although they try to tell him that they most certainly are not, Fenlyn (or Fenny, as he is often called) will hear none of it.|$|R
