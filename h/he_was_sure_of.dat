5|$|On 8 September 1994 the DoD {{announced}} the actions {{it would take}} {{in response to the}} investigation's findings. May was charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide by military legal authorities. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson were charged with dereliction of duty. All of those charged faced an Article 32 hearing in which it would be decided if they should be tried by court-martial or the matter disposed of otherwise. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson faced a joint Article 32 hearing while May's hearing was separate. Wickson was not charged. Although not explicitly stated by USAF leaders, it appears that Wickson was not charged but May was because Wickson had testified that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> his identification of the two Black Hawks as hostile Hinds, while May had stated that he was not sure of Wickson's identification but had allowed the engagement to proceed anyway.|$|E
25|$|Due to his {{reputation}} for bravery, Modu began to gather a group of extremely loyal warriors. To be sure of their loyalty, Modu ordered each of the warriors to shoot his favourite horse. Those who refused were executed. He later repeated this test of loyalty, but {{with one of his}} favourite wives, and once again executed those who hesitated to obey his order. After <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> the loyalty of his remaining warriors, he ordered them to shoot at his father, killing him in a shower of arrows. With none of his followers failing to shoot at his command and the elimination of his father, Modu proclaimed himself Chanyu of the Xiongnu.|$|E
25|$|The President {{resolved}} to dismiss Cameron when abolitionists in the North settled over the controversy. Cameron would not resign until <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> his successor, {{and that he}} could leave the cabinet without damaging his reputation. When a vacancy in the post of Minister to Russia presented itself, Cameron and Lincoln agreed that he would fill the post when he resigned. As for a successor, Lincoln thought Joseph Holt best for the job, but his Secretary of State, William H. Seward, wanted Stanton to succeed Cameron. Salmon Chase, Stanton's friend and Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, agreed. Stanton had been preparing for a partnership with Samuel L. M. Barlow in New York, but abandoned these plans when he heard of his possible nomination. Lincoln nominated Stanton to the post of Secretary of War on January 13. He was confirmed two days following.|$|E

25|$|The Knossos archive was dated by Arthur Evans to the {{destruction}} by conflagration of about 1400 BC, which would have baked and preserved the clay tablets. He dated this event to the LM II period. This view stood until Carl Blegen excavated the site of ancient Pylos in 1939 and uncovered tablets inscribed in Linear B. They were fired in the conflagration that destroyed Pylos about 1200 BC, {{at the end of}} LHIIIB. With the decipherment of Linear B by Michael Ventris in 1952, serious questions about Evans' date began to be considered. Most notably, Blegen said that the inscribed stirrup jars, which are oil flasks with stirrup-shaped handles, imported from Crete around 1200 were of the same type as those dated by Evans to {{the destruction}} of 1400. Blegen found a number of similarities between 1200 BC Pylos and 1400 BC Knossos and suggested the Knossian evidence be reexamined, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> the 1200 Pylian date.|$|E
500|$|The Ottomans {{marched through}} Mat and pillaged the area. Skanderbeg took {{parallel}} routes through the mountains. Since {{he had not}} yet engaged Skanderbeg, Isak bey decided not to besiege Krujë, Albania's main fortress, until <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> the Albanian's fate. He thus camped with his men in the area north of Mount Tumenishta (Skënderbeu) to wait for Skanderbeg's appearance. This region was called Albulena (...) , located south of modern-day Laç. It was surrounded by a series of protective hills where guards were placed. Since Tumenishta had served as the main base for Skanderbeg's forays into the Ottoman camp at the Siege of Krujë (1450), Isak bey and Hamza prepared to annihilate any resistance they would find there. This effort came in vain, however, as they were not challenged by any Albanian forces. Still unsure of Skanderbeg's dispositions, the Ottoman commanders strengthened the camp's northern defenses, while the eastern side, in the direction of Tumenishta, remained lightly defended. Ottoman scouts crossed the Mat River into northern Albania. They were seen at the gates of Venetian-held Alessio (Lezhë) and ventured deeper into Venetian territory.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{released}} {{more than}} eight remixes of the song in different formats. At the time, [...] "Secret" [...] was experiencing success on the US record charts, to keep the song current in dance clubs, Madonna requested remixes of the song from Junior Vasquez, who was a DJ at the Sound Factory nightclub in New York. According to him Madonna's representatives [...] "sent me a cassette of the song, just {{to get an idea}} what the song was... nd when it was 100 beats per minute I said, 'Oh god, what am I gonna do with this?'" [...] Vasquez and his team of engineers first experimented with the track by making remixes closer to the original version. Then he used only Madonna's vocals for the mixed versions, and re-wrote and composed the music as brand new. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> doing house mixes of the track but had to [...] "speed-up" [...] Madonna's vocals. Recording engineer Dennis Mitchell explained, [...] "To do that we have to digitally manipulate her vocals, which is time compression... It just digitally goes in and snipes out tiny little digital slices of the actual sound and squeezes it together so that her tempo is a new tempo but her pitch stays the same." [...] According to Vasquez, Madonna was [...] "on top of everything" [...] including the house mixes {{as well as the other}} mixes created.|$|E

[...] "It is the last thing a man ought to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of." [...] The candle, half-consumed and burning dimly with a long wick, lighted up from below his inclined face, whose expression affected by the drawn-in cicatrices in the cheeks, had something vaguely unnatural, an exaggerated remorseful bitterness. As he sat there he had the air of meditating upon sinister things. The engineer-in-chief gazed at him for a time before he protested.|$|R
5000|$|Patrick Wormald observes: [...] "The thought occurs {{that neither}} Alfred nor Edward was greatly beloved at Winchester Cathedral; and {{one reason for}} Edward's moving his father's body into the new family shrine next door <b>was</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surer</b> <b>of</b> sincere prayers there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, doctor," [...] {{answered}} the priest, smiling quite pleasantly, [...] "there is one {{very good reason}} why a man of my trade should keep things to himself when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> them, {{and that is that}} it is so constantly his duty to keep them to himself when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> them. But if you think I have been discourteously reticent with you or anyone, I will go to the extreme limit of my custom. I will give you two very large hints." ...|$|R
