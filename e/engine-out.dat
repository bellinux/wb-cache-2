5|$|The Peruvian {{government}} {{investigated the}} accident, {{and in its}} final report concluded that the probable cause of the accident was the improper execution of <b>engine-out</b> procedures by the flight crew, with contributing factors of improper loading of the aircraft and improper maintenance procedures by company personnel. There was also evidence of a coverup and falsification of critical maintenance records by LANSA employees during the investigation process. The Peruvian government subsequently fined LANSA {{and some of its}} employees, and suspended the airline's operating license for 90 days as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|LANSA Flight 502 was a Lockheed L-188A Electra {{operated}} by Líneas Aéreas Nacionales Sociedad Anónima (LANSA) which crashed shortly after takeoff from Quispiquilla Airport near Cusco, Peru, on August 9, 1970, after losing all power {{from one of}} its engines. The four-engine turboprop aircraft, registered OB-R-939, was bound from Cusco to Lima, carrying 8 crew and 92 passengers. All {{but one of the}} occupants died from injuries sustained from impact forces and post crash fire. Two people on the ground were also killed. There were 49 American high school exchange students on board, all of whom perished. A Peruvian government investigation concluded that the accident was caused by improper execution of <b>engine-out</b> procedures by the flight crew, aggravated by lack of maintenance and overloading. LANSA was fined and its operations were suspended for 90 days. At the time, the crash was the deadliest ever in Peruvian history.|$|E

25|$|By 1922 Henry {{founded the}} Berliner Aircraft Company {{with a focus}} on {{conventional}} aircraft.

25|$|The {{spoilers}} {{are highly}} effective, {{even when the}} MU-2 wing is stalled. Some fatal accidents have occurred because normal <b>engine-out</b> procedures for light twin aircraft are not effective when flying the MU-2. The commonly taught procedure of reducing flap following an engine failure on take off leads to a critical reduction in lift in the MU-2 due to the highly effective double-slotted flaps. When pilots were taught to retain take-off flap and to reduce climb rate {{in the event of}} an engine failure, MU-2 accident rates were reduced to almost nil.|$|E
25|$|Chief Designer James C. Floyd {{was upset}} by these developments, {{but in the}} end found a number of {{advantages}} to the four-engine layout. The main advantage was that in an <b>engine-out</b> situation, the aircraft would lose only a quarter of its thrust, rather than half, which made power tolerances easier to meet. In particular, the asymmetry in thrust originally called for a powered rudder to correct for yaw {{in the case of an}} engine failure, but with four engines it was found yaw was so small it could be corrected easily with just the manual trim controls.|$|E
25|$|By June 1945, the {{aircraft}} {{that was to}} become the Canberra bore many similarities to the eventual design, despite the placement of a single, centrally mounted turbojet engine; Petter had held discussions with Rolls-Royce Ltd {{on the topic of}} the development of a scaled-up derivative of the Nene engine. In late 1945, the design was modified further with a pair of engines being adopted instead, initially to be set in the wing roots and later to be mounted in a mid-wing position; this change was made principally due to centre of gravity issues imposed by the position and weight of a heavy bombload and centrally-mounted single engine. The new engine position decreased {{the aircraft}}'s weight by 13 per cent and improved the aircraft's centre of gravity, as well as improved accessibility to the engines and related accessories, downsides were slightly elevated losses in the longer jet pipes and greater yaw during <b>engine-out</b> instances.|$|E

Both F-16 crew members ejected, but their aircraft, on full afterburner, continued on an arc towards Green Ramp and struck a USAF C-141 that was being boarded by US Army paratroopers.

5000|$|The Lancer's {{performance}} when {{flying on}} a single engine is notably poor; in a column for AOPA Pilot, author Barry Schiff summarized the airplane's single-engine performance by writing that [...] "...it doesn’t have any". Since the Lancer's fixed-pitch propellers cannot be feathered in flight, the failed engine's propeller generally continues to windmill, creating prodigious drag and yaw. With the other engine delivering full power, the Lancer's advertised <b>engine-out</b> ceiling is only 2000 ft at standard temperature and pressure - an altitude below ground level in many geographical areas, particularly once adverse density altitude conditions are taken into account. An <b>engine-out</b> situation typically results in a descent rate of about 250 ft/min (1.3 m/s), and the Lancer's single-engine, best-rate-of-climb speed VYSE-generally a gauge of <b>engine-out</b> climb performance for other airplanes-has been characterized as actually being a [...] "single-engine, least-rate-of-coming-down-speed." [...] Flying magazine noted that the craft could generally maintain altitude at or below 2200 ft and was reasonably easy to fly at airfield traffic pattern altitude {{on a single}} engine, but that an <b>engine-out</b> go-around would be potentially risky, and that a pilot is best advised [...] "...to commit or herself to land-then land".|$|E

50|$|The Il-14 was {{developed}} {{as a replacement for}} the widespread Douglas DC-3 and its Soviet built version, the Lisunov Li-2. A development of the earlier Ilyushin Il-12, (that first flew in 1945), the Il-14 was intended for use in both military and civil applications. The Il-12 had major problems with poor <b>engine-out</b> behaviour. Also, it had less payload capability than was originally planned (although the Il-12 was intended to carry 32 passengers, in service it only carried 18, which was uneconomical). The development into the Il-14 was a vast improvement over the Il-12, with a new wing and a broader tailfin. It was powered by two 1,400 kW (1,900 hp) Shvetsov ASh-82T-7 radial piston engines. These changes greatly improved aerodynamic performance in <b>engine-out</b> conditions.|$|E
5000|$|... 30 June 1994 - Airbus Industrie Flight 129, a {{certification}} test {{flight of the}} Airbus 330-300, crashed at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport. While simulating an <b>engine-out</b> emergency just after takeoff with an extreme center of gravity location, the pilots chose improper manual settings which rendered the autopilot incapable of keeping the plane in the air, {{and by the time}} the PIC regained manual control, it was too late. The aircraft was destroyed, killing the flight crew, a test engineer, and four passengers which included Airbus and airline customer VIPs. The investigative board concluded the PIC was overworked from earlier flight testing that day, and was unable to devote sufficient time to the preflight briefing. As a result, Airbus had to revise the <b>engine-out</b> emergency procedures.|$|E

5000|$|The {{power-off}} {{glide ratio}} of a powered parachute ranges from 3:1 to 6:1. Glide ratio {{varies depending on}} the chute size and shape, and the weight that the chute is carrying. Engine-off landings are generally safe, provided that the aircraft is within glide range of a suitable landing zone and the pilot is properly trained {{in the use of}} proper [...] "flaring" [...] technique. [...] "Flaring", in terms of powered parachuting, refers to the usage of the steering bars pushed out simultaneously, causing the aircraft to rock forward. This is caused by the reshaping of the rear of the wing or parachute, which is pulled downwards. This results in the entire aircraft rocking on the lateral axis, thus slowing the aircraft momentarily, allowing an <b>engine-out</b> landing to become less brutal within the last few feet off the ground. Done properly, flaring will allow an <b>engine-out</b> landing to be much smoother than simply relying on the lift of the ram-air canopy to cushion the landing.|$|E

50|$|The C-142 was {{powered by}} four General Electric T64 {{turboshaft}} engines cross-linked {{on a common}} driveshaft, which eliminated <b>engine-out</b> asymmetric thrust problems during V/STOL operations, to drive four 15.5 ft Hamilton Standard fiberglass propellers. Compared to conventional designs it was overpowered: it had 0.27 hp/lb, compared to 0.12 hp/lb for the contemporary Lockheed C-130D Hercules. This extra power was required for safe VTOL operations, and gave the aircraft excellent all-around performance which included a maximum speed of over 400 mph, {{making it one of}} the fastest VTOL transport aircraft of the era.|$|E
