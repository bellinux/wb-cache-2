5|$|Each {{captain had}} {{different}} interpretations of The Rule of the Road believing his ship {{had the right}} of way. Captain John Boutwood of the Curacoa kept to the liner's mean course to maximize his ability to defend the liner from enemy aircraft, while Commodore Sir Cyril G. Illingworth of Queen Mary continued their zig-zag pattern expecting the escort cruiser to <b>give</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland {{has been}} seen as {{reaching}} its peak {{in the first half of}} the sixteenth century, between the reigns of James IV and the deposition of Mary Queen of Scots. The loss of the church as a source of patronage in the 1560s and the court in 1603, changed and limited the further development of Renaissance ideas. In the same period civic humanism began to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to private devotion and retreat from the world influenced by Stoicism. In art and architecture, Renaissance proportion began to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to Mannerism and the more exaggerated style of the Baroque from about 1620.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, {{representative}} {{measures for}} embracing the German-Japanese partnership were sought {{and the construction}} of a new Japanese embassy building in Berlin was started. After the preceding embassy had to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to Hitler's and Albert Speer's plans of re-modeling Berlin to the world capital city of Germania, a new and more pompous building was erected in a newly established diplomatic district next to the Tiergarten. It was conceived by Ludwig Moshamer under the supervision of Speer and was placed opposite the Italian embassy, thereby bestowing an architectural emphasis on the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis.|$|E
25|$|Passenger {{cars are}} as almost {{as old as}} railroading itself, and their {{development}} paralleled that of freight cars.

5|$|Kann {{asserts that}} she {{nevertheless}} possessed qualities appreciated in a monarch: warm heart, practical mind, firm determination and sound perception. Most importantly, {{she was ready}} to recognise the mental superiority of some of her advisers and to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to a superior mind while enjoying support of her ministers even if their ideas differed from her own. Joseph, however, was never able to establish rapport with the same advisers, even though their philosophy of government was closer to Joseph's than to Maria Theresa's.|$|E
5|$|NY120 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US1 (Boston Post Road) {{in the city}} of Rye. The route proceeds northward along Purchase Street as a two-lane street through the Locust Avenue Business District, intersecting a handful of local streets and serving Rye's station on the Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line. Past the station, the highway passes under the New Haven Line, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line, and I-95 in quick succession ahead of the Purchase Street Business District. The commercial surroundings <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to residential neighborhoods after three blocks as NY120 winds northward through the northern part of Rye to the adjacent village/town of Harrison.|$|E
5|$|NY9N and NY22 head {{generally}} northward {{through an}} area of lowlands, which eventually <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to Lake Champlain as the conjoined routes pass into the town of Crown Point. Once again, NY9N serves as the lakeside highway as it follows {{the western edge of}} the lake through the hamlet of Crown Point to the peninsula that gives the town its name. While NY9N and NY22 pass by Crown Point to the west, NY185 directly serves the peninsula and the Crown Point State Historic Site, located at its tip.|$|E

5|$|North of the Long Island Expressway, CR101 {{passes by}} the Christopher Morley Park and Golf Course {{to the east}} and {{residential}} neighborhoods to the west. Past the park, CR101 enters an area with more residential development as it begins to run along the western boundary of Roslyn Estates and the eastern edge of Manhasset. The homes <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to commercial developments as the highway approaches Flower Hill and NY25A (Northern Boulevard). Searingtown Road becomes Port Washington Boulevard and CR101 becomes NY101 upon intersecting NY25A.|$|E
5|$|Past Sunrise Highway, {{the route}} serves many blocks of residences prior to {{entering}} a cloverleaf interchange with the Heckscher State Parkway (exit43). After this junction, NY111 continues north as a two-lane residential {{street to the}} hamlet of Central Islip. Here, the residences <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to various businesses as NY111 and Islip Avenue briefly bend to the northwest for several blocks. Another north-northwesterly stretch follows, bringing the highway over another Long Island Rail Road line, this time the Ronkonkoma Branch. Past the railroad overpass, NY111 intersects with CR100 (Suffolk Avenue), at which point NY111 leaves Islip Avenue and changes names to Joshua's Path.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may {{compete with}} striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes may <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's {{stronger}} jaws can easily tear open flesh {{that is too}} tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even {{when there is no}} food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed. Fox remains are often found in hyena dens, and hyenas may steal foxes from traps.|$|E

5|$|Together with B.attenuata (candlestick banksia), B.menziesii is a {{dominant}} component {{in a number}} of widespread vegetation complexes of the Swan Coastal Plain, including Banksia low woodland and Jarrah-Banksia woodland. These complexes only occur on deep, well-draining sand; in shallower, seasonally wet soils, B.menziesii and B.attenuata <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to other Banksia species such as B.littoralis (swamp banksia) or B.telmatiaea (swamp fox banksia). On the Geraldton Sandplains to the north, B.menziesii usually occurs as a shrub or small tree emergent above low heath.|$|E
5|$|After NY18, NY93 curves to the southeast, serving another {{residential}} stretch {{ahead of}} a junction with YoungstownWilson Road (CR36) on {{the eastern edge of}} Towers Corners. After this intersection, the homes <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to farms as the road heads into rural areas of the town. The route continues on a southeast track through Porter, passing a mixture of rural and residential areas on its way into the hamlet of Porter Center, where NY93 enters an intersection with Porter Center Road (CR57). Another southeastward stretch brings the route across Twelvemile Creek and into the hamlet of Ransomville, where NY93 becomes the community's main street. Through Ransomville, NY93 retains the YoungstownLockport Road name, intersecting with Ransomville Road (CR17) in the hamlet's business district.|$|E
5|$|Anselm stuck {{firmly to}} {{the letter of the}} papal decree, despite Henry's {{attempts}} to persuade him to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> in return for a vague assurance of a future royal compromise. Matters escalated, with Anselm going back into exile and Henry confiscating the revenues of his estates. Anselm threatened excommunication, and in July 1105 the two men finally negotiated a solution. A distinction was drawn between the secular and ecclesiastical powers of the prelates, under which Henry gave up his right to invest his clergy, but retained the custom of requiring them to come and do homage for the temporalities, the landed properties they held in England. Despite this argument, the pair worked closely together, combining to deal with Duke Robert's invasion of 1101, for example, and holding major reforming councils in 1102 and 1108.|$|E

5|$|Architecture {{in modern}} Scotland {{encompasses}} all building in Scotland, between {{the beginning of}} the twentieth century and the present day. The most significant architect of the early twentieth century was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who mixed elements of traditional Scottish architecture with contemporary movements. Estate house design declined in importance in the twentieth century. In the early decades of the century, traditional materials began to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to cheaper modern ones. After the First World War modernism and the office block began to dominate building in the major cities and attempts began to improve the quality of urban housing for the poor, resulted in a massive programme of council house building. The Neo-Gothic style continued in to the twentieth century but the most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and <b>give</b> <b>way</b> {{to the general}} appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high {{in the first few}} months of birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E
