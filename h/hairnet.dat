When braided the cadets hair may be worn in either double or single French braids and in both cases the braids must fall behind the shoulders and not extend past the bottom of the armpit.|$|E
5|$|A precise {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others. British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of art at the Louvre, the women also are wearing a kekryphalos, a <b>hairnet</b> in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate. One {{of the women in}} the stele carries what resembles a bag, presumed to be carrying seeds in the interpretation.|$|E

[...] (NOTE: Though many modern reenactors {{refer to this}} garment as a [...] "snood", {{it is not a}} period term for this article of clothing; snoods were something else entirely.) These <b>hairnets</b> were frequently made of very fine material to match the wearer's natural hair color, but occasionally more elaborate versions were made of thin strips of velvet or chenille (sometimes decorated with beads). Whether plain or resplendent, many <b>hairnets</b> were edged with ruchings of ribbon that would serve to adorn the crown of the wearer's head.|$|R

2500|$|The barbet and fillet or barbet and veil {{could also}} be worn over the crespine, a thick <b>hairnet</b> or snood. [...] Over time, the crespine evolved into a mesh of jeweler's work that {{confined}} {{the hair on the}} sides of the head, and even later, at the back. [...] This metal crespine was also called a caul, and remained stylish long after the barbet had fallen out of fashion. For example, it was used in Hungary until the beginning of the second half of the 15th century, as it was used by the Hungarian queen consort Barbara of Celje around 1440.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hairnets</b> {{are part}} of normal attire for female horse riders and are worn in most equestrian disciplines, {{including}} dressage, eventing, show jumping, and hunting.

Ernestine often snorted when she let loose a barbed response or heard something salacious; she also wore {{her hair in}} a 1940s hairstyle with a <b>hairnet,</b> although the character was contemporary. Her opening lines were often the comical [...] "one ringy dingy... two ringy dingy", and, [...] "is this the party to whom I am speaking?" [...] In the sketches, Ernestine was usually at her switchboard taking calls. She occasionally called her boyfriend, Vito, a telephone repair man, or her pal Phoenicia, another operator.

2500|$|A {{variety of}} hats and headdresses were worn in Europe in the 15th century. The crespine of Northern Europe, {{originally}} a thick <b>hairnet</b> or snood, had {{evolved into a}} mesh of jeweler's work that confined {{the hair on the}} sides of the head by the end of the 14th century. [...] Gradually the fullness at the sides of head was pulled up to the temples and became pointed, like horns (à corné). By mid-15th century, the hair was pulled back from the forehead, and the crespine, now usually called a caul, sat on the back of the head. [...] Very fashionable women shaved their foreheads and eyebrows. Any of these styles could be topped by a padded roll, sometimes arranged in a heart-shape, or a veil, or both. Veils were supported by wire frames that exaggerated the shape and were variously draped from the back of the headdress or covered the forehead.|$|E
2500|$|Most early Western {{images were}} book {{illustrations}} in print form, elaborated {{by a professional}} engraver from either previous images available or some original drawing or sketch supplied by an author, and usually now lost. [...] Seven years after visiting Giza, André Thévet (Cosmographie de Levant, 1556) described the Sphinx as [...] "the head of a colossus, caused {{to be made by}} Isis, daughter of Inachus, then so beloved of Jupiter". He, or his artist and engraver, pictured it as a curly-haired monster with a grassy dog collar. Athanasius Kircher (who never visited Egypt) depicted the Sphinx as a Roman statue, reflecting his ability to conceptualize (Turris Babel, 1679). Johannes Helferich's (1579) Sphinx is a pinched-face, round-breasted woman with a straight haired wig; the only edge over Thevet is that the hair suggests the flaring lappets of the headdress. George Sandys stated that the Sphinx was a harlot; Balthasar de Monconys interpreted the headdress as a kind of <b>hairnet,</b> while François de La Boullaye-Le Gouz's Sphinx had a rounded hairdo with bulky collar.|$|E
50|$|While gel and henna, as {{mentioned}} above, {{were used to}} manage hair, <b>hairnets</b> and pins were in common usage too. Poorer women would have used wooden pins, while the aristocracy used gold, ivory, crystal, silver or painted bone. The pins would have been decorated with carvings of the gods, or beads and pendants.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hairnets</b> {{are used}} to prevent loose hair from contaminating food or work areas. A snood is a net or fabric bag pinned or tied on {{at the back of}} a woman's head for holding the hair. Scarves {{are used to}} protect styled hair or keep it tidy. Shower caps and swim caps prevent hair from {{becoming}} wet or entangled during activity.|$|R
50|$|These <b>hairnets</b> were {{frequently}} made of gold threads, sometimes of silk, or the Elean byssus, and probably of other materials, {{which are not}} mentioned by ancient writers.

50|$|There are a {{range of}} {{possible}} reasons for the objection to hair in food, ranging from cultural taboos to {{the simple fact that}} it is difficult to digest and unpleasant to eat.

The third shape are elaborate pendants with a horizontal bar from which two or three, occasionally four, vertical rods are suspended, usually each decorated with a white bead or pearl at the bottom. Other common ornaments include gold hairpins, often decorated with pearls, fine diadems, and, especially at Antinoopolis, gold <b>hairnets.</b> Many portraits also depict amulets and pendants, perhaps with magical functions.|$|R
