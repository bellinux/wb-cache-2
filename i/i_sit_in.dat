The period saw the singer become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends ... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping {{to find someone to}} talk to. But I just end up coming home." [...] When Jackson turned 21 in August 1979, he hired John Branca as his manager.|$|E

For a number of years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom. By the early 1980s, he was deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends...

500|$|... "The Indians {{acted like}} children; {{they tried to}} cheat each other and got cheated themselves. When it comes my turn to sell my land, I do not think I shall give it up as they did." [...] Regarding {{possible}} future land cessions, he said: [...] "Father I speak for my people, not for myself. I am an old man. My fire is almost outthere is but little smoke. When <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> my wigwam & smoke my pipe, I think of what has past and what is to come, and it makes my heart shake.

500|$|On July 20, Thome hit {{his first}} home {{run with the}} Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field. On August 6, Thome {{was placed on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21. In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot [...] memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time." [...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game. When <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the dugout during games, I talk baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray {{when he was in his}} 40s." [...] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit [...]133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.|$|E

2500|$|Agip {{obtained}} {{an exclusive}} concession for {{gas and oil}} exploration within the national territory, {{and was able to}} retain the profits. Political views were divided: the leftists supporting him, and the conservatives (together with the industrialists), opposing him. At this time Mattei is alleged to have widely used unofficial financial resources of Agip for extensive bribery, especially of politicians and journalists. He used to say of political parties: [...] "I use them like I would use a taxi: <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in,</b> I pay for the trip, I get out". Agip gained control of hundreds of companies in all economic fields in the country. Mattei paid great attention to the press, and Agip soon took possession of several newspapers and two agencies.|$|E
