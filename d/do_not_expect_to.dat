5|$|A {{number of}} new {{crossings}} have been proposed as relief for the Dartford Crossing. The proposed Thames Gateway Bridge to the west was given planning permission by Transport for London (TfL) in December 2004, but was cancelled in November 2008 when Boris Johnson became Mayor of London. Johnson subsequently proposed the Gallions Reach Ferry, a ferry crossing in the same location, as an alternative. The Lower Thames Crossing is a proposed tunnel to the east between Shorne, Kent and South Ockendon, Essex. Thurrock Council suggest that this crossing will be essential for managing congestion. A public consultation on the scheme ended in March 2016, with the route announced in April 2017, though Highways England <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> start construction before 2026.|$|E
25|$|Siblings {{who play}} a major part in each other's lives are {{essential}} to each other. Adult siblings eventually expect the loss of aging parents, the only {{other people who have}} been an integral part of their lives since birth, but they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> lose their siblings early; as a result, when a sibling dies, the surviving sibling may experience a longer period of shock and disbelief.|$|E
25|$|Although jennies {{come into}} heat within 9 or 10 days of giving birth, their {{fertility}} remains low, {{and it is}} likely the reproductive tract has not returned to normal. Thus it is usual to wait one or two further oestrous cycles before rebreeding, unlike the practice with mares. Jennies are usually very protective of their foals, and some will not come into estrus while they have a foal at side. The time lapse involved in rebreeding, and the length of a jenny's gestation, means that a jenny will have fewer than one foal per year. Because of this and the longer gestation period, donkey breeders <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> obtain a foal every year, as horse breeders often do, but may plan for three foals in four years.|$|E

25|$|The next affective {{emotion in}} this {{beginning}} stage is incompetence. Feeling incompetent can spring from multiple {{things in a}} relationship, but during {{the initial stages of}} infidelity a person can experience this on an increased level. Meaning, they begin to notice when their partner does not say thank you for simple things, or they overthink any change made by the unfaithful partner. This can lead to a suspicious partner feeling like they cannot please their significant other and begin to feel incompetent in the relationship. When someone is having incompetent feelings due to someone elseâ€™s actions they begin to resent them creating a build-up and eventually an affective emotion outburst over something small. The faithful partner is not normally aware that their suspicion is the reason they feel incompetent in the relationship, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> be so irritated by the change of simple things; making it an affective response in this stage of infidelity (Miller, 2017). These unanticipated emotions could lead to more and multiple responses such as this one within the future of the initial stage of infidelity.|$|E
25|$|When the {{existence}} of the skin gambling situation was discovered in mid-2016, estimates for the economics of skin gambling market had dropped, but by early 2017, these analysts found the market did not drop as much as they expected, and with gambling sites still open and growing, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> see this diminish in the near future unless the legal matters are resolved. Analysis firm Naruscope estimated in early 2017 that even with increased awareness of the legal ramifications of skin gambling, there could be as much as $12.9 billion gambled this way by 2020, compared to their previous estimate of $20 billion made in mid-2016. Grove places much of the future of skin gambling on Valve and its control over the Steam API that enables the third-party websites; Valve had stated that changing the API to cut off these websites would also affect other legal activities that could be performed with it, making it difficult to enforce without more direct oversight and monitoring by Valve. It is unclear if the two lawsuits against Valve will come to a full trial, and thus attention is being placed on the Washington State Gambling Commission's pending actions to resolve the situation.|$|E

She collaborated with director Gina Vecchione and producer Michelle Price {{to create a}} short silent film called YARNANA, through Kickstarter-based fundraising. [...] "Inspired by the silent film genre, it relies solely on powerful music, sound design and physical expression. The characters speak through modern dance, physical comedy, capoeira, martial arts, poi, belly dancing, breakdance, acrobatics, gymnastics and the instincts of soul searchers." [...] The project's funding was ultimately canceled on Kickstarter, but the film was still created, and it won a film festival award.

[...] "Marty" [...] Bandier, executive for Sony/ATV which owns the copyrights on The Beatles compositions, stated he {{was very interested in}} helping Activision bring a Beatles-themed Guitar Hero title to the market in a similar fashion. [...] Both Activision and MTV Games were in talks with representatives of the Beatles to create a Beatles-themed game, until MTV Games secured an exclusive license with Apple Corps, Ltd. to produce [...] [...] Groups such as Van Halen, The Eagles, Steely Dan and Guns N' Roses have working deals with these companies to include their songs within future games. Other artists, having playing Guitar Hero or Rock Band, may approach the game developers to ask for inclusion of songs specifically for their adaptability into playable tracks. However, not all bands are comfortable with this: Led Zeppelin has turned down offers from both games to include their music due to concerns that Jimmy Page {{and other members of the}} band have with releasing the master recordings of their music. [...] There are also cases where bands want to be included, but the master recordings have been lost or are unusable. Some bands such as the Sex Pistols, Living Colour, and Aerosmith have rerecorded these songs, while other bands have been able to provide concert [...] "live" [...] master recordings. [...] However, some larger artists are unable to do so. [...] Neversoft director Brian Bright states that they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> acquire songs from Pink Floyd and Prince due to such reasons.

2500|$|Most {{allogeneic}} blood donors donate {{as an act}} {{of charity}} and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> receive any direct benefit from the donation. The sociologist Richard Titmuss, in his 1970 book The Gift Relationship: From Human Blood to Social Policy, compared the merits of the commercial and non-commercial blood donation systems of the US and the UK, coming down in favor of the latter. The book became a bestseller in the US, resulting in legislation to regulate the private market in blood. The book is still referenced in modern debates about turning blood into a commodity. [...] The book was republished in 1997 and the same ideas and principles are applied to analogous donation programs, such as organ donation and sperm donation.|$|E
