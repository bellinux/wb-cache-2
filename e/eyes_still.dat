500|$|The {{division}} between Russian and Western critics remained {{through much of}} the 20th century but for a different reason. According to Brown and Wiley, the prevailing view of Western critics was that the same qualities in Tchaikovsky's music that appealed to audiences—its strong emotions, directness and eloquence and colorful orchestration—added up to compositional shallowness. The music's use in popular and film music, Brown says, lowered its esteem in their <b>eyes</b> <b>still</b> further. There was also the fact, pointed out earlier, that Tchaikovsky's music demanded active engagement from the listener and, as Botstein phrases it, [...] "spoke to the listener’s imaginative interior life, regardless of nationality." [...] Conservative critics, he adds, may have felt threatened by the [...] "violence and 'hysteria' [...] " [...] they detected and felt such emotive displays [...] "attacked the boundaries of conventional aesthetic appreciation—the cultured reception of art as an act of formalist discernment—and the polite engagement of art as an act of amusement." ...|$|E
2500|$|In , Snake Eyes is {{a member}} of G.I. Joe. He was given the name [...] "Hebi no me" [...] ("Snake Eyes") by his Arashikage clan sensei, Hard Master, because he {{possesses}} the [...] "steely gaze of a serpent". He cannot speak after having his throat punctured, and just shows up for special missions when called by Scarlett, who can [...] "translate" [...] what he is thinking. He is not used to teamwork, but now that he has joined G.I. Joe, his sense of honor and morality would not let him walk away. In the episode [...] "Dreadnoks Rising", Zartan takes off his visor but puts it back on and says, [...] "You need it more than I do". Snake Eyes' wolf Timber made an appearance in the episode [...] "White Out", where he was rescued by Snake Eyes from a bear trap, before they were assaulted by Storm Shadow and Shadow-Vipers; at the end, Snake Eyes asks Snow Job to watch Timber until he returns. In the episode [...] "Revelations, Part 1", Scarlett learns that Snake Eyes briefly met her father, and promised him to look after his daughter, and he shows signs of having feelings for her. During the time when Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>still</b> spoke, before his throat injury in the episodes [...] "Return of the Arashikage, Parts 1-2", Snake Eyes was voiced by Danny Cooksey.|$|E
