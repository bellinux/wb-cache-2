Scherzinger was hesitant at first, stating in an interview that: [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> to death to touch it [...] afraid for people to hear it before I even wrote it". Scherzinger put her [...] "heart into writing the lyrics and put in themes from the film Slumdog Millionaire. Love and destiny were elements from the movie that she put into the track". She stated that she [...] "prayed every night to do this right". Fair and Iovine additionally hired Brick & Lace, The Writing Camp and Ester Dean to write their own interpretation of the song.|$|E

500|$|Producer Norman Dayron {{recalled}} the young Butterfield as [...] "very quiet and defensive and hard-edged. He was this tough Irish Catholic, {{kind of a}} hard guy. He would walk around in black shirts and sunglasses, dark shades and dark jackets... Paul was hard to be friends with." [...] Although they later became close, Michael Bloomfield commented on his first impressions of Butterfield: [...] "He was a bad guy. [...] He carried pistols. He was down there on the South Side, holding his own. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> to death of that cat". Writer and AllMusic founder Michael Erlewine, who knew Butterfield early in his recording career, described him as [...] "always intense, somewhat remote, and even, on occasion, downright unfriendly". He remembered Butterfield as [...] "not much interested in other people".|$|E
500|$|Tyler next {{appeared}} in Armageddon (1998), where {{she played the}} daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews, {{but it was a}} box office success, earning $553million worldwide. The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|When Bogdanovich was to direct, he {{intended}} to cast Cybill Shepherd, his then girlfriend, {{in the role of}} Carol. As soon as Peckinpah came on to direct, he wanted to cast Stella Stevens with whom he had worked on The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970), with Angie Dickinson and Dyan Cannon as possible alternatives. Foster suggested Ali MacGraw, a much in-demand actress after the commercial success of Love Story (1970). She was married to Robert Evans, who wanted her to avoid being typecast in preppy roles, and set up a meeting for her with Foster, McQueen, and Peckinpah about the film. According to Foster, she was scared of McQueen and Peckinpah because they had reputations as [...] "wild, two-fisted, beer guzzlers". McQueen and MacGraw experienced a strong instant attraction. [...] "He was recently separated and free" [...] she said, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> of my overwhelming attraction to him." ...|$|E

500|$|British pop {{and soul}} singer Jahméne Douglas {{released}} a cover version of [...] "Titanium" [...] on July 22, 2013 {{as the lead}} single from his debut studio album, Love Never Fails (2013). Douglas' version peaked at number 94 on the UK Singles Chart. Talking to Digital Spy, Douglas said: [...] "It's very hard to sing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> {{to do it because}} it's a big chart song and I'm quite old school. For me, the song is about strength and the music video is based around domestic violence and how a woman gets out of it. The lyrics are so powerful for that interpretation. Hopefully if someone is in that situation and watches it, they'll think, I can get out." [...] A music video to accompany the release of [...] "Titanium" [...] was first released onto YouTube on June 12, 2013 at a total length of three minutes and fifty-four seconds. The music video shows Douglas next to a piano, while a story of domestic abuse plays out.|$|E
500|$|McGovern {{enrolled}} at small Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell {{and became a}} star student there. He supplemented a forensic scholarship by working a variety of odd jobs. With World War II underway overseas and feeling insecure about his own courage, McGovern took flying lessons in an Aeronca aircraft and received a pilot's license through the government's Civilian Pilot Training Program. McGovern recalled: [...] "Frankly, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> to death on that first solo flight. But when I walked away from it, I had an enormous feeling of satisfaction that I had taken the thing {{off the ground and}} landed it without tearing the wings off." [...] In late 1940 or early 1941, McGovern had a brief affair with an acquaintance that resulted in her giving birth to a daughter during 1941, although this did not become public knowledge during his lifetime. In April 1941, McGovern began dating fellow student Eleanor Stegeberg, who had grown up in Woonsocket, South Dakota. They had first encountered each other during a high school debate in which Eleanor and her twin sister Ila defeated McGovern and his partner.|$|E
500|$|On 25 June 1967, the Beatles {{performed}} their forthcoming single, [...] "All You Need Is Love", to {{an estimated}} 350 million viewers on Our World, the first live global television link. Released a week later, during the Summer of Love, the song was adopted as a flower power anthem. Two months later, the group suffered a loss that threw their career into turmoil. Having been introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi only the previous night in London, on 25 August they travelled to Bangor for his Transcendental Meditation retreat. Two days later, their manager's assistant, Peter Brown, phoned to inform them that Epstein, only thirty-two years old, had died. The coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose, although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide. Epstein {{had been in a}} fragile emotional state, stressed by personal issues. His death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future. Lennon recalled: [...] "We collapsed. I knew that we were in trouble then. I didn't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared.</b> I thought, 'We've had it now.'" ...|$|E

500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared,</b> I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
500|$|This {{question}} (regarding {{the script}} development) {{was put to}} Ridley Scott by Total Film magazine: [...] "There were lots of rewrites on Hannibal—what was the main problem with the original material?" [...] Scott replied: [...] "That's inaccurate, because {{there were very few}} rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian. If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would be one of them. We discussed Hannibal endlessly." [...] Asked if he had read Mamet's draft, he said: [...] "Yes. He is very fast, very efficient, but he was off doing a film. 'Hannibal' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> {{that he would not be}} able to give me enough attention, because that draft needed a lot of work. So I moved on basically." [...] Scott has said there were writing and [...] "structural problems" [...] as to what they would do with parts of the film. One of Zaillian's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties, meaning the [...] "love" [...] story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by [...] "assault". Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him [...] "sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him." [...] After 25 days Scott suddenly realized that Zaillian was [...] "exorcising the 600 pages of the book. He was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do...Frankly I could have just made it." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> to death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it." [...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E
