40|$|Vinegar {{stands as}} a highly {{appreciated}} fermented food product due to several functional properties and multiple applications. This work focuses on <b>vinegar</b> production from <b>fruit</b> wines derived from fruit concentrates, to attain a food product with nutritional added value. Four <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegars</b> (orange, mango, cherry and banana), were produced and characterized, with total acidities of 5. 3  ±  0. 3 % for orange, 5. 6  ±  0. 2 % for mango, 4. 9  ±  0. 4 % for cherry and 5. 4  ±  0. 4 % for banana. Acetification showed impact on aroma volatiles, mainly related to oxidative reactions. Minor volatiles associated with varietal aroma were identified, monoterpenic alcohols in orange vinegar, esters in banana vinegar, C 13 -norisoprenoids in cherry vinegar and lactones in mango <b>vinegar,</b> indicating <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegars</b> differentiated sensory quality. Total antioxidant activity analysis by FRAP, revealed <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegars</b> potential to preserve and deliver fruit functional properties. Antioxidant activity of <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegars,</b> expressed as equivalents of Fe 2 SO 4, was of 11. 0  ±  1. 67  mmol L 1 for orange, 4. 8  ±  0. 5  mmol L 1 for mango, 18. 6  ±  2. 33  mmol L 1 for cherry and 3. 7  ±  0. 3  mmol L 1 for banana. Therefore, <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegars</b> presented antioxidant activity close to the reported for the corresponding fruit, and between 8 and 40 folds higher than the one found in commercial cider vinegar, demonstrating the high functional potential of these novel vinegar products.

40|$|Since {{consuming}} vinegar on {{a regular}} basis can contribute to the maintenance of good health, many <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegar</b> products are sold in Taiwan. Using 66 fruit vinegars purchased in local markets as samples, this study investigated the labeling, pricing and physicochemical properties of commercial concentrated <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegar</b> in order to understand their production methods and quality. Two out of the 66 samples had no label, while only 29 samples listed nutrient content. According to the labels, 26 of the <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegar</b> samples were made from juice mixed with grain vinegar (JG), while 28 samples were produced from juice via alcoholic and vinegar fermentation (F). The remaining samples were produced by fermentation and mixed with grain vinegar, alcoholic vinegar and juice. Most of the domestic products, such as mei (also called as Japanese apricot), cider, orange, lemon and blended vinegar, were produced by mixing juice with grain vinegar, whereas most imported cider and wine vinegar were produced by fermentation. Wine vinegar had the highest unit price of all <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegar</b> samples. Appearance of these vinegar samples differed significantly. The variations in pH and acidity were less than other physicochemical properties. Total sugar content of vinegar without sugar was less than 3 %, while those with sugar added ranged from 8 % to 64 %. Most imported cider and wine vinegar samples had no sugar added, with the acidity being about 5 similar to 7 %. Most domestic products with sugar added have the average acidity of less than 3 %. Variations in soluble solids content and density of the <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegar</b> were similar to the variation in total sugar content. Besides acetic acid, the major organic acids found in <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegar</b> are malic, lactic and citric acids. Mulberry vinegar was found to be higher in lactic and succinic acids than other <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegar.</b> Red wine vinegar was rich in tartaric, malic and lactic acids. The Chinese National Standards (CNS 14834, N 5239), which regulates edible vinegar focuses on "seasoning vinegar" but not "vinegar beverages".

Thus, appropriate rules are required to regulate vinegar products...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{a rising}} demand for novel food products, enriched with {{functional}} properties, and fruits {{as the main}} source of diversity for food formulations, this work focuses on the application of alcoholic and acetic fermentation processes to obtain novel food products with antioxidant potential. Besides generating differentiated food grade products, fermentation allows an extension of the shelf-life of the raw materials and the use of fruits not suitable for direct sale due to morphological nonconformities or advanced maturation. For this, we used industrially processed concentrates of orange, cherry, mango and banana to produce fruit wines and <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegars.</b> The use of concentrates allowed the production of fruit wines with ethanol yields between 8. 66 ± 0. 51 % (v/v) and 12. 79 ± 0. 23 % (v/v), with characteristics close to a wine grade product. From <b>fruit</b> wines, <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegars</b> were produced with total acidities close to 5 % as expected for this type of vinegar. Total antioxidant activity was assessed in the <b>fruit</b> wines and <b>vinegars</b> by FRAP, allowing an insight of fermentation impact on the antioxidant potential of the fermented fruit products. Orange and cherry wines and vinegars demonstrated higher antioxidant potential when compared with mango and banana wines and vinegars. Antioxidant activities in fruit wines ranged between 7144. 05 ± 770. 41 μmol Fe 2 SO 4 /L for mango wine and 28040. 00 ± 1848. 10 μmol Fe 2 SO 4 /L for cherry wine. In <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegars,</b> antioxidant activities ranged from 3700. 95 ± 349. 41 μmol Fe 2 SO 4 /L for banana vinegar to 18563. 81 ± 2333. 94 μmol Fe 2 SO 4 /L for cherry <b>vinegar.</b> Overall, <b>fruit</b> wines showed 0. 5 to 0. 9 folds higher antioxidant activities than the one reported as naturally occurring in the given fruits. Fermentation impact on antioxidant activity of fruits was low, being observed a reduction of total antioxidant activity from 0. 1 to 0. 2 folds during alcoholic fermentation and in a higher range from 0. 1 to 0. 5 folds in vinegars.

40|$|Background: Vinegars {{based on}} fruit juices could {{conserve}} {{part of the}} health-associated compounds present in the fruits. However, in general very limited knowledge exists on the consequences of vinegar-making on different antioxidant compounds from fruit. In this study vinegars derived from apple and grape are studied. Methods: A number of steps, starting from the fermentation of the fruit juices {{to the formation of}} the final vinegars, were studied from an industrial vinegar process. The effect of each of the vinegar processing steps on content of antioxidants, phenolic compounds and flavonoids was studied, by spectroscopic methods and by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: The major observation was that spectrophotometric methods indicate a strong loss of antioxidant phenolic compounds during the transition from fruit wine to <b>fruit</b> <b>vinegar.</b> A targeted HPLC analysis indicates that metabolites such as gallic acid are lost in later stages of the vinegar process. Conclusion: The major conclusion of this work is that major changes occur in phenolic compounds during vinegar making. An untargeted metabolite analysis should be used to reveal these changes in more detail. In addition, the effect of vinegar processing on bio-accessibility of phenolic compounds was investigated by mimicking the digestive tract in an in vitro set up.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to isolate, {{identify}} and characterize new yeast species of industrial interest. A total of 54 strains were isolated and identified from agricultural raw products and from by-products of the food industry. Among these, four strains were selected, purified and tested for their ability to perform efficient fermentation on Bouslikhène date juice. After the sequencing of the 18 S gene of the ribosomal DNA, the two strains YS-DN 1 and YS-M isolated respectively from dates and molasses have been identified belonging to Saccharomyces cerevisiae species. In addition, the other two strains, YS-OMP and YS-G isolated from olives and grapes belonged to Kluyveromyces marxianus (78 % homology) and Candida utilis (89 % homology) species, respectively. In addition, YS-DN 1 strain showed the highest performance in terms of ethanol production in comparison with two other industrial reference strains. YS-DN 1 strain was the only one that was able to grow at a temperature ranged from 35 to 40 °C in the presence of a high alcoholic concentration and aggressive osmotic pressure condition. Finally, production of the cellular biomass of YS-DN 1 strain was improved by optimization of temperature, Brix and pH fixed respectively at 29. 75 °C, 15. 7 % and 4. 15.

40|$|Vinegar is an {{inexpensive}} commodity, and economic considerations require that a relatively low-cost raw material {{be used for}} its production. An investigation into {{the use of a}} new, alternative substrate – pineapple waste – is described. This approach enables the utilization of the pineapple's (Ananas comosus) peels and core, which are usually discarded during the processing or consumption of the fruit. Using physical and enzymatic treatments, the waste was saccharified, and the resulting substrate was fermented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae for 7 – 10 days under aerobic conditions at 25 °C. This resulted in an alcohol yield of approximately 7 %. The alcoholic medium was then used as a seed broth for acetic fermentation using Acetobacter aceti as the inoculum for approximately 30 days at 32 °C to obtain 5 % acetic acid. Samples were analyzed {{at the beginning and end}} of the acetification cycle to assess the volatile and fixed compounds by GC–MS and UHPLC-QTOF-MS. The metabolomic analysis indicated that L-lysine, mellein, and gallic acid were significantly more concentrated in the pineapple vinegar than in the original wine. Higher alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones characterized the aroma of the final pineapple vinegar, whilst off-flavors were significantly reduced relative to the initial wine.

The strains were isolated from figs, dates, cactus, and traditional fruit vinegars. Four strains, selected from a total of 63 isolates, were confirmed as belonging to Acetobacter species according to biochemical and molecular studies based on 16 s rRNA sequence analysis. Acetous fermentation tests, performed on date and apple fermented juices using selected Acetobacter strains, showed a high capacity of acidification. The most efficient strain KU 710511, isolated from Morrocan cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica), was identified as Acetobacter strain closely related to A. pasteurianus and yielded 42. 5 g/L acidity in apple juice. Cell growth optimization was carried out for KU 710511 using response surface methodology (RSM). The linear, quadratic, and interaction effects of four factors—ethanol, acetic acid, glucose concentrations and pH—were studied by the application of a central composite design. Thirty experiments were designed to predict the maximum concentration of cell biomass.

Analyses using nearly complete 16 S rRNA gene sequences, nearly complete 16 S– 23 S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, as well as concatenated partial sequences of the housekeeping genes dnaK, groEL and rpoB, allocated the micro-organism to the genus Gluconacetobacter, and more precisely to the Gluconacetobacter xylinus group. Moreover, the data suggested that the micro-organism belongs to a novel species in this genus, together with LMG 1693 T, a non-cellulose-producing strain isolated from vinegar by Kondo and previously classified as a strain of Gluconacetobacter xylinus. DNA–DNA hybridizations confirmed this finding, revealing a DNA–DNA relatedness value of 81  % between strains ID 13488 and LMG 1693 T, and values < 70  % between strain LMG 1693 T and the type strains of the closest phylogenetic neighbours. Additionally, the classification of strains ID 13488 and LMG 1693 T into a single novel species was supported by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and (GTG) 5 -PCR DNA fingerprinting data, {{as well as by}} phenotypic data. Strains ID 13488 and LMG 1693 T could be differentiated from closely related species of the genus Gluconacetobacter by their ability to produce 2 - and 5 -keto-d-gluconic acid from d-glucose, their ability to produce acid from sucrose, but not from 1 -propanol, and their ability to grow on 3  % ethanol in the absence of acetic acid and on ethanol, d-ribose, d-xylose, sucrose, sorbitol, d-mannitol and d-gluconate as carbon sources.

5000|$|Like {{other members}} of the vinegar fly family, D. suzukii is small, {{approximately}} 2 to 3.5 mm in length and 5 to 6.5 mm in wingspan [...] and looks like its <b>fruit</b> and <b>vinegar</b> fly relatives. Its body is yellow to brown with darker bands on the abdomen and it has red eyes. The male has a distinct dark spot near the tip of each wing; females do not have the spotted wing. The foreleg of the male sports dark bands on the first and second tarsi. The female has a long, sharp, serrated ovipositor. [...] The larvae are small, white, and cylindrical reaching 3.5 mm in length.|$|R
40|$|Acids and bases are {{the daily}} life topics {{because they are}} in {{everything}} we use in daily life. The tooth paste, the soap, <b>fruits,</b> <b>vinegar</b> and else is the examples of acids and bases which we use so much. Though, they are topics from daily life most of their properties are unknown like hydrolysis. As acids and bases can be strong or weak, their strength can affect their tendency to react with other chemicals, to neutralize another acid or base. This is called hydrolysis. In this experiment I tried to examine the production of hydrolysis based on the strength. According to my hypothesis; hydrolysis is the neutralization reaction which is affected by the strength of the acid or the base. When one of them, the acid or the base, is weak and the other is strong the neutralization reaction cannot be fully finished. The ions coming from the weak one reacts with water and forms its original acid or base. NaOH(sodium hydroxide) is a strong base which can neutralize acids and NH 3 (ammonia) is a weak base which cannot fully neutralize an acid because the ammonium ion coming from NH 3 reacts with water and form NH 3 again. HCl(hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid that can neutralize bases and CH 3 COOH(acetic acid or vinegar acid) is a weak acid and it cannot fully neutralize a base. The experiments that I have done prove my hypothesis with one extra information. As the hydrolysis process is based on the strength of the acid or the base it can also be affected by the molarity of the chemical. Molarity and the strength of acids and bases are the things that affect the occurrence of hydrolysis process as happened during my experiments. The results of my experiments have been affected by the molarity of the solution that I have used...|$|R
25|$|Drosophila melanogaster is {{a species}} of fly (the taxonomic order Diptera) in the family Drosophilidae. The species is known {{generally}} as the common <b>fruit</b> fly or <b>vinegar</b> fly. Starting with Charles W. Woodworth's proposal {{of the use of}} this species as a model organism, D. melanogaster continues to be widely used for biological research in genetics, physiology, microbial pathogenesis, and life history evolution. As of 2017, eight Nobel prizes had been awarded for research using Drosophila.|$|R

This ecologic and economic problem requires alternative uses to be found for fruit. The {{aim of this study}} was to use surplus <b>fruit</b> to produce <b>vinegar</b> by traditional methods (alcoholic fermentation and acetification) from persimmon and strawberry. The process was performed with naturally occurring microorganisms and compared with inoculated commercial wine yeast for alcoholic fermentation. Alcoholic fermentation proceeded faster when inoculated due to the length of the lag phases observed in spontaneous fermentations. The alcoholic fermentations of strawberry mash were faster than those of persimmon mash. In contrast, acetifications were much faster in persimmon (30 days) than in strawberry (70 days), in the latter some acetifications were not finished. From the technologic point of view, to produce persimmon and strawberry wine and vinegar, it is better to avoid fruit pressing and perform the process with fruit mash. Inoculation is recommended for persimmon and is necessary for strawberry. Keywords: wine, <b>vinegar,</b> <b>fruit</b> seasonings, acetic acid bacteri...|$|R
