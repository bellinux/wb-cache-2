40|$|To {{meet the}} {{requirements}} arising from the increased complexity of the power, attitude control and telemetry systems, a full redundant high-performance control section with <b>delayed</b> <b>command</b> capability was designed for the Small Astronomy Satellite- 3 (SAS- 3). The relay command system of SAS- 3 is characterized by 56 bystate relay commands, with capability for handling up to 64 commands in future versions. The 'short' data command service of SAS- 1 and SAS- 2 consisting of shifting 24 -bit words to two users was expanded to five users and augmented with a 'long load' data command service (up to 4080 bits) used to program the telemetry system and the <b>delayed</b> <b>command</b> subsystem. The inclusion of a <b>delayed</b> <b>command</b> service ensures a program of up to 30 relay or short data commands to be loaded for execution at designated times. The design and system operation of the SAS- 3 command section are analyzed, with special attention given to the <b>delayed</b> <b>command</b> subsystem...|$|E
40|$|The {{upgraded}} spacecraft {{control section}} for the Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS-C) incorporates a remarkable amount of flexibility {{for a small}} satellite. Able to point its thrust axis to any direction in space, it can also spin or slow its outer body rotation to zero for star-locked pointing of side viewing experiments. A programmable telemetry system and <b>delayed</b> <b>command</b> system enhance the inherent capability of a spacecraft designed {{to be used for}} a variety of experiments, each of which can be built independently and attached just prior to final acceptance testing and launch. The design of this new spacecraft, whose first launch is scheduled for 1975, is provided in sufficient detail to permit the reader to ascertain its suitability for specific experiments...|$|E
40|$|Trains brakes are {{pneumatically}} actuated and use {{the same}} pneumatic line for power and signal transmission. This simple architecture presents limits for long trains since the last vehicles brakes receive a very <b>delayed</b> <b>command</b> and the train speed must be limited. Solutions were proposed using a signal transmission line parallel to the pneumatic line. These systems, though effective, present drawbacks and are of difficult implementation as retrofits. A solution is described, which leaves the braking system unchanged, but reduces the time delay in the signal transmission by adding a pneumotronic unit at the pneumatic line end. This unit analyzes the pressure time history, recognizes the precursors of new braking commands and issues inputs to a valve at the pneumatic line end mirroring the commands to the master valve. The rapidity of the braking action is enhanced, thereby allowing a more uniform braking and a speed increase of long freight trains...|$|E

The siege {{proved to be a}} total disaster for the British, who lost thousands of men before being forced to withdraw. Although Newcastle had issued the orders, and had overseen the organisation of the expedition, much of the blame for the disaster fell on the shoulders of the ailing Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole.|$|R
40|$|The {{standardized}} {{functional support}} section for the improved Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS) spacecraft, {{which can be}} used virtually without change {{for a wide variety of}} experimental packages and missions, is described. This functional support section makes the spacecraft remarkably flexible for a small satellite. Able to point its thrust axis to any direction in space, it can also spin or slow its outer body rotation to zero for star- or earth-locked pointing of side-viewing experiments. It features a reprogrammable telemetry system, a <b>delayed</b> <b>command</b> system, and an improved control system. Experiments can be built independently and attached to the SAS spacecraft just prior to final acceptance testing and launch. The spacecraft subsystems are described in detail. Included are a summary of the spacecraft characteristics, special design considerations, project reliability requirements, and environmental test conditions. It is intended that this new functional support section afford virtual off-the-shelf availability of the SAS spacecraft to independently built experiments, thus providing quick response time and minimum cost in meeting a wide variety of experimenter needs...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{section of}} the Small Astronomy Satellite- 3 (SAS- 3) launched in May 1975 is an X-ray observatory intended to determine the location of bright X-ray sources to an accuracy of 15 arc-seconds; to study a selected set of sources over a wide energy range, from 0. 1 to 55 keV, while performing very specific measurements of the spectra and time variability of known X-ray sources; and to monitor the sky continuously for X-ray novae, flares, and unexpected phenomena. The improvements in SAS- 3 spacecraft include a clock accurate to 1 part in 10 billion, rotatable solar panels, a programmable data format, and improved nutation damper, a <b>delayed</b> <b>command</b> system, improved magnetic trim and azimuth control systems. These improvements enable SAS- 3 to perform three-axis stabilized observations of any point on the celestial sphere {{at any time of}} the year. The description of the experiment section and the SAS- 3 operation is followed by a synopsis of scientific results obtained from the observations of X-ray sources, such as Vela X- 1 (supposed to be an accreting neutron star), a transient source of hard X-ray (less than 36 min in duration) detected by SAS- 3, the Crab Nebula pulsar, the Perseus cluster of galaxies, and the Vela supernova remnant...|$|E
40|$|Recent DRAM {{specifications}} exhibit increasing refresh latencies. A refresh command blocks a full rank, decreasing available paral-lelism in {{the memory}} subsystem significantly, thus decreasing per-formance. Fine Granularity Refresh (FGR) is a feature recently announced as part of JEDEC’s DDR 4 DRAM specification that at-tempts to tackle this problem by creating a range of refresh options that provide a trade-off between refresh latency and frequency. In this paper, we first conduct an analysis of DDR 4 DRAM’s FGR feature, and {{show that there is}} no one-size-fits-all option across a variety of applications. We then present Adaptive Refresh (AR), a simple yet effective mechanism that dynamically chooses the best FGR mode for each application and phase within the application. When looking at the refresh problem more closely, we identify in high-density DRAM systems a phenomenon that we call command queue seizure, whereby the memory controller’s command queue seizes up temporarily because it is full with commands to a rank that is being refreshed. To attack this problem, we propose two complementary mechanisms called <b>Delayed</b> <b>Command</b> Expansion (DCE) and Preemptive Command Drain (PCD). Our results show that AR does exploit DDR 4 ’s FGR effectively. However, once our proposed DCE and PCD mechanisms are added, DDR 4 ’s FGR becomes redundant in most cases, except in a few highly memory-sensitive applications, where the use of AR does provide some additional benefit. In all, our simulations show that the proposed mechanisms yield 8 % (14 %) mean speedup with re-spect to traditional refresh, at normal (extended) DRAM operating temperatures, for a set of diverse parallel applications. 1...|$|E
50|$|Whenever {{a command}} {{character}} is seen any text accumulated in the parser should be flushed. Since text {{might need to}} be flushed {{when there is no}} command pending, there is a null command known as the ETX command in the C0 command set.There are also two special commands, the Reset and DelayCancel. These must be parsed with lookahead. A <b>Delay</b> <b>command</b> issued previously can be canceled at any time with a DelayCancel command, so once a Delay is seen a decoder must look ahead for a DelayCancel, and only look for a DelayCancel. A Reset command on the other hand is sent to break out from an unknown decoder state and all data before it must be ignored.|$|R

40|$|Robustness is a {{correctness}} notion for concurrent programs running under relaxed consistency models. The task is {{to check}} that the relaxed behavior coincides (up to traces) with sequential consistency (SC). Although computationally simple on paper (robustness {{has been shown to}} be PSPACE-complete for TSO, PGAS, and Power), building a practical robustness checker remains a challenge. The problem is that the various relaxations lead to a dramatic number of computations, only few of which violate robustness. In the present paper, we set out to reduce the search space for robustness checkers. We focus on store-atomic consistency models and establish two completeness results. The first result, called locality, states that a non-robust program always contains a violating computation where only one thread <b>delays</b> <b>commands.</b> The second result, called singularity, is even stronger but restricted to programs without lightweight fences. It states that there is a violating computation where a single store is delayed. As an application of the results, we derive a linear-size source-to-source translation of robustness to SC-reachability. It applies to general programs, regardless of the data domain and potentially with an unbounded number of threads and with unbounded buffers. We have implemented the translation and verified, for the first time, PGAS algorithms in a fully automated fashion. For TSO, our analysis outperforms existing tools...|$|R

We then study the scalability of delay-tolerant botnets. Specifically, we apply mathematical analysis to derive the average delay required to distribute a command to all bots in three types of command and control architectures: centralised, distributed, and hybrid delay-tolerant botnets. We find that in all cases, the delay increases approximately logarithmically {{with the number of}} bots, indicating that the delay-tolerant botnets are scalable. Finally, we verify the analytical results by simulations...|$|R

40|$|Since {{under the}} UMTS framework, the {{development}} of S-UMTS follows that of T-UMTS with the ultimate aim of achieving close integration between S-UMTS and T-UMTS air-interface designs, closed-loop transmit power control (TPC) remains a physical-layer procedure option for enhancing the performance of S-UMTS. In S-UMTS, however, closed-loop TPC should be modified {{to take into account}} large TPC <b>command</b> <b>delays</b> due to propagation. In this thesis, we study strength-based closed-loop TPC schemes for S-UMTS in order to develop TPC schemes that mitigate the effects of TPC <b>command</b> <b>delays</b> due to propagation. The study focuses on link-level analysis of the SW-CDMA based air-interface for the S-UMTS. Firstly, a mathematical model describing the dynamic behaviour of the closed-loop TPC has been developed as a stochastic difference equation, where the effects of TPC <b>command</b> <b>delays</b> in the presence of random disturbance are modelled as a random walk process, with a probability density function (pdf) of the TPC error process as its solution. The pdf is obtained by solving a corresponding Fokker-Planck equation whose derivate moments are obtained via statistical linearisation. The results show that although it is widely accepted that the TPC error process is lognormally distributed, the nonlinearity due to the fixed TPC step-size may flatten the pdf when the TPC delays and step-size are large. Secondly, predictive TPC schemes that mitigate the effects of delays and adaptive techniques that improve upon the performance offered by standard algorithms have been proposed and evaluated through Monte-Carlo simulations. In particular, a simple LMS algorithm has been chosen as an appropriate tracking algorithm for the predictive TPC schemes in S-UMTS, and in order to improve upon the performance offered by the standard LMS algorithm, a filter-shaped LMS algorithm for predictive TPC has been proposed for S-UMTS. Furthermore, the simulation results have shown that step-size adaptation, when complemented with power prediction, significantly improves the performance of the closed-loop TPC schemes even in the presence of TPC <b>command</b> <b>delays.</b> Finally, numerical results have shown that the accuracy of TPC has significant influence on the capacity. For example, a modest improvement in the standard deviation of the TPC error from 1. 5 dB to 1. 0 dB may yield a capacity improvement from 21 to 32 users per spotbeam: a relative gain of approximately 50 %. Therefore, closed-loop TPC remains an important radio resource management procedure for mitigating slow-fading due to shadowing in S-UMTS, power prediction mitigates the effects of TPC <b>command</b> <b>delays,</b> and more accurate TPC schemes are necessary to realise high capacity S-UMTS networks...|$|R
40|$|We parsimoniously {{characterize}} {{the severity of}} market frictions affecting a stock using the delay with which its price responds to information. The most <b>delayed</b> firms <b>command</b> a large return premium not explained by size, liquidity, or microstructure effects. Moreover, delay captures part of the size effect, idiosyncratic risk is priced only among the most delayed firms, and earnings drift is monotonically increasing in delay. Frictions associated with investor recognition appear most responsible for the delay effect. The very small segment of delayed firms, comprising only 0. 02 % of the market, generates substantial variation in average returns, highlighting the importance of frictions.

40|$|SDRAM is {{commonly}} used in cost-sensitive applications requiring large amounts of memory. Though SDRAM is inexpensive, the implementation of refresh operations, open row management, and various <b>delays</b> and <b>command</b> sequences requires logic. The Nios SDRAM Controller with an Avalon interface, transparently handles SDRAM initialization, refresh, and all other SDRAM requirements and appears to software as a simple linear memory interface (flat address space) with a wait signal. The SDRAM Controller supports standard SDRAM as described in PC 100. With the SDRAM Controller, users can access SDRAM subsystems with data widths of 8, 16, 32, or 64 -bits, various memory sizes, and multiple chip selects.
