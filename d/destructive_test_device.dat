50|$|Analysis of {{a failed}} part can be done using <b>destructive</b> <b>testing</b> or {{non-destructive}} <b>testing.</b> <b>Destructive</b> <b>testing</b> involves removing a metal component from service and sectioning the component for analysis. <b>Destructive</b> <b>testing</b> gives the failure analyst the ability to conduct the analysis in a laboratory setting and perform tests on the material that will ultimately destroy the component. Non <b>destructive</b> <b>testing</b> is a test method that allows certain physical properties of metal to be examined without taking the samples completely out of service.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} the SiC MOSFET withstanding time for single fault events greatly influences {{the requirements for}} device protection circuits for these devices in power converter applications, like voltage source inverters or power electronic transformers. For this reason, a thermal model, based on the structural design and the physical dimensions of the chip as well as material properties of 4 H-SiC, is proposed. This article gives a general description of the thermal behaviour of vertical SiC MOSFET under various driving and boundary conditions {{in case of a}} short-circuit event. The thermal model substitutes <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> of a <b>device</b> for an individual set of boundary conditions of an occurring fault event. The validity of the analytically parametrised thermal model is verified by experimental short-circuit tests of state-of-the-art vertical SiC MOSFETs for a set of various boundary conditions. The investigated thermal model can furthermore be used to standardise different gate-oxide degradation values from the literature for means of lifetime prediction of the gate oxide for an individual application under repetitive occurring fault or overload conditions. These manufacturer specific reported values measured with no standardised testing procedures can be translated into a maximum junction temperature, which is repeatedly reached. The thermal model therefore provides a unifying parameter for the gate-oxide lifetime calculation for an individual chip and application...|$|R

Consequently, the transmission measurement from array A to array C shows a defect at a bond position between 3 and 4  cm. The <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> shows a large defect in area a in this seam section. In the area b, the transmission measurement from the array B to the array C shows a defect at the position between 1.5 and 5  cm. Here too, the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> shows a significantly reduced amount of adhesive than in the following areas. However, the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> shows that test area c is filled with adhesive over the entire sample length.|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of non <b>destructive</b> <b>testing</b> of {{concrete}} structures, several regulations propose correlations between cubic compressive strength and ultrasonic pulse velocity or pull out extraction force respectively. These correlations are expressed by means of coefficients derived from calibration through <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> carried out on cores. Aiming at evaluating the reliability of correlations in predicting concrete compressive strength, an experimental campaign has been started. Several concrete cubic specimens of different strength classes have been prepared and non <b>destructive</b> <b>tested.</b> Moreover, 16 cores have been extracted from the cubic specimens and ultrasonic and compressive tests {{have been carried out}} on them. Ultrasonic testing has been performed on both cubic specimens and cores in order to assess the influence of specimen form and dimension on the ultrasonic waves propagation. In this paper results of the experimental campaign are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies with ultrasonic nondestructive testing and wood fiber composites. The problem {{of the study was}} to ascertain whether ultrasonic nondestructive testing can be used in place of <b>destructive</b> <b>testing</b> to obtain the modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the wood/agricultural material with comparable results. The uniqueness of this research is that it addressed the type of content (cornstalks and switchgrass) being used with the wood fibers and the type of adhesives (soybean-based) associated with the production of these composite materials;Two research questions were addressed in the study. The major objective was to determine if one can predict the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> MOE value based on the nondestructive test MOE value. The population of the study was wood/agricultural fiberboards made from wood fibers, cornstalks, and switchgrass bonded together with soybean-based, urea-formaldehyde, and phenol-formaldehyde adhesives;Correlational analysis was used to determine if there was a relationship between the two tests. Regression analysis was performed to determine a prediction equation for the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> MOE value. Data were collected on both procedures using ultrasonic nondestructing testing and 3 -point destructive testing;The results produced a simple linear regression model for this study which was adequate in the prediction of destructive MOE values if the nondestructive MOE value is known. An approximation very close to the entire error in the model equation was explained from the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> MOE values for the composites. The nondestructive MOE values used to produce a linear regression model explained 83 % of the variability in the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> MOE values. The study also showed that, for the particular <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> values obtained with the equipment used, the model associated with the study is as good as it could be due to the variability in the results from the destructive tests;In this study, an ultrasonic signal was used to determine the MOE values on nondestructive tests. Future research studies could use the same or other hardboards to examine how the resins affect the ultrasonic signal...|$|R

40|$|Stone decay is {{affected}} by the influence of climatic factors. In particular marble degradation, that could be expressed by decohesion and /or bowing, is mainly due to the action of temperature and water (rains and relative humidity). In this work non <b>destructive</b> and <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed to evaluate the decay of marble slabs subjected both to natural exposition and to artificial ageing tests (Lab - Bow test). Measurements of Ultrasonic Pulse Velocities (UPV) and bowing have been executed periodically on marble slabs exposed for a period of four years as preliminary field tests. On the base of this work an integrated test methodology to monitoring and previewing the behaviour of faÃ§ade slabs have been set up. The methodology has been applied on the marble faÃ§ade of modern building of centre Italy and consists of in situ and laboratory tests. In laboratory a <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> (flexural strength) has been added to the non <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> to evaluate the decay before and after cycles of an ageing test. The results of the analysis, show an evaluative trend of the decay, though it changes its slope after 25 cycles of the ageing test. Moreover this work confirms the effectiveness of the employed non <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> and their god correlation with the mechanical tests...|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} on the testing of concrete elasticity {{has been done in}} order to measure concrete compressive strength using a non <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> based on sonic wave velocity. An equipment that was used for this research was a Sonic Wave Analyzer (SOWAN). In this research, concrete samples were formed in cylindrical shape with 15 cm diameter and 30 cm length. The compressive strengths of this concrete were 19, 23, and 25 (⁄). After that the time delay of sonic wave was measured. The research results showed that primary and secondary sonic wave velocity, elasticity, and compressive strenght were = 3525 m/s, = 1950 m/s, 23240 x N/, and 24 x (⁄) respectively. Based on the data, it was concluded that this non <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> based on sonic wave velocity can be used to measure the concrete compressive strength, because the values obtained were comparable to the values obtained using the Universal Testing Machine (UTM) which is a <b>destructive</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R
40|$|Non <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} {{applied in the}} industrial context for their strong potentialities in improving and standardizing quality control. Especially in the intermediate manufacturing stages, early detection of defects on semi-finished products allow their direction towards later production processes according to their quality, with consequent considerable savings in time, energy, materials and work. However, the raw data coming from non <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> systems are not always immediately suitable for sophisticated defect detection algorithms, due to noise and disturbances which are unavoidable, especially in harsh operating conditions, {{such as the ones}} which are typical of the steelmaking cycle. The paper describes some pre-processing operations which are required in order to exploit the data coming from a non <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> system.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of an oxide core <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> {{program at the}} Spert I reactor facility are reviewed. The proposed experimental program of <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> on a low-enriched oxide core, the experimental results of nondestructive transient tests that were obtained on the test core and the extrapolation of these results to the destructive case, {{an analysis of the}} hazards involved in performing such <b>destructive</b> <b>tests,</b> and {{a detailed description of the}} reactor facility and environmental conditions are presented. The supervision and control of personnel during and after each <b>destructive</b> <b>test,</b> and of the plans for reentry, cleanup, and restoration of the facility are discussed. The water- moderated core that will be used for these experiments is mounted in the Spert I open-type reactor vessel, which has no provision for pressurization or forced coolant flow. The core is comprised of approximately 600 4 %-enriched UO/sub 2 / fuel rods clad with stainless steel, and four blade-type, gang-operated control rods for reactor control. Reactor transients are initiated at ambient temperature by step-insertions of reactivity, using for this purpose a special control rod that can be quickly ejected from the core. On the basis of the results obtained from previous nondestructivelkinetic tests, an analysis was made to determine the nature of the results to be expected for an assumed 1. 8 - sec- period test in which tetal core destruction occurs. An evaluation of hazards involved in conducting the 1. 8 -msec test, based on conservative assumptions regarding fission product release and weather conditions, indicated that with the procedural controls normally exercised in the conduct of any transient test at Spert and the special controls to be in effect during the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> series, no significant hazard to personnel or to the general public will be incurred.
