2500|$|After {{the conference}} Chauvel ordered the Australian Mounted Division to {{ride back to}} Karm in the {{afternoon}} to ease the water at Beersheba. The division's horses had had their last proper drink at Khalasa on 30 October, as the water supply at Asluj and Beersheba had been restricted. As all the tents had been pulled down the previous day {{in preparation for a}} move, the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance did dressings outside during the morning. Orders were received a noon and after lunch the field ambulance, {{along with the rest of}} their brigade rode out at 14:00 back to Karm where they arrived at 22:00. It was a [...] "terrible ride in the dust ... direct through Beersheba and Buggar. The dust was so thick you could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the camel ahead and follow on. We lost the Brigade and camped for the night at Karm." [...] The Australian Mounted Divisional Train (less the 5th Mounted Brigade's 38 Coy but with 7th Mounted Brigade Train), reached Karm at 23:00 after leaving Beersheba at 16:00.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{can only}} <b>just</b> <b>make</b> them <b>out</b> now, Messer Francisco, {{and as we}} shall have the {{buildings}} behind us, {{they will not be}} able to see us as well as we can see them. I think we can go now." ...|$|R

You can <b>just</b> <b>make</b> him <b>out,</b> there on the upper balcony. He is the darlingest child, with ash-blond hair cut Dutch style. I wonder if you didn't look like him when you were a boy, with your light hair?" ...|$|R
40|$|Taken {{from second}} {{story of our}} bungalow, showing a bit of our bark roof in foreground. Shows lower hills below us, with clouds. This was taken {{specially}} to show the rivers in the plain, [...] and you can <b>just</b> <b>make</b> them <b>out,</b> as small white lines. " A long view of hills, portions of which have clouds hovering around them. Part of a roof is visible in the foreground...|$|R
60|$|Bathurst {{stepped out}} and looked up. He could but <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> {{the figure of}} Rabda, {{seemingly}} already higher than {{the top of the}} bungalow. Gradually it became more and more indistinct.|$|E
60|$|Here by {{the statue}} {{we took our}} stand, and waited. Sir Henry and I close together, Umslopogaas some paces off in the darkness, so that I could only <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> his towering outline leaning on the outline of an axe.|$|E
60|$|In a {{very few}} seconds it was done, and looking astern, Augusta could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> {{something}} black that seemed to float {{for a second or}} two upon the water, and then disappear into its depths. It was the shattered hull of the whaler.|$|E
500|$|Andy Warhol: Oh God, yes, it's true, the tin {{flowers were}} {{made out of}} those fruit cans, that's the reason why I did my first tin-can {{paintings}} ... You take a tin-can, the bigger the tin-can the better, like the family size ones that peach halves come in, and I think you cut them with scissors. It's very easy and you <b>just</b> <b>make</b> flowers <b>out</b> of them. My mother always had lots of cans around, including the soup cans.|$|R
60|$|Joe {{was about}} {{to return to the}} mess-hall when he chanced to see two figures sneaking along in the semi-darkness, in the {{direction}} of the woods. He was <b>just</b> able to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> that the pair were Reff Ritter and Gus Coulter when they disappeared behind the trees.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} the dam the fox stopped. Sparrer could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> him <b>out</b> {{through the}} tangled screen of brush. For a moment he stood motionless. It seemed to the boy like adding insult to injury. Then with a long graceful leap he landed on the snow of the swamp. A sudden hope caused Sparrer to instinctively tighten his grip on the rifle and catch his breath. Perhaps the fox would come his way! If he should, well, he would at least find a true Scout--he would be prepared.|$|R
60|$|Wyllard could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the schooner, {{which had}} {{apparently}} followed them, a blurr of dusky canvas against {{a bank of}} haze, and then, as the boat slid down into a hollow, {{there was nothing but}} the low-hung, lowering sky. It was evident to him that if they were to make a landing it must be done promptly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not being {{possessed of}} {{the eyes of a}} heagle or a cat, sir, I did not," [...] Burdett replied. [...] "Just you look round and see what sort of a night it is. Why, I can only <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> your outline, sir; {{although}} I've been looking at you this five minutes, I can't see nothing of your face." ...|$|E
60|$|By the aid {{of their}} sword-bayonets the Franc-tireurs soon pierced the wall, and lying at full length a yard apart, replied to the enemy's fire. Through the smoke they could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the upper line of the wall, and as the Prussians stood up to fire picked them off. Henri Vaucour crept along the line urging the men to fire slowly.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{will not}} do, Giuseppi. The woman {{would refuse to}} speak, and though they could force her {{to do so in}} the dungeons, the girls would be sure to be removed the moment it was known she was captured. We must follow them, and see where they go to. Let us get well behind them, so that we can <b>just</b> <b>make</b> them <b>out</b> in the distance. If they have a {{suspicion}} that they are being followed, they will land her at the first steps and slip away from us." ...|$|R
5000|$|The reality therapy {{approach}} to counseling and problem-solving {{focuses on the}} here-and-now actions of the client {{and the ability to}} create and choose a better future. Typically, clients seek to discover what they really want and how they are currently choosing to behave in order to achieve these goals. According to Glasser, the social component of psychological disorders has been highly overlooked in the rush to label the population as sick or mentally ill. [...] Reality therapy attempts to separate the client from the behavior. Just because someone is experiencing distress resulting from a social problem does not make him sick; it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> him <b>out</b> of sync with his psychological needs.|$|R
50|$|The station {{closed to}} {{passengers}} on 2 December 1963, {{a victim of}} the Beeching Axe. Goods traffic continued until 1 July 1964, although the private siding continued in use for some time. Of the first station all that remains is the footbridge (although the deck has been replaced with concrete), but it is <b>just</b> possible to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the old paths down to the platforms. The station master's house is now in residential use.|$|R
60|$|At {{first the}} {{darkness}} {{appeared to be}} absolutely pitchy, but {{in a few minutes}} our eyes became so far accustomed to it that we could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> each other's presence--very dimly and vaguely, it is true. I could see nothing else in the room--only the black loom of the motionless figures. We were all taking the matter much more seriously than we had ever done before.|$|E

I {{could only}} <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the winder by the pale starlight that shone through it, {{but the moment}} I set my two eyes on it, wot does I see?

60|$|I keep {{straight}} on, {{and come}} in due time to the first on the right: a narrow dull street, where I see a well-favoured man of good stature and military bearing, in a great cloak, standing at a door. Drawing nearer to this threshold, I see it is the threshold of a small wine-shop; and I can <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> in the dim light, the inscription that it is kept by Giovanni Carlavero.|$|E
500|$|Preliminary {{designer}} Dick Scherrer requested possible shapes {{upon which}} he could base his low radar cross-section (RCS) design. He was introduced to Denys Overholser, who recommended an aircraft with flat surfaces. Overholser later recounted his discussion with Sherrer: [...] "When Dick Scherrer asked me ... I said 'Well, it's simple, you <b>just</b> <b>make</b> it <b>out</b> of flat surfaces, and tilt those flat surfaces over, sweeping the edges away from the radar view angle, and that way you basically cause the energy to reflect away from the radar.'" [...] Scherrer subsequently drew a preliminary low-RCS aircraft with faceted surfaces. At the same time, Overholser hired mathematician Bill Schroeder, {{with whom he had}} a prior working relationship – in fact, it was Schroeder who trained Overholser on mathematics relating to stealth aircraft. Kenneth Watson was hired as the senior lead aircraft designer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Harkee to me, deary,' pursued Mrs Boffin, taking Bella's hands {{between her}} own, and gently beating on them {{from time to}} time. 'It was after a {{particular}} night when John had been disappointed--as he thought--in his affections. It was after a night when John had made an offer to a certain young lady, and the certain young lady had refused it. It was after a particular night, when he felt himself cast-away-like, and had {{made up his mind}} to go seek his fortune. It was the very next night. My Noddy wanted a paper out of his Secretary's room, and I says to Noddy, [...] "I am going by the door, and I'll ask him for it." [...] I tapped at his door, and he didn't hear me. I looked in, and saw him a sitting lonely by his fire, brooding over it. He chanced to look up with a pleased kind of smile in my company when he saw me, and then in a single moment every grain of the gunpowder that had been lying sprinkled thick about him ever since I first set eyes upon him as a man at the Bower, took fire! Too many a time had I seen him sitting lonely, when he was a poor child, to be pitied, heart and hand! Too many a time had I seen him in need of being brightened up with a comforting word! Too many and too many a time to be mistaken, when that glimpse of him come at last! No, no! I <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>out</b> to cry, [...] "I know you now! You're John!" [...] And he catches me as I drops.--So what,' says Mrs Boffin, breaking off in the rush of her speech to smile most radiantly, 'might you think by this time that your husband's name was, dear?' ...|$|R
5000|$|It is <b>just</b> {{possible}} to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> {{the remains of}} a stone jetty and the ruins of a lime kiln nearby. Here the limestone was burnt to provide farmers with the lime to spread on their fields. The limestone carrier Laurina was wrecked at Kilve in 1876. The Pill was long associated with smuggling and legend has it that barrels of spirits hidden in the chantry were deliberately set fire to as the revenue men appeared on the scene. Legend also has it that the smugglers' ponies were taught to respond to the commands [...] "whoa" [...] and [...] "gee up" [...] in the reverse sense of the words.|$|R
60|$|The old gentleman, after a moment's hesitation, {{lifted the}} latch {{of the door}} {{somewhat}} nervously. I affected to take no notice of him, so breathless was the haste with which our immense business connection compelled me to finger the keyboard: but, {{looking up at him}} under my eyelashes, I could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> he was a peculiarly bland and urbane old person, dressed with the greatest care, and some attention to fashion. His face was smooth; it tended towards portliness.|$|E
60|$|Shaken {{up by the}} {{changing}} moods of passion and tenderness, {{he must have been}} ready for any extravagance of conduct. Knowing the profound silence each night brought to that nook of the country, I could imagine them having the feeling of being the only two people on the wide earth. A row of six or seven lofty elms just across the road opposite the cottage made the night more obscure in that little garden. If these two could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> each other that was all.|$|E
60|$|They {{found the}} hollow under the cliff {{to be less}} than two yards deep and of about the same width. The rocks {{overhead}} hung down so that they touched Dave's head. In front was a small snowdrift, looking over which father and son could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the two bears, as they squatted on the ground between the firs. The beasts did considerable growling and did what they could {{to take care of their}} wounds, yet they showed no disposition to leave that vicinity.|$|E
5000|$|Modern Western art {{is either}} an {{expression}} of the artists' inner turmoil and tensions or mere feats of colour and form. Mostly it is aimless or personal fad. Can such art ever become popular and useful to society at large? But capitalist society has accepted it as a form of business transactions. They collect art and sell art <b>just</b> to <b>make</b> capital <b>out</b> of it. In a poor country like India art cannot fulfill that aim. Art can have no other aim but to serve the people, to inspire and educate them, to prepare them for a better life and society. And [...] "Samikshavad" [...] aims at that.|$|R
5000|$|Sham 69 {{were still}} contractually bound {{to deliver a}} further two albums for Polydor and with Cook and Jones signed to Virgin this meant Virgin coming to an {{arrangement}} with Polydor. Pursey had {{wanted to use the}} name 'The Sex Pistols' while Paul Cook later stated that he and Jones had no intention of using the name. Pursey had told Gary Bushell [...] "Now I feel that the Pistols can be a band that have something to say. We're not digging the name up <b>just</b> to <b>make</b> money <b>out</b> of it like Virgin did with Vicious". Simon Draper, Managing Director of Virgin Records told Melody Maker [...] "Whoever joins Cook and Jones {{will be part of the}} Sex Pistols".|$|R
5000|$|Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A and wrote, [...] "The climactic {{visit to the}} flower {{wholesalers}} market is a wonderful bit of Bob’s Burgers silliness, with a setup that feels simultaneously ridiculously and deeply plausible, if only because the whole thing works because all those flower sellers take the whole black-market carnation-selling thing so seriously. It even all culminates in the perfect little romantic note, as Bob and Linda admit they have been far too busy helping the kids to get anything for each other. But hey, they can always <b>just</b> go <b>make</b> <b>out.</b> And if that’s not a Valentine’s Day sentiment for all to get behind, I don’t know what is." [...] Sean Fitz-Gerald from Vulture gave the episode a positive review by saying, [...] "Those perks, coupled with the tiny advances in Gene's maturation and Tina's love life, made [...] "The Gene & Courtney Show" [...] another triumph in this series' already-strong repertoire of holiday material. And for what it's worth, after Gene pours his heart out to Courtney, he's also rewarded with a kiss — a strategically placed wrench in their story line." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rangers or a posse of ranchers {{in pursuit}} of a fugitive! The {{knowledge}} gave Duane a strange thrill. Certainly they could not have been hunting him. But the feeling their proximity gave him was identical to what it would have been had he been this particular hunted man. He held his breath; he clenched his teeth; he pressed a quieting hand upon his horse. Suddenly he became aware that these horsemen had halted. They were whispering. He could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> a dark group closely massed. What had made them halt so suspiciously? ...|$|E
60|$|An hour elapsed {{before any}} {{movement}} was visible. Then Francis {{heard the sound}} of footsteps, and could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the figures of persons descending the steps and entering the gondola. Then the boat moved out {{into the middle of the}} canal, where a few boats were still passing to and fro. Francis kept his gondola close by the bank, so as to be in the deep shade of the houses. The boat they were following again passed under the Ponto Maggiore, and for some distance followed the line of the Grand Canal.|$|E
6000|$|Midway up I {{checked and}} looked back across the wide water. The light had grown quite strong by now, and in the east there was a faint pink flush to herald the {{approaching}} sun. Away beyond the river, moving southward, I could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the Legate's little cavalcade. And then, for the first time, a question leapt in my mind concerning the litter whose leathern curtains had remained so closely drawn. Whom did it contain? Could it be Giuliana? Had Cosimo spoken the truth {{when he said that}} she had gone to Gambara for shelter? ...|$|E
60|$|He moved forward. A {{few steps}} {{took him to}} the doorway. The chamber before him was darker than the corridor, so that he could <b>just</b> indistinctly <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the objects in the room. He saw a {{sleeping}} dais near the center, with a darker blotch of something lying on the marble floor beside it. He moved a step farther into the doorway and the scabbard of his sword scraped against the stone frame. To his horror he saw the sleeping silks and furs upon the central dais move. He saw a figure slowly arising to a sitting posture from the death bed of O-Mai the Cruel. His knees shook, but he gathered all his moral forces, and gripping his sword more tightly in his trembling fingers prepared to leap across the chamber upon the horrid apparition. He hesitated just a moment. He felt eyes upon him--ghoulish eyes that bored through the darkness into his withering heart--eyes that he could not see. He gathered himself for the rush--and then there broke from the thing upon the couch an awful shriek, and O-Tar sank senseless to the floor.|$|R

5000|$|The {{beach at}} Kilve was {{described}} by William Wordsworth, the Romantic poet, as [...] "Kilve's delightful shore". Kilve Pill, where the stream from Holford runs into the sea, was once a tiny port, used for importing culm, an inferior type of coal which {{was used in the}} limeburning process. It was also the site for [...] "glatting" [...] which was the hunting of conger eels by dogs. On the shore a Saint Keyne serpent can be seen, which a local legend says is a snake turned to stone, but is in reality an ammonite. It is <b>just</b> possible to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the remains of a stone jetty and the ruins of a lime kiln nearby.
