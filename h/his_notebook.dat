Cheeseman had been educated in Germany, knew the language and felt able to recognise a German accent; he noticed that Lody's American accent slipped from time to time, presumably due to stress, and became convinced that the man was German.|$|E

For the next few days, Jess and Leslie spend their free time in the tree house getting to know each other.|$|E
