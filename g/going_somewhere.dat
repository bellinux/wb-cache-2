Demme responded that Thomas Harris, author of The Silence of the Lambs, {{had been working on}} the follow-up for [...] "seven or eight years". Demme had an idea even at that time {{that it would not be}} a straight follow-up. Harris had told Demme: [...] "I imagine Doctor Lecter <b>going</b> <b>somewhere</b> in Europe... strolling round the streets of Florence or Munich, gazing in the windows of watchmakers..." [...] Demme stated his intention to be involved in the film adaptation of Hannibal in 1998, less than a year before the novel was published.|$|E

[...] Reviewers were enthusiastic about the band's performances; according to Gardiner, [...] "The impression they now generate on stage is one of total energy... energy which sets them apart."

500|$|According to Campbell, The Monarchy Stylites remix of [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] "pump extra oomph" [...] {{into the}} song, with {{addition}} of drum beats. Richard Vission's remix of [...] "Just Dance" [...] introduced an elastic rhythm in the song, while Frankmusik changed the soft composition of [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] {{to a more}} upbeat one, also manipulating Gaga's vocals in the process. Campbell also added that the Passion Pit remix of [...] "Telephone" [...] felt like a [...] "theatrical set up for a song that feels like it's <b>going</b> <b>somewhere,</b> but never does"; the remix consists of synths, with a thumping beat accompanying the song. Sound of Arrows remixed [...] "Alejandro", changing the dark nature of its music into a bright, summery jam while [...] "Bad Romance" [...] was remixed by Starsmith, making it a complete dance track.|$|E

Fickett also noticed many similarities to The X-Files, writing [...] "not enough {{is being done to}} move the show into its own direction"; he concluded [...] "The production values are exceptional, the acting is top notch, and it certainly seems to be <b>going</b> <b>somewhere.</b> Where, is another matter all together, but {{there does seem to be}} momentum." [...] Website blogger io9 highlighted [...] "The Arrival" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to understand the show. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "The Arrival" [...] the twelfth best episode of the series, explaining the episode [...] "formally, memorably introduced the Observer known as September (Michael Cerveris), a Tabasco-loving, Fedora-wearing, bald-headed time traveling surveyor from the future. His altercation with Peter in the graveyard — mirroring his movements; parroting his speech in real time — was one of the show's earliest water-cooler-weird moments." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{journalist}} wrote, in {{the late}} 1890s, that Leno was [...] "probably the highest paid funny man in the world". In 1898, Leno, Herbert Campbell and Johnny Danvers formed a consortium to build the Granville Theatre in Fulham, which was demolished in 1971. Leno published an autobiography, Dan Leno: Hys Booke, in 1899, ghostwritten by T. C. Elder. Leno's biographer J. Hickory Wood commented: [...] "I can honestly say that I never saw him absolutely at rest. He was always doing something, and had {{something else to do}} afterwards; or he had just been somewhere, was <b>going</b> <b>somewhere</b> else, and had several other appointments to follow." [...] That year, Leno performed the role of [...] "waxi omo" [...] (a slang expression for a black-face performer) in the Doo-da-Day Minstrels, an act that included Danvers, Campbell, Bransby Williams, Joe Elvin and Eugene Stratton. [...] The troupe's only performance was at the London Pavilion on 29 May 1899 as part of a benefit. [...] Leno's song [...] "The Funny Little Nigger" [...] greatly amused the audience. His biographer Barry Anthony considered the performance to be [...] "more or less, the last gasp of black-face minstrelsy in Britain".|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of Glee second season, Lauren forms a {{relationship}} with local bad boy and football star Noah Puckerman. As the season progresses, Lauren and Puck's relationship continues to grow stronger. Their relationship begins to form in the ninth episode of the second season titled [...] "Special Education". After Puck attempts to recruit new members for the William McKinley High School glee club, members of the football team lock him in a port-a-potty. After being discovered by Lauren, he convinces her to join New Directions, despite her belief that show choir is stupid. Ashley Fink said of their relationship: [...] "I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we're all kind of along for the ride. I know what you mean, but I wouldn't count us out just yet on that front. We all have to laugh at ourselves but it's <b>going</b> <b>somewhere.</b> Ultimately, {{it comes down to}} whether audiences will buy a relationship between Puck and Lauren. I think there's a really hilarious chemistry between Puck and Lauren. I think he's a badass, she's a badass. I don't know, I think they're funny together. There's something about {{the two of them together}} that I like, so I hope it's not outside the realm of possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{he heard}} of Eisenhower's posture, Nixon's {{happiness}} {{at what he}} had finally been convinced was a [...] turned to fury, and he stated that if the speech did not satisfy the general, {{nothing he could do}} would. He called in his secretary, Rose Mary Woods, and dictated a telegram to the RNC resigning from the ticket. As Woods left the room with her notes, Chotiner stopped her, took the sheet, and ripped it up. While Chotiner understood Nixon's rage, he felt that the resignation was premature. The campaign manager urged Nixon simply to allow the public wave of support to pressure Eisenhower. He suggested that instead of going to Wheeling as Eisenhower had requested, that they resume the train tour in Missoula, Montana. Nixon sent Eisenhower a curt acknowledgment of his telegram, and a suggestion that they meet the following week in Washington, D.C. Chotiner then called Summerfield, telling him that Nixon felt he had been abused enough, and would not meet with Eisenhower until Summerfield was able to promise, on his word of honor, that the senator would be confirmed as nominee at that meeting.

There have been a couple of twists and turns after the Blake record, that's granted, but nothing too significant. I see Ulver as having a part one and a part two. And that's a division that we already had in our minds before those first three albums were even finished. We already knew we were <b>going</b> <b>somewhere</b> else after Nattens madrigal. Due to logistics, we had to wait almost two years until that one got released, and in the interim we had amassed a huge array of influences.

Perrine writes [...] "The 'you and I' of the first line are divided parts of Prufrock's own nature", while Mutlu Konuk Blasing suggests that the [...] "you and I" [...] refers {{to the relationship between}} the dilemmas of the character and the author. Similarly, critics dispute whether Prufrock is <b>going</b> <b>somewhere</b> {{during the course of the}} poem. In the first half of the poem, Prufrock uses various outdoor images (the sky, streets, cheap restaurants and hotels, fog), and talks about how there will be time for various things before [...] "the taking of a toast and tea", and [...] "time to turn back and descend the stair." [...] This has led many to believe that Prufrock is on his way to an afternoon tea, where he is preparing to ask this [...] "overwhelming question". Others, however, believe that Prufrock is not physically going anywhere, but rather, is playing through it in his mind.|$|E
