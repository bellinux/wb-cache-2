5|$|A {{number of}} reports had been {{received}} about poor quality aircraft {{received by the}} regiments which pointed <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the NII VVS as it was responsible for monitoring {{the quality of the}} aircraft delivered to the VVS. On 31 May 1941 the People's Commissariat of Defense decreed that the NII VVS had been negligent. A number of senior managers were demoted {{and the head of the}} Institute, Major General A. I. Filin was summarily executed.|$|E
5|$|Barlow {{immediately}} {{turned to}} investigate the strange sail, steering southwards <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the lumbering vessel. Saulnier was seemingly unwilling to attempt any manoeuvere {{in the face of}} the enemy, as Africaine continued to hold the original course without deviation. By 19:30 it was inevitable that Phoebe would intercept Africaine and Saulnier shortened sail, slowing his frigate to meet the threat. Barlow was still unsure of the identity of the stranger and fired a shot over Africaine as a warning to its captain to identify his ship. Saulnier responded by turning to port and firing a broadside <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> Phoebe. It was poorly aimed however and mostly scattered into the sea without effect. At this, Barlow pulled Phoebe into a parallel position to Africaine and unleashed a much more devastating broadside from close range. The two frigates then began an exchange of fire at close range.|$|E
5|$|Howe and Queen Charlotte led {{the fleet}} by example, sailing <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the French {{flagship}} Montagne. Passing between Montagne {{and the next}} in line Vengeur du Peuple, Queen Charlotte raked both and hauled up close to Montagne {{to engage in a}} close-range artillery battle. As she did so, Queen Charlotte also became briefly entangled with Jacobin, and exchanged fire with her too, causing serious damage to both French ships.|$|E

5|$|Pilots {{noted that}} in a crosswind, {{the nose of the}} plane would not point <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off, to {{compensate}} for the wind. Since making the beams bright enough at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to fly on the curving approach path which keeps the nose pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight-line path with the nose pointed upwind.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope, which {{cannot be}} pointed <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the Sun, used the Moon as {{a mirror to}} study the light that had passed through the {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{in order to determine}} its composition.

5|$|The {{brightness}} of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes. Looking <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the Sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness. UV exposure gradually yellows {{the lens of the}} eye over a period of years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts, but this depends on general exposure to solar UV, and not whether one looks <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the Sun. Long-duration viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused; conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high altitude.|$|E

5|$|The sensory {{nervous system}} is {{involved}} with the reception and processing of sensory information. This information is received through the cranial nerves, through tracts in the spinal cord, and <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> centres of the brain exposed to the blood. The brain also receives and interprets information from the special senses (vision, smell, hearing, and taste). Mixed motor and sensory signals are also integrated.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{scheme was}} introduced, {{using a combination}} of automatic signalling and modifications to the layout at Liverpool Street. The station introduced coaling, watering, and other maintenance facilities <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the station, as well as separate engine bays and a modified track and station layout that reduced turnaround times and increased productivity. Services began on 2 July 1920 with trains to Chingford and Enfield running every 10 minutes. The cost of the modifications was £80,000 compared to an estimated £3million for electrification. The service was officially called the Intensive Service (as it allowed a 50% increase in capacity on peak services), but became popularly known as the Jazz Service. It lasted until the General Strike of 1926, following which services generally declined.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal began brightly {{in front}} of a crowd of 65,483, {{creating}} the first chance of the match in the 17th minute. Paul Davis set up striker Kevin Campbell, who hooked the ball high over goal. Four minutes later, Alan Smith headed the ball into the goal net, meeting a cross from Paul Merson; it was ruled out by referee Terry Holbrook for offside. Tottenham improved shortly after, with Gary Mabbutt heading the ball <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman to create their first chance of the match. Their best opportunity to score was in the 36th minute. Vinny Samways set up Gary Lineker to break past the Arsenal defence. Having nudged the ball past Tony Adams, Lineker looked up, before making a cross for Nayim to head; the shot was acrobatically saved by Seaman's right foot.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona {{kicked the}} match off, but Manchester United showed their intent from the outset, forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further {{pressure}} on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré fouling Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's shooting range. Ronaldo fired the free kick <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but {{only as far as}} Wayne Rooney, whose snap-shot was wayward and went out for a goal kick.|$|E

5|$|In Star Wars: Jedi Arena, two Jedi Knights, one {{blue and}} one red, {{face each other}} during lightsaber training. Player one is blue; the red Jedi is either a human- or {{computer-controlled}} opponent. The player controls his or her lightsaber with the paddle controller, defending oneself from the laser blasts coming from the Seeker ball, fired by the opponent. The Seeker will regularly turn wild and fire laser blasts randomly. The objective {{of the game is}} to fire laser blasts from the Seeker at the opponent's shield and finally <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the opponent by aiming in the direction that the lightsaber is pointing. The game has four difficulty levels, changing the Seeker's speed; on the highest level, the Seeker is invisible. The game ends when one player has received three direct hits, and the winner becomes a Jedi Master.|$|E

For the first option to be successful, the North Vietnamese had to secure Highways 14, 19, and 21 to isolate Ban Me Thuot, and stop potential South Vietnamese reinforcements. The North Vietnamese favoured the first option, {{because it would}} give the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and other support units little or no time to respond. At the same time, the first option would have enabled a quick victory without inflicting large-scale damage on the civilian population of Ban Me Thuot.|$|E
5|$|Looking <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the {{photosphere}} of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), {{even for}} just a few seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.|$|E
5|$|Since looking <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the Sun {{can lead}} to {{permanent}} eye damage or blindness, special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is technically safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse {{with the unaided eye}} and without protection; however, this is a dangerous practice, as most people are not trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse, which can span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location. People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.|$|E
