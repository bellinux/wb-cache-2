He also considered that [...] "Describing an incident as racist may say as much about a victim's mindset as the offender. <b>How</b> <b>else</b> <b>can</b> one explain the British Crime Survey finding that 3,100 car thefts from Asians were deemed to be racially motivated?" [...] Yasmin Alibhai-Brown condemned the double standards of racial equality campaigners in relation to the case, suggesting black activists should [...] "march and remember victims like Ross Parker ... our values are worthless unless all victims of these senseless deaths matter equally". She went on to write that [...] "to treat some victims as more worthy of condemnation than others is unforgivable and a betrayal of anti-racism itself".|$|E

2500|$|Transferred to Supreme Army Command as Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster General {{at the end}} of April 1918, Thaer {{reported}} to Hindenburg and Ludendorff on 1 May 1918. [...] He had already resolved that he would report openly on the frontline situation to the two men running the war. [...] By that criterion he failed. [...] The field-marshall hero of Tannenberg was sympathetic: [...] "My dear Mr von Thaer, your nerves have certainly been affected by the last few terrible weeks through which you have come. [...] I think that the good spirits at Supreme Army Command will soon set you right". [...] Thaer encountered a similar, if less avuncular, reaction a little later when he {{reported to}} First Quartermaster General Erich von Ludendorff: [...] "What's your game? [...] What {{do you want me to}} do? [...] Should I now make peace at any price?" [...] Thaer replied: [...] "Excellence, I said nothing about that. [...] Ot is my duty - and it is a very painful duty - to point out that the condition of our troops is not going to improve, but will continue slowly to deteriorate". [...] Ludendorff persisted: [...] "If the condition of our troops is getting worse, if discipline is deteriorating, then that is your fault and the fault of all those field commanders who do not get it. [...] <b>How</b> <b>else</b> <b>can</b> it be that entire divisions can found too drunk to fight, unable to implement the necessary advances.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of chemotaxis {{is one of}} the most interesting issues in modern cell biology. Recent work shows that shallow chemoattractant gradients do not induce the generation of pseudopods, as has been predicted in many models. This poses the question of <b>how</b> <b>else</b> cells <b>can</b> steer towards chemoattractants. Here we use a new computational algorithm to analyze the extension of pseudopods by Dictyostelium cells. We show that a shallow gradient of cAMP induces a small bias in the direction of pseudopod extension, without significantly affecting parameters such as pseudopod frequency or size. Persistent movement, caused by alternating left/right splitting of existing pseudopodia, amplifies the effects of this bias by up to 5 -fold. Known players in chemotactic pathways play contrasting parts in this mechanism; PLA 2 and cGMP signal to the cytoskeleton to regulate the splitting process, while PI 3 -kinase and soluble guanylyl cyclase mediate the directional bias. The coordinated regulation of pseudopod generation, orientation and persistence by multiple signaling pathways allows eukaryotic cells to detect extremely shallow gradients. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main point}} of {{reference}} in this research paper is the author's declaration that he finds {{the question about the}} essence of the human being in toto nonsensical. This declaration - radical in its tone - may for the reader uninitiated into the works of O. F. Bollnow, an author of many anthropological and hermeneutic works and treatises - seem paradoxical at first. This declaration is inextricably linked with Bollnow's postulate that anthropological attempts at creating a closed and transparent image of man should be abandoned not only on account of cognitive difficulties, but also due to moral responsibility. This study is the evidence of the reflection on the reasons determining Bollnow's restrained attitude towards the possibilities for defining the human being in terms of essence. At the same time, it emphasises the cognitive results of the author's considerations on the consequences of the lack of the essence-wise defining of man in Bollnow's philosophical inquiries, and on <b>how</b> <b>else</b> one <b>can</b> pursue an "anthropological mode of deliberations" with a view to fruitful results and without slipping into the rut of traditional philosophical anthropology, which after all has many a time posed the issue of essence-wise determination of man. In his conception of the essence-wise openness of man, Bollnow resembles Helmuth Plessner's viewpoint on man as an open problem...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{motivation}} and trust-based {{management in the}} workplace. The financial incentive no longer seems {{to be enough to}} motivate people to work. This is why it is important to explore <b>how</b> <b>else</b> human motivation <b>can</b> be affected. Much research points to the importance of employee motivation in the context of achieving positive effects. The concept of trust is popular these days and used by more and more leaders. Trust-based management is also said to ensure positive results in the modern organization. Trust has become a so-called buzzword and will be claimed by many as somewhat overvalued and the concept may appear vague and imprecise. What lies in the concept of trust and can be used for anything in modern management? How do you create trust between management and employees? There are many questions and answers may be different. In this thesis, I will, in cooperation with the Danish company Aquaporin A / S examine the conditions that apply with respect to motivation and trust-based management in the modern enterprise...|$|R
