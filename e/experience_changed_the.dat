In 1600, with the style of 'admiral of the narrow seas,' he commanded a squadron sent towards the Azores to look outfor the Spanish treasure-ships.

Second, what lessons can be drawn regarding the monetary policy strategy that should {{be followed by a}} central bank? How activist should a central bank be in dampening macroeconomic fluctuations? Should the “output gap ” serve as an important policy guide? Are there lessons regarding the stability-oriented approach followed by the ECB? How activist should a central bank be in tackling perceived asset price misalignments? Does the ECB’s monetary analysis pillar help incorporate the pertinent information in formulating policy? Third, is monetary policy pursuing price stability enough to ensure overall stability in the economy? Or is there room for improvement regarding how central banks can contribute to financial stability? Should the role of monetary policy be seen as completely separate from the broader institutional environment governing financial markets and institutions in our economy? Or would greater central bank involvement in regulation and supervision pertaining to credit and finance allow better management of overall economic stability...|$|E

However, inconsistent perspectives exist concerning the impact of ethics education on students 2 ̆ 7 ethical awareness and moral reasoning. This phenomenological study examined the perceptions of senior-level undergraduate business students on their own ethical belief systems and changes in ethical awareness. Astin 2 ̆ 7 s student development theory on the environmental effects on learning formed the conceptual framework. The research questions explored how the 4 -year undergraduate business school <b>experience</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> students 2 ̆ 7 ability to recognize and evaluate ethical concerns {{in relation to the}} ethical aspects of coursework. Thirteen undergraduate seniors pursuing a business degree from a Catholic college were purposively selected. In-depth interviews were used to obtain data about ethical self-awareness, recognition of ethical issues, understanding ethical concepts, and assessing core values. The study followed Moustakas 2 ̆ 7 recommendation for phenomenological analysis, a modification of the Stevick-Colaizzi-Keen method. Emergent themes included the meaning of moral character development, the perception of the college business curriculum in relation to students 2 ̆ 7 core values, and the approaches used to affect ethical situations. The findings suggest that the business curriculum increase the students 2 ̆ 7 exposure to ethical situations and introduce decision tools that could be useful in ethical dilemmas. Recommendations involve considering a pretest and posttest design and Astin 2 ̆ 7 s entire inputs-environment-outcomes model as the theoretical framework.

40|$|This inquiry {{investigated}} four design educators’ {{perspectives and}} beliefs of global competence teaching and learning, and aimed to inform effective global competence curricula planning and instruction across disciplines. The literature uncovered multiple reasons to warrant design educator reflections: (a) similarities among global competence and design thinking characteristics, (b) design education accreditation emphasis on globally oriented standards, and (c) design thinking as a resource to improve practices across disciplines. Accordingly, the inquiry employed a qualitative design and a multiple case-study approach. Data collection methods included: (a) interviews, (b) image artifacts, and (c) researcher reflective memos. A comparative analysis used systematic coding to reveal core theme statements grounded in the data. The inquiry revealed all four design educators believed: (a) active learning and information gathering activities were effective ways to teach global competence, (b) interaction with others from different backgrounds contributed to global competence development, (c) a formal education <b>experience</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> ways they view the world and empathize with others, (d) the critique was an effective global competence teaching and learning tool, and (e) the role of perception processes fostered ability to recognize qualities of other people and places. All four design educators’ image artifacts represented meanings and interpretations of global competence as human-centered, and expressed physical connection. Ultimately, three overarching discoveries emerged: (a) design educators use mindshifts to develop global competence, (b) design educators are makers of their global competence development, and (c) design educators are mature motivators of global competence development. The inquiry concluded with a model for design education global competence development grounded in the data and the literature. Implications for action connected to three higher education teaching and learning areas: (a) mindfulness, (b) the maker movement, and (c) mindsets. Overall, the four design educators’ information-rich narratives and practical curricula design applications presented in this inquiry aim to encourage other educators to relate the global dimensions of their own disciplines to current teaching and research practice...|$|E
40|$|Adolescence is {{the period}} of {{physical}} and emotional development from childhood to adulthood. As an adolescent develops they struggle with many issues including developing independence from their parents, embracing peer culture, {{an increase in the}} importance of body image and the development of sexual, vocational, and moral identity. The diagnosis and treatment for cancer can interfere with the adolescent meeting these goals, and subsequently cause the experience of adolescence to be more difficult. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify how adolescents with cancer cope with their situation. The objectives were to determine the resources adolescents utilise to cope with their experience, and the coping strategies adolescents use to cope with their experience. A thorough literature review identified that there had previously been only limited research with adolescents with cancer. In particular there had been very few qualitative studies investigating the specific coping strategies used by adolescents with cancer, with no such research being undertaken in Queensland. This study was conducted under the epistemological stance of constructionism. Meaning was constructed for this study of adolescents with cancer through the use of grounded theory methods, and secondary analysis of data. Interviews were collected by the researcher for a project at the Royal Children 2 ̆ 7 s Hospital. Using grounded theory methods, seven of the interviews were analysed. In the process of developing a central category, Schatzman 2 ̆ 7 s Dimensional Matrix was used to assign codes into context, processes, consequences, and conditions, under the central category of 2 ̆ 7 conquering the cancer experience 2 ̆ 7. The experience of diagnosis and treatment for cancer was difficult for these adolescents, however they ultimately coped and became stronger as a result of their experience. The key findings of this study identified that adolescents were able to cope with their experience.;These finding were discussed in relation to factors which enhanced their coping, factors which influenced their ability to cope and how the <b>experience</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> adolescent. Recommendations were also made with the aim of improving the experience of adolescents undergoing treatment for cancer in Queensland. Through the implementation of the recommendations of this study, hopefully the journey of adolescents with cancer can be made easier...|$|E
