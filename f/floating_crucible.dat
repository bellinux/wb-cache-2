40|$|Homogeneous and graded n- and p-type (Bi 2 Te 3) 1 -x-y (Sb 2 Te 3) x (Sb 2 Se 3) y {{crystals}} {{are grown}} by the Czochralski technique with melt supply through a <b>floating</b> <b>crucible.</b> The dimensionless thermoelectric {{figure of merit}} of the n- and p-type crystals is ZT = 1. 1 (350 K) and 1. 0 (375 K), respectively. It is shown that (Bi 2 Te 3) 1 -x-y (Sb 2 Te 3) x (Sb 2 Se 3) y pseudoternary solid solutions {{can be used to}} produce monolithic n- and p- type graded and segmented thermoelectric materials by Czochralski growth. The thermoelectric power distribution across the seed-crystal interface is studied using scanning hot microprobe measurements...|$|E
40|$|The mixed layered (ML) tetradlmite-like compormds in the PbTe-BizTe: and PbTe-Sb 2 Te 3 quasi-binary {{systems have}} been hvestigated by X-ray {{diffraction}} study (XRD) of single crystals and by measurement of their thermoelectric (TE) properties. The ingots with directional structure were grown by vertical version of Bridgman {{as well as by}} Czochralski technique with supply of the melt from a <b>floating</b> <b>crucible.</b> The atomic coordinates, the equivalent positions, site occupancy and interatomic distances in the PbBiaTeT and PbSbzTe 4 structures have been determined by an automatic four-circle XRD S),ntex Pl diffractometer (MoKa-radiation). The PbTe-SbzTe: phase diagram was refrned. Two compounds (PbSbzTer, PbSbrTer) have been discovered in this system. The existence of the Pb 2 sb 6 Terl compound described earlier in Ret [1] was not confirmed in the present work. The ML compounds are characterized by low lattice thermal conductivity which is significantly lower than that for Bi 2 Te 3 -based alloys. Further decreasing lattice thermal conductivity is reached by preparing the alloys of PbBia(Tel-. Se) 7 (03 < 0. 20) solid solutions with isovalent anion substitution...|$|E
40|$|Attempts {{were made}} to grow alloy {{crystals}} of Ga{sub 1 {minus}x}In{sub x}Sb by the conventional Czochralski process. A transparent furnace was used, with hydrogen purging through the chamber during crystal growth. Single crystal seeds up to about 2 to 5 mole% InSb were grown from seeds of 1 to 2 mole% InSb, which were grown from essentially pure GaSb seeds of the [111] direction. Single crystals were grown with InSb rising from about 2 to 6 mole% at the seed ends to about 14 to 23 mole% InSb at the finish ends. A floating-crucible technique that had been effective in reducing segregation in doped crystals, was used to reduce segregation in Czochralski growth of alloy crystals of Ga{sub 1 {minus}x}In{sub x}Sb. Crystals close to the targeted composition of 1 mole% InSb were grown. However, difficulties were encountered in reaching higher targeted InSb concentrations. Crystals about 2 mole% were grown when 4 mole% was targeted. It was observed that mixing occurred between the melts rendering the compositions of the melts; and, hence, the resultant crystal unpredictable. The higher density of the growth melt {{than that of the}} replenishing melt could have triggered thermosolutal convection to cause such mixing. It was also observed that the <b>floating</b> <b>crucible</b> stuck to the outer crucible when the liquidus temperature of the replenishing melt was significantly higher than that of the growth melt. The homogeneous Ga{sub 1 {minus}x}In{sub x}Sb single crystals were grown successfully by a pressure-differential technique. By separating a quartz tube into an upper chamber for crystal growth and a lower chamber for replenishing. The melts were connected by a capillary tube to suppress mixing between them. A constant pressure differential was maintained between the chambers to keep the growth melt up in the growth chamber. The method was first tested with a low temperature alloy Bi{sub 1 {minus}x}Sb{sub x}. Single crystals of Ga{sub 1 {minus}x}In{sub x}Sb were grown with uniform compositions up to nearly 5 mole% InSb...|$|E
