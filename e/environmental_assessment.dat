40|$|To help {{decision-makers}} {{cope with}} the uncertainty of global environmental change, transnational networks of experts have offered numerous assessments {{of the state of}} knowledge, often advertised as consensus of ‘‘international science’’. Substantial social science research has already analysed the effects of such global <b>environmental</b> <b>assessments</b> on industrialized countries; this study explores their influence in India as a pivotal developing country. It appears that although global <b>environmental</b> <b>assessments</b> did not remain without any influence in India, their effect is still small. These limitations could be addressed, it is argued, by increasing the usefulness and legitimacy of global <b>environmental</b> <b>assessments</b> in the South through stronger consideration of the socio-economic context of developing countries and other Southern concerns and interests, by raising the participation of Southern experts, by enhancing research capacities in and communication links to the South, and by ensuring that global <b>environmental</b> <b>assessments</b> are organized as self-adaptive processes, such as IPCC, and not as one-shot effort, such as the Global Biodiversity Assessment. r 200...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this diploma thesis, called <b>Environmental</b> impact <b>assessment</b> (EIA) in {{european}} law, is to explain the procedure of <b>environmental</b> impact <b>assessment.</b> Emphasis of this diploma thesis is placed on legislation dealing with the <b>environmental</b> impact <b>assessment</b> and its development. The diploma thesis is divided into five chapters, further it contains the introduction, the conclusion, the list of abbreviation, the list of pictures, attachement and the list of literature. Chapter one defines the <b>environmental</b> impact <b>assessment</b> itself and distinguishes the project (EIA) and strategic (SEA) assessment. Chapter two describes the international law concerning the <b>environmental</b> impact <b>assessment.</b> The {{most important part of}} this diploma thesis is chapter three, which contains the analysis of european and czech legislation regarding to the <b>environmental</b> impact <b>assessment.</b> The czech legislation is then compared to legislation of other member states of the EU. Chapter four characterizes the procedure of <b>environmental</b> impact <b>assessment</b> within the Natura 2000. Chapter five analyses the case Temelín with respect to <b>environmental</b> impact <b>assessment...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{section of}} Highway404 north of Stouffville Road {{was the subject}} of {{considerable}} controversy when work began to clear the route on 15 May 1981 before the completion of an environmental impact assessment.

5|$|Expansion of US 113 to {{a divided}} highway slowed in the 1970s. As with most major highway projects, the divided highway {{expansion}} projects received partial federal funding, and starting in 1970, those federally aided projects required {{environmental impact assessment}} under the National Environmental Policy Act. This new barrier slowed {{the completion of the}} divided highway between Milford to Dover. Maryland was subject to the same <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment,</b> but it was local activism that overcame state inaction in continuing divided highway construction along US 113 in that state.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{recession}} of the mid-1990s resulted in Highway 407 being truncated in Markham temporarily. Slightly revised plans for the links appeared on the June 2007 Technically Recommended Route Report for the extension of Highway407 to Highway35/115, which was submitted {{as part of the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> (EA) for the extension, but had been announced earlier that year on March7 by the Government of Canada, as part of an investment in Greater Toronto Area infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the MTO {{began an}} <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> {{into a new}} {{alignment}} for the northern connection with the Queensway. It was approved in mid-1987, with Cedarview Drive chosen as the ideal alignment for the new freeway. The MTO set out to design a four-lane route to connect the Queensway with Highway16 New, including a three-level free-flow interchange. A contract for construction of this interchange was awarded in late 1989 and construction began in 1990. During the 1991 construction season, contracts were awarded to construct several overpasses along the new route.|$|E

5|$|Site {{construction}} of the facility began on 1 June 2005 following environmental approval from the Canadian <b>Environmental</b> <b>Assessment</b> Act.

During its peak of construction activities {{in the summer of}} 2006, more than 500 workers were involved both at the Sliding Centre and at the Whistler Nordic Venue (now Whistler Olympic Park). A core group of 60 workers was involved with track construction from June 2005 to December 2007. Basic track construction was completed in November 2007 though fit-out and testing continued into 2008.|$|E

The Federal Highway Administration approved the Ellendale Area <b>Environmental</b> <b>Assessment</b> with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2010. DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 on its present alignment through the study area, which runs from south of Redden Road to north of DE 16. Along much of the route, service roads would be constructed parallel to the present highway {{to provide access to}} properties along US 113 and to connect with the local road system and reduce the number of contact points with US 113. Interchanges are planned at Redden Road and DE 16.|$|E
5|$|It {{would take}} until 1982 before serious {{consideration}} {{was given to}} any expressway plan. While most of the planned 1963 routes had vanished from the drawing board, a north–south link through the Red Hill Valley Creek and an east–west route along the brow of the escarpment remained in place. An <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> of both links began and was approved in 1985. However, expressway opponents launched {{an appeal to the}} provincial cabinet. This appeal was rejected in 1987, and engineering began. Preliminary designs were submitted to the Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth and approved in April 1990. Construction began immediately on structures to carry three routes (two road and one rail) over the future Red Hill Valley Parkway.|$|E

5|$|The issues {{regarding}} {{the development of}} the park's coastline remain open. The Master Plan of Tsarevo Municipality adopted in 2008 and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Water envisages the construction of vacation complexes with 75,000 beds on the territory of the park and Natura 2000 network. As a result, the European Commission launched an infringement procedure against Bulgaria that forced the Ministry to withdraw the positive <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> of the Master Plan in 2010 but the decision was rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court. The Strandzha Nature Park Management Plan drafted in 2003 has not yet meet with approval by the Ministry of Environment and Water.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the White Paper, the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow ('Project Heathrow' for short) was set up to examine how expansion at Heathrow could best be accomplished within the constraints of the stringent environmental limits the White Paper required. A provisional assessment indicates that increased usage of the existing runways could be realised without increasing the number of people affected by noise if 'mixed mode' operations (the simultaneous use of both runways for arrivals and departures) are phased in gradually as noisier aircraft are retired. Indications ahead of the Project Heathrow <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> indicate that increased noise and deterioration in air quality are likely to significantly constrain traffic using a new third runway. These issues are to be addressed as part of a three-month consultation beginning in December 2007, and considerable opposition is being mobilised against the expansion of Heathrow.|$|E
