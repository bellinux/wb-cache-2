5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. <b>I</b> <b>finished.</b> Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
25|$|The Principles of Mathematics, which <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> on 23 May 1902, {{turned out}} to be a crude and rather {{immature}} draft of the subsequent work , from which, however, it differed in containing controversy with other philosophies of mathematics.|$|E
25|$|I didn't {{play that}} well in {{stages of the}} tour and other players {{deserved}} a game. But we got to halfway through the tour and (captain) Greg Chappell {{came to me and}} said there was trouble at the top of the order and asked if I would like to open the batting in the county games. I did that and I was quite successful. I think at the end of the tour <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> about fifth in the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference. I was the only one who didn't play a Test match.|$|E

25|$|I {{knew that}} the end of September was the last period (of time) before the explosion, but when Sharon reached the al-Aqsa Mosque, this was the most {{appropriate}} moment for the outbreak of the intifada.... The night prior to Sharon's visit, I participated in a panel on a local television station and I seized the opportunity to call on the public to go to the al-Aqsa Mosque in the morning, for it was not possible that Sharon would reach al-Haram al-Sharif just so, and walk away peacefully. <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> and went to al-Aqsa in the morning.... We tried to create clashes without success because of the differences of opinion that emerged with others in the al-Aqsa compound at the time.... After Sharon left, I remained for two hours in the presence of other people, we discussed the manner of response and how it was possible to react in all the cities (bilad) and not just in Jerusalem. We contacted all (the Palestinian) factions.|$|E
500|$|After {{revealing}} that {{the song was}} finished, Mr. Bangladesh stated {{that he wanted to}} wait until the right artist came along to record the song. He later decided that it would be Rihanna, saying, [...] "I was like, 'That's dope. That's Rihanna all day'. They sent the song back, and <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> producing it. I put the 'I love it' on it that they had already had... She loved it, and that's what it was." ...|$|E

500|$|I did Winnie Winkle for 20 years, {{and when}} they told me, [...] "You have 90 days to wrap it up," [...] because they were discontinuing it, I felt terrible, but after <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> it, I didn't even miss it. I was {{depressed}} because I lost a good job, but I just didn't miss it. Maybe it was the routine of it every week I didn't miss, but I {{have a lot of}} good memories of doing that strip.|$|E
500|$|When you win a race {{like this}} {{the feeling is}} very, very good. There {{have been times when}} I have been {{flat-out}} to finish sixth, but you can't see that from the outside.

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers in both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Although Bird spoke of his satisfaction of controlling {{the pace of the}} feature race, he believed he was fortunate because of him receiving a new rear wing after being impacted by Ceccon at the first start, [...] "It’s an amazing to be able to win my first GP2 race in Monaco. Maybe I should have done it already in the past in GP2, but it felt pretty right today." [...] Ceccon stated he was [...] "happy" [...] to secure second place and praised his team for his strategy that enabled him to move ahead of Evans, [...] " [...] It’s my first GP2 podium and it’s {{two years in a row}} that I finish on the podium here since <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> third last year in GP3 here as well. Today, <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> in P2 in race 1. It’s good." [...] When asked if he was disappointed over his third place finish, Evans replied yes as he struggled with grip on his supersoft compound tyres at the restart and was being pressured by Bird on the harder soft compound tyres. Evans believed that had he overtaken Ceccon he could have had similar pace levels to Bird and felt the best possible result he could have achieved was second but stated he would accept the result.|$|E

I hope <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> [...] I don't know. We left him on the cabin floor of the radio room, and he was not moving." [...] The two radio operators went in opposite directions, Phillips aft and Bride forward towards collapsible lifeboat B.|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Trent Reznor expressed his intentions to write {{material for a}} new release while on tour promoting With Teeth. He reportedly began work on the new album by September 2006. Reznor devised much of the album's musical direction on his laptop. Reznor told Kerrang! in a later interview, [...] "When I was on the [...] tour, to keep myself busy I just really hunkered down and was working on music the whole time, so this kept me in a creative mode and when <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> the tour I felt like I wasn't tired and wanted to keep at it." ...|$|E

He issued a statement describing the demanding mixing process which took place at his New York Studio: [...] "It's OK — some places it rocks hard, and others are a bit sloppy, but I'm sure they won't use the whole concert. It was tough to mix." [...] The following day Shirley apologized for his [...] "unprofessional comment" [...] towards the band, and altered his post on his personal website to read: [...] "The rest of the week <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> mixing a live Slayer set for a DVD, in stereo and surround, and it's great — it rocks hard, but it was tough to mix." ...|$|E

The first said I was dead; the second said I was dying; and the third said I was about to die." [...] He also had problems having his Pleyel piano sent to him. It finally arrived from Paris in December. Chopin wrote to Pleyel in January 1839: [...] "I am sending you my Preludes [...] <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> them on your little piano, which arrived {{in the best possible}} condition in spite of the sea, the bad weather and the Palma customs." [...] Chopin was also able to undertake work on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.|$|E
500|$|S Chatterjee of NDTV, {{gave the}} film 3/5 stars and {{maintained}} that the film's philosophy is quite old and praised Zoya Akhtar's direction, stating [...] "Zoya Akhtar, by investing the tale with a delightful lightness of touch and dollops of gentle wit, brings a degree of freshness to bear upon the plot." [...] Shaikh Ayaz of Rediff rated the film 3.5/5 stars and felt that Zoya Akhtar had put together a familiar plot but the film's fresh energy is entertaining. He wrote, [...] "Akhtar's invigorating characters pump in fresh energy into a film {{that could have been}} strictly mediocre". Kaveree Bamzai of India Today, too was full of praise for Akhtar's direction and said [...] "By the time <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> watching Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara I was convinced that no one can make a romance as beautifully as a woman", giving the film 4 stars.|$|E
500|$|In Sherrybaby, Gyllenhaal {{played a}} young drug-addicted thief {{trying to put}} her life in order after prison so she can {{reconcile}} with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: [...] "I think she's in such dire straights [...] that all she has are these kind of naive, fierce hope. And while I was playing the part I was looking for pleasure and hope in everything, even in these really bleak things. And {{so it was really}} mostly after <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> the movie that I felt pain." [...] Her performance in the film was well received: David Germain of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly... that Sherry elicits sympathy even in her darkest and weakest moments", and Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance [...] "naturalistic". For her work, Gyllenhaal earned her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and won the Best Actress category award at the 2006 Stockholm International Film Festival.|$|E

500|$|Le Guin {{described}} {{coming of}} age as the main theme of the book, and wrote in a 1973 essay that she chose that theme since she was writing for an adolescent audience. She stated that [...] "Coming of age... {{is a process that}} took me many years; <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> it, so far as I ever will, at about age thirty-one; and so I feel rather deeply about it. So do most adolescents. It's their main occupation, in fact." [...] She also said that fantasy was best suited as a medium for describing {{coming of age}}, because exploring the subconscious was difficult using the language of [...] "rational daily life". The coming of age that Le Guin focused on included not just psychological development, but moral changes as well. Ged needs to recognize the balance between his power and his responsibility to use it well, a recognition which comes as he travels to the stone of Terrenon and sees the temptation that that power represents.|$|E
500|$|On September 24, West {{announced}} that he had finished the album and would be releasing it sometime in November. In his blog post, he wrote [...] "I changed my album to November something cause <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> the album and I felt like it..I want y'all to hear it as soon as possible". West later stated that the album would be released on November 25, 2008. However, Island Def Jam, the distributing label, brought the date forward by one day to capitalize on Thanksgiving weekend. 808s & Heartbreak was also released on November 24, 2008 in the United Kingdom and the Philippines. A limited edition in a digipak case was first released in Germany on November 21, 2008. A special edition of the album was released on December 16 that contains the album in CD and dual LP format, and also features album artwork redone by the artist of the original cover, Kaws.|$|E
500|$|Story editor Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I love 'Paper Clip'. I {{was thrilled}} with the plot. I know it moved very fast for some people, but I {{actually}} think that {{for some of these}} shows you don't need to understand everything. I think it is more exciting to go at rocket speed. Everybody was on the mark in that one; David and Gillian's performances, Rob Bowman's direction, Chris Carter's writing—everything was just terrific in that show". Bowman said [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> 'Paper Clip', I thought, 'I don't know what else I am going to do this year to top this'" [...] In 1996 Mitch Pileggi called the episode one of the show's finest, particularly enjoying the line where he tells The Smoking Man to [...] "pucker up and kiss my ass". Pileggi claims that is one of his favorite lines. The scene was used frequently to introduce him at X-Files conventions.|$|E
