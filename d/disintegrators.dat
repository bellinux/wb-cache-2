But, as it is true, how did the late Athenian drudge of Pisistratus succeed where Lönnrot failed? [...] "In the dovetailing of the ODYSSEY we see the work of one mind," [...] says Sir Richard. [Footnote: Homer, p. 129.] This mind cannot have been the property of any one but a great poet, obviously, as the Odyssey is confessedly [...] "an artistic whole." [...] Consequently the <b>disintegrators</b> of the Odyssey, when they are logical, are reduced to averring that the poem is an exceedingly inartistic whole, a whole not artistic at all. While Mr. Leaf calls it [...] "a model of skilful construction," [...] Wilamowitz Mollendorff denounces it {{as the work of}} [...] "a slenderly-gifted botcher," [...] of about 650 B.C., a century previous to Mr. Leaf's Athenian editor.|$|E

5000|$|For the 1953 film version, the Martians use a {{combination}} of three rays: one on top of their machines, which fire red sparks, and two disintegrator rays at the side, which are shown as green bolts. These two can only be pointed in the direction the ship is facing, while the one at the top can be pointed in any direction. Most of their targets would glow and vanish, sometimes leaving a stain or pile of ash; the Heat-Ray differs from the <b>disintegrators</b> (also called [...] "skeleton beam") as the former sets the surrounding environment ablaze as well as vaporizing the target within a few seconds. Although the Heat-Ray does have a simple destructive effect on certain objects, at other times, the ray would set objects ablaze or cause them to explode (as shown when the machines reach Los Angeles). In one scene, General Mann states that it is likely the Martians generate radiation without using heavy screening to power their rays. The book's Black smoke is replaced by the [...] "skeleton beam".

40|$|Ultrasound-induced {{acoustic}} cavitation {{has been}} studied in detail due to its chemical effects (sonochemistry) and light emission (sonoluminescence). However, the physical effects such as shear, shockwaves, etc., {{can also be used}} for useful applications despite their harmful effects, such as cavitation erosion. It has been suggested that the physical forces generated during cavitation may alter the 3 -dimensional network of water molecules and hence a better hydration of macromolecules can be achieved using the cavitation process. In recent times, the physical effects of acoustic cavitation are used in food processing applications. The possibility of using hydrodynamic cavitation for food processing as an alternative approach to ultrasonic processing has been discussed in this manuscript. A special rotary disintegrator, developed by Dr. Hint in the last century is used for the generation of efficient hydrodynamic cavitation. A mathematical model has been developed for the optimization of rotary <b>disintegrators.</b> The suitability of the model for evaluating the process efficiency has also been tested using experimental data obtained for the production of emulsions used as fuels. The development and testing of a new mathematical model for optimizing rotary <b>disintegrators</b> pave new pathways to the use of hydrodynamic cavitation for processing large volumes of liquid ingredients making them suitable for fuel and food industries. </p...|$|E

40|$|Aim of this {{research}} work was to develop mouth dissolve tablet that disintegrates rapidly in mouth and formulate tasteless complex of drug Cefixime. Cefixime is an oral third generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It is used to treat gonorrhea, tonsillitis, and pharyngitis. The tablets were prepared using different concentration of disintegrant by direct compression method. The superdisintegrants {{used in this study}} were Sodium starch glycolate (SSG), cropovidone (CP), Cross‐carmillose sodium (CCS) and Kyron T 314. The formulated tablets were evaluated for uniformity of weight, thickness, hardness, friability, wetting time, water absorption ratio, disintegration time (DT) and dissolution study. The conventional tablets of Cefixime were prepared by using the same excipients,without addition of Super fast tablet <b>disintegrators</b> and were evaluated in the similar way. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that the tablet formulation (batch FDT 5) showed Disintegration time of 30 ± 2. 4 seconds in vitro.

40|$|Background and objectives: The {{importance}} of Nitric oxide (NO) andAsymmetric dimethylargininie (ADMA) in pathophysiology of Sickle celldisease (SCD) is being increasingly clarified. Since {{very few of}} the studieshave been conducted in the word and no study has been carried out in Iran,especially in Khuzestan province where is the main center of Sickle Celldisorder (SCD) in Iran, We decided to conduct the present study. Material and Methods: EDTA anticoagulated plasma samples were obtainedfrom 35 healthy controls (Hb AA), 35 heterozygous (HB AS) and 35 homozygous (HB SS) sickle cell anemia patients. Plasma concentration of NOwas measured by Colorimetric and Griess reaction and the concentration ofADMA by employing ELISA method. Then the results were analyzed by tstudenttest and OneWay ANOVA. Results: There is a positive significance correlation between Hemoglobin(Hb) and NO in SS (r= 0. 703) and AS (r= 0. 366) groups. Also, a negativecorrelation between Hb and ADMA in SS (r=- 0. 786) and AS (r=- 0. 478) groups is seen. No correlation is found between these parameters in AAgroup. Conclusion: The prevention of Hb concentration decrease and prescription ofNO donors and (or) ADMA <b>disintegrators</b> can be helpful for improvingclinical signs of sickle cell patients.

40|$|Excess sludge {{treatment}} and disposal {{is currently a}} major challenge in wastewater treatment plants due to associated high costs and environmental regulation factors. Sludge disintegration technology (e. g., ultrasonic sludge <b>disintegrators),</b> {{can result in a}} significant reduction of the excess sludge produced in both municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants when integrated as a solubilisation step in the sludge recycle of the activated sludge plant. For modelling the process of ultrasonic sludge disintegration, knowledge about the release of soluble COD (sCOD) and soluble Kjeldahl nitrogen (sKN) {{as a function of the}} applied specific ultrasonic energy (ES, kJ/kg DS) provides insufficient information to result in a successful sludge disintegration model that is consistent with existing IWA Activated Sludge Models (ASM). In the research proposed in this paper, it was shown that respirometric data can be used to characterize the different COD fractions that are released and converted during the ultrasonic treatment of waste activated sludge. From the experiments it was concluded that the ultrasonically released COD in the supernatant liquid consists for approximately 70 % of slowly biodegradable COD (XS), mainly in the form of colloidal particulate material, 20 % of readily biodegradable COD (SS), and a remaining part of inert soluble COD (Si). Based on the performed COD fractionation experiments, also a saturation-based solubilisation model was proposed that is compatible with existing ASMs and that describes the ultrasonic sludge disintegration as a function of the specific energy (ES). status: publishe...|$|E
