The trade-offs between business demands, the level of community assets and {{the preferences of}} local citizens must be incorporated {{in order to develop}} an effective local <b>industrial</b> <b>targeting</b> program. The Community Business Matching (CBM) model provides a framework for obtaining the preferences of local citizens regarding economic development, identifying available local resources and quantifying the demands of businesses for these resources. The CBM model, therefore, yields information for targeted economic development such that industries that have needs compatible with local resources can be evaluated across parameters that local residents find desirable. As a result, communities can target businesses that provide the best match with their preferences. Alternatively communities can use the results of the CBM process to prioritize the development of assets that will be valued by businesses they would like to attract. The CBM model was applied to Anaconda, Montana, an EPA Super Fund Site. Results of the CBM process yielded information specific to potential industry targets for Anaconda. It provided impetus for Anaconda to pool resources to assist in the expansion of the local construction industry and insights to develop a regional approach to economic development with neighboring Butte-Silverbow County...|$|E

In analyzing these questions, Richard Baldwin, David Audretsch, Wolfgang Hager, and the active participation of the discussants have offered valuable insights based upon three distinct approaches illustrative of the dimensionality involved in giving definitive answers to the questions posed by Heinz Hauser.

40|$|The {{literature}} on clustering has highlighted several advantages of industrial agglomerations.

Persons and firms {{benefit from the}} production and innovation activities of neighbouring companies in the same and related industries. Considering such benefits, Michael Porter states that clustering is an important way for firms fulfilling their competitive advantages and for rising regional and national competitiveness. This justification has increasingly driven regional policy towards the cluster promotion. However, the cluster-support policy {{is in the middle}} of a controversy, since the traditional optimal-policy perspective recommends providing a subsidy to firms of clusters generating externalities, while Porter’s prescriptions recommend not choosing among clusters. So, we state that cluster policy is involved in a paradox: policy makers use the competitiveness rhetoric inspired in the competitive advantages of Porter but, in practice, they go on using the <b>industrial</b> <b>targeting</b> that was also criticized b Porter. This paper deals with this paradox presenting a model, which proves that despite the extensive amount of externalities is the traditional comparative advantage approach that must guide policy. This finding is congruent with the Porter’s policy prescriptions and has clear implications in regional policy. clusters, dynamic and static externalities, knowledge spillovers, regional economic development, spatial agglomeration...|$|E
40|$|Management summary Cities {{consist of}} various areas, prospering areas but also {{areas that are}} in distress. The current Dutch {{approach}} is to improve these distressed areas {{by focusing on the}} aspirations of the people living in these areas. It is believed people wish to advance in life {{and get out of the}} negative spiral of decline. To get out of the negative spiral of decline they have to start climbing the social ladder. This can be via different routes. The work route is one of these. The “Ik zit op Zuid ” project thought the midtech sector might provide opportunities for the young inhabitants of Rotterdam- South to start climbing the social ladder via the work route. Local economic development projects try to improve these distressed areas and aim to get people on the work route. Many local economic development projects aim at changing the skills of the inhabitants by focusing on the supply side of the labor market. This often results in an oversupply in the labor market.

Occupational- <b>industrial</b> <b>targeting</b> is however another demand side approach which can target more specifically for an area.

40|$|As a fact, China is now {{losing its}} {{competitiveness}} {{in the global}} industrial chain as the labor and land cost are increasing while the its industrial structure remains backward. Thus, big efforts {{will need to be}} made for China to upgrade within global value chains so as to achieve a sustainable growth in the near future. According to the latest National 12 th Five-Year Plan (from 2011 to 2015), it is urgent to tackle this problem by “Transformation and upgrading, enhancing the competitiveness of Industrial core”, and “Foster and develop strategic emerging sectors”. Chongqing is one of the four ventral government direct-controlled cities in China, which was created in 1997 and significant change has been made since that time. From 1997 to 2010, the annual average growth rate of GDP in Chongqing is more than 10 % and the annual average growth rate of fixed assets is more than 20 %. Given the background of the new round of national industrial reconstructing and the critical role the city plays, it is essential to do an <b>industrial</b> <b>targeting</b> in Chongqing. In this paper, I used several indicators to identify (1) the local industrial and innovation strength and (2) the local knowledge infrastructure so as to find the high-technology industrial clusters and sectors that with greatest potential to develop in the future.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to suggest how {{institutions}} can be created and modified to devise and implement industrial policy in the emerging market economies. Two main issues confronting industrial policy institutions are how to avoid regulatory capture, that is, having those policy-makers with a mandate to devise and implement industrial policy avoid being captured by particular interest groups; and how to make industrial policy consistent with international trade policy. The second section of this paper links institutions devising and implementing industrial and trade policies to the framework and timetable recently agreed upon in the Europe Agreements. The third section of the paper provides a framework for prescribing industrial policies, their interaction with trade policies, and institutions charged with policy formulation and implementation. At the heart of this framework is a clear distinction between sectoral policies, which essentially target the economic output of specific industries and even firms, and horizontal policies, which essentially focus on improving the quality of inputs in the production process. There are a number of reasons why industrial policy institutions of this second type are less likely to be subject to regulatory capture than industrial policy institutions of the first type. Regulatory capture is more likely to result when the benefits of industrial policy are concentrated upon a relatively few number of firms, as is the case of <b>industrial</b> <b>targeting.</b> By contrast, regulatory capture is less of a problem when the recipients tend to be more widely dispersed, as in the case of horizontal policies. Designing institutions of industrial policy and international trade to avoid, or at least to minimize regulatory capture is the subject of the fourth section. A number of administrative procedures which will serve to diminish the influence of political rent-seeking activities are introduced.

In this paper we deal with this paradox proving that despite the extensive amount of externalities is the traditional comparative advantage approach that must guide policy. This finding is congruent with the Porter’s policy prescriptions and has clear implications in regional policy allowing to support the answer to the following question: Must policy be focused on creation of new clusters in activities that have verified large positive effects elsewhere or, conversely, on developing the traditional activities in region, which allegedly have shown lower externalities? But {{the answer to this question}} depends on our comprehension of industrial aggregation processes, which implies the full understanding of concepts as clusters and externalities. So, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. After reflecting on the concept of cluster in section 2, section 3 deals with the different type of externalities present in industrial agglomerations. Section 4 considers the existence of dynamic externalities and relates them with the advantages of backwardness. Section 5 uses a model that includes various types of externalities in order to draw lessons for guiding clustering policy. Finally, section 6 concludes. ...|$|E
