5000|$|Reviewing the miniseries, {{the book}} [...] The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy claimed Legend of Earthsea [...] "totally missed the point" [...] of Le Guin's novels, [...] "ripping {{out all the}} subtlety, nuance and beauty of the books and <b>inserting</b> <b>boring</b> cliches, painful {{stereotypes}} and a very unwelcome 'epic' war in their place". The Moria website's review of [...] "Legend of Earthsea" [...] states [...] "Earthsea feels exactly like tv filler. In the books, Ursula Le Guin expended {{a great deal of}} time creating a world with a depth and culture, but nothing of this survives in the mini-series". The review also argues Legend of Earthsea [...] "is shabbily and indifferently directed" [...] and [...] "The dialogue is dreadfully clunky and often excruciatingly bad".|$|R
500|$|Two screen {{adaptations of}} the story have also been produced. An {{original}} mini-series titled Legend of Earthsea was broadcast in 2005 on the Sci Fi Channel. It is based very loosely on A Wizard of Earthsea and The Tombs of Atuan. In {{an article published in}} Salon, Le Guin expressed strong displeasure at the result. She stated that by casting a [...] "petulant white kid" [...] as Ged (who has red-brown skin in the book) the series [...] "whitewashed Earthsea", and had ignored her choice to write the story of a non-white character, a choice she said was central to the book. This sentiment was shared by a review in The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy, which said that Legend of Earthsea [...] "totally missed the point" [...] of Le Guin's novels, [...] "ripping out all the subtlety, nuance and beauty of the books and <b>inserting</b> <b>boring</b> cliches, painful stereotypes and a very unwelcome 'epic' war in their place".|$|R

50|$|The base is {{made from}} two blocks of iron, with a round cavity bored through the centre. The halves are joined {{together}} with a non-ferrous material such as brass or aluminium. A round permanent magnet is <b>inserted</b> into the <b>bored</b> hole and a handle is attached to allow easy rotation of the magnet. This act of rotation changes {{the position of the}} magnetic field so that poles are in the two iron halves, where the iron blocks act as keepers (on position), or completely in the non-ferrous core (off position).In this on position the field is effectively passing across an air gap (at the base and top). If this gap is bridged with another piece of iron (or steel in our case) it becomes part of the magnetic field's circuit and will be attracted with the full strength of the magnet.|$|R
50|$|Small-hole gauges {{require a}} {{slightly}} different technique to the telescopic gauges, the small hole gauge is initially set smaller than the bore to be measured. It is then <b>inserted</b> into the <b>bore</b> and adjusted by rotating the knurled knob at the base, until light pressure is felt when the gauge is slightly moved in the bore. The gauge is then removed and measured with a caliper or micrometer. To accurately detect the maximal distance between {{the two halves of}} the gauge head, move the head of the gauge around while making the measurement to insure you get the maximal reading. Grasp the gauge near the head to aid in your maneuvering of the gauge while adjusting the micrometer so it just stops the gauge's motion at one spot only. A bit of practice will quickly give you the idea.|$|R

[...] The banks of the cutting were so unstable that even during this opening-out work, timber horseshoe shoring was required.|$|R
50|$|Coiled elements: {{have largely}} {{replaced}} wire-wound elements in industry. This design has a wire coil that can expand freely over temperature, {{held in place}} by some mechanical support, which lets the coil keep its shape. This “strain free” design allows the sensing wire to expand and contract free of influence from other materials; in this respect it is similar to the SPRT, the primary standard upon which ITS-90 is based, while providing the durability necessary for industrial use. The basis of the sensing element is a small coil of platinum sensing wire. This coil resembles a filament in an incandescent light bulb. The housing or mandrel is a hard fired ceramic oxide tube with equally spaced bores that run transverse to the axes. The coil is <b>inserted</b> in the <b>bores</b> of the mandrel and then packed with a very finely ground ceramic powder. This permits the sensing wire to move, while still remaining in good thermal contact with the process. These elements work with temperatures to 850 °C.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to perform high-sensitivity NMR imaging and spectroscopic analysis on microfluidic devices. The application of NMR, the most information rich spectroscopic technique, to microfluidic devices remains a challenge because the inherently low sensitivity of NMR is aggravated by small fluid volumes leading to low NMR signal, and geometric constraints resulting in poor efficiency for inductive detection. We address the latter by physically separating signal detection from encoding of information with remote detection. Thereby, we use a commercial imaging probe with sufficiently large diameter to encompass the entire device, enabling encoding of NMR information at any location on the chip. Because large-diameter coils are too insensitive for detection, we store the encoded information as longitudinal magnetization and flow it into the outlet capillary. There, we detect the signal with optimal sensitivity using a solenoidal microcoil, and reconstruct the information encoded in the fluid. We present a generally applicable design for a detection-only microcoil probe that can be <b>inserted</b> into the <b>bore</b> of a commercial imaging probe. Using hyperpolarized 129 Xe gas, we show that this probe enables sensitive reconstruction of NMR spectroscopic information encoded by the large imaging probe while keeping the flexibility of a large coil...|$|R

In {{order to}} assure {{precision}} {{and quality of}} boring operations, on-line tool condition monitoring is essential. In this research, Counterpropagation Neural Networks (CPN???s) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) are {{used in conjunction with}} features extracted from 3 -axis cutting force data for the on-line measurement and detection of tool wear for precision boring. Force data was collected for carbide <b>inserts</b> during the <b>boring</b> of titanium parts.

Fourteen features were extracted from the cutting force data. In order to determine which features showed the best indication of cutting tool conditions, a Sequential Forward Search (SFS) algorithm was utilized to reduce the number of features for on-line measurements and detection of precision boring of titanium parts. The selected two most prominent features were kurtosis of longitudinal force and average of the ratio between tangential force and radial force. On-line classification showed excellent results, using both a 2 x 30 x 1 CPN and a 2 x 2 ANFIS, of being able to predict tool conditions on-line with 100...|$|R

In Iteration 2, a slight cyclic pattern is observed. This {{is because of the}} reason that there is a constant progressive wear out of the <b>boring</b> bar <b>insert</b> on continued <b>boring</b> operation. After every ten components being machined, the <b>boring</b> bar <b>insert</b> must be compensated for the wear by elevating the insert by about five micrometers, over the diametric dimension. This exercise is performed {{with the help of a}} test mandrel and a <b>boring</b> bar tool <b>insert</b> setting Vee-block. Because of worn out Vee-surfaces of tool insert setting Vee-block, though the insert setting is done it is not accurate and this is reflected in the cyclic pattern observed in the second optimization step of Iteration 2. As a measure of corrective action, a new insert setting Vee-block is replaced with the old worn-out piece and the Vee surfaces of the Vee-Block are case hardened to achieve hardness up to 55 HRc with a case depth of 0.5 – 0.8  mm. In this iteration we see a marginal increase in CP to 1.32 and CPK to 0.90.|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the trapped-held characteristics of a rectangular-shaped Gd-Ba-Cu-O bulk (33 × 33 × 15 mm$^ 3 $) magnetized by pulsed-field magnetization (PFM) using split- and solenoid-type coils. A soft iron yoke was set below the bulk for the solenoid coil and two yokes are <b>inserted</b> in the <b>bores</b> of the split coil. The maximum trapped held B$_{Zmax}$ {{at the center of}} the bulk surface was 1. 73 T at 40 K in the case of the solenoid coil, with a distorted profile. On the other hand B$_{Zmax}$ was enhanced to 3. 05 T at 40 K for the split coil with two yokes for which a symmetric trapped-held profile was observed. The behavior of the magnetic flux motion indicated two conditions for the enhancement of the trapped held: that the magnetic flux intrudes easily into the bulk even for lower applied fields and then saturates with minimal flux creep. We have also investigated the electromagnetic and thermal properties of the bulk during PFM using a numerical simulation in which the magnetic flux tended to align along the z-axis due to the presence of the soft iron yoke. The use of the split coil with two yokes is effective in enhancing the trapped held for the rectangular-shaped bulks.

40|$|We have investigated, both {{experimentally}} and numerically, {{the trapped}} field {{characteristics of a}} standard Y–Ba–Cu–O bulk of 30 mm in diameter and 14 mm in thickness magnetized by pulsed field magnetization (PFM) using a split coil, in which three kinds of iron yoke are <b>inserted</b> in the <b>bore</b> of the coil: soft iron with a flat surface, soft iron with a taper, and permendur (50 Fe + 50 Co alloy) with a flat surface. The highest trapped field, B_Tmax, of 2. 93 T was achieved at 40 K {{in the case of}} the permendur yoke, which was slightly higher than that obtained for the flat soft iron or the tapered soft iron yokes, and was much higher than 2. 20 T in the case without the yoke. The insertion effect of the yoke on the trapped field characteristics was also investigated using numerical simulations. The results suggest that the saturation magnetic flux density, B_sat, of the yoke acts to reduce the flux flow due to its hysteretic magnetization curve and the higher electrical conductivity, σ, of the yoke material also acts to suppress the flux increase rate. A flux jump (or flux leap) can be reproduced in the ascending stage of PFM using numerical simulation, using an assumption of relatively high J_c(T, B) characteristics. The insertion effect of the yoke with high B_sat and σ is discussed to enhance the final trapped field from both electromagnetic and thermal points of view.

40|$|Fine needle {{aspiration}} biopsy (FNAB) is a {{rapid and}} cost-effective method for obtaining a first-line {{diagnosis of a}} palpable mass of the breast. However, {{because it can be}} difficult to manually discriminate between adipose tissue and the fibroglandular tissue more likely to harbor disease, this technique is plagued by a high number of nondiagnostic tissue draws. We have developed a portable, low coherence interferometry (LCI) instrument for FNAB guidance to combat this problem. The device contains an optical fiber probe <b>inserted</b> within the <b>bore</b> of the fine gauge needle and is capable of obtaining tissue structural information with a spatial resolution of 10  μm over a depth of approximately 1. 0  mm. For such a device to be effective clinically, algorithms that use the LCI data must be developed for classifying different tissue types. We present an automated algorithm for differentiating adipose tissue from fibroglandular human breast tissue based on three parameters computed from the LCI signal (slope, standard deviation, spatial frequency content). A total of 260 breast tissue samples from 58 patients were collected from excised surgical specimens. A training set (N = 72) was used to extract parameters for each tissue type and the parameters were fit to a multivariate normal density. The model was applied to a validation set (N = 86) using likelihood ratios to classify groups. The overall accuracy of the model was 91. 9 % (84. 0 to 96. 7) with 98. 1 % (89. 7 to 99. 9) sensitivity and 82. 4 % (65. 5 to 93. 2) specificity where the numbers in parentheses represent the 95 % confidence intervals.
