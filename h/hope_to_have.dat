As even intellectuals struggled with the sublime dialectics of infinity and corporeality, there was little <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the common folk truly internalize these, not as mere abstractions to pay lip service to.|$|E

As she explained in February 2015, [...] "I'm satisfied with the accomplishments that I've made. If I feel like I really want to come back in a few years then I can do it. The greatest thing is I don't have to." ...|$|E

Once the Moline, Illinois Amtrak station is completed sometime by 2014. In 2008, the two current United States Senators from Iowa, Tom Harkin and Chuck Grassley, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, and former Senator Barack Obama {{sent a letter}} to Amtrak asking them to begin plans to bring rail service to the Quad Cities. In October 2010, a $230million federal fund was announced that will bring Amtrak service to the Quad Cities, with a new line running from Moline to Chicago. They <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the lined completed in 2015, and offer two round trips daily to Chicago. Greyhound Lines/Burlington Trailways bus service has a station in Davenport. The building is shared with the local Davenport Citibus. Davenport does not have any river ports.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{was again}} praised by Wisden {{in its report}} on the 1948 tour. [...] "Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager, Mr Keith Johnson, {{hard-working}} and always genial," [...] it said. [...] "Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players, Mr Johnson said {{there had not been}} a discordant note in the party throughout the tour." [...] Flanagan labelled Johnson as [...] "conscientious, reserved, dignified, extraordinarily industrious and scrupulously trustworthy". He {{went on to say that}} [...] "No organization, no body corporate, no individual could ever <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a more loyal, a more devoted, or a more conscientious officer...Although to the world in general all the praise and glory for the unequalled triumph the tour proved to be goes to Sir Donald Bradman, only those who travelled with the team will ever have a proper conception of the part played in that triumph by Keith Johnson." [...] Bradman said that Johnson [...] "created friends and goodwill everywhere both for himself and the team, and no side could have wished for a better Manager". On the journey back to Australia, the players presented Johnson with a silver Georgian salver, with their signatures engraved on the memento.|$|E
500|$|Medieval Mediterranean naval warfare was {{therefore}} essentially coastal and amphibious in nature, {{carried out to}} seize coastal territory or islands, and not to exercise [...] "sea control" [...] as it is understood today. Furthermore, following the abandonment of the ram, the only truly [...] "ship-killing" [...] weapon available prior to the advent of gunpowder and explosive shells, sea combat became, {{in the words of}} John Pryor, [...] "more unpredictable. No longer could any power <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> such an advantage in weaponry or the skill of crews that success could be expected." [...] It is no surprise therefore that the Byzantine and Arab manuals emphasize cautious tactics, with the priority given to the preservation of one's own fleet, and the acquisition of accurate intelligence, often through the use of spies posing as merchants. Emphasis was placed on achieving tactical surprise and, conversely, on avoiding being caught unprepared by the enemy. Ideally, battle was to be given only when assured of superiority by virtue of numbers or tactical disposition. Importance is also laid on matching one's forces and tactics to the prospective enemy: Leo VI, for instance, contrasted (Tactica, XIX.74–77) the Arabs with their heavy and slow ships (koumbaria), to the small and fast craft (akatia, chiefly monoxyla), of the Slavs and Rus'.|$|E

2500|$|Klan leaders <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{all major}} {{candidates}} competing {{to win the}} movement's endorsement. ... The Klan's leadership wanted to keep their options open and repeatedly announced that the movement was not aligned with any political party. This non-alliance strategy was also valuable as a recruiting tool. The Klan drew its members from Democratic as well as Republican voters. If the movement had aligned itself with a single political party, it would have substantially narrowed its pool of potential recruits.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{trouble for}} the local game was brewing again in that year, when the Corinthian club {{announced}} that it would defy the ban on player payments, in order to [...] "bring the dispute with the QSFA to a head"("£1 for a win, 12/6 for a draw, and 7/6 for a losing game"). They added [...] "We <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a New South Wales team visit Queensland this season. Every member of that team will be a professional. To be logical, the association should decline to let Queensland amateurs play against them. We believe that players are entitled to a share of the profits from the game, and that Soccer in Queensland will progress when players are paid." [...] This proved to be prescient, as the NSW team thrashed Queensland 10-0 (including eight goals scored by NSW centre-forward and Australian representative, Reg Date).|$|E

2500|$|In 1950s Christchurch, New Zealand, a 14-year-old {{girl from}} a working-class family, Pauline Parker (Lynskey), befriends the more {{affluent}} English 15-year-old Juliet Hulme (Winslet) when Juliet transfers to Pauline's school. They bond over a shared history of severe childhood disease and isolating hospitalizations, {{and over time}} develop an intense friendship. Pauline admires Juliet's outspoken arrogance and beauty. Together they paint, write stories, make Plasticine figurines, and eventually create a fantasy kingdom called Borovnia. It is {{the setting of the}} adventure novels they write together, which they <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> published and eventually made into films in Hollywood. Over time it begins to be as real to them as the real world. Pauline's relationship with her mother, Honora, becomes increasingly hostile and the two fight constantly. This angry atmosphere is in contrast to the peaceful intellectual life Juliet shares with her family. Pauline spends most of her time at the Hulmes', where she feels accepted. [...] Juliet introduces Pauline to the idea of [...] "the Fourth World", a Heaven without Christians where music and art are celebrated. Juliet believes she will go there when she dies. Certain actors and musicians are [...] "saints" [...] in this afterlife.|$|E
