Natural <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> {{breast and}} {{prostate}} cancers is predicted by a novel, saturated or-dered mutation model fitted to USA (SEER) incidence data, a prediction {{consistent with the}} latest ideas in immunosurveillance. For example, the prevalence of natural <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> breast <b>cancer</b> in the white female risk population is predicted to be 76. 5 %; this immunity may be genetic and, therefore, inherited. The modeling also predicts that 6. 9 % of White Females are born with a mu-tation necessary <b>to</b> cause breast <b>cancer</b> (the hereditary form) and, therefore, are at the highest risk of developing it.

40|$|Indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) is {{the first}} and rate {{limiting}} catabolic enzyme in the degradation pathway of the essential amino acid tryptophan. By cleaving the aromatic indole ring of tryptophan, IDO initiates {{the production of a}} variety of tryptophan degradation products called “kynurenines” that are known to exert important immuno-regulatory functions. Because tryptophan must be supplied in the diet, regulation of tryptophan catabolism may exert profound effects by activating or inhibiting metabolism and immune responses. Important for survival, the regulation of IDO biosynthesis and its activity in cells of the immune system can critically alter their responses to immunological insults, such as infection, autoimmunity and cancer. In this review, we assess how IDO-mediated catabolism of tryptophan can modulate the immune system to arrest inflammation, suppress <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>cancer</b> and inhibit allergy, autoimmunity and the rejection of transplanted tissues.

40|$|During tumor progression, {{variants}} {{may arise}} that grow more vigorously.

This study also shows that CD 8 + T-cell immunity reduces the rate of tumor growth; however, the variant continues to grow and kills the host. Treatment with a monoclonal anti-granulocyte antibody that counteracts the infiltration of the tumor cell inoculum by non-T-cell leukocytes did not interfere with the CD 8 + T-cell-mediated immune response but resulted in rejection of the tumor challenge, indicating a synergy between CD 8 + T-cell-mediated immunity and the inhibition of paracrine stimulation...|$|R

The first three vaccinations were administered into the skin, 3 � 106 DCs each subcutaneously and intradermally, followed by two intravenous injections of 6 � 106 and 12 � 106 DCs, respectively. Only minor (less than or equal to grade II) side effects were observed. <b>Immunity</b> <b>to</b> the recall antigen was boosted. Significant expansions of Mage- 3 A 1 –specific CD 8 � cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors were induced in 8 / 11 patients.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) which play a {{key role}} in the {{regulation}} of immune responses. DCs are often referred to as “professional” APCs, since their primary function is to present antigens from pathogens or malignant cells. Consequently, there is a great deal of interest in how DCs might be exploited as a form of immunotherapy e. g. <b>to</b> induce <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>cancers.</b> However, DCs are also thought to play an important role in directing regulatory immune responses to innocuous antigens, which are targeted in autoimmune disease or during transplantation. Soluble factors secreted by DCs are crucial mediators in determining this balance between the immunogenic and regulatory arms of the immune system. One such group of factors is cytokines and one family which is gaining increasing attention is the IL- 12 family. It is composed of four members; two are immunogenic and their expression has been very well characterised in DCs. The other two are regulatory, but relatively little is known about their regulation and expression in DC populations.

40|$|OCT 4 is a {{transcription}} factor {{critical for the}} pluripotency of human embryonal stem (ES) and induced pluipotency stem (IPS) cells. OCT 4 is commonly expressed in germ-cell tumors as well as putative cancer stem cells in several tumors, and is a key determinant of oncogenic fate in germ-cell tumors. The capacity of the human immune system to recognize this critical stem-cell gene is not known, but has implications for preventing tumors with ES/IPS-based therapies and targeting stem-cell pathways in cancer. Here we show that OCT 4 -specific T cells can be readily detected in freshly isolated T cells from most (> 80 %) healthy donors. The reactivity to OCT 4 -derived peptides resides primarily in the CD 45 RO+ memory T-cell compartment and consists predominantly of CD 4 + T cells. T cells reactive against OCT 4 -derived peptides can be readily expanded in culture using peptide-loaded dendritic cells. In contrast <b>to</b> healthy donors, <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> OCT 4 was detected in only 35 % of patients with newly diagnosed germ-cell tumors. However, chemotherapy of germ-cell tumors led to the induction of anti-OCT 4 immunity in vivo in patients lacking such responses at baseline.

Herein we present results of investigations on the effects of human iNKT cells on Ag-specific CTL responses. iNKT cells were expanded using alphaGC-pulsed allogeneic DC derived from the acute myeloid leukemia cell line MUTZ- 3, transduced with CD 1 d to enhance iNKT cell stimulation, and with IL- 12 to stimulate type 1 cytokine production. Enhanced activation and increased IFN-gamma production was observed in iNKT cells, irrespective of CD 4 expression, upon stimulation with IL- 12 -overexpressing dendritic cells. IL- 12 -stimulated iNKT cells strongly enhanced the MART- 1 (melanoma Ag recognized by T cell 1) -specific CD 8 (+) CTL response, which was dependent on iNKT cell-derived IFN-gamma. Furthermore, autologous IL- 12 -overexpressing dendritic cells, loaded with Ag as well as alphaGC, was superior in stimulating both iNKT cells and Ag-specific CTL. This study shows that IL- 12 -overexpressing allogeneic dendritic cells expand IFN-gamma-producing iNKT cells, which may be more effective against tumors in vivo.

40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated that temporary depletion of CD 4 T cells in mice with progressive B 16 melanoma, followed by surgical tumor excision, induces protective memory CD 8 T cell responses to melanoma/melanocyte antigens. We {{also showed that}} persistence of these CD 8 T cells is supported, in an antigen-dependent fashion, by concurrent autoimmune melanocyte destruction. Herein we explore the requirement of CD 4 T cell help in priming and maintaining this protective CD 8 T cell response to melanoma. To induce melanoma/melanocyte antigen-specific CD 8 T cells, B 16 tumor bearing mice were depleted of regulatory T cells (T(reg)) by either temporary, or long-term continuous treatment with anti-CD 4 (mAb clone GK 1. 5). Total depletion of CD 4 T cells led to significant priming of IFN-γ-producing CD 8 T cell responses to TRP- 2 and gp 100. Surprisingly, treatment with anti-CD 25 (mAb clone PC 61), to specifically deplete T(reg) cells while leaving help intact, was ineffective at priming CD 8 T cells. Thirty to sixty days after primary tumors were surgically excised, mice completely lacking CD 4 T cell help developed autoimmune vitiligo, and maintained antigen-specific memory CD 8 T cell responses that were highly effective at producing cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL- 2). Mice lacking total CD 4 T cell help also mounted protection against re-challenge with B 16 melanoma sixty days after primary tumor excision.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the results of}} the experiments reported in this investigation shows that the changes so frequently observed in tissues surrounding a growing tumor may be caused by different conditions. The development and growth of a malignant tumor depends upon a local interaction between tumor cells and organ cells. When the cells of a normal organ are capable of inhibiting tumor growth, then an impairment of the normal state of the parenchymatous cells of this particular organ is essential for the growth of the tumor. This "precancerous state" does not consist primarily of an inflammatory change in the adjacent connective tissue, as Ribbert and his followers maintain, but in a degeneration of the parenchymatous cells of the organ. If, in another instance, the cells of the normal organs are unable to inhibit the proliferation of the tumor cells, then no preparation of the cells of the organ for the tumor is necessary, i. e., no "precancerous state" is needed to enable the tumor to grow. On the other hand, the proliferating tumor cells injure normal cells, either mechanically or chemically, producing a condition that appears on superficial examination like that described as the "precancerous state. " In reality, however, this condition is the resultant effect of the tumor growth and may be more correctly designated the "postcancerous state. " In these conditions, then, von Hansemann's explanation of the phenomenon, and not Ribbert's, seems to be the correct one. Of still greater importance is the fact demonstrated in the last series of experiments; namely, that the general condition of resistance or <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>cancer</b> growth exerts a greater influence on the organism of the animal than any of the local conditions described above. The local resistance of a testicle to tumor growth in a generally susceptible animal may be overcome, but if an animal is made generally immune to the growth of cancer, neither the animal as a whole nor a single organ or tissue in it can be made susceptible to the growth of the tumor...|$|R

It is likely that the application {{of a wide range of}} proteomics tools <b>to</b> breast <b>cancer</b> will yield a panel of markers that have utility for breast cancer diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Several immune based therapies {{targeting}} {{prostate cancer}} associated proteins are currently undergoing clinical investigation. In general, however, {{little is known}} about the immunogenicity of prostate cancer or which prostate cancer associated proteins elicit immune responses. We determine whether patients with prostate <b>cancer</b> have antibody <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> known prostate <b>cancer</b> associated proteins, what the prevalence of this immunity is and whether <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> individual proteins is associated with the stage of disease. Materials and Methods: We evaluated the inherent humoral immune response against prostate specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid phosphatase, p 53 and HER- 2 /neu, all known prostate cancer associated proteins, in 200 patients with various stages of disease and male controls. Results: Antibody <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> PSA was significantly different between the patient (11 %, 22 of 200) and control populations (1. 5 %, 3 of 100, p � 0. 02), and titers 1 : 100 or greater were particularly prevalent in the subgroup of patients with androgen independent disease (11 %, 6 of 56). Antibody <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> prostatic acid phosphatase and p 53 was detected (5. 5 %, 11 of 200 and 6 %, 12 of 200), and was not different from the control population (4 %, 4 of 100, p � 0. 57 and 7 %...|$|R
40|$|Gamma delta T cells (γδ T cells) possess innate-like {{properties}} and are proposed {{to bridge the}} gap between innate and adaptive immunity. In this study, we explored the role of γδ T cells in cutaneous immunity using a skin transplantation model. Following engraftment of skin expressing cell–associated model antigen (Ag) (ovalbumin) in epithelial keratinocytes, skin-resident γδ T cells enhanced graft rejection. Although the effector function of CD 8 T cells was intact in the absence of γδ T cells, cross-priming of CD 8 T cell to graft-derived Ag was impaired in the absence of γδ T cells. The reduced graft rejection and graft priming of γδ T-cell–deficient mice was evident in both acutely inflamed and well-healed grafting models. Furthermore, expression of the CD 40 activation marker on migrating dendritic cells was lower in TCRδ−/− mice compared with wild-type mice, regardless of the presence or absence of inflammation associated with grafting. These results indicate that γδ T cells enhance graft priming and consequently the likelihood of a successful immune outcome in the context of skin graft rejection, suggesting that γδ T cells may be an important component of <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> epithelial <b>cancers</b> or infection...|$|R
5000|$|In 1965, {{one event}} exposed {{possible}} foul play in Prioré's experimental research involving [...] "English mice." [...] Mice with experimental <b>cancers</b> sent <b>to</b> Prioré from the Chester Beatty Institute in England lead to controversy over his research. After Prioré exposed the mice to radiation from his devices, {{they were sent}} back to the Institute. Scientists from the Institute claimed the mice returned to them were not genuine because they rejected new cancer grafts. One scientist with the Institute, Pierette Chateaurenaud-Duprat, retorted the claim stating the mice showed signs of <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cancers</b> they were originally grafted with. (Graille, 1984) Prioré's colleagues supported his research until his death in 1983. Immunologist Raymond Pautrizel and Robert Courier, former secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, published a series of notes on Prioré's research in the proceedings of the French Academy. (Graille, 1984) Pautrizel, an apologist, classified Prioré's methodology as immunological in nature, since animals inoculated with deadly doses of parasites were reportedly healed with Prioré radiation. According to Bird (1984), a supporter, Priore's methodology was also characterized by boosting subjects' immune systems, allowing them to heal themselves of incurable diseases.|$|R
