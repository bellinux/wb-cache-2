40|$|The central {{problem of}} {{designing}} intelligent robot systems which learn by demonstrations of desired behaviour {{has been largely}} studied {{within the field of}} robotics.

However, little work has been done addressing how a group of robots can learn by simultaneous demonstrations of multiple teachers. This paper contributes a novel approach for learning multirobot <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> from unlabelled data. The robots firstly learn the demonstrated sequence of individual actions using the HAMMER architecture. Subsequently, the group behaviour is segmented over time and space by applying a spatio-temporal clustering algorithm. The experimental results, in which humans teleoperated real robots during a search and rescue task deployment, successfully demonstrated the efficacy of combining action recognition at individual level with group behaviour segmentation, spotting the exact moment when robots must form coalitions to achieve the goal, thus yielding reasonable generation of multirobot <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|E

Despite the relatively straightforward process of preparing the joint policies, implementation at national and local level raises several issues.

Moreover, in some cases, the local knowledge used during disaster response could lose its relevance because of climate change and the impact on marine and terrestrial ecosystems.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in the dairy sector to move from producing bulk dairy commodities towards producing specialized dairy products aimed at niche markets. Dairy farmers consider shifting from commodity milk to raw milk with specialized composition to meet consumer or industrial demands. In this context, the objectives of the thesis were 1) to assess qualitatively future scenarios to create value added in the dairy chain and 2) to ex-ante assess quantitatively the technical and economic implications at farm level of producing differentiated raw milk by using genetic selection. A two-step approach was applied, where the first step assessed qualitatively the strategic opportunities offered by a wide range of novel methods emerging at various stages in the production chain, whereas the second step assessed quantitatively the implications of specific strategies on farm level. The main findings indicate that creating value added is vital for the sustainable growth of the dairy industry, and producing raw milk with specialized characteristics by using novel breeding concepts can {{play an important role in}} this process. The ex-ante quantitative assessments have found no evidence that implementing novel genetic selection strategies to change fat or protein composition in milk would have large effects on herd production and profitability. The stakeholders of the dairy industry should initiate <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> to capitalize on the opportunities offered by recent milk genomics research.  ...|$|E

Conversely, there are pockets of unimmunized children across eight LGAs with the highest burden in Remo-North (23 %). The exact factors responsible for this trend are yet to be determined. Objective A participatory evaluation and action research (PAR) aims through iterative processes of reflection and action, between communities, health workers and local authorities to provide context specific solutions to barriers to access and use of immunization services in Remo-North. A formative evaluation assesses the relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of the PAR. Methods Situational analysis was carried out at baseline, results of which were validated by community members, health workers and local government officials and used in an interactive learning process through dialogues between these groups, facilitated by the researchers. <b>Joint</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plans</b> for change were developed and are being implemented in a first action phase of 4 months.

40|$|Although {{triangular}} cooperation (TrC) between the European Union (EU) and Brazil in Africa {{is still in}} its early stages, recent <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> (2008; 2011) establish certain principles such as solidarity and local empowerment. In addition, they identify climate change, sustainable development and renewable energy as one of TrC priority areas. The recent strategic partnership between EU and Brazil for the biofuel production in Mozambique already raises many questions. The project aims to increase efficiency of bioethanol, biodiesel and bioelectricity production by intensifying agricultural production in lands of Mozambique. Currently, a feasibility study for project implementation is underway. However, many critics have been raised regarding the lack of transparency and the top down process of the project. The critics also raise awareness for the issues of environmental land degradation, food insecurity and land grabbing. Thus, {{there seems to be a}} gap between the rhetoric of the EU and Brazil about TrC principles and the reality that is emerging in Africa. Therefore, it is relevant to ask ourselves whether the TrC reflects principles of solidarity and development or respond to the interests of the « donnors »? This article will attempt to analyze the strategic and commercial interests behind this partnership. As part of the energy policy of the EU that aims to use 20 % of renewable energy by 2020, its need for biofuel is undeniable. The creation of new biofuel supply platforms in Africa, which could be acquired to minimum taxe level, is definitively in its best interests.
