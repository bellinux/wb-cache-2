5|$|Heyer {{specialised}} in {{two types}} of romantic male leads, which she called Mark I and Mark II. Mark I, with overtones of Mr Rochester, was (<b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>words)</b> “rude, overbearing, and often a bounder”. Mark II by contrast was debonair, sophisticated, and often a style-icon. Similarly, her heroines (reflecting Austen's division between lively and gentle) fell into two broad groups: the tall and dashing, mannish type, and the quiet bullied type.|$|E
5|$|Aslam and Khan confront {{one another}} as the police, having been alerted to Khan's {{location}} by a storekeeper, descend upon Dongri. Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend {{himself in front of}} Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Awant appears through the gathered crowd - even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Awant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognize the truth <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>words</b> as he drops his weapon and stares at the couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on Bahá'í themes. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>words</b> in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E

She also praises societies that are progressive with regard to gender relations—she wrote, for example, [...] "No slur was cast by the [...] Italians on feminine accomplishments...Where abstruse learning was a fashion among men, they were glad to find in their friends of the other sex, minds educated to share their pursuits".|$|E

[...] They married in the Dominican Republic in secrecy, denying it for nearly two months afterwards. The marriage was, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>words,</b> [...] "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active." [...] The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a ploy to prop up Jackson's public image. The marriage ended {{less than two years}} later with an amicable divorce settlement. In a 2010 interview with Oprah, Presley said they had spent four more years after the divorce [...] "getting back together and breaking up" [...] until she decided to stop.|$|E
500|$|She did {{not agree}} with {{allowing}} spiritual and magical techniques to transmit between different cultures, believing that to do so caused damage; she for instance cautioned against allowing Western esoteric teachings to be practiced in India because [...] "the Hindu dies readily from shock". Equally she strongly opposed the adoption of Asian religious techniques into Western esotericism, distancing herself from occultists who did so. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>words,</b> she must [...] "recommend to the white races the traditional Western system, which is admirably adapted to their psychic constitution". She nevertheless perceived value in Westerners studying Asian disciplines like Yoga on a theoretical level, so long as they eschewed any attempt to put these teachings into practice.|$|E
500|$|For Shelley, biographical {{writing was}} {{supposed}} to, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>words,</b> [...] "form {{as it were}} a school in which to study the philosophy of history", and to teach [...] "lessons". Most frequently and importantly, these lessons consisted of criticisms of male-dominated institutions such as primogeniture. Shelley emphasises domesticity, romance, family, sympathy, and compassion {{in the lives of}} her subjects. Her conviction that such forces could improve society connects her biographical approach with that of other early feminist historians such as Mary Hays and Anna Jameson. Unlike her novels, most of which had an original print run of several hundred copies, the Lives had a print run of about 4,000 for each volume: thus, according to Kucich, Mary Shelley's [...] "use of biography to forward the social agenda of women's historiography became one of her most influential political interventions".|$|E

As the child sexual abuse accusations became public, he became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and his addiction to drugs. She explained, [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong {{and that he was}} wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it." [...] In one phone call he made to her, she described him as high, incoherent and delusional.

[...] She also said [...] "Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners, and if you kick us all out, you'll have nothing to watch except for football and mixed martial arts, which are not arts". Trump responded on Twitter by calling Streep [...] "one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood" [...] and [...] "a Hillary flunky who lost big".
