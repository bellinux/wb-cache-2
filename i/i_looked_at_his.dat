2500|$|... "When I {{was first}} {{working on the}} sketch for the album cover, my mom {{introduced}} me to a young Russian artist named Alexis Steele. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> sketch for the cover and I saw that struggle - all the struggle that I'm singing about. It IS the divine comedy." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> demure and {{resolute}} mouth, {{and wondered}} if he had.|$|E
60|$|Trotter paused. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> tattered {{clothes and}} at his deeply sunburnt, hard, {{thoughtful}} face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gave me six, the cad," [...] said he, [...] "just because <b>I</b> had a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> beastly study. Why shouldn't <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> study if <b>I</b> like? I've a jolly good mind {{to go up}} {{and have}} another squint." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, poor lad," [...] {{the officer}} said. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> face <b>I</b> confess my sympathies are all with him {{rather than with}} the man he killed." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2014, He was {{pointing}} at the moon but <b>I</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> hand, National Arts Festival, Grahamstown ...|$|R
60|$|Here Mr. Drummle {{looked at}} his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr. Drummle looked at my boots, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his.</b>|$|E
60|$|I suppose I took a woman's {{view of the}} matter. I lost {{my temper}} when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{beautiful}} complexion and thought of the future.|$|E
60|$|There was a pause. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> big {{twitching}} face, {{and listened}} to the heavy wheezing of his breath, and I felt sorry for him.|$|E
5000|$|A mezzo-soprano, Allitsen {{was also}} {{well known as}} a singing teacher. She is {{reported}} by several sources as having kept a photograph of Lord Kitchener of Khartoum on her piano. Having been in poor health for many years, she told a reporter, [...] "Whenever I feel like shirking my duty <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> portrait." [...] She later read herself quoted as having said {{that she could not}} compose without a picture of Lord Kitchener before her.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him, <b>his</b> proud, eagle face, and his tall, sinewy figure, and I {{wondered}} {{whether in the}} whole land there was a finer, handsomer man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Child as I was," [...] remarked Paulina, [...] "I {{wonder how}} I dared be so venturous. To me he seems now all sacred, his locks are inaccessible, and, Lucy, I feel {{a sort of}} fear, when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> firm, marble chin, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{straight}} Greek features. Women are called beautiful, Lucy; he is not like a woman, therefore I suppose he is not beautiful, but what is he, then? Do other people see him with my eyes? Do you admire him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{climbed to}} the top of a {{mountain}} one day [...] To see the sun setting in glory, [...] And I thought, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> vanishing ray, [...] Of a perfectly splendid story.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a philosopher, Monsieur; a cynic philosopher" [...] (and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> palet√¥t, {{of which}} he {{straightway}} brushed the dim sleeve with his hand), [...] "despising the foibles of humanity--above its luxuries--independent of its comforts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} trust myself to speak longer with the man. The more <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> fat, frightened face, the harder did {{it seem that}} we should slay him in cold blood. It was best to get it over.|$|E
6000|$|I will {{confess that}} that Mordet Island {{nightmare}} of mine returned, and as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him <b>his</b> hand {{went out for}} the drug again. [...] "Stomach, George," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{singular}} question. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him quickly. <b>His</b> face was sphinxlike.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a very, {{very poor}} boy, father," [...] the girl replied. [...] "At least I don't think so; but <b>I</b> only <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> face. He didn't speak like a poor boy at all." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked very}} cheerful, and laughed loudly {{as he entered}} the coffee-room. From the moment that <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> face I knew, somehow, that Hercule and I had been fooled, and that now, indeed, we stood eye to eye with that mysterious personage who is called the Scarlet Pimpernel.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have only}} to add that the {{photograph}} you enclose, taken by a Mr. Inglewood, is undoubtedly that of the burglar in question. When I got home that night <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> card, and he was inscribed there {{under the name of}} Innocent Smith.--Yours faithfully, [...] "John Clement Hawkins." ...|$|E
60|$|So Indaba-zimbi sauntered off, and as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{retreating}} form I thought I {{should never}} see it again. But I was mistaken, and little {{knew that he was}} risking his life, not for the Boers whom he hated one and all, but for me whom in his queer way he loved.|$|E
6000|$|... "'It was,' says Andy. 'It was his own. When <b>I</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> curios {{yesterday}} {{he stepped out}} of the room for a moment and I pocketed it. Now, will you pick up your suit case and hurry?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Jones' {{explained}} {{after the}} match that he [...] "wasn't sure (Griffin) was down. I didn't {{have time to}} think and see whether he was down. I thought he was down and he might come back <b>at</b> me. <b>I</b> wasn't <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> knees. <b>I</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> face." [...] Jones also put the blame on referee Tony Perez, saying [...] "I didn't feel the ref try to separate me at all." [...] Perez reiterated that he began counting Griffin out because, he should've been able to continue, he would've only taken one or two point from Jones. However, when Griffin was unable to continue, Perez was left with no choice but to disqualify Jones for the foul.|$|R
6000|$|But when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> round <b>at</b> <b>his</b> comfortable, {{and almost}} luxurious cabin, and then <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{handsome}} care-free face, I {{thought he was}} only trying to frighten me, and I answered, [...] "Well, sir, I am ready to try it." ...|$|R
60|$|As the trader spoke, Makarooroo {{came forward}} and shook hands {{with him in the}} English fashion. He was then {{introduced}} to us, and expressed his willingness to become our interpreter in somewhat curious but quite comprehensible English. As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> intelligent, good-natured countenance, I could not help thinking that the trader had underrated his intellectual powers.|$|E
6000|$|... "If India {{was filled}} with men like you and me, not knowing more than the crows where they'd get their next day's rations, it isn't seventy {{millions}} of revenue the land would be paying--it's seven hundred millions," [...] said he; and as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> mouth and chin I was disposed to agree with him.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} on Judson Tate's mind, and, {{such as it}} was, he tried to convey it to me. Already he had accepted me as his friend; and when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> great, snuff-brown first-mate's hand, with which he brought emphasis to his periods, within six inches of my nose, I wondered if, by any chance, he was as sudden in conceiving enmity against strangers.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him narrowly. <b>His</b> {{frenzy of}} the {{previous}} day had all calmed down. I determined to give him another chance.|$|R
60|$|THE BYSTANDER. He ain't a tec. He's a {{blooming}} busybody: that's what he is. <b>I</b> tell you, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> boots.|$|R
60|$|As I sauntered on, I {{found the}} {{gardener}} hard <b>at</b> <b>his</b> evening employment, and saluted him, as <b>I</b> paused to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> work.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> round, ripe face, {{on which}} was fixed a smile unchanging as that {{worn by the}} masks on mummy coffins, from which I think he must have copied it, and at the cold, deep eyes above, and shivered a little. To tell truth I feared this man, whom I felt {{to be in touch}} with presences and things that are not of our world, and thought it wisest to {{withstand}} him no more.|$|E
60|$|He {{appeared}} to be still in an extreme state of nervousness, starting from time to time, and gazing furtively about him, with little frightened, darting glances {{to the right and}} the left. I hoped that his daughter was right in naming the fifth of October as the turning point of his complaint, for it was evident to me as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> gleaming eyes and quivering hands, that a man could not live long in such a state of nervous tension.|$|E
60|$|Why, like Dr Phelps, Mr Pellew {{referred}} {{to me as}} we I had not time to consider, for he was already confiding to Mrs Monnerie {{that he had never}} baptized an infant who more strenuously objected to Holy Water than had I. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> long, fair eyelashes and the smile-line on his cheek as he bent with a sort of jocular urbanity over her chair, but could not recall his younger face, though during my christening I must, of course, have gazed at him even more absorbedly.|$|E
60|$|I go up into my {{own little}} attic. My cot stands in the corner, and my bricks lie tumbled out upon the floor (I was always an untidy child). An old man enters--an old, bent, {{withered}} man--holding a lamp above <b>his</b> head, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> face, {{and it is my}} own face. And another enters, and he also is myself. Then more and more, till the room is thronged with faces, and the stair-way beyond, and all the silent house. Some of the faces are old and others young, and some are fair and smile at me, and many are foul and leer at me. And every face is my own face, but no two of them are alike.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> stole a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> gnarled hands. Any finger {{would have}} made three of mine. His wrist {{would have made}} three of my wrist.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> him. <b>His</b> good, homely {{face was}} close to mine, and in his eyes was an unmistakable look of love and tenderness.|$|R
