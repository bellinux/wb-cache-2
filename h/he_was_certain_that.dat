5|$|Cimon, on {{the other}} hand, {{apparently}} believed that no further free space for democratic evolution existed. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> democracy had reached its peak and Pericles' reforms were leading to the stalemate of populism. According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles' death, sank into the abyss of political turmoil and demagogy. Paparrigopoulos maintains that an unprecedented regression descended upon the city, whose glory perished {{as a result of}} Pericles' populist policies.|$|E
5|$|After {{removing}} her corpse {{from the}} canvas sack and beginning the post mortem examination, pathologist Keith Simpson told Ranson <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Rivett {{had been killed}} before her body {{was placed in the}} sack, and that in his opinion the lead pipe found at the scene could be the murder weapon. Her estranged husband, Roger, had an alibi for the night concerned, and was eliminated from police inquiries. Other male friends and boyfriends were questioned and discounted as suspects. Her parents confirmed that Sandra had a good working relationship with Lady Lucan, and was extremely fond of the children. Meanwhile, Lucan had yet to make an appearance, and so his description was circulated to police forces across the country. Newspapers and television stations were told only that Lucan was wanted by the police for questioning.|$|E

5|$|On {{the advice}} of Rommel and Jodl, Hitler decided that the Italian Peninsula could not be held without the {{assistance}} of the Italian Army. Kesselring was ordered to withdraw from southern Italy and consolidate his Army Group C with Rommel's Army Group B in Northern Italy, where Rommel would assume overall command. Kesselring was slated to be posted to Norway. Kesselring was appalled at the prospect of abandoning Italy. It would expose southern Germany to bombers operating from Italy; risk the Allies breaking into the Po Valley; and was completely unnecessary, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Rome could be held until the summer of 1944. This assessment was based on his belief that the Allies would not conduct operations outside the range of their air cover, which could only reach as far as Salerno. Kesselring submitted his resignation on 14 August 1943.|$|E
25|$|On August 13, Lee sent Maj. Gen. James Longstreet to {{reinforce}} Jackson {{and on the}} following day sent all of his remaining forces except for two brigades, after <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> McClellan was leaving the Peninsula. Lee himself arrived at Gordonsville to take command on August 15. His plan was to defeat Pope before McClellan's army could arrive {{to reinforce}} it by cutting bridges in Pope's rear and then attacking his left flank and rear. Pope spoiled Lee's plans by withdrawing to the line of the Rappahannock River; he was aware of Lee's plan because a Union cavalry raid captured a copy of the written order.|$|E
25|$|Returning in the ships, Antón de Alaminos imposed {{slow and}} {{vigilant}} navigation, moving only by day, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Yucatán was an island. The travellers' greatest hardship, {{a scarcity of}} potable water aboard, added to their woes. The stores of water, casks and jugs were not of the quality required for long voyages ("we were too poor to buy good ones", laments Bernal); the casks were constantly losing water and they also failed to keep it fresh, and so de Córdoba's ships needed to replenish their supplies ashore. The Spaniards had already noted that the region seemed to be devoid of freshwater rivers.|$|E

25|$|After the {{introduction}} of conscription in January 1916, the territorials were able to be sent overseas and Blythe was identified for overseas service in 1917 and underwent training at Marlow. By this time some cricket had resumed in England and the KFE had played a number of matches against other service sides. Blythe's final match was at Lord's in August 1917 for an Army and Navy side against one made up of Australians and South Africans. By this time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> {{he would not be}} able to play cricket professionally once the war was over and was appointed as cricket coach at Eton College, intending to take up the position once the war was over.|$|E
25|$|The Confederates {{lost two}} key commanders, Mouton and Green, and {{suffered}} casualties {{they could not}} afford. Perhaps more importantly, relations between the aggressive Taylor and cautious Smith were permanently damaged by their disagreement over Smith's decision to remove half of Taylor's troops following the Battle of Pleasant Hill. The lost opportunity to capture the entire Union fleet as it lay helpless above the falls at Alexandria haunted Taylor to his dying day; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Smith had robbed {{him a chance to}} cripple the Union forces. The arguments between the two generals resulted in Taylor's transfer to command of the Department of East Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama soon after the campaign ended.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Marjorie Garber {{argued that}} {{metamorphosis}} {{is both the}} major subject of the play and the model of its structure. She noted that in this play, the entry in the woods is a dream-like change in perception, a change which affects both the characters and the audience. Dreams here take priority over reason, and are truer than the reality they seek to interpret and transform. Also in 1974, Alexander Leggatt offered his own reading of the play. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> there are grimmer elements in the play, but they are overlooked because the audience focuses {{on the story of}} the sympathetic young lovers. He viewed the characters as separated into four groups which interact in various ways. Among the four, the fairies stand as the most sophisticated and unconstrained. The contrasts between the interacting groups produce the play's comic perspective.|$|E

25|$|On August 13, Lee sent Longstreet to {{reinforce}} Jackson, {{and on the}} following day Lee sent all of his remaining forces (except for two brigades) after <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> McClellan was leaving the Peninsula. Lee arrived at Gordonsville to take command on August 15. He massed the Army of Northern Virginia south of Clark's Mountain and planned a turning movement to defeat Pope before McClellan's army could arrive {{to reinforce}} it. His plan was to send his cavalry under Stuart, followed by his entire army, north to the Rapidan River on August 18, screened from view by Clark's Mountain. Stuart would cross and destroy the railroad bridge at Somerville Ford and then move around Pope's left flank into the Federal rear, destroying supplies and blocking their possible avenues of retreat. Logistical difficulties and cavalry movement delays caused the plan to be abandoned.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1960 that later {{research}} by Eugene Merle Shoemaker confirmed Barringer's hypothesis. The key discovery was the presence in the crater of the minerals coesite and stishovite, rare forms of silica found only where quartz-bearing rocks have been severely shocked by an instantaneous overpressure. It cannot be created by volcanic action; the only known mechanisms of creating it is naturally through an impact event, or artificially through a nuclear explosion. Shoemaker was uniquely aware of this {{as he had been}} researching the shocked mineral formations that were formed after the nuclear detonation testing in the Nevada desert. Therefore, when similar minerals were seen at the Barringer Crater, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> a similar kind of sudden shock compression was responsible for the crater, which effectively ruled out the then more mainstream view that the crater {{was the result of a}} comparatively less sudden volcanic eruption.|$|E
25|$|Former NFL coach Tony Dungy {{later told}} Profootballtalk.com <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Williams {{operated}} a similar bounty system {{while he was}} defensive coordinator of the Oilers/Titans from 1997 to 2000. He also believes that Williams put a bounty on Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning during Super Bowl XLIV, and targeted Manning on several occasions while with the Titans. The revelation of the bounty system also caused renewed speculation about a 2006 game between the Redskins and Colts, in which Manning was knocked down by a high-low hit from the Redskins' Phillip Daniels and Andre Carter and appeared to lose some feeling in his neck. While Dungy didn't speculate at the time about whether the Redskins targeted Manning on that play, he believes that hit ultimately caused the neck problems that sidelined Manning for the entire 2011 season and led to his departure for the Denver Broncos afterward.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, as he {{left the}} room and crossed the hall Deane was {{conscious}} of feeling more than a little puzzled. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> quite <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not told a soul at the office of the Incorporated Gold-Mines Association, over which he presided, that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> lunching at the Carlton. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> equally <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not told anyone else.

25|$|The {{first human}} {{clinical}} trial was unsuccessful. Banting was insufficiently qualified {{to participate and}} felt sidelined. By the winter of 1922, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> all Macleod's colleagues were conspiring against him. Collip threatened to leave because of the strained atmosphere, but the encouragement of others who saw the potential of their research prevented escalation of the conflict. In January 1922, the team performed the first successful clinical trial, on 14-year-old Leonard Thompson, and it was soon followed by others. Although all the team members were listed as co-authors of their publications, Banting still felt overlooked, because Macleod took over the coordination of clinical trials and the acquisition of larger amounts of extract. Macleod's presentation {{at a meeting of}} the Association of American Physicians in Washington, D.C., on 3 May 1922 received a standing ovation, but Banting and Best refused to participate in protest. At that time, demonstrations of the method's efficiency drew huge public interest, because the effect on patients, especially children, who until then were bound to die, seemed almost miraculous. The pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly & Co. took over mass production, but without an exclusive license, as the patent was transferred to the British Medical Research Council to prevent exploitation.|$|E
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E

500|$|Cambridge won by {{a margin}} of 12 lengths in a time of 20 minutes 50 seconds, {{securing}} their fifth consecutive victory. [...] It was the largest winning margin since the 1900 race and the slowest winning time since the 1947 race. [...] Crowden later noted that while he believed the initially sinking to be more down to [...] "inferior oarsmanship rather than an accident", <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> his crew would have failed to finish the course had they been allowed to continue. [...] The rowing correspondent of The Manchester Guardian suggested that [...] "the 1951 race, with anti-climax following disaster, is best forgotten as quickly as may be." [...] The victory took the overall record in the event to 53–43 in Cambridge's favour.|$|E
500|$|Theroux {{described}} approaching filming without entirely {{understanding what}} the plot was about: [...] "You {{get the whole}} script, but {{he might as well}} withhold the scenes you're not in, because the whole turns out to be more mystifying than the parts. David welcomes questions, but he won't answer any of them... You work kind of half-blindfolded. If he were a first-time director and hadn't demonstrated any command of this method, I'd probably have reservations. But it obviously works for him." [...] Theroux noted that the only answer Lynch did provide was that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Theroux's character, a Hollywood director, was not autobiographical of Lynch. Watts stated that she tried to bluff Lynch by pretending she had the plot figured out, and that he delighted in the cast's frustration.|$|E
500|$|The West German trade {{interests}} in the Arab countries {{as well as the}} desire to be spared from future acts of terror were alleged as motives for a government involvement. Shortly after the events surrounding Flight 615, Haim Yosef Zadok accused West Germany in a Knesset speech of having [...] "used the opportunity to improve its relations to the Arab world." [...] In his 1999 autobiography, Abu Daoud (the mastermind behind the Munich massacre) claims that he had been offered $9 million by [...] "the Germans" [...] for faking the prisoner release. In later years, he refused to repeat or elaborate this allegation, though. In a 2006 interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Zvi Zamir, the head of Mossad from 1968 to 1974, states that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> there had been some kind of an agreement between West Germany and Black September.|$|E
