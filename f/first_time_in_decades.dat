5|$|The Republicans won {{control of}} both houses of the {{legislature}} for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades,</b> while Dayton narrowly defeated Republican candidate Tom Emmer with 44% of the vote. Many of the newly elected Republican legislators were affiliated with the Tea Party movement and had more anti-government positions than the Republican establishment. Both Dayton and Republican legislators claimed a popular mandate for their positions.|$|E
5|$|In late 1922, Boyce {{departed}} {{on another}} expedition to Africa, {{this time for}} six months. Morocco {{reminded him of the}} Dakotas, Kansas, Texas, Florida, and Arizona. In Egypt he visited the tomb of Tutankhamun, which had been discovered just a few months earlier. His expedition then went to Luxor and sailed up the Nile River to Edfu, where the houses had no roofs and while he was there it rained and hailed for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades.</b> Boyce stated that between his two expeditions to Africa, he had shot at least one of every game animal.|$|E
5|$|The reforms, {{combined}} with unprecedented amounts of funding from foreign loans, spurred rapid economic growth; but this growth was punctuated by sharp recessions and financial crises in 1994, 1999 (following the earthquake of that year), and 2001; {{resulting in an}} average of 4 percent GDP growth per annum between 1981 and 2003. Lack of additional fiscal reforms, {{combined with}} large and growing public sector deficits and widespread corruption, resulted in high inflation, a weak banking sector and increased macroeconomic volatility. Since the economic crisis of 2001 and the reforms initiated by the finance minister of the time, Kemal Derviş, inflation has dropped to single-digit figures for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades</b> (8% in 2005), investor confidence and foreign investment have soared, and unemployment has fallen (10% in 2005).|$|E

5|$|The {{three decades}} after the 1952 Grey Cup victory have been called the Argonauts' Dark Ages. The team went thirty-one years between {{championship}} victories and nineteen without even making an appearance in the final. Part of the reason was a salary cap introduced in 1953 that cost them many talented players. For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades,</b> they began ranking {{at the bottom of}} the Eastern Division. The management style under new owner John Bassett has also been blamed: young talent was traded or allowed to leave and the team could not form a nucleus of championship players; coaches came and went rapidly. Two notable events occurred off-field at the end of the 1950s: in 1958 the Argonauts became a founding member of the Canadian Football League and a year later found a new home at Exhibition Stadium.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1900s and early 2000s, baseball's {{position}} compared to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions. In 2008, Major League Baseball set a revenue record of $6.5billion, matching the NFL's {{revenue for the}} <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades.</b> A new MLB revenue record of $6.6 billion was set in 2009. On the other hand, the percentage of American sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 16%, compared to pro football at 31%. In 1985, the respective figures were pro football 24%, baseball 23%. Because {{there are so many}} more major league games played, there is no comparison in overall attendance. In 2008, total attendance at major league games was the second-highest in history: 78.6 million, 0.7% off the record set the previous year. The following year, amid the U.S. recession, attendance fell by 6.6% to 73.4 million. Attendance at games held under the Minor League Baseball umbrella also set a record in 2007, with 42.8 million; this figure does not include attendance at games of the several independent minor leagues.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{peaceful}} {{transfer of power}} from Bonilla to General Sierra in 1899 was important as the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades</b> that such a constitutional transition had taken place, that year was a watershed in another, even more important, sense.|$|E

25|$|The DEGC {{awarded the}} {{demolition}} contract on April 22, 2008, with the speculation that demolition revenue {{would come from}} the sale of scrap metal and not from the City of Detroit. Wrecking crews commenced operations on June 30, in the wall behind the old bleacher section facing I-75 near the intersection of Trumbull Avenue. The demolition of the left field stands opened up the stadium's interior to view for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades</b> on July 9, 2008 (the ballpark had been double-decked since the late 1930s).|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{nuclear weapon}} design {{was in the}} news again, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades.</b> In January, the U.S. House of Representatives {{released}} the Cox Report (Christopher Cox R-CA) which alleged that China had somehow acquired classified information about the U.S. W88 warhead. Nine months later, Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwanese immigrant working at Los Alamos, was publicly accused of spying, arrested, and served nine months in pre-trial detention, before the case against him was dismissed. It {{is not clear that}} there was, in fact, any espionage.|$|E
25|$|The austral ("₳") (ISO 4217: ARA) {{replaced}} the peso argentino {{at a rate}} of 1 austral to 1000 pesos (one billion pesos m$n). During the period of circulation of the austral, Argentina suffered from hyperinflation. The last months of President Raul Alfonsín's period in office in 1989 saw prices move up constantly (200% in July alone), with a consequent fall {{in the value of the}} currency. Emergency notes of 10,000, 50,000 and 500,000 australes were issued, and provincial administrations issued their own currency for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades.</b> The value of the currency stabilized soon after President Carlos Menem was elected.|$|E

25|$|The 2006 East–West Shrine Game {{was played}} in the Alamodome on January 21, 2006. The game is an annual post-season college {{football}} all-star game. For most of its history, the game has been {{played in the}} San Francisco Bay Area, at San Francisco's Kezar Stadium and at Stanford Stadium. In recent years it has been played at AT Park. In 2006, the game was played in the Alamodome, {{moving out of the}} San Francisco Bay Area for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades.</b> The Shrine Game was moved once again for its 2007 event, to Robertson Stadium in Houston.|$|E
25|$|The album, titled Back to the Rock was {{released}} for digital download in November 2010, with hard copies also {{sold at the}} band's November concert taping. It featured re-recordings of 10 classic Petra songs from the early and mid-1980s, {{as well as two}} new tracks. Hard copies of the CD went on sale in January 2011. That same month, the members of Classic Petra played a live show together for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades,</b> taping the concert at the TBN studios, with a documentary preceding the concert. Though recorded ostensibly for broadcast on TBN and eventual DVD release, the show first found life as a live album, released digitally to iTunes and Amazon in April 2011. A companion DVD {{was released}} that July. In July 2011, Classic Petra again performed at Cornerstone Festival, closing the day of classic Christian rock.|$|E
25|$|With silver cloth {{covering}} the entire painting, {{except for the}} face and hands, {{it was very hard}} for art historians to determine in what period the painting was created. In 1927, the silver cover was removed for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades.</b> The painting was analyzed and restored. Based on the new data gathered during the restoration, Mieczysław Skrudlik came to a conclusion that the painting was completed around 1630–50 and linked it with another painting in the Corpus Christi Church in Kraków, created by artist Luke in 1624. Mary Kałamajska Saeed in her 1990 thesis argued that Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn was a work of a local artist and was inspired by contemporary Flemish mannerist painter Marten de Vos through an engraving of Thomas de Leu. In 1993, on the occasion of pope's visit, the painting was restored and one of its planks was dated based on its tree-rings. The scientists concluded that the oak grew in 1434–1620.|$|E

25|$|Egypt was {{the first}} nation to abandon boycott, doing so in 1980 after signing a peace treaty with Israel the {{previous}} year. After more or less consistently adhering {{to the practice of}} seizing cargo bound for Israel since 1950, the Straights of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba were opened to Israeli trade and Israeli cargo went unmolested for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades.</b> Afterwards, Egypt became a convenient destination to smuggle Israeli goods into the rest of the Arab world, as Israeli goods could be legally imported into Egypt and relabeled as Egyptian for trade with other Arab countries, although the treaty led to other Arab countries becoming more suspicious of Egyptian products. By the late 1980s, Israel's counter-measures against the boycott were proving a success, and the Boycott Office estimated that between $750 million to $1 billion worth of Israeli goods, or about 10% of Israel's exports at the time, were reaching Arab markets per year.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{issues have}} closed {{parts of the}} park from time to time. In 1985, the parked was closed to exterminate rats and other pests. In 2005, the park was filled with trees in poor condition, scum in the lakes, and had trash piles in several locations, {{including}} fountains. From that year until 2010, the park was closed section by section for restoration and rehabilitation projects. The first section was closed for eight months in 2005, for work that included dredging lakes, pruning and removing trees, picking up tons of debris, and expelling hundreds of vendors. Shortly thereafter, projects on {{the second and third}} sections of the park began, mostly to control or eliminate rats, feral dogs and cats, pigeons and other introduced species. In 2005, migratory birds began to make a comeback at the park with the eradication and relocation of introduced species such as geese and ducks, which were aggressive to other species. The park hosts more than 100 species of this kind of bird, with some reproducing here for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades.</b> Other native mammals returned in 2005, including the tlacuache and the cacomistle.|$|E
25|$|In Kerr's first year, the Warriors {{finished}} with the best regular season record at 67–15, including an incredible 39–2 mark in home games. Kerr became the winningest rookie head coach in NBA history, passing Tom Thibodeau and his 62 wins with the Chicago Bulls in 2010–11. Point guard Stephen Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season with 286, eclipsing his own record that he set in 2012–13. Curry also won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for the 2014–15 season. He and fellow guard Klay Thompson, together known as the Splash Brothers, finished first and second {{in the league in}} three-pointers made, respectively, and combined to make 525 threes, surpassing their previous league record for a duo by 41, while also converting an impressive 44 percent of those shots. During the season, the backcourt mates both started in the NBA All-Star Game and were each named to the All-NBA team, the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>decades</b> that either has been achieved by guards on the same team. Golden State advanced to the Finals after sweeping the New Orleans Pelicans {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, defeating the Memphis Grizzlies in six games during the second round, and eliminating the Houston Rockets in five games in the conference finals.|$|E
