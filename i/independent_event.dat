Among the earliest events developed by the new organisation was Oireachtas Rince na hÉireann (the All-Ireland Championships), which was first established as an <b>independent</b> <b>event</b> in 1929. It had previously been a component of the Gaelic League's annual Oireachtas cultural festival.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about the impact of {{different}} types of stressful events (for example divorce v. bereavement) on unipolar depression compared with bipolar disorder. Inconsistencies exist concerning the association between <b>independent</b> <b>events</b> (beyond an individual's control, such as bereavement) and bipolar disorder. AIMS: To examine the role of specific, <b>independent</b> and dependent <b>events</b> in mood disorders. METHOD: Life-event information was collected from 512 people with bipolar disorder, 1448 people with unipolar depression and over 600 controls. RESULTS: Various events were associated with unipolar depression and bipolar disorder, but some event specificity was detected. For example, financial crisis was more strongly related to bipolar disorder rather than unipolar depression. <b>Independent</b> <b>events</b> were only related to unipolar depression and not bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The events that were linked to bipolar disorder and unipolar depression were similar. <b>Independent</b> <b>events</b> were not associated with bipolar episodes, suggesting that life stress may be a consequence of, rather than a trigger for, bipolar episodes...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} spatio–temporal scaling {{properties}} of the NCSN California catalogue for the period 1975 – 1995 (about 137 000 events) using a multifractal approach. The study {{is based on a}} new method of declustering earthquake catalogues based on looking for <b>independent</b> <b>events.</b> This technique makes use of the {{properties of the}} multifractal distribution of the inter-event times. A comparison test between our method and the Gardner and KnopoV (GK hereafter) approach reveals that our method produces a catalogue of <b>independent</b> <b>events</b> (monofractal Poissonian catalogue), while the GK declustered catalogue remains multifractal. The main diVerence lies in the assumption that the events can be considered to be correlated at large distances. The spatial properties of the declustered catalogue reveal a distribution of epicentres that is more complex than the distribution for the complete catalogue. We suggest that such results are very similar to the scaling properties of fully developed turbulence. Key words: declustering, <b>independent</b> <b>events,</b> multifractal. homogeneously, we need a complete spectrum of dimensions...|$|R
