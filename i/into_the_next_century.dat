5|$|Ernst's rule, {{and that}} of his four Wittelsbach successors, {{strengthened}} the position of his family in Imperial politics. The victory of the Catholic party further consolidated the Counter-Reformation in the northwest territories of the Holy Roman Empire, especially in the bishoprics of Münster, Paderborn, Osnabrück and Minden, which were bordered by Protestant territories. Once Ernst's brother or such allies as the Duke of Parma regained control, Jesuits efficiently identified any recalcitrant Protestants and converted them to Catholicism. The Counter-Reformation was thoroughly applied in the lower Rhineland, with the goal that every Protestant, whether Lutheran or Calvinist, would be brought to the Catholic fold. For their efforts, the Spanish acquired important bridgeheads on the Rhine River, securing a land route to the rebellious northern provinces, which helped to extend an already long war of secession well <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|Verdi was {{concerned}} about {{working on a new}} opera at his advanced age, but he yearned to write a comic work and was pleased with Boito's draft libretto. It took the collaborators three years from mid-1889 to complete. Although the prospect of a new opera from Verdi aroused immense interest in Italy and around the world, Falstaff did not prove to be as popular as earlier works in the composer's canon. After the initial performances in Italy, other European countries and the US, the work was neglected until the conductor Arturo Toscanini insisted on its revival at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera in New York from the late 1890s <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century.</b> Some felt that the piece suffered from a lack of the full-blooded melodies of the best of Verdi's previous operas, a view strongly contradicted by Toscanini. Conductors of the generation after Toscanini to champion the work included Herbert von Karajan, Georg Solti and Leonard Bernstein. The work is now part of the regular operatic repertory.|$|E

25|$|While the {{introduction}} of large steamboats and bridge construction had taken business from the Thames watermen, {{the growth of the}} railways took passengers away from the steamboat services {{and the use of the}} river for public transport began a steady decline. River service companies struggled financially, and in 1876 the five main boat companies merged to form the London Steamboat Company. The company ran a half-hourly service from Chelsea to Greenwich for eight years until it went bankrupt in 1884. Nevertheless, river services continued under different management <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century.</b> Many of the Thames paddle steamers around this time were built by the Thames Ironworks at Bow Creek.|$|E
25|$|Plymouth Colony lost {{close to}} {{eight percent of}} its adult male {{population}} and a smaller percentage {{of women and children}} to Indian warfare or other causes associated with the war. Indian losses were much greater, with about 2,000 men killed or who died of injuries in the war, more than 3,000 dying of sickness or starvation, and another 1,000 Indians sold into slavery and transported to other areas, such as the British-controlled islands in the Caribbean. About 2,000 Indians escaped to other tribes to the north or west; they joined continued Indian attacks from those bases well <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century.</b> Historians estimate that, as a result of King Philip's War, the Indian population of southern New England was reduced by about 40 to 80 percent.|$|E
500|$|The film explores {{controversial}} themes such as racism, {{abuse of}} power, and rape. Voyeurism {{is also a}} major element due to the protagonist's extensive use of SQUID technology. The fact that the film was directed by a woman was even more controversial, with film critic Michael Mirasol noting that had Strange Days been directed by a man, these scenes would likely have been criticized as sexist and misogynistic. Nevertheless, Bigelow insisted that the film does not glorify violence {{and that it has}} a positive purpose. According to her, [...] "I wanted to treat 'the system' fairly, because if it's the enemy, then we're the enemy, since by not changing it we're reproducing it...

50|$|A {{reproduction}} of the pyramids that marked the baseline for measurement at Yaruqui (which was destroyed by Quito authorities in the 1740s) was erected in 1836, the centennial of the expedition, by the Rocafuerte administration of the nascent republic of Ecuador. This monument fell <b>into</b> disrepair over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century</b> but was rebuilt in 1936, minus its original French inscription, for the bicentennial of the first geodesic expedition, along with a second pyramid at San Antonio de Pichincha on the Equator.

Though talks of having a mural celebrating the Geodesic Mission took place during planning stages, no acknowledgement of the scientific importance of this site currently exists.|$|R

500|$|Even {{after the}} tracheotomy, Frederick {{continued}} to run high fevers and suffered from headaches and insomnia. His violent coughing continued, bringing up bloody sputum. Apart from Mackenzie, the other doctors, led by Bergmann, now held the firm {{opinion that the}} Crown Prince's disease was cancer {{and that it had}} possibly spread to his lungs. The diagnosis of laryngeal cancer was conclusively confirmed on 6 March, when the anatomist Professor Wilhelm Waldeyer, who had come to San Remo, examined Frederick's sputum under a microscope and confirmed the presence of [...] "so-called cancroid bodies...from a cancerous new growth" [...] that was in the larynx. He further said that there were no signs of any growths in the lungs. Though it finally settled the question, Waldeyer's diagnosis threw all of Mackenzie's treatment of Frederick into doubt.

2500|$|However, the Anglicists also {{included}} utilitarians, led by James Mill, who {{had begun to}} play an important role in fashioning Company policy. [...] The utilitarians believed in the moral worth of an education that aided the good of society and promoted instruction in useful knowledge. [...] Such useful instruction to Indians had the added consequence of making them more suitable for the Company's burgeoning bureaucracy. [...] By the early 1830s, the Anglicists had the upper hand in devising education policy in India. [...] Many utilitarian ideas were employed in Thomas Babbington Macaulay's Minute on Indian Education of 1835.

The French and Indian Wars continued <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century,</b> ending in 1763, by which time the stockade had been extended to the river on the north.

2500|$|Fashion in {{the period}} 1550–1600 in Western European {{clothing}} was characterized by increased opulence. [...] Contrasting fabrics, slashes, embroidery, applied trims, {{and other forms of}} surface ornamentation remained prominent. The wide silhouette, conical for women with breadth at the hips and broadly square for men with width at the shoulders had reached its peak in the 1530s, and by mid-century a tall, narrow line with a V-shaped waist was back in fashion. [...] Sleeves and women's skirts then began to widen again, with emphasis at the shoulder that would continue <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century.</b> [...] The characteristic garment of the period was the ruff, which began as a modest ruffle attached to the neckband of a shirt or smock and grew into a separate garment of fine linen, trimmed with lace, cutwork or embroidery, and shaped into crisp, precise folds with starch and heated irons.|$|E
