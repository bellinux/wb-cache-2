This study looks at <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving</b> in South Africa in general and the trends of its components in particular. It addresses the impacts of internal and external policies on the disaggregated domestic saving in South Africa. This is done with the aim of establishing the channels through which these policies influence the components of South Africa’s domestic saving. This study focuses on current economic literature while examining <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving</b> and its attributes. A brief discussion of <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving</b> on emerging market region puts sub-Saharan Africa’s <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving,</b> particularly that of South Africa, into perspective. Hence, the developments in South Africa’s domestic saving are compared with those of some selected countries. An analysis of <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving</b> in South Africa for the period 1970 to 2004 indicates a long-run downward pattern. The disaggregated domestic saving in South Africa shows that although three components contributed to the decline in South Africa’s domestic saving, the public sector appeared to be the main culprit in the decline. Thus, the net saving by the government had been negative since early 1980. The study observes that the patterns of saving of the three components are influenced by both internal and external factors. iv These internal and external factors are made up of fiscal and monetary policies, and the balance of payments. Without over-emphasising the importance of <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving</b> in any economy, it is crucial for South Africa to encourage a positive saving culture for improvement in meaningful domestic investment for long-term economic growth. This study, therefore, suggests that in a developing economy like the South African economy, a positive saving attitude could be encouraged through the use of internal and external policies. Hence, the positive impact of internal and external factors could motivate all stakeholders in <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving</b> to seize any available opportunity to boost their savings, thereby raising South Africa’s <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} the global financial crisis (GFC) and recent structural changes in the patterns of hoarding international reserves (IR). We confirm that the determinants of IR hoarding evolve with developments in the global economy. During the pre-GFC period of 1999 - 2006, <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> is associated with higher IR in developing and emerging markets. The negative impact of outward direct investment on IR accumulation is consistent with the recent trend of diverting international assets from the international reserve account into tangible foreign assets; the Joneses' effect lends support to the regional rivalry in hoarding IR as a motivation; and commodity price volatility induces precautionary buffer hoarding. During the 2007 2009 GFC period, previously significant variables become insignificant or display the opposite effect, probably reflecting the frantic market conditions driven by financial instability. Nevertheless, the propensity to import and <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> continue to display strong and even larger positive effects on IR holding. The results from the 2010 2012 post-GFC period are dominated by factors that had been mostly overlooked in earlier decades. While the negative effect of swap agreements and the positive effect of <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> on IR holdings are in line with our expectations, we find a change in the link between outward direct investment and IR in the pre- and post-crisis period. The macro-prudential policy tends to complement IR accumulation. Developed countries display different demand behaviors for IRs.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{economic growth}} and productivity, countries often invest {{in research and development}} (R&D). This is often an indicative of a country’s dedication to science and technology. The broader literature suggests that research and development expenditure positively impacts total factor productivity (TFP) by increasing output per worker. However, there are few studies that look at the impact of research and development on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Using a three-year time lag, this study attempted to uncover the relationship between research and development expenditure in 2008 to GDP per capita in 2011. Other factors, including the GINI index, <b>gross</b> <b>savings</b> rate, the unemployment rate, services as value added, industry as value added, and education expenditures in 2011 are also explicitly controlled in the study to isolate the impact of R&D on economic growth. Five ordinary least squares (OLS) models were used to understand how a one percent change in R&D expenditure can impact GDP per capita in both developed and developing countries. The empirical analysis found that R&D expenditure was statistically significant throughout the models tested, and other factors such as <b>gross</b> <b>savings,</b> industry as value added, and services as value added were significant at the one percent level. Ultimately, a positive relationship between GDP per capita in 2011 and R&D expenditures in 2008 was uncovered...|$|E

We confirm that the determining factors of international reserves are evolving with developments in the global economy. From 1999 – 2006, the pre-GFC period, <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> is associated with higher international reserves in developing and emerging markets. An outward direct-investment effect is consistent with the view of diverting international assets from the international reserve account, the “Joneses’ effect” lends support to the rivalry hoarding motivation, and commodity price volatility induces hoarding against uncertainty. During the 2007 – 2009 GFC, those variables became insignificant or displayed the opposite effect, probably reflecting the frantic market conditions that prevent a normal economic relationship to hold. Nevertheless, the propensity to continue to trade displays a strong positive effect. The 2010 – 2012 post-crisis results are dominated by factors that have been mostly overlooked in earlier decades. While the effects of swap agreements and <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> are in line with expectations, we find a change in the link between outward direct investment and international reserves in the pre- and post-crisis period. The macro-prudential policy is found to complement international reserve accumulation. Developed countries display very different demand behaviors for international reserves. Higher <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> has been associated with lower international reserve holding because developed countries are more likely to deploy their savings in the global capital market.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Economics) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 The European {{sovereign}} debt crisis started. in 2008 {{with the collapse}} of Iceland's banking system. Subsequently, several European countries faced the implosion of financial institutions, high government debt and rapidly rising bond yield spreads in government securities. In this context, Greece {{is an example of a}} country whose government debt is a matter of grave concern since it has received the second bailout but still threatens to default. This is ironic since a developed economy like Greece is considered to aide developing economies. The main aim of this dissertation is to conduct an econometric analysis of the determinants of the Greek {{sovereign debt}} crisis while the secondary aim is an extensive literature review of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. Regarding the former aim, the variables selected include the government deficit, current account balance, inflation, <b>gross</b> <b>savings</b> and general government debt of Greece. This annual data (from 1976 to 2010) was collected from the World Development Indicators, European Commission data base and the International Monetary Fund. The Vector Error Correction Model framework was used to estimate our model. Also, the Granger causality analysis helped to identify the direction of causation. Furthermore, the Variance Decomposition and the Generalized Impulse Response Function were employed to analyze the shocks of all our variables on each other. Finally, for the latter aim, we critically review the evolution, causes, consequences and cures of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and then formulate some suggestions on how to mitigate the effects of this crisis. The results of the econometric analysis show that there is a significant negative relationship between general government debt with government deficit and inflation. However, a significant positive relationship between general government debt and current account balance was found. There is an insignificant negative relationship between <b>gross</b> <b>savings</b> and general government debt. The past value of the general government debt and government deficit has the ability to determine the present value of inflation; and in turn, pass value of inflation, can predict the present value of current account balance and <b>gross</b> <b>savings.</b> Variation in most of our variables is highly explained by our variables itself, with the exception of current account balance where variation is explained mostly by general government debt. The response of general government debt to itself is positive. Gross government debt to government deficit and general government debt to current account balance is negative. General government debt to inflation is positive. A shock of gross government debt has an increasing negative effect on <b>gross</b> <b>savings</b> over the study period. Among the causes of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis is the rapid growth of government debt levels, trade imbalances, monetary policy inflexibility, and loss of confidence. Consequences of this crisis involve disrupted bond markets and the banking sector, depreciation of the Euro, reduced economic growth, loss of confidence, reduced remittances and tight fiscal measures. Some measures were taken and many are proposed as a cure for this crisis. This dissertation recommends that policies aimed at decreasing the level of general government debt should increase expenditure hence deficit in an income generating investment, increase inflation while decreasing current account balance.
