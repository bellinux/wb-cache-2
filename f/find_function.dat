This includes his early writings starting in 1910; and his lectures from Marburg University, which lead up to the writing and publication of Sein und Zeit in 1927. This was the period that Martin Heidegger was engaged in the methodology and considerations: Phänomenologische.

40|$|Abstract.

Existence and uniqueness results for {{the solution of the}} time-dependent, three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations are also established. These investigations are based on a theory of extensions of time-dependent, solenoidal vector fields that is developed in this paper. The results of this paper are indispensable to the study of optimal control problems with boundary control for the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Incremental clone {{detection}} {{is designed}} to efficiently find only those clones that cross between a previous version of a system and a new version in order to update a previous clone analysis. If we instead use a different system as the new version, then {{it can be used}} to find only those clones that cross between two different systems. Live scatterplots are a visualization technique that helps localize clones quickly using pop-up information directly from points in the scatterplot. In this paper we explore how these two can be used together to rapidly expose and analyze similarities between two different systems at several levels of abstraction. Using the NiCad incremental clone detector, we <b>find</b> <b>function</b> clones between two recent versions of Linux and FreeBSD, analyze the nature and causes of some of these similarities in detail, and compare our observations with the earlier study of token-sequence clone...|$|E

40|$|Document {{delivery}} bridges the {{gap between}} where the customer is and where the document is. Libraries have to offer user-friendly access to hybrid collections, and design and implement document delivery mechanisms from paper originals to provide a seamless integration between delivery from electronic and paper articles. Apart from improved service, a document delivery service provider could benefit internally from rationalising and automating the logistics of the delivery process. This article analyses the document delivery process, starting by defining five requirements for document delivery. By looking at document delivery from both the customer's and the organisation's perspective, the real needs of the customer are defined. From a basic distinction between the search and <b>find</b> <b>function</b> and the order and receive functions, the internal logistics of document delivery are analysed. The DocUTrans document delivery concept and system as used in Delft show how its implementation improves the whole system. The analysis itself can be highly beneficial.

40|$|We {{consider}} the image interpolation problem where given an image vm,n with uniformly-sampled pixels vm,n and point spread function h, {{the goal is}} to <b>find</b> <b>function</b> u(x,y) satisfying vm,n = (h*u) (m,n) for all m,n in Z. This article improves upon the IPOL article Image Interpolation with Contour Stencils. In the previous work, contour stencils are used to estimate the image contours locally as short line segments. This article begins with a continuous formulation of total variation integrated over a collection of curves and defines contour stencils as a consistent discretization. This discretization is more reliable than the previous approach and can effectively distinguish contours that are locally shaped like lines, curves, corners, and circles. These improved contour stencils sense more of the geometry in the image. Interpolation is performed using an extension of the method described in the previous article. Using the improved contour stencils, there is an increase in image quality while maintaining similar computational efficiency...|$|E

For {{the past thirty years}} his ideas have been explained, explored and amplified by thousands of others, with varying results. Jung Lexicon takes the reader to the source. It was designed for those seeking an understanding of relevant terms and concepts as they were used by Jung himself. There are choice extracts from Jung's Collected Works, but no references to other writers. Jung Lexicon is not a critique or a defence of Jung's thoughts, but a guide to its richness and an illustration of the broad scope and interrelationship of his interests. Informed by a close reading of Jung's major writings, Jung Lexicon contains a comprehensive overview of the basic principles of Jungian psychology. The implications and practical application of Jung's ideas are well covered by other volumes in this series.
