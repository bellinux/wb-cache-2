50|$|<b>Hypergeusia</b> is a taste {{disorder}} {{where the}} sense is abnormally heightened. It can {{be associated with}} a lesion of the posterior fossa and Addison's Disease; where a patient will crave for salty and sour taste due to the abnormal loss of ions with urine.|$|E
50|$|Chronic low-grade trauma due to parafunctional habits (e.g. {{rubbing the}} tongue against the teeth or {{pressing}} {{it against the}} palate), may be involved. BMS {{is more common in}} persons with Parkinson's disease, so {{it has been suggested that}} it is a disorder of reduced pain threshold and increased sensitivity. Often people with BMS have unusually raised taste sensitivity, termed <b>hypergeusia</b> ("super tasters"). Dysgeusia (usually a bitter or metallic taste) is present in about 60% of people with BMS, a factor which led to the concept of a defect in sensory peripheral neural mechanisms. Changes in the oral environment, such as changes in the composition of saliva, may induce neuropathy or interruption of nerve transduction. The onset of BMS is often spontaneous, although it may be gradual. There is sometimes a correlation with a major life event or stressful period in life. In women, the onset of BMS is most likely three to twelve years following menopause.|$|E
