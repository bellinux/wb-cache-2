40|$|Low {{impedance}} of {{the return}} current path and small loop area of return current loop are best practices design criteria to minimise electromagnetic emission from a high speed printed circuit board (PCB). In high-speed digital circuit, the high-frequency return current signal will find its {{way back to the}} source by flowing along the path of least inductance. It can either flows over the ground plane or on the guard trace which is physically close proximity to the highspeed signal trace. It is important to indicate that the use of guard trace {{can be one of the}} options of emission reduction techniques on <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> assemblies as it will reduce the emission level. In this paper, several <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> test <b>boards</b> were developed to evaluate the impact of different return current paths on radiated emission conducted in a Gigahertz Transverse Electromagnetic (GTEM) cell.

40|$|Transport of {{commercial}} broiler chickens {{from the farm}} to the processing plant is perceived to compromise welfare under some circumstances. Research has been conducted using European standard equipment to characterize the environment experienced by poultry during broiler transport. In contrast no studies have been reported on the environment experienced by broilers under United States standard industry practices during transport. Moreover, microenvironment temperatures within industry trailers have not been reported. The present study characterized the thermal micro-environment experienced by broiler chickens during transport across different seasons. The temperatures were influenced by temperature mitigation practices (plastic wrap, <b>double</b> <b>side</b> <b>board,</b> single <b>side</b> <b>board,</b> open <b>side,</b> and heat mitigation) and by ambient temperatures. Temperatures measured within transporters {{were found to have}} less variation compared to studies using other transport systems. Temperatures were found to decrease (p= 0. 05) for the second half of transport duration during low ambient conditions (- 16. 4 to 2. 80 0 C). For moderate ambient conditions (6. 22 to 23. 35 0 C) significant (p= 0. 05) yet small (3 ̆c 2 oC) changes in temperature were seen. For transport within high ambient temperature ranges (29. 05 to 40. 14 0 C) an increase (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in temperature was seen from the first to second half of transport duration. While temperature mitigation practices do provide improved thermal environments compared to that of ambient conditions, improvements are still needed. Further research is needed to develop new mitigation practices at high (29. 05 to 40. 14 0 C) and low (- 16. 4 to 2. 80 0 C) ambient temperatures. Research is also needed to expand current indexes that consider the effects of temperature, humidity, air velocity, and duration to ensure welfare is not compromised by the transport environments experienced by poultry...|$|R
40|$|Signal {{or power}} to ground traces on {{a printed circuit}} board (PCB) of digital {{products}} may act as an efficient loop antenna radiating magnetic field when the length is greater than the wavelength of the high frequency current. Employment of proper routing of the return current path, filtering and damping resistor is best practices in the design criteria to minimise sources of electromagnetic emission at PCB level. It is important to indicate that the use of guard traces, filtering at supply network of critical component and damping resistor on signal traces can be the options of emission reduction techniques on <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> assemblies as it will reduce the emission level. In this paper, three <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> test <b>boards</b> are developed to evaluate the impact of the aforementioned mitigation methods on near magnetic field emission. The magnetic field distributions over each layout are measured in order to reveal the profile of radiation to gain further understanding on the net current distribution on the traces of the digital circuit. It is seen that by proper design of return current path, the magnetic field is reduced by average of 16. 5 dB...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} {{development of}} a radiation tolerant, low power, reconfigurable avionics module aimed at meeting the avionics needs of the JPL Micro-Inspector spacecraft. This module represents a complete avionics system, consisting of two PowerPC 405 CPUs embedded within a reconfigurable FPGA fabric of over 8 Million logic gates, 64 MB of EDAC protected Flash storage and 128 MB of EDAC protected DDR SDRAM or SDRAM memories, along with FPGA SEU mitigation logic, and all necessary power conversion.

5000|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} {{the first}} microprocessor based delay box timer {{was introduced by}} Richard Beutnagel (Thorn Microsystems in Rochester, NY). Richard Beutnagel's design also used a quartz crystal time base for accuracy but without the TTL glue logic. The Thorn Microsystems unit utilized a single chip microcomputer from Intel, a professionally fabricated <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> printed circuit <b>board</b> with plated through holes, large BCD thumbwheel switches, and rugged solid state bipolar output circuitry (no electromechanical relay). The Thorn Microsystems design reduced parts count to [...] "one chip" [...] and one power transistor substantially reduced PCB (printed circuit board) solder interconnections for a significant enhancement in reliability. The firmware embedded within the Intel microcontroller chip performed all the timing and control functions required of the delay box with quartz crystal digital accuracy.|$|R
40|$|This system {{replaces the}} analog {{speedometer}} and tachometer gauge cluster of a 750 cc Honda motorcycle with a computerized monitor {{system based on}} the INTEL 8085 A microprocessor and family of peripherals. The system adds the enhanced functionality of engine temperature, battery charging, fuel level, turn signal, and kick stand monitoring and status display. A security function is also employed as a guard against unauthorized use or theft. The speedometer and tachometer functions utilize phototransistor sensors generating pulses derived from stock cable connections to the engine block and front wheel. The engine temperature, fuel level, and battery charging functions are implemented via A/D conversion of external sensor inputs. Turn signal and kick stand status functions are implemented by software polling of external switches. The system incorporates a small keyboard for input of a five digit security code. If the code input is correct, ignition is enabled and normal operation may follow. If the code input is incorrect, ignition is disabled, and the motorcycle horn is activated as an alarm. The operator is allowed two attempts at entrance of the five digit code. All system functions are displayed via various configurations of 7 -segment and discrete LED displays for operator feedback. The system utilizes the twelve volt motorcycle power source and is contained on three <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> circuit <b>boards.</b> The system software was developed on the INTEL SDK 85 system design prototype kit and transferred in final form to an on-board EPROM...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: This {{research}} {{attempts to}} optimize the parameters for pulse plating of silver on printed circuit board. The idea here is to use pulse plating technique which is metal deposition by pulsed electrolysis method. Approach: Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) {{plays a major role}} in all communication and electronics industry. Silver is a ductile and malleable metal which has 7 % higher conductivity than copper. Here the electro deposit is influenced by current density, silver concentration in the bath, applied current type. Pulse plating technique is used in <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> printed circuit <b>board</b> especially in the case of plated through hole technique. Here exist a necessity to do plating which will deposit a metal wall in the substrate and it will connect between the components. Results: This method of pulse plating proves that it avoids the disadvantage of rough deposition that is caused due to DC plating in PCB's. Conclusion: The surface morphology and the grain size is measured using XRD analysis and it proves that the number of pin holes is reduced...|$|R
40|$|A novel gaseous {{two-dimensional}} {{imaging detector}} "Micro Pixel Chamber (micro-PIC) " has been developed. This detector {{is based on}} <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> printed circuit <b>board</b> (PCB). We have developed large area (10 cm x 10 cm) micro-PICs with 65536 pixel anodes of 400 um pitch on a 100 um thick insulating substrate. Achieved energy resolution was 30 % (FWHM) at 5. 9 keV, and a gas gain of 7000 was obtained with argon ethane (8 : 2) gas mixture. This gain is high enough to detect minimum ionizing particles with such a small electrode pitch. Although several discharges occurred during 65 hours continuous operation, the detectors have kept stable operation with high gain. The micro-PIC is a useful detector for many applications e. g. X-ray, gamma ray, and charged particle imaging. The micro electrode structure allows us to measure directions of primary electrons due to incident X-rays or gamma rays, which provide a strong method for X-ray polarimetry and gamma-ray imaging.

40|$|We have {{successfully}} synthesized highly dense and well aligned zinc oxide nanowires (NWs) {{on the two}} sides of a PEDOT: PSS substrate by a single step low temperature hydrothermal method. The grown sample was used to fabricate a <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> piezoelectric nanogenerator (NG). The maximum harvested output power density from the fabricated <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> NG configuration was about 4. 44 mW cm(- 2). The results obtained from the present <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> NG were approximately double the output from a single side. In addition to that, the voltage polarity of the harvested voltage from {{the two sides of}} the NG has been investigated. The results showed that upon bending, an anisotropic voltage polarity is generated on the two sides. Indicating that, this <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> NG can be used as a self-powered voltage polarity based direction sensor.
