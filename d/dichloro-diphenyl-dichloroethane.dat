Glucocorticoid {{deficiency}} produced in dogs by chronic administration of <b>dichloro-diphenyl-dichloroethane</b> (o,pâ€™-DDD) was demonstrated by decreased plasma 17 -OH-corticosteroids (17 -OHCS), abolition of ACTH-induced increase of 17 -OHCS and ACTH-induced decrease of eosinophils. Plasma Na+, K+ and volume {{and blood pressure}} and heart rate were unaltered. After 2 weeks of treatment with DDD the dogs were anesthetized for experimentation. Blood pressure and heart contractile force and rate responses to graded doses of epinephrine and norepinephrine were determined in one series of treated dogs and were compared to those in untreated dogs. As a final test, cardiac contractile force response to ouabain was determined in most dogs. Cardioaccelerator and vasopressor responses to the amines and cardiac contractile force responses to ouabain were similar in treated and untreated dogs. However, the positive inotropic effect of high doses of amines was depressed in treated dogs. Administration of prednisolone for 3 days reversed these effects of DDD...|$|E
40|$|Samples {{of surface}} {{sediment}} and shellfish {{were collected from}} Minjiang Estuary-Mazu and Xiamen-Jinmen sea areas and were analyzed for hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyl-trichlorophenyl (DDT) and its degraded derivatives <b>dichloro-diphenyl-dichloroethane</b> (DDT) and dichloro-dichlorophenyl-ethylene (DDE), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by gas chromatography. Concentration ranges of HCHs, DDTs, and PCBs in the sediments were 0. 03 - 0. 48, 1. 10 - 14. 3, and ND to 0. 76 ng/g dw, respectively; those for shellfish samples were ND to 1. 5, 21. 5 - 892, dw and ND- 3. 7 ng/g dw, respectively. The {{results showed that the}} concentrations of such oganochlorine compounds (OCs) in the sediments were usually low as compared with other sea areas and estuaries, and the organochlorines were accumulated in marine bivalve mollusks, particularly in oyster. With respect to the concentrations of HCHs, DDTs, and PCBs in the samples of either sediment or shellfish, DDTs were higher than HCHs and PCBs. The concentrations of OCs in shellfish samples varied with the sampling locations and organism species but were generally higher than those in the sediments. The concentration distributions, compositions, and residue levels of these OCs are extensively discussed and evaluated...|$|E
