In first gear, at a speed of a few km/h, the minimal turning radius was 3.44 m. In neutral gear, the tracks could be turned in opposite directions, so the Tiger I pivoted in place. There was a steering wheel instead of either a tiller — or, as most tanks had at that time, twin braking levers — making the Tiger I's steering system easy to use, and ahead of its time.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of active car safety systems on driver‘s behavior in emergency situations, i. e. <b>emergency</b> braking, <b>steering</b> angle, etc. Several models of real vehicles have been tested in order to analyse the ABS and ESP systems operation efficiency. The results of emergency braking and stability in real vehicle testing with ABS and ESP stability control systems switched on and off are presented in detail. In {{order to get the}} maximum impact of ABS and ESP systems (full activated) the real vehicles were tested on the asphalt paved road covered with wet snow. Tests were also carried out on the road sections with different pavement and state. The XL Meter Pro Beta measurement device was used for the real vehicle testing. The brakes and active safety systems of the vehicles have been tested for their effectiveness at different conditions: when the vehicle is braking on horizontal wet asphalt, and on an icy gravel surface, at a different initial running speed: 40 km/h, 70 km/h and 100 km/h. During the real vehicle testing the stability during emergency braking resulted in the assessment of influence of active safety systems on handling the vehicle and its stability, and the driver‘s behaviour in emergency situations i. e. on a slippery road, or at sharp steering angle. The results of real vehicle testing have been presented in the paper in the form of charts. Examination of a vehicle emergency braking and stability systems results in the conclusions concerned with handling of the vehicle ad application of the above systems...|$|R
50|$|Standard {{active safety}} {{features}} also include electronically controlled braking (ECB), anti-lock brakes (ABS), and traction control (TRAC). The stability/traction control system, Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) (with disable button), incorporates Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB), Anti-Lock Brakes (ABS), Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Traction Control (TRC) and Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) {{active safety systems}} with the Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS), Electric Power Steering (EPS) and Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS) systems. VDIM integrates these systems to improve vehicle responsiveness to driver input and prevent loss of control. An <b>Emergency</b> <b>Steering</b> Assist system acts to minimize body roll and improve vehicle responsiveness in sudden maneuvers. This system reduces the steering gear ratio and prompts the suspension to adopt stiffer settings, helping make emergency maneuvers more stable and controlled. Passive safety features include eight to ten standard airbags (depending on model, up to eleven with upgraded rear seats), passenger detection systems, front and rear crumple zones, three-point seatbelts with pretensioners and force limiters, and a reinforced steel body. Dual-stage driver and twin-chambered front passenger airbags, front knee airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, and Thorax-Abdomen-Pelvis (TAP) airbags are also installed.|$|E
5000|$|While Trumpeter was {{completing}} outfitting at New York Navy Yard {{only three}} days after her commissioning, sparks from a workman's burner set off a small fire on a line between the dock and the port side of the ship. An alert fire watch at the scene quickly extinguished the fire, and damage to the new destroyer escort was averted. On the 28th, she underwent dock trials and deperming and finished the month with underway trials in New York Harbor. Early in November, Trumpeter departed New York, setting her course for Bermuda. She moored in Port Royal Bay on the 6th and in the following weeks participated in extensive shakedown and indoctrination exercises. Antisubmarine tactics, convoy escort technique, gunnery, night illumination, cruising and screening exercises occupied her days. Each evening, she returned to Bermuda to anchor in Great Sound. Antisubmarine runs, practice fueling at sea, towing, mail-passing and <b>emergency</b> <b>steering</b> drills readied the new destroyer escort and her crew for the rigors of wartime Atlantic operations. At last, on 2 December, Trumpeter got underway for New York where she underwent alterations and voyage repairs. On 16 December, she departed New York and set her course northeast. The same day, she moored at Naval Air Station Quonset Point and reported for temporary duty with the Antisubmarine Development Detachment, Atlantic Fleet (ASDEVLANT). There she took part in testing newly developed antisubmarine gear until 17 January when she departed Narragansett Bay for New York. After repairs {{to one of her}} main propulsion generators, she resumed her duties at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, remaining there until 13 February when she detached from ASDEVLANT and made way for New York. Following routine upkeep, she got underway with Task Group (TG) 27.2 on the 20th, steaming southward with two escort carriers and two destroyer escorts, bound for Brazil.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHuman body models (HBMs) for vehicle {{occupant}} simulations {{have recently been}} extended with active muscles and postural control strategies. Feedback control {{has been used to}} model occupant responses to autonomous braking interventions. However, driver postural responses during driver initiated braking differ greatly from autonomous braking. In the present study, an anticipatory postural response was hypothesized, modelled in a whole-body HBM with feedback controlled muscles, and validated using existing volunteer data. The anticipatory response was modelled as a time dependent change in the reference value for the feedback controllers, which generates correcting moments to counteract the braking deceleration. The results showed that, in 11 m/s 2 driver braking simulations, including the anticipatory postural response reduced the peak forward displacement of the head by 100 mm, of the shoulder by 30 mm, while the peak head flexion rotation was reduced by 18 °. The HBM kinematic response was within a one standard deviation corridor of corresponding test data from volunteers performing maximum braking. It was concluded that the hypothesized anticipatory responses can be modelled by changing the reference positions of the individual joint feedback controllers that regulate muscle activation levels. The addition of anticipatory postural control muscle activations appears to explain the difference in occupant kinematics between driver and autonomous braking. This method of modelling postural reactions {{can be applied to the}} simulation of other driver voluntary actions, such as <b>emergency</b> avoidance by <b>steering...</b>|$|R
40|$|Child {{safety in}} {{vehicles}} has improved over time. One {{of the main}} factors {{is due to the}} increased restraint use by children. Nevertheless, studies show that although children are restrained, injuries still occur indicating that restraint systems have the potential for further improvement. This thesis focuses on emergency events that may precede a crash, and how these events influence the kinematics of child occupants restrained by a three point seatbelt. Real world data was analyzed and the results identified that a substantial portion of drivers attempted an avoidance maneuver prior to crash. Volunteer tests were carried out to investigate children’s motion during <b>emergency</b> braking and <b>steering</b> maneuvers in a passenger vehicle, and the current child crash test dummies were evaluated with respect to child occupants. In addition, a countermeasure was evaluated by activating an electrical reversible seatbelt retractor (pre-pretensioner) prior to run-off road events with child crash test dummies. The results of the volunteer tests emphasize the need for considering large areas of the vehicle’s interior as part of potential head impact surface. Maximum forward excursion is influenced by initial shoulder belt position and type of booster used in the braking events. A steering maneuver is an unstable restraint situation for children in the rear seat and a great variety in lateral displacement and seatbelt position on the shoulder were seen in different restraint configurations. Influencing factors include child age, anthropometry, initial seated posture and initial shoulder belt position on the shoulder. This thesis confirms that children can be exposed to sub-optimal postures due to emergency events. It provides evidence that a pre-pretensioner has considerable potential in maintaining different sizes of rear-seated occupants well restrained. The braking and steering maneuvers with child volunteers carried out in this thesis provide novel and unique knowledge of possible pre-crash postures of children across a variety of restraint systems in vehicle emergency maneuvers. Test tools are needed to better replicate the real world seated postures and injury causation scenarios. This thesis evaluated the available physical child test tools in low acceleration conditions when exposed to emergency events and highlighted the limitations in capturing child kinematics in emergency events with existing crash test dummies. Extending previous research, this thesis has resulted in deeper knowledge of how children are affected by emergency events prior to crash, in terms of quantifying the frequency of vehicle maneuvers in real world data, measuring the kinematics of children and child crash test dummies in these scenarios and exploring a possible countermeasure to improve safety. The output has the potential to positively impact child safety in cars through the development of active safety systems, enhanced rear seat restraints, and improved test methods and test tools...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the high}} number road traffic related {{fatalities}} of VRU (Vulnerable Road Users) in the EU, {{it is necessary to}} improve the performance of the AEB (Autonomous Emergency Brake) systems. This thesis covers the pre-stage of the AEB-sensor development, from the pre-study of different European accident databases to get a better understanding of which type of accidents are the most common and which cases are the most severe, to the Naturalistic Driving Study performed in Barcelona, to record a big amount of critical situations between the driver and the VRU. The Naturalistic Driving Study was performed with a vehicle equipped with a Lidar (Light Detection And Ranging), two cameras, CAN (Controller Area Network) -system information and a VBOX.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify and compare the kinematics and shoulder belt position of child anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) during <b>emergency</b> <b>steering</b> maneuvers. Furthermore, the ATDs were compared to the results from child volunteers aged 4 to 12 in the same test setup (Bohman, Stockman, et al. 2011). Methods: A driving study was conducted on a test track comprising 4 ATDs: the Q 6, Q 10, and Hybrid III (HIII) 6 - and 10 -year-old ATDs restrained in the rear seat of a passenger vehicle. The ATDs were exposed to 2 repeated steering maneuvers in each restraint system. The Q 6 and HIII 6 -year-old were restrained on booster cushions as well as high-back booster seats. The Q 10 and HIII 10 -year-old were restrained on booster cushions or restrained by 3 -point seat belts directly on the seat. Lateral motion of the forehead and upper sternum was determined, as well as shoulder belt movement on shoulder and torso tilting angle. Results: All ATDs began to move approximately at the same point in time corresponding to a vehicle lateral acceleration of just below 0. 2 g. In the later phase of the maneuver, Q 10 had moved 26 percent less than the children when restrained by seat belt only and 35 percent less when on a booster cushion. Corresponding numbers for the HIII 10 -year-old were 43 and 44 percent higher than for children. Compared to children, the Q 6 had moved 34 percent less when restrained on a high-back booster seat and 31 percent less when on a booster cushion. Corresponding numbers for HIII 6 -year-old were 7 and 28 percent higher than for children. Due to extensive variety of lateral displacements observed in the children, child performance range covers both ATD families for the evaluated sizes of 6 - and 10 -year-old ATDs. Conclusions: Compared to children, the HIII ATDs were closer with regards to mean values in the initial phase of the maneuver and the Q ATDs were closer in the end of the ramping phase of the lateral acceleration. The question regarding which ATD replicates better the behavior of children exposed to steering maneuvers still remains open. As shown in this study, it depends on the focus of the comparison and on what phase of the maneuver is of interest. This study provides valuable knowledge on how representative the current ATDs are for replicating potential precrash postures of children as a result of vehicle <b>emergency</b> <b>steering</b> maneuvers for a variety of restraint systems and ATD sizes...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{collision}} avoidance (CA) systems are an intensive research topic since {{the majority of}} all traffic accidents are collisions that are caused due to inattention or unadjusted driving behaviour of the driver.

The report sets out the activity levels {{in each of}} the hospitals and also outlines the steady increase in demand over the past number of years. I welcome the inclusion in this report of all nine acute hospitals in the region by the addition of Accident and Emergency activity statistics for Naas General Hospital, St Michael's Hospital and St Columcille's Hospital. The increasing demands experienced by the service have placed great pressure on nurses and doctors who staff the Accident and Emergency Departments and I would like to place on record the thanks and appreciation of the Steering Group for the dedicated commitment which staff have displayed throughout the year, often in extremely difficult circumstances. On behalf of the Steering Group I would-also like-to acknowledge the commitment of the Chief Ambulance Officer and all the Ambulance and Control personnel for-their co-operation in co-ordinating the equitable distribution of the emergency work-load throughout the six hospitals during-the year. The report details the challenges posed to hospital services by the ageing profile {{of the population of the}} region. Greater longevity can be seen as a result of healthier lifestyles and better living conditions and also reflects the improved community support now available in helping to maintain older people for as long as possible in their own home environment This does mean however, that when hospitalised, older people are more ill and more heavily dependent, and as a consequence require greater lengths of stay in an acute hospital setting: This in turn means there is an increasing requirement for the service to respond appropriately to the continuing needs of patients following the acute phase of their medical treatment thereby helping to maximise the more efficient use of the acute hospital bed resource. It will be noted from the report that significant numbers of older patients who have completed the acute phase of their medical treatment continue to inappropriately occupy acute hospital beds, despite the additional financial and physical resources which have been put in place in the last number of years.
