40|$|Thrust bearing {{model is}} {{developed}} for fluid flow calculation and for determi-nation of bearing integral characteristics {{in the presence}} of sliding surfaces closure and shaft angular displacements. The model is based on the coupled solution of the problem of incompressible fluid flow between the sliding surfaces and the problem of bearing and shaft elements deformation under the action of the fluid film pressure. Verification of the bearing model results is carried out by the comparison versus the fluid flow calculation results obtained by STAR-CD software and the experimental and theoretical results represented in the certain literature. Thrust bearing charac-teristics are determined versus sliding surfaces closure and rotating <b>disk</b> (<b>runner)</b> angular displacements. The contribution of the sliding surfaces deformations into bearing integral characteristics is estimated. 1...|$|E
