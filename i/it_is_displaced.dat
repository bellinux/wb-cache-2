5000|$|In {{proof of}} their second proposition, Æquiprobabilists quote the same axiom: in pari delicto melior est conditio possidentis.

50|$|A Primary Knock-on Atom or PKA is an atom that is {{displaced}} from its lattice site by irradiation; it is, by definition, the first atom that an incident particle encounters in the target.

5000|$|Some {{academics}} dispute any indigenous {{origins of}} the mashak; researcher Ander Burton Alter wrote in 2000 that the pipes today played in Garwhal are Scottish Highland bagpipes with one bass and two tenor drones, with no local manufacturer or evidence of existence prior to British rule in 1814. [...] Organologist Anthony Baines, however, described an intermediary development stage wherein Indian musicians imitated the Highland pipe by tying [...] "an extra pipe or two" [...] into their mashak. Similarly, the New Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments (1984) describes the traditional mashak as becoming rare as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>displaced</b> by the Scottish pipes.|$|E
50|$|The U4 small nuclear Ribo-Nucleic Acid (U4 snRNA) is a non-coding RNA {{component}} of the major or U2-dependent spliceosome - a eukaryotic molecular machine involved in the splicing of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). It forms a duplex with U6, and with each splicing round, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>displaced</b> from the U6 snRNA (and the spliceosome) in an ATP-dependent manner, allowing U6 to re-fold and create the active site for splicing catalysis. A recycling process involving protein Brr2 releases U4 from U6, while protein Prp24 re-anneals U4 and U6. The crystal structure of a 5′ stem-loop of U4 in complex with a binding protein has been solved.|$|E
50|$|The hind {{part of the}} body, the opisthosoma, {{consists}} of ten somites. The last tergite (anal operculum) lacks a corresponding sternite, comparable to the telson of horseshoe crabs, scorpions and whip scorpions. The muscles of the opisthosoma mostly seem to regulate the volume and internal pressure of the body fluid. The openings of the respiratory system, the spiracles or stigmata, are located {{on the sides of}} the second somite. While the genital opening, the gonopore, derives from the second opisthosomal somite in all arachnids, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>displaced</b> between the fourth pair of legs in harvestmen, thus appearing to be part of the prosoma. The ovipositor of females or penis of males is withdrawn into the first opisthosomal somite.|$|E

50|$|Another related issue {{involves}} the use of full-power stations to carry automated or satellite-originated programming. Any new full-service station can displace an existing low-power translator or an independent LPFM station; regulations allow this on the presumption that the full-service broadcaster {{would be more likely to}} provide a local voice to the community of license. Not all full-service broadcasters live up to this expectation. In some cases (such as the displacement of existing National Public Radio repeaters by newly created religious stations in Lake Charles, Louisiana) the result has been the loss of local or educational content. While an exactly opposite outcome to that which legislative intent had anticipated, often a small non-commercial educational translator was carrying content of higher quality than a satellite-fed full-power station for which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>displaced.</b>|$|E
5000|$|John A. Rassias {{was born}} on August 20, 1925 to Athanathios and Eleni (Leonardakis) Rassias, {{immigrants}} from Georgitsi, Greece. A WWII veteran, Rassias enlisted in the Marines and fought on Okinawa. Rassias later referred to his experience in the war as important to his understanding of how cultural and linguistic understanding connects people of varying backgrounds and experiences. As Rassias states in his upcoming book To Be Human, the Unzipped Mind: “I am born in Manchester, New Hampshire, to a Greek father and Greek mother. Then some buddies and I invade Okinawa. Then I become a teacher...The war has ended... As the Occupation wears on I {{come into contact with}} more and more Japanese. Suspicion and distrust give way gradually to the need to communicate and work with them. I roam over the destroyed city (Sasebo)…The desire to understand the Japanese eventually overcomes the hate we’ve absorbed in our training and in combat, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>displaced</b> by the simple human response of sympathy for the afflicted.

50|$|In essence, {{when the}} wind {{encounters}} a porous obstacle such as a windbreak or shelterbelt, air pressure increases (loosely speaking, air piles up) on the windward side and (conversely) air pressure decreases on the leeward side. As a result, the airstream approaching the barrier is retarded, and a proportion of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>displaced</b> {{up and over the}} barrier, resulting in a jet of higher wind speed aloft. The remainder of the impinging airstream, having been retarded in its approach, now circulates through the barrier to its downstream edge, pushed along by the decrease in pressure across the shelterbelt's width; emerging on the downwind side, that airstream is now further retarded by an adverse pressure gradient, because in the lee of the barrier, with increasing downwind distance air pressure recovers again to the ambient level. The result is that minimum wind speed occurs not at or within the windbreak, nor at its downwind edge, but further downwind - nominally, at a distance of about 3 to 5 times the windbreak height H. Beyond that point wind speed recovers, aided by downward momentum transport from the overlying, faster-moving stream. From the perspective of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations these effects can be understood as resulting from the loss of momentum caused by the drag of leaves and branches and would be represented by the body force fi (a distributed momentum sink).|$|E

50|$|Usually, {{the mirror}} of a liquid mirror {{telescope}} is rotated around two axes simultaneously. For example, {{the mirror of}} a telescope {{on the surface of}} the Earth rotates at a speed of a few revolutions per minute about a vertical axis to maintain its parabolic shape, and also at a speed of one revolution per day about the Earth's axis because of the rotation of the Earth. Usually (except if the telescope is located at one of the Earth's poles), the two rotations interact so that, in a frame of reference that is stationary relative to the local surface of the Earth, the mirror experiences a torque about an axis that is perpendicular to both rotation axes, i.e. a horizontal axis aligned east-west. Since the mirror is liquid, it responds to this torque by changing its aim direction. The point in the sky at which the mirror is aimed is not exactly overhead; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>displaced</b> slightly to the north or south. The amount of the displacement depends on the latitude, the rotation speeds, and the parameters of the telescope's design. On the Earth, the displacement is small, typically a few arcseconds, which can, nevertheless, be significant in astronomical observations. If the telescope were in space, rotating to produce artificial gravity, the displacement could be much larger, possibly many degrees. This would add complexity to the operation of the telescope.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} the Stefan flow occurs when a droplet of liquid evaporates in air. In this case, the vapor/air mixture {{surrounding}} the droplet is the flowing fluid, and liquid/vapor boundary of the droplet is the interface. As heat is absorbed by the droplet from the environment, some of the liquid evaporates into vapor at {{the surface of the}} droplet, and flows away from the droplet as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>displaced</b> by additional vapor evaporating from the droplet. This process causes the flowing medium {{to move away from the}} droplet at some mean speed that is dependent on the evaporation rate and other factors such as droplet size and composition. In addition to this mean flow, a concentration gradient must exist in the neighborhood of the droplet (assuming an isolated droplet) since the flowing medium is mostly air far from the droplet and mostly vapor near the droplet. This gradient causes Fickian diffusion that transports the vapor away from the droplet and the air towards it, with respect to the mean flow. Thus, in the frame of the droplet, the flow of vapor away from the droplet is faster than for the pure Stefan flow, since diffusion is working in the same direction as the mean flow. However, the flow of air away from the droplet is slower than the pure Stefan flow, since diffusion is working to transport air back towards the droplet against the Stefan flow. Such flow from evaporating droplets is important in understanding the combustion of liquid fuels such as diesel in internal combustion engines, and in the design of such engines. The Stefan flow from evaporating droplets and subliming ice particles also plays prominently in meteorology as it influences the formation and dispersion of clouds and precipitation.|$|E
