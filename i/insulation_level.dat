One such data source is the seldom used UK Energy Saving Trust׳s Homes Energy Efficiency Database (HEED), which this paper investigates using Norfolk UK local authorities as a case study. The HEED׳s reactive and longitudinal data collection strategies contribute to underlying biases, which is the likely reasoning for its differences with the English Housing Survey and UK 2001 Census. These differences had a cascading effect in that they manifested themselves in the indicative financial and carbon assessments undertaken. Similarly, sampling concerns also implicated correlations surrounding influences of current dwelling <b>insulation</b> <b>levels.</b> Providing one is transparent about potential biases and data concerns, the HEED can play a substantial role in guiding policy decisions and understanding dwelling stock characteristics (e. g. what makes dwellings ‘Hard to Treat׳).

The main goal of this article is to perform a comprehensive energy and environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) of the roof retrofit of a Portuguese single-family house integrating thermal dynamic simulation. A life-cycle model was developed to assess 27 alternative retrofit scenarios combining three types of insulation material (rock wool, extruded polystyrene and polyurethane foam), three <b>insulation</b> <b>levels</b> (40, 80 and 120 mm) and three types of frame material (wood, light steel and lightweight concrete). The functional unit selected for this study was 1 square meter of living area over a period of 50 years. Life-cycle (LC) impact assessment results were calculated for six categories showing that wood scenarios had the lowest impacts (all categories). The use phase accounted for 60 – 70 % of the LC impacts in all categories. The results also showed that for insulation thicknesses of 80 mm or more, the reduction in operational energy, due to a further increase of 40 mm, is not significant (5 % or less), while the embodied impacts increase from 6 to 20 %.

The minimization of suitably defined performance indices, which relate the failures caused by lightning in a transmission line to both line <b>insulation</b> <b>level</b> and tower footing resistance, is aimed. Optimum values for both line <b>insulation</b> <b>level</b> and tower footing resistance are calculated. The method is applied on several operating Hellenic transmission lines of 150 and 400 kV, respectively, carefully selected among others, due to their high failure rates during lightning thunderstorms. Special {{attention has been paid}} on open loop lines, where a possible failure could bring the system out of service causing significant problems. The obtained design parameters, which reduce the failure rates caused by lightning, are compared with the existing design parameters of the transmission lines leading up to useful conclusions. The proposed optimization method can be proved a valuable tool to the studies of electric power systems designers, intending to reduce the failure rates caused by lightning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
