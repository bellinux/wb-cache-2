5|$|Barry Kenneth Williams (1944 â€“ 24 December 2014), {{known since}} 1994 as Harry Street, was a British spree killer. A foundry worker {{who lived with}} his parents, he shot eight people in the English Midlands towns of West Bromwich and Nuneaton {{in the space of}} little over an hour on 26 October 1978, killing five. Following a {{high-speed}} car chase, he was arrested and in 1979 was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He was detained in high-security hospitals under mental <b>health</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has {{a positive effect on}} the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-19thcentury {{duck rearing}} was {{concentrated}} on the Duck End, but by the 1860s it had spread to many other towns and villages in the area, particularly Weston Turville and Haddenham. Contamination of Aylesbury's soil by years of duck rearing, and new public <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> which ended many traditional practices, caused {{the decline of the}} duck rearing industry in the Duck End, and by the 1890s the majority of Aylesbury ducks were raised in the villages rather than the town itself. Population shifts and the improved national rail network reduced the need to rear ducks near London, and large duck farms opened in Lancashire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire. Although the number of ducks raised nationwide continued to grow, between 1890 and 1900 the number of ducks raised in the Aylesbury area remained static, and from 1900 it began to drop.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{countries}} {{have some form}} of mental <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> which allows people expressing suicidal thoughts or intent to be detained involuntarily for psychiatric treatment when their judgment is deemed to be impaired. [...] These laws may grant the courts, police, or a medical doctor the power to order an individual to be apprehended to hospital for treatment. [...] This is sometimes referred to as being [...] "committed". The review of ongoing involuntary treatment may be conducted by the hospital, the courts, or a quasi-judicial body, depending on the jurisdiction. Legislation normally requires police or court authorities to bring the individual to a hospital for treatment as soon as practical and not hold them in locations such as a police station.|$|E
2500|$|Industrial {{production}} {{increased significantly}} in the United States during World War II, and industrial accidents soared. Winning the war took precedence over safety, and most labor unions were more concerned with maintaining wages {{in the face of}} severe inflation than with workplace health and safety. After the war ended, however, workplace accident rates remained high and began to rise. [...] In the two years preceding OSHA's enactment, 14,000 workers died each year from workplace hazards, and another 2 million were disabled or harmed. Additionally, the [...] "chemical revolution" [...] introduced a vast array of new chemical compounds to the manufacturing environment. [...] The health effects of these chemicals were poorly understood, and workers received few protections against prolonged or high levels of exposure. While a few states, such as California and New York, had enacted workplace safety as well as workplace <b>health</b> <b>legislation,</b> most states had not changed their workplace protection laws {{since the turn of the}} century.|$|E

60|$|I {{shall not}} be at all {{surprised}} if what I have written above has induced in sympathetic readers a transport of virtuous indignation {{at the expense of}} the medical profession. I shall not damp so creditable and salutary a sentiment; but I must point out that the guilt is shared by all of us. It is not in his capacity of healer and man of science that the doctor vivisects or defends vivisection, but in his entirely vulgar lay capacity. He is made of the same clay as the ignorant, shallow, credulous, half-miseducated, pecuniarily anxious people who call him in when they have tried in vain every bottle and every pill the advertizing druggist can persuade them to buy. The real remedy for vivisection is the remedy for all the mischief that the medical profession and all the other professions are doing: namely, more knowledge. The juries which send the poor Peculiars to prison, and give vivisectionists heavy damages against humane persons who accuse them of cruelty; the editors and councillors and student-led mobs who are striving to make Vivisection one of the watchwords of our civilization, are not doctors: they are the British public, all so afraid to die that they will cling frantically to any idol which promises to cure all their diseases, and crucify anyone who tells them that they must not only die when their time comes, but die like gentlemen. In their paroxysms of cowardice and selfishness they force the doctors to humor their folly and ignorance. How complete and inconsiderate their ignorance is can only be realized by those who have some knowledge of vital statistics, and of the illusions which beset Public <b>Health</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E
60|$|This {{imaginary}} case {{explains the}} actual {{case of the}} sanitary appliances which our local sanitary authorities prescribe today and condemn tomorrow. No sanitary contrivance which the mind of even the very worst plumber can devize could be as disastrous as that total neglect for long periods which gets avenged by pestilences that sweep through whole continents, like the black death and the cholera. If it were proposed {{at this time of}} day to discharge all the sewage of London crude and untreated into the Thames, instead of carrying it, after elaborate treatment, far out into the North Sea, there would be a shriek of horror from all our experts. Yet if Cromwell had done that instead of doing nothing, there would probably have been no Great Plague of London. When the Local Health Authority forces every householder to have his sanitary arrangements thought about and attended to by somebody whose special business it is to attend to such things, then it matters not how erroneous or even directly mischievous may be the specific measures taken: the net result at first is sure to be an improvement. Not until attention has been effectually substituted for neglect as the general rule, will the statistics begin to show the merits of the particular methods of attention adopted. And as we are far from having arrived at this stage, being as to <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> only at the beginning of things, we have practically no evidence yet as to the value of methods. Simple and obvious as this is, nobody seems as yet to discount the effect of substituting attention for neglect in drawing conclusions from health statistics. Everything is put to the credit of the particular method employed, although it may quite possibly be raising the death rate by five per thousand whilst the attention incidental to it is reducing the death rate fifteen per thousand. The net gain of ten per thousand is credited to the method, and made the excuse for enforcing more of it.|$|E

The introductory chapters are about the legislation since 1848 due to reception of the legislation from the Austria-Hungary (often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire in English-language sources). This inherited legislation is mainly about the right of the domicile, health and social care and public health. The authoress divided this thesis into three main chapters about public health care according to timely periods. The main chapters contain subchapters specializing in specific legislation of the individual components of public health.
