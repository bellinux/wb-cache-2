25|$|There {{have been}} two interpretations of Chen's actions during the {{election}} in terms of independence politics. The first {{is that he is}} ideologically committed to advancing Taiwan independence and that his actions are intended to systematically remove the constraints which prevent this from occurring. Seen in this light, his actions are intended to provoke a crisis in which the PRC must either start a war or accept independence, with the expectation that the PRC would back down. Ironically, this interpretation of his actions is shared both among his most fervent supporters (who think it is a good thing) and his most bitter opponents (who think that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing).</b> It is largely to counter this possibility that the PRC has issued statements that it will definitely go to war if certain red lines are crossed. However, they in reality carry little meaning, as Beijing has made such statements warning against electing former President Lee and Chen in the 1996 and 2000 elections, which both failed to materialize. Some people regard these statements now as reverse psychology, as Lee and Chen may help to weaken ROC and advance the unification process.|$|E
500|$|I'm Going to Tell You a Secret {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. O'Brien noted how the film revealed a [...] "strange isolation {{at the cost}} of stardom" [...] from Madonna. She complimented the scenes featuring her father, and the scenes where Madonna was not self-conscious, like when she interacts with her children, talks about her [...] "fat Italian thighs" [...] and also the performance in rain at Dublin. O'Brien criticized other portions of the film, which she said was [...] "affected" [...] by conscious behavior in front of the camera, like backstage parties, poem and piano recitals. Author J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote in his book [...] that the film allowed a much closer look at the singer's family. He was particularly impressed by the scenes featuring Lourdes, believing that she [...] "revealed herself to be sophisticated beyond her years". Kathryn Flett from The Observer newspaper described it as [...] "Fascinating, [...] tiny flashes of insight into her relationship with , which occasionally involve her being just as girlie and ever so slightly insecure as the rest of us." [...] Rupert Smith from The Guardian reported that the director [...] "squeezed every last drop of spectacle from a highly stage-managed performance", but commented that [...] "she gave away far more in 1991's In Bed with Madonna; this time she gave only the illusion of candour". However, he complimented saying [...] "Even the easy-to-mock pre-show prayers brought a tear to the eye. We don't need to be told that 'there's more to life than fame and fortune– something deeper, more profound', or that 'the material world' <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing.</b> But it's good to see an entertainer who, 20 years into her career, is still trying to change the world".|$|E

[...] The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) claimed that Maynard's chosen non-profit, Compassion & Choices had [...] "exploited the illness of Brittany Maynard to promote legalization of doctor prescribed suicide in the states."
