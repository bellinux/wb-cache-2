5|$|A {{character}} named Michael {{was introduced}} in Sister Location, whose identity and motives are currently unknown. The character {{was introduced in}} a cutscene, in which <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to be speaking to his father.|$|E
5|$|Maximus {{continues}} to be the guard's greatest steed in arresting criminals in all of Corona. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> to have feelings for a female horse named Fidel.|$|E
5|$|Although Ravel {{wrote for}} mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and {{mezzo-soprano}} voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade, to be sung by a woman, although a tenor {{voice is a}} permitted alternative in the score.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> troubled. The more {{he inquired}} into our electioneering habits, the less <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to {{understand}} them.|$|R
60|$|There {{was heard}} a loud barking of the dogs below. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> {{disturbed}} by it. She did not notice. Only she thought <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> uneasy.|$|R
60|$|His {{attitude}} toward {{her she could}} not understand. Sometimes <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> anxious to please her, sometimes <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> equally determined that she should understand how inconsequential she was in his life--and always he dominated her.|$|R
5|$|Ann {{is found}} {{some time later}} by the police, {{clutching}} Miles's dead body, but she refuses to speak of what happened until meeting Dr Fisher. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> to accept Ann's story, unconvinced by his own psychosexual explanations of her visions. Fisher is dismayed to see Ann led away by the police, accused of Miles's murder, and he sees Quint's face {{on one of the}} officers. The film closes with a new governess arriving at Bly.|$|E
5|$|Artemis Fowl II– The protagonist; a 12-year-old genius, he {{uses his}} {{intelligence}} to obtain massive wealth through various illegal business ventures; this stems from his family, who have been criminals for generations. While <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> cold and distant at the beginning, his character develops throughout, and he shows remorse, guilt, and passion for his family at the end.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} wakes up each morning during the Adventure mode, Maxwell appears {{over them and}} comments. At first <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> {{impressed}} at the player's hardiness; he then becomes irritated and urges the player to turn back. He offers the player a truce but then becomes completely enraged.|$|E
50|$|Fans {{were shocked}} at his {{decision}} to retire, because <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to be just starting to achieve his outstanding potential, and <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> destined {{to become one of}} the all-time great ruckmen. His retirement created the space for the (then) second-string ruckman Geoff Leek's career to blossom.|$|R
60|$|Again the Professor reflected. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> {{considerably}} disturbed.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> a rough-and-ready, loud-spoken man, withal cordial enough.|$|R
5|$|Gebeachan (died 937), {{also known}} as Gébennach, and Gebechán, was a tenth-century King of the Isles. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> {{to have been a}} {{subordinate}} to Amlaíb mac Gofraid, King of Dublin, and is recorded to have fought and died at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937.|$|E
5|$|Gurnemanz {{knows that}} the Grail draws only the pious to Monsalvat and invites the boy to observe the Grail rite. The youth {{does not know what}} the Grail is, but remarks that as they walk <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to {{scarcely}} move, yet feels as if he is traveling far. Gurnemanz says that in this realm time becomes space ("").|$|E
5|$|Peter of Bruys {{admitted}} the doctrinal {{authority of the}} Gospels in their literal interpretation; the other New Testament writings <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to have considered valueless, as he doubted their apostolic origin. He questioned the Old Testament and rejected {{the authority of the}} Church Fathers and that of the Roman Catholic Church itself. Petrobrusians also opposed clerical celibacy, infant baptism, prayers for the dead, and organ music.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> to {{consider}} the suggestion with perfect seriousness.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{shrugged his}} shoulders. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> very little interested.|$|R
60|$|Hunterleys {{was silent}} for a moment. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> much impressed.|$|R
5|$|Whatever {{the cause}} of Themistocles's unpopularity in 479BC, it {{obviously}} did not last long. Both Diodorus and Plutarch suggest he was quickly restored to the favour of the Athenians. Indeed, after 479 BC, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to have enjoyed a relatively long period of popularity.|$|E
5|$|When Histiaeus {{heard of}} the fall of Miletus, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to have {{appointed}} himself as leader of the resistance against Persia. Setting out from Byzantium with his force of Lesbians, he sailed to Chios. The Chians refused to receive him, so he attacked and destroyed the remnants of the Chian fleet. Crippled by the two defeats at sea, the Chians then acquiesced to Histiaeus's leadership.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving in}} office for an extra year to 1905, Clarke retired, having helped to create a better system {{for the benefit of}} all. While the Colonial Office sought to mediate {{conflicts}} of interest, its impact was varied due to its desire to avoid expense. Milner was preoccupied with his vision of a new South Africa incorporating Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed the support of the BSAC. He appears to have had respect for Clarke, although <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to have resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally I hardly think the office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E
60|$|Gordon kept {{gazing at}} his friend; <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> {{positively}} fascinated.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Weatherley coughed. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> {{unwilling to}} leave Arnold behind.|$|R
60|$|The man {{shook his}} head. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> almost {{incapable}} of speech.|$|R
5|$|Although Theobald was a monk, his episcopal {{household}} was not monastic in character. As {{he settled}} {{into the role of}} archbishop, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to have left most of his monastic habits behind, although he continued to have a monk as a companion. His nephews and brother benefited from his nepotism, with his nephews becoming part of his household early in his archepiscopate. The four nephews—Guillaume, Gilbert, Roger and Lechard—were witnesses to a charter of Theobald's dated to about 1150 or 1153. After Theobald's death, Guillaume was a clerk in Bartholomew, the Bishop of Exeter's household in around 1172.|$|E
5|$|At 21:30 Forte and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, Forte brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing and bearing down on the French ship, under a light wind from the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to have thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|Back at her apartment, Scully runs a {{background}} check of Doggett on her computer, learning about his background as a former NYPD detective. She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks outside {{the window to see}} if anyone is out there. She angrily calls Doggett to protest him monitoring her phone conversations, which <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> genuinely surprised about. She notices a mysterious man and runs into the hall to pursue him, but meets her landlord Mr. Coeben who tells her that he had seen Mulder.|$|E
60|$|Saton leaned {{towards her}} till <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> even about to spring.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned and}} looked at him searchingly. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> outside her.|$|R
60|$|To my {{surprise}} his face clouded. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> troubled, even pained.|$|R
5|$|Bart and Milhouse visit a joke shop. Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa plan {{a trip to}} the Springsonian Museum so {{they can}} see the Egyptian Treasures of Isis exhibit and the Orb of Isis. Marge has to take Bart to a doctor instead, since he has superglued various novelty items to his face. Since this is Lisa's last chance to see the exhibit, she phones Homer to ask him if she can take the bus. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> uncertain, which prompts her to trick him into letting her take the bus.|$|E
5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|During Warwick's exile, King Edward {{stripped}} Montagu of the Earldom of Northumberland, {{making him}} Marquis of Montagu instead. John Neville {{appears to have}} seen this as a reduction in rank, and accepted it with poor grace. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> particularly to have complained {{about the lack of}} landed estate that his new marquisate brought with it, calling it a 'pie's nest'. When the Earl of Warwick and Clarence returned, they distracted Edward with a rebellion in the north, which the king ordered Montagu to raise troops to repress in the king's name. Montagu, however, having raised a small army, turned against Edward, almost capturing him at Olney, Buckinghamshire; the king, with his other brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled into exile in Burgundy.|$|E
60|$|With {{that the}} {{curtains}} closed, and <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to snore immediately.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Brott hesitated. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> {{a little}} {{uncertain}} how to continue.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fentolin sighed. He {{shook his}} head slowly. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> pained.|$|R
