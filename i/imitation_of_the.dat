5|$|After 1261, {{new church}} {{architecture}} in Constantinople consisted mainly of additions to existing monastic churches, {{such as the}} Monastery of Lips and Pammakaristos Church, {{and as a result}} the building complexes are distinguished in part by an asymmetric array of domes on their roofs. This effect may have been in <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier triple-church Pantokrator monastic complex.|$|E
25|$|With {{his tone}} poems Amazonas (1917, first {{performed}} in Paris in 1929) and Uirapurú (1917, first performed 1935) he created works dominated by indigenous Brazilian influences. The works use Brazilian folk tales and characters, <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jungle and its fauna, <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nose-flute by the violinophone, and not least <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uirapuru itself.|$|R

5|$|Burke also {{criticizes the}} {{learning}} {{associated with the}} French philosophes; he maintains that new ideas should not, in an <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emerging discipline of science, be tested on society {{in an effort to}} improve it, but that populations should rely on custom and tradition to guide them.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} the first large building in which Raymond managed to use his principles of simplicity, economy of materials, elegance and lightness learned from his residential works. Raymond cited {{the design of the}} Hiroshima Peace Museum by Kenzo Tange as being an external <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reader's Digest Building.|$|E
5|$|Pierre Henri Cami's {{character}} Baron de Crac, a French {{soldier and}} courtier under Louis XV, is an <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baron Munchausen stories. In 1998, the British game designer James Wallis used the Baron character {{to create a}} multi-player storytelling game, The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen, in which players improvise Munchausen-like first-person stories while overcoming objections and other interruptions from opponents.|$|E
50|$|As {{in other}} leafbirds, <b>the</b> call <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blue-winged leafbird {{consists}} of a rich mixture <b>of</b> <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calls <b>of</b> various other species of birds.|$|R

5|$|The {{inspiration}} for the title sequence, set inside the secret laboratory of Dr Hassler, was the espionage theme embodied by the character: in what Archer and Hearn describe as an <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> style of 1960s James Bond films, a miniature camera is seen to be concealed inside Hassler's artificial eye.|$|E
5|$|According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on {{its base}} in <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky. It was {{reported}} in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary sources is a ceiling over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain from the ceiling, {{although it is not}} known whether this was a feature of the same dome. The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit. Henry Fuseli long claimed that his planned Shakespeare ceiling (in <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sistine Chapel ceiling) had given Boydell {{the idea for the}} gallery. James Northcote claimed that his Death of Wat Tyler and Murder of the Princes in the Tower had {{motivated}} Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E

5|$|From 1995-1997, {{the firm}} created seven new subsidiaries. These {{included}} Guthy-Renker Radio, Internet, Select Network, International and Fitness, {{as well as}} subsidiaries like an online dating service and a psychic business that did not perform well. Guthy-Renker partnered with National Media Corp. to help market some of its fitness products, {{which led to a}} legal dispute that was settled with undisclosed terms in 1997. Guthy-Renker claimed National Media Corp. excessively aired infomercials for an exercise machine, the Fitness Flyer, and started selling an unauthorized <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original. National claimed Guthy-Renker had not provided enough Fitness Flyers to meet demand.|$|E
5|$|Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel {{observes that}} from a heraldic point of view, on the French {{as well as the}} revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe {{represents}} a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not an <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags since an earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Hanna–Barbera Productions {{was the most}} {{successful}} television animation studio in the business. The Hanna–Barbera studio produced over 3000animated half-hour television shows. Among the more than 100cartoon series and specials they produced were: Atom Ant, Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy (an <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier Spike and Tyke MGM cartoons), Jonny Quest, Josie and the Pussycats, Magilla Gorilla, Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks, Quick Draw McGraw, and Top Cat. Top Cat was based on Phil Silvers's character Sgt. Bilko, though it has been erroneously reported that Sgt. Bilko {{was the basis for}} Yogi Bear. The Hanna–Barbera studio also produced Scooby-Doo (1969–1986) and The Smurfs (1981–1989). The company also produced animated specials based on Alice in Wonderland, Jack and the Beanstalk, Cyrano de Bergerac as well as the feature-length film Charlotte's Web (1973).|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1947, {{publishers}} began issuing new {{titles in}} the crime comics genre, sometimes changing <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> existing series but often creating new books whole cloth. Many of these titles were direct <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> format and content of Crime Does Not Pay.|$|R

5|$|The {{kings and}} queens regnant of England and the kings of France were the only Christian rulers who claimed the divine gift (divinitus) to cure by {{touching}} or stroking the diseased. This special aptitude {{was thought to be}} evidence of God's high esteem of the two monarchies, though they never agreed upon whose predecessors the ability was first conferred. In England, Saint Edward the Confessor (r. 1042–1066) was said to be the first monarch to possess the healing power of the royal touch. The French, who normally traced the origins of their monarchs' divine gift back to Philip I (r. 1059–1108) or even Robert II (r. 987–1031), denied that Saint Edward used the royal touch. They insisted that the first English monarch to claim the ability was Henry I (r. 1100–1135), and that his touching was a politically influenced <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gift granted exclusively to French monarchs.|$|E
5|$|The {{warships}} of the Batavian squadron {{were all}} commissioned into the Royal Navy {{and attached to}} the squadron at the Cape, an action for which Elphinstone was criticised by the Admiralty. Elphinstone returned to Britain in October 1796. His flagship Monarch passed right through the French fleet of the Expédition d'Irlande during a snow storm, anchoring in a disabled state at Crookhaven on 25 December. Following his return he was made Baron Keith for his capture and retention of the Cape Colony. Most of the sailors and soldiers in the Dutch force were Germans and nearly all entered British service, either with the Royal Navy or the East India Company. Lucas and the Dutch officers later returned to Europe in the cartel Gertruida. One of the captured ships, HMS Dortrecht became notorious the following year when the crew mutinied at Saint Helena in <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spithead and Nore mutinies in Britain. Only the intervention of Captain Charles Brisbane, who threw a noose around the ringleader's neck and threatened death if the disobedience was repeated, succeeded in intimidating the rebellious seamen. In the Batavian Republic Lucas's surrender caused popular outrage. On the admiral's return he faced a court martial by the National Assembly of the Batavian Republic on 11 April 1797 and an investigation by Jacobus Spoors. Lucas did not survive to see {{the conclusion of the}} trial, dying of natural causes on 21 June 1797, but he was ultimately exonerated in December 1797.|$|E
5|$|The {{timing of}} the {{coronation}} has varied throughout British history. King Edgar's coronation was some 15 years after his accession in 957 {{and may have been}} intended to mark the high point of his reign, or that he reached the age of 30, the age at which Jesus Christ was baptised. HaroldII was crowned on the day {{after the death of his}} predecessor, Edward the Confessor, the rush probably reflecting the contentious nature of Harold's succession; whereas the first Norman monarch, WilliamI, was also crowned on the day he became king, 25December 1066, but three weeks since the surrender of English nobles and bishops at Berkhampstead, allowing time to prepare a spectacular ceremony. Most of his successors were crowned within weeks, or even days, of their accession. EdwardI was fighting in the Ninth Crusade when he acceded to the throne in 1272; he was crowned soon after his return in 1274. EdwardII's coronation, similarly, was delayed by a campaign in Scotland in 1307. HenryVI was only a few months old when he acceded in 1422; he was crowned in 1429, but did not officially assume the reins of government until he was deemed of sufficient age, in 1437. Pre-modern coronations were usually either on a Sunday, the Christian Sabbath, or on a Christian holiday. Edgar's coronation was at Pentecost, WilliamI's on Christmas Day, possibly in <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine emperors, and John's was on Ascension Day. Elizabeth I consulted her astrologer, John Dee, before deciding on an auspicious date. The coronations of Charles II in 1661 and Anne in 1702 were on St George's Day, the feast of the patron saint of England.|$|E

25|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that some specific whistles, called signature whistles, are used by dolphins to identify and/or call each other; dolphins have been observed emitting both other specimens' signature whistles, and their own.
