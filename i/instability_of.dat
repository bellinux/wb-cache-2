5|$|A {{cold front}} stalled {{a couple hundred}} miles {{southeast}} of Bermuda on October 10. During that day, a strong upper-level trough moved southeastward off the southeast coast of the United States. Due to several factors, including upward motion and strong diffluence—the rate at which a fluid moves—the area became baroclinically unstable. This caused {{the interaction between the}} trough and the front to develop into an extratropical low about 345miles (555km) southeast of Bermuda on October 11. The low moved quickly northward, then northwestward, strengthening quickly due to the <b>instability</b> <b>of</b> the atmosphere. Late on October 11, the system slowed, and the upper-level circulation became aligned with the low-level circulation. The extratropical storm began to develop tropical characteristics late on October 11, including surface temperatures warmer than the surrounding environment, and vertical wind characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Based on its organization, the system developed into Subtropical Storm One early on October 12 while located about 35miles (55km) south of Bermuda.|$|E

Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275 BC after the stalemate and ultimate failure of both campaigns, which contributed to the rise of Rome now that Greek cities in southern Italy such as Tarentum became Roman allies. Despite having a depleted treasury, Pyrrhus decided to invade Macedonia in 274 BC, due to the perceived political <b>instability</b> <b>of</b> Antigonus II's regime.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} systematic {{experiments and}} visualization on the <b>instabilities</b> <b>of</b> phase-change heat transfer for water, ethanol and acetone {{in a flat}} evaporator of a two phase closed system, respectively. The effects of the heat flux, filling ratio, coolant temperature and working fluid type on the instabilities and their mechanisms have been systematically investigated. The experimental {{results show that the}} <b>instabilities</b> <b>of</b> phase-change heat transfer are strongly related to the corresponding heat transfer modes. The <b>instabilities</b> <b>of</b> temperature and heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of the evaporator are mainly caused by the bubble behaviours, the physical properties and the operation pressures. Natural convection, intermittent boiling and fully developed nucleate boiling are the main heat transfer modes in the present study. The condensate droplets may affect the instabilities due to inducing periodic boiling at lower heat fluxes. The maximum standard deviations of the evaporator temperature and vapor pressure fluctuations can reach 3. 1 °C and 0. 8 kPa respectively during the intermittent boiling. There is no intermittent boiling regime for ethanol and acetone in the present study. Therefore, no <b>instability</b> phenomena <b>of</b> nucleate boiling with ethanol and acetone are observed in the present study...|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the great}} rarity of odd–odd nuclei, almost all the {{primordial}} isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived radioisotope potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single beta-stable nuclide, since {{there is not a}} difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number (isobars) free to beta decay toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the <b>instability</b> <b>of</b> an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. Beryllium is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Struthiosaurinae {{has been}} {{considered}} a junior synonym of the family Nodosauridae by Walter P.

Kirkland and his colleagues followed Ford in using Struthiosaurinae as a clade of basal nodosaurids, but concluded that the only other subfamily of Nodosauridae was Nodosaurinae. According to Kirkland et al., Acanthopholinae was not an acceptable classification for the new clade of previously unrecognized nodosaurids because of the <b>instability</b> <b>of</b> Acanthopholis. Struthiosaurinae was decided on as {{the name of the}} clade, as it was the next published term after Acanthopholinae. To ensure the group was rendered valid, Kirkland et al. redefined Struthiosaurinae as the most inclusive clade containing Europelta but not Cedarpelta, Peloroplites, Sauropelta, or Edmontonia. This definition includes the genera Anoplosaurus, Europelta, Hungarosaurus and Struthiosaurus inside the newly defined group.
