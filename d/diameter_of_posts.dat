50|$|The patent Stülcken derrick is {{used for}} very heavy cargo. It stems from the German {{shipyard}} HC Stülcken & Sohn which has been taken over later by neighboring yard Blohm & Voss. This derrick can handle up to 300 tonnes. The Stülcken can be made ready in few minutes, dramatically faster than a traditional heavy derrick, doesn't require lots of space and is operated by four winches. Between two v-shaped, unstayed Samson-posts is the Stülcken secured. This {{makes it possible to}} let the derrick swing through the posts to reach another hatch. For each post is a hoisting winch, a span winch and a lever that is run by one man only. Bearings, swivels, sheaves and the gooseneck can be unattended for up to four years and create only a friction of about 2%. The span tackles are independent and the halyard is endless. With the revolving suspension heads on the posts it takes ten minutes to swing all the way through. In the double-pendulum block type, half of the cargo tackle can be anchored {{to the base of the}} boom. In order to double the hook speed, the halyard passes through the purchases since one end is secured which reduces the SWL to its half. Typical dimensions of a 275 tonne Stülcken are: 25.5 m length, 0.97 m diameter, 1.5 m to 3.4 m <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts,</b> 18 m apart the posts (upper end) and 8.4 m apart the posts (lower end). The hook of a full-loaded 275 tonne Stülcken can move 2.3 m per minute. If only one purchase is secured and the derrick is loaded with 137 tonnes the hook gains velocity to 4.6 m per min. Even more speed can be gained when the winch ratios are reduced to 100 tonnes (triple speed) and 68 tonnes (quadruple speed). Detaching the union table the double-pendulum block type of Stülcken is able to swing through which allows the lower blocks to swing freely to each side of the boom. In this way the derrick reaches a vertical position. A bullrope easily pulls the derrick to the other side until the weight of the cargo tips the derrick over. The span tackles now have the weight on the other side. The union table is fixed again and the derrick can start its work on the other side. There are also Stülcken with single-pendulum blocks. At this type the cargo hook is detached and the lower and upper cargo block are hauled into the center of the Stülcken. To tip the derrick over the gravity is here used again. A derrick helps pump oil in most offshore rigs.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} flexural {{properties of}} different fiber posts systems and to morphologically characterize their micro-structure. METHODS: Six types of translucent fiber posts were selected: RelyX Post (3 M ESPE), ParaPost Taper Lux (Colthéne-Whaledent), GC Fiber Post (GC), LuxaPost (DMG), FRC Postec Plus (Ivoclar-Vivadent), D. T. Light-Post (RTD). For each post system and size, ten specimens {{were subjected to}} a three-points bending test. Maximum fracture load, flexural strength and flexural modulus were determined using a universal loading device (5848 MicroTester(®), Instron). Besides, for each system, three intact posts of similar dimensions were processed for scanning electron microscopy to morphologically characterize the micro-structure. The following structural characteristics were analyzed: fibers/matrix ratio, density of fibers, diameter of fibers and distribution of fibers. Data were statistically analyzed with ANOVA. RESULTS: Type and <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> were found to significantly affect the fracture load, flexural strength and flexural modulus (p< 0. 05). Regarding maximum fracture load, it was found to increase with post diameter, in each post system (p< 0. 001). Regarding flexural strength and flexural modulus, the highest values were recorded for posts with the smallest diameter (p< 0. 001). Finally, structural characteristics significantly varied among the post systems tested. However, any correlation has been found between flexural strength and structural characteristics. SIGNIFICANCE: Flexural strength appeared not to be correlated to structural characteristics of fiber posts, but it may rather be affected by mechanical properties of the resin matrix and the interfacial adhesion between fibers and resin matrix. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Post {{and core}} has been {{considered}} for endodontically treated tooth, especially in cases with severe damage crowns. Recently fiber reinforced composite posts (FRC post) {{have been used in}} the treatment of endodontically treated teeth. Because the length and <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> are effective in stress distribution, {{the purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the effect of length and diameter of FRC post on fracture resistance. Methods: In this experimental study, 36 glass fiber posts with combination of 7 mm, 9 mm, and 12 mm length and 1. 1 mm, 1. 3 mm and 1. 5 mm diameter were divided into 9 groups of 4. These posts were cemented in root canals by Panavia. Samples were tested with 45 ° compressive forces for the evaluation of fracture resistance. Datas were analyzed using SPSS soft ware and One- way and Two-way ANOVA analyses. Results: Fracture resistance did not increase significantly with the effect of length and diameter simultaneously (P= 0. 85). Samples with 12 mm length and 1. 5 mm diameter had the greatest fracture resistance (1023 / 33 N± 239 / 22). The minimum fracture resistance had occurred in post with 7 mm length and 1. 5 mm diameter (503 / 13 N ± 69 / 18). Fracture resistance increased significantly by increasing the length and the same diameter. Conclusion: It can be concluded that fracture resistance is affected by the length and not the diameter of FRC post...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Endodontically treated {{teeth with}} {{extensive}} coronary destruction require posts and cores to enable prosthetic restoration. Despite the increasing use <b>of</b> prefabricated <b>posts,</b> cast metal posts and cores are still widely used. The {{quality of the}} latter {{is important for the}} longevity of restorative treatment, and failure can occur if the fundamental principles are not followed. Objective To radiographically evaluate the prosthetic principles of 1000 cast metal post-and-core restorations performed in single-rooted teeth and their coherence with the principles used for their confection. Material and method Digital periapical radiographs of 1000 endodontically treated, single-rooted teeth with cast metal posts and cores were selected from the collection of a radiology clinic (Centro de Imagem, Aracaju/SE, Brazil). The images were analyzed using a measurement software (ImageJ, USA) in accordance with the fundamental prosthetic principles: length and <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>post,</b> ratio between post and bone crest, contiguity <b>of</b> <b>post</b> to the root canal, gap between post and the remaining root canal filling, amount of remaining root canal filling, and absence of periapical lesion.

40|$|Abstract—Silicon-micromachining {{techniques}} have been com-bined with conventional material-synthesis methods to develop microelectrodes for 3 -D microbatteries. The resulting electrodes feature an organized array <b>of</b> high-aspect-ratio microscale <b>posts</b> fabricated {{on the current}} collector to increase their surface area and volume for a given footprint area of the device. The <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>posts</b> ranges from a few micrometers to a few hundred micrometers, with aspect ratios as high as 50. The fabrication approach is based on micromolding of the electrode materials and subsequent etching of the mold to release the electrode structures. Deep reactive-ion-etching or photo-assisted anodic etching {{has been used to}} form an array of deep holes in the silicon mold. Electroplating or colloidal-processing method has been used to fill the mold with battery-electrode materials. Measurements on electrochemical half-cells indicated that the 3 -D electrode arrays, which are composed of vanadium oxide nanorolls or carbon, exhibited much greater energy densities (per-footprint area) than that of the traditional 2 -D electrode geometries.

Posts with constant taper angle but with three different lengths (9, 12, 15 mm) and apical diameters (0. 5, 0. 9, 1. 1 mm) were cemented using zinc phosphate cement into the prepared and roughened <b>post</b> spaces <b>of</b> 90 intact anterior teeth. The post retention concerning length and diameter, being independent from each other, was measured by a tensile force test. The retentive strength was found to be proportional to the length {{as well as to the}} <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>posts.</b> The mean minimum strength (181 +/- 14 N) recorded for the thinnest and shortest post was significantly lower than that of mean maximum strength (612 +/- 85 N) obtained from those of the thickest and longest post.

Thus measurements of flow-induced forces, surface pressures and velocity fields are very important in the engineering discipline.

Two groups (n = 30) were randomly formed according to the device used to apply the adhesive system: microbrush or standard bristle brush (control). Each group was divided into 3 subgroups (n = 10) according to the technique used to place the luting agent into the root canal: using only a lentulo spiral before setting the post, applying it onto the post surface, or combining both methods. After 72 hours, the tensile force required to dislodge each post was determined by a universal testing machine (Instron 4444) set at a speed of 1 mm/min. The results indicated that the use of the microbrush yielded higher bond strength values (0. 1740 ± 0. 04 kN) than those recorded for the bristle brush tip (0. 1369 ± 0. 04 kN, p < 0. 001). Bonferroni's test demonstrated a higher retention (p < 0. 001) in radicular post cemented with the technique that combined both methods (lentulo + post: 0. 1787 ± 0. 03 kN) than that obtained with lentulo (0. 1461 ± 0. 065 kN) or post (0. 1416 ± 0. 03 kN) alone. The interactions between the adhesive system and luting agent application techniques presented statistical difference (p < 0. 001). It was concluded that the best performance in terms of tensile strength among the tested conditions was obtained when the adhesive system was applied with a microbrush and the luting agent was taken into the root canal with lentulo spirals alone (0. 1961 ± 0. 04 kN) and combining both methods (lentulo + post: 0. 1911 ± 0. 02 kN) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> a random graph G(n, p) for various ranges of p {{close to the}} phase transition point for connectivity. For a disconnected graph G, we use the convention that the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> G is the maximum <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> its connected components. We show that almost surely the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> random graph G(n, p) equals(1 +o(1)) log(np) if np ##. Moreoverif log n = c> 8, then the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> G(n, p) is concentrated on two values. In general, if log n = c>c 0, the diameter is concentrated on at most 2 # + 4 values. We also proved that the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> G(n, p) is almost surely equal to the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> its giant component if np > 3. 6. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The effect <b>of</b> <b>post</b> weld heat {{treatment}} on mechanical properties of friction welded Alloy 718 and SNCRW was investigated. Friction welding tests {{were carried out}} at a constant rotation speed and pressure. Optimum friction condition {{was found to be}} the friction pressure of 25 kg/cm 2, friction time of 40 sec, upset pressure of 80 kg/cm 2, and dwell time of 5 sec. After friction welding tests, post weld {{heat treatment}}s were performed in the temperature range of 500 - 900 °C for 8 hrs in order to investigate the microstructure and mechanical properties of weld joint. Specimens with the post weld heat treatment at 720 °C for 8 hrs show optimal mechanical properties. Residual stress <b>of</b> <b>post</b> weld heat treated specimens was measured to weld joint in the same temperature range. After friction welding tests on samples with a <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> 80 mm, tensile properties of post-weld-heat-treated and non-heat-treated samples were compared...|$|R
