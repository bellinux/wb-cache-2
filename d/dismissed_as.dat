5|$|Zenobia: {{the wife}} of Odaenathus was accused by the Augustan History of having {{formerly}} conspired with Maeonius, as Hairan I was her stepson {{and she could not}} accept that he was the heir to her husband instead of her own children. However, there is no suggestion in the Augustan History that Zenobia was involved in the event that saw her husband's murder; the act is attributed to Maeonius' degeneracy and jealousy. Those accounts by the Augustan History can be <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> fiction. The hints in modern scholarship that Zenobia had a hand in the assassination out of her desire to rule the empire and dismay with her husband's pro-Roman policy can be <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> there was no reversal of that policy during the first years following Odaenathus' death.|$|E

5|$|After their release, {{the journalists}} {{went to the}} US embassy in Saigon to {{complain}} about their treatment {{at the hands of}} Diệm's officials and asked for US government protection. Their appeals were <b>dismissed,</b> <b>as</b> was a direct appeal to the White House. Through the efforts of US Ambassador Frederick Nolting, the assault charges laid against the journalists were subsequently dropped.

5|$|As Mary was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. From the outset, there were two claims to the Regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next in line to the throne. Beaton's claim {{was based on a}} version of the late king's will that his opponents <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> a forgery. Arran, with the support of his friends and relations, became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schubert's last sonatas {{have long}} been historically neglected, <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> inferior in style to Beethoven's piano sonatas. However, the negative view has changed during the late twentieth century, and today these works are usually praised for their conveying of an idiosyncratic, personal Schubertian style, indeed quite different from Beethoven's, but holding its own virtues. In this mature style, the Classical perception of harmony and tonality, and the treatment of musical structure, are radically altered, generating a new, distinct type of sonata form.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, three {{collectors}} {{discovered a}} T206 Wagner that featured Wagner {{in a different}} pose, never seen {{in any of the}} other cards.

The card broke apart, and as a result, the card was <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> a fake.|$|E
