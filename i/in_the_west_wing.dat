Chiluca, a white stone, covers the walls and floors and the tezontle frames the doors and windows. At the crossing of the structure is an octagonal dome framed by arches that form curved triangles where they meet {{at the top of}} the dome. The principal altar is in the ornate Churrigueresque style and crafted by indigenous artist Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque. It was inaugurated in 1829.|$|E

5|$|Sorkin {{conceived}} the political drama The West Wing in 1997 {{when he went}} unprepared to a lunch with producer John Wells and in a panic pitched to Wells a series centered on the senior staff of the White House, using leftover ideas from his script for The American President. He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for The American President, and they found themselves discussing public service and {{the passion of the}} people who serve. Wells took the concept and pitched it to the NBC network, but was told to wait because the facts behind the Lewinsky scandal were breaking and there was concern that an audience {{would not be able to}} take a series about the White House seriously. When a year later some other networks started showing interest <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>West</b> <b>Wing,</b> NBC decided to greenlight the series despite their previous reluctance. The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by Warner Bros. Television.|$|E
5|$|When Bill Clinton {{took office}} as President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady and her press {{secretary}} reiterated {{that she would}} be using that form of her name.

She was also the first to have an office <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Wing</b> of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing. She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones. After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.|$|E

She should probably be credited for the backlit marble and alabaster sun that decorates {{the floor of the}} grand salon. On the other hand, she evidently did not make any changes to the park; it is unclear whether she continued to use the Ermitage as a library.|$|R
