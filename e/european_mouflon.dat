40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the presence of β-lactamase producing or fluoroquinolone-resistant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in <b>European</b> <b>mouflons</b> (Ovis orientalis musimon). The mouflon samples originated from nasal and perineal swabs and/or organ samples in cases of a suspected infection. Only one of the 32 mouflons was tested positive for the presence of Enterobacteriaceae that displayed either an ESBL/AmpC phenotype or were resistant to ciprofloxacin. The positively tested swab originated from a sample of the jejunal mucosa of a four-year old female mouflon. Two different colony morphotypes were identified as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. These isolates were phenotypically and genotypically characterized in detail by a polyphasic approach. Both isolates were multi-drug resistant. The E. coli isolate belonged to the phylogenetic group B 1 and sequence type (ST) 744 and harboured the β-lactamase genes blaCTX-M- 15 and blaOXA- 1. The K. pneumoniae, identified as ST 11, harboured the β-lactamase genes blaSHV- 11, blaOXA- 1, and blaDHA- 1 as well as the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) gene qnrB 55.

40|$|The mouflon {{population}} of Cyprus (Ovis orientalis ophion) comprises historically preserved feral descendants of sheep domesticated during the Neolithic. We determined genetic identity of this taxon {{in order to}} elucidate its systematic placement and enforce its protection. We used 12 loci of microsatellite DNA to infer genetic relationships between the Cypriot mouflon and either long-time isolated (Corsica, Sardinia) or recently introduced (central Italy) <b>European</b> <b>mouflons</b> (O. o. musimon). We also sequenced the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Cytochrome-b gene to infer {{the origin of the}} Cypriot mouflon including many National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) entries of European and Near Eastern conspecifics. Microsatellites disclosed net divergence between Western Mediterranean and Cypriot mouflon. The latter was included in the highly heterogeneous Near Eastern O. orientalis mtDNA group, Iran representing the most credited region as the source for its ancient introduction to Cyprus. Both international and national legislation protect the mouflon of Cyprus as a wild taxon (O. o. ophion). However, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and NCBI include the Cypriot mouflon as subspecies of its respective domestic species, the sheep (O. aries). Unfortunately, people charged with crime against protected mouflon may benefit from such taxonomic inconsistency between legislation and databases, as the latter can frustrate molecular DNA forensic outcomes. Until a definitive light can be shed on Near Eastern O. orientalis systematics, we suggest that the Cypriot mouflon should be unvaryingly referred to as O. o. ophion in order not to impair conservation in the country where it resides...|$|R
40|$|Sheep {{are thought}} to {{have been one of the}} first {{livestock}} to be domesticated in the Near East, thus playing an important role in human history. The current whole mitochondrial genome phylogeny for the genus Ovis is based on: the five main domestic haplogroups occurring among sheep (O. aries), along with molecular data from two wild <b>European</b> <b>mouflons,</b> three urials, and one argali. With the aim to shed some further light on the phylogenetic relationship within this genus, the first complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a Cypriot mouflon (O. gmelini ophion) is here reported. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using a dataset of whole Ovis mitogenomes as well as D-loop sequences. The concatenated sequence of 28 mitochondrial genes of one Cypriot mouflon, and the D-loop sequence of three Cypriot mouflons were compared to sequences obtained from samples representatives of the five domestic sheep haplogroups along with samples of the extant wild and feral sheep. The sample included also individuals from the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Corsica hosting remnants of the first wave of domestication that likely went then back to feral life. The divergence time between branches in the phylogenetic tree has been calculated using seven different calibration points by means of Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood inferences. Results suggest that urial (O. vignei) and argali (O. ammon) diverged from domestic sheep about 0. 89 and 1. 11 million years ago (MYA), respectively; and dates the earliest radiation of domestic sheep common ancestor at around 0. 3 MYA. Additionally, our data suggest that the rise of the modern sheep haplogroups happened in the span of time between six and 32 thousand years ago (KYA). A close phylogenetic relationship between the Cypriot and the Anatolian mouflon carrying the X haplotype was detected. The genetic distance between this group and the other ovine haplogroups supports the hypothesis that it may be a new haplogroup never described before. Furthermore, the updated phylogenetic tree presented in this study determines a finer classification of ovine species and may help to classify more accurately new mitogenomes within the established haplogroups so far identified...|$|R

5000|$|The Karakachan sheep is {{accepted}} {{as the most}} typical and most primitive, coarse wool sheep type [...] "tzakel" [...] in Bulgaria.This was proved by the craniometrical research of Balevska, Petrov (1967). According to the same authors this sheep is closest to the <b>European</b> <b>mouflon</b> (Ovis musimon).The Karakachan sheep is small (about 57 cm at withers), the short and thin tail is typical sign of the breed. Its wool is coarse and long (up to 26 cm). The coloration is grey-black and brown-black, but very seldom white. Very vital and energetic animal, very tough, almost never being ill, very unpretentious towards the food source. Highly developed feeling for being in a flock. Low productivity of litters (100 - 102%). The Karakachan sheep {{had been one of}} the most widespread breeds in Bulgaria in the past. In the beginning of the 20th century the population size had been more than 500 000 individuals. In 1957, during the nationalization of the farming practice, the number is decreased to 158 896 individuals. At that time the socialist government decided to replace the local breeds of sheep with foreign, fine-fleeced. As a consequence of the state policy the local breeds had been massively crossbred with other breeds. There are other factors which threaten the breed. The alpine pastures in the country are hardly used. But if the Karakachan sheep is bred in lower mountainous lands it has lower productivity compared with other breeds. At the moment the mountain livestock breeding is a losing practice. The government does not stimulate private livestock breeders to keep and work with autochthon breeds.

40|$|To date, {{investigations}} of genetic diversity and {{the origins of}} domestication in sheep have utilised autosomal microsatellites and variation in the mitochondrial genome. We present the first analysis of both domestic and wild sheep using genetic markers residing on the ovine Y chromosome. Analysis of a single nucleotide polymorphism (oY 1) in the SRY promoter region revealed that allele A-oY 1 was present in all wild bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), two subspecies of thinhorn sheep (Ovis dalli), <b>European</b> <b>Mouflon</b> (Ovis musimon) and the Barbary (Ammontragis lervia). A-oY 1 also had the highest frequency (71. 4 %) within 458 domestic sheep drawn from 65 breeds sampled from Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia. Sequence analysis of a second locus, microsatellite SRYM 18, revealed a compound repeat array displaying fixed differences, which identified bighorn and thinhorn sheep as distinct from the <b>European</b> <b>Mouflon</b> and domestic animals.

Investigation of the geographical distribution of each haplotype revealed that one (H 6) was both very common and widespread in the global sample of domestic breeds.

40|$|After being transported into Europe {{during the}} Neolithic, mouflon (Ovis aries musimon) became extinct from {{mainland}} Europe, but remnant populations persisted and became feral on the Mediterranean islands of Corsica and Sardinia.

This thesis aimed to investigate the global and local ancestry of <b>European</b> <b>mouflon</b> and domestic sheep, to investigate signals of artificial and natural selection in their genomes, and to develop analytical frameworks and informatic tools to aid similar analyses using SNP array data.

By applying a novel approach to aid the investigation of local genomic ancestry data, signals of mouflon ancestry in sheep could be inferred and were found to be related to biological functions involved with innate immunity processes with bitter taste recognition being identified in two breeds known for their broad dietary choices. By investigating signals of positive selection and local adaptation in feral and domestic sheep using novel locus-specific empirical p-value inference, traits with selection signatures such as fertility, pigmentation and behaviour were identified in sheep, while traits involved with stature - probably related to mating success - were found in mouflon.
