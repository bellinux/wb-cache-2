5|$|As {{with all}} of his Brushstrokes works, it is in part a satirical {{response}} to the gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism. Like most of Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dots works it is a <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> mechanical reproduction via painterly technique. In this case, the satire comes from the <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> the graphical <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> the spontaneous painting motion in painstaking painterly detail.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} called a masterpiece <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> a battle scene, and much more than a simple <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> a bloody battle. It is a complex picture, requiring more than a cursory look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate it. At the same time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting. Others have criticized the painting for being too crowded and chaotic.|$|E
5|$|Þorgerðr and Irpa {{are again}} {{mentioned}} together in chapter 88 of Njáls saga, {{set in the}} 10th and 11th centuries. Here, Hrapp breaks into the temple owned by Haakon and Gudbrand while Haakon is at a feast at Gudbrand's home. Hrapp plunders a seated <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> Þorgerðr; he takes a large gold ring from her plus the linen hood she is wearing. Next, Hrapp spots a <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> Thor and Thor's wain. He takes a gold ring from the <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> Thor too, and, thirdly, he takes a ring from a <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> Irpa there. Hrapp takes all of the images from the temple, strips them of their items, and then burns the temple until leaving at dawn.|$|E

5|$|The {{theme of}} {{swimming}} through flames {{is connected to}} the <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> Guido Guinizelli, a poet who influenced Dante, seeking such a state in Purgatorio XXVI. However, the <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> swimming was transformed into an image of dancing, an act that appears throughout Yeats's poetry, within purgatorial flames. The critic Dominic Manganiello suggests that, in combining the image of dancing with purgation, Eliot merges Dante's and Yeats's poetic themes.|$|E

5|$|Yuri on Ice {{has raised}} {{discussion}} concerning its <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> a same-sex relationship between its protagonists, with some critics praising it for covering homosexuality {{in a way}} that differs from most anime and manga such as yaoi, and for dealing with homosexuality in a country and sport that has present-day issues with homophobia; others criticised its depiction for being unrealistic and ambiguous. The series has also been praised for its <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> anxiety, and also raised a brief controversy concerning a similar figure skating-based title to be released in the United States in 2017.|$|E
