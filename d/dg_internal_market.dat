40|$|Pre-demolition audit or waste audit is {{the tool}} {{to assess the}} {{materials}} {{to be removed from}} the building or infrastructure and their potential value by external experts prior to the demolition or renovation activity. Such audits are essential since they enable all stakeholders involved to get information of the composition of waste and make it easier to find markets for different waste types. The development of guidelines for waste auditing is one of the action points of the Circular Economy agenda of the European Commission. It is likely that the Commission will recommend member states to make the waste audit mandatory in order to increase the quality of recycling. A framework for waste audit was developed in a contract work financed by Commissions’ <b>DG</b> for <b>Internal</b> <b>Market,</b> Industry, Enterprises and SMEs (GROW) [1]. The guidelines are establishing the basic principles of waste auditing, identification, reporting and recommendations for the further treatment. This paper presents the basic needs and benefits of such harmonized approach to the waste auditing including good practices from the selected countries. It {{should be noted that the}} number of materials separated due to their dangerous nature is growing and the methods for the identification of contamination are better which can result in a slight decrease of recyclable materials, but in a better quality of the materials that are recycled...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of the Nanocomput project, the main aims of which were to review {{the current status of}} {{computational}} methods that are potentially useful for predicting the properties of engineered nanomaterials, and to assess their applicability in order to provide advice on the use of these approaches {{for the purposes of the}} REACH regulation. Since computational methods cover a broad range of models and tools, emphasis was placed on Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) and Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, and their potential role in predicting NM properties. In addition, the status of a diverse array of compartment-based mathematical models was assessed. These models comprised toxicokinetic (TK), toxicodynamic (TD), in vitro and in vivo dosimetry, and environmental fate models. Finally, based on systematic reviews of the scientific literature, as well as the outputs of the EU-funded research projects, recommendations for further research and development were also made. The Nanocomput project was carried out by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) for the Directorate-General (<b>DG)</b> for <b>Internal</b> <b>Market,</b> Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW) under the terms of an Administrative Arrangement between JRC and DG GROW.

40|$|This paper {{answers the}} {{following}} question: Do the uncertainty and salience of issues {{determine whether the}} European Commission will use an expert group to assist with policy formulation? Using rationalist theory, three hypotheses test whether transversality, the importance of standard-setting and the salience of a policy proposal determine whether a Commission DG will ask an expert group to assist in preparing that same proposal. Data was retrieved from official docu-ments via EUR-Lex. A binary logistic regression analysis has been conducted on a sample of 260 proposals that were drafted by DG Climate Action, DG Communications Networks, Content & Technology, DG Environment and <b>DG</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>Market</b> and Services. All proposals were adopted between 2010 and 2013. The empirical analysis shows that expert group involvement in policy formulation is neither negligible nor ubiquitous in terms of frequency as expert groups as-sisted in preparing 33. 5 % of the proposals. DGs {{were significantly more likely}} to consult an expert group when the pro-posal under preparation was more transversal in nature and/or when that proposal treated standard-setting more pro-nouncedly. In contrast, the salience of a proposal was shown to be insignificantly related to the presence of an expert group during policy formulation...|$|E

40|$|What is ‘the’ EU <b>internal</b> <b>market,</b> as economists see it? The present BEER paper {{attempts}} to survey and help readers understand various ‘economic’ {{approaches to the}} <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> idea. The paper starts with a conceptual discussion of what ‘the’ <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> is (in an economic perspective). Six different economic meanings of the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> are presented, with the sixth one being the economic benchmark in an ideal setting. Subsequently, the question is asked what the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> (i. e. its proper functioning) is good for. Put differently, the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> in the EU Treaty is a means, but a means to what? Beyond the typical economic growth objectives of the Rome Treaty (still valid today, with some qualifications), other Treaty objectives have emerged. Economists typically think in means-end relationships and the instrumental role of the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> for Treaty objectives is far from clear. The ‘new’ Commission <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> strategy of 2007 proposes a more goal-oriented <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> policy. Such a vision is more selective in picking intermediate objectives to which ‘the’ <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> should be instrumental, but it risks to ignore the major deficits in today’s internal market: services and labour! The means-end relationships get even more problematic once one begins to scrutinise all the socio-economic objectives of the current (Amsterdam/Nice) Treaty or still other intermediate objectives. The <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> (explicitly including the relevant common regulation) then becomes a ‘jack of all trades’ for the environment, {{a high level of}} social protection, innovation or ‘Social Europe’. These means/ends relationships often are ill-specified. The final section considers the future of the <b>internal</b> <b>market,</b> by distinguishing three strategies: incremental strategies (including the new <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> strategy of November 2007); the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> as the core of the Economic Union serving the ‘proper functioning of the monetary union’; and deepening and widening of the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> as justified by the functional subsidiarity test. Even though the latter two would seem to be preferable from an economic point of view, they currently lack political legitimacy and are therefore unlikely to be pursued in the near future...|$|R

40|$|After a {{decision-making}} process lasting 30 years, the EU Council finally adopted the general principles for a Regulation on the Statute for a European Company (Societas Europaea, hereafter SE) and the Directive {{with regard to}} the involvement of employees in European Companies (SE Directive) in December 2000. The main purpose was to enable companies to operate their businesses on a cross-border basis in Europe under the same corporate regime. The SE legislation entered into force on 8 October 2004 and, by mid- 2007, all EU countries had transposed it into national law. The SE Regulation required the European Commission to present a report on its application, including proposals for amendments where appropriate, five years after its entry into force. <b>DG</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>Market</b> and Services commissioned Ernst & Young to carry out this study.

40|$|This {{research}} project was initiated {{in response to}} concerns held by the author on aspects of the European Community (EC) <b>internal</b> <b>market.</b> These concerns applied particularly to what was understood {{at the time to}} be the perceptions of EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> practitioners; their perceptions on the process of EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> technical legislative change and on how well the EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> was functioning. A literature review was undertaken to determine if, and if so where, the EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> technical legislative change process was defined and to determine which organisations were the important players in the process. The literature review was then extended to determine more about the players in the process and the information exchanges between the defined process and individuals, such as EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> practitioners, having a legitimate interest in the process. Also within the literature review the views of other commentators are noted and assessed. A methodological review was undertaken. This review gave rise to the formulation of a structured interview that was applied to a purposive sample of EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> practitioners. Two main areas were examined via the structured interview. The first was the knowledge of the overall EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> technical legislative change process and of its main players.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Business Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> at selected insurance enterprises. This study examines an approach to <b>internal</b> <b>marketing.</b> In the introduction, relevant concepts are explained and background information regarding marketing, the marketing concept, the marketing environment and relationship marketing is discussed. In addition, an overview of the systems approach, the <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> synthesis and the <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> purpose is given, the advantages of <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> are shown, and <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> research, <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> segmentation and <b>internal</b> target <b>market</b> choice are discussed. After the summary of the <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> mix, the <b>internal</b> product elements are discussed. These elements include management tools, such as the vision, mission, goals and strategy of an enterprise. The internal environment, which consists of the enterprise's values, principles and internal culture, also forms part of the internal product. The management's leadership style, training and development, employee support services and staff compensation are explored as part of the internal product. Bearing the internal product in mind, the internal price is studied. This part of the <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> mix is discussed in terms of staff sacrifices and contributions weighing up staff sacrifices against staff rewards. Other internal price elements, such as staff commitment, risk, stress and work pressure, are analysed in addition to time and family sacrifices and staff responsibility. After comparing the internal product and the internal price, the internal distribution elements are analysed as components of the <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> mix. These include the type of internal distribution channel, the choice of distribution channel and the role players during internal distribution. Thereafter, physical distribution is discussed as an internal distribution element. Subsequently, <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> communications, the fourth element of the <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> mix, is discussed. This part of the study looks at internal advertising, internal personal selling, internal sales promotions and internal publicity. It furthermore evaluates the various requirements for effective <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> communication and <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> messages. The <b>internal</b> support processes necessary for effective <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> such as staff participation, change management, internal conflict management and innovation and creativity processes are identified and discussed. Lastly, this section of the study considers internal customer service as a prerequisite for <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> and also analyses aspects of this service such as internal service culture, total quality management and internal relationship management. It also delineates the requirements and principles for internal customer service and the advantages and disadvantages of an internal customer service strategy. The theoretical section of the study is followed by an exposition of the relevant findings of the empirical study. The most salient of these include: All the respondents from selected insurance enterprises found the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> research, <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> segmentation and <b>internal</b> target <b>market</b> choice to be unsatisfactory; The internal product of the big enterprise (number 6) is more successful than those of the other enterprises; Internal price is not as big a problem for these enterprises as the other elements of <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> are; The small enterprises are more successful with internal distribution than the other enterprises are; <b>Internal</b> <b>market</b> communication is a problem for all the selected enterprises, but the respondents from enterprises 1 and 6 are more satisfied with it than the respondents from the other enterprises; The internal processes and internal customer service are more successful at the small enterprises than they are at the big enterprises.

40|$|Large {{parts of}} {{both public and}} private {{disaster}} losses in Europe are not insured, which outs significant financial pressure to the victims themselves and the national and regional governments as well. The economic vulnerability generated by natural disasters can be already catastrophic for some (especially Eastern European) Member States and recent estimations suggest that without robust disaster risk management, even wealthier MS can face financial challenges in the future. This case study investigates multi-sector partnerships at different levels aiming to manage the financial risks associated with natural disasters. Our primary objective is to explore possibilities for a potential EU-wide partnership that would enhance the financial resilience of EU Member States against earthquakes and floods that are among the most costly disasters in Europe. One of the partnerships examined in this case study is a potential (currently non-existing) EU-wide partnership that can be established by reorienting the European Union's main post-disaster instrument, the European Solidarity Fund (EUSF). EU policy-making bodies including DG Regional and Urban Policy and <b>DG</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>Market</b> and Services are one of the key partners in the partnership since they have the relevant expert knowledge concerning the EUSF and the insurance market. Primary insurance companies, reinsurers (with a special attention to Europe Re) are also important partners due to their key role in disaster risk financing arrangements. National governments are also important because they have both implicit and explicit liabilities in the context of natural disasters, and in addition they {{play an important role in}} risk reduction. The second partnership in this case study deals with the financial risks associated with earthquake and flood events in Romania. Important elements of this partnership are the insurance companies that provide mandatory and facultative insurance policies to homeowners covering flood and earthquake risks, the national government and the local authorities which have key roles in disaster management including the responsibility of making available the necessary resources after disasters. ENHANCE will provide support to the above described two partnerships by delivering risk assessments and developing different options to enhance the financial resilience of EU Member States against flood and earthquake risks. Copula approaches are applied to derive at country loss distributions which are used to estimate the risk of selected MSP to current and future threats. The results will also be used for Romania on flood risk and an extreme value approach applied for earthquake risk. These results will provide the basis for exploring possibilities to increase the use of risk financing instruments with risk reduction measures. This analysis will include both quantitative risk management approaches as well as embed it within the current policy contexts within Europe and Romania and investigates the policy challenges under current legislative changes for risk financing and risk reduction policies...|$|E

A new instrument, measuring the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> orientation, is developed and subjected to standard scale development procedures. Six dimensions of the construct are confirmed; collegial interaction, group interaction, jorlllal interaction, external envirollment, wage flexibility and job flexibility.

This study proposes a conceptual framework which seeks to define the domain of the <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> concept, together with its’ antecedents and consequences. The subject of <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> is investigated within the context of tourism as a unique service industry in which there is a high level; of contact between customers and employees and where internal programmes aimed at employees have value to complement external programmes targeted at customers. A qualitative case study of one of the leading travel firms in UK from an employment perspective is used to shed light on the unique culture that underlies <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> practices, how <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> is practiced in reality, the way in which it affects both internal and external aspects of the organisation The findings highlight the importance of organisational culture and the manner in which culture underpins effective <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> within a business context. <b>Internal</b> <b>marketing</b> practices are shown to be vital in building and sustaining a people- and service-orientated culture throughout the organisation. The organisational managerial approach appears to have considerable consequences for an <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> programme as well as for the employees’ performance which, in turn, will affect customer satisfaction.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirically two distinctions {{of internal}} and external markets: influence activities and strategic coordination. Influence activities that arise from decentralization, imperfect monitoring, and a relative performance system are a potential liability of <b>internal</b> <b>markets,</b> coordination may be worse in <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> than in external markets. However, strategic coordination is an advantage of <b>internal</b> <b>markets,</b> a hierarchy can more effectively implement strategic policies in <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> than external markets. The {{results of this study}} show that profit center managers engage in influence activities by haggling over price adjustments, causing greater renegotiation costs in <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> than in comparable external markets. However, implementation of cost reduction, which is a strategic policy, appears to be more effective in <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> the results show that supplying profit centers disclose more private cost information than external market suppliers. Thus cooperation and competition appear to operate simultaneously in <b>internal</b> <b>markets.</b> In addition, the results suggest that <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> appear to undermine one advantage of a vertical integration strategy the creation of unique assets, as organizational resource that can generate rents. These results, which are based on data gathered from the <b>internal</b> and external <b>markets</b> of one Fortune 100 company, are exploratory and further work is needed to generalize the findings. comparative institutional performance, transaction costs, multidivisional corporation, hybrid organizations, influence activities...|$|R

In this exploratory study of the financial sector in Australia, involving a mail survey, current <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> practices are examined along with managers' perceptions of the concept. While definitions of <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> differ, the range of techniques used to achieve the goals commonly ascribed to <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> {{and the extent to}} which it is undertaken also seem to vary, with organisational size explaining some of these differences.

40|$|Despite over {{a decade}} of {{interest}} in <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> {{and the evolution of}} various approaches to its operationalisation, the potential benefits of an <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> campaign in improving the quality of service delivered to the customer have not been fully explored. This article focuses on the internal customer model of <b>internal</b> <b>marketing,</b> further developing the concept through a synthesis with service blueprinting (a method of representing the service delivery mechanism), to produce a new model of <b>internal</b> <b>marketing,</b> which can be readily applied to the service organisation. An exploratory investigation into the effect of applying this model of <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> to service quality is conducted. Changes in internal service quality are measured using a modification of the SERVQUAL model and external service quality is measured using the original SERVQUAL model. This exploratory study was undertaken in a medium sized UK service organisation, and found that service quality increased both internally and externally when this model of <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> was applied within the company. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{birth of}} <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> {{has its roots}} in the 1980 ’s and its purpose was to provide {{continuous}} and consistent satisfying service quality. The term <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> has been derived from the word ‘internal customers’ which was first used by Berry (1981). <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> deals with considering employees as internal customers and continuously selling their job to them to encourage better performance and better customer satisfaction. This thesis examines the depth of understanding and the applicability of <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> in the higher education sector which is not a conventional service industry. It also focuses on the relationship between perceptions of <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> and Organizational Commitment of the employees in the higher education sector. Many researchers use the definitions of <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> which focus too exclusively on service firms. Although there has been a continued blurring of lines between service and manufacturing firms in recent years, with more manufacturing firms talking about how good their ‘service’ has become, there are differences between service firms and others (Cahill, 1995). It is important to consider other organizations, like education, as providing services as well. While considering Education as a service provider, the marketer’s focus has been mainly on the external customers who in the case of higher education are the students. Considering and studying <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> in the higher education context is one of the main purposes of this research. The results of this study will help the Internal Marketers to understand and develop this concept which can cater for the universities. The results will also help the management staff of the universities in the context of raising awareness in <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing.</b> Secondly, the perceptions of Internal Marketers are as important as the perceptions of the receivers of the <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing.</b> This study uses a cross-sectional design of perceptions of both the appliers and the receivers of <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing.</b> Collecting data from two different groups of respondents gives a comprehensive understanding of the concept of <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> in a different context as mentioned in the literature review. This is a mixed methods study using the convergence model and data collected were 18 interviews and 181 surveys. The interviews were done with the Management staff and the surveys were administered to both Management and the Teaching staff. The qualitative results reveal that <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> is still at its infant stage and needs development in the universities. The quantitative data reveals that the difference between the perceptions of <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> between Management and Teaching staff is non-significant. The results also show that <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> has a weak correlation with the Organizational Commitment of the Employees in the universities...|$|R
