The aim of the present work was an experimental study of the flux decline in cross flow microfiltration of the filtered beer and aqueous solutions of model <b>foulants.</b> Ceramic membranes with two mean pore sizes of 200 and 500 nm were used. The used microfiltration stand enabled the cleaning of the membrane by back-flushing with the permeate.

Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), hydrochloric acid(HCl) were used as chemical agents respectively. Hydrophobicity, molecular weight distribution and metal ions of <b>foulants</b> in CCSM were analyzed as the major characters for membrane fouling. Results reveal that alkali cleaning can remove both hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of natural organic matters(NOM), and acid cleaning mainly removes hydrophilic organic matters. Medium molecular weight of very hydrophobic acids (1 - 10 kDa) and different molecular weight of neutral hydrophilic acids (100 - 1000 Da &> 300 kDa) in NOM can lead to membrane irreversible fouling. Acid cleaning is relatively effective for the reduction of inorganic <b>foulants.</b> The main metal ions in acid cleaning solutions are K,Ca, Al and Mn, which are responsible for membrane inorganic fouling...|$|R

They were Sleeve UV Transmittance (SUVT), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) combined with Energy Dispersive X-ray Microanalysis (EDX). It was verified that permanent <b>foulants</b> were trapped initially by the inherent holes and peaks on sleeve surfaces.

40|$|Inorganic mineral {{accumulation}} {{along the}} quartz sleeves that protect the ultraviolet (UV) lamps from water immersion {{has been observed}} as {{a major problem in}} UV photoreactor performance in water treatment process. Previous research has indicated that inorganic fouling is largely attributable to thermally-enhanced precipitation of metal-ligand pairs. Accumulation of these precipitates on the quartz surfaces that cause lamps reduces the transmission of UV radiation to the fluid that is being treated, thereby degrading reactor performance. ^ The central hypothesis of this research was that thermally-enhanced precipitation of metal:ligand pairs was responsible for fouling of quartz surfaces in UV photoreactors. Based on this hypothesis, a series of numerical models were developed to simulate the dynamics of fouling and its effect on process performance. ^ Analysis of the chemical composition and optical characteristics of <b>foulants</b> allowed identification of contributors to UV absorbance. A chemical equilibrium model was used to demonstrate that Fe(OH) 3 and MnO 2 among <b>foulants</b> are representative chemical forms for the two major <b>foulants.</b> Due to the availability of thermal properties from past research results, Fe was selected as a surrogate for Fe-based <b>foulants.</b> Calcium carbonate was also selected as a surrogate for Ca-based <b>foulants</b> because of the common observation of Ca mineral accumulation in fouling studies, even though Ca-based <b>foulants</b> do not appear to contribute significantly to UV absorbance. FLUENT coupled with GAMBIT were used as a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool to simulate the kinetics of the fouling reactions for calcium and iron based on a combined mass, heat, and momentum balance (i. e. multiphysics) approach. ^ The results of these two models were then incorporated into a third model to allow simulation of the effects of fouling on UV photoreactor performance. This model involved a modified intensity field submodel to account for the effects of <b>foulants</b> on the irradiance-field. This information was linked with simulated particle trajectories to develop a simulation of the UV dose distribution delivered by a reactor under a fouled condition. In turn, these results were applied to a segregated-flow model to simulate the effects of fouling on microbial inactivation. ^ The modeling tools developed in this research are intended to serve as aids in the design and application of UV-based photoreactors in water treatment. The information developed from these models will allow for a quantitative assessment of the potential for fouling to take place and its effect on process performance. ...|$|R

The flux performance for the mixed foulants was only weakly affected by solution pH and calcium concentration. These effects were likely due to the strong electrostatic attraction between the two oppositely charged foulants. Higher initial flux caused increased <b>foulant</b> deposition, more compact <b>foulant</b> layer, and more severe flux decline. The deposited <b>foulant</b> cake layer had a strong tendency to maintain a constant <b>foulant</b> composition that was independent of the membrane initial flux and only weakly dependent on the relative <b>foulant</b> concentration in feed solution.
