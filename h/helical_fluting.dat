40|$|The {{review of}} manufacturer's {{programs}} to make thread milling cutters {{has shown that}} most of milling cutters are produced with the <b>helical</b> <b>flutes</b> with the ω slope angle {{within the range of}} 10 ° [...] . 30 °. Thus, thread milling cutters, made of high speed steels, essentially, are not produced. In Russia there is GOST 1336 - 77, to regulate the parameters of thread milling cutter shaving with a straight flutes, made of high speed steels. It is established that available rake and clearance angles, and inclination angle of <b>helical</b> <b>flutes</b> at the accepted values of pitch and diameter of the tool lead to obtaining the angles of the tooth profile other than 30 degrees, thus requiring the calculation of angles β 1 and β 2 in each case of design. In the general case we have an asymmetrical profile with respect to the axis passing through the top of the tooth. Using the CATIA V 5 R 17 software, a geometric model that allows us to determine the angles of the tooth profile of thread milling cutter with <b>helical</b> <b>flutes</b> has been developed. The model research has been conducted for geometric and design parameters of thread milling cutter, made of cemented carbide and high speed steel. The paper presents a method for constructing models and key assumptions adopted for its development. Dependences are obtained for the model with a variation of the five factors (external diameter d, step profiles, P, rake γтц, clearance α, inclination angle of <b>helical</b> <b>flutes</b> ω) for thread milling cutters, made of cemented carbide and according to the model that extends the range of variation factors (d, P, γтц, ω) according to GOST 1336 - 77. Thus, this model to have the angles of the tooth profile of thread milling cutter with <b>helical</b> <b>flutes</b> can be used both to obtain the angles profile β 1 and β 2 {{in a wide range of}} varying tool parameters for all types of tool materials, and to broaden the possibilities for calculation of parameters according to GOST 1336 - 77. </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{thread accuracy}} in {{details of the}} machine-building production results from the improved design and manufacturing stages of threading tools. In modern industry, thread milling cutters gain an increasingly greater spread for thread manufacturing. Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} improving the accuracy of a cut thread is closely connected with the task of profiling the teeth of the thread milling cutters with <b>helical</b> <b>flutes,</b> and the accuracy of the solution depends on the face profile of the tool into the end section. In addition, the face profile of the tool is required to solve problems related to the calculation of strength thread milling cutters and evaluation of geometrical parameters of the teeth. The analysis of GOST 1336 - 77 on thread milling cutters showed that there are no geometric and structural parameters characterizing the end thread milling cutters with <b>helical</b> <b>flutes.</b> Since the standard presents thread milling cutters with a straight flutes, in which the shape of the tooth profile cutters of the second order is the same as in normal and end sections, for cutters with <b>helical</b> <b>flutes</b> it is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} conversion of normal and end sections to get the desired shape of the cutting edge. In order to assess the face profile, the end mills of high speed steel and carbide have been analyzed to show that the vast majority of the face profile of the tooth is specified in the normal section line, which is taken as an input in determining the function of the profile form for the face of the end section of the teeth thread milling cutter with <b>helical</b> <b>flutes.</b> The paper solves the problem of calculating the coordinates of the profile of the endsection of a tooth cutters with <b>helical</b> <b>flutes</b> adopted at the original tooth profile in normal section. It has been verified by modeling software CATIA V 5 R 17. An example illustrates finding the function form of the end section. Calculations have shown that in the end section of a tooth there is a curve described by a second-degree polynomial with a high degree of accuracy. The data obtained can be used to correct tooth profile thread milling cutters to improve the accuracy of the obtained thread. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring drilling, long stringy chips {{resulting}} from ductile plastic deformation of engineering materials cause severe chip clogging within the narrow <b>helical</b> <b>flutes</b> and edge chipping, leading to premature tool wear and breakage, poor tool life, poor hole {{quality and the}} productivity. Cutting fluid cannot efficiently access to the cutting edge that plays a vital role for improving machining performance. To address the localized heat and chip control issues during drilling, research was previously performed using conventional flood cooling, modified tool geometry, tool coating materials, and internal coolant via through hole(s). This works focuses on design and insertion of some obstruction-type chip breakers such as ribs and pins on the drill flutes and their influence on chip formation behavior. For feasibility experiments, small round pins made of stainless steel at a diameter of about 0. 8 - 0. 85 mm diameter are prepared and attached on the electro-discharge machined (EDM) blind holes on twisted drill flutes. By varying spindle speed and feed rate, drilling experiments are performed on two engineering materials including Al 6061 and Inconel 625 superalloys at four cutting conditions. Most chips {{are found to be}} broken and some split into two fractions due to the pins. Force and power values with pin-inserted drill bits were found to be reduced from 5 - 9 %.

According to the characteristics of these tools, 20270 data were established in the relational database. The SQL syntax was then utilized for writing the search algorithm, and the C++ Builder was employed for designing human machine interfaces of the search system of the tool database. Findings: A half of time on the tool design and the change of production line for grinding other types of tools can be saved by means of the proposed system. More specifically, the efficiency in terms of the overall machining time was improved up to 10. 58 %, 9. 36 %, 4. 64 %, and 7. 52 % for grinding the radius end mill, tapered radius end mill, twist drill, and step drill, respectively. Research limitations/implications: Special tools have diversification. They can not be taken into consideration in the database system owing to the tools have specific profiles. Therefore, it is difficult to encode by formal rules. Practical implications: The most commercial tool grinding software is the modular-based design and uses tool shapes to construct the CAM interface. However, it is very difficult for users to design new cutting tools. Utilizing the grinding processes to construct the grinding path of tools, and the search system of the database provides more flexible options to develop new cutting tools. Originality/value: The database and search system of cutting tools were presented in this paper. We can save time for production line change, tool design, and tool grinding by employing this kind of system. It also gives more convenience.

40|$|This device takes {{advantage}} of the centrifugal forces that are generated when a coring bit is rotated, and a granular sample is entered into the bit while it is spinning, making it adhere to the internal wall of the bit, where it compacts itself into the wall of the bit. The bit can be specially designed to increase the effectiveness of regolith capturing while turning and penetrating the subsurface. The bit teeth can be oriented such that they direct the regolith toward the bit axis during the rotation of the bit. The bit can be designed with an internal flute that directs the regolith upward inside the bit. The use of both the teeth and flute can be implemented in the same bit. The bit can also be designed with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. In another implementation, the bit can be designed to collect regolith primarily from a specific depth. For that implementation, the bit can be designed such that when turning one way, the teeth guide the regolith outward of the bit and when turning in the opposite direction, the teeth will guide the regolith inward into the bit internal section. This mechanism can be implemented with or without an internal flute. The device is based on the use of a spinning coring bit (hollow interior) as a means of retaining granular sample, and the acquisition is done by inserting the bit into the subsurface of a regolith, soil, or powder. To demonstrate the concept, a commercial drill and a coring bit were used. The bit was turned and inserted into the soil that was contained in a bucket. While spinning the bit (at speeds of 600 to 700 RPM), the drill was lifted and the soil was retained inside the bit. To prove this point, the drill was turned horizontally, and the acquired soil was still inside the bit. The basic theory behind the process of retaining unconsolidated mass that can be acquired by the centrifugal forces of the bit is determined by noting that in order to stay inside the interior of the bit, the frictional force must be greater than the weight of the sample. The bit can be designed with an internal sleeve to serve as a container for granular samples. This tube-shaped component can be extracted upon completion of the sampling, and the bottom can be capped by placing the bit onto a corklike component. Then, upon removal of the internal tube, the top section can be sealed. The novel features of this device are: center dot A mechanism of acquiring and retaining granular samples using a coring bit without a closed door. center dot An acquisition bit that has internal structure such as a waffle pattern for compartmentalizing or <b>helical</b> internal <b>flute</b> to propel the sample inside the bit and help in acquiring and retaining granular samples. center dot A bit with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. center dot A design that provides a method of testing frictional properties of the granular samples and potentially segregating particles based on size and density.
