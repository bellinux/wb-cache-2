Korn's compensation circuit allowed him to send still fax pictures by telephone or wireless between countries and even over oceans, while his circuit operated without benefit of electronic amplification. Korn's success at transmitting halftone still images suggested that such compensation circuits might work in television. Baird was the direct beneficiary of Korn's research and success.|$|E

The large size <b>image</b> <b>transmissions</b> cause bottlenecks in WSN due to the limited energy resources and network capacity. In this paper, we propose a collaborative <b>transmission</b> scheme for <b>image</b> sensors to utilize inter-sensor correlations to decide transmission patterns based on transmission path diversities, which achieves minimal energy consumption, balanced sensor lifetime and required image quality.

40|$|Segmented-based {{attenuation}} correction is now {{a widely}} accepted technique to reduce noise contribution of measured attenuation correction. In this paper, we present a new method for segmenting <b>transmission</b> <b>images</b> in positron emission tomography. This reduces the noise on the correction maps while still correcting for differing attenuation coefficients of specific tissues. Based on the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm, the method segments the PET <b>transmission</b> <b>images</b> into a given number of clusters to extract specific areas of differing attenuation such as air, the lungs and soft tissue, preceded by a median filtering procedure. The reconstructed <b>transmission</b> <b>image</b> voxels are therefore segmented into populations of uniform attenuation based on the human anatomy. The clustering procedure starts with an over-specified number of clusters followed by a merging process to group clusters with similar properties and remove some undesired substructures using anatomical knowledge. The method is unsupervised, adaptive and allows the classification of both pre- or post-injection <b>transmission</b> <b>images</b> obtained using 137 Cs single-photon sources into main tissue components in terms of attenuation coefficients. A high quality <b>transmission</b> <b>image</b> of the scanner bed is obtained from a high statistics scan and added to the <b>transmission</b> <b>image.</b> The segmented <b>transmission</b> <b>images</b> are then forward projected to generate new transmission sinograms {{to be used for}} attenuation correction in the reconstruction of the corresponding emission scan. The technique has been tested on a chest phantom simulating the lungs, heart cavity and the spine, the Rando-Alderson phantom, and whole-body clinical PET studies showing a clear reduction of noise propagation from transmission into emission data and allowing for reduction of transmission scan duration. Finally, the potential of the FCM method and its limitations as well as other prospective applications of the technique are discussed...|$|R
