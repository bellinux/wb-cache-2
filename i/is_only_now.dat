25|$|The 1990s saw the {{importance}} of television income to the sport continue to rise, and a battle for control of television rights led to the infamous Super League war, which saw the game split between rival competitions. This event affected the sport across the world {{during the middle of}} decade, and the damage done <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>now</b> being undone.|$|E
25|$|Nurses are {{required}} to have a critical care background; physicians are typically specialists in some field of medical specialty, often internists, surgeons or anaesthetists, although this background is not strictly required (though in some regione anaesthetists are the only physicians on ambulances or fly-cars). Emergency medicine <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>now</b> becoming slowly recognized as a medical specialty inside the hospital in Italy, {{and there are no}} real plans to create a subspecialty for pre-hospital care. Poor compensation and hours of work have reportedly resulted in a relatively high turnover rate among physicians in the system.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1990s, the {{government}} completed a comprehensive MR Environmental Management Plan (EMP) {{and received a}} US$250 million Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loan to help finance implementation of the EMP objectives. However, 12 years after {{the beginning of the}} project, the IDB had only disbursed US$10 million, and <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>now</b> committing another US$90 million for urgent clean-up activities (the remaining balance having been long reallocated). The Government of Argentina (GoA) concluded that the lack of an adequate institutional and legal framework to coordinate the involvement of different government jurisdictions has been a major obstacle to implementing the EMP.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>now</b> that Inigo Jones {{may have}} taken a firmer grip on his {{original}} ideas. Seeing De Caus' completed wing standing alone as an entirety, it was considered too plain â€“ De Caus' original plan was for the huge facade to have a low pitched roof, with wings finishing with no architectural symbols of termination. The modifications to the completed wing were of a balustrade hiding the weak roof line and Italianate, pavilion-like towers at each end. The focal point became not a portico but the large double height Venetian window. This south front (illustration above), has been deemed an architectural triumph of Palladian architecture in Britain, and {{it is widely believed}} that the final modifications to the work of De Caus were by Inigo Jones himself.|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} {{advocated}} for a reassessment of Hope's career. One is Chuck Berg, writing for Down Beat in 1980, who attributed the ignoring of Hope by most jazz fans and critics {{largely to the}} uniqueness of his style, which differed from that prevalent in jazz generally and in bebop in particular. Berg contrasted the [...] "aggressive assertiveness, massive outpourings of raw energy and displays of technical athleticism" [...] that, he argued, are valued in jazz, with Hope's more nuanced and intellectual approach, and suggested that the expansion of what is accepted in jazz since his death meant that his career should be re-evaluated. Seven years later, Palmer wrote on Hope and fellow pianist Herbie Nichols: [...] "they were practically categorized out of existence. Dismissed as second-stringers and copyists {{when they were both}} prolifically creative and highly original, they suffered a neglect that <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>now</b> beginning to be dispelled in the case of Nichols, and that still continues in the case of Hope." [...] In 2010 The Penguin Jazz Guide observed that, [...] "Like many of his piano generation, [...] work <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>now</b> being properly studied and appreciated." ...|$|E

2500|$|PON1 {{was first}} {{discovered}} through {{its ability to}} hydrolyse and therefore detoxify organophosphorus compounds which are widely used as pesticides and nerve gases.

2500|$|Modern {{taxonomy}} classifies {{life into}} three domains. The {{time of their}} origin is uncertain. The Bacteria domain probably first split off from the other forms of life (sometimes called Neomura), but this supposition is controversial. Soon after this, by 2 Ga, the Neomura split into the Archaea and the Eukarya. Eukaryotic cells (Eukarya) are larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells (Bacteria and Archaea), and the origin of that complexity <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>now</b> becoming known.|$|E

Frank Granito of Speiser Krause noted that [...] "the rewards in the US are more substantial {{than anywhere else in}} the world but nobody has questioned the fee whilst the work has been going on, it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>now</b> as we approach a resolution when the criticism comes your way." ...|$|E

2500|$|... (1) Engraving by hand is {{the oldest}} and most obvious method of engraving, but is the least used at the present time on account of its slowness. The design is {{transferred}} to the roller from an oil colour tracing and then merely cut out with a steel graver, prismatic in section, and sharpened to a beveled point. It requires great steadiness of hand and eye, and although capable of yielding the finest results it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>now</b> employed for very special work and for those patterns that are too large in scale to be engraved by mechanical means.|$|E

2500|$|Further wrangles {{effectively}} brought work on {{the north}} side of Leipziger Platz to a complete stop for several years; even now there are some [...] "fake facades" [...] where completed new buildings should be, while a long-running dispute over who owned the Wertheim department store site (or had claims to the revenue from its sale by the government), left another large gap in the central Berlin cityscape that <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>now</b> finally being redeveloped. This development, known as Leipziger Platz 12, is a large complex with facades in three streets (Leipziger StraÃŸe, WilhelmstraÃŸe and VossstraÃŸe) as well as Leipziger Platz itself, and when completed will contain 270 stores, 270 apartments, a hotel, a fitness centre and offices. However, this development brought about the demise (after several stays of execution), of the legendary Tresor nightclub and centre for techno music. Founded on 8 Mar 1991 in the basement strongrooms of the former Wertheim store's bank, these having survived the decades largely undamaged, the club finally closed on 16 April 2005 (it later reopened on 24 May 2007 in a renovated power plant on KÃ¶penicker StraÃŸe).|$|E
