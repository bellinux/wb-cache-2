2500|$|A {{review of}} VanderWaal's album Just the Beginning in USA Today noted: [...] "VanderWaal's big-throated {{performance}} on 'A Better Life' channels Florence Welch and Miley Cyrus. There's a certain chirp in VanderWaal's voice that’s reminiscent of Swift, but otherwise, her vocals align much {{more closely to}} Sia's in her full-voiced belting and nonchalant pronunciations. ... VanderWaal sounds like a 13-year-old in her songs, {{in the best possible}} way. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> sounds refreshingly green, she launches herself at huge choruses with a total lack of restraint." [...] A reviewer for The Buffalo News wrote that the [...] "vast diversity in her songwriting ... makes her stand out as a truly unique and exquisite artist." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{an episode}} of the PBS series Jean Shepherd's America, the Chicago-born Shepherd told of {{how he and his}} father (Jean Shepherd, Sr.) would watch Chicago White Sox games from the right field upper deck at Comiskey Park in the 1930s. On one occasion, the Sox were playing the Yankees, and Shepherd Sr. had been taunting Gehrig, yelling at him all day. In the top of the ninth, with Sox icon Ted Lyons holding a slim lead, Gehrig came up with a man on base, and the senior Shepherd yelled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> echoed around the ballpark, [...] "Hit one up here, ya bum! I dare ya!" [...] Gehrig did exactly that, hitting a {{screaming}} liner, practically into the heckler's lap, for the eventual game-winning home run. Shepherd's father was booed mercilessly, and he never again took junior Jean to a game. He apparently told this story originally when Gehrig's widow was in the audience at a speaking engagement.|$|E
2500|$|... he Review took a vocal role in contesting the Vietnam War. ... Around 1970, {{a sturdy}} {{liberalism}} began to supplant left-wing radicalism at the paper. As Philip Nobile observed in ... 1974 ... the Review {{returned to its}} roots and became [...] "a literary magazine on the British nineteenth-century model, which would mix politics and literature in a tough but gentlemanly fashion." ... The publication has always been erudite and authoritative – and because of its analytical rigor and seriousness, frequently essential – but it hasn't always been lively, pungent and readable. ... But the election of George W. Bush, combined with the furies of 9/11, jolted the editors. Since 2001, the Review's temperature has risen and its political outlook has sharpened. ... Prominent [...] the Review ... charged into battle not only against the White House but against the lethargic press corps and the [...] "liberal hawk" [...] intellectuals. ... In stark contrast to The New Yorker ... or The New York Times Magazine ..., the Review opposed the Iraq war <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> was remarkably consistent and unified.|$|E
