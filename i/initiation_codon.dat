2500|$|The {{right side}} of a positive-sensed AAV genome encodes {{overlapping}} sequences of three capsid proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3, which start from one promoter, designated p40. The molecular weights of these proteins are 87, 72 and 62 kiloDaltons, respectively. All {{three of them are}} translated from one mRNA. After this mRNA is synthesized, it can be spliced in two different manners: either a longer or shorter intron can be excised resulting in the formation of two pools of mRNAs: a 2.3 kb- and a 2.6 kb-long mRNA pool. Usually, especially in the presence of adenovirus, the longer intron is preferred, so the 2.3-kb-long mRNA represents the so-called [...] "major splice". In this form the first AUG codon, from which the synthesis of VP1 protein starts, is cut out, resulting in a reduced overall level of VP1 protein synthesis. The first AUG codon that remains in the major splice is the <b>initiation</b> <b>codon</b> for VP3 protein. However, upstream of that codon in the same open reading frame lies an ACG sequence (encoding threonine) which is surrounded by an optimal Kozak context. This contributes to a low level of synthesis of VP2 protein, which is actually VP3 protein with additional N terminal residues, as is VP1.|$|E

To verify whether these GUG and CUG codons {{could be used}} as additional <b>initiation</b> <b>codons</b> of translation, two chimeric constructs were built for directing the synthesis of either Rex–CAT or Tax–CAT fusion proteins. In both cases, the CAT reporter sequence was inserted after the Tax AUG codon and in frame with either the Rex or Tax AUG codon. Under transient expression of these constructs, other proteins of higher molecular mass were synthesized in addition to the expected Rex–CAT and Tax–CAT proteins. The potential non-AUG <b>initiation</b> <b>codons</b> were exchanged for either an AUG codon or a non-initiation codon. This allowed us to demonstrate that the two GUG codons in frame with the Rex coding sequence, and only the second CUG in frame with the Tax coding sequence, were used as additional <b>initiation</b> <b>codons.</b> In HTLV-I infected cells, two Rex and one Tax additional proteins were detected that exhibited molecular mass compatible {{with the use of the}} two GUG and the second CUG as additional <b>initiation</b> <b>codons</b> of translation. Comparison of the HTLV-I proviral DNA sequence with that of other HTLV-related retroviruses revealed a striking conservation of the three non-AUG <b>initiation</b> <b>codons,</b> strongly suggesting their use for the synthesis of additional Rex and Tax proteins...|$|R

To achieve a comprehensive and accurate annotation of Deinococcus deserti genome, we performed an N-terminal-oriented characterization of its proteome. For this, we used a labeling reagent, N-Tris(2, 4, 6 -trimethoxyphenyl) phosphonium acetyl (TMPP), to selectively derivatize protein N-termini. The large scale identification of TMPP-modified Nterminal- most peptides by a shotgun liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis led to the validation of 278 and correction of 73 translation <b>initiation</b> <b>codons</b> in D. deserti genome. In addition, four new genes were detected, three located on the main chromosome and one on plasmid P 3.

40|$|In the {{integrated}} stress response, phosphorylation of eIF 2 α (eIF 2 α-P) reduces protein synthesis while concomitantly promoting preferential translation of specific transcripts associated with stress adaptation. Translation of the glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase gene EPRS is enhanced {{in response to}} eIF 2 α-P. To identify the underlying mechanism of translation control, we employed biochemical approaches to determine the regulatory features by which upstream ORFs (uORFs) direct downstream translation control and expression of the EPRS coding region. Our findings reveal that translation of two inhibitory uORFs encoded by noncanonical CUG and UUG <b>initiation</b> <b>codons</b> in the EPRS mRNA 5 '-leader serve to dampen levels of translation initiation at the EPRS coding region. By a mechanism suggested to involve increased translation initiation stringency during stress-induced eIF 2 α-P, we observed facilitated ribosome bypass of these uORFs, allowing for increased translation of the EPRS coding region. Importantly, EPRS protein expression is enhanced through this preferential translation mechanism in response to multiple known activators of eIF 2 α-P and likely serves to facilitate stress adaptation {{in response to a}} variety of cellular stresses. The rules presented here for the regulated ribosome bypass of noncanonical <b>initiation</b> <b>codons</b> in the EPRS 5 '-leader add complexity into the nature of uORF-mediated translation control mechanisms during eIF 2 α-P and additionally illustrate the roles that previously unexamined uORFs with noncanonical <b>initiation</b> <b>codons</b> can play in modulating gene expression...|$|R
40|$|SummaryProduced {{from the}} {{pathogenicity}} islands of Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates, stable SprG 1 RNA encodes two peptides {{from a single}} internal reading frame. These two peptides accumulate at the membrane, and inducing their expression triggers S.  aureus death. Replacement of the two <b>initiation</b> <b>codons</b> by termination signals reverses this toxicity. During growth, cis-antisense RNA SprF 1 is expressed, preventing mortality by reducing SprG 1 RNA and peptide levels. The peptides are secreted extracellularly, where they lyse human host erythrocytes, a process performed more efficiently by the longer peptide. The two peptides also inactivate Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, with the shorter peptide more effective against S.  aureus rivals. Two peptides are secreted from an individual RNA containing two functional <b>initiation</b> <b>codons.</b> Thus, we present an unconventional type I toxin-antitoxin system expressed from a human pathogen producing two hemolytic and antibacterial peptides from a dual-coding RNA, negatively regulated by a dual-acting antisense RNA...|$|R

Unexpectedly, a single IRES module is therefore responsible for translation initiation at four distantly localized codons.

40|$|Kar 4 p is a {{transcription}} factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{that is required}} for the expression of karyogamy-specific genes during mating, for the efficient transit from G 1 during mitosis, and for essential functions during meiosis. Kar 4 p exists in two forms: a constitutive slower-migrating form, which predominates during vegetative growth, and a faster-migrating form, which is highly induced by mating pheromone. Transcript mapping of KAR 4 revealed that the constitutive mRNA was initiated upstream of two in-frame ATG <b>initiation</b> <b>codons,</b> while the major inducible mRNA originated between them. Thus, the two forms of Kar 4 p are derived from the translation of alternative transcripts, which possess different AUG <b>initiation</b> <b>codons.</b> Site-directed mutations were constructed to inactivate {{one or the other of}} the <b>initiation</b> <b>codons,</b> allowing the expression of the two Kar 4 p forms separately. At normal levels of expression, the constitutive form of Kar 4 p did not support wild-type levels of mating. However, the two forms of Kar 4 p could also be expressed separately from the regulatable GAL 1 promoter, and no functional difference was detected when they were expressed at equivalent levels. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the induced form of Kar 4 p was highly expressed and stable during mating but rapidly turned over in vegetative cells. In contrast, the constitutively expressed longer form showed the same rate of turnover regardless of the growth condition. Furthermore, overexpression of either form of Kar 4 p in vegetative cells was toxic. Thus, the elaborate regulation of the two forms of Kar 4 p at the levels of transcription, translation, and protein turnover reflects the requirement for high levels of the protein during mating and for low levels during the subsequent phases of the cell cycle...|$|R

Analysis of the transcription of the gene showed the presence of two potential translation <b>initiation</b> <b>codons</b> in some ALATS mRNAs. Translation from the upstream AUG would generate an N-terminal extension with features characteristic of mitochondrial targeting peptides. A polyclonal antibody raised against part of the Arabidopsis AlaRS revealed that the Arabidopsis cytosolic and mitochondrial AlaRSs are immunologically similar, suggesting that both isoforms are encoded by the ALATS gene. In vitro experiments confirmed that two polypeptides can be translated from AlATS transcripts, with most ribosomes initiating on the downstream AUG to give the shorter polypeptide corresponding in size to the cytosolic enzyme. The ability of the presequence encoded between the two <b>initiation</b> <b>codons</b> to direct polypeptides to mitochondria was demonstrated by expression of fusion proteins in tobacco protoplasts and in yeast.
