The {{proposal}} {{of this paper}} is to provide a simple angular random-walk model to build up polypeptide structures, which encompass properties of dihedral angles of folded proteins.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel stochastic approach to image denoising using an adaptive Monte Carlo scheme. Random samples are {{generated from the}} image field using a spatially-adaptive importance sampling approach. Samples are then represented using <b>Gaussian</b> <b>probability</b> <b>distributions</b> and a sample rejection scheme is performed based on a χ 2 statistical hypothesis test.

Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method provides superior noise suppression performance both quantitatively and qualitatively when compared to the state-of-the-art image denoising methods. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Map Building (SLAM) {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} problems in robot navigation. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is widely adopted in SLAM approaches, requires extensive computation. The conventional particle filter also needs intense computation to cover a high dimensional state space with particles. This paper proposes an efficient SLAM method based on the recursive unscented Kalman filtering in an environment including a large number of landmarks. The posterior <b>probability</b> <b>distributions</b> of the robot pose and the landmark locations are represented by their marginal <b>Gaussian</b> <b>probability</b> <b>distributions.</b> In particular, the posterior <b>probability</b> <b>distribution</b> of the robot pose is calculated recursively. Each landmark location is updated with the recursively updated robot pose. The proposed method reduces filtering dimensions and computational complexity significantly, and has produced very encouraging results for navigation experiments with noisy multiple simultaneous observations...|$|R

We prove that the graphical criterion is sound and complete in certain sense. We argue that our assumptions are not too restrictive.

A simple phase diagram is obtained within the replica-symmetric approximation, presenting an instability of the paramagnetic solution at low temperatures.

Three first-order critical frontiers are found and they all meet at a triple point; among such lines, two of them present discontinuities in the order parameters, but no latent heat, whereas the other one exhibits both discontinuities in the order parameters and a finite latent heat.

40|$|We {{present a}} new family of models {{that is based on}} graphs that may have un{{directed}}, directed and bidirected edges. We name these new models marginal AMP (MAMP) chain graphs because each of them is Markov equivalent to some AMP chain graph under marginalization of some of its nodes. However, MAMP chain graphs do not only subsume AMP chain graphs but also multivariate regression chain graphs. We describe global and pairwise Markov properties for MAMP chain graphs and prove their equivalence for compositional graphoids. We also characterize when two MAMP chain graphs are Markov equivalent. For <b>Gaussian</b> <b>probability</b> <b>distributions,</b> we also show that every MAMP chain graph is Markov equivalent to some directed and acyclic graph with deterministic nodes under marginalization and conditioning on some of its nodes. This is important because it implies that the independence model represented by a MAMP chain graph can be accounted for by some data generating process that is partially observed and has selection bias. Finally, we modify MAMP chain graphs so that they are closed under marginalization for <b>Gaussian</b> <b>probability</b> <b>distributions.</b> This is a desirable feature because it guarantees parsimonious models under marginalization.
