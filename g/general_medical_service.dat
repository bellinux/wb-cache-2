5000|$|Prior to the Second World War {{there was}} already {{consensus}} that health insurance should be extended to the dependants of the wage-earner, and that the voluntary and local authority hospitals should be integrated. A British Medical Association (BMA) pamphlet, [...] "A <b>General</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> for the Nation" [...] was issued along these lines in 1938. However, no action was taken due to the international crisis. During the war, a new centralised state-run Emergency Hospital Service employed doctors and nurses to care for those injured by enemy action and arrange for their treatment in whichever hospital was available. The existence of the service made voluntary hospitals dependent on the Government {{and there was a}} recognition that many would be in financial trouble once peace arrived. The need to do something to guarantee the voluntary hospitals meant that hospital care drove the impetus for reform.|$|E

40|$|We studied whether pharmacists {{involved}} in dis-charge planning can improve patient satisfaction and outcomes by providing telephone follow-up after hospital discharge. We conducted a randomized trial at the <b>General</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> {{of an academic}} teaching hospital. We enrolled General Medical Ser-vice patients who received pharmacy-facilitated dis-charge from the hospital to home. The intervention consisted of a follow-up phone call by a pharmacist 2 days after discharge. During the phone call, phar-macists asked patients about their medications, in-cluding whether they obtained and understood how to take them. Two weeks after discharge, we mailed all patients a questionnaire to assess satisfaction with hospitalization and reviewed hospital records. Of the 1, 958 patients discharged from the <b>General</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> from August 1, 1998 to March 31, 1999, 221 patients consented to participate. We ran-domized 110 to the intervention group (phone call) and 111 to the control group (no phone call). Patients returned 145 (66 %) surveys. More patients in the phone call than the no phone call group were satis-fied with discharge medication instructions (86 % vs. 61 %, P 0. 007). The phone call allowed pharmacists to identify and resolve medication-related problems for 15 patients (19 %). Twelve patients (15 %) con-tacted by telephone reported new medical problems requiring referral to their inpatient team. Fewer pa-tients from the phone call group returned to the emergency department within 30 days (10 % phone call vs. 24 % no phone call, P 0. 005).

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To assess {{changes in}} general practitioners' {{workload}} {{associated with the}} new contract introduced in April 1990. DESIGN [...] Weekly workload diary completed during four weeks in February-March 1990 and {{during the same period}} in 1991. SETTING [...] Sheffield, United Kingdom. SUBJECTS [...] All 300 general practitioners on Sheffield Family Health Services Authority list as principals in 1990 and 1991. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Mean number of hours worked per week, number of patients seen each week, and mean time spent per patient. RESULTS [...] 181 (60 %) general practitioners responded in 1990 and 163 (54 %) in 1991. Of these, 18 (10 %) were not working in 1990 and 14 (7 %) in 1991. <b>General</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> work increased during a "normal working week" from a mean of 38. 6 hours a week in 1990 to 40. 6 hours in 1991, and non-general medical service work decreased from 5. 4 hours a week to 4. 5 hours. Hours spent on call were similar before and after the contract. For the 99 general practitioners who responded in both years, time spent on <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> duties increased significantly (40. 5 h in 1990 v 42. 5 h [corrected] in 1991; p = 0. 033), mainly due to more time being spent in clinics. Significantly more patients were being seen in clinics (9 v 14; p = 0. 001); the average time spent per patient remained at about 8 1 / 2 minutes during surgeries and 16 minutes for a home visit, and rose from 13 to 14 minutes for patients seen in clinics. The time spent on practice administration fell but not significantly. CONCLUSION [...] Since the new contract there has been a significant increase in general medical services work, mainly due to more patients being seen in clinics, with no reduction in the time spent per patient...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{discrepancy}} {{between the number of}} admissions and the allocation of hospital beds means many patients admitted under the care of a <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> can be placed in other departments’ wards. These patients are called “outliers” and their outcomes are unknown. Aims: To examine the relation between the proportion of time each patient spent in their “home ward” during an index admission and the outcomes of that hospital stay. Methods: Data from Flinders Medical Centre’s (FMC) patient journey database were extracted and analysed. The analysis was carried out on the patient journeys of patients admitted under the General Medicine units. Results: Outlier patients’ length of stay (LOS) was significantly shorter than that of the inlier patients (110. 7 hours cf 141. 9 hours; p < 0. 001). They had a reduced risk of readmission within 28 days of discharge from hospital. Outlier patients’ discharge summaries {{were less likely to be}} completed within a week (64. 3...|$|E

30|$|Formality and {{understandability}} of ontology-based representation {{for medical}} services have been researched in (Huser et al. 2010; Mabotuwana & Warren 2009). The authors of (Mabotuwana & Warren 2009) propose a framework to indentify hypertensive patients who satisfy evidence-based criteria for quality improvement potential. They propose three issues for domain-modelling: (i) shareability, (ii) extensibility, and (iii) easy visualization {{of knowledge base}} for domain-modelling. On the other hand, the authors of (Huser et al. 2010) establish a query system of electoric health record data based on flowchart that indicates processes to treat patients. The authors propose an trade-off problem of readability and expressiveness of query representation. The authors of (Huser et al. 2010; Mabotuwana & Warren 2009) focus on how to represent queries correctly and/or easily {{on the basis of}} considerably restricting the domain of the querie, and their approaches are not easy to extend for evaluation of <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> quality. This paper enhances formality and understandability of QI-RS by MSO that provides sufficient vocabulary words to define quality indicators and by establishing a general framework of ontology-based graph representation.|$|E
40|$|Delirium is a neuropsychiatric sindrome {{characterized}} by acute onset, a fluctuating course, an altered level of consciousness, disturbances in orientation, memory, attention, thinking, perception and behaviour. One third of patients aged 70 or older were {{admitted to the}} <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> of an acute care hospital experience delirium. The development of delirium is associated with worse outcome increased a 10 -fold risk for death and a 3 - to 5 -fold risk for nosocomial complications, prolonged length of stay, and greater need for nursing home placement after discharge. Therefore patients with delirium have higher morbidity and mortality rates, higher re-admission rates, and {{a greater risk of}} long term institutionalization care, thereby having a significant impact on both health and social care expenditure. The cost of delirium to the health-care system is then substantial. Despite its clinical importance and health-related costs, it often remains under-recognized and inadequately managed. Recent evidence suggests that a better understanding and knowledge of delirium among health care professionals can lead to early detection, the reduction of modifiable risk factors, and better management of the condition in the acute phase...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews four studies {{sponsored}} by the Department of Health which have attempted to measure workload in general practice and compares these with data from the general household survey. Despite the considerable differences in the objectives and methods employed by the four studies, they were found to contain remarkably consistent measurements of general practitioner workload. In a 'normal working week' general practitioners spend 38 hours on <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> duties (including 24 hours of patient contact and five hours of travel to home visits), they see 150 patients or their representatives in surgery, and make 26 home visits. In an 'annual average week', taking into account holidays and sick leave, general practitioners undertake 90 % of this workload. The studies show consistently large variations in the workload of general practitioners measured in this way, but fail to identify the key determinants of such variations. The reasons underlying the variation in general practitioner workload will remain unclear until we can distinguish between the expected, measurable variation and the residual, unexplained variation which {{may be due to}} the personal preferences of general practitioners...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The prevalence, burden, and {{management}} of insomnia among primary care pa-tients were evaluated. Method: Consecutive patients aged 18 to 65 years in primary care clinics of a staff-model health maintenance organization (N= 1, 962) were screened with the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire. A stratified random sample (N= 373) completed face-to-face diagnostic assessments including the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, a brief self-rated disability questionnaire (Brief Disability Questionnaire), and the interviewer-rated Social Disability Schedule. A telephone follow-up survey was completed 3 months later. Use of psychotropic drugs, use of mental health services, and direct health care costs were assessed by using the health plan’s automated data systems. Results: Approximately 10 % of the primary care patients reported major current insomnia (e. g., taking at least 2 hours to fall asleep nearly every night). Current insomnia was associated with significantly greater functional impairment (according to both Brief Disability Questionnaire and Social Disability Schedule), more days of disability due to health problems, and greater <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> utilization. While insomnia was associated with depressive disorder and chronic medical illness, adjustment for these factors only partially accounted for the association of insomnia with disability and wit...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{establish}} Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) {{scores that}} correspond to well-established cut-points on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: <b>General</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> of a large teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 75 and older (N = 199; mean age 84, 63 % female). MEASUREMENTS: The MoCA (range 0 - 30) and the MMSE (range 0 - 30) were administered within 2 hours of each other. The Abbreviated MoCA (A-MoCA; range 0 - 22) was calculated from the full MoCA. Scores from the three tests were analyzed using equipercentile equating, a statistical method for determining comparable scores on different tests of a similar construct by estimating percentile equivalents. RESULTS: MoCA scores were lower (mean 19. 3 +/- 5. 8) than MMSE scored (mean 24. 1 +/- 6. 6). Traditional MMSE cut-points of 27 for mild cognitive impairment and 23 for dementia corresponded to MoCA scores of 23 and 17, respectively. CONCLUSION: Scores on the full and abbreviated versions of the MoCA can be linked directly to the MMSE. The MoCA may {{be more sensitive to}} changes in cognitive performance at higher levels of functioning...|$|E
