Like all American locomotives produced at the time, the Baldwins had 'short' lifespans built into them but the NZR were happy to re-boiler almost their whole fleet to give them a longer life of hard work. NZR were generally happy with their Baldwin fleet. A private Railway operating in New Zealand at the time exclusively purchased Baldwin products after facing the same difficulties with British builders the NZR had. The Wellington and Manawatu Railway (1881-1909) operated small fleets of 2-8-0(4), 2-6-2(6), 2-8-2(1), 4-6-0(2) and a large 2-8-4(1) tank locomotive. When the NZR took over the railway, its fleet was absorbed into sub-classes of those operating already in the main fleet. When NZR placed tenders for Diesel locomotives in the 1950s, Baldwins applied but failed when EMD won the contract instead. Surprisingly only one NZR Baldwin product is operational, a class Wd 2-6-4 tank locomotive operating at the Ferrymead railway in Christchurch, the remains of a WMR 2-6-2 N, NZR 4-6-0 Ub, and two NZR 2-6-2 Wb tank locomotives are in the early stages of restoration.|$|E

Physical measures {{were collected from}} two trumpet performers and used to construct a computer model of the instrument/performer. Using this model, several works composed by both trumpet virtuosi and non-trumpet players were analyzed. A conceptual distinction is made between measures of performance difficulty (how {{hard it is to}} play a particular passage) and measures of performance idiomaticism (how well suited a passage is to a specific instrument). Methods for characterizing both difficulty and idiomaticism are described. In general, the results suggest that detailed modeling of the mechanics of performance can help to pinpoint aspects of musical organization that arise from performance idioms or affordances.

40|$|AbstractMilk {{and dairy}} {{products}} are typical examples of high pressure homogenized commodities. High pressure homogenization is therefore a well established process and realized at around 10 Mio tons {{per year in the}} dairy industry. Milk {{and dairy products}} are homogenized to improve product properties such as color, consistency, taste, creaming stability, creaminess and mouthfeel [1]. The basic idea of high pressure homogenization is to pressurize an emulsion premix up to several hundred bars and then pump it through a disruption system (full stream homogenisation). State of the art as disruption systems are <b>flat</b> <b>valves.</b> Besides conventional <b>flat</b> <b>valves</b> a simple or complex orifice type of valves like the interaction chamber of Microfluidics® may also serve as disruption system [2]. Within the talk, different disruption systems will be compared with regard to disruption effectiveness and power efficiency. As high pressure is required for droplet disruption into the submicron range high investment, energy and maintenance costs result from high pressure homogenization processes. The product active ingredients are subjected to intense mechanical and thermal stresses. Problems in term of costs, maintenance and ingredient degradation may be overcome by a novel micro-structured orifice called “Simultaneous Emulsification and Mixing” (SEM) [3], which will be presented {{in the second part of}} the talk. It combines the two unit operations ‘mixing’ and ‘emulsification’ in one single process unit, which results in significant energy and cost reduction, product quality improvement and process intensification. For this, an additional stream (e. g skim milk for dairy processes) is injected directly into the droplet disruption zone of a high-pressure disruption system. The design of these SEM-valves is based on CFD simulations of local flow conditions. The fabrication of the valve is realized with micro process engineering tools. The influences of product and process parameters on energy efficiency and product quality are discussed for the dairy process...|$|R

The same technique was employed on five animal feed samples. A new model of homogenizer equipped with ceramic homogenizing valve was evaluated in terms of analyte metal contamination levels within the final sample dispersion. Five animal feed samples and four wood pulp samples, were investigated for their content of Cu, Fe and Mn using high-pressure homogenization as the sample preparation technique prior to GF-AAS.

40|$|A plastic {{micropump}} {{which can}} be produced using conventional production techniques and materials is presented. By applying well-known techniques and materials, economic fabrication of micropumps for various applications is feasible even at low production volumes. The micropump is capable of pumping both liquid and gas at a considerable high pump rate and is self-priming, which means that it can start pumping gas in a dry state and automatically fills with liquid. Pump rates, at actuation frequencies between 2 and 500 Hz, were around 2 ml/min for water and up to 50 ml/min for air. A differential pressure of 1. 25 × 104 Pa (125 cm water column) was reached. Basically, the micropump consists of two parts, a <b>flat</b> <b>valve</b> assembly with two passive membrane valves and an actuator placed on top. The valves were made by sandwiching a punched thin polymer film between two plastic valve parts containing the valve seats. The latter parts are made by reactive injection molding of an epoxy resin. Two types of actuators have been applied to drive the pump; an electromagnetic actuator consisting of a magnet placed in a coil and secondly a disk. The first actuator, when combined with a flexible polymer pump membrane, showed a very large pump rate for gas, up to 40 ml/min at the resonant frequency of the actuator system. A disadvantage of the electromagnetic actuator was the relatively large volume occupied by the coil giving the micropump final dimensions of 10 × 10 × 8 mm 3. Application of the piezoelectric actuator reduced these dimensions down to 12 × 12 × 2 mm 3 with comparable performance...|$|E

Its branchlets are sparsely covered with hairs when young. Its leaves are alternate, leathery, obovate to elliptic, generally 5 to 11 cm long and 2 to 4 cm wide, with 15 to 20 pairs of inconspicuous and nearly parallel lateral veins which is a helpful diagnostic feature in the field. The apex of each leaf is short acuminate and the base is broadly cuneate, with entire and smooth margins. Its flowers are yellowish green, fragrant, in a terminal or axillary umbel. The fruit is a woody obovoid capsule with an outer covering of short grey hairs, 2.5 to 3 cm long, opening in two <b>flat</b> <b>valves</b> when ripen.

40|$|Two {{perceived}} {{limitations of}} conventional atomic spectrometry were addressed in these studies. One limitation {{is that the}} time required for sample preparation can exceed the actual analysis time by two or more orders of magnitude. High pressure homogenization in combination with high speed blending was evaluated for the preparation of slurries which could be directly analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF-AAS). Cadmium, copper and lead concentrations were successfully determined in certified reference materials (CRMs) of biological origin and frozen cervine liver and kidney. By capping the <b>flat</b> <b>valve</b> head of the homogenizer with a ruby disc, metal contamination introduced by the processing was reduced appreciably (but not eliminated) and the procedure was extended to the determination of chromium, iron, manganese and nickel in botanical CRMs and air dried animal feeds. The one problematic analyte element proved to be selenium which was consistently underestimated with this procedure. However, the combination of high pressure homogenization and partial enzymatic digestion with a crude protease alone or admixed with lipase or cellulase, released Se-residues from zoological and botanical CRMs so that Se could be accurately determined by slurry introduction GF-AAS. This technique was also applied successfully to freeze-dried, fresh and boiled fish tissues. The principal advantages of the slurry preparation technique are its speed, simplicity and lack of operator intervention. The second limitation involved the loss of chemical speciation information during analysis. To preserve this speciation information, individual chemical species were separated chromatographically then detected in the column eluate using a novel all silica T-tube interface coupled with AAS. The advantages of the current interface design over previous prototypes were the compatibility with both organic or aqueous mobile phases and the low limits of detection (LODs) for Ag, Cd, Cu or Zn. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated by monitoring levels of metal analyte bound to individual metallothionein isoforms which had been partially resolved by size exclusion or ion exchange HPLC. Whereas the metallothionein-I (MT-I) isoform was enriched in Cu relative to the MT-II isoform, the reverse was true for Zn. Also, a Ag-saturation procedure rapidly and efficiently replaced the bound Cd, Cu and Zn in these polypeptides...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 49 - 52). Currently {{many patients}} die {{because of the}} end-stage heart failure, mainly due to the reduced number of donor heart transplant organs. Studies show that a permanent left ventricular assist device (LVAD), a battery driven pump which is surgically implanted, increased the survival rate of patients with end-stage heart failure and improved considerably their quality of life. The inlet conduit of the LVAD {{is attached to the}} left ventricle and the outflow conduit anastomosed to the ascending aorta. The purpose of LVAD support is to help a weakened heart to pump blood {{to the rest of the}} body. However LVAD can cause some alterations of the natural blood flow. When your blood comes in contact with something that isn't a natural part of your body blood clots can occur and disrupt blood flow. Aortic valve integrity is vital for optimal support of left ventricular assist LVAD. Due to the existence of high continuous transvalvular pressure on the aortic valve, the opening frequency of the valve is reduced. To prevent the development of aortic insufficiency, aortic valve closure during LVAD implantation has been performed. However, the closed aortic valve reduces wash out of the aortic root, which causes blood stagnation and potential thrombus formation. So for this reason, there is a need to minimize the risks of occurring blood clot, by having more knowledge about the flow structure in the aorta during LVAD use. The current study focuses on measuring the flow field in the aorta of the LVAD assisted heart with two different types of aortic valve (Flat and Finned) using the SDSU cardiac simulator. The pulsatile pump that mimics the natural pulsing action of the heart also added to the system. The flow field is visualized using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Furthermore, The fluid mechanics of aorta has been studied when LVAD conduit attached to two different locations (proximal and distal to the aortic valve) with pump speeds of 8, 000 to 10, 000 revolutions per minute (RPM). As LVAD speed increases, the velocity of the defined area (close to the proximal anastomosis) increases linearly but inversely the stagnation index decreases. We observed that with Finned valve attachment, the stagnation value is lower than the <b>flat</b> <b>valve</b> so the results suggest that D 1 valve has lower risk of thrombosis close to the aortic valve...|$|E

Special attention was then dedicated to the complete monitoring of high resolution ([Ba]/[Ca]) shell profiles in bivalve shells (7 years, Bay of Brest) to better constrain environmental processes influencing both the occurrence and the amplitude of summer peaks. In 2000, seawater Ba analyses underlined significant particulate Ba inputs at the seawater interface (SWI) during ([Ba]/[Ca]) shell peak events. These Ba inputs are suggested to be subsequent to and rather induced by a pelagic biogenic process. The long term survey revealed first that archived Ba within the shell cannot be used as a direct paleo productivity tracer, and second that complex pelagic/benthic processes in the Ba cycle are responsible of particulate Ba inputs to the SWI, subsequently taken up by the bivalve and recorded as higher ([Ba]/[Ca]) shell ratios.

The Bay of Brest (France) was investigated in particular because of its long term observations on scallop communities, environmental variables, and high resolution analyses of dissolved Mo in bottom seawater in 2000. In 2000, dissolved Mo exhibited a significant increase in concentration just preceding the maximum ([Mo]/[Ca]) (shell) ratio. Both the intense monitoring survey in 2000 and over the 7 -year period indicates that the ([Mo]/[Ca]) (shell) maximum is directly influenced by spring changes of environmental conditions at the sediment water interface (SWI), occurring subsequent to the intense and periodic spring bloom. Spring maxima of ([Mo]/[Ca]) (shell) ratios are closely correlated to the extent of silicic acid and nitrate depletion in seawater between winter and late spring (r(2) = 0. 878 and 0. 780, p < 0. 05, n= 6) that reflects diatom uptake and productivity in the Bay of Brest. The Mo inputs in bottom waters and subsequent shell enrichment are thus suggested to be directly or indirectly influenced by such biogenic material input at the SWI.

The [Mo]/[Ca]) shell ratios exhibit typical profiles characterized by a background content, below the detection limit for this method (&lt; 0. 003 &mu;mol/mol) {{for most of the}} shell growth period, which is punctuated by a significant transient enrichment (0. 031 – 2. 1 &mu;mol/mol) mainly occurring from May to June. The Bay of Brest (France) was investigated in particular because of its long term observations on scallop communities, environmental variables, and high resolution analyses of dissolved Mo in bottom seawater in 2000. In 2000, dissolved Mo exhibited a significant increase in concentration just preceding the maximum ([Mo]/[Ca]) shell ratio. Both the intense monitoring survey in 2000 and over the 7 -year period indicates that the ([Mo]/[Ca]) shell maximum is directly influenced by spring changes of environmental conditions at the sediment water interface (SWI), occurring subsequent to the intense and periodic spring bloom. Spring maxima of ([Mo]/[Ca]) shell ratios are closely correlated to the extent of silicic acid and nitrate depletion in seawater between winter and late spring (r 2 = 0. 878 and 0. 780, pn= 6) that reflects diatom uptake and productivity in the Bay of Brest. The Mo inputs in bottom waters and subsequent shell enrichment are thus suggested to be directly or indirectly influenced by such biogenic material input at the SWI. The [Mo]/[Ca]) shell records thus reveal unexpected biogeochemical cycles of Mo influenced by coastal spring productivity, faithfully recorded in scallop shells...|$|R
50|$|Isocrania {{is round}} to ovate, up to 1 cm in diameter, and has 15-65 strong ribs, that start at ±½mm from {{the origin of}} growth (or umbo). These ribs may extend beyond {{the edge of the}} valves. The umbo is not {{precisely}} in the centre of the valve. The attachment area is smaller than usual, and virtually absent in adults of later species. The dorsal valve is conical, the ventral <b>valve</b> <b>flat</b> to conical, flatter for adolescents and earlier species. The inner edge of the valves is flattened and grainy.|$|R
2500|$|In Valve's early days, the company's {{structure}} {{was similar to}} other development firms; this was principally driven {{by the nature of}} physical game releases through publishers that required tasks to be completed by given deadlines, requiring a more regimented structure. As the company moved to digital releases where they serve as their own publisher, the company structure has become more as a <b>flat</b> organization. <b>Valve</b> published their employee handbook to the public in 2012, demonstrating at that time that outside of executive management, there were no bosses, and the company used an open allocation system, allowing employees to move between departments at will. This approach allows employees to work on whatever interests them, but requires them to take ownership of their product and mistakes they may make, according to Newell. Newell recognized that this structure works well for some but that [...] "there are plenty of great developers for whom this is a terrible place to work".|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a program to {{investigate}} and characterize seal materials suitable for space shuttle storable propellant systems are given. Two new elastomeric materials were identified as being potentially superior to existing state-of-the art materials for specific sealing applications. These materials were AF-E- 124 D and AF-E- 411. AF-E- 124 D is a cured perfluorinated polymer suitable for use with dinitrogen tetroxide oxidizer, and hydrazine base fuels. AF-E- 411 is an ethylene propylene terpolymer material for hydrazine base fuel service. Data are presented relative to low and high temperature characteristics as well as propellant exposure effects. Types of data included are: mechanical properties, stress strain curves, friction and wear characteristics, compression set and permeability. Sealing tests with a <b>flat</b> poppet-seal <b>valve</b> were conducted for verification of sealing capability. A bibliography includes over 200 references relating to seal design or materials and presents a concise tabulation of the more useful seal design data sources...|$|R
