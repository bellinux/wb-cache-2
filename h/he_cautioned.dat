5|$|With several {{influential}} committee posts, Neal {{has made}} economic policy {{the focus of}} his career, although his success has been mixed. He served his first two terms on the House Banking Committee, where he served on the Financial Services Subcommittee. As the banking reform law of 1991 was being drafted, <b>he</b> <b>cautioned</b> that President George H.W. Bush's proposal could negatively affect small businesses and minority-owned businesses. He introduced an amendment to require reports on lending to these businesses, which was adopted.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and neurological studies surfaced that were relevant to determining the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made frequently. As the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by Kevin Kelly to each formulate a more precise definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that their beliefs could be scientifically verified. While Carr firmly believed that his skepticism about the Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted, <b>he</b> <b>cautioned</b> in both his essay and his book The Big Switch that long-term psychological and neurological studies were required to definitively ascertain how cognition develops {{under the influence of}} the Internet.|$|E
25|$|Jang Se-yul {{supported}} the {{claims that the}} North Korean state was behind the Sony hacking incident. <b>He</b> <b>cautioned</b> that the U.S. should take the North Korean cyberwarfare threat more seriously.|$|E
50|$|In the essay, Lem {{criticizes the}} {{contemporary}} literary theory, in particular, with Roman Ingarden's Literary Work of Art, and proceeds with his own. <b>He</b> <b>cautions</b> that <b>he</b> deals {{only with the}} ontological side of the issue, disregarding the esthetical side of literature.|$|R
5000|$|Frederick Neumann [...] {{notes the}} trill {{following}} the dotted preparation is a main-note trill (that is, starting on the written note), and <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> against {{use of the}} term as a general descriptor for dotted alternation as a prelude to a trill.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{want you}} to take your time with it," [...] <b>he</b> <b>cautions.</b> [...] "Pay {{attention}} to the language itself. The ideas. Don't think in terms of a beginning and an end. Because unlike some plot-driven entertainments, there is no closure in real life. Not really." ...|$|R
25|$|Lynch indicated, like Cuinet, {{that there}} was a seemly {{deliberate}} Ottoman policy of under counting. Nonetheless, Lynch figures were well circulated, but <b>he</b> <b>cautioned</b> the reader regarding the misleading character of the term “Muslim” since many Armenians converted and were counted as Muslim, while they were still practicing Armenian Christians.|$|E
25|$|The {{placement}} of Jackson on the $20 bill {{may be a}} historical irony; as president, he vehemently opposed both the National Bank and paper money and made the goal of his administration {{the destruction of the}} National Bank. In his farewell address to the nation, <b>he</b> <b>cautioned</b> the public about paper money.|$|E
25|$|On August 9, Smith {{informed}} Bragg that he {{was breaking}} the agreement and intended to bypass Cumberland Gap, leaving a small holding force to neutralize the Union garrison, and to move north. Unable to command Smith to honor their plan, Bragg focused on a movement to Lexington instead of Nashville. <b>He</b> <b>cautioned</b> Smith that Buell could pursue and defeat his smaller army before Bragg's army could join up with them.|$|E
500|$|<b>He</b> <b>cautions</b> {{that while}} the Cylinder is [...] "clearly linked {{with the history of}} Iran," [...] it is [...] "in no real sense an Iranian document: {{it is part of a}} much larger history of the ancient Near East, of Mesopotamian kingship, and of the Jewish diaspora." ...|$|R
40|$|Dr. Baker {{says that}} the ban will be lifted next Wednesday if {{conditions}} continue to improve• Dr. Baker believes that the influenza epidemic has about run its course in Louisville. Still, <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> the public to be careful. Flare-ups of the disease are expected throughout the winter. Newspaper article...|$|R
50|$|One panelist, Ricardo de Lorenzo, {{pointed out}} that {{lengthened}} lifespans could increase the importance of advance directives (and {{the frequency with which}} they are needed). However, <b>he</b> <b>cautions,</b> healthcare workers are already often uncertain about how to use these, and end-of-life decisions often cause legal and ethical dilemmas.|$|R
25|$|Hans Brunner, an Australian hair analyst, {{compared}} the hairs {{to those of}} other primates and local animals and suggested that they originated from a previously undocumented species of primate. Dr. Todd Disotell, a biological anthropologist from New York University, performed DNA analysis on the hairs and found nothing but human DNA in the sample. <b>He</b> <b>cautioned,</b> however, that contamination by people who handled the hairs could have introduced this DNA or that the original DNA could have decomposed.|$|E
25|$|Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel, then Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel, {{was asked}} to rule on the {{validity}} of this ban. He acknowledged {{the right of the}} community to refuse to carry out conversions and to regard as invalid conversions carried out by other communities in which marriage is a factor. At the same time, <b>he</b> <b>cautioned</b> that persons converted out of genuine conviction and recognized by established rabbinic authorities should not be regarded as non-Jewish, even if they were not allowed to join the Syrian community.|$|E
25|$|French {{genuinely}} {{hoped for}} a breakthrough at Neuve Chapelle (10–12 March 1915) and personally briefed the cavalry commanders Allenby and Rimington beforehand, although, aware {{of the effect of}} modern firepower on cavalry, <b>he</b> <b>cautioned</b> Rimington against getting too close to the enemy. He believed that victory would prove to Kitchener that British efforts should be concentrated on the Western Front, {{and that it would be}} merely a prelude to a much larger Battle of Lille. French moved to a forward headquarters at Hazebrouck during the battle.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{surprising}} findings of the 2011 census was {{the extent to which}} white British people have opted to leave London. Eric Kaufmann explores the possibility that we are seeing ‘white flight’ from London, though <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> against jumping to conclusions in the absence of sufficient empirical evidence...|$|R
50|$|The second {{covering}} letter provides Moses of Ingila’s response. He {{says that the}} writing {{is a piece of}} wisdom literature whose inner meaning has to be carefully discerned. <b>He</b> <b>cautions</b> the anonymous monk to be careful. As he is about to disclose its Christological meaning, the text is cut off.|$|R
25|$|Peter-Paul Verbeek, a {{professor}} of philosophy of technology at the University of Twente, Netherlands, writes that technology already influences our moral decision making, which in turn affects human agency, privacy and autonomy. <b>He</b> <b>cautions</b> against viewing technology merely as a human tool and advocates instead to consider it as an active agent.|$|R
25|$|Jung {{emphasized}} the importance of balance and harmony. <b>He</b> <b>cautioned</b> that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. Jackson Pollock, for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.|$|E
25|$|Linstead {{proved a}} {{moderate}} MP. He joined the Tory Reform Committee and in October 1944 welcomed {{the report of}} the Beveridge Committee on social insurance. He was particularly supportive of moves to create a national health service; <b>he</b> <b>cautioned</b> that the administration must be kept efficient. At the 1945 general election, Linstead faced a five-cornered fight against not only Labour and Liberal candidates but also Sir Richard Acland, the leader of Common Wealth and Mrs. E. Tennant, a former Conservative candidate now standing as an Independent. Linstead won a majority of 3,887.|$|E
25|$|The album's {{original}} mix, {{recorded in}} Detroit at both Hitsville and Golden World {{as well as}} United Sound Studios, was finalized on April 5, 1971. When Gordy listened to the mix, <b>he</b> <b>cautioned</b> Gaye of the album's potential of possibly alienating Gaye's core fan base, which was mostly women; however, Gaye refused to budge. Gaye and his engineers did a new sound mix of the album at The Sound Factory in West Hollywood in early May, integrating the orchestra somewhat closer with the rhythm tracks. Though Motown's Quality Control department team feared no other hit released from the album due to its concurrent style with each song leading to the next, Gordy surprisingly allowed this mix to be released that month.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{a meeting}} {{with a group of}} homesteaders whom <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> against trying to farm on the Mesa Verde: [...] "God made that land for the buffalo. it serves pretty well for cattle. But it hates the plow! And even the {{government}} should know you can't farm six thousand feet above sea level!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Even as the Western Roman empire collapsed, literate men {{acknowledged}} that Virgil {{was a master}} poet. Gregory of Tours read Virgil, whom he quotes in several places, along with some other Latin poets, though <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> that [...] "we ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death." ...|$|R
50|$|Even {{in light}} of this evidence, Grimme concludes that pi {{stacking}} does indeed exist. However, <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> that smaller rings, particularly those in T-shaped conformations, do not behave significantly differently from their saturated counterparts, and that the term should be specified for larger rings in stacked conformations which do seem to exhibit a cooperative pi electron effect.|$|R
25|$|In The Atlantis Secret, Alford {{underlined}} {{the importance}} of cataclysms in ancient Greek myth and suggested that the Greek gods had inherited many characteristics from the older Mesopotamian deities. <b>He</b> <b>cautioned,</b> however, that the ancients’ belief in exploded planets did not require an actual explosion. Instead, he drew {{on the work of}} Victor Clube and Bill Napier to suggest that comets, fireballs and meteorites had been closely observed at the dawn of civilisation, and that the ancient sages had deduced an exploded planet, correctly or incorrectly, from first principles; the sages had then attributed the great cataclysm to the beginning of time. It should be noted, here, that there is an implied criticism of Velikovsky’s historicist interpretation of cataclysm myths.|$|E
25|$|Minister of the Interior Otar Khetsia stated on 21 November that {{criminal}} cases had been opened {{by law enforcement}} agencies in Gagra and Aradu. He noted that Azhiba's car had stood along the road at a far distance from his home, and while he confirmed that fire had broken out, <b>he</b> <b>cautioned</b> that {{it was up to}} the investigation to establish whether the car had exploded or been set fire to. Khetsia also confirmed that a warehouse for kiwifruit had burned down in Aradu, and that everything would be done to find the perpetrators, but he expressed his surprise at the fact that reporters from Abaza TV (owned by Butba) had been at the crime scene before officers from the Ochamchira police department.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with economic analyst and commentator Neil Cavuto on Fox News Channel, June 26, 2007, in speaking of income tax resistance, Paul said that he supports the right of those who engage in nonviolent resistance when they believe a law is unjust, bringing up the names of Martin Luther King, Jr., Lysander Spooner, and Mahatma Gandhi as examples of practitioners of peaceful civil disobedience; but <b>he</b> <b>cautioned</b> that those who do {{should be aware that}} the consequences could be imprisonment. He said that current income tax laws assume that people are guilty and they must then prove they are innocent, and he believes this aspect of tax law is unfair. However, he said that he prefers to work for improved tax laws by getting elected to Congress and trying to change the laws themselves rather than simply not paying the tax.|$|E
50|$|The Dodgers put Ferrara to work {{in their}} {{community}} relations department in July 2009. He visits elementary schools and reads Dr. Seuss books to the kids; <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> teens about the evils of alcohol, tobacco and drugs; and he entertains guests at some Dodger home games. He lives with his companion of over 35 years, Kay Donno.|$|R
5000|$|Borella {{sees the}} case as telling drafters of patents (and perhaps patent claims) to {{describe}} ’how an invention improves over the prior art, especially if it improves the operation of a computer." [...] <b>He</b> <b>cautions,</b> however, that [...] "for purposes of avoiding estoppel, one should be careful when pointing out the deficiencies of what came before." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the book, Levitin {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} evaluating numbers, something that people fear, he asserts, but can cause people to be misled. <b>He</b> <b>cautions</b> that [...] "statistics are not facts." [...] Numbers, statistics, charts and graphs can (inadvertently or by design) be skewed to fit particular points of view {{and should not be}} taken at face value.|$|R
500|$|Several {{songs on}} Diorama were {{inspired}} by Johns' then-girlfriend Natalie Imbruglia, but <b>he</b> <b>cautioned</b> against possible misinterpretations of the songs, stating [...] "Everyone will think that any lyric that's about someone {{in a positive light}} will be about her" [...] and noting that there were other people he cared for about whom he wrote the songs. Johns denied rumours that he had written songs intending Imbruglia to sing them.|$|E
500|$|Whitehead's most {{complete}} work on {{education is the}} 1929 book The Aims of Education and Other Essays, which collected numerous essays and addresses by Whitehead on the subject published between 1912 and 1927. [...] The essay from which Aims of Education derived its name was delivered as an address in 1916 when Whitehead {{was president of the}} London Branch of the Mathematical Association. [...] In it, <b>he</b> <b>cautioned</b> against the teaching of what he called [...] "inert ideas" [...] – ideas that are disconnected scraps of information, with no application to real life or culture. [...] He opined that [...] "education with inert ideas is not only useless: it is, above all things, harmful." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Reid's piece {{appeared}} in The Observer on 25 September 1994. This is [...] "one {{of the most}} peculiar stories of the year", <b>he</b> <b>cautioned</b> readers. [...] "Peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine {{is going to have}} trouble believing a word of it. Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth." [...] "It took about two hours for that cash to go up in flames", he added. [...] "I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation I know they are capable of this." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} part of the fourth season, <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> Londo not to speak out against Emperor Cartagia after the arrival of the Shadow fleet on Centauri Prime. He claims (correctly, as the {{audience}} later finds out) that Cartagia has a desk upon which he has the heads of former cabinet ministers who disagreed with him, arranged in a row.|$|R
50|$|Vasu and Viji meet up and one day, Vasu {{follows her}} on her two wheeler. She is so bugged by him that she fails to notice a vehicle ahead. Though <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> her, she ends up having an accident. Vasu admits her in the hospital, but Viji holds him {{responsible}} for her accident. Both of them are at loggerheads and bicker constantly.|$|R
5000|$|One {{of the few}} {{positive}} reviews {{came from}} Michael Booth of the Denver Post. He described the concept as [...] "The Truman Show meets Con Air" [...] and makes positive notes about the reality television aspects of the story, although <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> readers not to expect [...] "high art" [...] based on the 3 star rating he gives the film.|$|R
