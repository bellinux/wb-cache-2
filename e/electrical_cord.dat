25|$|On {{the night}} of May 31, 2001, Bill Hackert and his {{daughter}} Christine of Rotterdam, New York died when their house caught fire and a First Alert ionization smoke detector failed to sound. The cause of the fire was a frayed <b>electrical</b> <b>cord</b> behind a couch that smoldered for hours before engulfing the house with flames and smoke. The ionization smoke detector {{was found to be}} defectively designed, and in 2006 a jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York decided that First Alert and its parent company, BRK Brands, was liable for millions of dollars in damages.|$|E

25|$|After Harrison's {{body was}} found, a $10,000 reward was placed for {{information}} about the abductor, which showed composite sketches of the perpetrator. None was arrested until two years later. In 1984, 44-year-old Robert Anthony Buell, employed by the state of Ohio, kidnapped a 28-year-old woman while she was working as a manager at an Ohio gas station in Damascus, Ohio. The woman's head was shaved, she was shocked with a severed <b>electrical</b> <b>cord,</b> beaten and was bound to Buell's bed and raped. She was able to escape, twelve hours later, fearing for her life, and ran to a nearby house and notified police after her attacker had left to go to work. Such a man had previously preyed on Ohio women, who were usually in their late twenties to forties.|$|E
500|$|However, the U.S. Marshals Service still {{lists the}} escapees as wanted fugitives and have [...] "Wanted" [...] posters for each man. A 2014 {{study of the}} ocean {{currents}} by scientists at Delft University and the research institute Deltares indicates that a craft leaving Alcatraz at 11:30 pm on June 11, 1962, would most likely have landed {{just north of the}} Golden Gate Bridge and indicate that debris would have washed up on Angel Island, consistent with where it was actually found. A 2015 History Channel documentary presented further circumstantial evidence gathered over the years by the Anglin brothers' family, including Christmas cards allegedly sent by the brothers for three years after their escape. [...] It featured an interview with family friend Fred Brizzi, who claimed to have met the brothers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1975. To support his story, he offered a photograph of two men resembling John and Clarence Anglin, taken, he said, during the encounter. The documentary also presented an alternate escape theory involving the use of an <b>electrical</b> <b>cord,</b> which was reported missing from the prison's dock, tied to a passenger ferry that left the island just after midnight {{on the night of the}} men's escape.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to Manchester Central railway station, where she waited outside in the car while he {{selected}} their victim. After a few minutes Brady reappeared {{in the company of}} Edward Evans, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. After they had driven back home and relaxed over a bottle of wine, Brady sent Hindley to fetch her brother-in-law. When they got back to the house Hindley told Smith to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for [...] "the miniature wine bottles". Brady led Smith into the kitchen and left him there, saying {{that he was going to}} collect the wine. A few minutes later, Smith heard a scream, followed by Hindley shouting loudly for him to come and help. Smith entered the living room to find Brady repeatedly striking Evans with the flat of an axe, and watched as he then throttled Evans with a length of <b>electrical</b> <b>cord.</b> Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own—Brady had sprained his ankle in the struggle—so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.|$|E

[...] According to Wood, Pennington said or did [...] "something very minor" [...] that in Red Dog's homicidal state was enough to enrage him. Red Dog tied his wrists and ankles with duct tape and <b>electrical</b> <b>cord,</b> and forced him to lie on {{his back on the}} floor, then cut his throat. [...] According to prosecutors he took off his boots so they wouldn't be stained with blood. He nearly decapitated Pennington with his knife; the wound was 6 inches deep.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, the National Christmas Tree had a Bicentennial theme. [...] The {{tree was}} {{decorated}} with 4,600 red, white, and blue lights; red, white, and blue ornaments, and silver garland; and topped by a [...] high gold and green Liberty Bell. The low-watt Christmas tree lights were specially designed by General Electric. In {{a circle around the}} National Christmas Tree were 13 tall evergreen trees, symbolizing the Thirteen Colonies. An additional 47 smaller trees formed the Pathway to Peace, representing the rest of the states, U.S. territories, POW/MIAs, and senior citizens. The 12,000 total light bulbs and [...] of <b>electrical</b> <b>cord</b> used 40 percent less wattage than the year before.

[...] That year's Pageant of Peace was also truncated, presenting live entertainment only through December 23. However, there were now 60 trees in the Pathway to Peace.|$|E

Lead-based coloring agents {{are used in}} ceramic glazes and glass, especially for red and yellow shades. Lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry. Lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of <b>electrical</b> <b>cords.</b> It {{can be used to}} treat candle wicks to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of its toxicity, European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc. Lead glass is composed of 12–28% lead oxide, changing its optical characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation. Lead-based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead selenide are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors.|$|R
