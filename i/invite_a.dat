5|$|Cameron {{later told}} a BBC {{documentary}} {{that he had}} not expected to become Prime Minister, and the coalition agreement had not yet been completed when Brown resigned. Speaking on the programme, Five Days That Changed Britain, broadcast on 29 July, he said that when he went to meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the coalition deal had not been finalised. Formally, the monarch can only <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> prospective Prime Minister to form a Government; the shape of the Government is for the new Prime Minister to decide. William Hague said that as Cameron travelled to the Palace, the coalition agreement was still being completed and signed.|$|E
5|$|In 1381 the Peasants' Revolt {{broke out}} in England, during which Gaunt was {{targeted}} by the rebels as an especially hated member of the administration. He found himself stranded {{in the north of}} England {{in the early part of}} the revolt but considered Dunstanburgh insufficiently secure to function as a safe haven, and was forced to turn to Alnwick Castle instead, which refused to let him in, fearing that his presence would <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> rebel attack.|$|E
5|$|Vizzini {{offered to}} meet with Aldisio – who had been {{appointed}} High Commissioner in August 1944 – to solve the island’s grain problem, implying he {{had the power to}} do so. There is no evidence that Aldisio and Vizzini ever met to discuss the issue. Aldiso did, however, <b>invite</b> , <b>a</b> fellow Christian Democrat and Mafia member befriended by Vizzini, to secret gatherings with Christian Democrats. The meetings were seen as a first step in a government alliance with the Mafia. Aldisio’s appointment was perceived by Mafia chieftains as a first indication of the government’s determination to subdue the separatist movement. They were now forced to reconsider their support.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, {{the club}} was {{purchased}} by London Clubs, who moved their premises from the Devonshire Club on St James's Street to {{the basement of the}} Ritz. A new company was formed in June 1998, the Ritz Hotel Casino Ltd., which was granted legal permission to open a casino. After very quick refurbishment, it reopened on 12 September with exclusive membership, although members are permitted to <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> guest. As of 2006 the Ritz Club was divided into four main areas—the restaurant, bar, lounge and the private gaming room, situated in the former Banqueting Hall. In July 2014, London High Court heard a case against the club, in which Nora Al-Daher claimed she was 'taken advantage' of and asked for £2 million in losses.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} a heroine {{moving to a}} strange place where {{she does not know}} the local {{language}} is replicated in Ratnam's later films, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). The heroine has a dilemma; because she does not know the language in Delhi she can barely socialise with local people, and she is at loggerheads with the only person with whom she can relate. According to Rangan, the restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya is the first instance in Tamil cinema where a man invites a woman for a cup of coffee. He compared it to Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam said that he was inspired by the Doors and the Beatles and, although it was not uncommon to <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> woman for a cup of coffee, it was not reflected in the Tamil cinema of the time.|$|E

25|$|About 41% of the Malagasy are Christian. They {{are divided}} almost evenly between Roman Catholic and Protestant, {{but there are}} also Orthodox Christians. Many {{incorporate}} the cult of the dead with their other religious beliefs and bless their dead at church before proceeding with the traditional burial rites. They also may <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> pastor to attend a famadihana. A historical rivalry exists between the predominantly Catholic masses, considered to be underprivileged, and the predominantly Protestant Merina aristocrats, who tend to prevail in the civil service, business, and professions.|$|E
25|$|Although Lee {{seemed to}} <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> {{full-scale}} reconsideration {{of the doctrine}} of sovereign immunity, subsequent Supreme Court decisions in Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corporation, 337 U.S. 682 (1949) and Malone v. Bowdoin, 369 U.S. 643 (1962) sharply limited the impact of the Lee Court's decision. Larson and Malone specifically carved out only two areas in which an officer of the United States may be sued: 1) If the officer acts outside her or his legally prescribed scope of authority, or 2) If the officer acts {{in a way that is}} unconstitutional.|$|E

25|$|During Bográn's {{brief time}} in office, {{he had agreed}} to a United States {{proposal}} to <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> United States financial adviser to Honduras. Arthur N. Young of the Department of State was selected for this task and began work in Honduras in August 1920, continuing to August 1921. While there, Young compiled extensive data and made numerous recommendations, even persuading the Hondurans to hire a New York police lieutenant to reorganize their police forces. Young's investigations clearly demonstrated the desperate need for major financial reforms in Honduras, whose always precarious budgetary situation was considerably worsened by the renewal of revolutionary activities.|$|E
25|$|Bửu Hội {{outlined}} {{a plan to}} the United States' representatives to the United Nations to avoid a full-scale debate on South Vietnam in the General Assembly. He revealed that South Vietnam would reject a formal inquiry mission as interference in domestic affairs, but would try to seize the initiative to <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> fact finding mission. He reasoned that such a delegation would spark a rapprochement in Vietnam and would delay debate and condemnation by the Assembly until the mission had tabled its report. Privately he asked the Americans to tell Thích Trí Quang {{that he would not}} do anything to harm the Buddhist's cause.|$|E

Shironamhin recalls all the members & persons who worked for Shironamhin once and forever, expressed their gratitude to those who carried shironamhin this long & dedicated their songs to the listeners whom shironamhin is comfortable to call friends.

25|$|After the Conservative {{government}} tabled {{its fiscal}} update, NDP leader Jack Layton asked his predecessor, Ed Broadbent, to contact former Liberal prime minister Jean Chrétien {{to discuss a}} coalition to oust the Conservatives from power. The plan became public almost immediately. Labelling {{the absence of an}} economic stimulus plan as irresponsible and the removal of public funding to parties as an attack against democracy, the opposition threatened to topple the weeks-old government by voting against the fiscal update. The opposition parties counted on the probability that Governor General Michaëlle Jean would <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> Liberal-NDP coalition able to hold the confidence of the House of Commons to form a government, instead of any other options available to her.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{half the}} Malagasy {{population}} practice Christianity, with practitioners of Protestantism slightly outnumbering adherents to Roman Catholicism. Today, many Christians integrate {{their religious beliefs}} with traditional ones related to honoring the ancestors. For instance, they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> Christian minister to consecrate a famadihana reburial. Islam is practiced by around 7% of the population, with practitioners largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of Mahajanga and Antsiranana. The vast majority of Muslims are Sunni and are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity, Indians, Pakistanis and Comorians. More recently, Hinduism was introduced to Madagascar through Gujarati people immigrating from the Saurashtra region of India in the late 19th century.|$|E
25|$|If {{military}} veterans or {{active duty}} soldiers are present, they often carry the flags and eagle staffs. They {{are followed by}} the head dancers, then the remaining dancers usually enter the arena in a specific order: Men's Traditional, Men's Grass Dance, Men's Fancy, Women's Traditional, Women's Jingle, and Women's Fancy. Teens and small children then follow in the same order. Following the Grand Entry, the MC will <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> respected {{member of the community}} to give an invocation. The host drum that did not sing the Grand Entry song will then sing a Flag Song, followed by a Victory or Veterans' Song, during which the flags and staffs are posted at the MC's table.|$|E

25|$|But it was {{the site}} where that second piece of {{information}} led us that contained dynamite. From a description provided by our source, I had easily identified the building in question, which was located in Baghdad's downtown Aadamiyah section. The ten crates of missile parts were stashed in a basement of the Baghdad headquarters of Saddam's own Ba'ath party. If we could achieve surprise and surround the site before the Iraqis could evacuate the crates, we would obtain the ultimate catch-22 situation: let us inside as promised and we would find the prohibited material; bar our entry and violate the Kofi Annan compromise, {{and in the process}} <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> devastating air strike by the United States. UNSCOM would be prepared to camp out around this site until the situation had been resolved one way or the other.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{repression}} {{of identity and}} the inability to practice their culture and language has led the Talysh to an internalized self repression. This {{makes it hard to}} gauge support for any type of Talysh movement. According to Hema Kotecha, many Talysh fear being associated with the separatist Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic, with Russia, or with Armenia if they acknowledged or attempted to talk about their beliefs in the public sphere. One instance of current repression was when a school in Lerik wanted to <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> poet from Lenkoran to have a party in his honor and for him to speak to Children; the headmaster was told that he would be dismessed if the event went ahead. The fear of the police is also another factor to this silence, although support for a secular democracy and shared Azerbaijani-Talysh feelings towards Nagorno-Karabakh contribute as well.|$|E
25|$|To {{boost the}} park attendance, Hong Kong Disneyland {{introduced}} Summer Passes in summer 2006 {{to attract more}} visitors. Each Summer passholder could visit the park unlimitedly throughout summer 2006 for just HK$450. The park also provided exclusive treats for the Summer Passholder in the summer holidays {{to encourage them to}} visit the park several times, such as extending the operating hours of Fantasyland for passholders and releasing limited pins for passholders to purchase. Apart from these, the park offered free tickets to the friends and family members of the cast members. Each cast member can <b>invite</b> <b>a</b> limited number of friends and family members to visit Disneyland every day during the summer. Although the park had sold more than 60,000 Summer Passes throughout summer 2006, the park missed its target of 5.6million in its first year, with only about 5.2million guests entering the park {{during the first year of}} operation. The government overestimated Hong Kong Disneyland's attendance numbers during the Asian Financial Crisis. Rumour suggested that the relatively low-key celebration of the 1st Anniversary was due to the disappointing performance of the theme park.|$|E
