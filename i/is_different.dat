5|$|All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have {{substantial}} atmospheres because their gravity {{is strong enough}} to keep gases close to the surface. The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space. The composition of Earth's atmosphere <b>is</b> <b>different</b> from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Although Wordsworth {{places a}} similar {{emphasis}} on living {{in harmony with}} nature in his poetry, Coleridge's view <b>is</b> <b>different</b> from that of Wordsworth's in that he believed that nature represents a physical presence of God's word; this is combined with a Neoplatonic understanding of God that emphasises the {{need to understand the}} divine in order to embrace it.|$|E

5|$|Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager {{indicates}} that “Thumbelina” {{was the first}} of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings of one who <b>is</b> <b>different,</b> and, as a result of being different, becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to incorporate the swallow as the symbol of the poetic soul and Andersen’s identification with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble.|$|E
5|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} a variety of lung diseases, {{including}} lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can also cause cancer of the pleura, called mesothelioma (which <b>is</b> <b>different</b> from lung cancer).|$|E

He also performed it the following year on 1 April 1725, in his second cycle of Leipzig cantatas, a cycle of chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. It followed in the cycle some forty newly composed cantatas.

[...] Another critic from The Hindu, B. Kolappan, called the performances of the lead cast [...] "excellent". D. Karthikeyan of The Hindu wrote in December 2009 that Aval Appadithan would [...] "remain etched in every film lover's memory by showing the best of Rajnikanth's acting skills."

Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.|$|E
5|$|Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain {{mathematician}} Virasena {{is credited}} with a precursor to the binary logarithm.

This definition gives rise to a function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two, but it <b>is</b> <b>different</b> for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies have}} an odour {{described}} variously as resembling garlic, radish, lemon, onion, or skunk, and taste like radish. Although some older sources report P.squarrosa as edible, the mushroom has caused several cases of poisoning. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with the mushroom, then experienced vomiting and diarrhoea about ten hours later. The toxic effect {{may be due}} to the combination of eating the mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended time delay between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity <b>is</b> <b>different</b> than the antabuse-effect experienced from Coprinopsis atramentaria with alcohol.|$|E
