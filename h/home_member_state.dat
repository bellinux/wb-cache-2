40|$|The European Union's 1999 Financial Services Action Plan (the FSAP), {{an ambitious}} reform agenda of forty-two measures, was {{designed}} to provide the regulatory underpinning for a single deep and liquid capital market, in which pan-EU market actors are regulated by their <b>home</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> under harmonized rules. This single capital market would {{lower the cost of}} capital, unlock funding sources for companies, and increase returns on savings, while widening choice and stimulating competition in the pan-EU financial services industry. After a surge of legislative activity over the last months of 2003 and through early 2004, the FSAP is on track for timely completion in mid- 2004, as called for by the March 2003 Brussels European Council.

Furthermore, the creation of political parties at supranational level will enable Union citizens to express freely their ideas and undertake political action. Granting voting rights in the elections to the European Parliament to Union citizens who reside in another <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> tackles not only a theoretical problem but also a very practical one, as the number of Union citizens who have benefited from the freedom of movement and establishment provided for by the EEC Treaty are estimated at five million.

40|$|Extradition {{agreements}} between Member States and third States {{fall within the}} competence of Member States, but the ruling in Aleksei Petruhhin (Court of Justice, judgment of 6 September 2016, case C- 182 / 15 [GC]) shows that Member States must exercise this competence in light of EU law if extradition may affect an EU citizen’s fundamental rights protected under the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This can be the case if the EU citizen who is subject to extradition has exercised his right to free movement by moving from his home State to another Member State. Extradition of Petruhhin, an Estonian citizen, was requested by Russia while he was exercising his right to freedom of movement and residence in Latvia. As {{is the case in}} many States, the national law of Latvia does not extend the same level of protection against extradition to foreign citizens, as to its own nationals. The Court of Justice ruled that in such a case, extradition of an EU citizen to a third State is generally prohibited under Art. 18 TFEU and can only be justified if the prosecution in the <b>home</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> is not possible. In addition, this case confirms earlier rulings that the extradition of an EU citizen will not be permitted if his fundamental rights under the Charter will be endangered in the requesting State. The case concerns prohibitions of absolute character, such as prohibition against torture and degrading treatment.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the regulatory}} framework which applies to the determination of directors’ remuneration in Europe and examines {{the extent to which}} European firms follow best practices in corporate governance in this area, drawing on an empirical analysis of the governance systems that European firms adopt in setting remuneration and, in particular, on an empirical assessment of their diverging approaches to disclosure. These divergences persist despite recent reforms. After an examination of the link between optimal remuneration, corporate governance and regulation and an assessment of how regulatory reform has evolved in this area, the paper provides an overview of national laws and best practice corporate governance recommendations across the Member States, following the adoption of the important EC Recommendations on directors’ remuneration and on the role of non-executive directors in 2004 and 2005, respectively. This overview is largely based on the answers to questionnaires sent to legal experts from seventeen European Member States. The paper also provides an empirical analysis of governance practices and, in particular, firm disclosure of directors’ remuneration in Europe’s largest 300 listed firms by market capitalisation. The paper reveals that, notwithstanding a swathe of reforms across the Member States in recent years and related harmonisation efforts, disclosure levels still vary from country to country and are strongly dependent on the existence of regulations and best practice guidelines in the firm’s <b>home</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> Convergence in disclosure practices is not strong; only a few basic standards are followed by the majority of the firms examined and there is strong divergence with respect to most of the criteria considered in the study. Consistent with previous research, our study reveals clear differences not only with respect to remuneration disclosure, but also with respect to shareholder engagement and the board’s role in the remuneration process and in setting remuneration guidelines. Ownership structures still ‘matter’; these divergences tend to follow different corporate governance systems and, in particular, the dispersed ownership/block-holding ownership divide. They do not appear to have been smoothed since the EC Company Law Action Plan was launched and notwithstanding the harmonisation that has been attempted in this field.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{the legislation that}} regulates the Romanian unit-linked life insurance market. The main document that regulates both the insurance business on Romanian market and the organizing and operating of the Insurance Supervisory Commission (CSA) is Law no. 32 / 2000 on insurance undertakings and insurance supervision, as amended and supplemented, which provides: organizing and operating of insurance, insurance/reinsurance and reinsurance undertakings, of mutual undertakings, {{as well as of}} insurance intermediaries; organizing and operating of the CSA; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance undertakings conducting business in or from Romania; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries, as well as the supervision of other activities related to the insurance mediation. The legislation which regulates the Romanian insurance market includes: norms issued by CSA; laws and governmental ordinances that regulate the Romanian financial market; CSA draft regulations which are to be submitted to consulting with the players on the market; EU Directives in the insurance field; repealed or no longer in force legislative acts and international sanctions. According to Directive, 2002 / 83 /EC, unit-linked life insurance products were defined as insurance contracts where the benefits provided are directly linked to the value of units in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) or to the value of assets contained in an internal fund owned by the insurance undertaking, usually divided into units, or a share index or some other reference value. The financial supervision shall include verification, with respect to the insurance undertaking's entire business, of its state of solvency, the establishment of technical provisions, including mathematical provisions, and of the assets covering them, in accordance with the rules laid down or practices followed in the <b>home</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> pursuant to the provisions adopted at Community level. Each Member State shall require of every insurance undertaking whose head office is situated in its territory an adequate available solvency margin in respect of its entire business. In general the European Union requirements and the national requirements are common for all life insurance products offered by an insurance company and also there is not a very clear distinction between the legislation regarding unit-linked life insurance products and the one regarding traditional life insurance products. Policyholders want to enjoy the benefits of equity investment in conjunction with mortality protection, and insurers have developed unit-linked contracts to meet this challenge. Unit linked insurance products are life insurance policies with investment component. Although some unit-linked contract types pass most of the asset risk to the policyholder and involve little or no investment risk for the insurer, it was natural for insurers to incorporate payment guarantees in these new contracts...|$|E
40|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis made clear the shortcomings in the European structure of financial supervision. In the cur­rent system of financial supervision the financial supervi­sor of the <b>home</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> is in principle the only autho­rity entitled to supervise financial institutions even {{in case the}} institution operates across borders. If the home financial supervisor does not effectively supervise the financial insti­tution, this failure could affect clients and creditors in other Member States. The bankruptcy of Icelandic banks was felt by accountholders in the United Kingdom and the Nether­lands. The shortcomings in the Icelandic Deposit Guaran­tee scheme 1 threatened to expose these depositors to losses on their savings {{that should have been}} covered by that sche­me. In the end, the UK and the Dutch government guaran­teed these deposits under the applicable deposit-guarantee scheme. However, the problems arising in the execution of the agreement concluded between the UK, Dutch and Icel­andic government to recover the UK and Dutch taxpayers’ money from Iceland show the enormous consequences of failure in local supervision. Despite their significant relevan­ce in the current crisis, in this article I will not address these problems in micro-prudential supervision of banks. This ar­ticle focuses on the mechanism to ensure consistent applica­tion by the different national supervisors of the harmonised set of conduct of business rules, in particular, the rules laid down in the Prospectus Directive 20032 and the Transparen­cy Directive 2004. 3 In order to solve the shortcomings in the European struc­ture of financial supervision, the European Commission pro­posed to create a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS) consisting of national supervisors and three new su­pranational European Supervisory Authorities. A Superviso­ry Authority for the banking sector 4, one for the insurance and pensions sector 5 and a supranational European Supervi­sory Authority to ensure compliance by financial institutions with conduct of business rules and the orderly functioning of the securities market. 6 The national financial supervisors remain the principal supervisory authorities. However, the supranational authorities will get decisive authority in case of emergency or continued non-agreement between national supervisors. In these cases the supranational authorities will have the authority to address directly financial institutions that do not comply with the European financial services and financial supervision legislation. In this article I will analyse in paragraph 2 the current struc­ture of financial supervision. In paragraph 3 I will discuss the de Larosière-report on the {{financial crisis}} and the present shortcomings in European financial supervision will be dealt with. Paragraph 4 provides a brief overview of the reaction of the European Commission to this report. In paragraph 5 I will describe the proposals of the European Commission. Paragraph 6 discusses the proposed future powers of the Eu­ropean Securities and Markets Authority to ensure compli­ance with the European rules on the prospectus and financi­al reporting.

40|$|In {{a series}} of {{landmark}} rulings on patient mobility and cross-border healthcare, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has made clear that Member States’ healthcare systems have {{to comply with the}} rules of the EU’s Internal Market when it comes to individual patient rights and the non-discrimination of healthcare providers. The rulings increased the possibilities for EU Member State citizens to get medical treatment in another Member State (“cross-border healthcare”), yet providing that under certain conditions the <b>home</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> has to pay for these treatments in the other country. After a decade of negotiations, these rulings have been codified in a European Directive. Assuming that European integration has an impact on national welfare states and taking the example of European rules on access to cross-border healthcare, this thesis suggests analyzes the domestic impact of European integration in terms of Europeanization of the Austrian healthcare system {{within the context of the}} interplay between actors’ interests and practices on the one hand, and institutional effects on the other. European cross-border healthcare in forms of regional projects and privately or publicly organized healthcare arrangements has already become a reality in many European countries, especially in border regions. The main research questions which guides this thesis can be be put as follows: How does European integration in healthcare impact on the interests, practices and strategies of national actors that operate between national institutional constraints and European opportunities? And if national actors’ interests and strategies change, does this in turn have repercussions on the national institutional rules of healthcare governance? Given that European integration in healthcare delivery is a rather a “recent” phenomenon, and based on the assumption that actors’ strategies change more easily than national institutions, the following hypothesis is tested: Even if national healthcare actors use Europe – and hence their practices and strategies change – their interests remain largely determined by the national institutional set-up of the healthcare system. The institutional boundaries of the national healthcare system may have become porous, but for the time being they remain intact. The main findings of this study confirm the hypothesis and can be summarized as follows: Austrian actors responsible for the delivery of healthcare actively integrate various usages Europe into their existing practices of healthcare governance. These usages of Europe are more frequent at European level than at national level. Those actors who have important legal competencies, financial resources, and hence power in healthcare governance at national level, are also in a better position to use Europe effectively than those actors who lack such national resources. Limited usages of Europe at national level by corporate actors can best be accounted for by practices of consensually governing a typically Bismarckian healthcare system. None of the actors analysed, no matter how critical their stance vis-à-vis their own healthcare system might be, puts into question the legitimacy of the national healthcare system in the light of increased European competencies in regulating cross-border healthcare. Advancing European integration, mainly through the ECJ’s rulings on cross-border healthcare, might have rendered national institutional boundaries porous, but national institutions retain – at least for the time being – their power of channelling actors’ interests and of influencing corresponding practices of healthcare governance. These results invite us to further investigate which kind of healthcare governance structures are being developed at European level in parallel to those existing at national level, and to what extent Bismarckian welfare regimes might be showing resistance to institutional change induced by European integration.

40|$|ES piliečių ekstradiciją tarp valstybių narių reguliuoja Europos arešto orderis, o konkrečių ES teisės normų, kurios reguliuotų ES piliečių ekstradiciją į trečiąsias šalis, nėra. Dvišalės valstybių sutartys paprastai reguliuoja tik pasirašiusiųjų valstybių piliečių ekstradicijos procesą, tad ES piliečių ekstradicija į trečiąsias šalis šiuo metu yra „pilkojoje zonoje“. Jei apsauga nuo ekstradicijos taikoma tik šalies piliečiams, atsiranda skirtingas požiūris, palyginti su kitų ES valstybių narių piliečiais, o tai galimai pažeidžia SESV 18 str. įtvirtintą nediskriminacijos principą, kuris draudžia bet kokią diskriminaciją dėl pilietybės, bei SESV 21 str. principą dėl laisvo žmonių judėjimo, kuriuo remiantis kiekvienas ES pilietis turi teisę laisvai judėti ir apsigyventi valstybių narių teritorijoje. Siekiant išsiaiškinti, ar ES valstybių narių ekstradicijos praktika atitinka ES teisės principus, darbe išanalizuota Europos Sąjungos Teisingumo Teismo praktika ir išsiaiškinta, jog ES piliečių teisių apribojimas gali būti pateisinamas objektyviomis priežastimis, tik jeigu jos yra būtinos interesų, kuriuos jomis siekiama užtikrinti, apsaugai ir tik tiek, kiek šių tikslų negalima pasiekti mažiau ribojančiomis priemonėmis. ES valstybėms narėms siūloma tokioje situacijoje teikti pirmenybę keitimuisi informacija su ES valstybe nare, kurios pilietis yra asmuo dėl kurio pateiktas trečiosios šalies ekstradicijos prašymas, ir suteikti gimtosios ES valstybės narės valdžios institucijoms galimybę išduoti Europos arešto orderį, jeigu pagal nacionalinę teisę jos gali vykdyti šio asmens baudžiamąjį persekiojimą už nusikaltimus, padarytus už šios valstybės teritorijos ribų. Tokiu atveju, kai teikiama pirmenybė galimam kaltinamojo asmens gimtosios ES valstybės narės Europos arešto orderiui, palyginti su trečiosios šalies ekstradicijos prašymu, priimančioji ES valstybė narė veiktų mažiau ribodama naudojimąsi teise laisvai judėti ir kartu kiek įmanydama pašalintų riziką, kad asmuo liks nenubaustas už nusikaltimą, už kurį yra persekiojamas. Tačiau pažymėtina, kad kreipimasis į ES piliečio kilmės valstybę narę ir siūlymas pasinaudoti Europos arešto orderiu tėra ES valstybėms narėms pasiūlyta „galimybė“, o ne pareiga. Todėl darytina išvada, jog ES piliečių ekstradicija į trečiąsias šalis nepažeidžia nediskriminacijos ir laisvo žmonių judėjimo principų. Extradition between EU {{members is}} governed by European Arrest Warrant, while rules on extradition, in a {{situation}} in which EU has not concluded an agreement on extradition with a third State, falls within the competence of the Member States. In most cases Member States have a nationality exception in their extradition agreements with third States and protect their citizens against foreign punitive systems. But these protective provisions do not include EU citizens of other Member States, therefore it creates situation in which principles of non-discrimination and freedom of movement might be violated. This work analyzes EU citizens extradition regulation and Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) practice in relevant cases in order to find out whether Article 18 TFEU and Article 21 TFEU should be interpreted as meaning that, in the event of extradition of a citizen of any Member State of the European Union to a non-Member State under an extradition agreement concluded between a Member State and a third country, the same level of protection must be guaranteed as is guaranteed to a citizen of the Member States in question? Three cases have reached CJEU for preliminary rulings and two of them are analyzed in this work in detail, in particular CJEU judgment on 6 September 2016 in Petruhhin case. The questions discussed in Petruhhin case concern the balance between the objectives of extradition agreements (the need to combat impunity), on the one hand, and the need {{to protect the rights of}} the person to be extradited (the EU citizen) under the Treaties. In that case Advocate General Bot delivered an opinion that nationality exception certainly constitutes a difference in treatment prohibited under Art. 18 TFEU. However, it also stated that the risk of impunity is a legitimate objective in EU law, which has to be attained by Member States according to the principle of necessity and proportionality, and thus by “less restrictive measures”. Principle aut dedere aut judicare provides a guidance to identify less restrictive measures, in so far as it allows to extend the protection against extradition to other EU citizens provided that at least one Member State has the jurisdiction to prosecute the offender. Finally, CJEU ruled that when a Member State to which a Union citizen, a national of another Member State, has moved receives an extradition request from a third State with which the first Member State has concluded an extradition agreement, it must inform the Member State of which the citizen in question is a national and, should that Member State so request, surrender that citizen to it, in accordance with the provisions of European Arrest Warrant, provided that that Member State has jurisdiction, pursuant to its national law, to prosecute that person for offences committed outside its national territory. However, it is uncertain how such an approach will function in practice, as further questions arise. For example, whether the State of nationality will actually perform the criminal proceedings in a satisfactory way? Difficulties may arise due to a possible lack of evidence, especially if there is no cooperation with the third State in question on that matter. Furthermore, it is not possible to bind the State of nationality to any specific conclusion of the criminal proceedings in a particular case, and the case may be closed for various reasons before it comes before the court of that State. Even though CJEU has refrained from expressly qualifying the relationship between the principle of non-discrimination and the nationality exception of the extradition agreement as a conflicting one, it confirmed that EU law may still apply to issues falling within the competence of the Member State, such as a bilateral extradition agreement between a Member State and a third State. Furthermore, the CJEU accepts that the host Member State may not need to extend its national provisions protecting its own citizens from extradition to another Member State, if this is necessary to promote the legitimate objective of prevention of impunity. However, host Member State should seek less restrictive ways to achieve this objective and highlights how impunity in such cases may be combated by making use of cooperation mechanisms available in EU, such as the European Arrest Warrant, which enables extradition to the <b>home</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> and thereby avoids unduly compromising citizens’ right to free movement within the EU. Since CJEU did not state that the Member State of nationality is obliged to issue a European Arrest Warrant when it has jurisdiction to prosecute, but merely that it must be given the „opportunity“ to do so, the conclusion of this work is that Member States who extradite EU citizens to third states do not violate principles of non-discrimination and freedom of movement...|$|E

40|$|From the introduction]. My {{study will}} focus in {{particular}} on three claims {{made in the}} literature about <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. The first claim is that <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation was initially low and {{that much of the}} Court's constitutionalization of the Treaty occurred when <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were simply too inattentive to notice the magnitude of the Court's activity. The second claim is that early <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation reflected a concern to protect national laws, but that this pattern of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation is changing as <b>member</b> <b>state</b> evince more of a desire to influence the general trend of Commmunity law. The final claim tested is that, with the Single European Act's change to qualified majority voting in the Council, member states' attitudes of acceptance toward the Court will change, and criticism of the Court will increase. This hypothesis is {{based on the belief that}} the supranationalism of the ECJ was accepted because of the intergovernmentalism of the Council. The data on <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation suggests, however, that none of these claims provide an accurate picture of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. While there has been an increase in participation over time, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have shown a high degree of participation in Article 177 cases from the outset. Further, trends in <b>member</b> <b>states</b> participation do not provide adequate empirical proof of a change in <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation from self-interest to a Community interest. Finally, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> do not appear to have changed their behavior toward the Court since the passage of the Single European Act...|$|R
