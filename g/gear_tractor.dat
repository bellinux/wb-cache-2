The tractors were tested with 7 load levels per speed at four different travel speeds {{as close as possible}} to 4, 7. 5, 10, and 13 km·h- 1. The IVT tractors were operated in Auto mode and the <b>geared</b> <b>tractors</b> were shifted up three gears and throttled back to the same travel speeds as the IVT tractors. The 7 loads were selected at 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75, and 80 % of drawbar pull at maximum power at the selected speed. Model 1 (fuel consumption as a liner function of drawbar power), currently used in OECD Code 2, Section 4. 4. 8 (OECD, 2014), resulted in a unique equation for each speed. When the slopes for each tractor were compared, 79 % of the comparisons were not significantly different. For 80 % of the tractors, the second variable in Models 2 and 3 were determined to be significant. For 80 % of the tractors, Model 2 was determined to be more accurate than Model 3.. While Model 1 was found to be more accurate than Model 2, the requirement of having a separate equation for each speed limits the practical application of Model 1. Model 2 had only slightly larger error than Model 1, but has the additional flexibility of being applicable over a range of speeds. Advisor: Michael Koche...|$|R

The tractors were tested with seven load levels per speed at three different travel speeds {{as close as possible}} to 7. 5, 10, and 13 km h- 1. The IVT tractors were operated in auto mode, and the <b>geared</b> <b>tractors</b> were shifted up three gears and throttled back to the same travel speeds as obtained with the original gear (before shifting up) at maximum drawbar power. The seven loads were selected at 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 75 %, and 80 % of the drawbar pull at maximum power and rated engine speed at the selected travel speed. Model 1 (fuel consumption as a linear function of drawbar power on concrete), currently used in OECD Code 2, Section 4. 4. 8, resulted in a separate equation for each speed tested. When regression mean square errors were used for statistical comparison of the five fuel consumption models, model 5 (fuel consumption as a linear function of drawbar power and travel speed on concrete, and engine speed) was not significantly different from the model currently used in OECD Code 2, Section 4. 4. 8 (model 1, fuel consumption as a linear function of drawbar power on concrete, with separate equations specific to the three speeds tested). The simplest model (model 2), which used a single equation for fuel consumption as a linear function of drawbar power on concrete over the range of speeds tested, had significantly higher regression mean square errors compared to model 1 for half of the eight tractors tested. Model 5 (fuel consumption as a linear function of drawbar power and travel speed on concrete, and engine speed) was determined to be the best of the five models for estimating fuel consumption, with a single equation applicable over the range of speeds tested.

The study was conducted at New Halfa Sugar Factory, with a cane crushing rate of 5000 tons/day. A 150 hp tractor was used on 1 km hauling route as the most critical grade from the second main center up to the unloading platform. The route was divided into four sections with different grades. The grade of each section was measured with surveying equipment. The road combined resistance, that has to be overcome by the hauling unit, is the sum of the route grade and the coefficient of rolling resistance. As per literature, the coefficient of rolling resistance is assumed to be 0. 02 for all sections. The tractor was run on different gear meshes to determine its grade ability at different speeds. The total operation time, function of gear mesh and road combined resistance were determined and used to calculate hauling unit production rate. The factory crushing rate was divided by the hauling unit production rate to get the number of hauling units.

Tillage operations were carried out using each blade with the same prime mover tractor and rotavator platforms in two different soil and Power Take-Off (PTO) speed conditions. During the operations, PTO speed and torque, soil pulverizing ratio and inversion ratio, actual work speed, and rotavating width and depth were measured, and the required power of the PTO shaft, field capacity and flow of tilled soil were calculated to compare the characteristics according to the tillage blade shape. Experimental results show that the rotavating width, actual work speed, field capacity, flow of tilled soil and soil inversion ratio were independent of the blade shape, whereas the rotavating depth and soil pulverizing ratio were influenced by the blade shape according to the soil condition.

40|$|Nowadays {{the work}} is in {{progress}} to develop wheeled and caterpillar tractors with electromechanical transmission. Range of changes in transmission gear ratio while using propulsion electric motor depends on mechanical characteristics of a tractor propulsion electric motor which is equipped with electromechanical transmission. In case when the range is rather high then {{it is possible to}} minimize number of gearings in the <b>tractor</b> <b>gearing</b> box or exclude its usage at all. Type of the applied propulsion electric motor and regulation method specify type of mechanical characteristics (characteristics family) of the propulsion electric motor. The paper considers a propulsion asynchronous electric motor with frequency control. While using frequency control it is possible to regulate electric motor revolutions by mutual changes in voltage and voltage frequency. There are various laws of mutual changes in voltage and frequency (regulation laws). Selection of a regulation law influences on type of mechanical characteristics of a propulsion electric motor. Application of any law can be admissible only for some specific range of voltage frequency otherwise it is possible to exceed some parameters (for example, admissible voltage in the winding of electric motor stator). It is necessary to ensure the required moment within wide range for a tractor propulsion electric motor. In this case losses in the electric motor must be minimal. Losses in the rotor of the propulsion asynchronous electric motor are directly proportional to its sliding and its best propulsion and mechanical properties of a mobile machine will be ensured in the case when sliding is preserved at a constant value. According to these reasons selection of regulation laws has been carried out for operation of the propulsion asynchronous electric motor with nominal sliding and mechanical characteristics at nominal sliding is conventionally called a nominal characteristics. The paper analyzes the possible laws of mutual application of voltage and voltage frequency and their application boundaries. A combination of laws for regulation of the propulsion asynchronous electric motor has been selected in the paper. The combination ensures the widest operational range of the electric motor with high moment value at nominal sliding and due account of limitations on application of every used regulation law. The following mechanical characteristics family has been constructed for the propulsion asynchronous electric motor regulated in accordance with the proposed law: at nominal sliding, at critical sliding, at changeable sliding and without changes in voltage and frequency. </p...|$|R

Attachments that are available are moldboard and disc plows, spiked tooth harrows, trailed-type (non-powered) rotary puddlers (lateral drums with protruding paddles), various types of levelers and simple trailers (usually without brakes or lights).
