5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} how they worked {{hard to make the}} {{animation}} believable, saying: [...] "It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator {{to be able to put}} some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun for us because we got to go back to our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] said Jonas, [...] "the air {{gets down}} into the water, and you wonder how it can, when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> lighter than water. So water gets up into the air, and I wonder how it can, when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> heavier. <b>So</b> that the {{difficulty}} {{is just about the}} same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, I like this," [...] Helen said softly. [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{better than}} a dinner party, or going out anywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do, Trichy, I do; don't scold me now. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{easier to}} preach than to practise. I do <b>so</b> wish I <b>was</b> a clergyman." ...|$|R
2500|$|At the time, Oliver {{was also}} an {{acclaimed}} artist with his work being displayed in exhibitions depicting Rhondda life. There are slight variations with the cover in different territories with some showing {{the shadow of the}} figure with wings - either angels wings or more likely bird wings. This is best depicted in an official promotional colour wallpaper the band released for fans. Whilst it has never been clarified, the city in the background is believed to depict Los Angeles in the United States where the album was recorded and mixed. Ian Watkins said that he regarded artwork as [...] "just as important as the music", and in January 2010 reflected back on some of the Lostprophets' artwork saying [...] "I remember doing the ‘Start Something’ record and compiling the inlay which is a collage of two years of our lives. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> I’d sit there for hours looking at the booklet and all the little pictures. I did that to all the albums I bought." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 7, 2011, both [...] "Party" [...] and [...] "Countdown" [...] leaked online, {{followed}} by the whole album, three weeks prior to its official release date on June 28, 2011. This was {{followed by}} cease-and-desist notices from Beyoncé's legal team, who forced multiple media sites to remove download links to the songs. Beginning on June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Knowles' official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and a quote. On June 24, 2011, [...] "Countdown" [...] was the ninth song to be chosen. The quote found Beyoncé elaborating on the song's inspiration: [...] "I really liked mixing the 90s with the 70s. I put those two together and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> putting bridges back into songs, all the things in music that I love that I feel I just want to hear again." [...] She also referred to [...] "Countdown" [...] as [...] "really experimental". Concerning the development [...] "Countdown" [...] {{and the reason for}} using the sample, Beyoncé stated: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{full circle}} poetry of my having written 'Uninvited' for its remake, {{combined}} with {{my love of}} the original movie... my love of Germany, having lived there for three years as a child (by the Black Forest), combined most importantly with how this video is such a visual extension of the song 'Guardian,' which {{is so close to}} my heart… <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> to make it in Berlin!." ...|$|E
6000|$|The natives, I should explain, named this {{particular}} gun [...] "Intombi", {{which means a}} young girl, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> slimmer and more graceful than other guns.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{easier for}} you to explain than for a {{stranger}} like myself," [...] said Barton, and strolled westward by way of Co vent Garden.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear one, {{neither will}} <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{pleasure}} to me [...] . But I do {{take a little}} delight in my life, I suppose," [...] she pouted.|$|R
5000|$|... "It was very, very hot," [...] Hess recalls. [...] "But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> {{being in}} this rural farm town making a movie. We shot it in 23 days, so we were moving very, very fast; I just didn't {{have a lot of}} film {{to be able to do}} a lot of takes. It was a bunch of friends getting {{together}} to make a movie. It was like, [...] "Are people going to get this? Is it working?" ...|$|E

5000|$|The band's first {{performance}} {{together was}} in February 2008 at a Hagar concert in The Pearl Concert Theatre @ The Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. The show included a three song set which included Led Zeppelin's [...] "Rock and Roll", Traffic's [...] "Dear Mr. Fantasy" [...] and [...] "Going Down", a song often performed by Hagar and Anthony in their other band, Los Tres Gusanos. Regarding the show, bassist Michael Anthony states: [...] "At that point, {{we knew the}} chemistry was there. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun,</b> and the instant gratification from the audience was great. We {{decided to take the}} next step and see what we could do. It was just too much fun to pass up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At least <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{the worse}} for the poor old earth, if her doom is to stand still, while man {{improves}} and progresses from age to age." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head {{with a kind of}} joyous sadness for the past. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better to <b>be</b> totally ignorant of love, and then to learn it--like this! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to {{say that}} one will love a man better than all the world, and go to him, and belong to him, and be his wife." ...|$|R
5000|$|Burton {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of the crowd; earning him $230,370. He was happy with the result: [...] "That was a heck of a race. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> racing Matt. I am so appreciative for everyone on this car who stuck with us through times that were tough.", and, [...] "It has been a long time. felt like if we just kept putting ourselves in position then we'd have a good chance. We've been doing that this year." [...] Second-place finisher Edwards congratulated Burton on his victory and said the race was [...] "fun": [...] "We had an awesome Ford Fusion. That's the best car I've ever had here and that was a lot more fun than in the past." ...|$|E
5000|$|The race led to {{fears that}} Formula One bosses Max Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone, {{who had been}} highly {{critical}} of the media and corporate facilities of Silverstone, would use the incident to drop the race from the Formula One calendar, with Ecclestone saying [...] "It wasn't necessary - the race was exciting enough without it. But the security wasn't good enough". However, drivers and team officials defended the circuit, with Montoya stating [...] "This {{was one of the best}} races of the year, even with the spectator. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> today," [...] and Sauber boss Peter Sauber stated [...] "When a man sets himself on fire in the street in Paris, no one blames Paris", while McLaren-Mercedes boss Ron Dennis said [...] "There is no way you can prevent it happening".|$|E
5000|$|Government Issue reunited {{a second}} time for a {{performance}} in Washington, D.C. on December 11, 2010. The show featured the band's final lineup of Stabb, Lyle, Robbins, and Moffett, and was a benefit to raise medical funds for a local DJ. On April 11, 2014, Government Issue reunited for the final time with the original Legless Bull lineup of Stabb, John Barry, Brian Gay along with drummer Karl Hill for the Damaged City Festival in Washington, DC. After the final reunion show, Stabb said [...] "Government Issue is a group again, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> playing Damaged City Fest 2014, we decided to just keep it going." [...] The band continued in 2015, playing the Bad Ass Weekend festival in Houston that February and a five-date tour of the Southeastern United States in October and November, including a performance at The Fest. Stabb died of stomach cancer on May 7, 2016 {{at the age of}} 54.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very kind, Mr. Lancaster," [...] said Olive, {{breaking}} the silence, [...] "for {{you to come}} to see us instead of writing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> pleasanter for friends--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More serious, certainly," [...] {{returned}} Colonel Geraldine; [...] "and as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more <b>so,</b> {{will you}} allow me five minutes' speech in private {{with my friend}} Mr. Godall?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{my nature}} to be earnest. A girl comes {{out into the}} world so young that she becomes serious, and steady as <b>it</b> <b>were,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> sooner than a man does." ...|$|R

5000|$|David Bianculli at the Daily News {{thought that}} [...] "In a Mirror, Darkly" [...] {{was the best}} episode of Enterprise so far and enjoyed that the actors could play against type for their characters. He gave the episode a score of {{three and a half}} out of four and said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> that [...] "had they adopted this {{attitude}} from the start, [...] "Enterprise" [...] probably would still be flying missions next season." [...] When reviewing the first part for TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green said that her favorite part was the modified opening sequence, and described it as [...] "fun and lighthearted in a twisted sort of way" [...] but thought that the closing episodes of the series would have been better if they had concentrated on the real crew and ship. She thought that the second installment saw the series [...] "stretching a clever idea too thin", and that a [...] "one-hour 'Mirror' would have made more sense in terms of the pacing and for Enterprise as a whole." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{getting harder}} and harder to enunciate my {{proposition}} to make a sojourn at the inn. I wished that I had spoken sooner. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> easier to do things promptly.|$|R
6000|$|... "And do you {{not hear}} me tell you <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the better! and did I not tell you this morning, when you thought {{yourself}} so happy, what an evening was coming upon you?" ...|$|R
60|$|I am by {{no means}} sure that if the good people of Milby had known {{the truth about the}} Countess Czerlaski, they would not have been {{considerably}} disappointed to find that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very far from being as bad as they imagined. Nice distinctions <b>are</b> troublesome. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> easier to say that a thing is black, than to discriminate the particular shade of brown, blue, or green, to which it really belongs. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> easier to make up your mind that your neighbour is good for nothing, than to enter into all the circumstances that would oblige you to modify that opinion.|$|R

5000|$|... "7 Things" [...] is {{also under}} the legal title of [...] "Seven Things I Hate About You", as {{registered}} by Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI).

[...] "I was locked up in the bus the entire time. And it was, like, such a great {{time for me to}} have a minute for myself, which I never get.

I didn't even mean for it to be for, you know, the record or for anything. It was just like 'just start writing this'. I got into it and I played some of it for my sister and she was like, 'dude, that's awesome'.
