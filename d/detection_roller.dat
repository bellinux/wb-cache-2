30|$|Shape {{detection}} is {{the premise}} to realize shape closed-loop control {{and is the}} key to improve shape quality. The strip shape meter is the “eye” of online detection. It is a high-end measuring instrument of the rolling process. The strip shape meter consists of two main parts, namely, shape <b>detection</b> <b>roller</b> and shape signal transmission processor. The development of a shape meter is so difficult that it has been monopolized for a long time by Sweden’s ABB, Germany’s SIEMENS, SUNDWIG, and other international companies [83 – 87]. In the past 10 years, a major breakthrough on the shape meter has achieved in China. The seamless shape <b>detection</b> <b>roller</b> and wireless shape signal transmission processor have been independently developed and successfully applied in industry [88 – 91].|$|E

40|$|Abstract Early fault {{diagnosis}} of roller bearings {{is extremely important}} for rotating machines, especially for high speed, automatic and precise machines. Many research efforts have been focused on {{fault diagnosis}} and <b>detection</b> of <b>roller</b> bearings, since they constitute one the most important elements of rotating machinery. In this study a combination method is proposed for early damage <b>detection</b> of <b>roller</b> bearing. Wavelet packet transform (WPT) {{is applied to the}} collected data for denoising and the resulting clean data are break-down into some elementary components called Intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method. The normalized energy of three first IMFs are used as input for Support vector machine (SVM) to recognize whether signals are sorting out from healthy or faulty bearings. Then, since there is no robust guide to determine amplitude of added noise in EEMD technique, a new Performance improved EEMD (PIEEMD) is proposed to determine the appropriate value of added noise. A novel feature extraction method is also proposed for detecting small size defect using Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO). TKEO is applied to IMFs obtained to create new feature vectors as input data for one-class SVM. The results of applying the method to acceleration signals collected from an experimental bearing test rig demonstrated that the method can be successfully used for early damage <b>detection</b> of <b>roller</b> bearings. Most of the diagnostic methods that have been developed up to now can be applied for the case stationary working conditions only (constant speed and load). However, bearings often work at time-varying conditions such as wind turbine supporting bearings, mining excavator bearings, vehicles, robots and all processes with run-up and run-down transients. Damage identification for bearings working under non-stationary operating conditions, especially for early/small defects, requires the use of appropriate techniques, which are generally different from those used for the case of stationary conditions, in order to extract fault-sensitive features which are at the same time insensitive to operational condition variations. Some methods have been proposed for damage detection of bearings working under time-varying speed conditions. However, their application might increase the instrumentation cost because of providing a phase reference signal. Furthermore, some methods such as order tracking methods still can be applied when the speed variation is limited. In this study, a novel combined method based on cointegration is proposed for the development of fault features which are sensitive to the presence of defects while in the same time they are insensitive to changes in the operational conditions. It does not require any additional measurements and can identify defects even for considerable speed variations. The signals acquired during run-up condition are decomposed into IMFs using the performance improved EEMD method. Then, the cointegration method is applied to the intrinsic mode functions to extract stationary residuals. The feature vectors are created by applying the Teager-Kaiser energy operator to the obtained stationary residuals. Finally, the feature vectors of the healthy bearing signals are utilized to construct a separating hyperplane using one-class support vector machine. Eventually the proposed method was applied to vibration signals measured on an experimental bearing test rig. The results verified that the method can successfully distinguish between healthy and faulty bearings even if the shaft speed changes dramaticall...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a fault <b>detection</b> of <b>roller</b> bearings through signal processing and optimization techniques. After {{the occurrence of}} scratch-type defects on the inner race of bearings, variations of kurtosis values are investigated in terms of two different data processing techniques: minimum entropy deconvolution (MED), and the Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO). MED and the TKEO are employed to qualitatively enhance the discrimination of defect-induced repeating peaks on bearing vibration data with measurement noise. Given {{the perspective of the}} execution sequence of MED and the TKEO, the study found that the kurtosis sensitivity towards a defect on bearings could be highly improved. Also, the vibration signal from both healthy and damaged bearings is decomposed into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), through empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The weight vectors of IMFs become design variables for a genetic algorithm (GA). The weights of each IMF can be optimized through the genetic algorithm, to enhance the sensitivity of kurtosis on damaged bearing signals. Experimental results show that the EMD-GA approach successfully improved the resolution of detectability between a roller bearing with defect, and an intact system...|$|R

30|$|A certain pre-pressure {{is applied}} on the sensor by an {{interference}} fit manner to keep the sensor working in the linearity range [96]. In fact, a certain temperature difference and thermal deformation difference exist between the outer surface of the <b>detection</b> <b>roller</b> and the internal sensor in the rolling process, and these differences may weaken or reduce the magnitude of interference and pre-pressure between sensors and the inner wall of through-holes, resulting in detection signal distortion. Therefore, the assembly of sensors must have an adequate magnitude of interference and pre-pressure. To solve the problem, the temperature field, thermal deformation, and pressure transfer of the <b>detection</b> <b>roller</b> and sensors in the rolling process were simulated with the finite element software. The structure size of the roller and the magnitude of interference were optimized according to the simulation results [97, 98].|$|E
30|$|The working {{principle}} is that {{power is supplied}} to the wireless receiving board and the outer magnetic ring on the cover by the cable and voltage-stabilizing circuit board. The rotating inner magnetic ring receives the voltage-stabilizing signal by wireless induction transmission, and all sensors in the <b>detection</b> <b>roller</b> and all the circuit boards on the rotating head are powered by the excitation power board. The output signals of sensor are gathered by the analog acquisition board, and the digital processing board implements analog-to-digital conversion. Digital processing and coding are performed under the conditions of magnetic coupling isolation and photoelectric isolation. The signals are then delivered to the wireless transmission board. The wireless transmission board converts the signals into high-frequency wireless signals and transmits the wireless signals to the wireless receiving board. The wireless receiving board converts the wireless signals to wired signals. Finally, the signals are transmitted to the remote signal-processing computer via the shielded cable.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates fault <b>detection</b> of a <b>roller</b> {{bearing system}} using a wavelet {{denoising}} scheme and proper orthogonal value (POV) of an intrinsic mode function (IMF) covariance matrix. The IMF of the bearing vibration signal is obtained through empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The signal screening {{process in the}} wavelet domain eliminates noise-corrupted portions {{that may lead to}} inaccurate prognosis of bearing conditions. We segmented the denoised bearing signal into several intervals, and decomposed each of them into IMFs. The first IMF of each segment is collected to become a covariance matrix for calculating the POV. We show that covariance matrices from healthy and damaged bearings exhibit different POV profiles, which can be a damage-sensitive feature. We also illustrate the conventional approach of feature extraction, of observing the kurtosis value of the measured signal, to compare the functionality of the proposed technique. The study demonstrates the feasibility of wavelet-based de-noising, and shows through laboratory experiments that tracking the proper orthogonal values of the covariance matrix of the IMF can be an effective and reliable measure for monitoring bearing fault...|$|R
