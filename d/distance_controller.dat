40|$|Abstract — Sophisticated {{fuzzy rule}} systems are {{supposed}} to be flexible, complete, consistent and compact (FC 3). Flexibility, completeness and consistency are essential for fuzzy systems to exhibit an excellent performance and to have a clear physical meaning, while compactness is crucial when the number of the input variables increases. However, the completeness and consistency conditions are often violated if a fuzzy system is generated from data collected from real world applications. In an attempt to develop FC 3 fuzzy systems, a systematic design paradigm is proposed using evolution strategies. The structure of the fuzzy rules, which determines the compactness of the fuzzy systems, is evolved along with the parameters of the fuzzy systems. Special {{attention has been paid to}} the completeness and consistency of the rule base. The completeness is guaranteed by checking the completeness of the fuzzy partitioning of input variables and the completeness of the rule structure. An index of inconsistency is suggested with the help of a fuzzy similarity measure, which can prevent the algorithm from generating rules that seriously contradict with each other or with the heuristic knowledge. In addition, soft T-norm and BADD defuzzification are introduced and optimized to increase the flexibility of the fuzzy system. The proposed approach is applied to the design of <b>distance</b> <b>controller</b> for cars. It is verified that a FC 3 fuzzy system works very well both for training and test driving situations, especially when the training data are insufficient.

40|$|In {{the first}} {{writings}} of his Jena period, Hegel defends {{the conception of}} an original identity through which subjectivity is "suspended". The present article aims to expound this conception as {{a contribution to the}} theory of intentionality which focusses on the unity of conceptual and sensuous (or motivational) elements as a condition of the intentionality of perception and action. In a first step, it is argued that in his early writings, by "philosophy of subjectivity" Hegel understands positions which separate the conceptual and the sensuous elements of perception and action, conceiving {{at the same time the}} subject as a <b>distanced</b> <b>controller</b> of sensibility. Thus, the hegelian critique of the philosophy of subjectivity is directed against such a conception of intentionality and its subject. In a second step, the hegelian alternative to this picture is exposed - the conception of an indissoluble unity of thinking and sensibility as being fundamental to perception and action. Finally, the picture of self-consciousness which arises in the Phenomenology of Spirit is analyzed as an implication of the conception of intentionality adopted in the earlier writings. Nos primeiros escritos da sua fase ienense, Hegel defende a concepção de uma identidade originária na qual a subjetividade seria “suspendida”. O presente trabalho visa explicitar essa concepção como uma contribuição para a teoria da intencionalidade que coloca em foco a unidade entre elementos conceituais e sensíveis (ou emocional-motivacionais) como condição da intencionalidade da percepção e do agir. Num primeiro passo, argumenta-se que nos seus escritos críticos Hegel entende por “filosofia da subjetividade” posições que envolvem uma concepção separadora acerca da relação entre pensamento e sensibilidade na percepção e no agir, estando ligada à noção do sujeito como controlador distanciado da sensibilidade. Portanto, a crítica hegeliana à filosofia da subjetividade dirige-se contra tal concepção da intencionalidade e do sujeito desta. Num segundo passo, aborda-se a alternativa hegeliana a essa imagem - a concepção da unidade indissolúvel do pensamento e da sensilidade como fundamento da percepção e do agir. Por fim, a imagem da autoconsciência adotada na Fenomenologia do Espírito é analizada como implicação dessa concepção da intencionalidade. ...|$|R

The vibration absorber consists of mass block, cantilever beam, magnet lock system, vibration and <b>distance</b> sensors, <b>controller</b> and servo motor. The mass block is fixed on the tip of cantilever beam, and the control process is driven by a servo motor and a transmit gears. Portion of cantilever was cut in form of gear tracks, which can be driven by servo motor through transmit gear to regulate the length of the cantilever beam, and the natural frequency of absorber will also be regulated. After the mass locates in right position (i. e. the natural frequency of absorber is in assigned condition), the magnetic lock will clamp the cantilever beam.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Thesis (M. S.) : Bilkent University, Department of Mechanical Engineering, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2017. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 67 - 72). Atomic force microscopy is a widely-used instrument in nanotechnology and nanoscience. Imaging of single molecules, atoms or even bond structures and tip-sample interactions with pm and pN resolution are made possible with non-contact {{atomic force microscope}} (NC-AFM) techniques. Since very high resolution imaging is relatively recent and underlying effects are not yet fully understood, interpretation of images can be controversial and may differ. Therefore theoretical modeling is used alongside with experimental work {{in order to gain}} a better insight about underlying physical phenomena regarding NC-AFM images and related artifacts. In this thesis work, a simulator for NC-AFM experiments is suggested which utilizes the harmonic oscillator equations for AFM cantilever dynamics and molecular dynamics (MD) for the interaction between tip and sample. For this purpose, a model graphene surface with underlying platinum substrate and a platinum tip is created and their interaction is mapped at different distances with MD techniques. Calculated interaction forces are fitted to polynomials and imported to the harmonic oscillator model. With the harmonic oscillator model and imported interaction data, two different operating modes of NC-AFM are modeled: Constant Height and Topography Scan. When obtained force maps are investigated, tip asymmetry related artifacts are observed. Due to tip asymmetry, a shift in detected atom positions and overall spatial disturbance are observed. Furthermore, the mobility of atoms causes elongation of the tip and a bumpy formation of the sample surface near the tip. Elongation of the tip decreased the overall interaction due to increasing sharpness of the tip. Also an overall noise is detected due to individual, thermally-induced movements of atoms. Obtained NC-AFM scan results were able to map the surface as desired. In constant height mode, more attractive hollow-site regions of graphene are detected via high frequency shifts, as expected. Also due to increasing interaction, closer tip-surface distances resulted in higher frequency shifts. Increasing oscillation amplitudes caused a decrease in the ratio of short-range interactions over the whole oscillation cycle and hence decreased the frequency shift. In the topography scan mode, attractive hollow-site regions are tracked as expected; increasing the set frequency shift also increased the topography corrugation and decreased the mean tip-sample distance. Moreover, non-optimal (too slow or too fast) <b>distance</b> <b>controllers</b> resulted in tracking the surface in an unreliable way and controller-induced noise. With these results, a functional NC- AFM model is demonstrated which is able to satisfactorily simulate NC-AFM experiments. by Berkin Uluutku. M. S...|$|R

Many mission concepts involve the deployment and assembly of mission support assets prior to crew arrival on the surface. Some of these deployment and assembly activities {{will be performed}} autonomously while others will be performed using teleoperations. However, significant communications latencies between the Earth and Mars make teleoperations challenging. Alternatively, low latency teleoperations are possible from locations in Mars orbit like Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. To explore these latency opportunities, NASA is conducting {{a series of studies}} to investigate the effects of latency on telerobotic deployment and assembly activities. These studies are being conducted in laboratory environments at NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC), the Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) at JSC and the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) underwater habitat off the coast of Florida. The studies involve two human-in-the-loop interactive simulations developed by the NASA Exploration Systems Simulations (NExSyS) team at JSC. The first simulation investigates manipulation related activities while the second simulation investigates mobility related activities. The first simulation provides a simple real-time operator interface with displays and controls for a simulated 6 degree of freedom end effector. The initial version of the simulation uses a simple control mode to decouple the robotic kinematic constraints and a communications delay to model latency effects. This provides the basis for early testing with more detailed manipulation simulations planned for the future. Subjects are tested using five operating latencies that represent teleoperation conditions from local surface operations to orbital operations at Phobos, Deimos and ultimately high Martian orbit. Subject performance is measured and correlated with three distance-to-target zones of interest. Each zone represents a target distance ranging from beyond 10 m in Zone 1, through 1 cm to contact in Zone 5 with a step size factor of 10. Collected data consists of both objective simulation data (time, <b>distance,</b> hand <b>controller</b> inputs, velocity) and subjective questionnaire data. The second simulation provides a simple real-time operator interface with displays and control of a simulated surface rover. The rover traverses a synthetic Mars-like terrain and must be maneuvered to avoid obstacles while progressing to its destination. Like the manipulator simulation, subjects are tested using five operating latencies that represent teleoperation conditions from local surface operations to orbital operations at Phobos, Deimos and ultimately high Martian orbit. The rover is also operated at three different traverse speeds to assess the correlation between latency and speed. Collected data consisted of both objective simulation data (time, <b>distance,</b> hand <b>controller</b> inputs, braking) and subjective questionnaire data.

However, this study only focuses on driving control system that based on vision sensor. Therefore, this study presents a simulation system with Graphical User Interface (GUI) to simulate and analyse the driving control for autonomous vehicle that based on video taken from the vehicle during driving on highway, by using MATLAB programming. The GUI gives easy access to analyse video, image and vehicle dynamics. Once the GUI application for simulation is launched, user can enter input parameters value (number of frames, canny edge detection value, vehicle speed, and braking time) in text control to simulate and analyse video images and vehicle driving control. In this study, there are four subsystems in the system development process. The first subsystem is sensor. This study was used a single GrandVision Mini Digital Video as sensor. This video camera provides the information of Selangor's highway environment by recording highway scene in front of the vehicle during driving. Then, the recorded video is process in second subsystem or named as imageprocessing subsystem. In this subsystem, image-capturing techniques capture the video images frame by frame. After that, lane detection process extracts the information about vehicle position with respect to the highway lane. The results are angle between the road tangent and orientation of the vehicle at some look-ahead <b>distance.</b> Driving <b>controller</b> in the controller subsystem that is the third subsystem used the resulted angle from lane detection process along with vehicle dynamics parameters to determine the vehicle-driving angle and vehicle dynamics performance.

This nimbus of regularity" has {{to be put in}} question though because of continous police scandals and assaults. As an illustration of this problem the paper starts with a chapter in which (for the first time) the scandal of the police department Bernau is described in a detailed way. The dissertation systematically argues for an effective control of the police and asks, who exactly (with what measures and what prospect for success) is responsible for the control activity. First of all the measures (i. e. basic rights, certain aspects of the constitutional state) and criterions (i. e. the need of independant <b>controllers,</b> <b>distance</b> between actors) are worked out. After that the concrete practice of control is acquired, whereas the conditions in the state Brandenburg are analyzed as an example. The control by the state parliament, justice, executive, alternative controllers, several citizens and media is also illuminated by numerous examples. Afterwards the control situation is valuated by means of those measures and criterions that I've already worked out. The results are more than sobering, because in the main fields of police activity an effective control does not take place. Moreover the effort of control appears often only symbolically, as a show. There are also mentioned alternative possibilities of control and the question of the transferability of the results to other police departments in different states. Section 2 / 1 / 1 describes as an excursion the discussion about identification tags for police officers...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} and survivability of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV's) {{in field}} applications {{have been demonstrated}} during many of the recent conflicts. UAV's {{have the potential to}} reduce costs and personnel while performing certain missions such as surveillance and reconnaissance with higher efficiency and lower risks. Since it is now recognized that a single UAV cannot achieve all tasks required during a mission, the option of using fleets of UAV's with complementary capabilities is now explored. However, controlling and coordinating such fleets will be almost impossible when considering the overwhelming number of degrees of freedom and their associated constraints, if individual UAV do not possess a high level of autonomy. Addressing the need for intelligent controllers, this work presents a new approach for on-line trajectory planning of a single UAV. The approach uses a genetic algorithm and integrates constraints of different types including specific times of arrival, vectors of approach close to target points, multiple objectives, weather conditions and behavioural guidelines with respect to speed, altitude and obstacle <b>distance.</b> The UAV's <b>controller</b> is divided into three modules. The first one is a trajectory generator that uses an analytical model to simulate the dynamics of UAV's. It is used to compute new trajectories in 3 D as well as to assess the feasibility of existing ones. The second module is a knowledge base that uses a hybrid octree structure to represent terrain in 3 D. The octree compresses digital elevation data by setting the resolution of the UAV's internal map to different levels based on the homogeneity of the terrain. The third module is a Genetic Algorithm that finds and optimizes candidate trajectories which fulfill all objectives of a mission while taking in account a variable number of constraints with varying preponderance. Simulations have shown that the intelligent controller could find viable trajectories within 10 to 20 seconds for missions with a single objective, demonstrating the feasibility of using this control scheme for real-time path planning for UAV's. Dynamically feasible trajectories satisfying all constraints could also be found for missions with up to three objectives. However, real time capabilities were severely reduced for such complex missions, the average computing time varying from 200 to 450 seconds. In all cases, all resulting trajectories were dynamically feasible, and could be readily used by the autopilot...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} designing a control system for a modern bicycle so that the bicycle is stable and follows a path. We propose a multi-loop control architecture, where each loop is systematically designed using linear control techniques. The proposed strategy guarantees that the bicycle asymptotically converges to paths of constant curvature. A key advantage of our approach is that by using linear techniques analysis and controller design are relatively simple. We base our control design on the nonlinear (corrected) Whipple model, which has been previously verified for correctness and experimentally validated. The equations of motion for the nonlinear model are very complicated, and would take many pages to explicitly state. They also have no known closed form solution. To enable analysis of the model we linearize it about a trajectory such that the bicycle is upright and travelling straight ahead. This linearization allows us {{to arrive at a}} parameterized linear time-invariant state-space representation of the bicycle dynamics, suitable for analysis and control design. The inner-loop control consists of a forward-speed controller as well as a lean and steer controller. To keep the bicycle at a constant forward speed, we develop a high-bandwidth proportional controller that uses a torque along the axis of the rear wheel of the bicycle to keep the angular velocity of the rear wheel at a constant setpoint. To stabilize the bicycle at this forward speed, lean torque and steer torque are treated as the control signals. We design a state-feedback controller and augment integrators to the output feedback of the lean angle and steer angle to provide perfect steady-state tracking. To arrive at the gains for state feedback, linear-quadratic regulator methods are used. When following a constant-curvature path, a vehicle has a constant yaw rate. Using this knowledge, we begin designing the outer-loop path-following control by finding a map that converts a yaw rate into appropriate lean angle and steer angle references for the inner loop. After the map is completed, system identification is performed by applying a yaw-rate reference to the map and analyzing the response of the bicycle. Using the linear approximation obtained, a classical feedback controller for yaw-rate tracking is designed. In addition to yaw-rate control, to track a path the yaw angle of the bicycle must match that of the path and the bicycle must physically be on the path. To analyze these conditions a linear approximation for the distance between the bicycle to the path is found, enabling construction of a linear approximation of the entire system. We then find that by passing the signal for the difference in yaw rate and the <b>distance</b> through separate <b>controllers,</b> summing their output, and subtracting from the reference yaw rate of the path, the bicycle converges to the path. After developing the general design procedure, the final part of the thesis shows a step by step design example and demonstrates the results of applying the proposed control architecture to the nonlinear bicycle model. We highlight some problems that can arise when the bicycle is started far from the path. To overcome these problems we develop the concept of a virtual path, which is a path that when followed returns the bicycle to the actual path. We also recognize that, in practice, typical paths do not have constant curvature, so we construct more practical paths by joining straight line segments and circular arc segments, representing a practical path similar to a path that would be encountered when biking through a series of rural roads. Finally, we finish the design example by demonstrating the performance of the control architecture on such a path. From these simulations we show that using the suggested controller design that the bicycle will converge to a constant curvature path. Additionally with using the controllers we develop that in the absence of disturbance the bicycle will stay within the intended traffic lane when travelling on a typical rural road...|$|R
