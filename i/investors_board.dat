40|$|The {{research}} reported herein {{examines the}} role of institutional <b>investors,</b> <b>board</b> of directors and technological opportunity in relation to international diversification. The conceptual arguments and empirical findings provide a contribution to both agency and foreign direct investment theories. Results from a sample of 197 large U. S. firms indicate statistically significant relationships between the firm’s institutional owners, such as professional investment funds and pension funds, and international diversification. Beyond the main effects, we found that professional investment funds favor international diversification when outside board members are present. Similarly we found higher interest in international diversification by pension funds coupled with strong inside board members representation. The study also showed that the long-term orientation of pension funds better facilitated internationalization in industries with high technological opportunities. The results suggest that separate institutional owners have a different stake in firm international strategies and these differential effects are accentuated when {{the effects of the}} board of directors and technological opportunity are considered.

40|$|Based on {{a five-year}} field study of six new ventures, we {{investigate}} {{whether and how}} organization foun-ders use affective influence, a form of emotion management, with diverse stakeholders, namely <b>investors,</b> <b>board</b> members, customers, and employees. We found wide differences in founders' propensity to use affective influence actions and that not all affective influence actions were effective in mobilizing re-sources for the new firm. We identified a particular form of beneficial affective influence we call "emo-tional assuring," which refers to affective influence actions that seek to build three different dimensions of trust {{in regard to the}} new firm: (1) the firm's integrity, (2) the founder's competence as an entrepreneur, and (3) the founder's benevolent character. Although firms that practiced little emotional assuring could mobilize adequate resources as well as firms that did it in munificent environments, the latter gained an upper hand and were more resilient under tough economic conditions. We also identified the moderating conditions and limitations of emotional assuring.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the trends and endogenous determinants of {{boards of directors}} (board size, composition, and CEO duality) for a sample of 212 US bank holding companies, from 1997 to 2004. Overall, {{the results show that}} {{the costs and benefits of}} boards' monitoring and advising roles could explain bank board structures with caveats. For example, due to the regulatory nature and comparatively intensive scrutiny of bank officers and directors, it is argued that bank managers have less control over the directors' selection processes. Thus, bank board independence should not be the outcome of negotiation with CEOs. Consistent with this view, bank CEOs are found not to affect bank board independence. The trend analysis also provides some important results. In contrast to non-bank evidence, for instance, board size was discovered to decrease over the sample period for large and medium-sized banks, while board size remained relatively stable for small banks. These results are robust with respect to different estimation specifications. Furthermore, the study's findings have important policy implications for bank regulators and <b>investors.</b> <b>Board</b> of directors Independent directors CEO CEO duality Endogenous Bank holding companies...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{four-year}} field study of six new ventures, we investigate {{whether and how}} founders of new firms engaged in affective sensegiving with diverse stakeholders; namely <b>investors,</b> <b>board</b> members, customers and employees. Affective sensegiving refers to founders' integrating affect in their verbal statements and actions to influence stakeholders' understanding of aspects of their young firms (including themselves). We found a subset of affective sensegiving actions - called emotional assuring - that seeks to generate stakeholders' understanding of the young firms or their leaders as displaying: 1) socially valued entrepreneurial characteristics; 2) personal caring, and 3) transparent or inclusive organizing. We show how stakeholders interpret these founders' sensegiving actions and suggest that {{they are likely to}} mobilize resources when they feel emotionally assured because they perceive trustworthiness. Our study enriches the sensegiving literature - which has mainly focused on cognition - by identifying a range of sensegiving actions that include affect and build trust. It also extends the trust literature by specifying managerial actions that build, sometimes simultaneously, cognitive as well as affective trust in the challenging context of creating new firms. Lastly, it contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by unpacking the social construction of start-up organizations through founders' use of affective sensegiving actions.

40|$|AbstractCorporate Governance is {{contemporary}} {{topic in}} business world these days. In today's world when companies are competing on international standards, {{they need to}} be professionally run {{in the best interest of}} <b>investors.</b> <b>Board</b> of Directors (BoD) is the most important body in a company and is responsible for investors’ protection. Corporates are failing in terms of Accountability part whenever question of governance has come. Mousa F. Al Manaseer (2012) expressed that the board of directors is the primary internal governance mechanism charged with overseeing executive decisions. This research aims at studying two Indian companies namely, ITC, a leading Indian conglomerate and ONCG, a public sector undertaking, for the purpose of evaluating both with respect to compliance to SEBI's requirement of clause 49 A and B (pertaining to disclosure, efficiency of board and representation of sufficient number of independent directors in the Board). Researchers are trying to evaluate performance of these two top market capitalization companies in terms of BoD and their governance. For this study, researchers will take secondary data from annual reports of respective companies for the financial year 2012 - 13 (being most recent disclosures).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{influence}} of corporate governance structure on enviromental disclosure of a firm. To measure the corporate governance structure consisting of 5 proxy there are independent board is using the proportion of independent board, institusional ownership is using the percentage of institutional <b>investors,</b> <b>board</b> size is using the total number of commissioners, the proportion of women directors is using the ratio of the number of women directors to the total number of directors and sizes audit committee using the total number of audit committee members in the firm, while to measure the amount of environmental disclosure using the GRI disclosure items. This study also used several control variables are firm size as measured by total assets and operating revenues, profitability is measured using ROA and the type of industry that is measured using a dummy variable. The population in this study consists of all the entire company incorporated in NCSR in year 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The sampling method used in this study is purposive sampling. By doing sampling and processing data, the final amounts of the sample are 60 samples from 15 firms in one year. This study uses linear regression as an analysis technique to examine the hypotheses. The analysis showed that both institutional ownership and audit committee size have significant positive influence on environmental disclosure. While the proportion of independent board of commissioner, board size and proportion of women director did not significantly affect environmental disclosure.

40|$|The {{growth of}} the fund {{management}} industry {{is an important part}} of China&rsquo;s financial development. The contractual form of fund management companies (FMC) organisation in China presents a multiple governance issues in addition to the conventional agency problems associated with modern corporations. The lack of fund investor&rsquo;s voice in the governance of FMC, coupled with a regulatory environment with weak enforcement of investor protection, heightens the need for effective FMC governance in protecting the interests of fund <b>investors.</b> <b>Board</b> effectiveness is usually considered in the literature as the central internal governance mechanisms to enhance investor protection. Financial performance is the key interest for fund investors. Using panel data of 288 firm-year observations covering more than 98 % of FMC in China from 2006 to 2010, this study presents the first in-depth systematic investigation on how the quality of corporate governance may matter in determining board effectiveness and financial performance of the contractual form of FMC organizations by investigating evidence from China where institutional and regulatory environment is quite different from those of funds in the U. S. The results of empirical tests in this study suggest that corporate governance quality is important in determining FMC performance. In examining how key internal governance mechanisms affect FMC board effectiveness and financial performance, we find that FMC with a listed controlling shareholder significantly enhances board effectiveness and improve FMC performance while the presence of foreign ownership in FMC increases FMC fees, it substantially enhances FMC performance. Findings of this study also shows that the concentrated ownership in FMC has no impact on board effectiveness but harms FMC performance. This study shows that larger board has no effect on board effectiveness but harms FMC performance, affirming the ineffectiveness of board size in China and the higher coordination costs impacting negatively on FMC performance. The proportion of independent directors is found to have no impact on either board effectiveness or FMC performance. With its concentrated ownership among FMC and shortage of qualified independent directors in China, it is unlikely that independent directors plays an effective role in monitoring and control, thus resulting in ineffectual board independence in China&rsquo;s current circumstance. While the presence of female senior executives is found to enhance FMC board effectiveness, the impact of female senior executives on FMC performance is not found. Increasing the number of females on board has no impact on board effectiveness but actually damages FMC performance. This study shows the presence of remuneration committee could enhance board effectiveness but has limited power to influence FMC performance. While the presence of remuneration committee can help better align of interests between senior officers in FMC and fund investors, it plays negligible role in retaining Chinese fund managers because of the high turnover rate in Chinese fund managers. Overall, the thesis provides strong evidence that the governance of FMC is important in enhancing the board effectiveness and the financial performance of funds...|$|E
40|$|This study explores {{corporate}} governance (CG) structures {{and practices in}} Jamaica to fill theoretical, practical and public policy gaps. The study is organized into four parts and nine chapters. Part one is {{an introduction to the}} thesis and the contextual setting. Part two explores the theoretical and methodological framework via an in-depth review of the social science literature on CG and sets out the research strategy and methodology. Part three analyses and discusses the findings from the fieldwork, and part four examines gaps, proposes recommendations for reform, discusses conclusions, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research. The study assumes a two-fold hypothesis of a CG problem and public policy problem. The CG problem is characterised by a dearth of empirical literature, a lack of CG awareness, and inadequate and poor CG practices among public bodies. The public policy problem is defined by a weak regulatory framework, systemic weaknesses in the financial sector, and pervasive corporate and political corruption. In seeking solution to the problems under review, the study adapts the interviewer’s administered survey method supported by three in-depth case studies and two focus groups. The views of about 100 respondents were sought and an additional unspecified number of informal informants. This multi-technique approach ensured that the weaknesses of a given technique were compensated for by the counterbalancing strengths of other techniques. The key themes of focus were regulation, corruption, ownership and control, stakeholder relations, perceptions and role of institutional <b>investors,</b> <b>board</b> characteristics and processes and the board’s role in strategic decision-making and corporate disclosures. The findings revealed that while Jamaica has implemented several laws and regulations, there are still gaps in coverage, content and effectiveness of implementation. Corruption is still rampant in spite of evidence of a reduction since 2006 (TI 2008 Report). Ownership and control of Jamaican firms are highly concentrated and mainly by oligarchic groups giving way to such problems as an under-developed new issues market, a high degree of insider boards, inadequate minority protection, poor information disclosure, and incentives are aligned to dominant shareholders. There is a lack of representation and voice of employee and trade union representatives in the Jamaican boardrooms and institutional investors (II), while controlling approximately 75 % of listed companies, are not interested in promoting CG reform over and above the extent to which such efforts would redound to their self-interest. IIs play influential roles in financing Jamaican politics and control large distribution channels, and determine who gets large private sector contracts. While much is being done internationally to achieve gender balance in the boardroom, the mean number of females on Jamaican corporate boards is 1. 8 (or 19. 8 %) with an average board size of 9. 1 Directors. Cross-tabulation analyses were conducted and tests for relationships between and within groups of key variables (board size, Chair/CEO duality, NEDs vs. EDs, number of female Directors with listed and unlisted firms and dominant ownership dispersed vs. closely held) and nothing of significance was found. The study has concluded that reform is needed in several areas. These include increase of coverage and content of legislation and enforcement mechanisms to improve CG and fight corruption; reform of corporate boards - director selection and appointments, board’s role and conduct of Directors, training and board performance evaluation. Future research is directed at more emphasis on CG in developing countries, SMEs, public bodies and non-profit organizations, the role and contribution of employees and trade unions, the board’s role in influencing strategy, and the role of risk management. The study seeks to contribute to the growing body of international literature on emerging CG and targets primarily academics, practitioners and policymakers.
