5|$|Both {{versions}} of the game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregator site Metacritic. The main problems reviewers had with the game was its repetitiveness and the tediousness of some parts. Reviewers highly praised its narrative, and some reviewers {{thought that it would}} work better as a short <b>film,</b> <b>or</b> an audio drama, rather than as a game.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's Soup Company {{sponsored}} the entire nineteen-year run of Lassie. In {{one of the}} first instances of product placement, the company asked that their products be visible on the set and so, in episode after episode, Campbell's products are seen in background shots. Campbell's also contractually required the show's stars to avoid appearing in any <b>film</b> <b>or</b> theatrical production that undermined their All-American images.|$|E

5|$|Copies of the {{developed}} <b>film</b> <b>or</b> summaries prepared by Moyzisch were promptly passed on to senior German leaders. Ribbentrop showed the initial set of photographs to Hitler immediately upon receipt. Hitler entered a conference with some Cicero materials in December 1943 and declared that the invasion in the west would come in spring 1944. He concluded, though, that there would also be attacks in other locations, such as Norway or the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where the author {{has the right to}} be protected from it. The right to object to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a <b>film</b> <b>or</b> sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author can sue when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a <b>film</b> <b>or</b> sound recording of the treatment. For films, the author is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to the public, or when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E

5|$|After {{the liberation}} of France, Clouzot and several other {{directors}} were tried in court for collaborating with the Germans. For his sentence, Clouzot was forbidden from going on set of any <b>film</b> <b>or</b> from using a film camera {{for the rest of}} his life. Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot's sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked with one of his supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been one of the first people to defend Le Corbeau.|$|E

5|$|Burton {{points out}} that many {{conservative}} critics and magazines (John Simon, James Bowman, the World Report) initially either criticized the <b>film</b> <b>or</b> praised it only for its non-political elements. Only after {{the popularity of the}} film was well-established did conservatives embrace the film as an affirmation of traditional values. Burton implies the liberal-left could have prevented the conservatives from claiming rights to the film, had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as the feminist and civil rights movements.|$|E
5|$|It was {{considered}} {{more likely that}} Germany might employ such weapons against the United Kingdom, so four officers from the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) were summoned to Chicago where {{they were given a}} top secret briefing by the Manhattan District's Chicago area engineer, Major Arthur V. Peterson. They were told about possible forms such an attack might take, and what the effects and symptoms of them were, and they were given survey instruments and shown how to use them. They were enjoined to tell other officers in the theater to report unexplained fogging of <b>film</b> <b>or</b> illnesses with symptoms corresponding to the effects of radiation sickness.|$|E
5|$|Messages, many in {{commonly}} used ciphers and encryption systems, {{have been found}} hidden in the video and its sound spectrogram, as well as images of tortured and mutilated people. Most of the messages have been decoded by participants in an ongoing Reddit thread, and the images sourced to notable murder investigations such as the Boston Strangler. They have been interpreted as implying a threat of bioterrorism against the United States, although {{it has also been}} speculated that the video is in reality a prank, a viral marketing stunt for an upcoming <b>film</b> <b>or</b> video game, or a student film.|$|E

5|$|Ray {{followed}} Apur Sansar with Devi (The Goddess), a film {{in which}} he examined the superstitions in Hindu society. Sharmila Tagore starred as Doyamoyee, a young wife who is deified by her father-in-law. Ray was worried that the censor board might block his <b>film,</b> <b>or</b> at least make him re-cut it, but Devi was spared. In 1961, on the insistence of Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Ray was commissioned to make a documentary on Rabindranath Tagore, {{on the occasion of}} the poet's birth centennial, a tribute to the person who likely most influenced Ray. Due to limited footage of Tagore, Ray faced the challenge of making a film out of mainly static material. He said that it took as much work as three feature films.|$|E

An initial street date of August 13, 2002 was announced only to be postponed. A new date of February 3, 2003 was set, only {{for it to be}} recalled again without explanation, although some copies quickly found their way to collectors' venues such as eBay.
