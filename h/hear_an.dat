5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has heard a case, no {{decision}} may be {{reviewed by the}} Court of Appeal. The one exception is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either the High Court or Court of Appeal certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once the High Court {{has decided not to}} allow an appeal, the registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales {{can also}} be {{affected}} by humans in more indirect ways. For species like the North Atlantic right whale, which migrates {{through some of the}} world's busiest shipping lanes, the biggest threat is from being struck by ships. The Lloyd's mirror effect results in low frequency propeller sounds not being discernible near the surface, where most accidents occur. Combined with spreading and acoustic shadowing effects, {{the result is that the}} whale is unable to <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> approaching vessel before it has been run over or entrapped by the hydrodynamic forces of the vessel's passage. A 2014 study noted that a lower vessel speed correlated with lower collision rates. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, notably in the blue whale which produces the loudest vocalization, which makes it harder for them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Poisoning from toxic substances such as Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is generally low because of their low trophic level. Some baleen whales can become victims of bycatch, which is especially serious for North Atlantic right whales considering its small number. Right whales feed with a wide-open mouth, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaw, flippers and tail. Some are able to escape, but others remain entangled. If observers notice, they can be successfully disentangled, but others die over a period of months. Other whales, such as humpback whales, {{can also be}} entangled.|$|E
5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing more {{flexibility}} in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E
5|$|Pound's {{editorial}} {{choices were}} {{based on what he}} saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding {{on the question of the}} renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, I <b>Hear</b> <b>an</b> Army, which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.|$|E

25|$|The first {{practical}} application for piezoelectric devices was sonar, first developed during World War I.
