40|$|Widespread {{overuse of}} the {{herbicide}} glyphosate, {{the active ingredient}} in RoundUp®, {{has led to the}} evolution of glyphosate-resistant weed biotypes, some of which persist by overproducing the herbicide's target enzyme, 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase (EPSPS). EPSPS is a key enzyme in the shikimic acid pathway for biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, lignin, and defensive compounds, but little is known about how overproducing EPSPS affects downstream metabolites, growth, or lifetime fitness in the absence of glyphosate. We are using Arabidopsis as a model system for investigating phenotypic effects of overproducing EPSPS, thereby avoiding confounding effects of genetic background or other mechanisms of herbicide resistance in agricultural weeds. Here, we report results from the first stage of this project. We designed a binary vector expressing a native EPSPS gene from Arabidopsis under control of the CaMV 35 S promoter (labelled OX, for over-expression). <b>For</b> <b>both</b> <b>OX</b> and the empty vector (labelled EV), we obtained nine independent T 3 lines. Subsets of these lines were used to characterize glyphosate resistance in greenhouse experiments. Seven of the nine OX lines exhibited enhanced glyphosate resistance when compared to EV and wild-type control lines, and one of these was discarded due to severe deformities. The remaining six OX lines exhibited enhanced EPSPS gene expression and glyphosate resistance compared to controls. Glyphosate resistance was correlated with the degree of EPSPS over-expression for both vegetative and flowering plants, indicating that glyphosate resistance {{can be used as a}} surrogate for EPSPS expression levels in this system. These findings set the stage for examination of the effects of EPSPS over-expression on fitness-related traits in the absence of glyphosate. We invite other investigators to contact us if they wish to study gene expression, downstream metabolic effects, and other questions with these particular lines...|$|E
40|$|Orexin-A (OR-A) and OR-B {{are derived}} from a common 130 -amino acid {{precursor}} peptide, prepro-OR, by proteolytic cleavage. Orexins orchestrate their actions by binding and activating two types of G protein-coupled receptors, OR- 1 receptor (OX 1 R) and OR- 2 receptor (OX 2 R). Besides {{playing a role in}} the regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis in rats, ORs appear to increase sexual arousal as well as copulatory performance in rats. Furthermore, OR-A and -B immunoreactivity has been detected in rat testis. In view of these findings we investigated the expression of OR receptors and their signaling characteristics in the human male reproductive system. Using RT-PCR analysis, we were able to demonstrate that both OX 1 R and OX 2 R are expressed in the testis, epididymis, penis, and seminal vesicle, whereas prepro-OR was expressed only in the epididymis and penis. Protein expression of both OR receptors in human testis was confirmed by Western blotting analysis, with apparent molecular masses of 50 kDa for OX 1 R and 40 kDa for OX 2 R. Immunofluorescent studies revealed staining <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>OX</b> 1 R and OX 2 R in Leydig cells, myoid cells of the seminiferous tubules, and Sertoli cells. To test the ability of ORs to activate testicular phospholipase C, we determined the effects of OR-A and OR-B on inositol trisphosphate production. When membranes from testicular biopsies were incubated with OR-A or OR-B, there was a rapid inositol trisphosphate turnover. This effect appeared to be dose dependent. These data provide a novel insight into the expression and signaling characteristics of OR receptors in the human male reproductive system and potentially further implicate these peptides, acting in an autocrine/paracrine manner, in the regulation of arousal mechanisms in humans. ...|$|E
40|$|The neuropeptides orexin A and B are {{synthesised}} by perifornical {{and lateral}} hypothalamic (LH) neurones and exert a profound influence on autonomic sympathetic processes. LH neurones project to spinal areas containing sympathetic preganglionic neurones (SPNs) and therefore may directly modulate sympathetic output. In {{the present study}} we examined the possibility that orexinergic inputs from the LH influence SPN activity. Orexin-positive neurones in the LH were labelled with pseudorabies virus injected into the liver of parasympathetically denervated animals and orexin fibres were found adjacent to the soma and dendrites of SPNs. Orexin A or B (10 - 1000 nm) directly and reversibly depolarised SPNs in spinal cord slices. The response to orexin A was significantly reduced {{in the presence of}} the orexin receptor 1 (OX 1 R) antagonist SB 334867 A at concentrations of 1 - 10 mum. Single cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed expression of mRNA <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>OX</b> 1 R and OX 2 R in the majority of orexin-sensitive SPNs. The orexin-induced depolarisation involved activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins and closure of a K+ conductance via a protein kinase A (PKA) -dependent pathway that did not require an increase in intracellular Ca 2 +. Orexins also induced biphasic subthreshold membrane potential oscillations and synchronised activity between pairs of electrically coupled SPNs. Coupling coefficients and estimated junctional conductances between SPNs were not altered indicating synchronisation is due to activation of previously silent coupled neurones rather than modulation of gap junctions. These findings are consistent with a direct excitation and synchronisation of SPNs by orexinergic neurones that in vivo could increase the frequency and coherence of sympathetic nerve discharges and mediate LH effects on sympathetic components of energy homeostasis and cardiovascular control...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNarcolepsy-cataplexy, a {{neurological}} disorder {{associated with the}} absence of hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) neuropeptides, consists of two underlying problems: inability to maintain wakefulness and intrusion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep into wakefulness. Here we document, using behavioral, electrophysiological, and pharmacological criteria, two distinct classes of behavioral arrests exhibited by mice deficient in orexin-mediated signaling. <b>Both</b> <b>OX</b> 2 R−/− and orexin−/− mice are similarly affected with behaviorally abnormal attacks of non-REM sleep (“sleep attacks”) and show similar degrees of disrupted wakefulness. In contrast, OX 2 R−/− mice are only mildly affected with cataplexy-like attacks of REM sleep, whereas orexin−/− mice are severely affected. Absence of OX 2 Rs eliminates orexin-evoked excitation of histaminergic neurons in the hypothalamus, which gate non-REM sleep onset. While normal regulation of wake/non-REM sleep transitions depends critically upon OX 2 R activation, the profound dysregulation of REM sleep control unique to the narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome emerges from loss of signaling through <b>both</b> <b>OX</b> 2 R-dependent and OX 2 R-independent pathways...|$|R
40|$|Orexins A and B are {{hypothalamic}} peptides, {{that act}} via two subtypes of receptors, named OX 1 -R and OX 2 -R. Rat and human adrenal cortexes {{are provided with}} <b>both</b> <b>OX</b> 1 -R and OX 2 -R, and we have previously shown that orexin-A, but not orexin-B, enhances glucocorticoid secretion from dispersed adrenocortical cells. Since OX 1 -Rs preferentially bind orexin-A and OX 2 -Rs are non-selective <b>for</b> <b>both</b> orexins, the hypothesis has been advanced that the secretagogue effect of orexin-A is exclusively mediated by the OX 1 -R. Here, we aimed to verify this contention and to gain insight into the signaling mechanism(s) underlying the secretagogue effect of orexins using primary cultures of rat and human adrenocortical cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that cultured cells, as freshly dispersed cells, expressed <b>both</b> <b>OX</b> 1 -R and OX 2 -R mRNAs. Orexin-A, but not orexin-B, concentration-dependently increased corticosterone and cortisol secretion from cultured rat and human adrenocortical cells, respectively. The blockade of OX 1 -Rs by selective antibodies abrogated the secretagogue effect of orexin-A, while the immuno-blockade of OX 2 -Rs was ineffective. The glucocorticoid response of cultured cells to orexin-A was annulled by the adenylate cyclase and protein kinase (PK) A inhibitors SQ- 22536 and H- 89, and unaffected by the phospholipase C and PKC inhibitors U- 73122 and calphostin-C. Orexin-A, but not orexin-B, enhanced cyclic-AMP production from cultured cells, and did not alter inositol- 3 -phosphate release.

40|$|Although CD 4 (+) memory T cells reside within {{secondary}} lymphoid tissue, {{the major}} reservoir of these cells {{is in the}} lamina propria of the intestine. In this study, we demonstrate that, {{in the absence of}} signals through <b>both</b> <b>OX</b> 40 and CD 30, CD 4 (+) T cells are comprehensively depleted from the lamina propria. Deficiency in either CD 30 or OX 40 alone reduced CD 4 (+) T cell numbers, however, in mice deficient in <b>both</b> <b>OX</b> 40 and CD 30, CD 4 (+) T cell loss was greatly exacerbated. This loss of CD 4 (+) T cells was not due to a homing defect because CD 30 x OX 40 -deficient OTH cells were not impaired in their ability to express CCR 9 and alpha(4) beta(7) or traffic to the small intestine. There was also no difference in the priming of wild-type (WT) and CD 30 x OX 40 -deficient OTH cells in the mesenteric lymph node after oral immunization. However, following oral immunization, CD 30 x OX 40 -deficient OTH cells trafficked to the lamina propria but failed to persist compared with WT OTH cells. This was not due to reduced levels of Bcl- 2 or Bcl-XL, because expression of these was comparable between wT and double knockout OTH cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that signals through CD 30 and OX 40 are required for the survival of CD 4 (+) T cells within the small intestine lamina propria.

Primary root length, number of lateral root primordia, root apical meristem (RAM) length and epidermal cell length were recorded. Three genotypes were used: wild type (WT) and transgenic lines expressing either Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp) cdc 25 or over-expressing(oe) Arath;WEE 1. All treatments promoted primary root elongation but repressed lateral root production.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) combined with CD 34 + hematopoietic/stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) can function as surrogate urinary bladder cells to synergistically promote multi-faceted bladder tissue regeneration. However, the molecular pathways governing these events are unknown. The pleiotropic effects of Wnt 5 a and Cyr 61 are known to affect aspects of hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and muscle and nerve regeneration. Within this study, the effects of Cyr 61 and Wnt 5 a on bladder tissue regeneration were evaluated by grafting scaffolds containing modified human bone marrow derived MSCs. These cell lines were engineered to independently over-express Wnt 5 a or Cyr 61, or to exhibit reduced expression of Cyr 61 {{within the context of a}} nude rat bladder augmentation model. At 4 weeks post-surgery, data demonstrated increased vessel number (~ 250 vs ~ 109 vessels/mm 2) and bladder smooth muscle content (~ 42 % vs ~ 36 %) in Cyr 61 OX (over-expressing) vs Cyr 61 KD (knock-down) groups. Muscle content decreased to ~ 25 % at 10 weeks in Cyr 61 KD groups. Wnt 5 aOX resulted in high numbers of vessels and muscle content (~ 206 vessels/mm 2 and ~ 51 %, respectively) at 4 weeks. Over-expressing cell constructs resulted in peripheral nerve regeneration while Cyr 61 KD animals were devoid of peripheral nerve regeneration at 4 weeks.

40|$|Orexin {{makes an}} {{important}} contribution to the regulation of cardiovascular function. When injected centrally under anesthesia, orexin increases blood pressure, heart rate and sympathetic nerve activity. This is consistent with the location of orexin neurons in the hypothalamus and the distribution of orexin terminals in the central autonomic network. Thus, the two orexin receptors, Ox 1 R and Ox 2 R, which have partly overlapping distribution in the brain, are expressed in the sympathetic preganglionic neurons of the thoracic cord as well as in regions such as the pressor area of the rostral ventrolateral medulla. <b>Both</b> <b>Ox</b> 1 R and Ox 2 R appear to contribute to the cardiovascular effects of orexin, although Ox 1 R is probably more important. Blockade of orexin receptors reduces the cardiovascular response to certain stressors, especially psychogenic stressors such as novelty, aggressive conspecifics and induced panic. Blockade of orexin receptors also reduces basal blood pressure and heart rate in spontaneous hypertensive rats, a model of essential hypertension.

Objectives Here, we asked whether orexin and glutamate interact within ventral tegmental area (VTA) to promote reinstatement of extinguished cocaine seeking in a rat selfadministration paradigm. Methods/results We first found that bilateral VTA microinjections of the orexin 1 receptor (OX 1 R) antagonist SB- 334867 (SB) or a cocktail of the AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX/AP- 5 reduced reinstatement of cocaine seeking elicited by cues. In contrast, neither of these microinjections nor systemic SB reduced cocaineprimed reinstatement. Additionally, unilateral VTA OX 1 R blockade combined with contralateral VTA glutamate blockade attenuated cue-induced reinstatement, indicating that VTA orexin and glutamate are simultaneously necessary for cueinduced reinstatement. We further probed the receptor specificity of glutamate actions in VTA, finding that CNQX, but not AP- 5, dose-dependently attenuated cue-induced reinstatement, indicating that AMPA but not NMDA receptor transmission is required {{for this type of}} cocaine seeking. Given the necessary roles of <b>both</b> <b>OX</b> 1 and AMPA receptors in VTA for cue-induced cocaine seeking, we hypothesized that these signaling pathways interact during this behavior.

For a millet-only farmer in Niger, ox traction yields insufficient returns and donkey traction is attractive only when sufficient amount of capital are available to include a cart in the investment package. Similarly, in a millet-cowpea systems, <b>both</b> <b>ox</b> traction and donkey traction yield acceptable returns only with a cart. In northern Nigeria, where relatively few donkeys are used for work, ox traction investments are profitable only with subsidised credit. However, profitability of animal traction investments in both Niger and Nigeria depends critically on the availability of fallow land. When a closed or nearly closed land frontier effectively limits the scope for area increases, returns on animal traction investments generally fall below critical levels. Adoption of animal traction technologies is likely to be increased by the development and dissemination of cheaper implements in Niger and a cheaper cart in Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|Orexin-A and orexin-B are {{hypothalamic}} neuropeptides {{that play}} critical {{roles in the}} maintenance of wakefulness. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of orexin-A {{has been shown to}} promote wakefulness and suppress both rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep through the orexin receptor- 1 (OX 1 R) and orexin receptor- 2 (OX 2 R). Here, we elucidated the differential roles of orexin receptors in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness by comparing the effects of ICV orexin-A administration in wild-type, OX 1 R, and OX 2 R mice. The effects of orexin-A on wakefulness and NREM sleep were significantly attenuated in both knock-out mice as compared with wild-type mice, with substantially larger attenuation in OX 2 R mice than in OX 1 R mice. These results suggest that although the OX 2 R-mediated pathway has a pivotal role in the promotion of wakefulness, OX 1 R also plays additional roles in promoting arousal. In contrast, suppression of REM sleep by orexin-A administration was slightly and similarly attenuated in <b>both</b> <b>OX</b> 1 R and OX 2 R mice, suggesting a comparable contribution of the two receptors to REM sleep suppression. Histological studies demonstrated differential distributions of each receptor subtype in distinct neuronal populations with specific neurotransmitter identities in brainstem cholinergic/monoaminergic neurons. In the laterodorsal tegmental and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei especially, cholinergic neurons exclusively expressed OX 1 R mRNA, but OX 2 R mRNA was expressed mainly in GABAergic putative interneurons. Thus, each orexin receptor subtype plays differential roles in gating NREM and REM sleep through distinct neuronal pathways. © 2011 by the authors. 発行後 1 年より全文公開...|$|R

We show that MMP- 2 directly stimulates dendritic cells (DCs) to <b>both</b> upregulate <b>OX</b> 40 L on the cell surface and secrete inflammatory cytokines. The mechanism underlying DC activation includes physical association with Toll-like receptor- 2 (TLR 2), leading to NF-κB activation, OX 40 L upregulation on DCs, and ensuing TH 2 differentiation. Significantly, MMP- 2 polarizes T cells toward type 2 responses in vivo, in a TLR 2 -dependent manner. MMP- 2 -dependent type 2 polarization may represent a key immune regulatory mechanism for protection against {{a broad array of}} disorders, such as inflammatory, infectious, and autoimmune diseases, which can be hijacked by tumors to evade immunity...|$|R
