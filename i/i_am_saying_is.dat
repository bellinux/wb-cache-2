I'm really excited about it." [...] Ora also talked about preparing for the video in June, [...] "It is going to be amazing; I can't even tell you what's going to happen because I am sworn to secrecy. It is going to be major. You've seen her video for [...] "Fancy"? She loves a theme and the theme for this one is fucking genius. All <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> I am in training for days for this video." [...] The video was shot in mid-July in Los Angeles. On 8 August 2014 during a performance, Ora announced that the video should premiere officially on 11 August 2014. On 11 August 2014, a 16-second teaser for [...] "Black Widow" [...] was uploaded on Azalea's VEVO channel. The video was directed by Director X and Iggy Azalea and premiered through VEVO on 13 August 2014. Daps was the second unit director for the music video. American actors Michael Madsen, Paul Sorvino, and actor/rapper T.I. also appear in the video. On 14 August 2014, exclusive behind-the-scenes footage from the video set was shown on the second episode of MTV's show House of Style, hosted by Azalea and where she revealed the visuals are inspired by 70s kung fu films and Tarantino movies.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, no, I {{beg your}} pardon,' {{retorted}} the Old Soldier. 'With nobody present, but our dear and confidential friend Mr. Wickfield, I cannot consent {{to be put}} down. I shall begin to assert the privileges of a mother-in-law, {{if you go on}} like that, and scold you. I am perfectly honest and outspoken. What <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying,</b> <b>is</b> what I said when you first overpowered me with surprise--you remember how surprised I was?--by proposing for Annie. Not that there was anything so very much out of the way, in the mere fact of the proposal--it would be ridiculous to say that!--but because, you having known her poor father, and having known her from a baby six months old, I hadn't thought of you in such a light at all, or indeed as a marrying man in any way,--simply that, you know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is,</b> {{that as you}} and Bill {{were both}} after her, and as you are both broke with her, and seeing that Bill's {{provided}} himself like--" ...|$|R

6000|$|They then {{returned}} to the state of affairs, as it was between Tifto and Lord Silverbridge. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> this," [...] continued the Captain. [...] "If you choose to put yourself up to live with a fellow like that on equal terms--" ...|$|R
6000|$|I was {{reared in}} the same village with her. I played with her every day, {{when we were little}} {{children}} together, just as you play with your mates. Now that we perceive how great she was, now that her name fills the whole world, it seems strange that what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> true; for it is as if a perishable paltry candle should speak of the eternal sun riding in the heavens and say, [...] "He was gossip and housemate to me when we were candles together." [...] And yet it is true, just as I say. I was her playmate, and I fought at her side in the wars; to this day I carry in my mind, fine and clear, the picture of that dear little figure, with breast bent to the flying horse's neck, charging {{at the head of the}} armies of France, her hair streaming back, her silver mail plowing steadily deeper and deeper into the thick of the battle, sometimes nearly drowned from sight by tossing heads of horses, uplifted sword-arms, wind-blow plumes, and intercepting shields. I was with her to the end; and when that black day came whose accusing shadow will lie always upon the memory of the mitered French slaves of England who were her assassins, and upon France who stood idle and essayed no rescue, my hand was the last she touched in life.|$|E
60|$|When grown-up persons {{indulge in}} {{practical}} jokes, the fact gauges them. They have lived narrow, obscure, and ignorant lives, and at full manhood they still retain and cherish a job-lot of left-over standards and ideals {{that would have}} been discarded with their boyhood if they had then moved out into the world and a broader life. There were many practical jokers in the new Territory. I do not take pleasure in exposing this fact, for I liked those people; but what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> true. I wish I could say a kindlier thing about them instead--that they were burglars, or hat-rack thieves, or something like that, that wouldn't be utterly uncomplimentary. I would prefer it, but I can't say those things, they would not be true. These people were practical jokers, and I will not try to disguise it. In other respects they were plenty good-enough people; honest people; reputable and likable. They played practical jokes upon each other with success, and got the admiration and applause and also the envy {{of the rest of the}} community. Naturally they were eager to try their arts on big game, and that was what the Governor was. But they were not able to score. They made several efforts, but the Governor defeated these efforts without any trouble and went on smiling his pleasant smile as if nothing had happened. Finally the joker chiefs of Carson City and Virginia City conspired together to see if their combined talent couldn't win a victory, for the jokers were getting into a very uncomfortable place: the people were laughing at them, instead of at their proposed victim. They banded themselves together to the number of ten and invited the Governor to what was a most extraordinary attention in those days--pickled oyster stew and champagne--luxuries very seldom seen in that region, and existing rather as fabrics of the imagination than as facts.|$|E
5000|$|What <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> ... <b>is</b> this, {{that without}} a World Encyclopaedia to hold men's minds {{together}} in something like a common interpretation of reality, {{there is no hope}} whatever of anything but an accidental and transitory alleviation of any of our world troubles.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's when you've got {{anything}} {{to leave behind}} you, which hain't the case with you, governor, just at present. But what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> this. He'll know well enough that you can split upon his son hafter he's gone, every bit {{as well as you}} can split on him now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay; and I {{see what}} the pa'son don't see. Why, Shiner is for putting forward that young woman that only last night <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>was</b> our Dick's sweet-heart, but <b>I</b> suppose can't <b>be,</b> and making much {{of her in the}} sight of the congregation, and {{thinking}} he'll win her by showing her off. Well, perhaps 'a woll." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When I {{originally}} {{wrote the}} liner notes, {{it was about}} 5,000 words longer and included all {{the reasons why the}} songs didn't make it, which <b>I</b> thought <b>was</b> kind of interesting. It ended up feeling kind of negative, like so much of what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>was</b> why the songs weren't good enough. It seemed like a strange thing to put in the liner notes. Why would anyone want to buy something like that?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Indian grammarian-philosopher Bhartrhari (late {{fifth century}} AD) {{was well aware}} of a liar paradox which he {{formulated}} as [...] "everything <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> false" [...] (sarvam mithyā bravīmi). He analyzes this paradox together with the paradox of [...] "unsignifiability" [...] and explores the boundary between statements that are unproblematic in daily life and paradoxes.|$|E
5000|$|In a nutshell, [...] "Phendula" [...] is {{a prayer}} to God {{asking for the}} {{eradication}} of human suffering and hardship. Zahara, in her own words, said: [...] "My single Phendula talks about seeking answers from God. A lot is happening from people being victims of crime. There's a lot of poverty and unemployment. All <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> that God should answer our prayers".|$|E
5000|$|In {{the chapter}} dealing with logical and {{linguistic}} relations, the Sambandha-samuddeśa, Bhartrhari discusses several statements of a paradoxical nature, including sarvam mithyā bravīmi [...] "everything <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> false" [...] which {{belongs to the}} liar paradox family, {{as well as the}} paradox arising from the statement that something is unnameable or unsignifiable (in Sanskrit: avācya): this becomes nameable or signifiable precisely by calling it unnameable or unsignifiable.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly. It is full {{of crises}} and catastrophes, and ends {{with the death of}} one of the actors. The tragedy of marriage, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> <b>is</b> one <b>I</b> shall not <b>be</b> a party to your {{beginning}} with such light hearts, and I shall feel bound to put your father on his guard, Miss Everard. Think better of it, I entreat you! Remember the proverb, [...] "Marry in haste and repent at leisure."' ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1983 interview, Bono {{indicated}} that the song {{was the source of}} controversy due to misinterpretation of the verse [...] "I believe in a third World War / I believe in the atomic bomb / I believe in the powers that be / But they won’t overpower me" [...] by fans who questioned his motives. The singer explained that [...] "all <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>was</b> that the realities of the bomb must be faced." ...|$|R

50|$|I {{want you}} to hear me tonight, I am not saying that President Obama is the Antichrist, I am not saying that at all. One reason I know he's not the Antichrist is the Antichrist is going to have much higher poll numbers when he comes. President Obama is not the Antichrist. But what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> this: the course he is {{choosing}} to lead our nation is paving the way for the future reign of the Antichrist.|$|E
5000|$|Following the inquest the coroner, Mr Peter Bedford, {{recorded}} an open verdict commenting, [...] "I am {{not saying}} Mr Berezovsky took his own life, I {{am not saying}} Mr Berezovsky was unlawfully killed. What <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> that {{the burden of proof}} sets such a high standard it is impossible for me to say." [...] He specifically cited the Brinkmann report as casting reasonable doubt on the suicide theory, even through Brinkmann {{had not been able to}} personally examine the body and could not be considered impartial.|$|E
5000|$|... "Life {{experiences}} {{and also the}} travel experiences I’ve had while performing music from my last album Loliwe." [...] — Zahara speaking on the inspiration behind Phendula. In {{an interview with the}} Heralds Yoliswa Sobuwa, Zahara was asked to describe her second studio album. She said: [...] "I am so excited about this album. My fans will love it as Ive grown a lot vocally and also in my writing skills". Moreover, she elaborated on the albums lead single, [...] "Phendula", saying: [...] "My single Phendula talks about seeking answers from God. A lot is happening from people being victims of crime.

5000|$|A {{woman in}} therapy {{continues}} to theorise her experience to her therapist - 'It {{seems to me}} that being psycho-analysed is essentially a process where one is forced back into infantilism...intellectual primitivism' - despite knowing that she 'would get no answer to it, or at least, not on the level I wanted, since I knew that what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>was</b> the [...] "intellectualising" [...] to which she attributed my emotional troubles'.|$|R

5000|$|The GYC annual gatherings have {{generated}} controversy within the Adventist community by Progressive Adventist. One {{of the authors}} for Spectrum, an independent (liberal) Adventist magazine, wrote, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> that emotional, anti-intellectual, conservative movements like GYC don’t accomplish much {{in the long run}} {{in spite of all the}} hoopla. They are ineffective in achieving their own long-term goals and can be spiritually harmful to the young innocents who blame themselves for delaying the Second Advent." [...] Ervin Taylor, writing for the Progressive Adventist magazine Adventist Today, criticized the movement, challenging claims that GYC is a grass-roots organization and pointing to tax documents showing GYC is well funded. He also suggested that GYC has a conservative ideology.|$|E
5000|$|Where Did You Go? Out. What Did You Do? Nothing is {{a nostalgic}} {{evocation}} of the inner life of childhood. It advocates the value of privacy to children; the importance of unstructured time; the joys of boredom; and the virtues of freedom from adult supervision. He opens by saying [...] "The thing is, I don't understand what kids do with themselves any more." [...] He contrasts the overstructured, overscheduled, oversupervised suburban life of {{the child in the}} suburban 1950's with reminiscences of his own childhood. He concludes [...] "I guess what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> that people who don't have nightmares don't have dreams. If you will excuse me, I have an appointment with myself to sit on the front steps and watch some grass growing." ...|$|E
5000|$|McWilliams {{questions}} Ireland's continued {{participation in}} the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union in his books. In an interview with Irish broadcaster Marian Finucane, on RTÉ (17 January 2009) and reported in the international press, McWilliams argues: [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is,</b> that in Europe, if Ireland continues hurtling down this road, which is close to default, the whole of Europe will be badly affected, {{the credibility of the}} euro will be badly affected[...]. It is very essential that we go to Europe and say we have a serious problem. … the way we get out of this is either - there are two options - either, we default, or we pull out of the euro. If we have a single currency, there are obligations and responsibilities on both sides. The idea that France and Germany can just hang us out to dry - as has been the talk the past few days - should not be taken lying down." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{raise my}} voice in Italy and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> silent in India, because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> and <b>I</b> {{live in the}} present, because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> made of dreams, of emptiness, of wine, and of wheat, they call me MAN.

5000|$|When confronted {{about her}} [...] "out of business" [...] {{statement}} while campaigning in West Virginia, Clinton stated [...] "I don't {{know how to}} explain it other than what <b>I</b> said <b>was</b> totally out of context for what I meant because <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> talking about helping coal country for a very long time. It was a misstatement because what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> {{the way things are going}} now, they will continue to lose jobs. It didn't mean that we were going to do it.

He replied [...] "One day they might." [...] Hoon continued, [...] "I accept that in the short term the consequences are terrible. No one minimises those and I'm not seeking to do so," [...] he said. [...] "But what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> that this is a country that has been brutalised for decades by this appalling regime and that the restoration of that country to its own people, the possibility of their deciding for themselves their future ... and indeed {{the way in which they}} go about their lives, ultimately, yes, that will be a better place for people in Iraq." ...|$|E

He was subsequently sued by the university for libel, with the lawyer representing the university in the case saying that, [...] "Mr. Williams' allegations about McMaster are on a par with UFO reports and JFK conspiracy theories...the notion that because there are people on faculty from Egypt that McMaster is then a haven for terrorism is not only logically offensive, it smacks of racism." [...] The publisher later apologized for allowing Williams to print statements which [...] "were without basis in fact". But Williams remained defiant saying, [...] "I love them coming after us.
