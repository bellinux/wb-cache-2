5|$|In {{assisted}} reproductive technology, sperm washing is {{not necessary}} for males with hepatitis B to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated. In females with hepatitis B, the risk of transmission from mother to child with IVF <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the risk in spontaneous conception.|$|E
5|$|Hume criticised {{the view}} that we cannot speak about God, and {{proposed}} that this view <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E

Ultrasound <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> 'normal' (audible) sound in its physical properties, except in that humans cannot hear it. Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20 kHz up to several gigahertz.|$|E

25|$|Thiele and Ladiges' {{arrangement}} remained current {{only until}} 1999, when George's {{treatment of the}} genus for the Flora of Australia series of monographs was published. This was essentially a revision of George's 1981 arrangement, which took into account some of Thiele and Ladiges' data, but rejected their overall arrangement. With respect to B.ser. Dryandroideae, George's 1999 arrangement <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that of 1981.|$|E
25|$|In {{males with}} {{hepatitis}} B, The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine advises that sperm washing {{is not necessary}} in IVF to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated. In females with hepatitis B, the risk of vertical transmission during IVF <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the risk in spontaneous conception. However, {{there is not enough}} evidence to say that ICSI procedures are safe in females with hepatitis B in regard to vertical transmission to the offspring.|$|E
25|$|Some bank {{accounts}} are afforded an extra degree of privacy. Information concerning such accounts, known as numbered accounts, {{is restricted to}} senior bank officers, rather than being accessible to all the employees of a bank. However, the information required to open such an account <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that of an ordinary account; completely anonymous accounts are not allowed by law. Should a criminal investigation take place, law enforcement has access to information related to a numbered account {{in the same way}} it has access to information about any other account.|$|E

25|$|Shortly thereafter, Cristal and {{her boyfriend}} Zack Carey, the {{entertainment}} director at the Stardust, visit Cheetah's and request a lap dance from Nomi. Although the bisexual Cristal is attracted to Nomi, her request is also based upon her desire to humiliate Nomi by proving she {{is little more than}} a prostitute. Nomi reluctantly performs the lap dance after Cristal offers her $500. James happens to be at the strip club as well and witnesses the lap dance. He visits Nomi's trailer the next morning and, like Cristal, tells Nomi that what she is doing <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> prostitution.|$|E
25|$|In {{its basic}} operations, the Israel Lobby <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the farm lobby, steel or textile workers’ unions, or other ethnic lobbies. There is nothing {{improper}} about American Jews and their Christian allies attempting to sway US policy: the Lobby’s activities {{are not a}} conspiracy of the sort depicted in tracts like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. For the most part, the individuals and groups that comprise it are only doing what other special interest groups do, but doing it very much better. By contrast, pro-Arab interest groups, {{in so far as}} they exist at all, are weak, which makes the Israel Lobby’s task even easier.|$|E

Her uniforms resemble Sailor Moon's, colored primarily in cherry blossom pink and red, with a prominent motif of small hearts, joined later by crescent moons and stars. Due to her small stature, certain details of her uniforms are slightly abbreviated. She is given various titles throughout the series, including Princess Soldier, Apprentice Soldier, and Soldier in Training. As the daughter of Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask, she exhibits traits of both parents in battle. Her personality <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> when she is a civilian, although certain powers are unavailable to her in that form.|$|E

25|$|That New England states, in general, regard {{cities and}} towns on equal footing, yet they are handled in two {{different}} ways by the Census Bureau, can be another source of confusion. The Census classifications should not be understood to imply that cities are incorporated but towns are not, or that {{cities and towns}} represent two fundamentally different types of entities. Note that the Census classifies New England municipalities strictly based on whether they are towns or cities, with no regard to the actual population-distribution pattern in a particular municipality. All municipalities titled as cities are classified as incorporated places, even if their population-distribution pattern <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that of a typical town; towns are never classified as incorporated places, {{even if they are}} thoroughly built-up. The ambiguity over whether certain municipalities in Massachusetts should be classified as cities or towns, and the Census Bureau's inconsistent handling of these municipalities (see the Statistics and Superlatives section below), further blurs matters.|$|E

Now David Cameron <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Tony Blair and Gordon Brown <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> David Cameron. They're all cut from the same cloth and it annoys me that the biggest political icon in the last 30 years has been Margaret Thatcher. Someone who tried to destroy the working class. It freaks me out. So I don't really think there's anything left to vote for. I believe that I, as a person, can only change things once every 5 years and that's by voting, and my point is that even casting that vote means that the same guy gets in, the only difference is one has a red tie and the other has a blue one." ...|$|E

500|$|On 27 March, {{in protest}} against Bal Thackeray's editorial, leaders of Shiv Sena in Delhi {{resigned}} citing its [...] "outrageous conduct" [...] towards non-Marathis in Maharashtra {{and announced that}} they will form a separate party. Addressing a press conference Shiv Sena's North India chief Jai Bhagwan Goyal said the decision to leave the party was taken because of the [...] "partial attitude" [...] of the party high command towards Maharashtrians. [...] "Shiv Sena <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Khalistan and Jammu and Kashmir militant groups which are {{trying to create a}} rift between people along regional lines. The main aim of these forces is to split our country. Like the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, the Shiv Sena too has demeaned North Indians and treated them inhumanely", he said.|$|E
500|$|Rock Paper Shotgun writer Alec Meer {{argued that}} Microsoft's intent for this data {{collection}} lacked transparency, stating that [...] "there is no {{world in which}} 45pages of policy documents and opt-out settings split across 13different settings screens and an external website constitutes 'real transparency'." [...] ExtremeTech pointed out that, while previously scroogling against Google for similar data collection strategies, Microsoft now hoovers up your data {{in ways that would}} make Google jealous." [...] However, it was also pointed out that the requirement for such vast usage of customer data had become a norm, citing the increased reliance on cloud computing and other forms of external processing, as well as similar data collection requirements for services on mobile devices such as Google Now and Siri. In August 2015, Russian politician Nikolai Levichev called for Windows10 to be banned from use within the Russian government, as it sends user data to servers in the United States. The country had passed a federal law requiring all online services to store the data of Russian users on servers within the country by September 2016, or be blocked. Writing for ZDNet, Ed Bott said that the lack of complaints by businesses about privacy in Windows10 indicated [...] "how utterly normal those privacy terms are in 2015." [...] In a Computerworld editorial, Preston Gralla stated that [...] "the kind of information Windows10 gathers <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> what other operating systems gather. But Microsoft is held to a different standard than other companies." ...|$|E
