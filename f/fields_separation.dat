We present a method which consists in stacking the data not in time as it is done by the standard radon transform, but in the time-scale plane. This process enables different applications. In case of sev-eral non dispersive crossing wave fields, the algorithm is able to detect the different waves and to separate them. In case of a dispersive wave field, a new approach of dis-persion estimation is presented. The tools are illustrated with synthetic data, in order to present clearly the algo-rithm...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{materials}} exhibit non-linear, hysteretic, {{and dynamic}} characteristics due to presence of classical eddy and anomalous losses. Various dynamic models {{based on the}} original Jiles-Atherton (JA) approach {{have been reported in}} the literature but they show a physical uncertainty about their energy considerations. These models show some non-physical situations in the form of vertical lengthening of hysteresis loops. This paper presents two inverse dynamic models based on the JA approach and the <b>field</b> <b>separation</b> theory. It explains the energy aspects of the JA model and suggests an alternative approach based on the <b>field</b> <b>separation</b> for inclusion of dynamic losses. Comparisons of performances of the two models on measured dynamic hysteresis loops for non-oriented and grain-oriented materials are given.

The long-ranged DEP force can compete with the hydrodynamic force by alternating current electro-osmosis (ACEO) over the entire illumination area for realizing effective <b>field</b> <b>separation</b> {{of particles}}. In the OEFS system, the codirectional illumination and observation induce the levitation effect, compensating the attenuation of the DEP force under LIG illumination by slightly floating particles from the surface. Results of the <b>field</b> <b>separation</b> and concentration of diverse particle pairs (0. 82 – 16 μm) are well demonstrated, and conditions determining the critical radius and effective particle manipulation are discussed. The OEFS with codirectional LIG strategy could be a promising particle manipulation method in many applications where a rapid manipulation of biological cells and particles over the entire working area are of interest...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEye {{induction}} and eye <b>field</b> <b>separation</b> are {{the earliest}} events during vertebrate eye development. Both {{of these processes}} occur much earlier than the formation of optic vesicles. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway appears to be essential for eye induction, yet it remains unclear how IGF downstream pathways are involved in eye induction. As a consequence of eye induction, a single eye anlage is specified in the anterior neural plate. Subsequently, this single eye anlage {{is divided into two}} symmetric eye fields in response to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) secreted from the prechordal mesoderm. Here, we report that B 56 ε regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A) is involved in Xenopus eye induction and subsequent eye <b>field</b> <b>separation.</b> We provide evidence that B 56 ε is required for the IGF/PI 3 K/Akt pathway and that interfering with the PI 3 K/Akt pathway inhibits eye induction. In addition, we show that B 56 ε regulates the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway during eye <b>field</b> <b>separation.</b> Thus, B 56 ε is involved in multiple signaling pathways and plays critical roles during early development...|$|R

30|$|We {{adopted the}} {{geomagnetic}} observations of 68 intense geomagnetic storms (Dst[*]≤[*]− 100 nT) at four Dst geomagnetic observatories recorded from 2000 to 2013. The standard method for Dst index derivation reported by Sugiura and Kamei (1991) and the internal/external <b>field</b> <b>separation</b> technique {{introduced in the}} last section were utilized. The objectives were to investigate the observational performances of geomagnetic induction from internal induced currents of the Earth and the possible divergence of their contributions to Dst variations with different intensities to improve the accuracy in Dst prediction.|$|R

30|$|The basic CI {{algorithm}} {{is presented in}} Sabaka and Olsen (2006) where the magnetic fields from all major near-Earth current sources are parameterized and then co-estimated to obtain optimal <b>field</b> <b>separation.</b> This co-estimation approach {{is the key to}} the superior results obtained because it eliminates ambiguities between parameters spaces. Technically, the basic CI {{algorithm is}} an iterative Gauss-Newton (GN) least-squares estimator (Seber and Wild, 2003), which derives the model parameters from Swarm vector magnetometer measurements. While its application to the Swarm E 2 E simulator (Sabaka and Olsen, 2006) showed promising performance in field recoverability, it still lacked several features that would render it a truly competent algorithm for the generation of actual Level- 2 products. For instance, the basic algorithm did not allow for surface measurements such as observatory hourly-means (OHM) data, which are known to greatly enhance <b>field</b> <b>separation.</b> Estimation of the rotation between the VFM and CRF system for vector measurements mentioned above was not included in the basic algorithm. The a priori conductivity model assumed for ionospheric induction was 1 -dimensional (1 D) rather than 3 -dimensional (3 D) in its variation. Finally, the formal treatment of measurement and theory errors was very primitive and not considered versatile enough for actual mission application.|$|R
40|$|Devices {{based on}} {{differential}} mobility spectrometry (DMS) {{are used in}} a number of ways, including applications as ion prefilters for API-MS systems, as detectors or selectors in hybrid instruments (GC-DMS, DMS-IMS), and in standalone systems for chemical detection and identification. DMS ion separation is based on the relative difference between high field and low field ion mobility known as the alpha dependence, and requires the application of an intense asymmetric electric field known as the DMS <b>separation</b> <b>field,</b> typically in the megahertz frequency range. DMS performance depends on the waveform and on the magnitude of this <b>separation</b> <b>field.</b> In this paper, we analyze the relationship between separation waveform and DMS resolution and consider feasible <b>separation</b> <b>field</b> generators. We examine ideal and practical DMS <b>separation</b> <b>field</b> waveforms and discuss <b>separation</b> <b>field</b> generator circuit types and their implementations. To facilitate optimization of the generator designs, we present a set of relations that connect ion alpha dependence to DMS <b>separation</b> <b>fields.</b> Using these relationships we evaluate the DMS separation power of common generator types as a function of their waveform parameters. Optimal waveforms for the major types of DMS separation generators are determined for ions with various alpha dependences. These calculations are validated by comparison with experimental data...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate sound scattering by an object using a two-surface measurement technique that separates the incident field and the scattered <b>field.</b> The <b>separation</b> technique is developed in cartesian and cylindrical coordinates. The decomposition method in the cartesian coordinate system is based on the principle that any wave form can be decomposed into plane-wave components by using a two dimensional spatial Fourier transform. For the cylindrical coordinate system, a two plane separation technique is based on decomposing the sound field into cylindrical waves. Numerical simulations are performed and the effect of various parameters are investigated. Specifically, the distance between two measurement surfaces, the distance between measurement points, and the aperture size are investigated. In addition, experimental studies were conducted inside an anechoic chamber with a baffled loudspeaker as a source, illuminating four different scatterers. The decomposed scattered field is then used to estimate the far-field target strength. The experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the <b>field</b> <b>separation</b> technique...|$|R

The role of the DMI is determined by analyzing the amplitude and phase distributions of dynamic magnetic excitations calculated with frequency- and time-domain calculation methods.

40|$|Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is {{a severe}} human genetic disease {{affecting}} craniofacial development, with an incidence {{of up to}} 1 / 250 human conceptions and 1. 3 per 10, 000 live births. Mutations in the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) gene result in HPE in humans and mice, and the Shh pathway is targeted by other mutations that cause HPE. However, at least 12 loci are associated with HPE in humans, suggesting that defects in other pathways contribute to this disease. Although the TGIF 1 (TG-interacting factor) gene maps to the HPE 4 locus, and heterozygous loss of function TGIF 1 mutations are associated with HPE, mouse models have not yet explained how loss of Tgif 1 causes HPE. Using a conditional Tgif 1 allele, we show that mouse embryos lacking both Tgif 1 and the related Tgif 2 have HPE-like phenotypes reminiscent of Shh null embryos. Eye and nasal <b>field</b> <b>separation</b> is defective, and forebrain patterning is disrupted in embryos lacking both Tgifs. Early anterior patterning is relatively normal, but expression of Shh is reduced in the forebrain, and Gli 3 expression is up-regulated throughout the neural tube. Gli 3 acts primarily as an antagonist of Shh function, {{and the introduction of}} a heterozygous Gli 3 mutation into embryos lacking both Tgif genes partially rescues Shh signaling, nasal <b>field</b> <b>separation,</b> and HPE. Tgif 1 and Tgif 2 are transcriptional repressors that limit Transforming Growth Factor b/Nodal signaling, and we show that reducing Nodal signaling in embryos lacking both Tgifs reduces the severity of HPE and partially restores the output of Shh signaling. Together, these results support a model in which Tgif function limits Nodal signaling to maintain the appropriate output o...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAs a {{preprocessing}} {{technique of}} nearfield acoustic holography, sound <b>field</b> <b>separation</b> technique could separate the non-free field into two parts: the outgoing {{field and the}} incoming field. Generally, the former is used for sound source reconstruction. In fact, the outgoing field consists of the field radiated by the source in a free-field and the field scattered on the source surface caused by the incoming field. When the scattered field could not be neglected, the reconstruction using the outgoing field would be erroneous. To separate the radiated field and scattered field, a free-field recovery technique using the spherical wave superposition method is proposed.

This is a complex and subjective procedure where the investigator’s decisions are needed all along the way to isolate the corresponding contributions. This approach successfully led to a suite of lithospheric field models with unprecedented spatial resolution (SH degree 133 for the MF 7 model). Even though specific problems related to spectral leakage can arise (Sabaka and Olsen, 2006; Thébault et al., 2012), implying that all SH coefficients are not necessarily well resolved, these models clearly revealed striking regional correlations between magnetic anomalies and continental geological bodies at small spatial scales.|$|R

30|$|Planetary {{magnetic}} fields are often {{expressed in terms}} of a finite series of spherical harmonics (SH) to a maximum expansion degree. After ten years of the CHAMP mission, the most recent models describing the magnetic field of the lithosphere, such as the MF 7 model (an upgrade of Maus et al., 2008; [URL] expanded to SH degree 133, and the CHAOS- 4 model (an upgrade of Olsen et al., 2010 a) expanded to SH degree 100, agree reasonably well up to degree 85, thus providing a robust bound of about 470 km on the maximum horizontal spatial resolution. The geometrical attenuation with altitude and the prominence of external fields at satellite level are the two main factors limiting our ability to reach higher SH degrees and thus to detect smaller scale structures. However, for equivalent altitude datasets, the differences between MF 7 and CHAOS- 4 mainly lie in the way the different models deal with source <b>field</b> <b>separation</b> and, more specifically, with the rapidly time-varying external fields.|$|R

We propose the use of TR imaging {{in conjunction with a}} <b>field</b> <b>separation</b> method (FSM) in order to study the radiating sources of a Steelpan. The TR-FSM method consists in measuring the acoustic pressure on a double-layer hemispherical time reversal mirror (TRM). Outgoing waves are separated from ingoing waves by using spherical-harmonic expansions. The outgoing contribution is then time-reversed and numerically backpropagated, allowing to achieve accurate imaging of acoustically radiating sources. This FSM also allows to separate contributions from noise source outside the region of interest, thus separating the contributions from zones on the instrument. In this study, this imaging method is used for the imaging of radiating sources on a Steelpan played by a performer.
