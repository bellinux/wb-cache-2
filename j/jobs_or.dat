5|$|The trio {{explored}} {{the world around}} them, experiencing a second childhood with no wives, <b>jobs,</b> <b>or</b> responsibilities. They passed the time by speculating about their fellow townspeople and testing inventions. Regular subplots {{in the first decade}} of the show included: Sid and Ivy bickering over the management of the café, Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge having a secret love affair that everyone knows about, Wally trying to get away from Nora's watchful eye, Foggy's exaggerated war stories, and Compo's schemes to win the affections of Nora Batty.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev also {{proposed}} to restructure Soviet high schools. While {{the high schools}} provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would {{spend much of their}} time at factory <b>jobs</b> <b>or</b> in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools. In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.|$|E
5|$|Ohio's {{private sector}} is {{composed}} of 921,000 employers, which hire around 50.4% of Ohio's non-farm private workforce. Ohio has a developing technology sector and is home to over 28,000 employers that employ nearly 820,000 people; its rate of technology operations is 14% higher than the US average. Between 2006 and 2014, Ohio's employment {{is expected to grow}} by 290,700 <b>jobs,</b> <b>or</b> approximately 5.0%. Personal income grew an average of 3.1% in 2008. About 659,900 people are employed in Ohio's manufacturing sector. Major manufacturing employers include AK Steel, Timken, and Honda. In 2007, foreign-based companies employed 229,500 Ohioans, led by Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|The Governor acts on {{the advice}} of the islands' Executive Council, {{composed}} of the Chief Executive, the Director of Finance and three elected members of the Legislative Assembly (with the Governor as chairman). The Legislative Assembly, a unicameral legislature, consists of the Chief Executive, the Director of Finance and eight members (five from Stanley and three from Camp) elected to four-year terms by universal suffrage. All politicians in the Falkland Islands are independent; no political parties exist on the islands. Since the 2013 general election, members of the Legislative Assembly have received a salary and are expected to work full-time and give up all previously held <b>jobs</b> <b>or</b> business interests.|$|E
5|$|Upon its beginnings, {{the group}} {{attracted}} {{a variety of}} Puerto Rican independence supporters, {{including some of the}} members of the University Pro-Independence Federation of Puerto Rico (FUPI) and the Pro-Independence Movement. For the most part, individuals affiliated with the EPB are expected to merge into general society and be as inconspicuous as possible, usually holding civilian <b>jobs</b> <b>or</b> studying, some receiving training within the United States military. In 2006, professor Michael González Cruz published his book Nacionalismo Revolucionario Puertorriqueño a calculation that placed the active EPB members at approximately 5,700, with an additional unknown number of supporters, sympathizers, collaborators and informants throughout the U.S. and other countries. A report by The Economist estimated the number of active members to be around 1,100, excluding supporters.|$|E
5|$|The Outlaw Star manga {{series and}} {{animated}} television series are paced differently. The anime episodes often involve Gene and his comrades taking on various <b>jobs</b> <b>or</b> missions to fund their ship's massive maintenance costs. Throughout their travels, the crew often encounters Ronald MacDougall and Harry MacDougall, {{a pair of}} bounty hunters {{responsible for the death}} of Gene's father. Ronald acts as a rival to Gene, while Harry wishes to form a bond with Melfina, a bio-android like himself, who instead develops strong feelings for Gene. The crew also contends with others that learn of the Outlaw Star's connection to the Galactic Leyline. They are Nguyen Khan, a scientist wishing to gain omniscience through the Leyline; and Lord Hazanko, the leader of the ruthless assassin organization the Anten Seven that seek the Leyline to gain ultimate power. The series climaxes when all parties meet on the physical plane of the Leyline. In the end, Ron MacDougall retreats, saved by a computer copy of his brother Harry (who is killed trying to protect Melfina from Hazanko), Khan is integrated into the Leyline as data, Gene reveals to Melfina that he is in love with her and frees her from the Leyline by making it their shared wish to be together forever, and Hazanko is eventually defeated by the Outlaw Star crewmembers. Once the conflict comes to a close, Gene and his friends return to Sentinel III and go their separate ways, but ultimately reunite to continue their adventures together.|$|E

30|$|The major {{interest}} of the analysis is {{on the process of}} getting off social benefits by the young adults’ transitions into <b>job</b> <b>or</b> training. Labour market integration includes an entry into a new <b>job</b> <b>or</b> vocational training in firms. Considering that <b>job</b> <b>or</b> training entries can either lead to an increase in the household income to allow independence from social benefits or not, the analysis distinguishes between young adults who exit from benefits by labour market integration (A) or realise a partial exit from benefits by labour market integration (B) as they enter <b>job</b> <b>or</b> training positions where the earnings do not cover the needs of the household. The latter leads to reduced benefits receipt as the amount of the subsidy decreases with an additional income but benefit episodes last on. Furthermore, it is taken into account that trainees or employed beneficiaries on low incomes in the sample can get off benefits by transitions into a better labour market position maintaining sufficient earnings e.g. by <b>job</b> replacements <b>or</b> an increasing income (e.g. Gangl 1998).|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the company's deteriorating {{financial}} situation, Nakayama resigned as president of Sega in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri. Stolar would subsequently accede to president of Sega of America. Following five years of generally declining profits, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998 Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to a 54.8% decline in consumer product sales (including a 75.4% decline overseas), the company reported a net loss of ¥43.3 billion (US$327.8 million) and a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion (US$269.8 million). Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America, with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor. Only 12 Saturn games were released in North America in 1998 (Magic Knight Rayearth being the final official release), compared to 119 in 1996. The Saturn would last longer in Japan and Europe. Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega itself—were leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released. The Dreamcast was released on November 27, 1998 in Japan and on September 9, 1999 in North America. The decision to abandon the Saturn effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year. Sega suffered an additional ¥42.881 billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 1999, and the company announced plans to eliminate 1,000 <b>jobs,</b> <b>or</b> nearly one-fourth of its workforce.|$|E
