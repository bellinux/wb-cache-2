40|$|The {{surface of}} a single crystal Germanium wafer was {{transformed}} to crystals of germanium fluorides and oxides upon exposure to a vapor of HF and HNO 3 chemical mixture. Structure analysis indicate that the transformation results in a germanate polycrystalline layer consisting of germanium oxide and ammonium <b>fluogermanate</b> with a preferential crystal growth orientation in direction. Local vibrational mode analysis confirms the presence of N-H and Ge-F vibrational modes in addition to Ge-O stretching modes. Energy dispersive studies reveal the presence of hexagonal Î±-phase GeO 2 crystal clusters and ammonium fluogermanates around these clusters {{in addition to a}} surface oxide layer. Electronic band structure as probed by ellipsometry has been associated with the germanium oxide crystals and disorder induced band tailing effects at the interface of the germanate layer and the bulk Ge wafer. The acid vapor exposure causes Ge surface to emit a yellow photoluminescence at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{surface of}} a single crystal Germanium wafer was {{transformed}} to fluoride and oxide crystals upon exposure to a vapor of HF and HNO 3 chemical mixture. Ellipsometry. X-ray, SEM and photoluminescence were used to investigate the physical properties of the resultant surface structure The analysis indicates that the transformation results in a polycrystalline hexagonal ammonium <b>fluogermanates</b> and a hexagonal alpha-Germanium oxide Clusters with a preferential crystal growth orientation in direction The <b>fluogermanates</b> grow particularly around the germanium oxide Clusters as evidenced by electron dispersive spectroscopy profiling Local vibrational mode analysis confirm the presence of N-H and Ge-F vibrational modes of NH 4 + and GeF 6 - ions. The vibrational modes at around 840 cm(- 1) is significative of GeOx stretching bands originating from the partial coverage surface oxide formed together with the <b>fluogermanates</b> and clusters oil the Germanium Electronic band structure as probed by ellipsometry is typical of Ge and any discrepancy was associated with disorder induced band tailing effects originating possibly from the effect of oxide clustering...|$|R
