It is shown {{how to build a}} bridge between RGT and emotions. For this purpose the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) model is adopted. The major ad-vantages of RGT are its ability to predict human behavior and unfold the entire spectra of reflexion in the human mind. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>PAD</b> provides ultimate approach to model emotions. It is illustrated that emotions are reflexive processes and, consequently, RGT fused with PAD model is natural solution to model emotional interactions between peo-ple. The fusion of RGT and PAD, called Emotional Reflexive Games (ERG), inherits the key features of both components. Using ERG, we show how reflexive control can be successfully applied to model human emotional states. Up to date, EGR is a unique methodology capable of modeling human reflexive processes and emotional aspects simultane-ously...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) was studied in 280 (203 males, 77 females) patients with different types of primary hyperlipoproteinemia. In primary hyperbetalipoproteinemia the {{prevalence of}} CAD (45 % for Type IIa and 47 % for Type IIb) is significatly higher than that in the other types of hyperlipoproteinemia (38 % for Type IV and 17 % for Type V). On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>PAD</b> prevalence is much higher in hypertriglyceridemia (21 % in Type IIb and 20 % in Type V) than in hypercholesterolemia alone (9 % in Type IIa). These results suggest ths atherosclerotic complications are concerned. Moreover, the high frequency of PAD found in hypertriglyceridemia {{can be related to}} the high occurrence of diabetes in these patients. The effects of other major risk factors of atherosclerosis (smoking and hypertension) were also evaluated. Our results indicate that the association of hypercholestolemia and hypertension is more dangerous than the co-occurence of hypercholesterolemia and smokin...|$|E
40|$|Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) is a {{necessary}} step in semi conductor manufacturing. Since its introduction it {{has been able to}} provide better local and global planarization. CMP has found applications in emerging technologies such as shallow trench isolation, damascene technologies. As device size shrinks CMP has become increasingly prominent. CMP process has been analyzed at different length scales such as particle, feature and wafer scales. Models have been developed for each scale. The models initially have been deterministic, accounting for material removal by a single isolated particle. These models predicted the quality control parameters such as material removal rate and planarization at global scales. Recently, probabilistic models have been developed to describe material removal rate from particle scale. However there do not exist models which capture the interaction between parameters at different length scales. The focus of this thesis is to develop a multi-scale model that considers the interaction between parameters at different length scales. The interaction between macro-scale property pH of the slurry on the micro-scale phenomenon such as particle agglomeration has been studied. Interaction between pad asperity distribution and particle diameter distribution has also been studied. In the existing probabilistic models the effect of asperities on the material removal has been studied assuming that the pad asperities are supported on a rigid base. In this thesis the pad cellular structure under the asperities is considered to predict scratch performance and material removal rate. The effect of pad structure and slurry pH on scratch propensity and wafer scale material removal rate is studied. The model prediction of material removal rate has been validated against experimental data. The predicted linear dependence of material removal rate on pressure has been verified. The underlying cellular structure of the pad has been found to have little impact on the dependence of material removal rate on pressure. Defectivity, as defined by scratch propensity has been studied in this thesis. Scratch performance {{has been found to be}} effected mainly by the proximity of slurry pH to the isoelectric point of the slurry particles. The scratch performance has worsened as the pH of the slurry becomes closer to the isoelectric point of particles. A parametric study has been undertaken to study the effect of pad and slurry evolution on scratch propensity and material removal rate. Based on the study, suggestions have been made to improve scratch performance and material removal rate. Aggressive pad conditioning has been found to improve scratch propensity while it also has been found to maintain material removal rate, which decreases if the pad is allowed to evolve. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>pad</b> evolution has been found to alleviate scratch problem. Based on the insights gained in the parametric study, few suggestions about operating conditions have been made. It has been suggested to keep the slurry pH away from the isoelectric point of particles to alleviate scratch propensity. It is suggested that the pad be conditioned when the wafer surface is away from the target profile and the pad be allowed to evolve when the wafer surface is closer to target profile. This strategy maintains the material removal rate during the beginning of the process while avoiding the killer defects towards the end of the process...|$|E

50|$|The {{final stage}} of the carving process is {{polishing}}. Sandpaper {{can be used as}} a first step in the polishing process, or sand cloth. Emery, a stone that is harder and rougher than the sculpture media, is also used in the finishing process. This abrading, or wearing away, brings out the color of the stone, reveals patterns in the surface and adds a sheen. Tin and iron oxides are often used to give the stone a highly reflective exterior. Today, modern stone sculptors use diamond abrasives to sand in the final finishing processes. This can be achieved by <b>hand</b> <b>pads</b> in rough to fine abrasives ranging from 36 grit to 3000 grit. Also diamond pads mounted on water cooled rotary air or electric sanders speed the finishing process.|$|R

50|$|The gravi-kora {{is set up}} tonally {{just like}} {{traditional}} koras. It has 21 strings, 11 on left hand, and 10 on right hand side. The instrument is held by hooking the smallest fingers around the long handles which are positioned below the straight sided bridge. The hand placement is above these handles which enables easy string muting while playing with the <b>hand</b> <b>pads.</b> But the range of notes {{is not the same}} {{on both sides of the}} bridge. The left side is shifted more to the bass register starting with a cluster of the four lowest notes together. The right side is skewed more to the treble, ending with a cluster of the three highest notes on the right side. This is reflected in the way the holes for the strings are drilled in the neck, and the length and weight of strings used. This results in a unique asymmetric layout of tones where most of the strings directly opposite each other in the middle section of the bridge are tuned in octaves except for the bass cluster in the left hand and the treble cluster in the right. This is a standard popular kora tuning.|$|R

30|$|The {{amounts of}} P {{desorbed}} by the Fe strips (Fe–P) showed {{an inverse relationship}} with Pads estimated by Langmuir equation for the soil before leaching (Table  8). Analyzing this apparent discrepancy, one should remember that Fe–P was experimentally determined, with the P desorbing directly from soil onto the Fe strips. Furthermore, Fe–P maintained correlation with the values of water soluble P in a 1 : 10 (m/v) ratio (Table  7, WEP initial and Qin). On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>Pads</b> estimated by Langmuir was calculated by adjusting the equation to the experimental data, and the parameters of this equation, especially KL, showed considerable uncertainty (Table  7). Furthermore, Pads estimated by Langmuir {{was derived from the}} difference between P added to an aqueous suspension and P found in the solution after 24  h of stirring. Thus, by inference, there is no reversibility in this phenomenon. It was found that, as the adsorption capacity of the solid phase increased, the resistance of Pads to return to the solution also increased (Tiessen et al. 1993). Therefore, although the amounts of Pads by Langmuir estimated the added P with reasonable approximation, {{it is not possible to}} draw conclusions as to the availability of this form of P for the plants.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Lack {{of sensory}} {{feedback}} is a drawback in today’s hand prostheses. We present here a non-invasive simple sensory feedback system, which provides the user of a pros-thetic hand with sensory {{feedback on the}} arm stump. It is mediated by air in a closed loop system connecting silicone pads on the prosthetic <b>hand</b> with <b>pads</b> on the amputation stump. The silicone pads in a “tactile display ” on the ampu-tation stump expand when their corresponding sensor-bulb in the prosthesis is touched, evoking an experience of “real touch”. Methods: Twelve trans-radial amputees and 20 healthy non-amputees participated in the study. We investigated {{the capacity of the}} system to mediate detection of touch, dis-crimination between different levels of pressure and, on the amputees also, the ability to locate touch. Results: The results showed a median touch threshold of 80 and 60 g in amputees and non-amputees, respectively, and 90 % and 80 % correct answers, respectively, in discrimi-nation between 2 levels of pressure. The amputees located touch (3 sites) correctly in 96 % of trials. Conclusion: This simple sensory feedback system has the potential to restore sensory feedback in hand amputees and thus it could be a useful tool to enhance prosthesis use.
