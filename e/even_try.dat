Some queens could <b>even</b> <b>try</b> {{to return to their}} nests that they came from after nuptial flight, but end in another nest, in association that nests nearby will be similar to the queens birth nest.|$|E

25|$|Food {{problems}} {{may be the}} cause of an observed failure of the birds to <b>even</b> <b>try</b> to breed. The results of the research suggest this is related to a decline in sardines (Sardinops sagax), {{an important part of the}} boobies’ diet. Earlier work on Española Island saw successful breeding in blue-footed boobies that have access to sardines, in which case their diet consists essentially wholly of sardines. However, sardines have been largely absent from the Española area since 1997, as has been shown from Nazca boobies there, who also prefer sardines but can breed using other prey. In 2012–13, roughly only half of prey items in the boobies' diet were sardines. No evidence was seen of other possible causes for the decline, such as effects of humans, introduced predators, or disease.|$|E

25|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} attention blindness: humans perceive {{only a fraction of}} everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of Now You See It, Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t <b>even</b> <b>try</b> to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.|$|E

500|$|Sackville Street {{was renamed}} O'Connell Street in 1924. [...] The {{following}} year the Dublin Metropolitan Police and the Dublin Civic Survey [...] demanded legislation {{to allow the}} Pillar's removal, without success. [...] Pressure continued, and in 1926 The Manchester Guardian reported that the Pillar was to be taken down, [...] "as it was a hindrance to modern traffic". Requests for action—removal, destruction or {{the replacement of the}} statue with that of an Irish hero—continued up to the Second World War and beyond; the main stumbling blocks remained the trustees' strict interpretation of the terms of the trust, and the unwillingness of successive Irish governments to take legislative action. [...] In 1936 the magazine of the ultra-nationalist Blueshirts movement remarked that this inactivity showed a failure in the national spirit: [...] "The conqueror is gone, but the scars which he left remain, and the victim will not <b>even</b> <b>try</b> to remove them".|$|E
500|$|Brezhnev {{conspired to}} oust Podgorny {{as early as}} 1970. The reason was simple: Brezhnev was third, while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet {{diplomatic}} protocol. Since September 1970 Brezhnev tried to form an opposition in the Politburo to oust Podgorny. According to Time, [...] "There was some speculation in Moscow" [...] that if Brezhnev didn't succeed in removing Podgorny he would establish a Council of State modelled after institutions found in, for example, East Germany (Staatsrat), People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Socialist Republic of Romania. The post of Chairman of the Council of State would give Brezhnev the top state and party job in the USSR. Brezhnev's backers were unable, and didn't <b>even</b> <b>try,</b> to remove Podgorny {{from the head of}} state post at the 1970 Central Committee plenum. Brezhnev could count on only five votes, while another seven Politburo members were opposed to granting Brezhnev more power; removing Podgorny would in fact mean the end of the collective leadership.|$|E

500|$|Devil's Due {{released}} three-issue mini-series Halloween: The First Death of Laurie Strode in late 2008. Written by Hutchinson with artwork from Jeff Zornow, {{the story}} bridges {{the gap between}} Halloween II and Halloween H20 by focusing on Laurie Strode {{in the aftermath of}} the 1978 murders. Hutchinson explains that Laurie is [...] "trying to get better and trying to repair, but where do you even start after going through such horror? How do you <b>even</b> <b>try</b> to resume normality when you don't know what that is anymore?" [...] Although Michael appears in the series, it is not clear whether he is real or if the traumatised Laurie is seeing things. Hutchinson is not a fan of the revelation that Laurie and Michael are siblings and took steps to address that problem in the story. He wanted to avoid the [...] "bloodline plot of the middle sequels", which he felt demystified the character of the Shape, and approach the story so that [...] "it becomes almost incidental that she's his sister". Hutchinson believed that Laurie Strode's evolution into Keri Tate was fertile ground for a storyline; he says, [...] "it's not the faking of the death that's interesting at all, but it’s the fall that leads to that happening. The faked death is just simple mechanics and can be covered in a sentence, but the state of mind and events leading to that are full of rich character and dramatic potential." ...|$|E
500|$|Gibson {{said she}} took a moment before agreeing, as she had just wrapped up work on Gaga's Monster Ball HBO special {{but she could not}} resist in the end. [...] "It's a phenomenal video: really powerful, really impactful. She's such a strong, {{committed}} artist. Her loyalty to me is something I will be forever grateful for. We're spiritually connected. We need each other ... and 'Judas' is ultimately a representation of our true bond," [...] she added. With The Hollywood Reporter, Gibson explained that within the video they created a new Jerusalem. The shock value in the video was purposefully added, but ultimately the story was about oppression; and about following one's heart and the glory of being free. With NME magazine Gaga revealed that the video involved motorbikes and a death sequence. She also described the portrayal of her character as being [...] "beyond repentance", which evolved from the continuous media accusations towards her that [...] " [...] trashy. or pretentious or this and that. [...] is my way of saying 'I've crossed the line, I won't <b>even</b> <b>try</b> to repent. Nor should I'." [...] Forgiveness and destiny also played a part in the video, and Gaga wanted to portray a Federico Fellini-esque story with apostles being revolutionaries in a modern-day Jerusalem. They are led to Jesus, by Gaga as Magdalene. Although initially reported to be premiered during an episode of the tenth season of American Idol, the music video premiered on May 5, 2011, on E! News at 7 pm.|$|E

The consensus today on the review site Rotten Tomatoes is that although the [...] "biopic is undeniably stylish", it [...] "loses points for excessive length, an overreliance on clichés, and historical inaccuracies", and has a 65% fresh rating. Emily W. Leider claims the film to be [...] "more remarkable for its [...] "legs and tinsel" [...] extravagance than for its excellence." [...] David Parkinson of Empire magazine gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and concluded that it [...] "Drags in places and doesn't <b>even</b> <b>try</b> for a true-to-life portrait of the great theatre entrepreneur but it's shiny and big spectacle with impressive choreography." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader called it [...] "amazingly dull, even with William Powell in the lead and guest appearances by the likes of Ray Bolger and Fanny Brice." [...] Emanuel Levy gave it a C grade and stated that it was [...] "overlong and overblown but ultimately mediocre as a musical movie and as a biopic of the legendary showman." [...] James Berardinelli awarded it 2.5 out of 4 stars and stated that [...] "although some of the production's technical aspects remain impressive, the dramatic elements come across as trite and many of the musical numbers are dated", but said that it was a [...] "reasonably competent – albeit [...] "airbrushed" [...] – presentation of the main character's life." ...|$|E
