With the same <b>grid</b> <b>number</b> t and <b>n,</b> the same farthest distance between two neighbor grids R, the new scheme's coverage is 0. 5988 larger, and the Pl {{is higher than}} Du's method. Also, our method can perform better when {{the same number of}} nodes has been compromised. Furthermore, we make use of the hexagon scheme as well as the bivariate scheme and propose a new and improved scheme.

This exibility allows to achieve a running time that compares favourably with those of existing procedures. 1 Introduction and Main Results In this paper we present a basic theorem in combinatorial geometry and discuss its application to the well known problem of computing a geometric disk covering [1]. The theorem states as follows: Theorem 1 Consider a square lattice where the distance between two neighboring lattice vertices is one. Call a disk of xed radius r, centered at a lattice vertex, a <b>grid</b> disk. The <b>number</b> <b>N</b> of <b>grid</b> disks that are necessary and sucient to cover any disk of radius r placed on the plane, is given by: CASE 1. For r < p 2 2, N does not exist. CASE 2.

40|$|For the {{analysis}} of orthogonal grids a modified iterative method is developed here to analyse interconnected grids. The method is similar to Kani’s method and it helps to perform {{the analysis}} in only one set of operation. This {{is in contrast to}} moment-torque distribution method or rotation contribution method in which 2 n+ 2 sets of operations are required for {{the analysis of}} a <b>grid</b> having <b>n</b> <b>number</b> of internal joints. This method is a modified form of Kani’s method, which is generally employed for the analysis of multi storied frame. It makes use of the slope-deflection equation for expressing the flexural rotations in terms of bending moments and also gyration equation relating the angle of twist and torsion. In the proposed method, displacement contribution corresponding to 6 EIδ/L 2 is taken into account. Equations are developed to calculate the rotation contribution both in East-West direction and in North-South direction in terms of far end rotation contribution. The equilibrium of each joint in vertical direction yields the governing equation for displacement contribution of each member connected to joint in terms of rotation contribution, fixed end reaction and other displacement contribution. The proposed method is capable of analysing <b>grids</b> with any <b>number</b> of internal joints.

40|$|The void {{fraction}} of computational cells in numerical simulations of particulate flows using computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) is often directly (or crudely) calculated {{assuming that the}} entire body of a particle lies in the cell at which the particle centroid resides. This direct method is most inexpensive but inaccurate and may lead to simulation instabilities. In this study, {{a modified version of}} the direct method has been proposed. In this method, referred to as the particle meshing method (PMM), the particle is meshed and the solid volume in a fluid cell is calculated by adding up the particle mesh volume with the basic working principle being the same as that of the direct method. As a result, the PMM inherits the simplicity and hence the computational advantage from the direct method, whilst allowing for duplicating the particle shape and accurate accounting of particle volume in each fluid cell. The numerical simulation characteristics of PMM including numerical stability, minimum particle <b>grid</b> <b>number,</b> prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency have been examined. The results showed that for a specific cell-to-particle size ratio, there was a minimum particle <b>grid</b> <b>number</b> required to reach the stable simulation. A formula of estimating the minimum particle <b>grid</b> <b>number</b> was derived and discussed. Typically, a particle <b>grid</b> <b>number</b> of about 5 times the minimum number was suggested to achieve the best computational efficiency, which was comparable or even higher than that of simulations using the analytical approach.
