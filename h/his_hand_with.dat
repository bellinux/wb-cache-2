25|$|Bernini did {{not build}} many churches from scratch; rather, his efforts were {{concentrated}} on pre-existing structures, {{such as the}} restored church of Santa Bibbiana and in particular St. Peter's. He fulfilled three commissions for new churches in Rome and nearby small towns. Best known is the small but richly ornamented oval church of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale, done (beginning in 1658) for the Jesuit novitiate, representing {{one of the rare}} works of <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> which Bernini's son, Domenico, reports that his father was truly and very pleased. Bernini also designed churches in Castelgandolfo (San Tommaso da Villanova, 1658–61) and Ariccia (Santa Maria Assunta, 1662–64).|$|E
25|$|Since Dyson {{was being}} tackled by the legs, {{there was still}} the {{possibility}} he could reach towards the end zone and get the ball across the goal line. Both players went into a rolling motion as Dyson outstretched <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> the football towards the goal line {{in the hopes of}} scoring the touchdown. Though his reach was close, and the ball mere inches away from the end zone, it was still not enough to score. As the rolling motion came to an end, with Jones now on top of Dyson's legs, his shoulder had touched the ground and, therefore, the game was over. Had Dyson scored and the extra point been converted, {{it would have been the}} first Super Bowl ever to go into overtime. Alternatively, had Dyson scored, the Titans could have attempted a 2-point conversion for the outright win.|$|E

500|$|By November 1989, the {{estimated}} cost of the overall {{savings and loan crisis}} had reached $500 billion, and the media's coverage often highlighted Keating's role as part of what became a feeding frenzy. Keating and Lincoln Savings became convenient symbols for arguments about what had gone wrong in America's financial system and society, as well as for 1980s greed in general, and were featured in popular culture references. A deck of playing cards would be marketed, called [...] "The Savings and Loan Scandal", that featured on their face Charles Keating holding up <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>with</b> images of the Keating Five senators portrayed as puppets on his fingers.|$|E
500|$|In late 1831, Greeley went to New York City to seek his fortune.

[...] In 1833, he tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> Horatio D. Sheppard at editing a daily newspaper, the New York Morning Post, which was not a success. [...] Despite this failure and its attendant financial loss, Greeley published the thrice-weekly Constitutionalist, which mostly printed lottery results.|$|E
500|$|Keating and Lincoln Savings became {{convenient}} symbols for {{arguments about}} what had gone wrong in America's financial system and society, and were featured in popular culture references.

By spring 1992, a deck of playing cards was being marketed, called [...] "The Savings and Loan Scandal", that featured on their face Charles Keating holding up <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>with</b> images of the five senators portrayed as puppets on his fingers. Polls showed that most Americans believed {{the actions of the}} Keating Five were typical of Congress as a whole. Political historian Lewis Gould would later echo this sentiment, as well as Cranston attorney Dershowitz's argument, writing that, [...] "the real problem for the 'Keating Three' who were most involved was that they had been caught." ...|$|E

500|$|French art {{historian}} Françoise Cachin notes that Gauguin designed both Self-Portrait with Halo and Snake and its companion piece Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan [...] as a caricature. In his Self-Portrat, Gauguin appears against a red background with a halo {{above his head}} and apples hanging beside him as he holds a snake in <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> {{what appear to be}} either plants or flowers in the foreground. [...] Curator Philip Conisbee observes the religious symbolism in the images, noting that the [...] "apples and snake refer to the Garden of Eden, temptation, sin, and the Fall of Man." [...] Gauguin divides the canvas in half, painting himself as both saint and sinner, reflecting his own personal myth as an artist. In the top portion of the painting, Gauguin is almost angelic with the halo, looking away from the apples of temptation. [...] In the bottom portion, he holds the snake, completing the duality.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Feldman {{reworked}} {{his ideas}} into a spec script. This {{was sent to}} producer Frank Mancuso, Jr., who had hired Feldman to adapt Sidney Kirkpatrick's A Cast of Killers. The producer got attracted to the creative possibilites as the film offered [...] "the challenge of walking that fine line between believability and pushing something {{as far as it}} can go." [...] Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer got interested on the project, and while Feldman had some initial disagreements on the budget, after considering other studios he signed with MGM. [...] In turn, the now retitled Species attracted director Roger Donaldson, who was attracted to its blend of science fiction and thriller. The script underwent eight different drafts, written over an eight-month period, before Donaldson was content that flaws in the story's logic had been corrected. At one point another writer, Larry Gross, tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> the script, but ultimately all the work was done by Feldman. Feldman would remain as a co-producer. While the initial Species script suggested a love triangle between Sil and two government team members, the dissatisfaction of the crew eventually led to changes to the ending, which ended up featuring Sil having a baby that would immediately prove dangerous.|$|E

2500|$|Like Spearhafoc, Mannig's biography, {{with some}} precise details, {{is given in}} the chronicle {{maintained}} by his abbey.

Spearhafoc and Mannig are the [...] "only two goldsmiths of whom we have extended accounts", and the additional information given about Godric, the leader of a team brought in by Mannig for the shrine, is also unique among the surviving evidence. [...] Some twenty years after the miracle, he joined the Abbey of Evesham, presumably in retirement, and his son later became Prior there.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1999 Marinovich {{was cleared}} to reenter the NFL, but {{suffered}} a herniated disk playing recreational basketball.

2500|$|His father, George Clayton Tennyson (1778–1831), was rector of Somersby (1807–1831), also rector of Benniworth (1802–1831) and Bag Enderby, and vicar of Grimsby (1815). Rev. George Clayton Tennyson {{raised a}} large family and [...] "was a man of {{superior}} abilities and varied attainments, who tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> fair success in architecture, painting, music, and poetry. He was comfortably well off for a country clergyman and his shrewd money management enabled the family to spend summers at Mablethorpe and Skegness on the eastern coast of England".

2500|$|Danny writes [...] "REDRUM" [...] on {{the outside}} of the {{bathroom}} door in the family's living quarters. When Wendy sees the word reversed in the bedroom mirror, the word is revealed to be [...] "MURDER". Jack begins hacking through the quarters' main door with a firefighter's axe. Wendy sends Danny through the bathroom window, but it will not open sufficiently for her to pass. Jack breaks through the bathroom door, shouting [...] "Here's Johnny!", but retreats after Wendy slashes <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> a butcher's knife. Hearing Hallorann arriving in a snowcat he borrowed, Jack leaves the room. He murders Hallorann with the axe in the lobby and pursues Danny into the hedge maze. Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering ghosts and the cascade of blood Danny envisioned in Boulder. She also finds Hallorann's corpse in the lobby. Danny lays a false trail to mislead Jack, who is following his footprints, before hiding behind a drift. Danny escapes from the maze and reunites with Wendy; they escape in Hallorann's snowcat, while Jack freezes to death in the snow. In an old photograph in the hotel hallway dated July 4, 1921, Jack Torrance smiles front and center amid a crowd of party revelers at the Overlook.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Project Reborn", Tommy {{learns that}} in order for him and Malina to stop the H.E.L.E., they need a third person to act as a conduit for their power, someone willing to {{sacrifice}} themselves to save the world. Tommy goes back in time two days and saves Noah's life, transporting him seven years into the past to when Angela tested the twins powers. Noah watches as Angela states that there was a third faceless person in her vision and seems to look right at Noah. Tommy explains to Noah that after failing to stop the H.E.L.E. [...] "a thousand times", he realized Noah was the key: if Noah acts as their conduit, they can stop it, but it will be fatal to him. Noah tells Tommy {{to take him to the}} present where he takes Malina's hand. Though Tommy protests, Noah tells him that this is his destiny and Tommy takes <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>With</b> the power boost from Tommy, Malina fires a blast of energy into the sky through Noah, causing him great pain but successfully shielding the planet from the H.E.L.E. and saving the world. After the future is changed, Tommy and Malina find Noah sitting on the ground, near death. Noah looks at his grandchildren one last time and tells them that he's proud of them before dying.|$|E
2500|$|The Anonymous Conqueror wrote, They {{lead him}} to the temple, where they dance and carry on joyously, and the man about to be {{sacrifice}}d dances and carries on like the rest. At length the man who offers the sacrifice strips him naked, and leads him at once to the stairway of the tower where is the stone idol. Here they stretch him on his back, tying the hands to the sides and fastening the legs ... Soon comes the sacrificing priest--and this is no small office among them--armed with a stone knife, which cuts like steel, and {{is as big as}} one of our large knives. He plunges the knife into the breast, opens it, and tears out the heart hot and palpitating. And this as quickly as one might cross himself. At this point the chief priest of the temple takes it, and anoints the mouth of the principal idol with the blood; then filling <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> it he flings it towards the sun, or towards some star, if it be night. Then he anoints the mouths of all the other idols of wood and stone, and sprinkles blood on the cornice of the chapel of the principal idol. Afterwards they burn the heart, preserving the ashes as a great relic, and likewise they burn the body of the sacrifice, but these ashes are kept apart from those of the heart in a different vase.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 October 1766, Sophia Magdalena {{was married}} to Gustav by proxy at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen with her brother Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark as {{representative}} of her groom. She traveled in the royal golden sloop from Kronborg in Denmark over Öresund to Hälsingborg in Sweden; when she was halfway, the Danish cannon salute ended, and the Swedish started to fire. In Helsingborg, she was welcomed by her brother-in-law Prince Charles of Hesse, who had crossed the sea shortly before her, the Danish envoy in Stockholm, Baron Schack, as well as Crown Prince Gustav. As {{she was about to}} set foot on ground, Gustav was afraid that she would fall, and he therefore reached her <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> the words: [...] "Watch out, Madame!", a reply which quickly became a topic of gossip at the Swedish court. The couple then traveled by land toward Stockholm, being celebrated on the way. She met her father-in-law the King and her brothers-in-law at Stäket Manor on 27 October, and she continued to be well-treated and liked by them all during her life in Sweden. Thereafter, she met her mother-in-law the Queen and her sister-in-law at Säby Manor, and on the 28th, she was formally presented for the Swedish royal court at Drottningholm Palace. At this occasion, Countess Ebba Bonde noted that the impression about her was: [...] "By God, how beautiful she is!", but that her appearance was affected by {{the fact that she had}} a: [...] "terrible fear of the Queen". The 4 November 1766, she was officially welcomed to the capital of Stockholm, were the she {{was married to}} Gustav in person in the Royal Chapel at Stockholm Royal Palace.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Foley {{signed a}} {{contract}} with WWF and, this time, the WWF did not use Foley as [...] "enhancement talent". He was shown several designs for a new character—a man with a leather mask and chains. However, WWF said that it was too dark and only left the mask. Foley arrived in the WWF in 1996 with a new gimmick and perhaps his most famous personality: Mankind, a mentally deranged schizophrenic who constantly squealed (even throughout his matches), shrieked [...] "Mommy!", spoke to a rat named George, enjoyed pain, physically abused himself (such as by pulling out his hair), wore a mask and lived in boiler rooms; hence, his specialty match, the Boiler Room Brawl. Mankind's finishing move was the mandible claw nerve hold, which involved sticking his fingers in his opponent's mouth. Later in his career, Mankind began covering <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> a dirty, smelly sock before applying the maneuver. His catch phrase was [...] "Have a nice day". The original name that Vince McMahon had for Foley was [...] "Mason the Mutilator", but Foley thought that Mankind would be a better name and McMahon changed it. On the April 1, 1996 edition of Raw is War, the day after WrestleMania XII, Mankind debuted and defeated Bob Holly, quickly moving into a feud with The Undertaker. The two then began interfering in the other's matches until they were booked in the first ever Boiler Room brawl, in which the goal was to escape the arena's boiler room and reach the ring to take the urn from Paul Bearer. The Undertaker appeared to have won, but Paul Bearer refused to hand him the urn, allowing Mankind to win, thus (for the time being) ending the relationship between Paul and The Undertaker. While Mankind was managed by Paul Bearer, he referred to him as [...] "Uncle Paul". Mankind then earned the number one contendership to face the then WWF Champion Shawn Michaels at [...] Michaels won by disqualification via interference by Vader and The Undertaker. For several years, Foley considered this match his best ever, saying: [...] "Sure, at 280 pounds I still looked like hell, but after a brutal cardiovascular training regimen, I was able to go full-tilt for twenty-seven minutes with a smaller, quicker, better athlete than me". Foley would later state he preferred his match with Randy Orton at Backlash 2004.|$|E

Hook walks Emma home and at the door to the loft they share a kiss after Emma jokingly invites him in for coffee with her parents. During the kiss Hook notices his left hand again acting aggressively. Emma walks inside and has a moment when she seems to realize Hook's hand's actions and has a brief conversation with her parents. Hook runs into a drunk Will Scarlet trying to break into the library and punches him in the face when Will refuses to stop. Hook again is put off by his hand controlling his actions and tells Will that if he informs anyone of what happened he will be a dead man. As Mr. Gold is preparing to go home in his car with flowers Hook enters the passenger door and tells Mr. Gold to replace <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> the hook. He refuses, saying Hook should've heeded his warnings. Hook threatens to inform Belle (Emilie de Ravin) of the dagger, but Gold then tells Hook that he has swapped the daggers and that Belle has the actual dagger. Mr. Gold says he will replace the Hook once Hook does a favor for him. He refuses to give Hook a definite date or time and Hook states he {{can find a way to}} remove it without magic. Mr. Gold tells Hook that since his magic restored the hand, only his magic can take it off. Enraged, Hook thrusts the hook into Gold's chest. Mr. Gold is unharmed, stating he would have thought Hook would have learned the first time he tried to kill Rumplestiltskin. Hook states that it wasn't him that did that, and Mr. Gold states that the next time he may harm someone else who he cares about.
