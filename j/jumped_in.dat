The Wrights filed a lawsuit, beginning a years-long legal conflict. They also sued foreign aviators who flew at U.S. exhibitions, including the leading French aviator Louis Paulhan.

On the next play, Virginia Tech defender Eric Green <b>jumped</b> <b>in</b> {{front of an}} errant Rix pass and intercepted it.

5|$|Kerry {{bounced back}} in the 200m {{backstroke}} and won his heat to qualify third-fastest, before claiming bronze {{in a time of}} 2m 3.14s behind the Hungarian duo of Sándor Wladár and Zoltán Verrasztó. He edged out the Soviet Union's Vladimir Shemetov by 0.34s, becoming the first Australian to win a medal in an individual backstroke event since David Theile in 1960. In the 4200m freestyle relay, he combined with Tonelli, Graeme Brewer and Ron McKeon as Australia came seventh after qualifying fourth. The Australians were sixth at the halfway point when Kerry <b>jumped</b> <b>in</b> for the third leg. Kerry moved Australia into fifth {{by the end of his}} leg, just 0.78s from the bronze medal position, after posting a split time of 1m 52.64s, the 18th fastest split in the race. However, McKeon could not keep pace with the opposition anchor swimmers, and Australia finished seventh, 1.52s outside the medals.|$|E
5|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 9 orbiter obtained spectroscopic evidence of lightning on Venus, and the Venera 12 descent probe obtained additional evidence of lightning and thunder. The European Space Agency's Venus Express in 2007 detected whistler waves further confirming {{the occurrence of}} lightning on Venus. One possibility is that ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another piece of evidence comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which dropped {{by a factor of}} 10 between 1978 and 1986, <b>jumped</b> <b>in</b> 2006, and again declined 10-fold. This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.|$|E

The Hokies picked up a first down, but then NC State safety Michael Brooks <b>jumped</b> <b>in</b> front of a Virginia Tech pass, intercepting it at the 50-yard line. With 13:05 remaining in the quarter, NC State had its first offensive possession of {{the second quarter}}. The Wolfpack picked up several first downs, driving within the Virginia Tech 25-yard line for their furthest offensive penetration of the game. After being stopped for no or little gain on consecutive plays, NC State quarterback Erik Kramer completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Nasrallah Worthen. The score and extra point gave NC State its first lead of the game, 1410, with 8:55 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{returned}} Indiana's post-score kickoff to the 22-yard line, {{where the}} Hokie offense returned to action. Tech picked up nine yards on a pass from DeShazo, but two plays later, DeShazo threw his first interception {{of the game}} as Indiana's Mose Richardson <b>jumped</b> <b>in</b> front of a Tech pass. Following the turnover, Indiana's offense began work from the Virginia Tech 31-yard line. The Hoosiers picked up a first down rushing the ball, but a holding call on first down pushed Indiana away from the end zone. Following the penalty, Virginia Tech's defense prevented the Hoosiers gaining another first down, and IU was forced to attempt another field goal. As before, Manopolous' kick—this one a 40-yard attempt—was good, and Indiana sliced Tech's lead to a single point, 1413, with 5:25 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Melish {{had been}} fielding {{inquiries}} from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received back only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly <b>jumped</b> <b>in</b> price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{beat the}} Yankees in the {{eleventh}} {{game of the}} season. It {{was the first of}} three road games the Browns were scheduled to play in a span of eight days. The Browns opened the scoring early in the first quarter with a screen pass from Graham to Motley, who ran 78 yards for a touchdown. An interception by Parseghian on the Yankees' next possession set up another Browns touchdown, a one-yard run by Edgar Jones. The Yankees responded with two touchdowns of their own in the second quarter. The first was a long pass from Pete Layden to Bruce Alford early in the period. On Cleveland's next possession, Graham threw a pass to John Yonakor, but as Yonakor was waiting for the ball to arrive, New York's Otto Schnellbacher <b>jumped</b> <b>in</b> front of him and made an interception. Schnellbacher had a clear shot at Cleveland's end zone and ran it in for a touchdown that tied the game at 14 points. An interception by Yonakor later in the quarter set up a Groza field goal, and the Browns pulled away as halfback Bob Cowan ran for a touchdown and Groza added another field goal before halftime. Another touchdown by Motley in the third quarter put the Browns ahead by 20 points. The Yankees scored a final touchdown in the fourth quarter to cap a 45-yard drive, but the Browns won the game 34–21. Lavelli was hit in the eye early in the game and had to sit out. Tackle Chubby Grigg and Edgar Jones were also hurt in the game, adding to Cleveland's long list of injured players.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{high-frequency}} propagation of shocks across international equity markets. We identify shocks to stock prices, liquidity (quoted and effective spreads), and trading activity (turnover and order imbalance) for 12 equity markets {{around the world}} based on non-parametric jump statistics at the 5 -minute frequency from 1996 to 2011. <b>Jumps</b> <b>in</b> prices, quoted spreads, and order imbalance are prevalent and large, while <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> effective spreads and turnover are rare. Within a market, <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> prices are regularly accompanied by <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> order imbalance, but are independent of <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> liquidity. <b>Jumps</b> <b>in</b> prices and co-jumps in prices and order imbalance are primarily driven by information rather than liquidity, {{since there is no}} subsequent price reversal and since they often occur around U. S. macroeconomic news announcements. We also present evidence that <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> prices and order imbalance (but not liquidity) spillover across markets within the same 5 -minute interval. Overall, we find that order imbalances help explain why shocks to stock prices occur and spread across markets, while shocks to liquidity tend to be isolated events...|$|R

40|$|There are two central {{issues in}} option pricing: {{selecting}} an appropriate model and quantifying the risk premiums {{of the various}} underlying factors. In this paper, we use {{the information in the}} cross-section of S&P futures options from 1987 to 2003 to examine these issues. We first test for the presence of <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> volatility by analyzing the higher moment behavior of option implied variance. The option data provides strong evidence supporting the presence of <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> volatility. In conjunction with previous results, this implies that stochastic volatility, <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> returns and <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> volatility are all important components. Next, we find strong cross-sectional evidence <b>in</b> support of <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> returns, and modest evidence for <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> volatility. We find evidence for reasonable jump risk premiums, but do not find any evidence for a diffusive volatility risk premium. We also find strong evidence for time variation in thejumpriskpremiums...|$|R
