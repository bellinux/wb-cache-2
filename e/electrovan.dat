50|$|In 1966, General Motors {{developed}} the concept vehicle <b>Electrovan,</b> {{based on the}} GMC Handi-Van. The vehicle used a Union Carbide cryogenic fuel cell to power a 115-horsepower electric motor. It never went into production due to cost issues and safety concerns.|$|E
50|$|In 1970 he fitted his own Austin A40 with a {{hydrogen}} fuel cell (ammonia being too hard to come by), and used the adapted vehicle as his personal transportation for over three years. The vehicle retained enough room inside for four passengers and had a driving range of 180 miles. His fuel cell design {{provided the basis for}} the 40 kWh alkaline hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell for the General Motors <b>Electrovan.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{member of}} the {{engineering}} staff, Bond worked for General Motors (GM) from July 1960 {{until his retirement in}} February 1993. His early work involved one of GM's earliest electric cars, the Electrovair II, a 1966 Corvair Monza sedan powered by silver-zinc batteries. The battery pack gave the Electrovair II a similar performance to that of the conventional gasoline powered Corvair which the car was based on with a top speed of 80 mph. As the project manager of the Electrovair II, Bond served as the spokesperson and driver when the car was demonstrated to the press in October 1966. It is the oldest historic vehicle on display at the GM Heritage Center in Sterling Heights, Michigan. Bond then worked with the <b>Electrovan,</b> which is credited as the world's first hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicle. The <b>Electrovan</b> had a top speed of 70 mph, was able to accelerate from 0-60 mph in 30 seconds and had a range of 120 to 150 miles. It is currently on display at the GM Heritage Center in Sterling Heights, Michigan.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} the fuel cell was first {{demonstrated}} by Humphry Davy in 1801, but {{the invention of the}} first working fuel cell is credited to William Grove, a chemist, lawyer, and physicist. Grove's experiments with what he called a [...] "gas voltaic battery" [...] proved in 1842 that an electric current could be produced by the electrochemical reaction of breaking the hydrogen atom. The first modern fuel cell vehicle was a modified Allis-Chalmers farm tractor, fitted with a 15 kilowatt fuel cell, around 1959. [...] The Cold War Space Race drove further development of fuel cell technology. Project Gemini tested fuel cells to provide electrical power during manned space missions. [...] Fuel cell development continued with the Apollo Program. The electrical power systems in the Apollo capsules and lunar modules used alkali fuel cells. [...] In 1966, General Motors developed the first fuel cell road vehicle, the Chevrolet <b>Electrovan.</b> It had a PEM fuel cell, a range of 120 miles and a top speed of 70 mph. There were only two seats, as the fuel cell stack and large tanks of hydrogen and oxygen took up the rear portion of the van. Only one was built, as the project was deemed cost-prohibitive.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} the fuel cell traces its roots {{all the way back}} to William Grove’s famous {{experiments}} on water electrolysis in 1839, but the commercialization history of fuel cell technologies remains rather limited over 150 years later. Throughout the later part of the 19 th and early part of the 20 th centuries, attempts were made to develop fuel cells that could directly convert coal or some other carbon material into electricity, but these attempts were unsuccessful because scientific knowledge of material properties and electrochemistry was lacking. The first fuel cell capable of producing significant quantities of electricity was developed by Francis Bacon in 1932. This system used an alkaline electrolyte and nickel electrodes to produce electricity using hydrogen and oxygen. By 1952, Bacon had produced a 5 kW system, and this provided much of the basis for further work on fuel cells in the 1950 s and 1960 s. Fuel cell development received a boost in the late 1950 s, when the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) determined that fuel cell technology was the most promising option for producing electricity in space in a compact and safe fashion. Nuclear power was considered too dangerous, batteries were too heavy, and solar power was too cumbersome. NASA eventually funded over 200 research contracts for fuel cell technology, and used both alkaline and proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) in the Apollo, Gemini, and space shuttle programs. The Gemini program utilized 1 kW PEMFC units from 1965 to 1966, while 1. 5 kW alkaline fuel cell (AFC) units were used in the Apollo program from 1968 to 1972. More recently, three 12 kW AFC units have been used for at least 87 missions with 65 000 h flight time in the space shuttle Orbiter. [1] Altogether more than 100 manned space flights have been made by the US, totaling over 90 000 h of operating time, and all of these have used fuel cell systems developed by the United Technologies Corporation (UTC) of Windsor, CT. The experience of UTC and its International Fuel Cells (IFC) unit with fuel cells for the space program led to the development of the first truly commercial fuel cell system, the PC 25 phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) product. This stationary fuel cell generating system, now in its third generation design, produces electricity from natural gas that is reformed into a hydrogen-rich gas stream before being supplied to the fuel cell stack. PC 25 s were first manufactured by IFC’s ONSI division in 1991, and approximately 200 of these 200 kW fuel cell systems have now been purchased and deployed throughout the US and in other countries. Many of these systems were either procured under a US Department of Defense (DOD) fuel cell purchase program, where about 30 units were purchased and operated at US DOD facilities, or through a $ 1000 kW− 1 fuel cell purchase subsidy program also administered through the US DOD. [2] For motor vehicle applications, General Motors has the longest history among major automakers, having experimented with fuel cell technology in the 1960 s and having demonstrated the world’s first drivable fuel cell passenger vehicle in 1966. General Motors designed this vehicle, called the “Electrovan”, with liquid hydrogen and oxygen fuel tanks, and it achieved a range of 150 miles and a top speed of 70 miles h− 1. The <b>Electrovan</b> program demonstrated General Motors’ early interest in developing fuel cell vehicles for commercial use, but it also uncovered the several obstacles that then became the focus of research and development. These included the needs for improved electronics, breakthroughs in electrochemistry, and new fuel cell stack and system materials. [3] During the decade of the 1990 s, fuel cells experienced an intense phase of research and development that led to the formation of many new companies and the establishment of new divisions within established companies, and a complex series of corporate mergers and re-organizations. Many different companies are now planning to commercialize several different fuel cell technologies for a wide range of markets. These fuel cell technologies include the PEMFC, AFC, and PAFC technologies mentioned above, but also higher temperature solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) types. A variation of the PEMFC can also use methanol directly, without first reforming it into hydrogen; it is known as a direct-methanol fuel cell (DMFC). There also is an interesting class of metal/air fuel cells that could also be considered “mechanically recharged” batteries, and that may be attractive for certain niche applications. Fuel cells are currently being developed for the following applications: • power for portable electronic devices (5 – 50 W) • power for remote telecommunications applications (100 W– 1 kW) • power for construction and outdoor recreational uses (1 – 3 kW) • auxiliary power units for cars and trucks, and motive power for scooters (3 – 5 kW) • stationary power generation (1 kW– 50 MW) • electric passenger car, utility vehicle, and bus power systems (20 kW– 250 kW). Some fuel cell companies are focusing on a single fuel cell type and application combination, while other companies are investigating more than one fuel cell technology and various potential applications. The following sections of this chapter briefly describe the current state of fuel cell industries for the stationary power and transportation markets, some of the commercialization plans for these two sectors, and additional thoughts about prospects for market commercialization of fuel cell technology. We do not discuss in detail the prospects for fuel cell for portable electronic devices, since this application is rather distinct and still at a relatively early stage of development...|$|E
