5000|$|In 1992, [...] "In My Life", Lamond's sophomore {{album was}} released, {{bolstered by the}} lead single, [...] "Where <b>Does</b> <b>That</b> <b>Leave</b> Love", which quickly charted high. The album {{contained}} a solid mix of freestyle and pop along with a couple ballads, all intended to further build his name within mainstream music. But national pop radio, at the time, was going thru a seismic shift, with a heavy R&B influence. By the time the album’s third and final single, [...] "I Want You Back" [...] was released (Spring, 1993), a remake of the Jackson 5 classic, with backing vocals by a then-relatively unknown Marc Anthony, Lamond would subsequently be dropped from Columbia Records.|$|E

5000|$|In November 2010, in an {{interview}} on the radio station WVON, Meeks advocated that only African Americans should be qualified for city contracts designated for minorities and women. During the conversation, he stated, [...] "The word 'minority' from our standpoint should mean African American. I don’t think women, Asians and Hispanics should be able to use that title. That’s why our numbers cannot improve — because we use women, Asians and Hispanics who are not people of color, who are not people who have been discriminated against". He later retracted his statement by saying he would only forbid white women if elected mayor. He told television station WFLD, [...] "I don’t believe white women should be considered in that count ….You have white women in the category. They receive contracts. Then, white men receive contracts. Where <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>leave</b> everybody else"? The next day, Meeks released a written statement further elucidating his comments. It stressed that [...] "all minority- and women-owned businesses" [...] are entitled to their [...] "fair share" [...] of city contracts.|$|E
5000|$|Champion was {{received}} more positively by critics than its predecessor, Controversy Loves Company. Jason McNeil from AllMusic wrote [...] "Champion {{is a rather}} uneven affair throughout the record. Perhaps {{the highlight of the}} album is when The Audition slows things down for the melancholic, slow-building [...] "What Gets You Through the Night" [...] that comes up very strong, resembling a tight, punchy cross between Maroon 5 and U2. Another sleeper pick is the sparkling [...] "Make It Rain" [...] Overall, The Audition pass the audition, but not with flying colors." [...] Bfhurricane from sputnikmusic.com Gave the album a 3 out 5 and praised Seth Johnson's guitar riffs and solos, bassist Joe Lussa's basslines, Danny Stevens's vocals stating that [...] "you can’t help but to admire how much spirit he’s putting in to his songs. He’s a singer that you can tell really does what he does for the love of it, inspired by real emotion and a desire to let it all out." [...] Later on the review he wrote [...] " [...] There’s not a single song on this album that I wouldn’t call enjoyable. However, the album as a whole really doesn’t show much diversity. While there’s a plethora of mentionable riffs and vocal hooks, {{there is a lack of}} musical maturity throughout Champion. They’re not tied to any style, timeline, and they don’t have much of a reputation to lose with experimentation. Which is what this album is - a fun experiment testing the creativity of the musicians of The Audition. I can safely say that there’s not a single bad moment on the album, but it’s nothing more than a combination of a bunch of good riffs and melodies focused around the same emotions. The album as a whole is colorful, funky, and fresh, but still a little immature. The Audition is still a young band, and with time they’re going to mature into some serious hard-hitters with some great singles, But until then, however, they’ll make a great supporting act for the bigger bands." [...] Exclaim!'s Sari Delmar rated the album [...] "Unfavourable" [...] stating [...] "while Chicago's sweethearts have refined their sugar-coated vocals and stepped it up to a whole new level of poppy-ness, they seem to have toned down the originality. And it is unfortunate because now instead of sounding fresh and rejuvenated, they just sound out of ideas. [...] "Hell to Sell could have easily slid onto Cobra Starship's new album, while [...] "Edinboro could have been written by 30 Seconds to Mars.
