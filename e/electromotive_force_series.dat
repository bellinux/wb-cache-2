40|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{recognized}} that the <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> (emf) can be induced just by the spin precession where the generation of the <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> has been considered as a real-space topological pumping effect.

It was also demonstrated that the rigid domain wall (DW) motion cannot generate <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> in the system. Based on real-space topological pumping approach in the current study we show that the <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> can be induced by rigid motion of a deformed DW.

40|$|The anode break {{excitation}} in Chara membrane {{was analyzed}} {{with a model}} consist-ing of an <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> (emf) in <b>series</b> with a resistance r (= l/g). The emf was found to shift toward depolarization during supply of an inward current. Whenever the shift of the emf went beyond a threshold depolarization, an action potential was brought about {{after the end of}} or even during the inward current supply. The anode break excitation is an action potential which is observed after the end of a constant inward current supply. One of the classical works on the strength-duration relation for this response was done by Lucas (/) with toad sartorius muscle. His strength-duration curve consisted of at least three curves superimposed, each of which appeared to be almost a hyperbola. He assumed corresponding three different excitable substances. Later many analyses of this response were tried by adopting the two-factor theory of excitation. These are summarized by Cole (2). The experimental foci were on discussion of the time constants of excitation and accomodation (3, 4). However, the physical meaning of the parameters which had been adopted in th...|$|R
