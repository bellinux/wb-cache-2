6000|$|Mr. Churchill's second {{proposition}} is the correlative of the first. How shall this imposing {{fabric of}} industrial security be reared and made safe? The answer is, by modifying, without vitally changing, {{the basis of}} taxation. The workman cannot be asked to pay for everything, as under Protection he must pay. In any case, he must pay for something. But if he is asked for too much, the sources of physical efficiency are drained, and {{the main purpose of}} the new Liberalism--the ideal of an educated, hopeful, and vigorous people--is destroyed. Now Liberalism, in ceasing to rely on indirect taxation as its main source of revenue, has opened up for contribution not merely the superfluities of society, the [...] "accumulations of profit," [...] as Mr. Churchill calls them, but those special forms of wealth which are [...] "social" [...] in origin, which depend on some monopoly of material agents, on means not of helping the community but of hindering it, not of enriching its powers and resources, but of depleting them for private advantage. In other words, the State in future will increasingly ask the taxpayer not only [...] "What have you got?" [...] but [...] "How did you get it?" [...] No one contends that such an analysis can be perfect; but, on the other hand, can a community desirous of realising what Goethe calls [...] "practical Christianity," [...] ignore it? And if in this process it enters the sphere of morals, as Ruskin long ago urged it to do, as well as the path of economic justice, is the step a wrong one? Has it not already been taken not only <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>Budget,</b> but in its predecessor, in which the Prime Minister made the memorable distinction between earned and unearned income?
