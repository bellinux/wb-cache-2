50|$|In 1975, the <b>Experimental</b> <b>Meteorology</b> Laboratory was enfolded into NHRL and {{it became}} known as the National Hurricane and <b>Experimental</b> <b>Meteorology</b> Laboratory (NHEML) for the next six years. NHEML engaged in several cloud {{modification}} studies as hurricane activity remained low. NHEML gained access to new Orion P-3 aircraft in 1975 and 1976 to replace the DC-6s. The new airframes also had better instrumentation, including digitized radars and cloud physics probes.|$|E
50|$|The William Gaskell Medal {{was awarded}} {{annually}} by the Royal Meteorological Society to {{a scientist who}} has distinguished himself {{in the field of}} <b>experimental</b> <b>meteorology.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 23 October 1791 Bartels studied {{mathematics}} under Johann Friedrich Pfaff in Helmstedt and Abraham Gotthelf Kästner in Göttingen. In {{the winter}} semester of 1793/1794 he studied <b>Experimental</b> Physics, Astronomy, <b>Meteorology</b> and Geology under Georg Christoph Lichtenberg.|$|R
40|$|Alessandro Serpieri (1823 - 1885) may be {{considered}} as a typical member of nineteenth-century italian scientist; although these scientists have not been much studied until now, however they were fundamental in order to promote the acquisition of technological knowledge’s for the following industrial evolution in Italy. A. Serpieri applied to astronomy, theoretical and <b>experimental</b> physics, <b>meteorology</b> and seismology furnishing interesting and original results in all these fields. We present here the list of his (known) scientific correspondents, following both chronological and analytical order; at last we list a group of letters from A. Serpieri to F. Cecchi...|$|R
50|$|He studied natural {{sciences}} at the University of Göttingen, and later on, worked {{as an assistant to}} Georg Hermann Quincke at the University of Heidelberg. In 1877 he obtained his habilitation at Heidelberg, and afterwards taught classes in <b>experimental</b> physics and <b>meteorology</b> at the Agricultural Academy in Proskau. From 1881 onward, he served as a professor at the Agricultural University of Berlin.|$|R
50|$|By 1966 {{she became}} the {{director}} of Project Stormfury while chief of the <b>Experimental</b> <b>Meteorology</b> Branch of the Environment Satellite Services Administration's Institute for Atmospheric Sciences. She eventually became NASA's lead weather researcher and authored or co-authored over 190 articles.|$|E
50|$|With {{the decline}} in enthusiasm for weather {{modification}} {{and the end of}} Project STORMFURY in 1983, a portion of the <b>Experimental</b> <b>Meteorology</b> scientists were transferred out of the NHEML to the former Environmental Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, with the remaining organization once again resuming the title of NHRL. In 1984, NHRL was renamed the Hurricane Research Division, or HRD, of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, or AOML. This meant moving the hurricane researchers from their offices co-located with the NHC out to NOAA's AOML facility, located on Virginia Key, a barrier island located between downtown Miami and Key Biscayne.|$|E
50|$|From 1971 to 1974 {{he worked}} as a {{research}} scientist at the NOAA <b>Experimental</b> <b>Meteorology</b> Lab (EML), from 1974 to 1981 he was an associate professor at the University of Virginia (UVa), served the primary academic position of his career as a professor at Colorado State University (CSU) from 1981 to 2006, was deputy of Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) at Colorado State University from 1985 to 1988, from 1999 to 2006 was Colorado State Climatologist, at Duke University was a research professor from 2003 to 2006, and was a visiting professor at the University of Arizona from October-December 2004. Since 2005, Pielke has served as Senior Research Scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at CU-Boulder and an emeritus professor of the Department of Atmospheric Science at CSU. After retiring from CSU and he remains a CIRES emeritus researcher.|$|E
50|$|Regener {{was born}} in Schleusenau (Wilczak) near Bromberg (Bydgoszcz), West Prussia. He studied physics from 1900 to 1905 at the University of Berlin under Emil Warburg and from 1909 worked with Heinrich Rubens. In 1911 he became {{professor}} of <b>experimental</b> physics and <b>meteorology</b> at the Agricultural University of Berlin. In 1920 he became the professor in experimental physics at the University of Stuttgart working alongside the theoretical physicist Paul Peter Ewald. During this time, he developed instruments to measure cosmic rays at various altitudes. Regener's leadership in this field is not always fully recognised as he was persecuted during the Nazi era because his wife was of Jewish ancestry. It {{has been argued that}} the naming of terms such as Pfotzer maximum after his student Georg Pfotzer is misleading as Regener was the principal scientist for this work.|$|R
5000|$|Blanchard studied {{meteorology}} at Florida State University (FSU) {{where he}} earned a B.S. and at Colorado State University (CSU) where {{he earned a}} M.S. in 1983 with the thesis Variability of the Convective Field Pattern in South Florida and its Relationship to the Synoptic Flow and a Ph.D. in 1994 with the dissertation Jet-induced Inertial Instabilities and the Growth of Mesoscale Convective Systems. From 1978-1980 Blanchard worked at the NOAA National Hurricane and <b>Experimental</b> <b>Meteorology</b> Laboratory (NHEML) in Coral Gables, Florida after which {{he moved to the}} Office of Weather Research and Modification (OWRM) in Boulder, Colorado until 1982 when he worked at the Weather Research Program (WRP) until 1988. Blanchard was at the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) in Boulder from 1998-1994, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) from 1994-1995, and returned to NSSL Boulder from 1996-1999. Since 1999 he has been a meteorologist at National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs).|$|E
