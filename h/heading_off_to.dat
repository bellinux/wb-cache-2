5|$|After heading east {{past the}} {{junction}} with I-69, the highway turns southeast as it heads through rural fields toward Eaton Rapids. Once {{it reaches the}} city, M-50 converges with M-99, and the two intersect M-188 {{on the south side}} of the Grand River. The two highways run south out of the city. Immediately prior to entering Jackson County, the two trunklines diverge with M-99 <b>heading</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the southwest and M-50 to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|Manning and the Vols {{started off}} the 1995 season with {{victories}} over East Carolina and SEC rival Georgia, before <b>heading</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Gainesville to face off against the rival Gators. Against Florida, he threw for 326yards and two touchdowns, leading the Vols to a 30–21 halftime lead. However, the Gators outscored the Vols 41–7 {{in the second}} half, winning 62–37. This was the Vols' only loss of the season, as they won their remaining eight regular season games, including a 41–14 win over rival Alabama and then defeated Ohio State in the Citrus Bowl. The Vols ended the season ranked third and Manning came in sixth in Heisman Trophy voting.|$|E
25|$|The main Temple of Mars (Aedes Martis) in the Republican period also lay {{outside the}} sacred {{boundary}} and {{was devoted to}} the god's warrior aspect. It was built to fulfill a vow (votum) made by a Titus Quinctius in 388 BC during the Gallic siege of Rome. The founding day (dies natalis) was commemorated on June 1, and the temple is attested by several inscriptions and literary sources. The sculpture group of Mars and the wolves was displayed there. Soldiers sometimes assembled at the temple before <b>heading</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> war, {{and it was the}} point of departure for a major parade of Roman cavalry held annually on July 15.|$|E

25|$|Stewart {{was born}} in Syracuse, New York, to Brian and Heather Stewart and has a younger brother named Connor. Breanna began playing {{basketball}} at an early age; in fifth grade, she decided to improve her game. Now six feet four inches tall, {{she had always been}} tall for her age, which often meant coaches wanted her inside as a rebounder. However, her father thought it would help if she had ball handling skills and a perimeter shooting ability. Stewart started a routine of dribbling around her block, wearing headphones. She completed enough loops to cover a mile. She continued the routine almost every day, improving her ball handling to the point she routinely dribbled behind her back or between her legs. Even after <b>heading</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> college, she still did the routine at home.|$|E
25|$|This was the two teams' 85th Big Game, and {{was played}} on Cal's home field, California Memorial Stadium. Although Cal was {{guaranteed}} {{a winning record}} (with bowl eligibility) for the season, no bowl game was looking to invite them. The implications of this game were far more important to Stanford, led by quarterback John Elway, playing in his last regular season game before <b>heading</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> become a future National Football League star enshrined in both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame. The Cardinal football squad {{was in the midst}} of an exciting season—they were 5–5 but had victories over highly ranked Ohio State and Washington—and needed a win to be eligible to play in a bowl game. Representatives of the Hall of Fame Classic committee were in attendance, apparently to extend an invitation to Stanford, if the Cardinal won.|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} album, Duff {{embarked}} on a worldwide arena tour. Entitled the Still Most Wanted Tour, the tour—an extension of the Most Wanted Tour (2004–05)—began on July 12, 2005 in Los Angeles, California at the Greek Theatre, with a United States leg. Following {{the end of the}} US leg in September, it visited Australia in December. Duff then made her Canadian touring debut in January 2006, before <b>heading</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Europe in April. She then visited Latin America, before closing the tour up with various dates in North America from June to September 2006. The set list contained songs from Metamorphosis and Hilary Duff. Duff also premiered [...] "Wake Up", [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] and [...] "Break My Heart" [...] on the tour.|$|E

500|$|In January 2002, Jon Lee {{committed}} suicide in his Miami home, resulting in the band keeping {{out of the public}} eye for most of the year. It was during this time that lead-singer Grant Nicholas wrote a series of songs relating to their emotions and reactions to Jon's death, which formed their fourth album Comfort in Sound. The band brought in former Skunk Anansie and Little Angels member Mark Richardson for drumming duties. The album focused mainly on themes such as loss, depression, grief and positivity, while dedicating [...] "Quickfade" [...] to Jon. The album was released in October of the same year to widespread critical acclaim in the British music press, with Kerrang! alongside the heavy rock magazine Metal Hammer giving the album their respective Album of the Week accolades. The band were invited to the Reading and Leeds festivals that year, headlining the second stage at Reading on the first day which took place on 23 August, before <b>heading</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Leeds the next. Grant also mentioned that at the time their fourth album already had a series of backing tracks recorded, with a total of 15 when recording is completed with then 10 chosen for the final album, when the final track listing was revealed, this was increased to 12. The album is currently Feeder's best-seller with an estimated 503,706 units sold as of April 2012. The album charted at #98 in Japan and #28 in Ireland, beating the peak position of #57 that Echo Park managed during the previous year. In Japan, it would be the first time Feeder ever charted there. The album charted at number six in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the book}} The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, {{the size of}} the initial {{garrison}} at Helm's Deep for Rohan was nearly 1,000, but many more were coming into the fort from across Rohan. The estimated number of total Rohirrim defenders was 2,000 by the time Saruman's army arrived. Merry says that the force that left Isengard numbered 10,000 at least, most marching towards Helm's Deep and others <b>heading</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the Fords of Isen. This number is later qualified by Gandalf: [...] "I have about ten thousand Orcs to manage", so considerably more than 10,000 when the Men of Dunland are added. Though the battle appears severely lopsided, as Uruk-hai were much better in battle than simple orcs, the defenders managed to hold the fort until a force of almost 1,000 men on foot led by Gandalf along with a forest of Huorns arrived at dawn {{in the rear of the}} hosts of Isengard and surround the Uruks.|$|E
2500|$|This new band {{made its}} debut at London's Astoria Theatre on 1 October 1982 (the day after Tibbs and Miall's {{contracts}} ran out) and played a further five UK provincial tour dates on 1–6 November 1982 before <b>heading</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the USA {{for the start of}} a US tour in New York on 8 November. The New York concert was the first of 26 club-level US tour dates running up to the concert of 16 December 1982 in Hollywood California. These concerts were intended as a warm-up for a more intensive 1983 US tour of over 60 dates, scheduled to run until May 1983. However, on the nineteenth tour date on 20 February 1983 in Cleveland, Ohio, disaster struck when Ant suffered an injured knee onstage (a relapse of a previous injury suffered while filming Jubilee in 1977), forcing the postponement and/or cancellation of dates throughout February and March while he recuperated. [...] Ant eventually returned to action when he appeared as a guest performer on the NBC television network's [...] special filmed on 25 March 1983 in Pasadena, California (and aired in May that year), performing Where Did Our Love Go, during which he was joined onstage by Diana Ross. [...] The following evening in Palm Desert, he resumed the US tour, which was finally completed on 18 May 1983 at the Bronco Bowl in Dallas, Texas.|$|E
