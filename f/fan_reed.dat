2500|$|As he {{had done}} with Berlin after Transformer, in 1975 Reed responded to {{commercial}} success with a commercial failure, a double album of electronically generated audio feedback, Metal Machine Music. Critics interpreted it {{as a gesture of}} contempt, an attempt to break his contract with RCA or to alienate his less sophisticated <b>fans.</b> <b>Reed</b> claimed that the album was a genuine artistic effort, even suggesting that quotations of classical music could be found buried in the feedback. Lester Bangs declared it [...] "genius", though also psychologically disturbing. The album was reportedly returned to stores by the thousands after a few weeks. Though later admitting that the liner notes' list of instruments is fictitious and intended as parody, Reed continued to maintain that MMM was a serious album; though {{at the time he was}} [...] "very stoned". In the 2000s it was adapted for orchestral performance by the German ensemble Zeitkratzer.|$|R

50|$|The Toronto Blue Jays signed Stewart to a {{minor league}} deal on February 24, 2008, and gave their former first-round pick an {{invitation}} to spring training. Stewart ended up being chosen by the Jays to take over left field in a platoon with Matt Stairs, over <b>fan</b> favorite <b>Reed</b> Johnson who was released by the team. On March 30, the Blue Jays purchased Stewart's contract from Triple-A Syracuse. He was released by the Blue Jays on August 11.|$|R
5000|$|Despite his {{relative}} anonymity, Reed {{enjoyed a}} cult {{following in the}} city of Scranton, Pennsylvania throughout his career. A group of young baseball <b>fans</b> chose <b>Reed</b> as their alternative hero to more popular choices such as Don Mattingly or Ken Griffey Jr. The motto of the fan club: [...] "We support the role playing Jeff Reed because in life, who among us is truly a superstar, and how many of us are the role players?" [...] Reed remains hugely popular in Scranton to this day, almost twenty years after his professional career ended.|$|R
2500|$|Forza Motorsport {{received}} universal acclaim {{according to}} the review aggregation website Metacritic. The game was also featured in the June 2004 issue of Popular Science. Reviewers praised the game's advantages over Gran Turismo 4. Che Chou of 1UP.com commented that Forza was the [...] "most realistic console racer ever made". GameSpot's Brian Ekberg noted how well the game balanced accessibility and pleasing genre <b>fans.</b> Kristan <b>Reed</b> of Eurogamer liked the game's online integration. [...] In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight, two sevens, and one nine {{for a total of}} 31 out of 40.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, Neil Gaiman was {{approached}} by an Epic Records executive, seeking help in developing a concept album for Alice Cooper. Gaiman {{was interested in the}} project, having been familiar with Cooper, telling Spin that [...] "when I was a kid 15 years earlier than that, I had read Marvel Premiere #50, Alice Cooper: Tales From the Inside, and I also loved Welcome to My Nightmare. My cousins were the Alice Cooper fans; I was the David Bowie, Lou <b>Reed</b> <b>fan.</b> But they had made me watch 'Teenage Lament '74' on Top of the Pops." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Reed's</b> <b>fans</b> eagerly {{anticipated}} his [...] "business" [...] in {{the many}} encores that followed some of his songs, in which [...] "his antics would become ever more outrageous. ... Reed's Sir Joseph Porter would jump overboard only to re-enter clutching a rubber life-ring, while ... his Ko-Ko would be found furiously – and anachronistically – pedalling across the stage in a toy car." [...] On the other hand, he was sometimes criticised for these instances of dropping character and adding anachronisms. He explained, [...] "An encore is a different thing [...] a bit of fun {{between me and the}} audience [...] then I come right back into character again." ...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Les punks, a Parisian {{subculture}} of Lou <b>Reed</b> <b>fans,</b> had already become well established. Initially, two central figures were Marc Zermati, who had founded Skydog Records in Paris in 1972, owned the Open Market record shop, and promoted American and British bands in France; and Michel Esteban, {{the owner of}} the Harry Cover rock merchandise shop and founder of Rock News magazine, who had associated with leading punk and new wave musicians in New York City. The first European Punk Rock Festival, organised by Zermati, took place at Mont-de-Marsan on 21 August 1976, and featured French bands Bijou, Il Biaritz and Shakin’ Street, as well as The Damned.|$|R
60|$|Ugh-lomi lay still, {{his back}} against an alder, and his thigh was a red mass terrible to see. No civilised man could have lived who had been so sorely wounded, but Eudena got him thorns to close his wounds, and squatted beside him day and night, smiting the flies from him with a <b>fan</b> of <b>reeds</b> by day, and in the night {{threatening}} the hyænas with the first axe in her hand; and {{in a little while}} he began to heal. It was high summer, and there was no rain. Little food they had during the first two days his wounds were open. In the low place where they hid were no roots nor little beasts, and the stream, with its water-snails and fish, was in the open a hundred yards away. She could not go abroad by day for fear of the tribe, her brothers and sisters, nor by night for fear of the beasts, both on his account and hers. So they shared the lion with the vultures. But there was a trickle of water near by, and Eudena brought him plenty in her hands.|$|R
50|$|Delivery of {{the above}} air {{freshener}} mechanisms falls into two broad categories: continuous action and instant action. Continuous action products include scented candles and devices which use a candle flame or some other heat source to heat and vaporize a fragrance formulation, incense burners, wall plug-ins which either use piezoelectric technology to aerosolize fragrance or heat to vaporize it, fragrance impregnated gels which release fragrance as the gel evaporates sometimes {{with the help of}} an electric <b>fan,</b> wick and <b>reed</b> diffusers which release fragrance by evaporation from fragrance-soaked wicks or wooden reeds; and fragrance impregnated materials like floor wax, paper, plastics, wood which release fragrance by off gassing; and lastly nebulization systems which convert liquid fragrances into a vapor in a cold process without the use of heat.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, {{punk rock}} scenes were {{emerging}} around the globe. In France, les punks, a Parisian subculture of Lou <b>Reed</b> <b>fans,</b> {{had already been}} around for years. Following the lead of Stinky Toys, Métal Urbain played its first concert in December 1976. In August 1977, Asphalt Jungle played at the second Mont de Marsan punk festival. Stinky Toys' debut single, [...] "Boozy Creed", came out in September. It was perhaps the first non-English-language punk rock record, though as music historian George Gimarc notes, the punk enunciation made that distinction somewhat moot. The following month, Métal Urbain's first 45, [...] "Panik", appeared. After the release of their minimalist punk debut, [...] "Rien à dire", Marie et les Garçons became involved in New York's mutant disco scene. Asphalt Jungle's [...] "Deconnection" [...] and Gasoline's [...] "Killer Man" [...] also came out {{before the end of}} the year, and other French punk acts such as Oberkampf and Starshooter soon formed.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the same}} night that Reed lost the North American title, he and partner Jim Neidhart beat Magnum T.A. and “Hacksaw" [...] Jim Duggan to win the Mid-South Tag Team Championship. After a few weeks the North American title was {{returned}} to Reed, claiming that the title match with T.A. was not legal since the <b>fans</b> chose JYD. <b>Reed’s</b> run as a double champion {{did not last long}} as JYD got his title shot with Dusty Rhodes as the special guest referee. After losing the North American title, Reed and Neidhart focused on the tag team titles and defended them against all comers. When Magnum and Mr. Wrestling II challenged for the titles, they felt that the challengers had to put up something of their own: Mr. Wrestling II’s mask. Mr. Wrestling did not unmask that night as they took the gold from Reed and Neidhart in a Steel cage match on Christmas of 1983. Neidhart and Reed started to blame each other and had a short, brutal feud.|$|R
5000|$|Uncut {{gave the}} record a {{positive}} review, singling out the closer [...] "Junior Dad" [...] for praise and calling it [...] "breathtaking" [...] and [...] "astonishing", a [...] "perfect ending {{to the most}} extraordinary, passionate and just plain brilliant record either participant has made for a long while." [...] NME, scoring the record seven out of ten, praised it as [...] "a surprising triumph", {{and said that the}} offerings [...] "breadth and ambition is to be applauded. Metallica have performed way beyond what many thought them capable; they improvise freely as Reeds musical bitch, while for him this marks his most outré offering since Metal Machine Music". The Telegraph awarded Lulu three stars out of five, stating that while it was [...] "grueling, even by latter Lou Reed standards," [...] the sense of [...] "unrestrained folly" [...] and sheer lack of commercialism made the album feel [...] "important". The German edition of Metal Hammer gave it four out of seven stars. The reaction of the reviewer, Metallica biographer Joel McIver, was mixed. According to McIver, Lou Reed and Metallica had created an [...] "avant-garde theatrical" [...] soundtrack which is [...] "not easy to listen to" [...] and recommendable for Lou <b>Reed</b> <b>fans.</b> However Metallica fans [...] "will mostly ignore Lulu—and listen to Master of Puppets". In another contrarian review titled [...] "Metallica and Lou Reeds Lulu Is Actually Excellent", James Parker of The Atlantic wrote [...] "I dont think the record is crap. In fact I love it", and recommended, [...] "Give Lulu a shot. Give it another listen. Offer it what Lou would call your ‘coagulating heart,’ and you will be rewarded." ...|$|R
60|$|But I {{said the}} effect of its being so filled, because this, again, {{is of the essence}} of good design. With a simple spray of leaves and a bird in flight a Japanese artist will give you the {{impression}} that he has completely covered with lovely design the <b>reed</b> <b>fan</b> or lacquer cabinet at which he is working, merely because he knows the exact spot in which to place them. All good design depends on the texture of the utensil used and the use you wish to put it to. One of the first things I saw in an American school of design was a young lady painting a romantic moonlight landscape on a large round dish, and another young lady covering a set of dinner plates with a series of sunsets of the most remarkable colours. Let your ladies paint moonlight landscapes and sunsets, but do not let them paint them on dinner plates or dishes. Let them take canvas or paper for such work, but not clay or china. They are merely painting the wrong subjects on the wrong material, that is all. They have not been taught that every material and texture has certain qualities of its own. The design suitable for one is quite wrong for the other, just as the design which you should work on a flat table- cover ought to be quite different from the design you would work on a curtain, for the one will always be straight, the other broken into folds; and the use too one puts the object to should guide one in the choice of design. One does not want to eat one's terrapins off a romantic moonlight nor one's clams off a harrowing sunset. Glory of sun and moon, let them be wrought for us by our landscape artist and be {{on the walls of the}} rooms we sit in to remind us of the undying beauty of the sunsets that fade and die, but do not let us eat our soup off them and send them down to the kitchen twice a day to be washed and scrubbed by the handmaid.|$|R
