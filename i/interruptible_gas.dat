This will further facilitate decoupling the power system from the gas grid: as the largest consumer of the natural gas system, gas generators usually rely on the <b>interruptible</b> <b>gas</b> transportation which {{are the first to}} be curtailed during congestion [43].|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} data collected from gas service providers and end-use customers in the six New England States and offers a preliminary assessment {{of the impact of}} <b>interruptible</b> <b>gas</b> customers on the distillate fuel oil market this past winter. Based on information collected and analyzed as of October 2000, the main findings areas follows: (1) For <b>interruptible</b> <b>gas</b> customers with distillate fuel oil as a backup fuel, their volume of interruptions was equivalent to about 1 to 2 percent of the total sales of distillate fuel oil in New England during January-February 2000. For the two peak weeks of gas supply interruptions, however, the equivalent volume of distillate fuel oil amounted to an estimated 3 to 6 percent of total sales in New England. There were no interruptions of the natural gas service during the 2 -month period. (2) Purchases of distillate fuel oil by <b>interruptible</b> <b>gas</b> customers may have contributed somewhat to the spike in the price of distillate fuel oil in January-February 2000, especially during the peak weeks of gas interruptions. Nevertheless, other factors [...] a sudden drop in temperatures, low regional stocks of distillate fuels, and weather-related supply problems during a period of high customer demand [...] appear to have {{played a significant role in}} this price spike, as they have in previous spikes. (3) While this preliminary analysis suggests that interruptible natural gas service does not threaten the stability of the home heating oil market, several steps might be taken-without undermining the benefits of interruptible service [...] to reduce the potential adverse impacts of gas supply interruptions in times of market stress. Regardless of the magnitude of the impact of distillate fuel oil purchases by <b>interruptible</b> <b>gas</b> customers on Northeast heating oil markets, the threat of future heating oil price spikes and supply problems still remains. To help counter the threat, President Clinton in July 2000 directed Secretary Richardson to establish a heating oil component of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the Northeast, and 2 million barrels of heating oil are now stored in the reserve. Other possible policy options are outlined...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{marketing}} strategy of <b>interruptible</b> <b>gas</b> consumers is proposed on analyzing {{situation of the}} supply and users structure at one northern city in China. The serious problem in gas distribution companies is the increasing peak and valley rate, which is becoming more lethal one while the upstream pipeline companies change the gas price from one step to two steps. This paper finds a comparable good solution to promote dual-fuel burner on gas consumer market, building an interruptible part in demand side which {{is a better way}} that can make the gas company to accommodate the balance between supply and demand more effectively. The technical feasibility and some foreign gas company experience related to this sector are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|A quasi-optimal {{technique}} ('quasi' in {{that the}} technique discards unreasonable optimums), realized by a dynamically evolving mixed integer program, is used to develop regional electric power maintenance and production schedules for a two to five year planning horizon. This sophisticated, yet computationally feasible, method is used to develop the bulk dispatch schedules required to meet electric power demands at a given reliability level while controlling the associated dollar costs and environmental impacts. The electric power system considered is a power exchange pool of closely coupled generation facilities supplying a region approximately the size of New England. Associated with a tradeoff between a given cost of production and the relevant ecological factors, an optimum production schedule is formulated which considers fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric, gas turbine and pumped storage generation facilities; power demands, reliabilities, maintenance and nuclear refueling requisites; labor coordination, geographic considerations, as well as various contracts such as interregional power exchanges, <b>interruptible</b> loads, <b>gas</b> contracts and nuclear refueling contracts. A prerequisite of the model was that it be flexible enough {{for use in the}} evaluation of the optimum system performance associated with hypothesized expansion patterns. Another requirement was that the effects of changed scheduling factors could be predicted, and if necessary corrected with a minimum computational effort. A discussion of other possible optimization techniques is included, however, this study was primarily intended as a development of a static procedure; a dynamic technique counterpart with a more probabilistic. approach is being undertaken as a Part II of this study and at its conclusion the two techniques will be compared. Although the inputs are precisely defined, this paper does not deal explicitly with any of the fabrications of the required inputs to the model. Rather, it is meant as a method of incorporating those inputs into the optimum operation schedule process.

30|$|Gas-fired units consume {{natural gas}} to {{generate}} electricity, {{which leads to the}} growing reliance of the power system on the natural gas system in recent years. Accordingly, several concerns on the interdependency and reliability of both energy systems need be considered. ① Unlike coal and fuel oil, natural gas is usually not stored on-site. That is, gas-fired units rely on real-time delivery of natural gas fuel through the natural gas network. ② Residential gas loads have higher priorities than industrial gas-fired power plants. Thus, peak demands of natural gas end-users would significantly affect the delivery of <b>interruptible</b> <b>gas</b> transportation service to gas-fired power plants. ③ As an inspiring feature for offering flexible dispatch and fast ramping capabilities, gas-fired units are expected {{to play an important role}} in offsetting variability and uncertainty associated with renewable resources. In turn, the natural gas network needs to provide enhanced operational flexibility for meeting volatile gas demands of gas-fired units.|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Quarterly Fuels Inquiry (QFI) is a quarterly survey among a panel of manufacturing plants. The survey is managed by ONS {{on behalf of the}} Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). Using this it is possible to calculate sectorial energy prices which are reported in publications such as Quarterly Energy Prices. This is the first external research study which had access to this data at micro level. It spans a period from 1993 to 2015. The inquiry is statutory, being conducted under Section 1 of the Statistics of Trade Act 1947. The aim of the inquiry is to collect data on the prices paid by small, medium and large industrial fuel consumers. The data by consumption band, available through QFI, are the only data of their kind available for the UK energy market. As such it allows cost comparisons to be made between various fuel types and between large and small users. These data are important in determining whether price movements for large and small users have been comparable and therefore providing data to examine any possible price discrimination in the fuel products. QFI data are widely used both within government and industry and are considered a vital source of data. The survey is used by officials and ministers to monitor trends in industrial prices, particularly for gas and electricity, and by companies as price escalators in fuel purchasing contracts. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research. For the third edition (April 2016), the 2015 quarter 2 revised data file and 2015 quarter 3 provisional data file {{have been added to the}} study. Main Topics : Respondents to QFI are asked to provide the volume and value of fuel purchased in the preceding quarter. Data are collected on: coal, coke, medium fuel oil, heavy fuel oil, gas oil, liquefied petroleum gas, electricity and firm and <b>interruptible</b> <b>gas,</b> although not all respondents use all these fuels. The data are then used to calculate a unit cost for each fuel used by size of user (for the more common used fuels) and an overall average...|$|E
