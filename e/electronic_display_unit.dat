The sign is 50 ft tall by 30 ft wide by 8 ft deep, and the total structure weighs more than 10 ST. The <b>electronic</b> <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> on the sign is 15 ft tall by 22 ft wide. It is double sided (there is one unit {{on each side of}} the sign), and each side has 43,000 full-color pixels. The sign can display 281 trillion colors, significantly more than the human eye can distinguish. Content is sent via wireless broad band communication from the casino marketing office. The sign uses energy-saving LED technology, and the cost of its energy consumption will be about $17.59 per day. More than 47,000 vehicles travel pass the FireKeepers Casino location daily, and the sign is expected to be seen by more than 66,000 persons each day.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nowadays {{accidents}} are occurring frequently, causing demise {{of many people}} by making modest mistakes while driving (in school zone, hills area, and highways). But sometimes {{it may not be}} possible to view the signboards placed by the Highway Department to alert the drivers in such kind of places and there is a chance for accident. The advancement in the processor technology and microcontrollers has opened a new system designed to prevent the accidents caused due to negligence of drivers in seeing traffic signals alongside the road and other anomalies on the roads. So to intimate the driver about the zones and to automatically maintain the speed is accomplished by means RF technology. The main objective is to design a <b>Electronic</b> <b>Display</b> controller meant for vehicle’s speed control and monitors the zones, which runs on an embedded system and can be custom designed to fit into a vehicle’s dashboard to display information on the vehicle. This system if adopted by some state can effectively reduce the number of road accidents caused by speeding vehicles losing control of the vehicle at speed breakers or by driver’s negligence towards traffic signals. This paper presents a new design to control the speed of the automobiles at remote places for fixed time. The project is composed of two separate units: Zone status transmitter <b>unit</b> and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Display</b> and Control <b>unit.</b> Once the road-sign signal is received from the zones, the vehicle’s <b>Electronic</b> <b>Display</b> Controller <b>Unit</b> warns the driver, to reduce the speed according to the zone, it waits for driver’s response and reduces the speed of vehicle automatically...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the {{accommodation}} facility after <b>electronic</b> visual <b>display</b> usage was used under two different surrounding lightings: one with and the other without room light. Accommodation facility is the capability of the eyes to respond and focus on visual stimuli at various distances, and could be measured clinically. Twenty young subjects participated in this study where the subjects were assigned to read binocularly from <b>electronic</b> visual <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> (VDU) for one hour under 2 different surrounding lighting conditions (with and without room light) at random sequence. Binocular accommodation facility was measured via standard clinical vision examination protocol using a ± 2. 00 DS lens flipper with 6 / 9 near visual acuity target. Friedman test showed no significant changes in binocular accommodation facility, [x 2 (2) = 5. 772,p= 0. 06 J. The difference in accommodation facility after one-hour VDU near task between the absence and presence of surrounding room light was negligible. Future studies should investigate the temporal aspects of the accommodation process during VDU task to understand the accommodation related VDU symptoms especially under low lighting...|$|R

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> paper <b>display</b> (EPD) {{has reached}} a {{position}} of great maturity. Due to its capability of bistability and great reflectivity, it can display an image without any flowing current. Today, sensors and regulators are being placed out to monitor the real world, and are often battery powered without a display. With the introduction of <b>electronic</b> paper <b>displays,</b> these <b>units</b> can be given a display without {{a significant increase in}} power. There is however still very limited power available, and power reduction is considered increasingly important. A theoretical and practical analysis of EPD, Thin-Film Transistor, and level shifters have been used to investigate power reduction techniques. The area of interest is the sub-circuits where level shifters are adopted. These sub-circuits typically carry over 60 % of the total power consumption during an electronic paper write cycle. Practical experiments and simulations have been used to find new power saving level shifters for these sub-circuits. The simulations have been successfully used to show different level shifters performing and running at two different frequencies (10 MHz and 2 Hz) using commercially available 180 nm technology. The results from the simulations in Cadence Virtuoso have shown that the proposed circuits perform about 80 % - 85 % better in terms of power at high frequency (10 MHz). The results also show that the proposed circuits perform about 65 % - 150 % worse in terms of power at low frequency (2 Hz). From the results, we have concluded that the proposed circuits are not better in low-frequency applications such as <b>electronic</b> paper <b>displays.</b> However storage capacitors can be added to electronic paper pixels which can potentially speed up the scan process, thereby making these results more applicable...|$|R

40|$|Purpose:  Most {{recently}} {{light and}} mobile reading devices with high display resolutions have become popular {{and they may}} open new possibilities for reading applications in education, business and the private sector. The ability to adapt font size may also open new reading opportunities for people with impaired or low vision. Based on their display technology two major groups of reading devices can be distinguished. One type, predominantly found in dedicated e-book readers, uses electronic paper also known as e-Ink. Other devices, mostly multifunction tablet-PCs, are equipped with backlit LCD displays. While {{it has long been}} accepted that reading on <b>electronic</b> <b>displays</b> is slow and associated with visual fatigue, this new generation is explicitly promoted for reading. Since research has shown that, compared to reading on <b>electronic</b> <b>displays,</b> reading on paper is faster and requires fewer fixations per line, one would expect differential effects when comparing reading behaviour on e-Ink and LCD. In the present study we therefore compared experimentally how these two display types are suited for reading {{over an extended period of}} time. Methods:  Participants read for several hours on either e-Ink or LCD, and different measures of reading behaviour and visual strain were regularly recorded. These dependent measures included subjective (visual) fatigue, a letter search task, reading speed, oculomotor behaviour and the pupillary light reflex. Results:  Results suggested that reading on the two display types is very similar in terms of both subjective and objective measures. Conclusions:  It is not the technology itself, but rather the image quality that seems crucial for reading. Compared to the visual <b>display</b> <b>units</b> used in the previous few decades, these more recent <b>electronic</b> <b>displays</b> allow for good and comfortable reading, even for extended periods of time...|$|R
