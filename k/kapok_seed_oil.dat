The existence of relatively abundant raw materials is a great opportunity to be developed into alternative energy options which developed on a commercial scale.

40|$|Background: Studies of the biogeographic {{distribution}} of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in plants are fundamental {{to understanding the}} mechanisms of adaptive evolution in plants as <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> is the primary energy source needed for germination and establishment of plants.

We also explore the role of multiple seed traits like <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition in plant adaptation in a phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic context. Result: It was observed that the <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in tropical plants (28. 4 %) {{was significantly higher than}} the temperate plants (24. 6 %). A significant relationship between oil content and latitude was observed in three families Papaveraceae, Sapindaceae and Sapotaceae indicating that selective forces correlated with latitude influence <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content. Evaluation of the response of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition to latitude and the correlation between <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition showed that multiple <b>seed</b> traits, <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition contribute towards plant adaptation. Investigation of {{the presence or absence of}} phylogenetic signals across 168 angiosperm families in 62 clades revealed that members of seven clades evolved to have high or low <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content independently as they did not share a common evolutionary path.

However, advances in understanding about the problems faced by the developing embryo during incubation are still being made; and some may help "fine-tune " the incubation process.

Problems with hatchability usually can be traced to factors such as infertility, faulty breeder nutrition, disease status, or poor egg handling and hygiene, rather than to faulty incubation technique per se.

Factor I consist of 4 supplementation levels, namely : 0 % (S 0); 5 % (S 1); 10 % (S 2), and 15 % (S 3), respectively, wheareas factor II consist of 5 protection levels, namely : 0 % (P 0); 25 % (P 1); 50 % (P 2); 75 % (P 3), and 100 % (P 4), repectivelly. Amount of 15 treatment combination were formed with control, namely without KSO supplementation and without protection (S 0 P 0). The measured variables included : relative proportion of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), i. e. : acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. In addition, the iodine number (IN) and relative proportion of long chain fatty acid (LCFA), i. e. : stearic acid and linoleic acid) omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acid) were also measured. Collected data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance with factorial treatment pattern in completely randomized design. The result of this investigation showed that supplementation 10 % or upper KSO without protection decreased asetis acid/propionic (A/P) ratio. Ratio of A/P tend increased again with protected KSO supplementation, but on 10 and 15 % supplementation levels still lower than control (1. 47 – 2. 99 vs 3. 36). Protected KSO supplementation increased the relative proportion of linoleic acid and unsaturation rate of ruminal fatty acid (P< 0, 05) with the higher iodine number, a long with enhancing of supplementation level. Relative proportion of linoleic acid and iodine number (IN) in S 1 P 0, S 2 P 0, S 2 P 3, S 2 P 4 and S 3 P 4 treatment groups were : 17, 65 and 10, 32; 33, 07 % and 18, 67; 42, 29 % and 41, 95; 45, 01 % and 47, 40; 45, 17 and 50, 99 %, respectively.

A number of 24 heads of male thin-tailed sheep were used as experimental material. These sheep were divided into 8 treatment groups. There were two treatment factors, i. e. : PKSO supplementation (S) as factor I and RB supplementation (K) as factor II. Factor I consisted of 2 levels, i. e. 0 % (S 0) and 10 % (S 1), whereas factor II consist of 4 levels, i. e. 0 % (K 0), 15 % (K 1), 30 % (K 2) and 45 % (K 3), respectively, based on dry matter (DM) intake. Several variables were measured, namely content of intra muscular fat (IMF), iodine number of muscular fatty acid, content of meat cholesterol and omega 6 fatty acid (in this case linoleic acid). The collected data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance with factorial treatment pattern (2 x 4) in completely randomized design (CRD). Content of IMF in sheep supplemented with 0 and 15 % KSO levels was not significantly different from those without <b>kapok</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> (KSO) supplementation at the same level of RB feeding (3. 45 and 3. 99 % vs 3. 01 and 3. 75 %). Supplementation of protected KSO in combination with 30 and 45 % RP resulted in significantly increased (P < 0. 05) IMF content (4. 75 and 5. 93 % vs 4. 32 and 5. 40 %) and significantly decreased (P < 0. 05) meat chollesterol content (62. 46 and 65. 26 mg/ 100 g vs 89. 21 and 72. 63 mg/ 100 g) also significantly increased (P < 0. 05) linoleic acid proportion (15. 52 and 18. 25 % vs 3. 68 and 4. 04 %) and iodine number (12. 52 and 10. 25 vs 4. 09 and 4. 98) ...|$|E

Terrace in energy consumption is not balanced with adequate fossil fuel reserves and will be totally depleted in the near future. Indonesian Government through a Presidential Decree No. 5 year 2006 mandates an increased capacity in renewable energy production from 5 percent to 15 percent in 2025. C. pentandra seed oil has feasibility as a sustainable biodiesel feedstock in Indonesia. The aim {{of this paper was}} to investigate biodiesel production from ceiba petandra seed oil using naturally potassium hydroxide catalyst. Research designs are based on factorial design with 2 levels and 3 independent variables (temperature, reaction time and molar ratio of methanol to oil). According to data calculation, the most influential single variable is molar ratio of methanol to oil.

40|$|The {{potential}} of oil {{extracted from the}} seeds of three different Nigerian citrus fruits for biodiesel production was investigated. Fatty acid alkyl esters were produced from orange <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> grape <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and tangerine <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> by transesterification of the oils with ethanol using potassium hydroxide as a catalyst. In {{the conversion of the}} citrus <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> to alkyl esters (biodiesel), the grape <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> gave the highest yield of 90. 6 %, while the tangerine <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and orange <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> gave a yield of 83. 1 % and 78. 5 %, respectively. Fuel properties of the <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and its biodiesel were determined. The results showed that orange <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> had a density of 730 Kg/m 3, a viscosity of 36. 5 mm 2 /s, and a pour point of- 14 o C; while its biodiesel fuel had a density of 892 Kg/m 3, a viscosity of 5. 60 mm 2 /s, and a pour point of- 25 o C. Grape <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> had a density of 675 Kg/m 3, a viscosity of 39. 5 mm 2 /s, and a pour point of- 12 o C, while its biodiesel fuel had a density of 890 Kg/m 3, a viscosity of 4. 80 mm 2 /s, and a pour point of- 22 o C.

Cranberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> has shown to be an optimal cold-pressed edible <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> due to its ideally balanced 1 : 1 ratio of omega- 6 to omega- 3 fatty acids, high levels of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, low levels of saturated fatty acids, phospholipids, phytosterols, and {{a high concentration of}} antioxidants.

A sharp variation of viscosity is only observed for alkyd resins having more than 40 % (w/w) of karawila <b>seed</b> <b>oil.</b> The polyesterification time was reduced and correspondingly the extent of polymerization was also reduced up to 30 % (w/w).
