The defense questioned her identification of her son in the casket in Chicago and a $400 life insurance policy she had taken out on him.|$|E

She then becomes concerned over Vicki's much older boyfriend Tommy Grant (Robert Cavanah), and exposes him as a liar. At this point, Den returns intent on securing her forgiveness. However, she does not succumb to his charm offensive, and so as a demonstration of his affection he confides in her of his plans to bankrupt the Mitchell family and take control of The Queen Victoria public house, declaring that he can't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> her. She relents, but warns if he ever cheats again she will kill him. Together, they scam the Mitchell family out of their holdings and move into the Vic on Christmas Day, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) {{has been}} taken to a disused medical {{facility}} by David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) and his agents. She {{is placed in the}} same room along with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), also secured to a chair, revealing she was also abducted by Jones the night before. Jones arrives and asserts that Olivia has great abilities due to her Cortexiphan doping but he must coax them out of Olivia. He presents a light box test that Olivia should be able to activate with her mind, torturing Nina to create the emotional driver, but Olivia admits she can't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> rest. During this period, Olivia, her memories a mix of her own and that of Olivia from Peter Bishop's (Joshua Jackson) timeline, asks Nina to help her make an emotional connection, but she recognizes that this Nina is not the real one but instead the one from the parallel universe. Olivia continues to play along, explaining to Nina that her Cortexiphan abilities could only be induced by being near Peter; Nina fakes illness to be extracted from the room, where she explains to a complicit Jones that they need to abduct Peter.|$|E

25|$|These {{goals for}} {{structural}} change could have improved {{the efficiency of}} resource allocation while doing {{a great deal to}} lessen poverty. But the goals clearly required both time and the ability to restore expansion without worsening inflation and external deficits. The government initially emphasized such macroeconomic objectives as necessary conditions for the structural changes. The first step was to stop the built-in inflationary process, but to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> adopting orthodox measures of monetary and fiscal restraint.|$|E

He never made himself available to do this album, and so it's always my belief that the thing must keep moving; I had to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> him."

500|$|Chaiken also didn't want {{to portray}} Jenny's ordeal in an {{explicit}} manner, confirming this she said: [...] "I am loath to portray rape as a filmmaker. I {{think it is}} really hard to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> somehow becoming complicit and exploitative. And so as much as it's important to talk about it, I wanted to be vague and not milk it." [...] Chaiken has also admitted {{that the use of}} dream sequences involving Jenny were not a successful inclusion, but claimed it was necessary to portray Jenny coming to terms with her abuse. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen criticized the storyline because there was no conclusion to it, also stating it was never explored enough, leading everyone to think she was just a jerk.|$|E
500|$|Following Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na, Khan {{starred in}} Sanjay Gadhvi's thriller Kidnap. He was cast as Kabir Sharma, a {{kidnapper}} who abducts {{a girl to}} settle an old score with her father, played by Minissha Lamba and Sanjay Dutt, respectively. The actor was initially hesitant to play the part (calling it [...] "tricky and tough") because he couldn't relate to the character; according to him, {{he would not have}} been able to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> Gadhvi's support and backing. In preparation for his role, Khan listened to metal and rock music for a year to become aggressive. While the film was a critical failure, his performance was generally well received by critics. Gaurav Malani, in a review for The Economic Times, wrote: [...] "Imran Khan is effective as the intelligent abductor who's always two steps ahead of his opponent. However, the natural actor could go easy on his lip movements that appear synthetic at times." [...] Kidnap was also a commercial failure.|$|E

He said Linkin Park was still making a concept record, stating in another interview with MTV, [...] "we might need to just make a record and still try to do a concept but {{figure out a way}} to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> actually waiting another five or six years to put out a record, to try to pull off all the grandiose insanity we were thinking of doing.

500|$|The {{release of}} Lizard {{merchandise}} designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape {{with a layer}} of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics. Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more [...] "Steve Ditko derived" [...] (the character's original artist). Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling. He stated [...] "that in a comic book, you just put that thing up there, and you can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when you try to do that and make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{impeachment}} trial of President Andrew Johnson, Morton {{voted in favor}} of conviction, as did most moderate and all Radical Republicans, and openly voiced his disappointment at Johnson's acquittal. Although Morton delivered a speech in the fall of 1865 arguing that the recently freed slaves were unready for the vote, and once worked to end Indiana's so-called [...] "Black Laws" [...] that restricted blacks' basic civil rights, and the state constitutional provision forbidding their entry into the state, he reversed his position after the war. By 1866 Morton had come to share the general Republican belief that the only means of guaranteeing loyalty to governments protective of black civil rights must be through giving adult males of every race the franchise. As he explained, [...] "I confess, and I <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> shame, that I have been educated by the great events of War." [...] He championed the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, and when the Democrats began to resign en masse from the Senate during its debate to prevent a quorum, Morton engineered a maneuver that kept the bill in the docket and allowed it to be passed.|$|E

500|$|A fourth 1928 novel, Ladies Almanack by the American writer Djuna Barnes, {{not only}} {{contains}} a character based on Radclyffe Hall but includes passages {{that may be}} a response to The Well. Ladies Almanack is a roman à clef of a lesbian literary and artistic circle in Paris, written in an archaic, Rabelaisian style and starring Natalie Barney as Dame Evangeline Musset. Much as Sir Phillip paces his study worrying about Stephen, Dame Musset's father [...] "pac his library in the most normal of Night-Shirts". When, unlike Sir Phillip, he confronts his daughter, she replies confidently: [...] "Thou, good Governor, wast expecting a Son when you lay atop of your Choosing... Am I not doing after your very Desire, and is it not the more commendable, seeing that I <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> the Tools for the Trade, and yet nothing complain?" [...] Ladies Almanack is far more overtly sexual than The Well; its cryptic style, full of in-jokes and ornate language, may have been intended to disguise its content from censors. It could not in any case be prosecuted by the Home Office, since it was published only in France, in a small, privately printed edition. It did not become widely available until 1972.|$|E
