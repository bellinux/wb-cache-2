We consider whether there is anything special about NIPD that could sanction a change to consent procedures for prenatal diagnosis or otherwise render informed decision-making less important. We accept the claim that the absence of risk of miscarriage to some extent lessens the gravity of the decision to test compared with invasive methods of testing. However, we also claim that the <b>definitive</b> <b>nature</b> of the information received, {{and the fact that the}} information can lead to decisions of great significance, makes NIPD an important choice. This choice should only be made by means of a rigorous and appropriately supported decision-making process (assuming that this is what the pregnant woman wants).

The process of BIM involves building industry professionals and client users groups using available 3 D applications and other digital media for synchronized and continuous data sharing. The BIM process includes all cooperative actions among these professionals in a design project.

Investigation of the environment of healthcare facilities reveals some level of evidence concerning the affect of atmosphere on the wellness of patients, caregivers and other user groups. At this time, the available credible reports supporting evidence for improving the healing environment is developing. Implementing BIM for healthcare projects is a liaison in the pursuit of Evidence-based design (EBD). The availability of solid data contributes to EBD in reaching an ideal for designing healthcare facilities. Exploring the relationship between the BIM process and the nature of Healthcare design reveals connections between the sharing of information and the gathering of information as a large contributor for the pursuit of healing environments, leading to overall advancements in healthcare design. For this research, a case study of a design for a healthcare facility project is reviewed in its traditional process. Adopting the design project with application of a BIM process of design, rather than the traditional process, establishes a level of comparison highlighting the results of BIM in healthcare design. With regards to critical aspects in the nature of healthcare BIM strategies are utilized for the investigation of the case study project.

Glucose transporter isoform 4, or GLUT 4, is expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues and is responsible for postprandial blood glucose clearance. The mechanistic dissection of GLUT 4 regulation is crucial for our understanding of the molecular nature of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. Unlike most other glucose transporters, GLUT 4 is compartmentalized inside the cell primarily in small insulin-responsive-vesicles, or IRVs, that are translocated to the cell surface upon insulin stimulation. From the plasma membrane, GLUT 4 is internalized and is rapidly delivered to a sub-domain of either the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or recycling endosomes that represent the donor compartment for the formation of the IRVs. Such a complicated pattern of intracellular trafficking is apparently defined by unique signals in the GLUT 4 molecule. Previous studies have suggested that sequences in the cytoplasmic tails of GLUT 4 are important for its faithful intracellular localization. However, the <b>definitive</b> <b>nature</b> of signals that target GLUT 4 specifically to the IRVs is still not clear. In this study, the targeting role of the first luminal loop of GLUT 4 was explored by exchanging the first luminal loop of GLUT 4 with the corresponding region of cellugyrin, a 4 -transmembrane protein that is absent from the IRVs. Using fluorescence microscopy and biochemical fractionation, it was determined that the first luminal loop of GLUT 4 is sufficient to confer insulin responsiveness to cellugyrin. Mechanistically, the first luminal loop of GLUT 4 targets the reporter protein to the IRVs by interacting with the sorting receptor sortilin. A model is proposed in which targeting of GLUT 4 into the IRVs requires at least two distinct steps: targeting into the donor compartment (TGN and/or recycling endosomes) provided by sequences in the cytoplasmic tail and targeting from the donor compartment into the IRVs that depends on the first luminal loop of the transporter...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{influences}} {{of different types of}} interpersonal trust {{on the development of the}} business enterprise, and builds in part on the author's MSc dissertation, which found interpersonal trust to play a key pert in the decision making process. A key feature of the research is a focus on the notion of becoming, rather than that of being; of change over static presence. The research acknowledges the basic truth of the statement 'only perception gives knowledge of things' and therefore adopts a broadly interpretative approach throughout. This is in keeping with the subjective nature of the trust concept. The thesis discusses the nature of trust from a primarily sociological standpoint and develops its models mainly from discussions of trust in the management and organization literature. The field studies, while conforming to these epistemological and ontological presuppositions, utilise three different methods: semi-structured, taped interviews; longitudinal participant observation case study; and verbal protocol analysis, in order to apply and refine the theory of trust developed and thereby come to an understanding of the role and importance of interpersonal trust in the business enterprise. The thesis finds that interpersonal situational trust is central to small business development, and may be usefully construed as an a posteriori tacit knowledge which the trusting party uses in order to fill gaps in his explicit knowledge of a situation, thereby reducing its complexity and enabling cooperation. The link between trust and co-operation is teased out, and it is suggested that trust overcomes an individual's co-operation threshold for a situation, as determined by a set of identifiable co-operation criteria, enabling co-operative behaviour on the part of the individual. The combination of co-operation threshold and trust level outcomes for each of the individuals in the situation is thus said to determine whether or not co-operation occurs between them. It is argued, therefore, that trust is a prerequisite for co-operation, and that the stronger, more resilient the situational trust, the more likely it is that cooperation will occur. The thesis finds that a useful distinction may be drawn between trust which is based on familiarity with the trusted party and trust which is based on familiarity with the situation in which the trusting interaction occurs. It finds that the development of the latter type, termed Comprehensible Situational Cue Reliance-Based Trust is perhaps of most importance with regard to the effect of trust on business development. The thesis applies a process theory derived from the work of the metaphysician Alfred North Whitehead to the theory of trust which it utilises, and finds that interpersonal situational trust may be considered as 'an actual occasion in concrescence', thereby offering the potential for a philosophical reconceptualisation of trust in terms of a process metaphysic, instead of the more static philosophical presuppositions which have historically tended to underpin its theoretical development. The thesis concludes by suggesting that trust is the medium through which the entrepreneur is able to create and extract value from the environment, emphasises the indicative (as opposed to <b>definitive)</b> <b>nature</b> of its exploration, and identifies a number of areas for further research, including matched international comparisons of businesses in order to verify the applicability of the theories and models which it develops...|$|E

Introduction: Approximately one in three Americans suffer from hypertension (HTN), which is the most common risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease such as heart attack, heart failure and stroke. The pathophysiology behind the development of the disease, while multifactorial, is thought to stem primarily from genetic and behavioral factors such as diet and lack of exercise. Antihypertensive medication {{has been shown to be}} effective in lowering blood pressure and circumventing the incidence of development of heart disease, but remains ineffective against the non-compliant behavior of patients. Failure to comply with, or adhere to, a physician's medication regimen opens the patients to an increased risk of uncontrolled blood pressure and the development of heart disease. Unfortunately, it is far too common of a problem as it is estimated that over half of patients do not take antihypertensive medication. Reasons for non-compliant behavior include: the adverse side effects of medication, the prescription of more than one type of medication, the desire to not remain on medication for a long period of time and a preference for alternative treatments to pharmacological therapy. Non-compliance is also associated with race and age, as individuals who are African-American and younger than seventy five appear to be at an increased risk. It is thought that the reason African-Americans are more non-compliant has to due with the fear of losing their culture, as changing of their diet would equate to abandoning who they are. The United States Virgin Islands (USVI), an American territory with a population of mainly African descent, has a unique and distinct culture. Few studies have been done evaluating the contribution of cultural and behavioral practices on non-compliant behavior with medication within this population, and to date, no data is available on compliance and HTN. Methods: Forty-four hypertensive patients prescribed medication by a physician, were interviewed on cultural and behavioral practices on St. Croix, one island of the USVI. Patients were asked whether or not they took their medication as prescribed by a physician and were grouped according to compliance. Non-compliant and compliant patients were then compared on age, salt intake, use of herbal reh 1 edies for HTN, presence of co-morbidities and trust of pharmacological treatments. Patients were then divided based on whether or not they had heart disease and if they used herbal medication. Analyses were carried out using chi-square analysis and Fisher's exact test where applicable. Results: Out of the forty four patients, fifteen admitted to being non-compliant with their medication. There were no statistically significant differences between the compliance groups except with salt intake and trust of pharmacological medication. There was a marginally significant, but inconclusive, difference in relation to presence of other co-morbidities. Herbal medication use was found in both compliance groups. Discussion: Admitted non-compliance within the population of this study was around thirty four percent. Both participant groups, compliant and non-compliant, had individuals who used herbal remedies. Use of herbs, such as pomegranate, cattle's tongue and hawthorn, were viewed by some as more natural than pharmacological medication. Side effects associated with antihypertensive medication were the most common reason cited by patients for distrust of prescription medication. The significance of salt intake between compliant and non-compliant patients can be looked at from two perspectives. Compliant patients may be more inclined to give up salt because they may care more about the effect of salt on their health, or the behavior of non-compliant patients may be suggestive of the difficulty of giving up salt because of its use in cultural dishes. Future research with a larger population size should be conducted to look into the <b>definitive</b> <b>nature</b> culture has on behavioral and medicinal compliance within the USVI...|$|E
40|$|As {{mobile phone}} {{connections}} approach two billion worldwide and become steadily more available and affordable, demands for scientific {{studies on the}} effect of such EMFs on human functioning similarly increase. The current thesis systematically investigated the effects of acute mobile phone exposure on human brain activity and performance using an in-vivo approach. The research question comprised the following parts: First, is human neural function sensitive to acute mobile phone exposure? Second, if so, what processes are affected? Third, if so, do these neural changes affect gross measures of performance or behaviour? A review of the previous literature found that there was some, but not conclusive evidence that mobile phone exposure affects neural function and some aspects of human performance, and that the studies in question required replication with reliable and realistic dosimetry, double-blinding and additional technical tests to ensure that the experimental set-up was free of artefact contamination. A pilot study was conducted to provide an indication of possible future results, assist in the formation of hypotheses for the main study, and highlight what technical issues required attention before the main study could begin. Results of the pilot study indicated that EMFs emitted by GSM 900 mobile phones may alter human brain activity during an auditory task, particularly in proximity to the phone. Both early sensory and later more cognitive ERP components were significantly altered during active compared to sham exposure. Results also suggested that mobile phone exposure may hinder human performance, with longer RTs during the active exposure relative to the sham exposure. However, due to the small sample size of the pilot investigation and questions remaining as to possible technical limitations of the study, these results were treated with caution and used primarily in the formation of future hypotheses for the larger experimental study. Subsequent technical tests provided improvement and validation of the experimental set-up and exposure delivery system, and ensured that future research would be free from such technical limitations. These tests included the characterisation of spectral emissions by the test phone; ensuring that EMFs emitted by the test phones would not interfere with, nor distort, data from the response pad or that processed by the electrode leads; determining whether electrode leads cause an increase or decrease in SAR; and examining the issue of experimenter interference. These tests enabled the conclusion that a positive finding from the large experimental trial would be due to the active exposure of the mobile phone, {{or in the case of}} a null finding, would not be due to insufficient or unreliable exposure. Applying the knowledge gained from these technical tests, the main study aimed to provide results of a <b>definitive</b> <b>nature</b> by employing a sample size of 120 sufficient statistical power to detect relatively subtle effects, and a stringent methodological design to account for past limitations. The main study also increased the scope of investigation beyond that achieved in previous research by including endpoints related to sensory processing (auditory and visual tasks), higher cognitive processing (cardsorting task), performance (reaction time and accuracy) and cortical activation (EEG alpha power). To increase this scope even further, within these tasks, the study used data from each scalp electrode and offered insights into the effect of laterality (ipsi- versus contralateral in relation to the exposure source), psychological arousal, perception of transmission, and between-subject factors such as age, gender, previous mobile phone use and hemisphere exposed (right versus left hemisphere exposure). The results of the main study suggested that acute exposure to GSM 900 mobile phone significantly reduced levels of psychological arousal, particularly in relation to selfratings of Energy. Results also indicated that only minutes of active exposure can lead to enhanced alpha EEG activity during active exposure relative to sham exposure. Interestingly, this effect was found to be transient, decreasing below sham levels after ten minutes of active exposure and up until ten minutes after exposure cessation. These exposure-induced changes in EEG alpha power were here interpreted as representing an overall reduction in integrative brain function, possibly caused by the physiological response to neural interference or altered synaptic transmission. Acute exposure did not alter human brain activity in the form of the early sensory or later cognitive ERP responses during an auditory or visual task, or EEG synchronisation during a higher cognitive task. The findings also suggested that resultant behaviour, as indexed by RT and accuracy, is unaffected by exposure. Conversely, exploration into specific groups within the sample resulted in some interesting interactions, which raised the possibility that active mobile phone exposure may affect individuals differently as a function of age, gender and which hemisphere is exposed. Specifically, the auditory processing of older individuals was particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of mobile phone exposure compared to their younger counterparts. Results of the visual task suggested that the performance of females may also be particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of active exposure, compared to males. Overall, the present study has confirmed that there are mobile phone-related bioeffects at the low levels that mobile phones are permitted to operate at. Although various effects have been observed, there is no indication from the present results that cumulative effects or any health consequences exist as this was not the focus of the research. It is argued that future investigation into mobile phone-related bioeffects should apply more sophisticated methodologies to the investigation of acute exposure on EEG alpha power and higher cognitive functioning, as well as larger sample sizes and fewer carefully planned comparisons in order to detect small effects. Further investigation into exposure-induced effects on different groups according to age, gender and which hemisphere is exposed should also be a priority...|$|E

Matches version {{submitted to}} ApJInternational audienceThe detection of the afterglow emission and host galaxies of short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) {{is one of}} the most exciting recent astronomical discoveries. Indications that SHB progenitors belong to old stellar populations, in contrast to those of the long-soft GRBs, provide a strong clue about their physical <b>nature.</b> <b>Definitive</b> conclusions however are limited by the small number of SHBs with known hosts. Here, we present our investigation of SHBs previously localized by the interplanetary network (IPN) using new and archival optical and X-ray observations. We show that we can likely identify the host galaxies/clusters for additional two bursts, significantly increasing the sample of SHBs with known hosts and/or distances. In particular, we determine that the bright SHB 790613 occurred within the rich galaxy cluster Abell 1892, making it probably the nearest SHB currently known. We show that the brightest galaxy within the error box of SHB 000607, at z= 0. 14, is most likely the host galaxy of this event. Additionally, we rule out the existence of galaxy overdensities (down to ~ 21 mag) near the locations of two other SHBs, and set a lower limit on their probable redshift. We combine our SHB sample with events discovered recently by the Swift and HETE- 2 missions, and investigate the properties of the extended sample. Comparison to SNe Ia shows that the progenitors of SHBs are typically older, implying a typical life time of several Gy. We also show that it is unlikely that there is a significant population of progenitors with life time shorter than 1 Gy. This result disfavors the popular model of NS-NS mergers as the progenitors of SHBs...|$|R
40|$|To {{question}} {{the role of}} nature and virtue in The Theory of Moral Sentiments is to question Adam Smith's reliance on the classical authors who integrated a concept of nature into their teaching on moral virtue. Given that Smith was well versed in the classics and was a scholar of both Greek and Latin (Stewart, [1793] 1982, p. 10; Smith, [1759] 1984, Introduction, p. 5; Foley, 1974, p. 220; Vivenza, 2001, p. 36), {{it is not surprising}} that he refers to Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics in The Theory of Moral Sentiments. What is surprising is the quite brief treatment that he gives to them; in particular to Aristotle, whose doctrine of moral and intellectual virtue depends upon <b>definitive</b> concepts of <b>nature</b> and human nature. Why does Smith treat Aristotle in this manner? Is his reference to Aristotle's doctrine a means to an end, a device chosen to lend authority to his own (McNamara, 2004, p. 185) ? Is it an example of the 'indirect' influence of the classics on Smith (Vivenza, 2001, p. 2) ? Could it be that Smith is presenting a radical theory with no foundation in a theory of human nature (Rothschild, 2004, p. 116) ? Finally, could it be that Smith, as he asserts, adopts wholly, or in part, Aristotle's concept of nature and thereby implies correspondence of his teaching with it? The purpose of this chapter is to seek answers to such questions by comparing the relationship between nature and virtue in The Theory of Moral Sentiments with that evident in Aristotle. While important, Smith's treatment of Plato and the Stoics is not addressed...|$|R

Razumijevajući osnovnoškolske popise lektire kao lektirni kanon, autorica se bavi formom i formiranjem tog kanona. Gotovo stoljetnu (pre) tvorbu lektirnog kanona u Hrvatskoj rekonstruira i interpretira u kontekstu ekonomskih (nakladničkih, knjižarskih) i ideoloških (političkih, znanstvenih i dobnih) silnica. Through {{an insight}} into the {{processes}} of institutionalisation of elementary school readings lists in Croatia, an examination is made in this article of the rule accepted in literature on {{the relation between the}} literary canon and the list of assigned texts that are read as part of elementary education. Since the elementary school reading lists – in force in Croatia on the basis of teaching plans and programmes – also have the characteristics of lists and canons, they are called the assigned reading canon in this paper. The central part of the article deals with the form and formation of that canon, the level of its imaginary, <b>definitive</b> and conclusive <b>nature,</b> its orientation towards children 2 ̆ 7 s literature and its debatable canonical effect. The almost century-long (trans) formation of the assigned reading canon is reconstructed and interpreted in the context of economic (in publisher and bookshop terms) and ideological (political, scholarly and age-group) forces. In this, the observed discrepancy between elementary school reading lists and reading lists at other levels of the study and evaluation of literature is interpreted in the concluding part of the article in relation to the marginal position of children 2 ̆ 7 s literature in literary scholarship and to the ambivalent meaning and value that contemporary society attaches to the concept of childhood...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of the afterglow emission and host galaxies of short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) {{is one of}} the most exciting recent astronomical discoveries. Indications that SHB progenitors belong to old stellar populations, in contrast to those of the long-soft GRBs, provide a strong clue about their physical <b>nature.</b> <b>Definitive</b> conclusions however are limited by the small number of SHBs with known hosts. Here, we present our investigation of SHBs previously localized by the interplanetary network (IPN) using new and archival optical and X-ray observations. We show that we can likely identify the host galaxies/clusters for additional two bursts, significantly increasing the sample of SHBs with known hosts and/or distances. In particular, we determine that the bright SHB 790613 occurred within the rich galaxy cluster Abell 1892, making it probably the nearest SHB currently known. We show that the brightest galaxy within the error box of SHB 000607, at z= 0. 14, is most likely the host galaxy of this event. Additionally, we rule out the existence of galaxy overdensities (down to ~ 21 mag) near the locations of two other SHBs, and set a lower limit on their probable redshift.

5000|$|Hardin is {{the author}} of 9 books and over 500 {{published}} magazine articles. He began his writing career as a young runaway from military school in the 1960s, publishing short pieces and poems in alternative periodicals including Win, The Guardian and Communities. For the first 30 years wrote in wild nature and personal growth, responsibility and activism in self-help, alternative spirituality and ecology oriented publications such as Mother Earth News, The Trumpeter, Green Egg, Sowell Review, Sentient Times, Creations, New Thought Journal, Hight Country News, Magical Blend and Natural Beauty & Health. His coining of the word [...] "Rewilding" [...] - and writings on personal as well as ecological rewilding - are considered seminal to the budding Neoprimitivist and Wildcrafting communities. The word ReWilding was first coined by Animá teacher and author Jesse Wolf Hardin under the pen name Lone Wolf Circles in 1986, and was meant to refer to personal rewilding (primal awareness, meeting one's needs, acting not out of obedience but personal responsibility) as well as wilderness restoration. It first saw print in his article by that name in July 1988, in the premier issue of a zine published by an insurgent group of disgruntled Earth First! activists, and again in 1996 in the May/June and July/August issues of Oberon Zell-Ravenheart's nationally distributed Green Egg Magazine. Both of Hardin's published references appear to predate use of the word [...] "Rewilding" [...] by both conservationists (such as Dave Foreman and his Rewilding Institute) and anarchist groups. (See also ReWilding entry in The Encyclopedia of Religion of Nature, published by Thoemmes Continuum in 2005.) As his understandings evolved, he began expanding his efforts to reach a wider audience, from literary works for the more conservative readers of Gray's Sporting Journal, to academic and practitioner entries for the <b>definitive</b> Encyclopedia of <b>Nature</b> & Religion.|$|R
40|$|The safety signal {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} during the absence of stimuli predicting impending shock, the organism is not fearful. The stimuli which predict the absence of shock are therefore called safety signals. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate some critical properties of safety signals. Such stimuli in an avoidance or escape situation, according to the opponent process model, are expected to acquire hedonic value opposite to shock. This study examined differences in conditioning variables between safety signals predicting different intensities of shock, and between safety signals present in procedures using predicted shock, and procedures using unpredicted shock. Additionally, the effects of inescapable unpredicted shock with no safety signals present were examined. The general procedure involved exposing pigeons to aversive Pavlovian conditioning and subsequently autoshaping these birds to stimuli which had predicted safety in the aversive situation. Dependent measures included trials to acquisition of the autoshaped response and subsequent rate of keypecking. In the six experimental groups, pigeons were repeatedly and inescapably shocked at either 30 or 90 volts. Each individual 0. 5 sec shock was (a) predicted by a specific stimulus or (b) not predicted. Additionally and explicitly unpaired with the shock, a safety signal was presented. For each voltage level, a control group was repeatedly shocked with no stimuli presented at any time. Control groups were included which (a) received no aversive conditioning, (b) were autoshaped to a stimulus which had previously predicted shock, (c) received the aversive conditioning, and (4) were exposed to various stimuli but received no aversive reinforcement. The principal finding was that preexposure to strong shock resulted in delays in response acquisition during subsequent autoshaping. This suggests that the learned helplessness hypothesis obtains with classically conditioned responding. Additionally, the importance of shock-alone control groups in the study of transfer effects is critical. Due to the lack of statistical power, the study was not <b>definitive</b> regarding the <b>nature</b> of safety signals or appetitive-to-appetitive transfers. Statistically significant differences were only found on acquisition measures, and no such differences were found on performance measures...|$|R
