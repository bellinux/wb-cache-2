40|$|There are {{two types}} of {{electric}} crossing : i) subterranean / submarine line ii) overhead-line crossing. We always consider the last one as a more economic option. The inconvenience of an overhead-line crossing would be the environmental constraints among which the existing obstacles, the clearance for the navigation and the aesthetics demanded by the public. The overhead-line crossings usually have conductors of long ranges which are outside of the field of application for the current transmission line codes. These are limited to reaches of a length included between 200 m and 800 m, as well as a height of support lower than 60 m. However, for reaches over 800 m and over a height over 60 m, the criteria of conception in the transmission line codes for the calculation of wind loads are not applicable. In this study we concentrate on loads on the supports owed to the limit wind applied to bare conductors and <b>insulators</b> <b>chains</b> The objective of the present study is to examine the effect of the temporal and spatial correlation of the wind load along the conductors on a finite element model. A special attention was brought to the evaluation {{of the importance of the}} dynamic load transmitted on by the conductors and the <b>insulators</b> <b>chains</b> for the case of a turbulent wind load. The numerical study on finite element model for the example of a overhead-line crossing was done with the software ADINA. The wind load for the finite element model for the example of a overhead-line crossing was generated by the software WindGen which uses the method of Simiu-Scanlan and the method of spectral representation developed by Shinozuka-Deodatis. Wind loads generated where integrated into the finite element model ADINA for a dynamic analysis of the overhead-line crossing. For the first part, the current methods are used to calculate the efforts in supports due to the wind loads with an engineering approach and a comparaison approach. The current methods are then compared with the efforts obtained from an advanced method, transient dynamic and spectral stochastic, and specifically for the case of a simple overhead-line and an overhead-line crossings. For the second part, the effect of the longitudinal correlation of the wind load on two parallel conductors was examined. Finally, dynamic experiments on an <b>insulators</b> <b>chain</b> were made to determine the variation of the damping and the rigidity of the system for different type of insulators, different speed of application of the load and the inclination of the insulator...|$|R
40|$|Galloping of {{high voltage}} {{electric}} cables {{is one of}} serious problems during witer time. Since ice block along the cable works like wing for lift under the strong wind, self-excited vibration will be caused into galloping of cables. To lower the cost for electric transportation, researching for dumping method for galloping phenomena is important subjects. In this study we propose zaile method, connecting flux of cables with <b>insulator</b> <b>chains,</b> to lower vibration of cables. Models experiments for dumping effect of galloping have been done, with several zaile patterns. From the results, to reduce vibration, connection in vertical direction {{is the most effective}} one. Since with the zaile connection, vibration dumping was five times smaller than free galloping, it has been proved that zaile method is effective to reduce galloping vibration...|$|R
40|$|We {{report an}} {{experimental}} study of, a Mott <b>insulator</b> containing <b>chains</b> of edge-sharing CuO_ 4 plaquettes, by polarized x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), resonant magnetic x-ray scattering (RMXS), magnetic susceptibility, and pyroelectric current measurements. The XAS {{data show that}} the valence holes reside exclusively on the Cu^ 2 + sites within the copper-oxide spin chains and populate a d-orbital polarized within the CuO_ 4 plaquettes. The RMXS measurements confirm the presence of incommensurate magnetic order below a Néel temperature of T_N = 11. 5 K, which was previously inferred from neutron powder diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance data. In conjunction with the magnetic susceptibility and XAS data, they also demonstrate a new "orbital" selection rule for RMXS that is of general relevance for magnetic structure determinations by this technique. Dielectric property measurements reveal the absence of significant ferroelectric polarization below T_N, which is in striking contrast to corresponding observations on the isostructural compound. The results {{are discussed in the}} context of current theories of multiferroicity. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|We solve {{exactly a}} {{multiband}} one-dimensional Jahn-Teller (JT) model with strong electron correlations using the Lieb-Wu Bethe ansatz equations. As {{well as the}} metallic undistorted phase, we find two JT distorted phases. The first is a conducting phase, in which most carriers sit on one chain with the remaining carriers distributed equally among the other chains. We suggest that this phase is what is observed at low temperatures in Yb 4 As 3 In the second phase all the carriers sit on one chain. This phase becomes a Mott <b>insulator</b> when the <b>chain</b> is half filled. We also show that a mean-field treatment of the model is misleading and that an exact treatment of interactions is essential...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Nanowires {{have been an}} active field of study since last decade. The reduced {{dimensionality}} end size allowing electrons can propagate only in one direction has led to quantization which are rather different from the bulk structure. As a result, nanowires having cross section {{in the range of}} Broglie wavelength have shown stepwise electrical and thermal conductance, giant Young modulus, stepwise variation of the cross-section etc. Moreover, the atomic structure of nanowires have exhibited interesting regularities which are not known in two or three dimensions. These novel properties of nanowires have been actively explored since last decade in order to find an application in the rapidly developing field of nanotechnology. In the present thesis, we investigated the atomic and electronic structure of a variety of Si and C atom based very thin nanowires starting from linear chain including pentagonal, hexagonal and tubular structures. We found that the C and Si linear chains form double bonds and have high binding energy. Although bulk carbon in diamond structure is an <b>insulator,</b> carbon linear <b>chain</b> is metal and has twice conductance of the gold chain. We carried out an extensive analysis of stability and conductance of the other wires. Our study reveals that Si and C based nanowires generally show metallic properties {{in spite of the fact}} that they are insulator or semiconductor when they are in bulk crystal structure. Metallicity occurs due to change in the character and order of bonds. Tongay, SefaattinM. S...|$|R
