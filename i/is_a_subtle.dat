5|$|At first glance, all the Buddha statues appear similar, {{but there}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> {{difference}} between them in the mudras, or {{the position of the}} hands. There are five groups of mudra: North, East, South, West and Zenith, which represent the five cardinal compass points according to Mahayana. The first four balustrades have the first four mudras: North, East, South and West, of which the Buddha statues that face one compass direction have the corresponding mudra. Buddha statues at the fifth balustrades and inside the 72 stupas on the top platform have the same mudra: Zenith. Each mudra represents one of the Five Dhyani Buddhas; each has its own symbolism.|$|E
25|$|As {{has been}} {{discussed}} above, although the distinction between a symmetric operator and a self-adjoint (or essentially self-adjoint) operator <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> one, it is important since self-adjointness is the hypothesis in the spectral theorem. Here we discuss some concrete examples of the distinction; see the section below on extensions of symmetric operators for the general theory.|$|E
25|$|There are fringe {{analyses}} relating {{this number}} change to rumors that Kubrick faked the first moon landing, {{as there are}} approximately 237,000 miles between Earth and Moon (average is 238,855 miles) and the movie <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> confession of his involvement. Another theory is an obsession with the number 42 and its forms in the movie and {{the product of the}} digits in 237 is 42.|$|E

50|$|The Blue Cliff Record <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> and {{literary}} text, with wide-ranging philosophical implications, as opposed for example {{to the more}} straightforward nature of The Gateless Gate.|$|R
25|$|Covert {{redirect}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> {{method to}} perform phishing attacks that makes links appear legitimate, but actually redirect a victim to an attacker's website. The flaw is usually masqueraded under a log-in popup {{based on an}} affected site's domain. It can affect OAuth 2.0 and OpenID based on well-known exploit parameters as well. This often makes use of open redirect and XSS vulnerabilities in the third-party application websites.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of multiple distinct cultures in Spain allows an analogy {{to be drawn}} to the United Kingdom. Using the term Spanish for someone of Spanish descent would then {{be expected to be}} equivalent to using Briton to describe someone descending from some part of the United Kingdom. Cultures within the United Kingdom, such as English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh, would then correspond in this analogy to cultures within Spain such as Castilian, Catalan, Galician and Basque among others. In contrast with Spain, because of centuries of gradual and mutual consolidation across the Iberian Peninsula, such distinctions tend to be blurred. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle,</b> yet important, distinction.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} Thebaid, Statius' {{relationship}} to Domitian and his court {{caused him to}} fall out of favor with critics and readers, but in recent times, the Silvae have been rehabilitated by scholars. Domitian is an important presence in the Silvae, and many of the poems appear to flatter the emperor and court. The content of the Silvae is primarily dictated by the needs of Statius' patrons, and many of the addressees come from the wealthy, privileged class of landowners and politicians. Statius' flattery of these elites has been interpreted in two ways by scholars; some maintain that the collection is highly subversive and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> criticism of Domitian and the Roman aristocracy. Others urge a reading of the Silvae as individual pieces that respond to specific circumstances with their own unique viewpoints.|$|E
50|$|Most deciphered messages, {{often about}} {{relative}} trivia, were insufficient as intelligence reports for military strategists or field commanders. The organisation, interpretation {{and distribution of}} decrypted Enigma message traffic and other sources into usable intelligence <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> task.|$|R

5000|$|A {{small number}} of verbs, {{including}} some already mentioned above, can in fact be found with either auxiliary ( [...] , , , , , , [...] ). There may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> change of meaning depending on the auxiliary chosen, and one auxiliary is usually more literary or archaic than the other.|$|R
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> {{difference}} or {{distinction between}} {{these two types of}} simultaneity Gleizes describes that deserve closer attention: inscribed onto the canvas could be either (1) the properties of two or more instantiations or physical occurrence happening at the same time {{from the point of view}} of one frame of reference (the artist fixed in one position), or (2) the artist could inscribe (paint) the properties of one event represented over a succession of time intervals, observed from several frame of reference (or multiple points of view simultaneously expressed onto the canvas), meaning that the observational reference frame is tied to the state of motion of an observer. There are shared variables between the two concepts, involving the flow of time, i.e., temporal in nature, and involving motion (on the part of either the artist or subject), spatial in nature.|$|E
25|$|The central {{garden was}} {{redesigned}} by Kim Wilkie and opened as the John Madejski Garden on 5 July 2005. The design <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> blend {{of the traditional}} and modern: the layout is formal; there is an elliptical water feature lined in stone with steps around the edge which may be drained to use the area for receptions, gatherings or exhibition purposes. This {{is in front of}} the bronze doors leading to the refreshment rooms. A central path flanked by lawns leads to the sculpture gallery. The north, east and west sides have herbaceous borders along the museum walls with paths in front which continues along the south façade. In the two corners by the north façade there is planted an American Sweetgum tree. The southern, eastern and western edges of the lawns have glass planters which contain orange and lemon trees in summer, which are replaced by bay trees in winter.|$|E
25|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the Kapala stingaree {{is more or}} less diamond-shaped with rounded outer corners and posterior margins, and is slightly wider than long. The leading margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at an obtuse angle on the fleshy, barely protruding snout. The eyes are of modest size and followed by teardrop-shaped spiracles with rounded posterior rims. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> knob on the rear margin of each nostril. Between the nostrils is a bell-shaped curtain of skin, with the posterior margin shallowly fringed and corners elongated into lobes; only the sparsely-spotted stingaree (U. paucimaculatus) has a similarly shaped nasal curtain. The mouth is small and contains 57 papillae (nipple-like structure) arranged in a W-shaped pattern on the floor. The lower jaw also bears a patch of prominent papillae, arranged to form a series of transverse ridges. The teeth have rhomboid bases and are arranged in a quincunx pattern; the crowns are blunt for teeth at the sides of the jaws, becoming higher and more pointed towards the middle of the jaw. There are 25 upper and 3132 lower tooth rows. The five pairs of gill slits are S-shaped. The pelvic fins are small with rounded rear margins; males have short, stout claspers.|$|E

5000|$|Dysplastic nails <b>are</b> <b>a</b> {{cutaneous}} condition, and may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> {{finding of}} ridging, flaking, or poor {{growth of the}} nails, or more diffuse with nearly complete loss of nails. [...] This condition may <b>be</b> seen in <b>a</b> number of syndromes, including Dyskeratosis congenita and Nail-patella syndrome.|$|R
50|$|Prevost's landscapes <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle,</b> {{and rather}} {{idiosyncratic}} {{mix of the}} documentary and aesthetic traditions. Aside from a show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2003, his work has gone largely unknown by a contemporary public, though numerous large institutions have long collected his work.|$|R

500|$|According to Maple, Pickingill left [...] "a {{legacy of}} myth which is curiously {{alien to the}} general run of witch traditions. In all the stories told of Pickingill there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> {{undercurrent}} of horror which one finds hard to pinpoint. Possibly it arises {{from the fact that}} many of those who recount the tales actually knew the man and experienced just such a quiet terror when he passed them in the village street." ...|$|E
50|$|The parish {{was also}} one of the many parishes {{depopulated}} by the 1957 eruption of the Capelinhos volcano, off the coast of Capelo.

50|$|Between 1907 and 1924 he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{teacher at}} the primary school in Uithuizermeeden. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> man, deeply religious. He {{explored}} many genres of writing, using a different pseudonym for every style. He wrote over 2,300 poems, but didn't publish all of them. His homosexuality made him controversial, especially in his religious environment.|$|R
500|$|The bore is {{cylindrical}} {{for most}} of the tube with an inner bore diameter between , but there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> hourglass shape, with the thinnest part below the junction between the upper and lower joint. The reduction is [...] depending on the maker. This [...] "hourglass" [...] shape, although invisible to the naked eye, helps to correct the pitch/scale discrepancy between the chalumeau and clarion registers (perfect 12th). The diameter of the bore affects characteristics such as available harmonics, timbre, and pitch stability (how far the player can bend a note in the manner required in jazz and other music). The bell {{at the bottom of the}} clarinet flares out to improve the tone and tuning of the lowest notes.|$|E
500|$|The APRF had {{a history}} of {{opposing}} mental health legislation; earlier in 1955, it had {{played a key role in}} stalling the passage of three mental health bills in the California Assembly. It was part of a wider network of far-right organizations which opposed psychiatry and psychology as being pro-communist, anti-American, anti-Christian and pro-Jewish. The Keep America Committee, another Californian [...] "superpatriot" [...] group, summed up the anti-mental health mood on the far right in a pamphlet issued in May 1955. Calling [...] "mental hygiene" [...] part of the [...] "unholy three" [...] of the [...] "Communistic World Government", it declared: [...] "Mental Hygiene <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> and diabolical plan of the enemy to transform a free and intelligent people into a cringing horde of zombies".|$|E

Thus after conquering the city they loot homes looking for books and destroying them; they also kill people suspected of preserving books, and empty the famed library. [...] Scholars have described their motivations as [...] "religious fanaticism", and have suggested that the depiction of the [...] "single-mindedness" [...] of the Alds <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> critique of [...] monotheism and imperialism.|$|E

500|$|... "It's the Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] was {{regarded}} by reviewers {{as the best}} segment in the episode. Canning wrote, [...] "this segment may not be all that gory, but it's funny and, quite honestly, it will just make you feel good", and Bentley described it as [...] "a dead-on comedy assault of the Charlie Brown animated Halloween special." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette concurred, writing that it [...] "succeeds because it offers sly cultural commentary." [...] Show Patrol wrote [...] "The nostalgia factor makes “Grand Pumpkin” {{the best of these}} amusing bits for me, but they all lack that trademark “Simpsons” brand of satirical smartness." [...] Hal Boedecker of the Orlando Sentinel gave the episode a 4/5 and called the final segment a [...] "witty parody of Charlie Brown's Halloween classic.

500|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are fairly}} short and pointed, with a falcate (sickle-like) shape. The first dorsal fin is medium-sized and triangular, and originates roughly over the pectoral fin free rear tips. The second dorsal fin {{is small and}} low, and originates over {{the middle of the}} anal fin base. Both dorsal fins have very long free rear tips, and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> midline ridge between them. A prominent notch is present on the caudal peduncle at the dorsal origin of the caudal fin. The caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The skin is covered by overlapping, oval-shaped dermal denticles; each denticle has three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is bronze above and white below, with a barely noticeable pale band on the flanks. The pectoral, pelvic, and anal fins sometimes have lighter margins, while the first dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe may have darker margins. The hardnose shark reaches [...] in length.|$|E

The anterior rim of each nostril bears a large triangular flap, which divides the nostril into incurrent and excurrent openings. The eyes are horizontally oval and equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Beneath each eye <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> ridge, and behind is a small spiracle. The mouth forms a short, wide arch, and bears moderately long furrows around the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain around 69 and 79 tooth rows respectively. Each tooth is small, with a narrow central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair over the pectoral fin bases.|$|E

The Berry family decided that Mary would have liked Vienna.|$|R
5000|$|Frontiers <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>subtle</b> shift. Mouse and Kelley {{were not}} {{involved}} with that cover. My vision for Frontiers was based on [...] "tunnels" [...] and the relativity of time and motion. Light stays the same, but time bends. It was Einstein theories for artist interpretation.
