5|$|The type {{specimen}} of Coelurus agilis, YPM 2010 (now considered a synonym of Coelurus fragilis) was recovered in the Brushy Basin {{member of the}} Morrison Formation, in Albany County, Wyoming. The specimen was collected by Reed in <b>gray</b> <b>sandstone</b> and brown/green claystone that were deposited during the Kimmeridgian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 157 to 152 million years ago. This specimen is housed {{in the collection of}} the Yale Peabody Museum in New Haven, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|The bed of Fishing Creek {{contains}} red {{and brown}} shale in some places. Other {{parts of the}} watershed lie over <b>gray</b> <b>sandstone</b> or conglomerates. There are numerous deposits of iron ore, limestone and marble in the watershed of Fishing Creek. Most of the rock in the watershed, including the Trimmers Rock Formation and Catskill Formation, is from the Devonian Period, {{but some of the}} northernmost tributaries have watersheds on rock from the Mississippian Period, such as the Huntley Mountain Formation and Burgoon sandstone. The creek is a freestone stream although its water is colder than that of most eastern freestone streams.|$|E
5|$|The {{channel of}} Stafford Meadow Brook is sinuous. It flows through rock {{formations}} consisting of sandstone and shale, with some coal occurring in its lower reaches. The Umbral or Red-shale formation {{is present in}} the stream's valley and contains iron ore. The iron ore deposits along the stream are embedded in fireclay and soft clay-shale. Below the ore is a layer of buff and greenish sandy shale. Below this in turn is a compact <b>gray</b> <b>sandstone.</b> A coal outcropping belonging to the Roaring Brook Basin is also in the stream's vicinity.|$|E
40|$|Formation. These {{rocks are}} {{dominated}} by interbedded and alternating red and <b>gray</b> <b>sandstones,</b> siltstones, shales, and mudstones. The rocks are arranged in fining-upward cycles from <b>gray</b> <b>sandstones</b> through red mudstones. Rocks are slightly folded; folds are broad and dips rarely exceed 15 degrees. Most fracturing is steeply dipping (70 degrees or more) and parallel or perpendicular to bedding. In the Catskill Formation of north-central Pennsylvania, localized enrichments of copper and uranium in paleochannel lag deposits may exist. Such lag deposits also may contain elevated concentrations of trace elements of arsenic, lead, and silver, and may contain pyrite nodules (Smith and Hoff, 1984) ...|$|R
25|$|Alternating {{layers of}} shallow marine and non-marine sediments were {{deposited}} as the shoreline fluctuated {{back and forth}} over the area. These sediments became the locally 650 to 750foot (200 to 230m) thick Masuk Member. The Masuk consists of cliff-forming cross-bedded sandstones and slope-forming yellowish-gray to bluish-gray mudstones with interbedded light <b>gray</b> <b>sandstones.</b> Fossils of bivalves, ceratopsian dinosaurs, crocodiles, gastropods, and turtles have been collected in this member.|$|R
50|$|Many {{features}} make Red Rock Coulee {{a special}} site to visit. Bedrock {{is close to}} the surface in this area, covered by only a thin layer of soil. Water erosion has carved the landscape over time and a badlands topography has formed in places. The bands of colour visible in the exposed bedrock are made of dark gray shales, greenish and <b>gray</b> <b>sandstones,</b> bentonitic clays and thin bands of ironstone.|$|R
5|$|The park's waterfalls expose two {{distinct}} rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. The higher and more recent {{of these is}} the Huntley Mountain Formation, from the late Devonian and early Mississippian. This is made of layers of olive green to <b>gray</b> <b>sandstone</b> and gray to red shale. The lower and older layer is the Catskill Formation, which is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370million years old. The harder Huntley Mountain Formation caps the Allegheny Front and has kept it from eroding as much as the softer Catskill Formation to the south. The portions of the Allegheny Front within the park are named North Mountain and Red Rock Mountain, with the latter name coming from an exposed band of Huntley Formation red shale and sandstone visible along Pennsylvania Route 487.|$|E
5|$|The {{third of}} the rock {{formations}} within the park is the Huntley Mountain Formation, from the late Devonian and early Mississippian. This is made of layers of olive green to <b>gray</b> <b>sandstone</b> and gray to red shale. The Huntley Mountain Formation is relatively hard and erosion resistant. It caps the Allegheny Front and has kept it from eroding {{as much as the}} softer Catskill Formation, to the south. The Catskill Formation is the lowest and oldest layer in the park, and is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370million years old. The Allegheny Front within the park is named North Mountain and Red Rock Mountain, with the latter name coming from an exposed band of Huntley Formation red shale and sandstone visible along Pennsylvania Route 487 (PA 487).|$|E
5|$|Geologists and the {{official}} Ricketts Glen State Park web page classify the falls at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend {{in a series of}} small steps. Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is <b>gray</b> <b>sandstone.</b> The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool. Brown's book Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers uses four types to classify waterfalls: falls, cascade, slide, and chute.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} in Garden Park {{can be divided}} informally into a lower and upper unit. The lower unit is composed primarily green and gray mudstones, with numerous lenticular, white to tan to <b>gray</b> <b>sandstones.</b> The upper is composed mostly of red mudstone, with lesser amounts of yellowish, often tabular sandstone. These two units probably correspond to the Tidwell, Saltwash and Brushy Basin members of the Morrison Formation on the Colorado Plateau.|$|R

25|$|The summit area of Mount Diablo {{is made up}} of {{deposits}} of <b>gray</b> <b>sandstone</b> (graywacke), chert, oceanic volcanic basalts (greenstone) and a minor amount of shale. The hard red Franciscan chert is sedimentary in origin and rich in microscopic radiolaria fossils and seashells. In the western foothills of the mountain there are large {{deposits of}} younger sandstone rocks also rich in seashells, severely tilted and in places forming dramatic ridgelines. Mount Diablo is a double pyramid and some say it resembles a volcano (which it isn't).|$|E
25|$|Little Nescopeck Creek {{is mostly}} {{situated}} {{on top of}} the Mauch Chunk Formation, a Mississippian period rock that consists of shale, conglomerate, and coarse <b>gray</b> <b>sandstone.</b> Areas containing the Mauch Chunk Formation in the watershed include the bottom of the Little Nescopeck Creek valley and Nescopeck Mountain. The Pottsville Formation is another formation in the creek's watershed. It consists of coarse sandstone, gray quartz conglomerate, and shale with some coal. The Pottsville Formation is found in small amounts on Nescopeck Mountain. There is no coal in the watershed of Little Nescopeck Creek. The watershed has never been mined.|$|E

25|$|The parish {{church of}} the San Andrés {{municipality}} was begun in the first third of the 16th century and finished {{in the first half}} of the 17th. The main façade is made of <b>gray</b> <b>sandstone</b> with three levels which a very large image of the Apostle Andrew, crucified on an X. The first contains the main entrance into the building, which is a simple arch with spandrels decorated with flowers. Just outside the door, there is a holy water font which is probably from the 16th century. The doorway niches contain images of San Bernardino and San Antonio, which was not common during the colonial period. The interior has only one nave as it was constructed in the 16th century. On the left side, there is a chapel of the Virgin of Solitude, which was constructed in the middle of the 18th century. It contains as Churrigueresque altar, with highly decorated pilasters. The decoration on the cupolas were done in the second half of the 18th century and redone at the end of the 19th. This chapel also contains a large number of paintings which date back as far as the 17th century.|$|E

40|$|Low pH {{zones in}} {{portions}} of the overburden at the Dave Johnston Coal Field, Converse County, Wyoming {{are the subject of}} this study. The low pH zones are restricted to limonite stained sandstones which grade downdip into normal pH <b>gray</b> <b>sandstones.</b> Changes in color, clay mineralogy, cementation and feldspar surface textures are noted between the two sandstone units. These changes appear {{to be the result of}} post depositional alteration that was responsible for oxidation of pyrite and chlorite, dissoluion of calcite, and the etching of feldspar grains. The parameters for the diagenesis fit those of uranium roll front models proposed for the Powder River Basin. The alteration appears responsible for the low pH values reported in the yellow sandstone. Research by the North Dakota Geological Survey on similar problems associated with lignite mines in North Dakota suggests reclamation procedures for dealing with these potentially hazardous overburden spoils...|$|R
5000|$|The {{species is}} known {{from a very}} large number of {{attached}} and isolated plant sections ranging from new seedlings to a large upright partial stump, collected from two outcrops of the Paskapoo Formation exposed east of Red Deer in central Alberta. [...] The formation is composed of medium-grain buff to light <b>gray</b> <b>sandstones</b> interbedded with ﬁner sandstones and mudstones lying at an almost flat level. The outcrop at the Munce’s Hill location, also known as One Jaw Gap, is heavily fractured which resulted in difficulty removing the fossils for study. A number of the larger specimens were photographed prior to removal from the outcrop face to aid in study. Present at the Munce’s Hill location was one large upright stump which Stockey, Rothwell and Falder interpreted as being preserved in situ. The fossils of the formation are preserved as coalified compressions which have been oxidized.|$|R

City voters passed an {{initiative}} in 1893 to sell bonds to build a high school, but the Panic of 1893 delayed construction. A design by local architect William White was chosen over three other proposals. White's Romanesque Revival three-story structure featured a small central circular building, two rectangular wings, and an eight-story, four-faced clock tower. Construction on the building, located at 1400 First Avenue North, began in 1894. The high school was built of <b>gray</b> <b>sandstone</b> obtained from quarries near both Helena and Great Falls.

To compact the foundation's backfill, a herd of sheep was driven around the structure 100 times. Wood for the interior supports, roof, and steps were cut from massive trees logged in the Rocky Mountains and floated down the Missouri River. The finished building featured a tin mansard roof (molded and painted to look like tile), gables, and an attic suspended from the roof joists. The interior woodwork was solid oak, all rooms had [...] high wainscoting, the solid doors were [...] thick, and highly detailed molded pediments were emplaced over each door. Ornate brass doorknobs and hinges were used throughout the building, and heat was supplied by cast iron radiators with delicate, filigreed covers. The building (whose original cost was estimated at $59,940) was completed by McKay Brothers in 1896 at a total cost of $110,000. The structure, which was designed to educate 500 students, contained 14 classrooms, a physical laboratory, a chemical laboratory, an art studio, and an assembly hall that could seat 400.
