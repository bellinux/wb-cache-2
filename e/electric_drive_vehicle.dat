40|$|With a {{potential}} {{to facilitate the}} integration of renewable energy into the electricity system, <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>vehicles</b> may offer a considerable flexibility by allowing for charging and discharging when desired. This paper takes the perspective of an aggregator that manages the electricity market participation of a vehicle fleet and presents a framework for optimizing charging and discharging of the <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>vehicles,</b> given the driving patterns of the fleet and the variations in market prices of electricity. When the aggregator is a price-taker the optimization can be {{stated in terms of}} linear programming whereas a quadratic programming formulation is required when he/she has market power. A Danish case study illustrates the construction of representative driving patterns through clustering of survey data from Western Denmark and the prediction of electricity price variations through regression on prices from the Nordic market. The results show that electric vehicles provide flexibility almost exclusively through charging. Moreover, the vehicles provide flexibility within the day but only limited flexibility from day to day when driving patterns are fixed. <b>Electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>vehicles</b> <b>Driving</b> patterns Electricity prices Linear programming Quadratic programming...|$|R

5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion {{as most of}} the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>vehicles</b> do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>vehicles</b> typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{save the}} test {{energy of the}} <b>{{electric}}</b> <b>drive</b> <b>vehicle,</b> an electric vehicle drive dynamic testing system, with energy recovery is proposed. The electric vehicle DC/AC power drive can be regulated by a speed control mode and a torque control mode in a three-phase electric vehicle induction motor. The three-phase electric vehicle induction motor is directly coupled with a three-phase load induction motor through a coupler. The load of the DC/AC power drive is also regulated by the torque control mode and the speed control mode to drive the three-phase load induction motor. The three-phase load induction motor is operated in the regenerative braking mode, and the regenerative energy of the load induction motor can {{be transferred to the}} utility system by a power regenerative DC/AC inverter that feedbacks the energy to the utility system with a unit power factor.
