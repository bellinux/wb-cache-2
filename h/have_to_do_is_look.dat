5000|$|In {{his first}} game as a collegiate coach, William & Mary routed VMI, 54-6. The Indians' head coach, Rube McCray, said he would never lose to a former high school coach. To {{counteract}} William & Mary's large defensive line and linebacker corps, Nugent began developing the I formation, which he debuted the following year in 1950. VMI beat William & Mary, 28-23 and upset 28-point favorite Georgia Tech, 14-13. The Keydets posted over 400 offensive yards in both contests. The new formation's success prompted Notre Dame head coach Frank Leahy to send two assistant coaches to observe VMI's spring practice the following year. In {{the second quarter of}} the 1951 season opener against Indiana, Notre Dame used the I formation to score four touchdowns. Nugent began giving coaching clinics on the I formation, and in 1961, John McKay replaced his pro T with the I at Southern California. McKay's success with the formation the following season prompted more teams to adopt it around the country. The I formation's invention is occasionally misattributed to McKay or Leahy, to which Nugent responded, [...] "It's something that's long been misunderstood ...

5000|$|Jones {{appeared}} weakened {{after dropping}} {{a significant amount}} of weight in order to get back down to light heavyweight, but he nevertheless was able to pick up a disputed majority decision victory. Though Tarver landed more punches than Jones, Jones landed a higher percentage of his punches (Tarver landed 175 of his 506 thrown punches for a 35% success rate, while Jones landed 167 of his 406 thrown punches for a 41% success rate). When the fight ended, however, Tarver had done noticeable damage to Jones' face as his left eye was swelled almost completely shut and he was bleeding from the nose. The fight then went to the judge's scorecards. One judge had the bout even at 114-114, but the other two had Jones clearly ahead with scores of 117-111 and 116-112. The crowd, thinking Tarver had done enough to win the fight, loudly booed after Michael Buffer announced the decision and chanted [...] "bullshit" [...] as Jones remained in the ring for his post-fight interview with Larry Merchant. Tarver also felt that he had defeated Jones and told Merchant [...] "All you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> at his face to know I won." ...|$|E
