Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy surrounding this news, Madonna concentrated {{on the development of}} her eighth studio album, Music. Buoyed up by the commercial success of 1998's Ray of Light album, she was keen on <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio to record new material. She was then introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Madonna instantly liked his pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and his utilization of acid bass in his songs.|$|E

25|$|Along {{the way in}} Millard Canyon, {{a special}} station stop was made at Dawn Station above the Dawn Mines, an old gold mining operation. The mines were deep in the canyon and {{visitors}} stopping off to see the digs spent an exorbitant amount of time <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> train. A false adit was dug just a hundred feet below the track to trick people into thinking they had visited the mine and were shortly ready {{to return to the}} train.|$|E
25|$|Skiers use {{outriggers}} {{for balance}} and as leverage when they fall to right themselves. Outriggers {{are also used}} for turning; skiers use the outrigger and their upper body by leaning into the direction they want to turn. In para-Nordic skiing, outriggers or ski poles are used to propel the skier forward. If skiers fall, they may require assistance in righting themselves, and/or <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fall line. Doing this on their own, they need to position their mono-ski facing uphill relative to the fall line.|$|E
25|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of her album Ray of Light (1998), Madonna intended {{to embark on}} a new concert tour in 1999, but due to the delay of her film The Next Best Thing, it was cancelled. By 2000, Madonna was dating director Guy Ritchie, and was pregnant with their child. Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy surrounding this news, Madonna concentrated on the development of her eighth studio album, Music, instead of embarking on a tour. Buoyed up by the commercial success of her previous album, she was keen on <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio to record new music. Madonna was well disposed towards William Orbit, producer of Ray of Light, but by 2000, his production and sound had become ubiquitous. Also, the music scene was being dominated by a younger generation of singers like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, prompting Madonna to look for a more distinctive sound. It was then that she was introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï through some common friends. Madonna instantly liked the pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and acid bass in his songs.|$|E

The fragrance, entitled Homme by David Beckham, would join existing scents David Beckham Instinct (2005) and Intimately Beckham (2006), a his-and-hers collection with his wife Victoria Beckham. Steve Mormoris, senior vice president of global marketing for Coty Beauty, told Women's Wear Daily that the fragrance is a strategic launch for Coty that represents [...] "a key new orientation for the David Beckham fragrance brand— <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> male roots of the brand, enhancing David as an athlete and an aspirational man and building a new pillar to the David Beckham franchise."

While {{he had been}} {{disappointed}} with several episodes since the show's mid-season break, VanDerWerff noted: [...] "Glee still has its inconsistencies, but it's <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> show I so enjoyed last fall." [...] He wrote of the Sean storyline that it: [...] "should feel offensive but mostly skates away from actually being so because it treats the paralyzed character {{with a great deal}} of respect". Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle also noted that he had been underwhelmed with the show since its return, but loved [...] "Laryngitis", writing: [...] "The story focused exclusively on the kids—not Mr. Shue or Sue Sylvester—and the performances were realistically small-scale. [...] All that classic Glee charm came washing over me once more and it was glorious." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times similarly stated: [...] "When Glee is at its best, you get episodes like this week's. There were no gimmicks, no over-the-top productions, no unnecessary stars [...] It was just great storytelling and superb finger-snapping music." [...] Vanity Fair Brett Berk deemed [...] "Laryngitis" [...] a [...] "truly successful episode", but also highlighted the show's inconsistency in quality since its return. James Poniewozik of Time called [...] "Laryngitis" [...] the first episode of Glee since its mid-season break that he enjoyed [...] "(mostly) without reservation." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 8.8/10, deeming it one of his favorite episodes of Glee, [...] "with some of the funniest material the show has delivered thus far." ...|$|E

She was then introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Madonna instantly liked his pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and his utilization of acid bass in his songs. Ahmadzaï always preferred taking musical risks and hence he wanted the collaborations with Madonna to get out the best from the singer. Before the album was released, Madonna recorded a statement to her fans, stating about the album and Ahmadzaï: ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the major}} forms of {{literature}} during the Han dynasty was the fu (sometimes translated as [...] "rhapsody"), a kind of eclectic grab bag of prose and verse, not easy to classify in English as being either poetry or prose. In Chinese, the fu is classified as wen rather than shi, however these terms do not correspond to English categories of prose and verse (one {{of the differences in}} the traditional Chinese categorization being that shi was sung or chanted, whereas the fu was not, at least according to the Hanshu), the credibility of this being enhanced by the fact that one of the compilers of the Hanshu (also known as Book of Han or History of the Former Han Dynasty) was Ban Gu, who was himself a practitioner of the fu style. The Han fu derived from the Chuci, which was traditionally considered to be the work of Qu Yuan, who was a wanderer through the countryside and villages of the Kingdom of Chu, after his exile from court. In this context the [...] "Li Sao" [...] is particularly relevant. The Han fu of the second and first centuries BCE were intimately associated with the courts of the emperor and his princes. In other words, they were refined literary products, ornate, polished, and with an elite vocabulary; and, often the subject matter includes topics such as life in the palaces of the Han capital cities. The development of the fu form of literature during the Han dynasty shows a movement toward later more personal poetry and the poems of reclusion, typical for example, of Tao Yuanming, the Six Dynasties poet. The famous Han dynasty astronomer, mathematician, inventor, geographer, cartographer, artist, poet, statesman, and literary scholar Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) wrote a fu about his own, personal experience (real or imagined) of getting out of the city and its politics and <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country and nature. The fu form continued to be popular in the centuries following the demise of the Han imperial power.|$|E
