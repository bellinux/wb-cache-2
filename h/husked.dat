A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E

25|$|A {{localized}} but damaging tornado outbreak produced 11 tornadoes {{in eastern}} North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota {{on the evening}} of August 26, 2007. A large EF3 tornado passed near Rugh Lake, North Dakota, destroying garages and outbuildings on three farms, tossing grain bins, and snapping numerous trees. Gravel roads were deeply scarred by flying debris, five bison were killed, and two heavy combines were thrown and smashed to pieces by the tornado. The strongest tornado of the outbreak was a large, rain-wrapped EF4 wedge that devastated the town of Northwood, North Dakota. This multiple-vortex tornado began to the southwest of town, snapping numerous trees and striking the Northwood Muni-Vince Airport at EF1 strength, where several planes were damaged. A metal storage building and a small airplane hangar were reduced to bare slabs at that location. The tornado grew to nearly a mile wide and reached EF3 strength as it struck Northwood directly. Of the roughly 460 homes in Northwood, 90% of them sustained some type of damage. The local health center, bank, fire station, school, supermarket, and grain elevator were all damaged. Near the grain elevator, several rail cars were knocked off the tracks. Hundreds of trees were snapped, uprooted, or damaged throughout town, and one person was killed in a mobile home park that was destroyed at the north edge of town. A small area of EF4 damage was noted as the tornado exited at the northeast corner of town. An agricultural company, a construction company, and a car dealership were completely destroyed in this area. The construction company was entirely flattened, with steel beams twisted and thrown into nearby fields. A large metal storage tank that originated in this area was found 1.5 miles away in a corn field. Numerous vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards from the car dealership, many of which were mangled beyond recognition. Farm fields in this area were heavily scoured, and mature corn stalks in one field were snapped at the base and flattened to the ground, with <b>husked</b> ears of corn found scattered about. EF1 damage was observed further to the northeast before the tornado dissipated. In addition to the fatality, 18 other people were injured in Northwood. Later that evening, an EF2 tornado touched down near Reynolds, North Dakota, snapping numerous trees near the Red River, and flattening a flag pole and an antique windmill to the ground. The tornado crossed into Minnesota, where a quonset hut and a pole shed were destroyed before the tornado dissipated near Eldred. Eight other weak tornadoes occurred that evening as well.|$|E

However, approximately half an official's salary in grain was made in payments of cash coins, the standard of which, after 119 BC, was the wushu (五銖) coin measuring 3.2 g (0.11oz). The other half of an official's salary consisted of unhusked grain and <b>husked</b> grain measured in hu (觳, approximately 20 L / 676 oz); since one hu of unhusked grain was equal to 100 coins and one hu of <b>husked</b> grain was equal to 160 coins, the conversion ratio for unhusked grain to <b>husked</b> grain was 10 to 6 (see table below).

This olive <b>husk</b> is usually carried from presses to an Olive Waste Management Center where a mechanical milling extraction process is performed to obtain Olive Pomace Oil. The remaining oil in the <b>husk</b> is chemically extracted and finally, the residual <b>husk</b> is used as fuel for a cogeneration process to produce electricity. The olive Pomace Oil from mechanical milling has higher quality and price than the one extracted chemically. As the seasonal olive collection campaign is from October to March, <b>husk</b> usually is stored and processed along the year. Due to the own <b>husk</b> chemical degradation and the constrained milling capacity, not all received <b>husk</b> is milled mechanically but always chemically. Different pools are used to store and classify <b>husk</b> qualities. There are pools for short, medium and long term horizons. Short term pools have low storage capacity and contains high quality <b>husk</b> which is shortly milled mechanically. Medium term pools have higher storage capacity containing medium quality <b>husk.</b> These mid term pools provide <b>husk</b> to be milled mechanically when the collection rate decreases, or the <b>husk</b> quality coming from presses is poor. Long term pools have also high storage capacity and store <b>husk</b> with poor quality to be processed only chemically.
