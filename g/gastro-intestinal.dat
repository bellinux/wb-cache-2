5|$|In late 1995, Jackson {{was rushed}} to a {{hospital}} after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance (which was subsequently cancelled); a non-related writer claims that the incident {{was caused by a}} stress-related panic attack, while medics cited irregular beats, <b>gastro-intestinal</b> inflammation, dehydration, and kidney and liver irregularities. In none of these hospitalizations, including this one, did medics find drugs in Jackson's system. The BBC reported that during his 2005 trial, the singer again suffered from stress-related illnesses and severe weight loss.|$|E
5|$|Upon his retirement, Butler {{bought a}} home in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, where {{he lived with his}} wife. In June 1940, he checked himself into the {{hospital}} after becoming sick a few weeks earlier. His doctor described his illness as an incurable condition of the upper <b>gastro-intestinal</b> tract that was probably cancer. His family remained by his side, even bringing his new car so he could see it from the window. He {{never had a chance to}} drive it. On June 21, 1940, Smedley Butler died in the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and <b>gastro-intestinal</b> worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style {{is such that}} few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii {{has been found in}} polar bears, and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E
25|$|Cantharidin is dangerously toxic, {{inhibiting}} {{the enzyme}} phosphatase 2A. It causes irritation, blistering, bleeding and discomfort. These effects can escalate to erosion and bleeding of mucosa in each system, sometimes followed by severe <b>gastro-intestinal</b> bleeding and acute tubular necrosis and glomerular destruction, resulting in <b>gastro-intestinal</b> and renal dysfunction, by organ failure, and death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastro-intestinal</b> (GI) {{effects and}} {{asthenia}} {{are the most}} common adverse events.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastro-intestinal</b> {{reactions}} can {{be due to}} malabsorption {{or other}} GI Tract abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Swallowing {{difficulties}} such as with prematurity {{and coordination}} of sucking, swallowing and breathing, or <b>gastro-intestinal</b> tract abnormalities like tracheo-oesophageal fistula.|$|E
25|$|Food {{intolerance}} reactions {{can include}} pharmacologic, metabolic, and <b>gastro-intestinal</b> responses to foods or food compounds. Food intolerance {{does not include}} either psychological responses or foodborne illness.|$|E
25|$|In adults {{side effects}} with greater than 10% {{incidence}} include weight gain, headache, agitation or anxiety, insomnia, and <b>gastro-intestinal</b> effects like nausea and constipation, and lightheadedness. Side effects in children are similar, and include sleepiness, increased appetite, and stuffy nose. A {{strong desire to}} gamble, binge eat, shop, and have sex may also occur. Cases of pathological gambling have been reported.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reactions}} {{have been}} noted in manufacturer guidelines — deep sleep, incoordination, sedation, calmness, and dizziness {{have been reported in}} children and adults, as well as others such as hypotension, tinnitus, and headaches. <b>Gastro-intestinal</b> effects have also been observed, as well as less serious effects such as dryness of the mouth and constipation caused by the mild antimuscarinic properties of hydroxyzine.|$|E
25|$|Cyclooxygenases {{have two}} main isoforms that are called COX-1 and COX-2 (as {{well as a}} COX-3). COX-1 is {{responsible}} for the synthesis of prostaglandin and thromboxane in many types of cells, including the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> tract and blood platelets. COX-2 {{plays a major role in}} prostaglandin biosynthesis in inflammatory cells and in the central nervous system. Prostaglandin synthesis in these sites is a key factor in the development of inflammation and hyperalgesia.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} {{should be}} tailored to the cause involved and {{the severity of the}} disease process. With oral osteoporosis the emphasis should be on good nutrient absorption and metabolic wastes elimination through a healthy <b>gastro-intestinal</b> function, effective hepatic metabolism of toxicants such as exogenous estrogens, endogenous acetaldehyde and heavy metals, a balanced diet, healthy lifestyle, assessment of factors related to potential coagulopathies, and treatment of periodontal diseases and other oral and dental infections.|$|E
25|$|Pica is an {{appetite}} for, or {{the behavior of}} eating, non-nutritive substances (e.g., sand, coal, soil, chalk, paper etc.). Pica can be dangerous to dogs, with a risk from eating dirt near roads that existed prior to the phaseout of tetraethyllead in gasoline or prior to the cessation {{of the use of}} contaminated oil (either used, or containing toxic PCBs) to settle dust. In addition to poisoning, there is a risk of <b>gastro-intestinal</b> obstruction or tearing in the stomach or blockage of the esophagus.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} from the United States, Nwokolo was {{appointed}} associate professor of medicine. Subsequently, {{he set up a}} sub department of gastroenterology, with senior registrar Dr. Lewis. Nwokolo led research on various <b>gastro-intestinal</b> problems using intestinal biopsies and procedures he learnt in the United States at University of Minnesota. Numerous liver and pancreatic function studies were carried out. Intense, dedicated and diligent teaching of medical students was done. Nwokolo stated that one of his most brilliant students was Jibril Aminu. His long-standing friend: professor Ogunlesi remembered this period of Nwokolo's servant leadership as valuable and inspiring.|$|E
25|$|Perforation (a hole in {{the wall}} of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract) often leads to catastrophic consequences if left untreated. Erosion of the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> wall by the ulcer leads to spillage of the stomach or intestinal content into the abdominal cavity. Perforation at the anterior surface of the stomach leads to acute peritonitis, initially chemical and later bacterial peritonitis. The first sign is often sudden intense abdominal pain; an example is Valentino's syndrome, named after the silent-film actor who experienced this pain before his death. Posterior wall perforation leads to bleeding due to the involvement of gastroduodenal artery that lies posterior to {{the first part of the}} duodenum.|$|E
25|$|Pica is most {{commonly}} seen in pregnant women, small children, {{and those with}} developmental disabilities such as autism. Children eating painted plaster containing lead may suffer brain damage from lead poisoning. There is a similar risk from eating soil near roads that existed before tetraethyllead in petrol was phased out (in some countries) or before people stopped using contaminated oil (containing toxic PCBs or dioxin) to settle dust. In addition to poisoning, {{there is also a}} much greater risk of <b>gastro-intestinal</b> obstruction or tearing in the stomach. Another risk of eating soil is the ingestion of animal feces and accompanying parasites. Pica can also be found in other animals and is commonly found in dogs.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{research}} into little penguins has been ongoing {{in the area}} for 48 years, monitoring the colony both on land and at sea to better understand threats to population and breeding. Threats at sea include disease, impacts to food supply as well as climate change. In 1995 a previously unknown Herpes virus infected millions of pilchards (Sardinops sagax) across Australia, at the same time increases in little penguin moralities were reported across western Victoria and numbers crossing the Summerland Beach declined. Scientists found that these penguins had died from starvation and <b>gastro-intestinal</b> parasitism due to the mass mortality of one of their main food species, which also impacted penguin breeding success the following season. Further {{research into}} little penguin diets continues to better understand the impact of prey mortalities on their biology and foraging ecology.|$|E
25|$|In {{their native}} arid and {{semi-arid}} climates, donkeys {{spend more than}} half of each day foraging and feeding, often on poor quality scrub. The donkey has a tough digestive system in which roughage is efficiently broken down by hind gut fermentation, microbial action in the caecum and large intestine. While there is no marked structural difference between the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> tract of a donkey and that of a horse, the digestion of the donkey is more efficient. It needs less food than a horse or pony of comparable height and weight, approximately 1.5 percent of body weight per day in dry matter, compared to the 2–2.5 percent consumption rate possible for a horse. Donkeys are also less prone to colic. The reasons for this difference are not fully understood; the donkey may have different intestinal flora to the horse, or a longer gut retention time.|$|E
25|$|The Nagorno-Karabakh {{conflict}} {{has resulted in}} the displacement of 597,000 Azerbaijanis (this figure includes 230,000 children born to IDPs and 54,000 who have returned) including Artsakh, and 220,000 Azeris, 18,000 Kurds and 3,500 Russians fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan from 1988 to 1989. The Azerbaijani government has estimated that 63 percent of internally displaced persons (IDPs) lived below the poverty line as compared to 49% of the total population. About 154,000 lived in the capital, Baku. According to the International Organization for Migration, 40,000 IDPs lived in camps, 60,000 in underground dugout shelters, and 20,000 in railway cars. Forty-thousand IDPs lived in EU-funded settlements and UNHCR provided housing for another 40,000. Another 5,000 IDPs lived in abandoned or rapidly deteriorating schools. Others lived in trains, on roadsides in half-constructed buildings, or in public buildings such as tourist and health facilities. Tens of thousands lived in seven tent camps where poor water supply and sanitation caused <b>gastro-intestinal</b> infections, tuberculosis, and malaria.|$|E
25|$|Despite being rich in resources, Chiapas, {{along with}} Oaxaca and Guerrero, lags behind {{the rest of}} the country in almost all {{socioeconomic}} indicators. , there were 889,420 residential units, with 71% having running water, 77.3% having sewerage, and 93.6% having electricity. Construction of these units is varied from modern construction of block and concrete to those constructed of wood and laminate. Because of it high economic marginalization, more people migrate from Chiapas than migrate to it. Most of its socioeconomic indicators are the lowest in the country including income, education, health and housing. It has a significantly higher percentage of illiteracy than {{the rest of the}} country although that situation has improved since the 1970s when over 45% were illiterate and in the 1980s when about 32% were. The tropical climate presents health challenges, with most illnesses related to the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> tract and parasites. As of 2005, the state has 1,138 medical facilities: 1098 outpatient and 40 inpatient. Most are run by IMSS and ISSSTE and other government agencies. The implementation of NAFTA has had negative effects on the economy, often by lowering prices for agricultural products. It has also worked to make the southern states of Mexico poorer in comparison to those in the north with over 90% of the poorest municipalities in the south of the country. As of 2006, 31.8% work in communal services, social services and personal services. 18.4% work in financial services, insurance and real estate, 10.7% work in commerce, restaurants and hotels, 9.8% work in construction, 8.9% in utilities, 7.8% in transportation, 3.4% in industry (excluding handcrafts), and 8.4% in agriculture.|$|E
500|$|Bismuth subsalicylate {{is used as}} an antidiarrheal; it is {{the active}} {{ingredient}} in such [...] "Pink Bismuth" [...] preparations as Pepto-Bismol, {{as well as the}} 2004 reformulation of Kaopectate. It is also used to treat some other <b>gastro-intestinal</b> diseases and cadmium poisoning. The mechanism of action of this substance is still not well documented, although an oligodynamic effect (toxic effect of small doses of heavy metal ions on microbes) may be involved in at least some cases. Salicylic acid from hydrolysis of the compound is antimicrobial for toxogenic E. coli, an important pathogen in traveler's diarrhea.|$|E
2500|$|Sonomicrometry was {{originally}} {{applied in the}} study of cardiac function in research animals by Dean Franklin in 1956, and was quickly adopted by biologists working in biomechanics as well as other physiological organ systems and structures (<b>gastro-intestinal,</b> uro-genital and musculo-skeletal). [...] Medical device companies also use sonomicrometry to assess the physical performance, durability and longevity of devices during R phase of development. [...] Sonomicrometry is currently the most prevalent method for determining muscle length changes during animal locomotion, feeding, and other biomechanical functions.|$|E
5000|$|Coprococcus {{may be used}} as a {{microbial}} biomarker {{to assess}} the health of the human <b>gastro-intestinal</b> tract. Gut microorganisms maintain <b>gastro-intestinal</b> health and the mounting evidence of <b>gastro-intestinal</b> problems in autistic children makes a link between autism and intestinal microbiota highly probable, but the paucity of data on intestinal microflora means a definite link has not yet been demonstrated. Early studies overlooked potentially beneficial gut flora missing in autistic children.|$|E
