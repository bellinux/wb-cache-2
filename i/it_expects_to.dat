The plan called for KKR to complete a reverse takeover of its listed affiliate KKR Private Equity Investors {{in exchange for a}} 21% interest in the firm. In November 2008, KKR announced a delay of this transaction until 2009. Shares of KPE had declined significantly {{in the second half of}} 2008 with the onset of the credit crunch. KKR has announced that <b>it</b> <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> close the transaction in 2009. In October 2009, KKR listed shares in KKR & Co. on the Euronext exchange, replacing KPE and anticipates a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. The public entity represents a 30% interest in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In October 2010, KKR acquired about nine members of Goldman Sachs Group proprietary trading team after entertaining offers from investment firms such as Perella Weinberg and Blackrock. With Goldman shutting down its proprietary trading operations, its executives, led by Bob Howard, will help KKR expand beyond leveraged buyouts into areas such as hedge funds.|$|E

2500|$|The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation is {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} founded in 1937 by philanthropist Solomon R. Guggenheim and his long-time art advisor, artist Hilla von Rebay. [...] The foundation is a leading institution for the collection, preservation, and research of modern and contemporary art and operates several museums around the world. [...] The first museum established by the foundation was The Museum of Non-Objective Painting, in New York City. [...] This became The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1952, and the foundation moved the collection into its first permanent museum building, in New York City, in 1959. The foundation next opened the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, Italy, in 1980.

2500|$|The cost of {{producing}} a 787 exceeded the purchase price {{at the end of}} 2013. Boeing's accounting method books sales immediately and distributes estimated production costs over ten years for the 1,300 aircraft <b>it</b> <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> deliver during that time. JPMorgan Chase analyst Joseph Nadol estimated the program's cash loss to be $45 million per airplane, decreasing as the program moves forward. [...] The actual cash flow reflects Boeing collecting most of the purchase price upon delivery; Boeing expects deferred costs to total $25 billion before the company begins to break even on production; the comparable number for the Boeing 777, adjusted for inflation, is $3.7 billion. [...] Boeing plans to improve financial return by reorganizing the production line, renegotiating contracts with suppliers and labor unions, and increasing the 787 production rate, stepwise, to 12 airplanes per month by the end of 2016 and 14 airplanes per month {{by the end of the}} decade.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 September 2014, Wonga {{announced}} that its {{profits for the}} year {{to the end of}} December 2013 had fallen by 53% to £39.7 million. The company blamed [...] "remediation costs" [...] – compensation paid to customers – which in total cost the company £18.8m. Wonga also said <b>it</b> <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "smaller and less profitable" [...] in future, in part due to new controls set by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Since July 2014, all payday loan companies have had to conform to new rules, which limit roll-overs of loans and force them to increase affordability checks. From January 2015, they were also to have their charges capped. On 2 October 2014, Wonga agreed to write off the debts – thought to total £220m – of 330,000 customers who were in arrears of 30 days or more. This was a direct consequence of discussions with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).|$|E

[...] According to Toyota {{these are the}} states where nearly 60% of all Prius models are currently sold in the country. The Prius Plug-in was originally advertised to become available in all remaining states in 2013; however, nationwide availability never materialized and the car was only sold in the original 15 states until its discontinuation in 2015. Toyota announced <b>it</b> <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> sell in the U.S. market around 15,000 units a year initially.

60|$|In the East it is {{the male}} who is dignified and even ceremonial. Possibly {{that is why he}} wears skirts. I pointed out long ago that petticoats, which some regard as a garb of humiliation for women are really {{regarded}} as the only garb of magnificence for men, when they wish to be something more than men. They are worn by kings, by priests, and by judges. The male Moslem, especially in his own family, is the king and the priest and the judge. I do not mean merely that he is the master, as many would say of the male in many Western societies, especially simple and self-governing societies. I mean something more; I mean that he has not only the kingdom and the power but the glory, and even as it were the glamour. I mean he has not only the rough leadership that we often give to the man, but the special sort of social beauty and stateliness that we generally expect only of the woman. What we mean when we say that an ambitious man wants to have a fine woman {{at the head of the}} dinner-table, that the Moslem world really means when <b>it</b> <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> see a fine man at the head of the house. Even in the street he is the peacock, coloured much more splendidly than the peahen. Even when clad in comparatively sober and partly European costume, as outside the cafes of Cairo and the great cities, he exhibits this indefinable character not merely of dignity but of pomp. It can be traced even in the tarbouch, the minimum of Turkish attire worn by all the commercial classes; the thing more commonly called in England a fez. The fez is not a sort of smoking cap. It is a tower of scarlet often tall enough to be the head-dress of a priest. And it is a hat one cannot take off to a lady.|$|E
