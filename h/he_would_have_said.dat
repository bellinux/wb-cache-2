25|$|The {{case against}} Chapman rests {{mainly on the}} point that he {{undoubtedly}} was a violent man with a misogynistic streak. He was known to beat his common-law-wives and was prone to other violent behaviour. While living in the US, Chapman allegedly forced his wife, Lucy Klosowska, down on their bed and began to strangle her, only stopping to attend to a customer who walked into the shop which adjoined their room. When he left, she was said to have found a knife under the pillow. He reportedly later told her that he had planned to behead her, even pointing out the spot where he would have buried her and reciting what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> to their neighbours.|$|E
500|$|Sykes {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy was now [...] "more of a tribute thing" [...] {{and that it}} would be wrong to record new {{material}} under that name. He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money. [...] "We'd stop if we thought we were just going through the motions... I think that has a lot to do with the songs â€“ if they were inferior, then maybe we would have got tired of it all. But they're not and we haven't," [...] he said. In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: [...] "He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level. There's no way <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> 'No-one should play those songs again.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Manson {{appeared}} in Michael Moore's documentary, Bowling for Columbine; his appearance was filmed during the band's first show in Denver since the shooting. When Moore asked Manson what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{to the students}} at Columbine, he replied, [...] "I wouldn't say a single word to them. I would {{listen to what they}} have to say and that's what no one did." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'What {{a soldier}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made!' <b>said</b> Gerard thoughtfully. 'What a {{quartermaster}} for the Hussars of Bercheny! He {{must have been}} a very foolish person to set his will against that of the Emperor.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Goble {{regarded}} the silver-tongued orator wrathfully. He was {{not accustomed to}} chatterboxes arguing with him like this. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>have</b> <b>said</b> something momentous and crushing, {{but at this point}} Jill intervened.|$|R
2500|$|After the Appeals court ruling, Dell'Utri {{expressed}} {{his admiration for}} the late Vittorio Mangano, a convicted Mafioso who up to his death in prison denied that any link existed between Cosa Nostra and Dell'Utri and Berlusconi. [...] "He was a sick inmate who was asked to testify against me and Berlusconi and always refused to do so. If he had, anything <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> would have been believed. But he preferred to stay in prison, and die there, rather than to make unjust accusations," [...] Dell'Utri said. [...] "He was my hero. I don't know if I could have resisted {{as much as he}} did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Berlin's daughter, Mary Ellin Barrett, {{states that}} the song was {{actually}} [...] "very personal" [...] for her father, and was intended {{as an expression of}} his deep gratitude to the nation for merely [...] "allowing" [...] him, an immigrant raised in poverty, to become a successful songwriter. [...] "To me," [...] said Berlin, [...] "'God Bless America' was not just a song but an expression of my feeling toward the country to which I owe what I have and what I am." [...] The Economist magazine writes that [...] "Berlin was producing a deep-felt paean to the country that had given him what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> was everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{expression}} {{has been}} referenced numerous times in {{various types of}} media, including the films Bamboozled, Undercover Brother, Let's Do It Again, House Party and several television series: The Mindy Project, Prison Break, The Boondocks, The Wire, Weeds, Where My Dogs At?, Reno 911!, 30 Rock, Everybody Hates Chris, A Different World, The PJs, Bridezillas, Mad TV and Cedric the Entertainer Presents, Empire, and reality series The Real Housewives of Atlanta. In the Maude episode [...] "" [...] (season 1, episode 18), which aired on February 13, 1973, Henry Evans (who later becomes James Evans Sr. on Good Times) says to Florida, [...] "I'm coming back at 9:00, and I mean 9:00 WPT." [...] He leaves and Maude asks Florida, what's [...] "WPT"? [...] Florida responds [...] "White People Time. If he didn't mean 9:00 sharp <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> CPT. That's Colored People Time. Which means 'shuffle on in when you feel like it'". In The Wire S03E08 Moral Midgetry, when a girl asked Marlo Stanfield {{when he wants to}} meet, Marlo responded, [...] "Five. [...] And five mean five. [...] I don't truck CP Time. [...] Five and change; I'm gone." [...] The mention of [...] "CPT" [...] in the television series Prison Break was by the white supremacist character Theodore [...] "T-Bag" [...] Bagwell. In the Black Jeopardy sketch aired during the March 29, 2014 episode of Saturday Night Live, host Darnell Hayes (Kenan Thompson) says upon the sound of the final bell, [...] "As usual, we started late." ...|$|E
60|$|Tommy was off, as <b>he</b> himself <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> like a shot, and on {{gaining the}} beach almost {{ran into the}} arms of a young coast-guard-man named Supple Rodger, to whom he breathlessly told his tale.|$|R
6000|$|Hugh, {{from his}} face, might have feared a still greater complication; so he made, as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{probably}} <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> a jolly lot of this. [...] "Ah, {{that was nice}} of you. And natural. That's all right!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--I love you," [...] he said slowly;--as though <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it, if {{he could}} have helped it. And then his arm crept slowly round her waist, as though in that also he could not help himself.|$|R

6000|$|All such participles (where no {{consonant}} {{divided the}} vowels) were normally of one syllable, permissibly of two.[378] If Mr. Masson had studied the poets who preceded Milton as he <b>has</b> studied him, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that the verse ...|$|R

6000|$|Mr Moor was a phlegmatic man; a {{self-contained}} and a reticent man. If Captain Roy {{had told him}} to get ready to sail to the moon that afternoon, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>have</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Very well, sir," [...] in the same tone and with the same expression.|$|R
6000|$|He put {{twenty or}} thirty kreutzers into {{the hand of the}} man, who {{regarded}} them with a disappointment none the less cruel because it was so patient.

50|$|During an {{interview}} with the production crew of Ultraman Nexus, Yuichi Abe noted that the most surprising part for Nexus is how the Ultra's human host changes from time to time, which is considered as the originality of the show.
