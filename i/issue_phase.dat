40|$|The {{examination}} of {{the current status of}} multicultural education among California community colleges emerged from a perspective that the inclusion of multicultural education has become a major goal of California’s leaders within the past five years. ^ The literature revealed minority students tend to have lower retention rates because they become alienated and disconnected from the campus community, and many students enter college classrooms with stereotypes and negative attitudes towards individuals outside of their racial and ethnic groups. Multicultural education is important because it helps address this <b>issue.</b> <b>Phase</b> I of this study assessed the current status of multicultural education among California community colleges. ^ Phase I of the study revealed that of the 109 California community colleges, 50 colleges had a multicultural graduation requirement in 2005 – 2006. Less than half of California’s community colleges had a multicultural graduation requirement. The findings suggest the state may be falling behind in its goal for multicultural education. The findings from the logistic regression for Research Question 3, “Are colleges with more diverse populations {{more likely to have a}} multicultural graduation requirement,” indicated no statistical significant relationships existed. ^ Phase II of this study examined the levels of multicultural education integrated into the curriculum based on a model developed from Sleeter and Grant’s typology. The researcher analyzed 120 official course outlines of record selected from 45 of the 50 colleges that had a multicultural graduation requirement in 2005 – 2006. ^ The researcher discovered that all elements of the course outlines of record were not characterized with the same level of integration in Sleeter and Grant’s typology. She discovered level one, education of the exceptional and culturally different, was not represented in any of the course outlines of record in any of the groups; Level Two, human relations, was primarily demonstrated in the fine arts courses, followed by the humanities courses; Level Three, single-group studies, was primarily demonstrated in the humanities courses followed by the social sciences and the fine arts courses; Level Four, multicultural education, was demonstrated in the social science courses, followed by the humanities courses; Level Five, education that is multicultural and social reconstructionist, was demonstrated in the social science courses. ...|$|E

The proposed (k, n) threshold digital signature scheme is proved to be as secure as the Nyberg-Ruepple or ElGamal type digital signature against chosen message attacks. It is discussed that the proposed VSS is also applicable to encryption. An application to (k, n) threshold sign-encryption is also presented. 1...|$|R

In this investigation, multiscale modelling techniques were developed to explore the efficiency in the thermal management of rechargeable batteries through employing the paraffin composite structures. A combined atomistic-continuum multiscale modelling was conducted to evaluate the thermal conductivity of paraffin reinforced with graphene or hexagonal boron-nitride nanosheet additives. In addition, heat generation during a battery service was simulated using the Newman's electrochemical model. Finally, three-dimensional heat transfer models were constructed to investigate the effectiveness of various paraffin composite structures in the thermal management of a battery system. Interestingly, {{it was found that the}} thermal conductivity of paraffin nanocomposites can be enhanced by several times but that does not yield significant improvement in the batteries thermal management over the pure paraffin. The acquired findings can be useful not only for the modelling of nanocomposites but more importantly for the improvement of phase change materials design to enhance the thermal management of rechargeable batteries and other electronic devices...|$|R

No existing stand-alone measures of spiritual wellbeing have been developed in cross-cultural and multiple linguistic contexts. Cross-cultural development of a stand-alone European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) measure of spiritual wellbeing for palliative care patients with cancer. Broadly following EORTC Quality of Life Group (QLG) guidelines for developing questionnaires, the study comprised three phases. Phase I identified relevant issues and obtained the views of palliative care patients and professionals about those <b>issues.</b> <b>Phase</b> II operationalised <b>issues</b> into items. <b>Phase</b> III pilot-tested those items with palliative care patients. Amendments to the guidelines included an intermediate Phase IIIa, and debriefing questions specific to the measure. Phase III pilot-testing recruited 113 people with incurable cancer from hospitals and hospices in six European countries and Japan. A provisional 36 -item measure ready for Phase IV field-testing, the EORTC QLQ-SWB 36, has been developed. Careful attention to translation and simultaneous development in multiple languages means items are acceptable and consistent between different countries and languages. Phase III data from 113 patients in seven countries show that the items are comprehensible across languages and cultures. Phase III patient participants in several countries used the measure {{as a starting point}} for discussing the issues it addresses. The EORTC QLG's rigorous cross-cultural development process ensures that the EORTC QLQ-SWB 36 identifies key issues for spiritual wellbeing in multiple cultural contexts, and that items are comprehensible and consistent across languages.
