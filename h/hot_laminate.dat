40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental study is presented into the thermal decomposition, softening and failure of polymer matrix laminates under combined compressive loading and one-sided heating to high temperature. A thermo-mechanical model is presented for predicting the time-to-failure of laminates supporting a static compressive stress during one-sided heating. The thermal {{component of the}} model predicts the mass loss due to polymer decomposition and through-thickness temperature profile of the <b>hot</b> <b>laminate.</b> The mass loss and temperature predictions are validated against measured data, and the agreement is good. The thermal analysis is coupled to a mechanics-based model that calculates the loss in compressive strength with increasing temperature. The model can also predict the time-to-failure of the <b>hot</b> <b>laminate</b> supporting a static compressive load. The accuracy of the model is evaluated using failure times measured in fire-under-compression load tests on a woven E-glass/vinyl ester laminate. The experimental time-to-failure values decreased with increasing heat flux (temperature) and applied compressive stress, and the model can accurately predict these failure times. The paper also examines the dimensional expansion, out-of-plane distortion and failure mechanism of laminates under combined compressive loading and heating. It is envisaged that the thermo-mechanical model is a useful tool to estimate the failure time of compressively loaded composite structures exposed to high temperature or fire...|$|E
40|$|Continuous-fibre-reinforced {{thermoplastic}} composites {{are increasingly}} used in demanding applications in, for example, the aerospace industry. The use of specialty thermoplastics such as polyetherimide (PEI), polyphenylenesulfide (PPS) and polyether-etherketone (PEEK) reinforced with glass, carbon or aramid fibres results in solvent and corrosion resistant products with high specific stiffness and high melting temperature. These composites can be moulded into complicated shapes with the rubber pressing process where a relatively <b>hot</b> <b>laminate</b> is shortly pressed between a cold rubber mould {{and a cold}} steel tool. The process is fast compared to the forming of thermosetting polymer matrix composites where extensive curing times are involved. During the moulding, residual stresses build up that cause unwanted distortions of the final product. These stresses are caused by anisotropic shrinkage and non-symmetric process conditions. The anisotropic shrinkage can be thermally induced {{or it can be}} a result of crystallization. The upper and lower mould induce non-symmetrical process conditions: the former is a highly deformable elastomeric with a very low thermal conductivity, whereas the latter is made from high stiffness steel with a high thermal conductivity. As a result, the laminate exhibits a non-uniform temperature profile through the thickness during moulding, and has different mechanical boundary conditions on the to...|$|E

It is shown, that {{the structure of the}} gradient after the <b>hot</b> press <b>laminating</b> process can be analysed using Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA). There is a distinct influence of such gradients on the laminate damage tolerance. So far only gradient laminates with a non-symmetric distribution have been realised (one-sided gradient laminate), however, the optimum gradient design for a maximum damage tolerance seems to be the double-sided gradient laminate...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} an analytical and experimental investigation of AeroVironment's Quasi-Bipolar battery concept. The modelling/battery design {{part of the}} study demonstrates that there is a trade-off between thermal and specified electrical performance. Even so, quasi-bipolar batteries can be designed, with ten times better thermal uniformity, that meet or exceed current state-of-the-art hybrid-electric vehicle battery pack performance, even using the same active materials. The thermal uniformity, power, and energy for these quasi-bipolar battery packs is projected to be very good. The experimental part of the investigation demonstrates the concept of the quasi-bipolar plate applied to a lead foil current collector wrapping around two sides of an inexpensive plastic film core. Approximately 50 quasi-biplate samples were fabricated using a <b>hot</b> <b>laminating</b> press. <b>Hot</b> lamination with "texture" between the plastic and lead shows some promise as a low cost method for fabricating the plates. Five of these plates were assembled into two cells plus one two-cell battery. Data from these test cells were compared with existing data for similar true bipolar batteries. The positive side of the plates exhibited corrosion where not protected by the active material...|$|R

40|$|Intra-ply shear appears {{during the}} forming process of <b>hot</b> {{thermoplastic}} <b>laminates</b> with a uni-directional fibre reinforcement. This paper proposes a torsion bar test to characterise the longitudinal shear mechanism, {{which can be}} performed with a standard rheometer. Sensitivity analyses showed that most reliable shear property measurements {{can be obtained by}} using torsion bar specimens with a close to square cross section. The method is implemented in practise and critically evaluated. Storage and loss moduli were determined for carbon UD/PEEK specimens at high temperatures. Non-linear material behaviour was found for relatively small shear strains. The linear regime was focussed on subsequently, where the characteristics were found to be similar to that of a visco-elastic solid or weak gel, confirmed by a dominant storage modulus and a weak frequency dependency. Future work is recommended to be focussed on the large strain regime, for which this paper provides a found basi...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{and mechanical}} {{properties of the}} Al 7075 alloy present in a <b>hot</b> roll-bonded <b>laminate</b> consisting of Al 7075 /Al 2024 layers have been characterized by high resolution electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) analysis and Vickers microhardness, respectively. The as-rolled deformation structure consisted in lamellar bands aligned parallel to the rolling direction. It was found that a post-rolling tempering at 175 ºC/ 6 h, prior to the T 6 treatment has {{a profound effect on}} the microstructure and the mechanical properties of the Al 7075 alloy. This tempering reduces the driving force for recrystallization during the usual solution treatment of 30 min {{that is part of the}} T 6 treatment. The performed procedures favour a more homogeneous precipitation during the following age hardening step and the achievement of a noticeable increase in Vickers microhardness.

40|$|Two {{aluminum}} multilayer laminates {{have been}} processed by hot roll bonding following similar processing paths. The {{first one is}} constituted by alternated Al 2024 and Al 1050 layers (ALH 19) and the second one by alternated Al 7075 and Al 1050 layers (ADH 19). The influence of the constituent materials in the multilayer laminates both during the processing at high temperature and during the subsequent mechanical characterization has been analyzed. The mechanical behavior of the as-received materials at the processing conditions has been characterized by <b>hot</b> torsion. Multilayer <b>laminates</b> have been tested at room temperature under impact Charpy tests, three-point bend tests, and shear tests on the interfaces.

40|$|Thermo-mechanical {{models are}} {{presented}} for predicting the time-to-failure of polymer laminates loaded in tension or compression and exposed to one-sided radiant heating by fire. Time-to-failure {{is defined as}} the time duration that a polymer laminate can support an externally applied load in a fire without failing. The models predict the temperature rise and through-thickness temperature profile in a <b>hot</b> decomposing <b>laminate</b> exposed to fire. Using this thermal data, mechanics-based models based on residual strength analysis are used to calculate the time-to-failure. A preliminary evaluation of the accuracy of the models is presented using failure times measured in fire-under-load tests on a woven glass/vinyl ester laminate. The model was evaluated at temperatures between - 250 and 800 ºC by testing the laminate at heat flux levels between 10 and 75 kW/m 2. It was found that the time-to-failure of the laminate decreased with increasing heat flux and increasing applied stress for both the compression and tension load conditions. The tests also revealed that the failure times were much shorter (by about one order of magnitude) when the laminate was loaded in compression. The models can predict the time-to-failure with good accuracy for both compression and tension loading for certain heat flux levels. However, because the models have only been evaluated for one type of laminate (woven glass/vinyl ester), further evaluation is necessary for other laminate systems. The paper also presents new experimental insights into the strengthening mechanisms of laminates at high temperature...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Laminated glass is comprised of multiple plates of glass bonded together with polymorphous interlayers. The interest in the use of architectural laminated glass in the construction industry has increased due to its possible advantages over monolithic glass. Some of the advantageous properties of laminated glass include a greater impact resistance, improved sound resistance, and better thermal insulation inside the structure. The most important advantage of laminated glass as compared to monolithic glass is its improved safety. Should failure of laminated glass occur, the interlayer would adhere to the surrounding glass plates. This would prevent the glass from shattering and potentially harming any inhabitants of the structure. Although these advantages are generally accepted, the performance of laminated glass is highly disputed. Of particular interest are the performance of laminated glass at various temperatures and its response to loading over a duration of time. There are two primary objectives of this thesis. First, the effect of temperature on the elastic bending stiffness of laminated glass with a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) based interlayer is to be resolved. The creep response with respect to temperature will also be observed. Second, the design method for laminated glass will be evaluated. This includes determining the effectiveness of the existing models of laminated glass. This investigation will include typical three point loading on two types of architectural laminated glass. These tests will be conducted at various temperatures to determine the effect of temperature on the bending of laminated glass. The results of these experiments show that temperature is the most influential property in the determination of the behavior of laminated glass beams. It is shown in this thesis that at cold temperatures, laminated glass approaches the performance of the true monolithic model. Furthermore, it is shown that at <b>hot</b> temperatures, <b>laminated</b> glass is bound by the performance of the layered model. The results of this thesis indicate that a return to the traditional design procedure is warranted until further research is conducted...|$|R
