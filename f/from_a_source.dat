5|$|Almost any {{substance}} containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation. It {{is likely}} that many cultures, on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of starch, independently invented beer. Bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies {{and contributed to the}} building of civilisations.|$|E
5|$|An {{active galaxy}} is a {{formation}} that emits {{a significant amount}} of its energy <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct light <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> (blue lines) and {{light from the}} source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{overlaying}} {{songs on}} the soundtrack, or employing a score, The Wire primarily uses pieces of music that emanate <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> within the scene, such as a jukebox or car radio. This kind of music is known as diegetic or source cue. This practice is rarely breached, notably for the end-of-season montages and occasionally with a brief overlap of the closing theme and the final shot.|$|E

5|$|During his {{slump in}} form, D'Oliveira was {{contacted}} by Tienie Oosthuizen, a {{director at the}} tobacco company Carreras, which was, alongside Rothmans, part of the South African Rembrandt Tobacco Corporation. Rembrandt {{had set up a}} group known as the South African Sports Foundation (SASF) to promote amateur sport. Oosthuizen told D'Oliveira that he represented Rothmans, who had sponsored matches featuring D'Oliveira while he was waiting to qualify for Worcestershire. He offered D'Oliveira work as a coach for the SASF on an annual salary of £4,000—a vast sum for a professional cricketer at the time—on the condition that he took up this role immediately {{at the end of the}} 1968 season, and thereby made himself unavailable for the MCC tour before selection took place. D'Oliveira tentatively declined, but Oosthuizen persisted, first offering to find out if he would be included in the MCC team, then telling him that his presence in that side would embarrass Vorster. D'Oliveira was aware that accepting the offer could cause many to lose respect for him as he would be abandoning the opportunity to play against South Africa, but nevertheless considered it over the following weeks. Oosthuizen repeatedly pressured him to accept. Shortly before the final Test of 1968, he offered personally to match the money that D'Oliveira told him he had been offered to make himself available for the MCC team. D'Oliveira stalled, and involved his agent, Reg Hayter. After further conversations with Oosthuizen, D'Oliveira decided to try to postpone a decision until after the team to tour South Africa was announced—Hayter had established <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> close to the selectors that D'Oliveira had a good chance of being picked.|$|E

It utilizes text-mining, web service technologies and domain knowledge, {{in order to}} extract keywords, to retrieve related records <b>from</b> <b>an</b> external <b>source,</b> and to filter the extracted keywords list. This study meets a practical challenge encountered at the School of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences at Murdoch University. The {{results indicate that the}} system can be used to increase the limited knowledge within <b>a</b> local <b>source</b> by complementing it with related records <b>from</b> <b>an</b> external <b>source.</b> Moreover, the system also reduces information overload by only retrieving a set of related information <b>from</b> <b>an</b> external <b>source.</b> Finally, domain knowledge can be used to filter the extracted keywords, in this case, selected medical keywords from the extracted keyword list...|$|R

25|$|The {{amount of}} work {{required}} to implement a filter graph depends on several factors. In the simplest case, DirectShow can create a filter graph automatically <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> such as a file or URL. If this is not possible, the developer {{may be able to}} manually create a filter graph <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> file, possibly {{with the addition of a}} custom filter, and then let DirectShow complete the filter graph by connecting the filters together. At the next level, the developer must build the filter graph from scratch by manually adding and connecting each desired filter. Finally, in cases where an essential filter is unavailable, the developer must create a custom filter before a filter graph can be built.|$|E
