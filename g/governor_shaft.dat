40|$|Abstrak:Mechanical {{governor}} is a device {{used as an}} automatic regulator of a fuel inlet system on a motor fuel. Governor is driven by an electric motor which {{is connected to the}} <b>governor</b> <b>shaft</b> using a V-belt, and rotation of the shaft governor can be adjusted as needed by using a slide regulator. The research was conducted by varying the type of governor with varying mass {{in order to get a}} big axis of rotation and the centrifugal force generated by a flyball in the theoretical methods. The result of this analysis is comparation of the speed range two type of governor with the same size. Kata kunci : bandul, kecepatan putar, poros utama governor,, porter dan proel...|$|E
50|$|Aircraft {{propellers}} {{are another}} application. The <b>governor</b> senses <b>shaft</b> RPM, and adjusts or controls {{the angle of}} the blades to vary the torque load on the engine. Thus as the aircraft speeds up (as in a dive) or slows (in climb) the RPM is held constant.|$|R
5000|$|The {{motor grader}} line {{received}} the first power-shift transmission, {{which was a}} big leap forward, in 1955. Called the Galion Grade-O-Matic drive, it utilized a torque converter, output <b>shaft</b> <b>governor</b> and power-shift transmission, providing simple two-lever control of speed and direction. The Galion T-700 garnered the world's largest grader title in 1955. Larger {{than anything else in}} the grader industry, it boasted [...] and an operating weight of over 40,000 pounds.|$|R
5000|$|Smith {{specifically}} {{developed the}} design of a [...] "high-speed steam engine, with <b>shaft</b> <b>governor,</b> using the inertia principle... put into operation in connection with a Brush dynamo, operating 40 arc lights." [...] As representative of a Michigan electrical lighting company, he installed electrical installation. Among others he supplied the SM Stillman Hotel, Cleveland, Ohio with an electric light plant, and 1,000 lights, making that hotel first in the United States lighted exclusively and continuously by electricity.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} model is {{developed for the}} dynamics of a tilting proprotor aircraft engine and drive train, including a rotor speed <b>governor</b> and interconnect <b>shaft.</b> The dynamic stability of a proprotor and cantilever wing is calculated, including the engine-transmission-governor model. It is concluded that the rotor behaves much as if windmilling as far as its dynamic behavior is concerned, with some influence of the turboshaft engine inertia and damping. The interconnect shaft has a significant influence on the antisymmetric dynamics of proprotor aircraft. The proprotor aerodynamics model is extended to include reverse flow, and a refinement on the method {{used to calculate the}} kinematic pitch-bending coupling of the blade is developed...|$|R
40|$|DESCRIPTION. The Gray {{horizontal}} engine {{is of the}} 4 Cycle single acting type and has a single cylinder. It is fitted with a reciprocating fuel pump, which forces the gasoline into the ordinary type or jet carburettor. The pump action is determined by a <b>shaft</b> <b>governor,</b> which has a range of from 200 to 400 R. P. M's., but is very erratic at the lower speeds. When the speed rises above that for which the governor is set, the exhaust valve is held open, and the automatic inlet valve remains closed and by a system of levers, the pump is prevented from delivering its charge.
