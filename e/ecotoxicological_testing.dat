50|$|There are two {{categories}} of anatoxin-a detection methods. Biological methods have involved administration of samples to mice and other organisms more commonly used in <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>testing,</b> such as brine shrimp (Artemia salina), larvae of the freshwater crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus, and various insect larvae. Problems with this methodology include an inability {{to determine whether it}} is anatoxin-a or another neurotoxin that causes the resulting deaths. Large amounts of sample material are also needed for such testing. In addition to the biological methods, scientists have used chromatography to detect anatoxin-a. This is complicated by the rapid degradation of the toxin and the lack of commercially available standards for anatoxin-a.|$|E
50|$|Recently, S. stercoraria was {{approved}} {{as a standard}} required test species for <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>testing.</b> This includes evaluating the residues of veterinary drugs in livestock dung. Yellow dung flies are {{a key part of}} decomposing waste in pastures, which is key to preventing the spread of endoparasites and returning nutrients to the soil. The species’ diet also serves to reduce the abundance of pest flies. To test a chemical's toxicity, the chemical is mixed with bovine faeces, to which yellow dung fly eggs are added. Then, endpoints, such as sex and number of emerged adult flies, retardation of emergence, morphological change, and developmental rate, are measured and analyzed to determine toxicity. A great deal of research has been done on the effects of avermectins on populations of S. stercoraria. Avermectins are used to control endoparasites in livestock. The resulting dung contains drug residues that can have unintentional adverse effects on yellow dung fly populations, such as increased mutations and decreased offspring viability. If the use of such drugs in agriculture is not carefully monitored, considerable economic losses could occur.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>testing</b> of blood cholesterol lowering drugs.

In addition, clofibric acid – the metabolite of fibrates was tested. Residues of these drugs are found mainly in the aquatic ecosystem, that is why tests of aquatic organisms have been used to evaluate ecotoxicity. Test organisms were Thamnocephalus platyurus, Lemna minor and Vibrio fischeri. LC 50, EC 50 and IC 50 values were determined on the basis of test results.

40|$|For the {{assessment}} of contaminated or remediated soils, aside from chemical analyses, <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>tests</b> are performed which focus on the retention function of soils (determined by tests with aqueous soil extracts) and on the habitat function (determined by tests with soil).

40|$|AbstractSince the {{development}} of the TIE (Toxicity Identification and Evaluation) in 1988 it has been assumed that the capacity of EDTA and sodium thiosulfate to complex some metals, and thus remove their toxicity, can be applied to both freshwater and seawater <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>tests</b> and the results subsequently interpreted. However, it is now known that there is a wide variability in the extent of this complexation. In this context, the removal of toxicity caused by the presence of Hg 2 +, Cd 2 +, Cu 2 +, Cr 6 +, Zn 2 +, Ni 2 +, Pb 2 +, Ag 1 + and Se 2 +, through metal complexation by EDTA and sodium thiosulfate, in relation to the performance of embryo-larval tests with the sea urchin Arbacia lixula was investigated. It was observed that EDTA was capable of removing the toxicity of Pb 2 +, Zn 2 + and Cu 2 + while sodium thiosulfate only reduced the toxicity of Ag 1 +. Compared to the complexation observed in freshwater <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>tests,</b> the complexing agents used in this study (EDTA and sodium thiosulfate) have a lower capacity to complex metals in the marine <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>test</b> with A. lixula...|$|R

40|$|Oxygen optical microsensors are a {{sensitive}} method to monitor oxygen {{production and consumption}} in soils, sediments, and aquatic systems. They have been used widely to analyze the activity and metabolism of aerobic organisms, also in <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>tests.</b> We aimed to assess the suitability of a contact-free device to measure cell respiration and photosynthesis for future applications in <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>tests.</b> One {{of the most important}} advantages of this modified method is that respiration and photosynthesis of test organisms which are contaminated with test chemicals can be measured without contact between sensor and test medium. Therefore, it avoids sensor contamination. In an array of calibration tests with Chlorella vulgaris in green algae medium, algal cell activity was well-correlated with cell counts. Results clearly showed that, compared to O 2 evolution rate, O 2 assimilation rate measured by oxygen optical microsensors in a contact-free manner could better predict the algae cell counts. In a second test series we measured O 2 assimilation rate in soil from a field experiment inoculated with different communities of terrestrial algae. No significant difference was observed when comparing measurements of their activity with microsensors to results obtained with the Warburg respiratory manometer. However, optical microsensors are much faster and more easily applied than the traditional manometer. Therefore, the developed method appears promising for application in <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>tests</b> in the future...|$|R
40|$|Pollution-induced {{community}} tolerance (PICT) as an <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>test</b> {{system has}} been claimed to detect pollutant effects highly specifically and sensitively. However, the specificity might be limited by the occurrence of cotolerance. Another limitation of the application of any <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>test</b> system lies in variation of the measured responses. We tested the variation and the occurrence of cotolerance experimentally, using antibiotics as toxicants, soil microcosms as microbial communities, and tolerance determination in Biolog plates as PICT detection test. Bacteria have been discussed as being prone to multiple tolerances due to the possible accumulation of multiple resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. However, in our experiments, cotolerance occurred only between antibiotics of the same group (oxytetracycline and tetracycline), as expected from their identical mode of action. Cotolerance between oxytetracycline and tylosin in soil microcosms exposed to oxytetracycline was low, as was cotolerance to oxytetracycline in tylosin-exposed microcosms. We conclude that tolerance development to antibiotics in soils reflects the actual selection pressure rather than a general pattern of multiple resistances. Concerning variation, the PICT effect of tetracycline was well reproducible in two consecutive years. The response variation linked to PICT experiments in controlled microcosms was {{comparable to that of}} <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>test</b> systems of equivalent complexity. In conclusion, our results support an application of the PICT methodology as an effective means to study the soil ecotoxicology of antibiotics...|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{this study}} put a {{spotlight}} on the growth behavior of aquatic macrophytes, in particular amphibious ones, and its consequences for <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>tests.</b> High shoot growth rates of amphibious macrophytes, which become submerged, are primarily a result of hormone-regulated endogenous processes and only to a part a result of photosynthetic carbon assimilation.|$|R
30|$|Implementation of {{the current}} ERA concept of GM crops in the EU {{is based on an}} {{interpretation}} of the EU regulations that focuses almost exclusively on the isolated bacteria-produced novel proteins with little consideration of the whole plant. Therefore, testing procedures for the effect assessment of GM plants on non-target organisms largely follow the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>testing</b> strategy developed for pesticides. This presumes that any potential adverse effect of the whole GM plant and the plant-produced novel compound can be extrapolated from testing of the isolated bacteria-produced novel compound or can be detected in agronomic field trials. This has led to persisting scientific criticism.|$|E
