5000|$|There {{are several}} {{projects}} and proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, {{some of which}} have been attempted, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear. [...] One of the primary methods that has been developed are freshwater diversions, which extract water from Mississippi River at strategic locations and transport fresh water and silt from the river through aqueducts and then pump and distribute them into nearby estuaries. [...] This process invigorates <b>freshwater</b> <b>plant</b> life and re-introduces silt into the estuaries. [...] Freshwater diversions have not been without controversy and have encountered some opposition, primarily from oyster harvesters who believe that the current high level salinity is needed in their state-licensed zones in order to maintain healthy production. [...] Another method of coastal restoration is the direct planting of new marsh grasses and other forms of sustainable plant life into affected areas. [...] There is the practice of seeding, which may be turn out to be more productive than direct planting, which often entails the dropping large amounts of seeds from crop-dusters intended to grow into freshwater plants. [...] Mangrove seeds have been tried because when grown they have the benefit of reducing marsh water salinity. [...] Transporting already-dredged material from the Mississippi river to marshes, swamps, and barrier islands is also an option. [...] Some have proposed the removal of river levees in certain low-populated areas to allow fresh water and silt dispersion into marshes, though this method is controversial and has yet to be attempted.|$|E

40|$|Upland {{headwater}} streams {{are important}} sources of freshwater in mountainous temperate to sub-arctic latitude European countries like Scotland. Yet much less {{is known about}} the ecology of small, characteristically oligotrophic, mountain streams supporting periphyton and aquatic bryophyte dominated vegetation, and their potential bioindicator capacity of environmental water quality, than lowland rivers impacted by anthropogenic disturbance, in this context. This scarcity of knowledge has significant implications for the success of the recently implemented Water Framework Directive (WFD: 2000 / 60 /EC). The WFD is a major piece of environmental legislation for water policy and sustainable water management in Europe. New contributions are fundamental to environment agencies, such as the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), tasked with the responsibility of enforcing WFD statutory requirements and developing effective biomonitoring tools for assessing water quality status in Scotland. A major aim of the WFD is to achieve at least ‘good’ ecological status of inland waterbodies by 2015. Further, in doing so, to ascertain ecological benchmark communities of near-pristine (or minimally-impacted) reference conditions as indicators of high water quality status. The objective is to improve understanding of the environmental processes driving the production and diversity of <b>freshwater</b> <b>plant</b> species-assemblages in upland streams. Such information can be used for assessing perturbations threatening the ecological integrity of rivers impacted by anthropogenic disturbances (human pressure). This enables environment agencies such as SEPA, to respond appropriately by implementing corrective measures and sustainable management strategies. This project monitored a range of near-pristine headwater streams of contrasting underlying geology in the Scottish Highlands. The approach adopted was compatible with current WFD river characterisation and biomonitoring strategies. These were used to investigate the structural and functional response of <b>freshwater</b> <b>plant</b> communities (chiefly diatoms and other algal groups; aquatic bryophyte and vascular submerged macrophyte vegetation) to environmental drivers (e. g. flow, substrate morphology, nutrient inputs, water chemistry, underwater light availability). The work was carried out with the aim of contributing to future development of baseline monitoring tools for assessing upland stream habitat quality in Scotland.

30|$|The final {{pathways}} {{mentioned here}} are the trades in ornamental (predominantly aquarium and watergarden) and aquaculture species. Ornamental introductions have been especially important in freshwater ecosystems, accounting for 8 % of established non-native animal species. Ornamental introductions also appear to be by far the dominant pathway for introduction of aquatic plants. For example, in Great Britain 22 of 31 established non-native <b>freshwater</b> <b>plant</b> species were introduced for the ornamental trade [8]. The aquaculture trade has unintentionally introduced {{a large number of}} non-native aquatic species as contaminants of intentionally introduced species such as fish or shellfish. This is true for both marine and freshwater habitats. For example, the unintentional introduction and spread of the brown algae Sargassum muticum, the Japanease kelp Undaria pinnatifida, and the snail Ocinebrellus inornatus, as well as the oyster parasites Mytilicola orientalis and Myicola ostreae, all occurred because these species inadvertently arrived associated with marine shellfish imported from Asia to Europe for aquaculture [36].|$|E
40|$|Human impacts {{have become}} a {{dominant}} force in shaping Earth’s biosphere. One major consequence is the global reshuffling of species, both through intentional introductions, but also unintentional because human infrastructure benefits the movement of certain species. Consequently, ecosystems are increasingly a mix of native and introduced species and can be termed novel communities. Native species and communities are judged on, and valued for, their provisioning of ecosystem functions, which are weighed against any negative impacts. Of introduced species, mainly negative impacts are studied, because of their evolutionary novelty they are assumed threaten native ecosystems, habitats and species. Yet, although introduced species are increasingly abundant, {{little is known about}} whether they provide desirable ecosystem functions. The Netherlands contains many valuable freshwater ecosystems. In these systems, <b>freshwater</b> <b>plants</b> provide food to fish, waterfowl and macroinvertebrates, but they also increase habitat structure, inhibit phytoplankton blooms and regulate greenhouse emissions. Many <b>freshwater</b> <b>plants</b> have locally disappear in recent decades due to human impacts on lakes, rivers and ponds, and expensive measures were taken to restore these systems. Yet, in many cases these restored freshwaters are colonised by introduced <b>freshwater</b> <b>plants,</b> which are subsequently eradicated or heavily managed. Dutch freshwaters contain dozens of introduced <b>freshwater</b> <b>plants,</b> yet little is known on the functions that these species provide. The main question of this thesis is whether introduced freshwater species provide ecosystem functions, despite lacking evolutionary history. At the heart is that a judgement of introduced species needs to consider both costs and benefits. In a series of mesocosm and laboratory experiments the functioning of large groups of native and introduced species were compared. Besides testing the role of plant origin in ecosystem functioning, also the role of traits was studied. In conclusion, native and introduced <b>freshwater</b> <b>plants</b> were similar in their provisioning of ecosystem functions. Ecosystem functioning varied strongly with plant identity, and depended on multiple plant traits. Because plant traits show biogeographic patterns, the biogeographic origin of plants is more informative than the traditional native versus introduced dichotomy. In addition, the growth form and tolerance of plants both explained variance in ecosystem functioning. Many introduced plants are well adapted to the human-impacted ecosystems, so combined with the beneficial functions that they provide, introduced plants can help maintain ecosystem functioning in these disturbed ecosystems. Therefore, these results indicate that evolutionary novelty is no persistent barrier in the ecosystem functioning of novel communities. These findings do not imply that introduced species cause no negative impacts. Certain introduced species have negative impacts just like native weeds or pests. Critically, the findings point out that humans may not want to maintain double standards in judging native and introduced species...|$|R

40|$|Flow–plant {{interactions}} are experimentally investigated at leaf, stem, and shoot scales in an open-channel flume {{at a range}} of Reynolds numbers. The experiments included measurements of instantaneous drag forces acting on leaves, stems, and shoots of the common <b>freshwater</b> <b>plant</b> species Glyceria fluitans, complemented with velocity measurements, high-resolution video recordings, and biomechanical tests of leaf and stem properties. The analyses of bulk statistics, power spectral densities, transfer functions, and cross-correlations of measured velocities and drag forces revealed that flow characteristics, drag force, and plant biomechanical and morphological properties are strongly interconnected and scale-dependent. The plant element–flow interactions can be subdivided into two classes: (I) passive interactions when the drag variability {{is due to the}} time variability of the wetted and frontal areas and squared approach velocity (due to the large-scale turbulence); and (II) active interactions representing a range of element-specific instabilities that depend on the element flexural rigidity and morphology.

40|$|Oxygen {{released}} by the roots of submerged plants may oxidize organic compounds from the roots and reduced substances continuously supplied by diffusion from the surrounding anoxic hydrosoil. We provide here the first visualization of this gradient environment obtained by microsensor analysis of oxygen in the rhizosphere of the <b>freshwater</b> <b>plant</b> Littorella uniflora (L.) Ascherson. The plants were rooted in an agar medium, in which amorphous FeS provided the main oxygen sink. The oxygen concentration at the root surface ranged from 20 to 450 [mu]M (atmospheric saturation = 280 [mu]M) between darkness and saturating light, and the oxic shell surrounding the roots varied from about 0. 5 to 5 mm in thickness. The oxygen flux from the roots was a saturating function of the incident light intensity on the leaves, and the oxygen released was consumed mainly at the fluctuating oxic/anoxic interface. The oxic zones around individual roots are under dynamic control by light, root morphology, root density, and sediment reducing capacity, and, therefore, oxygen concentrations {{should be subject to}} substantial diurnal fluctuations in dense Littorella populations in nutrient-poor sediments...|$|E
