In order to control the quality, {{it is necessary for}} establishing a rapid method for quality analysis of hwa-mei. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been recognized to be a rapid technique for the food analysis. This study is to investigate the feasibility of analyzing hwa-mei quality including titratable acidity、total soluble solids、salinity and saccharin by NIRS. The best statistical mathematical treatments for calibration equations by NIT were summarized as follows : (1) for the calibration equation of titratable acidity, the step-up regression without <b>derivative</b> <b>treatment</b> was used in the range 700 - 2500 nm and the interval used was 10 nm; (2) for the calibration equations of total soluble soilds and salinity, the step-up regression with 1 st <b>derivative</b> <b>treatment</b> was used in the range 700 - 2500 nm and the interval used was 10 nm;and (3) for the calibration equation of saccharin, the step-up regression with 1 st <b>derivative</b> <b>treatment</b> was used in the range 700 - 2500 nm and the interval used was 8 nm. The calibration curves by NIT for titratable acidity、total soluble solids and salinity using extract solution diluted 25 times had better prediction result than that diluted 81 times. Comparing the prediction results of the calibration curves by NIT and NIR, the prediction by NIT is better than that by NIR. The accuracy for the total soluble soilds and salinity was better than that for the two others. If using RPD assessment, the predicting ability of the calibration curves for total soluble soilds was classified to 〝Good〞grade and could be used as 〝Quality control〞, and the predicting ability of the calibration curves for salinity was classified to 〝Superior〞grade and could be used as 〝As good as reference〞. 在臺灣，話梅是受消費者喜愛的蜜餞產品之一，然而在製造時往往添加過量的食鹽及人工甜味劑之糖精和賽克拉美等，其中糖精和賽克拉美之添加量往往超過國家的用量標準。又由於國人對健康的重視，紛紛走向避免攝取過高的糖分及鹽分之生活習慣，因此造成消費者對話梅之購買慾大減。所以為了消費者食的健康、提昇消費者對話梅品質的信心及對進出口話梅的品質管制，故需準確、快速的品質檢測方法對話梅產品進行檢測。而近紅外線光譜技術 (NIRS) 為近年來公認快速檢驗之方法，故本研究針對以 (NIRS) 應用於分析話梅品質包括鹽度、可滴定酸度、可溶性固形物及糖精含量之可行性加以探討。 於製備穿透光譜檢量線之最適條件為 (1) 可滴定酸度檢量線： 所用的最適條件為 700 - 2500 nm (10 nm 為間距) 光譜範圍，配合 step-up 迴歸方法和光譜不經微分處理的條件；(2) 可溶性固形物及 鹽度檢量線：所用的最適條件為 700 - 2500 nm (10 nm 為間距) 光譜 範圍，配合 step-up 迴歸方法和光譜經一次微分處理的條件；(3) 糖 精檢量線：所用的最適條件為 700 - 2500 nm (8 nm 為間距) 光譜範圍 ，配合step-up 迴歸方法和光譜經一次微分處理的條件。 針對以稀釋 81 倍及 25 倍的話梅萃取液建立之可滴定酸度、可 溶性固形物和鹽度之穿透光譜檢量線而言， 25 倍稀釋者之預測效果較 稀釋 81 倍者為佳。 比較穿透掃瞄及反射掃瞄兩種方式所建立之檢量線其預測效果， 不管是那種成分皆以穿透式掃瞄所建立之檢量線的預測效果比反射式 掃瞄所建立者為佳，其中又以所建立之鹽度和可溶性固形物檢量線之 預測效果最佳。若以 RPD 評估方法評估，其可溶性固形物檢量線達 〝Good〞級，表示可用於話梅〝Quality control〞之用；鹽度檢量線 達〝Superior〞級，可做話梅〝As good as reference〞之用...|$|R

As {{a part of our}} ongoing chemistry on Os-Tp complexes we report here the unexpected role of the B-H unit of the ligand, which acts as a claw-tail of the scorpionate to abstract an unsaturated group from the saturated metal center, allowing a subsequent reaction in another ligand. [Results]: The ethylene-pyridyl derivative OsTp{η 1 -C[NC 5 H 3 Me]}(η 2 -CH 2 =CH 2) (PiPr 3) reacts with two equivalents of phenylacetylene or 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -propyn- 1 -ol to give the corresponding alkynyl-vinylidene <b>derivatives.</b> <b>Treatment</b> of the hydroxyalkynyl-hydroxyvinylidene derivative with aluminium oxide promotes the dehydration of the hydroxyvinylidene to allenylidene and the subsequent isomerization of the hydroxyalkynyl ligand into an α,β-unsaturated acyl group. The B-H bond of the Tp ligand abstracts the allenylidene ligand from the metal center providing an allenyltris(pyrazolyl) borate ligand. As a result of the migration, the decarbonylation of the acyl group takes place to form the alkenyl-carbonyl derivative OsTpCH=C=CPh 2 (CH=CPh 2) (CO) (PiPr 3). The isomerization of the allenyl substituent of the borate ligand to alkynyl is promoted by a weak base as acetonitrile.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The human kidney-specific {{chloride}} channels ClC-Ka (rodent ClC-K 1) and ClC-Kb (rodent ClC-K 2) {{are important}} determinants of renal function, participating to urine concentration {{and blood pressure}} regulation mechanisms. Here we tested the hypothesis that these chloride channels could represent new drug targets for inducing diuretic and antihypertensive effects. METHODS: To this purpose, the CLC-K blockers benzofuran derivatives MT- 189 and RT- 93 (10, 50, 100  mg/kg), were acutely administered by gavage in Wistar rats, and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters determined by functional, bioanalytical, biochemical and molecular biology assays. RESULTS: Plasma concentration values for MT- 189 and RT- 93 were indicative of good bioavailability. Both MT- 189 and RT- 93 dose-dependently increased urine volume without affecting electrolyte balance. A comparable reduction of SBP was observed in rats after MT- 189, RT- 93 or furosemide administration. Benzofuran <b>derivatives</b> <b>treatment</b> did not affect kidney CLC-K mRNA level or inner medulla osmolality, whereas a significant vasopressin-independent down-regulation of aquaporin water channel type 2 was observed at protein and transcriptional levels. In rats treated with benzofuran derivatives, the observed polyuria was mainly water diuresis; this finding indirectly supports a cross-talk between chloride and water transport in nephron. Moreover, preliminary in-vitro evaluation of the drugs capability to cross the blood-inner ear barrier suggests that these compounds have a limited ability to induce potential auditory side effects. CONCLUSION: CLC-K blockers may represent {{a new class of}} drugs for the treatment of conditions associated with expanded extracellular volume, with a hopeful high therapeutic potential for hypertensive patients carrying ClC-K gain-of-function polymorphisms...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the application of}} (arene) Cr(CO) 3 methodology to the Stereoselective and enantioselective synthesis of substituted arenes. Chapter one reviews the main methods of preparation and decomplexation of (arene) Cr(CO) 3 complexes and the electronic and steric influences of the Cr(CO) 3 unit on the arene. Chapter two demonstrates that the benzylic oxygen directing effect in complexation reactions operates via a direct oxygen bond to the incoming metal unit. Attachment of bulky ft-acceptor groups, such as t-butyldimethylsilyl, to the benzylic oxygen overrides this directing effect. Chapter three {{describes the}} regioselective Cl functionalisation of the cryptopine skeleton. Complexation of dihydrocrytopine gives only a single product, the relative configuration of the product being determined using an X-ray crystal structure analysis. Subsequent alkylation of the O-methyl derivative gives Cl alkylated products. Chapter four describes the regioselective ortho functionalisation of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine <b>derivatives.</b> <b>Treatment</b> of (1 S, 2 R) -(N,O-dimethylpseudoephedrine) Cr(CO) 3 with n -butyllithium leads to exclusive removal of the pro-(R) ortho proton. The observed stereoselectivity arises via</em deprotonation from cyclic bidentate five-membered chelates. Chapter five describes the regioselective C 4 and C 5 functionalisation of (hydrocotarnine) Cr(CO) 3. Complexation of 1 -methylhydrocotarnine occurs to give exclusively the exo - 1 -methyl derivative. Further functionalisation to give the 1, 5 - and 4, 5 -dimethyl products is also described. Chapter six describes the synthesis of ortho substituted (benzaldehyde) Cr(CO) 3 complexes. Chiral material is available via preferential kinetic hydrolysis of, or classical separation of, the L-valinol derived imines. Chapter seven describes the Stereoselective addition of nucleophiles to (o -anisaldehyde) Cr(CO) 3 and (o-trialkylsilylbenzaldehyde) Cr(CO) 3. With (o -anisaldehyde) - Cr(CO) 3 the additions are completely stereoselective giving the (RR,SS) diastereoisomer. With (o -trialkylsilylbenzaldehyde) Cr(CO) 3 the ratio of products {{is influenced by the}} nature of Lewis acidic species present. Chapter eight describes the Stereoselective benzylic elaboration of (o -methoxybenzyl methyl ether) Cr(CO) 3 achieved via selective removal of the exo benzylic proton from transition states with the methoxy groups anti to each other. </p...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 {{reviews the}} {{literature}} concerning the principal synthetic routes to hydroxyphosphine transition-metal complexes and their reactions, which {{have led to}} the formation of some unusual diphosphoxane derivatives. The preparation and characterization of aminophosphine complexes of chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten are presented in Chapter 2. The phosphorus-nitrogen bond is readily cleaved by HC 1 gas and other aqueous acids, to afford phosphorus-chlorine and phosphorus-oxygen bonded derivatives. The chromium and tungsten aminophosphine complexes have been found to be particularly useful for the preparation of chlorodiphenylphosphine derivatives. In addition their reactions with alcohols have also been investigated. The study of aminophosphine complexes has been extended to Pt(II) derivatives in Chapter 3. Cleavage of the phosphorus-nitrogen bond in these complexes is again observed to proceed smoothly with gaseous HC 1 and aqueous HC 1, but not with other aqueous acids. Treatment of the chlorodiphenylphosphine complex, cis-[PtC 12 (PPh 2 C 1) 2], with sodium sulphide afforded a four-membered metallacycle. A similar four-membered metallacycle was also obtained by refluxing the hydroxyphosphine complex, cis-[PtC 12 (PPh 2 OH) 2], in toluene for 12 h. Other reactions of the hydroxyphosphine complex with chlorodiphenylphosphine and dichlorophenyl- phosphine {{led to the formation of}} six-membered ring systems. The molecular structure of the complex [NHEt 3] [Pt(C?CPh) (Ph 2 PO) 2 (Ph 2 POH) ] has been established by X-ray crystallography and reveals an unsymmetrical hydrogen-bridged system. Some of the complexes have been characterised via their 1, 2 -dithiolene <b>derivatives.</b> <b>Treatment</b> of cis-[PtC 12 (PNEt 2 Ph 2) 2] with diphenacyl sulphone in the presence of silver(I) oxide afforded the metallathietane- 3, 3 -dioxide complex, L 2 Pt-CHR-S (O) 2 -CHR (L=Ph 2 PNEt 2; R = C(O) Ph). The final chapter describes the preparation of some Rh(I) and Ir(I) aminophosphine complexes. Their oxidative addition reactions with methyl iodide, tetracyanoethylene, dioxygen, and HC 1 gas have been investigated. In addition, some interesting metal-mercury bonded complexes were prepared by the treatment of trans-[IrC 1 (CO) (PNEt 2 Ph 2) 2] with mercuric halides, HgX 2 (X=C 1, Br or I). Satellite peaks due to mercury- 199 coupling (I= 1 / 2, 16. 9 %) were readily observed in the 31 P-{lcub} 1 H{rcub} n. m. r. spectra...|$|E

The dihydrofurans obtained were subjected to hydrogenation to afford spiro tetrahydrofuran derivatives in nearly quantitative yields (98 - 99 %).

40|$|The {{utility of}} near {{infrared}} spectroscopy as a non-invasive technique {{for the assessment}} of internal eating quality parameters of mandarin fruit (Citrus reticulata cv. Imperial) was assessed. The calibration procedure for the attributes of TSS (total soluble solids) and DM (dry matter) was optimised with respect to a reference sampling technique, scan averaging, spectral window, data pre-treatment (in terms of <b>derivative</b> <b>treatment</b> and scatter correction routine) and regression procedure. The recommended procedure involved sampling of an equatorial position on the fruit with 1 scan per spectrum, and modified partial least squares model development on a 720 – 950 -nm window, pre-treated as first derivative absorbance data (gap size of 4 data points) with standard normal variance and detrend scatter correction. Calibration model performance for the attributes of TSS and DM content was encouraging (typical Rc 2 of > 0. 75 and 0. 90, respectively; typical root mean squared standard error of calibration of < 0. 4 and 0. 6 %, respectively), whereas that for juiciness and total acidity was unacceptable. The robustness of the TSS and DM calibrations across new populations of fruit is documented in a companion study...|$|R
