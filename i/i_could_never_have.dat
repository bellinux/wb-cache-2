Writing to Liszt, he {{said that}} the people there were musically unsophisticated, but he saw this as an opportunity [...] "...for an impact <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> achieved in Prague." [...] Within a few weeks of his arrival, he had given his first recital, opened a music school that was rapidly overwhelmed by applications, and become conductor of the Gothenburg Society for Classical Choral Music. In a few months Smetana had achieved both professional and social recognition in the city, although he found little time for composition; two intended orchestral works, provisionally entitled Frithjof and The Viking's Voyage, were sketched but abandoned.|$|E
500|$|In 1897, Sullivan {{had agreed}} to compose music for Kipling's poem Recessional, but he never {{completed}} the song. When asked to set [...] "The Absent-Minded Beggar" [...] to music two years later, Sullivan found Kipling's verses so difficult to set that he told his diary, [...] "if it wasn't for charity's sake, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> undertaken the task". Still, the experienced composer completed the music in four days, on 5 November 1899, and it was published by Enoch & Sons for the Daily Mail. The first public performance was sung by John Coates, under Sullivan's baton, at the Alhambra Theatre on 13 November 1899, to a [...] "magnificent reception" [...] of an overflowing theatre. In 1900, [...] "Kipling travelled to South Africa to help distribute the supplies bought with the funds raised by the song." ...|$|E
500|$|Tracy's health {{declined}} {{significantly in}} the 1960s, and Hepburn took a five-year break in her career to care for him. She moved into Tracy's house for this period, and was {{with him when he}} died on June 10, 1967. Out of consideration for Tracy's family, she did not attend his funeral. It was only after Louise Tracy's death, in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak publicly about her feelings for her frequent co-star. In response to the question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their relationship, she said, [...] "I honestly don't know. I can only say that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> left him." [...] She claimed to not know how he felt about her and that they [...] "just passed twenty-seven years [...] together in what was to me absolute bliss." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1973–74 NBA {{season was}} to be West's last as a player. Now 36 years old, the veteran guard {{averaged}} 20.3points, 3.7rebounds and 6.6assists per game. In two newly introduced statistics, steals and blocks, he was credited with 2.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per game. Despite playing only 31 games due to a strained groin, West was still regarded as an elite guard, earning another callup into his final All-Star Game. Without Chamberlain, who had ended his NBA career, the Lakers won 47 games and lost in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks. After this loss, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages. West wanted to re-negotiate his contract and keep playing, however he said Cooke [...] "basically told my agent to go to hell. I felt I was deceived. When you feel that you’re deceived you don’t {{want any part of}} the organization that deceived you. I could’ve played another very good year. Every athlete says that. But I could’ve, and I knew I could’ve. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> played for the Lakers again, and I wasn’t going to play for anybody else." [...] At the time of his departure, West had scored more points than any Laker in NBA history.|$|E
500|$|On 30 August 1942, at {{the time}} when Stanley was {{preparing}} the draft drawings of the murals, the Japanese began an action which would become known as the Selarang Barracks Incident. It was an incident concerning seventeen thousand Anglo-Australian POWs, who were forced to vacate their buildings and be exposed for nearly five days in the open without water or sanitation for refusing to sign a [...] "No Escape Pledge". Against this backdrop, Stanley began to paint the murals. No one had asked the Japanese for permission to draw and at no stage did they interfere with his work. Considering the purpose of the murals, Stanley felt that the Chapel was basically dedicated to peace and reconciliation, and so he choose universal themes for the murals which would embrace all mankind. Paint was not readily available in the camp, but with the aid of the other prisoners, who unquestionably put themselves at great risk, materials to make the paint were gradually acquired—brown camouflage paint, a small amount of crimson paint, white oil paint and billiard chalk were found and brought for Stanley use. Despite still being very ill, Stanley set to work on the murals in early September 1942. His illness meant that he could only paint for a limited period each day, for perhaps 15 minutes at a time followed by a rest. To compensate {{as much as he could}} for the lack of coloured paint, Stanley resorted to using large brush strokes and big areas of solid colour when painting. In September 1942, a few weeks after Stanley began painting the murals, he was informed that his work party was to be sent north to Thailand to work on the Thai-Burma Railway. A colonel in charge of the hospital, who knew of his work-in-progress murals, intervened to have Stanley transferred back to the hospital so that he could continue on his work in the Chapel. Most of Stanley's unit who went to the Thai-Burma Railway never returned. Stanley recounted: [...] "Had I gone with them, most certainly, I would have died. So the murals very directly saved my life in the way <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> foreseen... It's a terrible sense of debt... that one feels to the chapel." ...|$|E

He received his accolade from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on 8 July 2003. Scott admitted feeling [...] "stunned and truly humbled" [...] after the ceremony, saying, [...] "As a boy growing up in South Shields, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> imagined that I would receive such a special recognition. I am truly humbled to receive this treasured award and believe it also further recognises the excellence of the British film industry." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{nearly two}} hours Hodges’ {{regiment}} was able to prevent {{the development of the}} French vanguard, and covered the retreat of the surprised foragers before retiring his troops to a nearby mill (see map). By 11:00, Marlborough had arrived within sight of the engagement. Noticing Hodges was under attack by several French batteries, the English commander ordered the embattled colonel to withdraw to a hill east of Walcourt, behind which the main Allied force was forming. Waldeck later commented to William – [...] " [...] and the English, who are with him, have accomplished miracles, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> believed that so many of the English would show such a joie de combattre." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stanley Donen, {{brought to}} Hollywood by Kelly {{to be his}} {{assistant}} choreographer, received co-director credit for On the Town. According to Kelly: [...] "...when you are involved in doing choreography for film you must have expert assistants. I needed one to watch my performance, and one {{to work with the}} cameraman on the timing..without such people as Stanley, Carol Haney and Jeanne Coyne <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> done these things. When we came to do On the Town, I knew it was time for Stanley to get screen credit because we weren't boss-assistant anymore but co-creators." [...] Together, they opened up the musical form, taking the film musical out of the studio and into real locations, with Donen taking responsibility for the staging and Kelly handling the choreography. Kelly went much further than before in introducing modern ballet into his dance sequences, going so far in the [...] "Day in New York" [...] routine as to substitute four leading ballet specialists for Sinatra, Munshin, Garrett and Miller.|$|E
