As a result of this reorganization, the 525th Air Defense Group activated at New Castle. The reorganization also resulted in the wing adding the radar <b>detection,</b> <b>control</b> and warning mission, and it was assigned four Aircraft Control & Warning Squadrons (AC Sq) to perform this mission, although one was reassigned a few months later. In the same reorganization, the wing was reassigned to the 26th Air Division. Fighter squadrons of the wing converted to newer aircraft during the year, the 48th FIS joined the other squadrons of the wing in flying Starfires, although the 95th FIS abandoned its Starfires for F-86 Sabres.|$|E
25|$|The US has an elaborate, {{interdepartmental}} {{regulatory system}} to evaluate new genetically modified foods and crops.
