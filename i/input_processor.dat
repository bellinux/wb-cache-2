40|$|Abstract. Iteratee IO is a {{style of}} {{incremental}} input processing with precise resource control. The style encourages building <b>input</b> <b>processors</b> from a user-extensible set of primitives by chaining, layering, pairing and other modes of compositions. The programmer is still able, where needed, to precisely control look-ahead, the allocation of buffers, file descriptors and other resources. The style is especially suitable for processing of com-munication streams, large amount of data, and data undergone several levels of encoding such as pickling, compression, chunking, framing. It {{has been used for}} programming high-performance (HTTP) servers and web frameworks, in computational linguistics and financial trading. We exposit programming with iteratees, contrasting them with Lazy IO and the Handle-based, stdio-like IO. We relate them to online parser com-binators. We introduce a simple implementation as free monads, which lets us formally reason with iteratees. As an example, we validate several equational laws and use them to optimize iteratee programs. The simple implementation helps understand existing implementations of iteratees and derive new ones. “We should have some ways of coupling programs like garden hose – screw in another segment when it becomes necessary to massage data in another way. This is the way of IO also. ” M. D. McIlroy. October 11, 1964. ...|$|R

The switch design is modular to accommodate different service types, and the architecture features a high-speed optical ring operating at 1 Gbit/s to route input (up-link) channels to output (down-link) channels. The switch is inherently a packet switch, but can process either circuit-switched or packet-switched traffic.
