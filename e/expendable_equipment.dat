5000|$|Standard Clones: The UA has countless clones, and for {{the most}} part, they are treated like <b>expendable</b> <b>equipment.</b> They wear combat armor, and are {{generally}} referred to as bubbleheads because of the shape of their helmets. They are all cut from the same helix and are unquestionably loyal, responding to orders before thinking about them. They are designed to think that they are not clones, and a gland in their bodies releases a deadly toxin into their blood, killing them instantly, if they ever accept that they are clones. This has been called the death reflex.|$|E
40|$|Exploration {{geophysics}} {{has been}} largely a free-enterprise venture and new developments have been "sold " through ad-vertisements in the journal GEOPHYSICS. Thus, a review of advertisements provides an eclectic history of geophysics. The following is the view obtained from advertisements alone. The dates cited are usually when ads for innovations first appeared. New features often had been applied earlier, before they were advertised. THE EARLY YEARS: 1936 - 1945 Big advertisers {{in the early days}} were mainly suppliers of <b>expendables</b> and <b>equipment.</b> I 1 Iustrations in volume 1 of GEO-PHYSICS, then published by the Society of Petroleum Geo-physicists, included a Ford truck (Figure 1) that could be driven "through hub-deep mud, swamps, rice fields, or over the roughest rock-covered hills; " an Askania magnetometer (Figure 2) to "reduce the cost of checking an area with other geophysical instruments by eliminating uninteresting areas;" and a Monroe calculator (Figure 3) with which geophysicists spent many hours cranking out their calculations by hand. There were no advertisements in the first issue of volume 1, but the second, the June 1936 issue, had 27 pages of ads, including a one-page Professional Directory (Figure 4) con-taining a total of six ads and an ad promoting Seismograph Service Corporaticn's 594 months of experience and their six-channel recording system (Figure 5).

40|$|A {{description}} is given of life support subsystem concepts for advanced extravehicular protective systems (AEPS) {{intended for use}} on future orbital, lunar surface, and Mars surface missions in the late 1970 's and 1980 's. Primary interest was centered around the thermal control and carbon dioxide control subsystems because they offer the greatest potential for total weight savings. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} generation of regenerable subsystem concepts; however, partially regenerable and expendable concepts were also considered. Previously conceived and developed subsystem concepts were included in the study. Concepts were evaluated on the basis of subsystem weight and volume, and subsystem contribution to parent vehicle weight and volume, which included spares, regeneration <b>equipment,</b> <b>expendables,</b> expandables storage penalty, power penalty, and process heating or cooling penalty. Results are presented showing total weight and volume penalty as a function of total mission extravehicular activity (EVA) hours, and showing EVA weight and volume as a function of EVA duration. Subsystem concepts are recommended for each life support function, and secondary concepts which should be developed are also identified...|$|R
40|$|ITC/USA 2012 Conference Proceedings / The Forty-Eighth Annual International Telemetering Conference and Technical Exhibition / October 22 - 25, 2012 / Town and Country Resort & Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaMeasuring and {{confirming}} equipment {{usable life}} that passes dynamic environmental factory acceptance testing (ATP) will ensure no equipment will fail prematurely increasing safety and mission assurance on the Air Force's Next Generation Reusable Space Booster (NGRSB). The same analog telemetry generated and analyzed during ATP {{used to measure}} and confirm equipment performance per the procurement contract can serve both purposes. Since the NGRSB payload lift requirement {{is the same as}} the EELV, the need for exotic combinations of reusable and throwaway components is unnecessary unless they yield new level of reliability, maintainability and supportability. A prognostics and health management (PHM) program exploits the presence of non-repeatable transient events (NRTE) (a. k. a. accelerated aging) that is missed during any engineering analysis in equipment analog telemetry to calculate equipment remaining usable life/mission life. Without an invasive physical measurement of equipment usable life, satellite and launch vehicle equipment reliability is dominated by premature equipment failures. If the Air Force continues to calculate NGRSB equipment mission life on paper, the NGRSB equipment reliability will also be dominated by infant mortality failures just as all <b>expendable</b> launch vehicle <b>equipment</b> is. The Air Force's, Markov-based reliability paradigm used to procure Air Force satellites and launch vehicles, results in space mission infant mortality failure rate as high as 25 %/year. According to the Aerospace Corporation, Air Force space vehicle equipment that passes both equipment level and vehicle level ATP has a 70 % likelihood of failing prematurely within 45 days after arriving in space. If a PHM is used on the NGRSB, it stops premature failures and lowers life overall cycle cost providing superior reliability, maintainability, supportability and availability for future Air Force space missions that are too important and too expensive to fail prematurely...|$|R

50|$|The need {{to measure}} ocean {{properties}} in the shortest possible time with <b>expendable</b> <b>equipment</b> {{led to the development}} of the Shallow-Water Expendable Environmental Profiler (SWEEP). SWEEP, which could operate in waters up to 100 meters deep, was moored to the bottom and at pre-programmed intervals would surface to transmit physical data collected on the bottom and while traveling to and from the surface. However, SWEEP was not usable in areas with trawler fishing activities. SACLANTCEN merged the features of Barny and SWEEP and developed the Shallow-water Environmental Profiler Trawl-safe Real-time (SEPTR), a buoy similar to Barny but with a profiler similar to the one used on SWEEP, which would surface at fixed intervals. Tested in 2000, SEPTR was available for use in the ASCOT01 sea trial and updated versions are still in operation today.|$|E
