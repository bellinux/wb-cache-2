25|$|Cunningham's novel {{also uses}} the device in Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway of placing {{the action of}} the novel within the space of one day. In Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway it is one <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the central {{character}} Clarissa Dalloway. In Cunningham's book it is one <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> each of the three central characters; Clarissa Vaughan, Laura Brown and Virginia Woolf herself. Through this prism, Cunningham attempts, as did Woolf, to show the beauty and profundity of every dayeven the most ordinaryin every person's life and conversely how a person's whole life can be examined through the prism of one single day.|$|E

25|$|Created by R. A.

25|$|Although the {{original}} play contained three parts, they ran simultaneously {{so that the}} audience would experience a <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Little, Chiron and Black concurrently.

The first full-length book to be distributed as samizdat was Boris Pasternak's 1957 novel Doctor Zhivago. Although the literary magazine Novy Mir had published ten poems from the book in 1954, a year later the full text was judged unsuitable for publication and entered samizdat circulation. The novel One <b>Day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Life</b> <b>of</b> Ivan Denisovich by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had a similar fate and was widely distributed via samizdat.|$|E
25|$|Tarkovsky {{has been}} the subject of several documentaries. Most notable is the 1988 {{documentary}} Moscow Elegy, by Russian film director Alexander Sokurov.

25|$|The strip {{developed}} {{a series of}} formulas that ran over its course to facilitate {{a wide range of}} stories. The earlier strips relied on a formula by which Daddy Warbucks is called away on business and through a variety of contrivances, Annie is cast out of the Warbucks mansion, usually by her enemy, the nasty Mrs. Warbucks. Annie then wanders the countryside and has adventures meeting and helping new people in their daily struggles. Early stories dealt with political corruption, criminal gangs and corrupt institutions, which Annie would confront. Annie ultimately would encounter troubles with the villain, who would be vanquished by the returning Daddy Warbucks. Annie and Daddy would then be reunited, at which point, after several weeks, the formula would play out again. In the series, each strip represented a single <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the characters. This device was dropped {{by the end of the}} '20s.|$|E
