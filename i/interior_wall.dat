25|$|Copper aesthetically enhances <b>interior</b> <b>wall</b> systems, ceilings, fixtures, furniture, and {{hardware}} by evoking {{an atmosphere of}} warmth, tranquility, and calm. Regarding performance advantages, it is lightweight, fire resistant, durable, workable, and non-organic (it does not off-gas). Typical copper-based interiors include panels, shingles, screens, ornaments, fixtures, and other decorative enhancements.|$|E
25|$|The {{house is}} first {{mentioned}} (as Broke House) in {{the reign of}} Elizabeth I in a grant dated 1589, but this was an earlier building, though some parts of it are incorporated in the present house. Arthur Oswald thought that the <b>interior</b> <b>wall</b> parallel to the front outside wall and fireplaces {{in two of the}} bedrooms may come from the Elizabethan house. The house was substantially enlarged and rebuilt in the mid-17th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{addition}} to the height {{can be seen on}} the <b>interior</b> <b>wall.</b> The east window is of uncertain date and has been modernised. There are two windows in the south wall. The eastern one is 14th-century with two trefoil lights and is square-headed, with modern glass. The sill is a stone slab with a moulded edge, probably from a tomb or altar. The other window is one, wide pointed, 13th-century light (probably a lancet window reduced) with modern glass showing St Laurence with gridiron.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks {{can be part of}} the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the <b>interior</b> <b>wall</b> plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.|$|E
25|$|The Moorish and Gothic Victorian {{influence}} is manifested immediately for its rectangular plan with towers at its front corners; its decorative composite curved moldings which follows the contour {{of the roof}} overhang throughout the entire structure; its colorful paint application (the building is painted in horizontal bands following the exterior cladding alternating Ponce's official colors, red and black; the interior is also painted very colorful, alternating vertical bands of red and orange that decorates the walls and a painted frieze with fireman's motif culminates the <b>interior</b> <b>wall</b> decoration); {{and the use of}} long and narrow windows with fans at its top; among other details typifies a Moorish style.|$|E

25|$|Of course, many conjectural {{decisions}} were made, {{such as the}} precise locations of the exterior doors and the size and locations of the windows. On the interior, {{the location of the}} staircase to the loft and the form of the large open hearths and built-in bed box also involved conjecture, but were based on historical precedent. In the original Brooklyn Museum installation, there were two bed boxes on the exterior wall of the north room. When the house was moved to its present location in 2006, it was decided that if the house did have a bed box it more logically was on an <b>interior</b> <b>wall</b> next to the hearth as you now will see it.|$|E
25|$|During the shooting, many {{of those}} in {{attendance}} managed to escape the room and flee deeper into the building, while those who remained hid underneath tables or in bathrooms, closets, and cupboards. A bullet hit a fire sprinkler pipe, causing water to pour down the banquet room, {{making it difficult to}} see. The perpetrators moved between tables, shooting anyone who moved or made a sound. One person was struck by a bullet that tore through an <b>interior</b> <b>wall,</b> while another was shot while trying to escape through a glass door near where the shooters had entered. Three men attempted to stop one of the shooters, but all were shot; it was unclear if any of them survived. One victim was killed while shielding a coworker with his body. Some initially mistook the attack as an active shooter drill; some previous such drills had taken place in the same banquet room.|$|E
25|$|As of April–May 2014 a major re-ordering is planned, so as {{to adapt}} the {{building}} for dual use as a church and a hall for hire to raise funds. This means that Barber's original pews are to be sold, and a new position must be found for the font. The planning application states that two windows will be removed {{on the south side}} of the nave, the sills will be dismantled, and the openings are to be retained for a kitchen serving hatch and an entry point for the extension. It is not known whether the toilet and kitchen, necessarily visible from the road, will be of sympathetic design. Barber's original polished deal floor, which still exists, may be replaced with other flooring. The church is expected therefore to lose its present completeness of original structure and furnishing by a major local architect. Because the new extension will necessitate re-plastering the western half of the south wall, any remaining original <b>interior</b> <b>wall</b> paintings still hidden under paint will be lost. Planning application no.13/00146/FUL for the extension was submitted on 18 January 2013 and has been granted. When the application was submitted, the Church Architect did not know of the building's date, its architect or its history.|$|E

500|$|States, cities, foreign countries, benevolent societies, other organizations, and {{individuals}} have contributed 194 memorial stones, all {{inserted into the}} east and west interior walls above stair landings or levels for easy viewing, except one on the south <b>interior</b> <b>wall</b> between stairs that is difficult to view. The sources disagree on the number of stones for two reasons: whether one or both [...] "height stones" [...] are included, and stones not yet on display at the time of a source's publication cannot be included. The [...] "height stones" [...] refer to two stones that indicate height: during the first phase of construction a stone with an inscription that includes the phrase [...] "from the foundation to this height 100 feet" [...] was installed just below the 80–90-foot stairway and high above the 60–70-foot stairway; during the second phase of construction a stone with a horizontal line and the phrase [...] "top of statue on Capitol" [...] was installed on the 330-foot level.|$|E

Between the canopy posts are fuel islands designed to hold three fuel pumps each. 1960s-vintage pumps are situated on the islands, with three on the western canopy and two on the southern. A chamfered corner separates the two canopies. Multiple-pane windows surround the glass doors of the office station, as well as dominating much of the southern side of the building. Situated between the office and the café are two service station bays with roll-up style overhead doors.|$|E
