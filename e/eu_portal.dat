It is the 30 th most populous municipality in the European Union and contains three UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The Seville harbour, located about 80 km from the Atlantic Ocean, is the only river port in Spain. The city {{is located on the}} plain of the Guadalquivir River. Using Multi-Temporal InSAR with ERS- 1 / 2 and Envisat data a subsidence behavior is detected in the period 1992 - 2010. The geometry of the subsiding areas suggests that it should be conditioned by the fluvial dynamics of the Guadalquivir River and its tributaries. Facies distribution along the fluvial system (paleochannels, flood plains.), with different grain size and matrix proportion, may explain the relative subsidence between the different sectors.

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} {{the ways in which}} EU {{institutional}} discourses of mental health care are recontextualized for the purpose of disseminating specialized knowledge. It specifically investigates whether language barriers occur in specialized discourse, assuming that comprehensibility and simplification are key factors for effective communication with the lay audience. The investigation is carried out on the grounds of a quantitative-qualitative analysis of different text types collected from the Health <b>EU</b> <b>Portal,</b> and adopting a concordance-based discourse analytical approach. Findings reveal how texts are mostly targeted to professional audiences, marginalizing citizens and patients through the use of inaccessible language which hinders effec-tive communication with the general public. The investigation reveals a noticeable difference among the texts in the EU corpus. In general, specialized discourse was found to be featured by legal language, notably known for its obscurity and ambiguity, thus resulting unintelligible to non-experts as no discursive strategies of support were identified. Processes of recontextualisation were implemented when other professionals (e. g. doctors, managers and hospital staff) were the direct recipients. In these cases, discourse was recontextualised to facilitate professional understanding by moving from specialised legal language to technical registers appropriately. The analysis of the online information booklet programme 2008 - 2013 shows a move towards the marketisation of the institutional discourse of mental health care. It is centred on self-promotional discourse as a counterpart of specialised discourse. Thus, its goal is to disseminate self-promoting content, rather than effectively cater for common people or patients, despite the occasional use of a less formal and simplified register...|$|E

40|$|Open {{government}} {{data are}} considered a key asset for eGovernment. One could argue that governments can influence other types of data disclosure, as potential ingredients of innovative services. To discuss this assumption, we took {{the example of the}} U. S. 'Green Button' initiative - based on the disclosure of energy consumption data to each user - and analysed 36 energy-oriented digital services reusing these and other data, in order to highlight their set of inputs. We find that apps suggesting to a user a more efficient consumption behaviour also benefit from average retail electricity cost/price information; that energy efficiency 'scoring' apps also need, at least, structured and updated information on buildings performance; and that value-added services that derive insights from consumption data frequently rely on average energy consumption information. More in general, most of the surveyed services combine consumption data, open government data, and corporate data. When setting sector-specific agendas grounded on data disclosure, public agencies should therefore consider (contributing) to make available all three layers of information. No widely acknowledged initiatives of energy consumption data disclosure to users are being implemented in the EU. Moreover, browsing <b>EU</b> data <b>portals</b> and websites of public agencies, we find that other key data ingredients are not supplied (or, at least, not as open data), leaving room for possible improvements in this aren...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Financial Transparency System (FTS) of the European Commission {{contains}} {{information about}} grants for Euro-pean Union projects starting from 2007.

40|$|Background: Previous {{analyses}} concerning health {{components of}} European Union (EU) -funded research have shown low project participation {{levels of the}} 12 newest member states (EU- 12). Additionally, {{there has been a}} lack of subject-area analysis. In the Health Research for Europe project, we screened all projects of the EU's Framework Programmes for research FP 5 and FP 6 (1998 - 2006) to identify health research projects and describe participation by country and subject area. Methods: FP 5 and FP 6 project databases were acquired and screened by coders to identify health-related projects, which were then categorized according to the 47 divisions of the <b>EU</b> Health <b>Portal</b> (N = 2728 projects) plus an extra group of 'basic/biotech' projects (N = 1743). Country participation and coordination rates for projects were also analyzed. Results: Approximately 20 % of the 26 946 projects (value € 29. 2 bn) were health-related (N = 4756. Value € 6. 04 bn). Within the health categories, the largest expenditures were cancer (11. 9 %), 'other' (i. e. not mental health or cardiovascular) non-communicable diseases (9. 5 %) and food safety (9. 4 %). One hundred thirty-two countries participated in these projects. Of the 27 EU countries (and five partner countries), north-western and Nordic states acquired more projects per capita. The UK led coordination with > 20 % of projects. EU- 12 countries were generally under-represented for participation and coordination. Conclusions: Combining our findings with the associated literature, we comment on drivers determining distribution of participation and funds across countries and subject areas. Additionally, we discuss changes needed in the core EU projects database to provide greater transparency, data exploitation and return on investment in health research...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of the}} “School of the Future” project (www. school-of-the-future. eu [1]), which {{receives}} funding {{within the}} EU's 7 th Framework Programme, is to design, demonstrate, evaluate and communicate shining examples of how to reach the future high- performance building level. School buildings and their primary users, namely pupils - the next generation - are in {{the focus of the}} project. Both, the energy and indoor environment performance of 4 demonstration buildings in 4 European countries and climates are being greatly improved due to holistic retrofit of the building envelope, the service systems, the integration of renewables and building management systems. The results and the accompanying research and dissemination efforts to support other actors dealing with building retrofits are leading to a multiplied impact on other schools and on the residential sector, since the pupils will act as communicators to their families. The user behaviour and the awareness of energy efficiency and indoor environment are being improved due to tailored training sessions. Nearly zero emission or nearly zero energy buildings are main goals in various country roadmaps for 2020. The demonstration buildings of this project may not completely reach this level, though, as the aim of the FP 7 call is cost efficiency and multiplication potential. The retrofit concepts, however, result in buildings with far lower energy consumption than achieved by regular retrofits and focus on high indoor environment quality - thus leading the way towards zero emission. They can be considered as schools of the future. Results from national examples of zero emission schools complete the information used for developing the deliverables such as guidelines, information tools, publications and a community at the <b>EU</b> BUILD UP <b>portal.</b> The project is based on a close connection between demonstration, research and industry which is being represented by the “Design Advice and Evaluation Group”. This group of research and industry partners meets twice at every demonstration building site in order to give advice to the local planning group like informing them about suitable up-to-date technologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} open data {{available}} for hydrology research is continually growing and provides opportunities for new science and products. Although the existing digital infrastructures (GEOSS Portal, INSPIRE community geoportal and other initiatives) {{provide access to}} open data, many hydrologists still encounter difficulties in finding and using open data. Since the time spent on collecting and preparing data usually amounts to more than the time spent on an experiment, any improvement on finding, understanding, accessing and using open data is greatly beneficial. The Spatial Information Platform (SIP) has been developed to tackle these issues within the SWITCH-ON European funded FP 7 project. The SIP has been designed as a toolbox of interconnected software components based on open standards that provide to the user all the necessary functionalities {{as described in the}} Publish-Find-Bind (PFB) pattern. In other words, this means that the SIP enables users to locate relevant and suitable data for the task they are carrying out and to access and transform it (filtering, extraction, selection, conversion, aggregation). Moreover, the SIP can be used to provide descriptive information about the data and to publish it so others can find it and use it. The SIP is based on existing open data protocols such as OGC-CSW, OGC-WMS, OpenDAP and open-source technologies such as PostgreSQL/PostGIS, GeoServer and pyCSW among others. The SIP is divided in three main user interfaces: the BYOD (Browse your open dataset) web interface, the Expert GUI tool and the Upload Data and Metadata web interface. The BYOD (Browse Your Own Data) HTML 5 client is the main entry point for end users that want to search and browse open data in the SIP. The BYOD has a map interface based on Leaflet JavaScript libraries so that the users can search more efficiently. The Expert GUI is an integrated desktop application which can be run by verified experts and members of the SWITCH-ON project only and provides full metadata editing capabilities. The web-based Open Data Registration Tool is designed to provide a user-friendly upload and metadata description interface the end users community. In conclusion, the Spatial Information Platform (SIP) provides to the hydrological science community a set of tools for better understanding and ease of use of hydrological open-data. Moreover, the SIP has been based on well-known OGC standards that will allow the connection and data harvesting from popular <b>EU</b> open data <b>portals</b> such as the GEOSS system of systems...|$|R
40|$|INSPIRE is a European Directive {{aiming to}} {{establish}} a EU-wide spatial data infrastructure to give cross-border access to {{information that can be}} used to support EU environmental policies, as well as other policies and activities having an impact on the environment. In order to ensure cross-border interoperability of data infrastructures operated by EU Member States, INSPIRE sets out a framework based on common specifications for metadata, data, network services, data and service sharing, monitoring and reporting. The implementation of INSPIRE has reached important milestones: the INSPIRE Geoportal was launched in 2011 providing a single access point for the discovery of INSPIRE data and services across EU Member States (currently, about 300 K), while all the technical specifications for the interoperability of data across the 34 INSPIRE themes were adopted at the end of 2013. During this period a number of EU and international initiatives has been launched, concerning cross-domain interoperability and (Linked) Open Data. In particular, the <b>EU</b> Open Data <b>Portal,</b> launched in December 2012, made provisions to access government and scientific data from EU institutions and bodies, and the EU ISA Programme (Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations) promotes cross-sector interoperability by sharing and re-using EU-wide and national standards and components. Moreover, the Research Data Alliance (RDA), an initiative jointly funded by the European Commission, the US National Science Foundation and the Australian Research Council, was launched in March 2013 to promote scientific data sharing and interoperability. The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC), besides being the technical coordinator of the implementation of INSPIRE, is also actively involved in the initiatives promoting cross-sector re-use in INSPIRE, and sustainable approaches to address the evolution of technologies - in particular, how to support Linked Data in INSPIRE and the use of global persistent identifiers. It is evident that government and scientific data infrastructures are currently facing a number of issues that have already been addressed in INSPIRE. Sharing experiences and competencies will avoid re-inventing the wheel, and help promoting the cross-domain adoption of consistent solutions. Actually, one of the lessons learnt from INSPIRE and the initiatives in which JRC is involved, is that government and research data are not two separate worlds. Government data are commonly used as a basis to create scientific data, and vice-versa. Consequently, it is fundamental to adopt a consistent approach to address interoperability and data management issues shared by both government and scientific data. The presentation illustrates some of the lessons learnt during the implementation of INSPIRE and in work on data and service interoperability coordinated with European and international initiatives. We describe a number of critical interoperability issues and barriers affecting both scientific and government data, concerning, e. g., data terminologies, quality and licensing, and propose how these problems could be effectively addressed by a closer collaboration of the government and scientific communities, and the sharing of experiences and practices.
