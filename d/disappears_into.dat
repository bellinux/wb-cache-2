5|$|After {{collecting}} {{all four}} artefacts, Lara travels to Antarctica and discovers that Dr. Willard {{had been using}} the knowledge gained from the meteorite to perform experiments on his own men, turning them into horrible mutations. Angered by this revelation, she confronts Dr. Willard, who reveals that he is planning to encourage the mutations, only on a global scale, using the combined power of the artefacts and the meteorite from which they were carved. As Lara voices her opposition to his operation, Willard betrays her, steals the artefacts, and <b>disappears</b> <b>into</b> the excavation site. After fighting more mutants and navigating the treacherous ruins of the ancient city built atop the meteorite crater, Lara faces Willard, who has now used {{the power of the}} four artefacts to greatly speed up the evolutionary processes of the human body and thereby turned himself into a spider-like creature.

5|$|At {{the center}} of the massive ship, V'Ger is {{revealed}} to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned, and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, it finds its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator, Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that <b>disappears</b> <b>into</b> another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions.|$|E
5|$|Owens did {{not have}} time to {{complete}} the shot before the Cannes screenings, but afterwards he used cineSync to conduct most of the work from home. The shot includes two blocks of computer-generated buildings that recede into the distance of a downtown set extension. As Collins <b>disappears</b> <b>into</b> the crowd about a minute into the shot, the live footage is gradually joined with more digital work. The streetcars, tracks and power lines were all computer generated. Live-action extras appear for the first minute of the shot before being replaced by digital ones. The shot was made more complicated by the need to add Massive extras. Owens constructed the scene by first building the digital foreground around the live action footage. He then added the background before filling the scene with vehicles and people.|$|E

5|$|Quatermass and Briscoe {{determine}} {{from the}} evidence at hand that something living in outer space has entered the ship, dissolved Reichenheim and Green in their sealed spacesuits, and evidently entered Carroon's body, which {{is now in the}} process of being changed by this unknown entity. Not knowing any of this, Carroon's wife, Judith, hires a private investigator, Christie, to break her husband out of the secured hospital. The escape is successful, but not before Carroon smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room, fuses it into his flesh, then kills the private investigator and absorbs all the forces of life in his body, leaving just a shrivelled husk. It does not take long for Judith to discover what is happening to her husband; Carroon flees and <b>disappears</b> <b>into</b> the London night, leaving her screaming outside the hospital, alive, unharmed, but entirely mad from fright.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, {{collecting}} four slates that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores. Once all four slates are collected, Esher requests that the player bring the tablet {{to him in the}} now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out. If Esher is given the tablet, he will explain he wishes to use the tablet for domination, and will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives the tablet to Yeesha, the tablet simply slips through her hands and <b>disappears</b> <b>into</b> the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the tablet, ending their enslavement. Arriving at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D'ni people; Esher is handed over to the Bahro to be punished for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.|$|E
5|$|That night, as Jack and Kate {{decide to}} search for the plane cockpit as its {{transceiver}} would allow the survivors to send a distress signal, loud roaring noises and crashing trees are heard in the nearby jungle. The following morning, the two are accompanied by Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) on their way into the jungle. The cockpit is found leaning against a tree, forcing the trio to climb it to reach the cabin. Charlie <b>disappears</b> <b>into</b> the bathroom while Jack and Kate awaken the concussed pilot (Greg Grunberg) in the cabin. The pilot tells them that the plane had lost radio contact six hours after take off, where it turned back for Fiji and hit wake turbulence. After estimating that the flight was 1,000 miles off course before it crashed, the pilot tries using the transceiver, but cannot get a signal. Suddenly the strange roaring noises heard on the beach the previous night return, and when the pilot investigates, he is seized by something outside and blood splatters on the window, prompting the trio to grab the transceiver and flee. During the escape, Charlie falls and Jack returns to help him, while a terrified Kate runs on. After the monster disappears, Kate, Charlie and Jack reunite and find the pilot's bloodied corpse suspended in a treetop.|$|E

5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her hands into the body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then <b>disappears</b> <b>into</b> the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, a {{masquerade}} party ensues in {{the opera}} house. At the party, Christine wears her new engagement ring from Raoul. The event is interrupted once {{again by the}} Phantom, who is dressed as Red Death. The Phantom brings his own composition, Don Juan Triumphant, and orders the managers to stage the opera. Raoul exits the room and Christine approaches the Phantom. At {{the sight of the}} engagement ring, the Phantom rips it from Christine and <b>disappears</b> <b>into</b> a trap on the floor. Raoul tries to follow him but is stopped by Madame Giry, who privately tells him the story of the Phantom's past. When she was a little girl, she went to a freak circus where they featured a deformed child in a cage. The child was beaten while everyone watched and laughed. The ringmaster then removed a burlap sack covering the child's face, revealing his deformity. Only the young Madame Giry pitied him. She was the last to leave and saw the child strangle the ringmaster with a rope. Chased by the police, Madame Giry helped him escape and found shelter for him beneath the opera house, where she has hidden him from the world ever since.|$|E
