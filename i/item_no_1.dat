40|$|Estimating {{project scope}} is {{considered}} by many to be the most difficult part of software estimation. Parametric models have been shown to give accurate estimates of cost and duration given accurate inputs of the project scope, but how do you input scope early in the life cycle when the requirements are still vaguely understood? How can scope be estimated, quantified, and documented in a manner that is understandable to management, end users, and estimating tools? This article focuses on scope estimates for maintenance and reuse work, including bug fixes (corrective maintenance); modifications to support changes in the operating system, database management system, compiler, or other aspect of the operating environment (adaptive maintenance); and modifications of existing functionality to improve that functionality (perfective maintenance). Reuse includes any case where you are modifying an existing code base to support enhanced functionality, and includes cases where an existing application is translated to a new language. The effort estimates cover code fixes and enhancements, regression and other testing of those fixes, updates to documentation, and management of those efforts. It does not include requirement/usability efforts or deployment efforts. At a high level, maintenance projects consist of three types of work: 1. Maintaining an existing, functioning application. 2. Modifying existing code to support changing requirements. 3. Adding new functionality to an existing application. A team doing a new build for an existing application would only be concerned with item Nos. 2 and 3. A team keeping an existing code base functioning would only do <b>item</b> <b>No.</b> <b>1,</b> and possibly item No. 2 depending on how new builds are handled. A project manager may be responsible for both areas and might need to estimate the effort required for all three. This article will deal with each individually. Maintaining Existing Code Maintenance as we are defining it consists of three types of activities [1]: • Corrective Maintenance. Fixing bugs in the code and documentation. Bugs are areas where the code does not operate in accordance with the requirements used when it was built. • Adaptive Maintenance. Modifying the application to continue functioning after installation of an upgrade to the underlying virtual machine (database management system, operating system, etc.) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Item {{analysis}} {{is an effective}} method {{in the evaluation of}} multiple‑choice achievement tests. This study aimed to compare the classical and the latent class models used in item analysis, as well as their efficacy in the evaluation of the examinations of the medical faculty. Materials and Methods: The achievement tests in the medical faculty were evaluated using different methods. The two methods used were the classical and the latent class models. Among the classical methods, Cronbach’s alpha, split half methods, item discrimination, and item difficulty was investigated. On the other hand, various models of item response theory (IRT) and their statistics were compared in the group of latent class methods. Results: Reliability statistics had values above 0. 87. <b>Item</b> <b>no.</b> 7 was found easy, <b>item</b> <b>no.</b> 45 difficult and <b>item</b> <b>no.</b> 64 fairly difficult according to the evaluations done by classical and item response theories. In terms of <b>item</b> discrimination, <b>item</b> <b>no.</b> 45 had lower, <b>item</b> <b>no.</b> 7 had middle and <b>item</b> <b>no.</b> 64 had high discrimination levels. The distribution graph shows that personal abilities are good enough to tick the correct choice. Conclusion: In this study, similar results were obtained by classical and latent methods. IRT can be considered perfect at a mathematical level, and if its assumptions are satisfied, it can easily perform assessments and measurements for most types of complex problems. Classical theory is easy to understand and to apply, while IRT is, on the contrary, sometimes rather difficult to understand and to implement...|$|R
