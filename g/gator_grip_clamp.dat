5000|$|Unlike Poma's grips, Doppelmayr grips are double {{position}} grips. When {{the chair}} enters a terminal, the angled roller is pushed {{down by a}} metal strip, which opens a grip jaw. The jaw remains open until the chair reattaches to the cable upon departing the terminal. <b>Grip</b> <b>clamping</b> force is measured {{just prior to the}} double position grips reattaching to the haul rope while a carrier (chair) is exiting the terminal, in contrast to Poma's grips, in which grip force can be measured as the grip travels through the contour. Insufficient grip force triggers an alarm and brings the lift to a halt before the carrier reaches the first breakover tower after the terminal. Because of this design, most Doppelmayr detachable lifts are designed to allow operation in reverse. This allows a grip force-alarmed grip and carrier to be backed into the terminal for inspection or removal.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to improve {{characterization}} of hyperelastic materials in biaxial tension through improved design and validation of an existing test fixture and specimen geometry. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the material properties to variations in selected test parameters was conducted to better understand material response. Misalignment and binding in the original tensile test fixture resulted in non-equibiaxial loading and inaccurate stress-strain data. Analysis and modification were required to improve accuracy and repeatability. Vector analysis of the link system and the Minimum Constraint Design method were used to achieve this aim. Based on a proposed set of criteria, a FE analysis was conducted on several biaxial specimen geometries to determine the best shape and scale for obtaining stress and strain data. A stress decay factor (SDF) is proposed to predict internal stresses from measurable data. A test method has been designed around the use of the SDF and was ultimately applied to a cruciform specimen geometry. In addition to the ideal equibiaxial case, numerical simulations have been perturbed in two ways. The first variation involved a specimen <b>gripped</b> <b>clamps</b> offset by up to half the width of the clamp. The second variation involved non-equibiaxial load ratios ranging from 0. 85 to 1. 15. The goal was to quantify the change in stress-strain response to slight deviations from ideal loading conditions. Binding has been eliminated from the test fixture and a 1 : 1 load ratio has been achieved. The new specimen experiences less stress decay while achieving greater experimental strain. A high sensitivity to non-equibiaxial load ratios and low sensitivity to clamp offset are seen in the test parameter analysis. Finally, results from the SDF correction material characterization method is compared with results from an inflated boiling flask geometry...|$|R

40|$|Background: The new robotic Endowrist {{surgical}} staplers {{and the new}} Integrated Table Motion (ITM) for the Da Vinci Xi are new {{devices that}} allows to control directly from the console all steps of mechanical surgical suture and patient’re-positioning without undocking the robot and with instruments inside the abdomen. We present a case of robot assisted right colectomy and cholecystectomy with the Da Vinci Xi®and this new devices. Materials and Methods: An 81 -years old woman with an adenocarcinoma of the right colon and gallstones was referred to our center. She was operated on with Da Vinci Xi platform with right quadrant trocar’disposition. Results: The procedure was successfully completed in 270 min. The patient position changed one time during the intervention with instruments left inside the abdomen and without undocking the robot. Both the resection of the transverse colon and of the last ileal loop, together with the ileocolic anastomoses were realized {{through the use of}} robotics linear stapler. The enterotomies were closed with a double layer of continuous sutures. Firstly the patient was arranged 15 ° tilted to the left and in Trendelemburg position for right colectomy. Then for the right colic flexure and ileo-colic anastomosis, the inclination was reduced. No external collision or other problems related to the operating bed was noted. There were no surgical complications or a need for conversion to laparoscopy or laparotomy. The patient had an uneventful recovery and she was discharged from hospital after 4 days. Conclusions:The linear robotic stapler could give some advantages allowing the operator directly control all the steps of the suture: "positioning, <b>grip,</b> <b>clamp</b> and fire". It also allows the full articulation of the stapler with a range of 108 ° and reduces the possibility of error related to the thickness of the tissue within the jaws of the stapler noting the suitable thickness.

40|$|The elastic {{behavior}} of arteries is nonlinear when subjected to large deformations. In order to measure their anisotropic behavior, planar biaxial tests are often used.

In this study, we demonstrate the use of inverse modeling to fit the material properties by taking into account the non-uniform stress distribution, and discuss the differences between the three types of tests. Square and cruciform samples were dissected from pig aortas and tested equi-biaxially. Rectangular samples were used in uniaxial testing as well. On the square samples, forces were applied on each side of edge sample attached with hooks, and strains were measured in the center using optical tracking of ink dots. On the cruciform and rectangular samples, displacements were applied on <b>grip</b> <b>clamps</b> and forces were measured on the clamps. Each type of experiment was simulated with the finite element method. The parameters of the Mooney-Rivlin constitutive model were adjusted with an optimization algorithm so that the simulation predictions fitted the experimental results. Higher stretch ratios (> 1. 5) were reached in the cruciform and rectangular samples than in the square samples before failure. Therefore, the nonlinear behavior of the tissue in large deformations was better captured by the cruciform biaxial test and the uniaxial test, than by the square biaxial test.

40|$|Most {{studies on}} the {{adhesive}} mechanisms of climbing animals have addressed attachment against flat surfaces, yet many animals can climb highly curved surfaces, like twigs and small branches. Here we investigated whether tree frogs use a <b>clamping</b> <b>grip</b> by recording the ground reaction forces on a cylindrical object with either a smooth or anti-adhesive, rough surface. Furthermore, we measured the contact area of fore and hindlimbs against differently sized transparent cylinders and the forces of individual pads and subarticular tubercles in restrained animals. Our study revealed that frogs use friction and normal forces of roughly a similar magnitude for holding on to cylindrical objects. When challenged with climbing a non-adhesive surface, the compressive forces between opposite legs nearly doubled, indicating a stronger <b>clamping</b> <b>grip.</b> In contrast to climbing flat surfaces, frogs increased the contact area on all limbs by engaging not just adhesive pads but also subarticular tubercles on curved surfaces. Our force measurements showed that tubercles can withstand larger shear stresses than pads. SEM images of tubercles revealed a similar structure to that of toe pads including the presence of nanopillars, though channels surrounding epithelial cells were less pronounced. The tubercles' smaller size, proximal location on the toes and shallow cells make them probably less prone to buckling and thus ideal for gripping curved surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Identifying {{material}} characteristics of composites {{is important in}} designing any structural system. The aerospace industry relies on these material properties not only to design a functional aircraft, but also a safe and reliable one. Since carbon fiber composites are relatively new materials, {{little is known about}} its characteristics under certain loading conditions. The majority of previous research has been dedicated to inplane tension, bending, and shear loading. However, little to no research has been devoted to out-of-plane shear loading (Mode III) of notched panels. This document presents a novel approach to test and analyze panels loaded in Mode III. Literature provided some excellent inspiration for designing a feasible testing method. The proposed method consists of a testing fixture, as well as a testing procedure. One component of the testing fixture includes a hinged grip mechanism to apply load to the panel. The <b>grips</b> are <b>clamped</b> {{on each side of the}} notch and then loaded in opposite directions. The hinge gives the system a rotational degree of freedom and helps eliminate any unwanted damage near the grips. This creates high stress concentrations at the notch tip. To validate this testing method, six different ply layups were analyzed. Each ply layup was tested using six repeated specimens to show consistency between similar panels. The optical method, digital image correlation (DIC), provided a full-field strain measurement of the region of interest every two seconds throughout the test. Specific strain concentrations, secondary strain buildup, and early fracture patterns were extracted from the digital image correlation results. Along with strain patterns, applied load and grip displacement was recorded using the Bluehill® software.

For a specified pair of plug and plastic sheet, the variation in plug temperature can alter the coefficient of friction (COF) between the pair. We show here how the temperature dependence of COF influences {{the nature and extent}} of biaxial stretching of the sheet and consequently the thickness distribution of the thermoformed component. In the present study, high impact polystyrene (HIPS) sheets were thermoformed into axisymmetric cups using a plug-assist process in which the aluminum plug temperature (T-plug) was varied from ambient to above the glass transition temperature of HIPS (similar to 100 degrees C). Biaxial strain maps on the surfaces of the formed cups were measured and quantified using Grid Strain Analysis (GSA). Thickness distributions of the cups were also measured. Temperature dependent COF between HIPS and aluminum was determined independently using a rotational rheometer. The measured COF was low for T 100 degrees C, a significant reduction in the magnitude of slip is expected. Here the sheet is <b>gripped</b> at the <b>clamp</b> and by the plug during forming which causes reduced biaxial stretching of the base and increased uniaxial stretching of the walls of the cup.

Commonly it is designed as a mechanical hand by using the mechanical force in the automation system. It only can manipulate to the similar object, size and shape, because sequence motion is already compiled by a programmer. This makes user hard to manipulate and only can control the gripper manually. Thus to make the gripper can do the work in different conditions, the sensor and control systems are required for development automated gripper.
