40|$|We {{consider}} {{the performance of}} TCP/IP traffic over a LAN <b>interconnection</b> <b>service</b> (such as SMDS) based on ATM. In order to achieve a reasonable utilisation of the ATM network {{and at the same}} time guarantee the packet loss probability specified by SMDS, a shaping buffer is necessary in the MAN to WAN interworking unit. Through simulation studies we show that good TCP performance may be achieved with a shaper size of around 1000 cells. However, the load conditions that give optimal TCP performance do not necessarily coincide with those that satisfy the stringent loss requirements specified. Moreover, the shaping buffer introduces delay that is unacceptable for SMDS. The conclusion is that stringent delay and loss guarantees for the <b>interconnection</b> <b>service</b> are not appropriate for TCP traffic and can only be provided at the cost of low utilisation of the underlying ATM network. 1.

50|$|The {{predecessor}} of GR-IX, Athens Internet Exchange (AIX) {{was created}} by GRNET in 1997, to provide <b>interconnection</b> <b>services</b> between the Greek ISPs. By the late 1990s, the way AIX was set up was not completely satisfactory to the member ISPs: since AIX was located in Hellenic Telecommunications Organization (OTE) facilities, providers had to lease lines from OTE in order to connect to AIX. Additionally, ISPs {{had the right to}} charge other members for exchanged traffic, a right sometimes overused by the larger providers. To deal with these issues, GRNET decided in 2008 to create a new exchange, GR-IX. GR-IX went operational in 2009 and by January 2010 all AIX members had completed their move to GR-IX.|$|E

40|$|China {{does not}} comply with its WTO {{obligations}} except in principle and experiences the problem that the incumbent carrier may use technical and commercial mechanisms to maintain market dominance. This is possible because of weaknesses in the Chinese interconnection regulations and difficulties {{in the application of}} Chinese anti-competition law to interconnection. The thesis aims to provide a model for interconnection that may be used to deal with the present market dominance in the Chinese <b>interconnection</b> <b>service</b> market. In order to achieve this aim, the thesis identifies the weaknesses in the Chinese interconnection regulations which may be utilized by the incumbent carrier to impede fair competition in the <b>interconnection</b> <b>service</b> market by comparing the Chinese regulations, and the relevant regulations in the WTO Reference Paper and the relevant U. S. interconnection regulations. On the other hand, the thesis also assesses the application of Chinese anti-competition law to interconnection. Consequently the thesis consists of two main parts. Part I includes chapter two, three, four and five. This part focuses on identifying the disadvantages in the present interconnection principles in force in China, technical conditions of interconnection and interconnection charges, and sets out the remedies that will be useful in preventing the incumbent carrier from using technical and commercial mechanisms to maintain market dominance. Part II covers chapter six and seven. This part focuses on the application of Chinese anti-competition law to interconnection, and provides a way to fine-tune the possible disputes rose in interconnection from the perspective of Chinese Anti-monopoly Law.
