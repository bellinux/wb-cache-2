50|$|Generally, {{a diamond}} segment has a working layer and a {{transition}} layer. The working layer contains diamond grains for cutting or grinding, while the transition layer has no diamonds. It just consists of bond materials, {{and is used}} to connect the working layer {{to the body of}} the <b>diamond</b> <b>tool.</b> The transition layer is necessary for diamond segments used on laser-welded diamond tools. The compositions of the two layers should not be very different. Otherwise, the junction of them will tend to break because of the uneven heat and forces received by the two layers when the <b>diamond</b> <b>tool</b> is in use.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Silicon–aluminum alloys (Al-Si), with Si {{contents}} up to 12 % {{are important}} materials in automotive and aeronautical industries {{due to their}} low density and high wear resistance. The cutting force, surface roughness and <b>tool</b> wear of <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> and cemented carbides tool were compared when turning Al-Si alloy. The results indicated that there wasn't remarkable difference between <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> and cemented carbides tool in cutting force and surface roughness when rough turning silicon-aluminum alloy. While in finish turning, less cutting force and surface roughness can be obtained when using <b>diamond</b> <b>tools.</b> The flank wears of <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> were less than cemented carbides.

50|$|Recent {{development}} work includes metal-diamond-composite heat sinks, {{for example in}} LED and laser applications. Sintering metal-diamond compounds with direct hot presses {{goes back to the}} 1950s since when it is commonly practised in the <b>diamond</b> <b>tool</b> industry.|$|E
50|$|A <b>diamond</b> <b>tool</b> is {{a cutting}} tool with diamond grains fixed on the {{functional}} parts of the tool via a bonding material or another method. As diamond is a superhard material, diamond tools have many advantages as compared with tools made with common abrasives such as corundum and silicon carbide.|$|E
5000|$|Ferrous {{materials}} are not readily machinable because the carbon in the <b>diamond</b> <b>tool</b> chemically reacts with the substrate, leading to tool damage and dulling after short cut lengths. Several techniques {{have been investigated}} to prevent this reaction, but few have been successful for long diamond machining processes at mass production scales.|$|E
40|$|Summary With <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> it is {{possible}} to achieve high surface qualities with one process step. To produce complex mouldings with a reduced amount of chipping runs new tools with free-form cutting edges will be used. However, this requires a high accuracy of the <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> which must be tested consequently and very precisely in real process time. The concept of the used measurement technique for the free-form <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> and the simulated results of a set-actual comparison of a cutting edge are presented...|$|R
50|$|All {{concrete}} grinders {{use some}} sort of abrasive to grind or polish such as <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> or Silicon carbide. The <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> used for grinding most commonly are diamond grinding cup wheels, and for polishing are usually diamond polishing pads.The use of <b>diamond</b> <b>tooling</b> {{is the most common}} type of abrasive used under concrete grinders and come in many grits that range from 6 grit to the high thousands, although 1800 grit is considered by the insurance industry as the highest shine to apply to a floor surface.|$|R

Methods of simulation and full-scale experiments based on the use of original ultrasound equipment created by the Moscow Aviation Institute have been devised. The new <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> have been applied in the TEKhNOLOGYA Scientific Production Complex (Obninsk), which made it possible to reduce the time required for processing silicon nitride and carbide and other materials and to lower the costs associated with it.

40|$|Abstract. Although <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> {{have been}} used for over a century, the diamond grits {{distribution}} in the matrix is not uniform. This is because the large and light diamond grits tend to segregate from the small and heavy metal powder during the mixing process, hence diamond distribution in the <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> is intrinsically heterogeneous. As a result, the cutting performance of the <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> cannot be optimized. In 1997, Dr. James Chien-Min Sung applied two historical patents that can allow the design of diamond distribution according to a predetermined pattern. As the result, the life of <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> may be doubled; and the cutting speed, may also be twice as high. The three-dimensional saw segments with arrayed diamond grits were made back in 1999 with the improved performance as predicted. The Sung invention can allow the <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> industry to make ideal saw segment that has variable diamond size and diamond separation at different regions. Conventional diamond saws contain diamond grits that are distributed randomly in a metal matrix, as a result, their cutting speeds are slow and their sawing lives are short. In 1997, Dr. James C. Sung applied new patents that revealed revolutionary technology for making <b>diamond</b> <b>tools</b> with <b>diamond</b> grits set in a predetermined pattern. The diamond placement design was first appeared in a series of DiaGrid products, such as wire saws and grinding wheels. In 1999...|$|R

50|$|Gravure {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} {{made of steel}} and plated with copper, though other materials, e.g. ceramics can also be used. The desired pattern is achieved by engraving with a laser or a <b>diamond</b> <b>tool,</b> or by chemical etching. If the cylinder is chemically etched, a resist (in {{the form of a}} negative image) is transferred to the cylinder before etching. The resist protects the non-image areas of the cylinder from the etchant. After etching, the resist is stripped off. The operation is analogous to the manufacture of printed circuit boards. Following engraving, the cylinder is proofed and tested, reworked if necessary, and then chrome plated.|$|E
50|$|The {{features}} of the diamond segments on a <b>diamond</b> <b>tool</b> should match {{the nature of the}} material to be cut. If the material is hard, the bond of the diamond segments should be softer. Because diamonds are apt to become blunt when cutting hard material. The softer bond can be worn down with the blunt diamonds faster, and then make new diamonds beneath be more easily exposed to participate in cutting. If the material is relatively softer, the bond should be harder. For in this case diamonds can last longer. The harder bond wears slower, so that it can hold the diamonds also longer. This can make better use of the diamonds and prolong the diamond tool's service life.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{influences}} of abrasive size, abrasive concentration and admixture way on the abrasive dispersing of the sintered ultra-fine <b>diamond</b> <b>tool</b> were systemically investigated. Then, {{a comparison of the}} abrasive dispersing was made between the sintered ultra-fine <b>diamond</b> <b>tool</b> and the newly developed ultra-fine <b>diamond</b> <b>tool</b> by gel technique. ESEM was applied to observe the abrasive dispersing of the sintered and gel-coupled ultra-fine diamond tools. The abrasive dispersing was quantitatively evaluated by the statistic laws of grit spacing in a certain area. Experimental results indicated that the dispersing was mainly influenced by the abrasive size. The ultra-fine abrasive tended to agglomerate with the decrease of grit sizes due to the increase of surface energies. The abrasive concentration and admixture way had few effects on abrasive dispersing.
