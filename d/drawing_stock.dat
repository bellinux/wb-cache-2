5000|$|The Spanish Mustang is an American horse breed {{descended from}} horses brought from Spain {{during the early}} conquest of the Americas. They are {{classified}} within the larger grouping of the Colonial Spanish horse, a type that today is rare in Spain. By the early 20th century, most of the once-vast herds of mustangs that had descended from the Spanish horses had been greatly reduced in size. Seeing that these horses were {{on the brink of}} extinction, some horseman began making efforts to find and preserve the remaining [...] "Spanish Mustangs" [...] <b>drawing</b> <b>stock</b> from feral and Native American herds, as well as ranch stock. The breed {{was one of the first}} to be part of a concerted preservation effort for horses of Spanish phenotype, and a breed registry was founded in 1957.|$|E

The trim bodice and covered petticoat, and little apron, with its pockets to receive the hands when in an attitude for conversation; the colored kerchief wound tastefully round the head, with a coquettish knot perking above one ear; and the neat slipper and tight <b>drawn</b> <b>stocking</b> with its braid of narrow ribbon embracing the ankle where it peeps from its mysterious curtain.

30|$|In {{other markets}} the {{unconditional}} link is more persistent. Visaltanachoti and Yang (2010) compare non-US and US firms {{and show that}} imbalances have more explanatory power for non-US firms, where significant effects last for up to 15 min. The analysis by Jiang et al. (2011) comprises 20 randomly <b>drawn</b> <b>stocks</b> traded on the Chinese stock exchanges Shanghai and Shenzhen and extends from 2000 to 2008. The average coefficients are highly significant for 10 - and 15 -min intervals before becoming insignificant from 30 min onwards. Chang and Shie (2011) deal with Taiwanese index futures from 2006 to 2007. At the 5 -min observation frequency, order imbalances {{are found to be}} related only to extreme (positive or negative) returns.|$|R
