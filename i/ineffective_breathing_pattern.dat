40|$|Aims. {{the aims}} {{of this study were}} to {{validate}} the signs and symptoms of the respiratory nursing diagnoses impaired gas exchange, ineffective airway clearance and <b>ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> in patients under mechanical ventilation; to verify whether intubation time and ventilatory modalities were related factors for respiratory nursing diagnoses; to verify the occurrence of shared signs and symptoms in the diagnoses and compare them with North American Nursing Diagnosis Association's proposition and to ascertain whether respiratory nursing diagnoses occur in isolated or associated patterns. Background. the need for mechanical ventilation is common in several patients admitted to intensive care units. Therefore, critical care nurses should identify the respiratory nursing diagnoses of high incidence. Design and methods. Descriptive observational study, with 177 evaluations of surgical and medical critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. the study adopted Fehring's Modified Clinical Diagnostic Validity Model, with a suggested alteration. Results. the critical signs and symptoms were the same as proposed by North American Nursing Diagnosis Association, when the diagnoses were separately identified, although no particular sign and symptom was found for <b>ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern.</b> Impaired gas exchange and ineffective airway clearance were identified as having 88 (49 - 7 %) evaluations sharing the critical signs and symptoms. Intubation time and ventilation modality were related factors for the development of ineffective airway clearance and <b>ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern.</b> Conclusion. the critical signs and symptoms of impaired gas exchange were abnormal blood gases and hypoxemia. for ineffective airway clearance, they were rhonchi and decreased breath sounds. No highlights were found for <b>ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> signs and symptoms. Validation by experts has confirmed these findings. the interface between ineffective airway clearance and impaired gas exchange was confirmed by the presence of the shared critical signs and symptoms. Relevance to clinical practice. Studies like this are relevant to clinical practice because they evaluate the adequacy of Taxonomy 11 for patients under mechanical ventilation in clinical practice, thus allowing for the intensive care nurses to go from one mechanical-and routine practice to a critical, reflexive practice, committed to professional progress.

40|$|Background : Infant {{and child}} {{mortality}} rate caused by Congenital Heart Disease quite high in both developed countries {{and developing countries}} (including Indonesia). With a population of 235 million in Indonesia, {{it was estimated that}} 50, 000 babies would born with congenital heart disease so that the number of prevalence was quite high. Lack of parents’knowledge and attention towards congenital heart disease one of the problems in handling children with congenital heart disease. It was required a sophisticated medical treatment so that children are able to survive soon after their birth. Objective : To implement nursing care in patients with congenital heart disease include assessment, intervention, implementation and evaluation of nursing care. Methods : The method used was case study approach that was defined as a scientific menthod to collect data, analyze the data method was to collect data, analyze the data and draw conclusions. Results :The emerging diagnosis on the case were of decreased cardiac output related to malformations ofthe heart, <b>ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> related to pulmonal congestion and intolerance activity were related to the imbalance of oxygen consumption by body and supply of oxygen to the cells.

40|$|Dysfunctional {{breathing}} {{is a term}} describing breathing disorders where chronic changes in <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> result in dyspnoea and other symptoms in the absence or {{in excess of the}} magnitude of physiological respiratory or cardiac disease. We reviewed the literature and propose a classification system for the common dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> described. The literature was searched using the terms: dysfunctional breathing, hyperventilation, Nijmegen questionnaire and thoraco-abdominal asynchrony. We have summarised the presentation, assessment and treatment of dysfunctional breathing, and propose that the following system be used for classification. 1) Hyperventilation syndrome: associated with symptoms both related to respiratory alkalosis and independent of hypocapnia. 2) Periodic deep sighing: frequent sighing with an irregular <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern.</b> 3) Thoracic dominant breathing: can often manifest in somatic disease, if occurring without disease it may be considered dysfunctional and results in dyspnoea. 4) Forced abdominal expiration: these patients utilise inappropriate and excessive abdominal muscle contraction to aid expiration. 5) Thoraco-abdominal asynchrony: where there is delay between rib cage and abdominal contraction resulting in <b>ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> mechanics. This review highlights the common abnormalities, current diagnostic methods and therapeutic implications in dysfunctional breathing.

We assessed the physiologic response to varying levels of NAVA and pressure support ventilation (PSV) in 13 tracheostomised patients with prolonged weaning. Each patient randomly underwent 8 trials, at four levels of assistance either in PSV and NAVA. i - high (no dyspnoea and/or distress); iv - low (associated with dyspnoea and/or distress; ii and iii - at ∼ 75 % and ∼ 25 % {{of the difference between}} high and low support respectively. We measured tidal volume (VT), peak EAdi, (EAdipeak) and airway pressure, <b>ineffective</b> efforts and <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> variability. With both NAVA and PSV, decreasing assistance resulted in parallel significant increase in EAdipeak associated with a concomitant reduction in VT and minute ventilation in PSV, but not in NAVA. VT variability significantly increased when reducing ventilatory assistance in PSV only, while remained unchanged varying the NAVA level. The ineffective triggering index was not significantly different between the two modes. In patients with prolonged weaning, with the specific settings adopted, compared to PSV, NAVA reduced the risk of over-assistance and overall improved patient-ventilator interaction, while not significantly affecting patient-ventilator synchrony...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{respiratory}} diseases (CRD) commonly {{present with}} abnormal <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> at rest. There is some limited evidence that <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> during speech (speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns),</b> differ in CRD compared to healthy individuals. Monitoring speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> could provide useful information {{about changes in}} respiratory health, however, little is currently known about speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> in CRD. This research aimed to explore and evaluate speech protocols, and characterise speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> in health and CRD. Information gathered was taken forward to explore the impact (if any) on speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> in patients with CRD before and after Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR). Respiratory Inductive Plethysmography (RIP) was used to quantify breathing/speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> during various speech tasks in three studies. In the first study, 29 healthy adults and 11 adults with self-reported asthma were characterised and speech breathing protocols were evaluated. The second study characterised 20 healthy older adults, and 20 patients with CRD (COPD= 14, bronchiectasis= 6) were assessed before and after a six week PR programme in the third study. Key novel findings were: 1) <b>Breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> were task specific between speech in healthy younger adults, but this finding could not be generalised to healthy older adults or patients with CRD. 2) Speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> differed between health and CRD, but were not disease specific. 3) A recording period of two minutes was sufficient to provide stable breathing parameters 4) Conversational speech was most useful for assessing speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns.</b> 5) No changes in speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> were observed after PR, but no changes in resting breathlessness or oxygen saturation were observed either. Conclusion: This research has permitted the optimisation of speech protocols for future research and produced new evidence from patient groups that contradicts previous assumptions about task specificity.

Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to report the prevalence of abnormal <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> during canter/gallop and to investigate whether these may be associated with dynamic upper respiratory tract (URT) obstructions. Study design: Retrospective analysis of clinical records. Methods: Simultaneous audio and URT videoendoscopy recordings from 365 horses referred for treadmill evaluation were analysed. Results: Thirty percent of horses had an abnormal <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> at canter or gallop, of which 23 % had a 2 : 1 <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> (i. e. one breath is taken over two strides). The prevalence of abnormal <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> was higher at low canter speeds than during strenuous exercise. There was a significant association between <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> during strenuous exercise and the presence of an URT obstruction. Conclusions: This study suggests that abnormal <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> during canter and gallop may be associated with dynamic URT obstructions; therefore, horses identified by owners or veterinary surgeons to have an abnormal <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> during exercise, in particular a 2 : 1 <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern,</b> may warrant investigations for diagnosis of respiratory tract disease.

Estudo transversal, realizado em um hospital de nÃvel secundÃrio da rede pÃblica de Fortaleza (CE), nos meses de abril a setembro de 2013. A amostra foi composta por 205 crianÃas. Os dados foram coletados por meio de uma avaliaÃÃo pulmonar e entrevista com os responsÃveis. As informaÃÃes obtidas foram analisadas para determinar a presenÃa ou ausÃncia dos indicadores clÃnicos dos diagnÃsticos em estudo. Posteriormente, esses dados foram encaminhados a enfermeiros diagnosticadores para inferÃncia diagnÃstica. Foram utilizados os softwares Excel e SPSS para organizaÃÃo e anÃlise estatÃstica dos dados. O nÃvel de significÃncia adotado foi de 5 %. O estudo adotou os princÃpios Ãticos e recebeu parecer Ãtico favorÃvel (parecer nÂ 237. 389 / 13). Houve uma discreta prevalÃncia para o sexo masculino (52, 3 %) e mediana de idade de 36 meses.

DesobstruÃÃo ineficaz de vias aÃreas apresentou dispneia, mudanÃa na frequÃncia respiratÃria, mudanÃa no ritmo respiratÃrio, ortopneia, ruÃdos adventÃcios e tosse ineficaz como indicadores mais prevalentes. MudanÃa na frequÃncia respiratÃria, mudanÃa no ritmo respiratÃrio, ortopneia, ruÃdos adventÃcios respiratÃrios, sons respiratÃrios diminuÃdo e tosse ineficaz apresentaram associaÃÃo estatisticamente significante com este diagnÃstico. E ruÃdos adventÃcios respiratÃrios e tosse ineficaz mostraram-se como os indicadores mais acurados. PadrÃo respiratÃrio ineficaz apresentou ortopneia, taquipneia e uso da musculatura acessÃria para respirar como os indicadores mais prevalentes. Evidenciou-se associaÃÃo estatisticamente significante de alteraÃÃes na profundidade respiratÃria, taquipneia, uso da musculatura acessÃria e ortopneia com PadrÃo respiratÃrio ineficaz. Uso da musculatura acessÃria para respirar, alteraÃÃes da profundidade respiratÃria e ortopneia apresentaram-se como mais acurados para padrÃo respiratÃrio ineficaz. Troca de gases prejudicada apresentou dispneia, respiraÃÃo anormal, taquicardia e hipoxemia como os indicadores mais prevalentes. Hipoxemia foi o Ãnico indicador que mostrou associaÃÃo estatisticamente significativa, alÃm de manifestar-se como mais acurado para troca de gases prejudicada.

The {{planning to}} lead the care and to support the nursing knowledge in specific clinical situations {{is based on the}} use of accurate nursing diagnoses. The use of good clinical indicators for predicting diagnosis is essential in order to reach this precision. This study aimed at determining the measures of accuracy of clinical indicators for nursing diagnosis, such as: Ineffective airway clearance, <b>Ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern,</b> Impaired gas exchange and Impaired spontaneous ventilation in asthmatic children through a cross-sectional study held in a secondary level public hospital in Fortaleza (CE), from April to September 2013. The sample consisted of 205 children with asthma whose data were collected through a pulmonary assessment and interviews with their parents. The data were analyzed by the researcher to determine the presence or absence of: Ineffective airway clearance; Ineffective breathing pattern; Impaired gas exchange and Impaired spontaneous ventilation indicators based on a research protocol and then diagnostician nurses analyzed this information for diagnostic inference. For statistical analysis, SPSS and Excel were used with a significance level of 5 %. The study adopted the ethical principles and received the assent of the Federal University of CearÃ Ethics and Research (opinion No. 237. 389 / 13). There was a slight prevalence for males (52. 3 %) and average age of 36 months. 89. 3 % of the children assessed developed Ineffective airway clearance; 86. 8 % developed Ineffective breathing pattern; 28. 8 % developed Impaired gas exchange and 5. 9 % of the children developed Impaired spontaneous ventilation. Ineffective airway clearance presented dyspnea, change in respiratory rate, change in respiratory rhythm, orthopnea, rales and ineffective cough as the most prevalent indicators. Change in respiratory rate, change in respiratory rhythm, orthopnea, respiratory rales, decreased breath sounds and ineffective cough showed a significant association with this diagnosis whereas ineffective cough and respiratory rales appeared as the most accurate indicators. <b>Ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> had orthopnea, tachypnea and use of accessory muscles to breathe as the most prevalent indicator. A statistically significant association between changes in respiratory depth, tachypnea, accessory muscle use and orthopnea with <b>Ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> was also observed in this study. The Use of accessory muscles for breathing, changes in respiratory depth and orthopnea were observed as more accurate for <b>Ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern.</b> Impaired gas exchange presented dyspnea, abnormal breathing, tachycardia and hypoxemia as the most prevalent indicators. Hypoxemia was the only indicator that showed a statistically significant association, and were seen as more accurate for Impaired gas exchange. For Impaired spontaneous ventilation dyspnea, increased heart rate and decreased SaO 2 were the most prevalent indicators. Decreased cooperation, decreased SaO 2 and increased use of accessory muscles to breathe were significantly associated with Impaired spontaneous ventilation and increased use of accessory muscles to breathe was presented with better accuracy. For the association between diagnoses, Ineffective airway clearance remained related to <b>Ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> and Impaired gas exchange and <b>Ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> remained related to Impaired gas exchange. Impaired spontaneous ventilation showed no association.

The most frequently detected nursing diagnoses were: activity intolerance, impaired spontaneous ventilation, <b>ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern,</b> risk for aspiration, delayed growth and development, Ineffective breastfeeding, Ineffective infant feeding pattern, hyperthermia / hypothermia, risk for infection, impaired tissue integrity, Interrupted family processes, risk for impaired parenting, risk for impaired attachment, interrupted family processes. Diagnoses applying to parents' psychosocial sphere were identified, enabling the newborn's integral evaluation, including the family. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing diagnoses provide nurses working in neonatal units the opportunity of an effective management of the care process {{as well as the}} availability of the needed data in order to continuously improve a quality-based nursing care. The use of one model or more reference models represents a way to help professional action...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{to analyze}} the manifestation of the {{defining}} characteristics of the nursing diagnoses of <b>ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> and impaired spontaneous ventilation, of the NANDA International and the defining characteristics identified in the literature for the concept of “ventilation” in adult patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit with use of oxygen therapy. Method: clinical diagnostic validation study, conducted with 626 patients in intensive care using oxygen therapy, in three different modalities. Multiple correspondence {{analysis was used to}} verify the discriminative capacity of the defining characteristics and latent class analysis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of them, based on the severity level defined by the ventilatory mode used. Results: in the multiple correspondence analysis, it was demonstrated {{that the majority of the}} defining characteristics presented low discriminative capacity and low percentage of explained variance for the two dimensions (diagnoses). Latent class models, separately adjusted for the two diagnoses, presented a worse fit, with sharing of some defining characteristics. Models adjusted by level of severity (ventilation mode) presented better fit and structure of the component defining characteristics. Conclusion: clinical evidence obtained in the present study seems to demonstrate that the set of defining characteristics of the two nursing diagnoses studied fit better in a single construct...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} of the review was the analysis of Czech and foreign literature sources and professional periodicals to obtain a relevant comprehensive overview of validation studies of nursing diagnoses in neonatology. Design: Review. Methods: The selection criterion was studies concerning the validation of nursing diagnoses in neonatology. To obtain data from relevant sources, the licensed professional databases EBSCO, Web of Science and Scopus were utilized. The search criteria were: date of publication - unlimited; academic periodicals - full text; peer-reviewed periodicals; search language - English, Czech and Slovak. Results: A total of 788 studies were found. Only 5 studies were eligible for content analysis, dealing specifically with validation of nursing diagnoses in neonatology. The analysis of the retrieved studies suggests that authors are most often concerned with identifying the defining characteristics of nursing diagnoses applicable to both the mother (parents) and the newborn. The diagnoses were validated in the domains Role Relationship; Coping/Stress tolerance; Activity/Rest, and Elimination and Exchange. Diagnoses represented were {{from the field of}} dysfunctional physical needs as well as the field of psychosocial and spiritual needs. The diagnoses were as follows: Parental role conflict (00064); Impaired parenting (00056); Grieving (00136); <b>Ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> (00032); Impaired gas exchange (00030); and Impaired spontaneous ventilation (00033). Conclusion: Validation studies enable effective planning of interventions with measurable results and support clinical nursing practice...|$|E

Present study investigates postural sway and <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> as factors that differentiate between skill level and whether these {{factors contribute to}} shooting performance. Forty-two recurve archers participated and were assigned into two groups, skilled (n = 21) and unskilled (n = 21), where their performance level was based upon rank tournaments (International Archery Federation [FITA]) score. For skilled group, it comprised of archers who had obtained scores of 1150 upon 1440. Unskilled group were archers who had never participated in any ranked tournaments but possessed the basic shooting knowledge. Their aged ranged 13 to 25 years old. Postural sway and <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> were assessed by using Zephyr Bio-Harness at three phases; (i) set up, (ii) aiming, and (iii) release. Participants shot 12 arrows to a 30 -meter target. Significant changes in postural sway across shooting phases were found only in skilled group (p < 0. 05), while significant change in <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> were noted for both groups (p < 0. 05). Between group’s analyses, significance difference in postural sway were demonstrated for all phases (p < 0. 05). <b>Breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> {{were found to be}} significant only during set up and aiming phase (p < 0. 05). Postural sway during set up and release phase respectively (r = - 0. 168, p < 0. 05 [set up], r = 0. 278, p < 0. 05 [release]) and <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> during release phase (r = 0. 129, p < 0. 05) contributed to the shooting performance of skilled archers. Postural sway during set up phase (r = - 0. 108, p < 0. 05) was the only contributor in unskilled archers shooting performance. <b>Breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> was found to affect postural sway in skilled group performances (r = 0. 146, p < 0. 05). Control of postural stability was proven to be difficult where most of the time athletes swayed due to automaticity of movements, division of attentional demands, technical flaws, and control of <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern.</b> The swayed was greater in unskilled archers. In summary, postural sway and <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> contributed towards the shooting performance and the ability to cope with it guaranteed the accomplishment of the sport...|$|R

Assim, este estudo analisou como os diagnÃsticos de enfermagem PadrÃo respiratÃrio ineficaz (PRI), DesobstruÃÃo ineficaz das vias aÃreas (DIVA), Troca de gases prejudicada (TGP) e VentilaÃÃo espontÃnea prejudicada (VEP) apresentam-se no perÃodo pÃs-operatÃrio em crianÃas com cardiopatias congÃnitas, determinando as medidas de acurÃcia das caracterÃsticas definidoras. Foi desenvolvido um estudo de coorte prospectiva em um {{hospital}} infantil da rede pÃblica do municÃpio de Fortaleza-CE. A amostra foi composta por 54 crianÃas com idade entre 1 e 10 anos portadoras de cardiopatias congÃnitas em pÃs-operatÃrio de cirurgia cardÃaca. As crianÃas foram acompanhadas por um perÃodo mÃnimo de cinco dias e mÃximo de dez dias. Para a coleta de dados, foi utilizado um instrumento baseado nas CD dos diagnÃsticos de enfermagem estudados e na literatura pertinente acerca da avaliaÃÃo pulmonar. Os dados foram coletados por meio de exame fÃsico da crianÃa e entrevista com os responsÃveis. As informaÃÃes obtidas foram analisadas pela pesquisadora para determinar a presenÃa ou ausÃncia das CD de PRI, DIVA, TGP e VEP e estes dados foram organizados em planilhas. Posteriormente, as planilhas foram encaminhados para enfermeiros diagnosticadores que executaram o processo de inferÃncia diagnÃstica. Foram utilizados os softwares Excel e SPSS para organizaÃÃo e anÃlise estatÃstica dos dados. O nÃvel de significÃncia adotado foi de 5 %. Das crianÃas avaliadas, 30 (55, 5 %) desenvolveram DIVA, 25 (46, 3 %) desenvolveram TGP e 21 (38, 8 %) apresentaram PRI durante o perÃodo de acompanhamento. Para a inferÃncia de DIVA, a CD mais acurada foi ruÃdos adventÃcios respiratÃrios e para PRI, a caracterÃstica que apresentou as maiores medidas de acurÃcia foi uso da musculatura acessÃria para respirar. JÃ para a inferÃncia de TGP, a caracterÃstica mais acurada foi hipoxemia. Para o diagnÃstico de enfermagem VEP, nÃo foi possÃvel estabelecer relaÃÃes estatisticamente significantes de acurÃcia das caracterÃsticas definidoras. Com base na anÃlise de correspondÃncias mÃltiplas, as CD que mais auxiliaram na diferenciaÃÃo entre os diagnÃsticos PRI, DIVA e TGP foram: mudanÃa na frequÃncia respiratÃria, quantidade excessiva de muco, ruÃdos adventÃcios respiratÃrios, tosse ausente e taquipneia para DIVA, dispneia, batimento de asa de nariz, mudanÃa no ritmo respiratÃrio e uso da musculatura acessÃria para respirar para PRI e diÃxido de carbono diminuÃdo, gases sanguÃneos arteriais anormais, pH arterial anormal e PO 2 diminuÃda para TGP. Os resultados obtidos ajudaram a identificar as CD mais representativas de PRI, DIVA e TGP em crianÃas em evoluÃÃo pÃs-operatÃria cardÃaca. Estudos desta natureza sÃo importantes por fornecer informaÃÃes sobre a capacidade preditiva das caracterÃsticas definidoras bem como a evoluÃÃo temporal e as particularidades dos diagnÃsticos de enfermagem respiratÃrios. Studies {{that address}} the defining characteristics (DC) {{can contribute to the}} improvement of diagnostic reasoning, directly influencing the choice of nursing diagnoses most suitable for clinical situation of the patient. This study examined how nursing diagnoses <b>ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> (IBP), ineffective airway clearance (IAC), impaired gas exchange (IGE) and impaired spontaneous ventilation (ISV) presented themselves during the post-operative period in children with congenital heart diseases and showed the measures of accuracy of the defining characteristics. It was developed an cohort study in a hospital in the public network in Fortaleza-CE. The sample was consisted of 54 children aged 5 - 17 years with congenital heart diseases in post-operative of cardiac surgery. The children were followed for a minimum period of five and maximum of ten days. To collect the data, it was used an instrument based on the characteristics of the diagnostics studied and some relevant literature about the lung evaluation. The data were collected through examination of the child and interview with their parents. The information obtained were analyzed by the researcher to determine {{the presence or absence of}} DC of nursing diagnoses IBP, IAC, IGE e ISV and data was organized into spreadsheets. After, the spreadsheets were sent to nurses diagnosticians that performed the diagnostic inference process. It was used Excel and PASW software for organizing and analyzing statistical data. The level of significance was 5 %. Among children evaluated, 30 (55, 5 %) developed IAC, 25 (46, 3 %) developed IGE e 21 (38, 8 %) developed IBP during the monitoring period. In order to infer IAC, the DC most accurate was respiratory rales and to IBP the characteristic that presented the highest accuracy measurements was use of accessory muscles to breathe. As for the inference IGE, the characteristic most accurate was hypoxemia. For the nursing diagnosis ISV, was not possible to establish statistically significant accuracy of defining characteristics. Based on the analysis of multiple matches, the best characteristics that assist in differentiating between the diagnoses IBP, IAC e IGE were: change in respiratory rate, excessive amount of mucus, respiratory rales, cough absent and tachypnea to IAC; dyspnea, nasal flaring, change in respiratory rate and use of accessory muscles breathing to IBP e carbon dioxide decreased, abnormal arterial blood gases, abnormal arterial pH e PO 2 decreased to IGE. The results helped identify the DC more representative of IBP, IAC e IGE in children with congenital heart diseases in post-operative period. Studies of this nature are important for providing information about the predictive ability of the defining characteristics and the temporal evolution and characteristics of the respiratory nursing diagnoses...|$|E

Diante do exposto, o estudo teve como objetivo determinar as medidas de acurÃcia das CD do diagnÃstico de enfermagem PadrÃo respiratÃrio ineficaz (PRI) em crianÃas e adolescentes com cardiopatias congÃnitas (CC). A amostra incluiu 61 crianÃas e adolescentes com idade de 5 a 17 anos, diagnosticados com CC. Estes indivÃduos foram examinados pela pesquisadora, que realizou um exame fÃsico, enfocando a avaliaÃÃo respiratÃria. Em seguida, o mÃdico que atendia o paciente foi consultado para autorizar a realizaÃÃo dos testes de funÃÃo pulmonar (espirometria e manovacuometria). As informaÃÃes obtidas a partir do exame fÃsico e realizaÃÃo dos testes foram analisadas pela pesquisadora para determinar a presenÃa ou ausÃncia das CD de PRI, com base em um protocolo previamente estabelecido. Ressalta-se que 30 crianÃas e adolescentes nÃo receberam anuÃncia mÃdica para realizar os testes de funÃÃo pulmonar. Apesar disto, estes sujeitos foram incluÃdos na amostra para determinaÃÃo do diagnÃstico apenas com base nas CD provenientes da entrevista e do exame fÃsico. Com isto, duas subamostras foram formadas, sendo a primeira composta por 30 crianÃas e adolescentes que nÃo realizaram os referidos testes, e a segunda por 31 indivÃduos que realizaram tais exames. O conjunto de CD para cada crianÃa e adolescente foi organizado em 92 planilhas. Nestas, foi assinalada a presenÃa ou ausÃncia da CD. Cada avaliaÃÃo dos indivÃduos da segunda subamostra deu origem a duas planilhas, uma apenas com as CD provenientes da entrevista e exame clÃnico, e outra com estes mesmos dados acrescidos Ãs informaÃÃes dos testes de funÃÃo pulmonar. Tais planilhas foram submetidas a dois enfermeiros diagnosticadores que determinaram a ocorrÃncia de PRI. A anÃlise das inferÃncias e as informaÃÃes sobre a ocorrÃncia das CD possibilitaram a estimativa das medidas de acurÃcia. Para a primeira subamostra, a caracterÃstica que evidenciou melhores medidas de acurÃcia foi taquipneia. As inferÃncias {{realizadas}} para a segunda subamostra, com base nos dados clÃnicos e de entrevista, apresentaram como principais CD: ortopneia e uso da musculatura acessÃria para respirar. Quando os resultados dos testes de funÃÃo pulmonar foram acrescidos, as inferÃncias dos diagnosticadores nÃo evidenciaram medidas de acurÃcia com significÃncia estatÃstica para nenhuma das CD. Com isto, os resultados do presente estudo levantam questionamentos acerca da importÃncia dos testes de funÃÃo pulmonar para a inferÃncia do diagnÃstico PRI. Ademais, algumas caracterÃsticas nÃo mostraram legitimidade para PRI, a saber: assumir uma posiÃÃo de trÃs pontos, bradipneia, diÃmetro Ãntero-posterior aumentado, capacidade vital diminuÃda, pressÃo expiratÃria diminuÃda e ventilaÃÃo-minuto diminuÃda. Assim, acredita-se que novas pesquisas sÃo necessÃrias tanto para confirmar estes achados, como para esclarecer a relaÃÃo de tais CD com o diagnÃstico em questÃo. As medidas de acurÃcia obtidas ajudaram a identificar quais CD sÃo mais representativas de PRI. AlÃm disto, os resultados possibilitaram reconhecer quais caracterÃsticas sÃo menos utilizadas durante a inferÃncia deste diagnÃstico em crianÃas e adolescentes com cardiopatias congÃnitas. Studies which {{address the}} accuracy of the defining characteristics (DC) may contribute to the improvement of diagnostic reasoning, leading to the formulation of nursing diagnoses which are more consistent with the clinical situation of the patient. Thus, the study aimed to estimate the measures of accuracy of the DC of the nursing diagnosis <b>Ineffective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> (IBP) in children and adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD). The sample included 61 children and adolescents aged 5 - 17 years, diagnosed with CHD. These patients were examined by the researcher, who conducted a physical examination, focusing on the respiratory evaluation. Then the doctor who attended the patient was consulted to authorize the performance of pulmonary function tests (spirometry and manovacuometry). The information obtained from physical examination and from the tests were analyzed by the researcher to determine {{the presence or absence of}} DC of IBP, based on a previously established protocol. It is highlighted that 30 children and adolescents have not received medical approval to perform the pulmonary function tests. Despite this, these patients were sampled to determine the diagnosis just based on the DC from the interview and physical examination. Thus, two subsamples were formed, the first with 30 children and adolescents who did not perform such tests, and the second with 31 individuals who carried out such tests. The set of DC for each child and teenager was organized into 92 spreadsheets. In these, it was indicated the presence or absence of the DC. Each evaluation of the patients in the second subsample resulted in two spreadsheets, one only with the DC from the interview and clinical examination, and another with these same data added information from the pulmonary function tests. These spreadsheets were submitted to two nurses diagnosticians which determined the occurrence of IBP. The analysis of the inferences and the information on the occurrence of DC allowed the estimation of measures of accuracy. For the first subsample, the DC that showed better measures of accuracy was tachypnea. The inferences made for the second subsample, based on clinical data and interviews, presented as main DC: orthopnea and use of accessory muscles to breathe. When the results of pulmonary function tests were added, the inferences of the diagnosticians showed accuracy measures without statistical significance for all DC. With this, the results of this study raise questions about the importance of pulmonary function tests for the inference of the nursing diagnosis IBP. Furthermore, some DC showed no legitimacy for IBP, as follows: assumption of three point position, bradypnea, increased anterior-posterior diameter, decreased vital capacity, decreased expiratory pressure, and decreased minute ventilation. Thus, it is believed that further research is needed to confirm these findings, as well as to clarify the relationship of such DC with the diagnosis IBP. The measures of accuracy obtained helped identify which DC is more representative of IBP. Moreover, the results allowed to recognize which features are less used during the inference of this diagnosis in children and adolescents with congenital heart disease...|$|E

40|$|Background circle Heart rate {{variability}} (HRV) biofeedback is a self-regulation strategy used {{to improve}} conditions including asthma, stress, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Respiratory muscle function affects hemodynamic influences on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and HRV and HRV-biofeedback protocols often include slow abdominal breathing to achieve physiologically optimal patterns of HRV with power spectral distribution concentrated around the 0. 1 -Hz frequency and large amplitude. It is likely that optimal balanced <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> and ability to entrain heart rhythms to breathing reflect physiological efficiency and resilience and that individuals with dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> may have difficulty voluntarily modulating HRV and RSA.
