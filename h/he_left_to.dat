5|$|After suppressing a minor {{rebellion}} in Wales in 1276–77, Edward {{responded to a}} second {{rebellion in}} 1282–83 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, Edward subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom. In the war that followed, the Scots persevered, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. At {{the same time there}} were problems at home.

These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled.
