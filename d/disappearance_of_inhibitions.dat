A comparison between different synthetic multifunctional pores reveals that the location of functional groups in rigid-rod beta-barrel pores is precisely reflected in the function: molecular recognition at the outer barrel surface results in pore opening, while molecular recognition at the inner barrel surface results in pore closing. Negligible nonspecific leakage, <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> pH gating, <b>inhibition</b> <b>of</b> intervesicular pore transfer, and maybe also the flickering of currents of single open pores characterize external ligands as adhesive cushions that liberate the pore from lateral pressure exerted by the surrounding membrane.

40|$|The {{ability of}} 18 gram-negative {{bacterial}} isolates to detoxify diisopropyl fluorophosphate, a structural analog {{of the agents}} soman and sarin, was investigated. Detoxification by both frozen cell sonicates and acetone powders was assayed by two methods, i. e., the hydrolytic release of fluoride, measured by a fluoride-specific ion electrode, and the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> acetylcholinesterase <b>inhibition</b> in vitro. Frozen cell sonicates for all strains exhibited some activity (F- ion release). In general, acetone powder preparations produced higher activity than frozen cell sonicates did, and the highest activities were exhibited by strains with known parathion hydrolase activity. Two ranges in activity were observed, low level, ranging from 0. 1 to 7. 0 mumol/min per g of protein, and high level, detected only in parathion hydrolase-producing strains, from 47 to greater than 300 mumol/min per g of protein.

40|$|Stimulation of rat {{neutrophils}} {{with the}} peptide fMetLeuPhe caused (i) {{the appearance of}} a 40 kDa protein in the Triton-X- 100 -insoluble cytoskeleton, (ii) the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> DNAase <b>inhibition</b> from the cytosol and (iii) the appearance of N-(7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) phallacidin (NBD-phallacidin) binding sites. All three observations were consistent with a rapid and transient assembly of polymerized actin, peaking at approximately 5 s and returning to near resting levels within 40 s. By experimentally depleting the cells of Ca 2 + and increasing the cytoplasmic Ca 2 + buffering capacity, the peptide-induced Ca 2 + transient was reduced from a peak of 900 nM to 250 nM, without inhibiting actin polymerization, and this peak was sustained for at least 2 min. A further dissociation between the triggering of actin polymerization and peptide-induced Ca 2 + elevation and oxidase activation was demonstrated at low concentrations of peptide (1 - 100 pM), actin polymerization being triggered without an elevation in Ca 2 + or activation of the oxidase. Two other agents which induced actin polymerization, phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate and latex beads, failed to elevate cytoplasmic Ca 2 +. It was therefore concluded that neither Ca 2 + nor those intracellular messengers which act with Ca 2 + to trigger the neutrophil oxidase are responsible for triggering actin polymerization in neutrophil...|$|R
40|$|Malate {{has been}} noted to be a `mixed' {{inhibitor}} of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase. The competitive portion <b>of</b> this <b>inhibition</b> appears to be fairly constant regardless of {{the condition of the}} enzyme being measured, but the noncompetitive (V-type) inhibition is subject to variation depending on the source of the enzyme, its storage condition, {{the presence or absence of}} various ligands, and differences in pH. In the case of the maize (Zea mays L.) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), the V-type inhibition by malate is much less pronounced at pH 8 than at pH 7. Examination of the response of the maize PEPC to PEP concentration reveals a pronounced cooperativity at pH 8 which is not present at pH 7, and which results in the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> the V-type <b>inhibition</b> at pH 8. The ability of high concentrations of PEP to convert PEPC from a form readily inhibited by malate to one resistant to malate inhibition has been previously demonstrated and we attribute the cooperativity shown at pH 8 to this response to high levels of PEP. Support for this proposal is provided by studies of the enzyme at pH 7 and pH 8 run in 20 % glycerol. In this case there was no V-type <b>inhibition</b> <b>of</b> PEPC at either pH.

40|$|Neurophysiologic {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} parkinsonian rigidity are poorly understood. In any case, {{they have to}} fit all the clinical data which are first reviewed before discussing 2 theories which are proposed to interpret rigidity. The first theory postulates that increased resistance to mobilization is due to hyperactivity in a long loop reflex pathway which originates at the neuromuscular spindles and relays in the motor cortex. This theory {{is based on the}} largely accepted finding that, in parkinsonian patients, M 2 response is increased when a voluntary movement is abruptly stopped. Although popular this hypothesis is far from explaining all the clinical facts, namely that rigidity is equal in extensor and flexor, proximal and distal muscles. Based on a reflex set by primary afferent discharges, it is incompatible with the lack of rigidity reinforcement after faster passive mobilization. The second theory rests on data obtained from electrophysiological studies of some spinal interneurones. Both IA and IB inhibitory interneurones are functionally modified but not in the same direction. While the IA inhibitory interneurone is facilitated, the IB inhibitory interneurone is less active. <b>Disappearance</b> <b>of</b> autogenic <b>inhibition</b> can explain rigidity at rest and the tonic stretch reflex. In addition, interneurones intervening in the flexor reflex disclose a modified excitability. It is possible to interpret these facts by postulating an abnormal influence transmitted through descending reticulospinal pathways. This abnormal influence would result from modified activation of reticular nuclei by afferents projecting from the basal ganglia. Such a hypothesis is open to experimental testing through the startle reaction. The latter facilitates the H reflex by the reticulospinal pathways, the influence of cortex [...] if any [...] being negligible. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Deuterated {{tyrosine}} {{has been}} used to study tyrosine metabolism in one normal and two patients with rare forms of non-hepatic tyrosinaemia. The labelled tyrosine was ingested orally, after which urine and serum samples were examined by GC-MS at regular intervals for residual labelled tyrosine and tyrosine metabolites. The derivatives of choice for GC-MS were the O-methyl ether of the N-neopentylidene tyrosine methyl ester, the trimethyl silyl derivatives of the phenolic acids and the N-trifluoroacetyl O-trimethyl silyl derivatives of the catecholamines. It was shown that loading rates of 220 μmoles of deuterated tyrosine/kg body weight were adequate for precise measurement of the stable isotope content of urinary and serum tyrosine and tyrosine metabolites. This load approximates to that provided by a protein containing meal, so these stable isotope load studies can be claimed to mimic physiological conditions. The amount of deuterated substrate used in this study was not considered a health risk, as even complete isotope retention in vivo would only increase the natural abundance in the body by less than 20 %. Deuteration experiments were made with a combined GC-MS instrument operating under computer control using time averaging and mass fragmentometry. The studies on the two patients and a normal control were carried out under conditions of high and low tyrosine loads. The results of these studies defined the biochemical lesion in one patient at the site of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid oxidase. Although the site of the primary defect in the other patient has not been established. It is clear that it is not at the site of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid oxidase. This patient suffered from substrate <b>inhibition</b> <b>of</b> p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid oxidase when on a normal diet. Resolution of the clinical and biochemical symptoms with <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inhibition</b> <b>of</b> p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid oxidase occurred with the implementation of a diet low in phenylalanine and tyrosine. Although the fundamental defect in this patient is not resolved, the findings appear compatible with a defect in hepatic soluble tyrosine aminotransferase.
