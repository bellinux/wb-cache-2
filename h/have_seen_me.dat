5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, I asked {{him where he}} was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
500|$|Before the album's release, in December 2012, Cudi {{dedicated}} Indicud to {{the late}} Ben Breedlove and all his fans who died, continuing: [...] "My journey shall continue in your honor. Never forgotten." [...] The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always try to push myself {{to the next level}} with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When I started working on Indicud, I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. Most of my old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side of me that people haven’t seen?' The only time people <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just wanted to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{player from}} the fifth season, Dakota Fisher of Eliot, Maine, echoed the feeling, {{saying that his}} {{appearance}} on Endurance left him with relationships he will never forget. [...] "You should <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> {{a week after the}} show, it was depressing", said the 15-year-old who had been trying for two years to get on the Emmy-nominated teen reality program.|$|E
60|$|The Prince <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me,</b> and {{he stood}} still. I faced him at once.|$|R

5000|$|... "If {{you know}} me, {{then you will}} also know my Father" [...] and [...] "Whoever <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> the Father".|$|R
2500|$|That evening Jesus {{appeared}} among them, {{despite having}} locked the doors, {{and gives them}} power over sin and forgiveness of sin. A week later he appears to doubting Thomas, who has not believed, but when Thomas is instructed to touch the wounds of Jesus he says, [...] "My Lord and my God!" [...] Jesus replies: [...] "Because you <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me,</b> you have believed; blessed {{are those who have}} not seen and yet have believed".|$|E
60|$|Presently had any {{been looking}} they might <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> to start.|$|E
6000|$|Harry was {{stalking}} {{to and fro}} {{across the}} floor with fiery eagerness, sobbing bitterly to himself, and pausing {{every now and then}} with a sort of sudden spasmodic hesitation. From time to time she heard him mutter aloud, [...] "She must <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me!</b> She must <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me!</b> They will tell her, they will tell her! Oh, God! they will tell her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You trouble {{yourself}} unnecessarily on my account," [...] was the smoothly ironic answer. [...] "No one <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> come, {{and no one}} {{is likely}} to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> depart." ...|$|R
6000|$|Isabel considered. [...] "Relations? They're hardly relations. That's {{the strange}} part of it: he <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> but {{three or four}} times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is sufficient, sir; and I have no apprehensions of disagreeable {{consequences}} {{from your}} <b>having</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> in this house,' said the priest.|$|R
60|$|Jac. If {{you pray}} against me before you <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me,</b> you'll curse {{me when you}} have looked on me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> again--as {{you saw me}} in the summer-house by the waterfall!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Was it in Scotland once more?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You might {{certainly}} <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me.</b> But {{you never}} looked towards me. It's useless {{to ask the}} question. I am sure you never saw me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And do {{you wish}} that I should put her off,--or put Oswald off,--or both? My brother never yet <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> in your house." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bender, quietly confident, {{took his}} time to reply. [...] "Well, if you <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> up on that chair you'd have thought I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think he's {{tired of}} me," [...] said Nick; [...] "he hasn't been near me either. But after all it's natural--he <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen, {{the sealed}} {{envelope}} which you <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> open is endorsed 'My Last Will and Testament--ROGER MELTON, June, 1906.' This document"--holding it up--"is as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dick!" [...] she cried, [...] "alas the {{day that}} ever ye should <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me!</b> For like a most unhappy and unthankful maid, it is I have led you hither." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shouldn't {{have given}} me away, Buster Bear, just because you <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> roll down hill before in the Great Woods where we both came from," [...] said he.|$|E
6000|$|I was dumfounded by this movement. What {{did they}} mean {{by going to}} the very place I had just vacated? Was it {{possible}} they <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was plain}} Rupert had said nothing of <b>having</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me,</b> or of our {{interview}} in the street. He seemed a little ashamed, and leaned forward to say-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet, Mrs. Hardinge <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> {{often in}} a round-about, and passed hours in my company, when I have been dressed just as I am at this moment." ...|$|R
60|$|Dejah Thoris must <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> at {{the same}} instant, for she screamed a useless warning just as Thurid's foot, {{swinging}} in a mighty kick, landed full in my face.|$|E
6000|$|... "It looked so," [...] murmured Hal to himself. [...] "I {{must be more}} {{cautious}} in the future. He must <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> when I started to hide behind the bill-board." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor {{would you}} <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> to-day, had I not known you were kind and pure-hearted, or had I not {{resolved}} {{to ask you}} to exercise your powers upon me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bill {{broke out}} in a cold {{perspiration}} all over. [...] "You'll be careful, won't you, Silas?" [...] he ses. [...] "You'll remember you <b>'ave</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> once, I mean?" ...|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{he seemed}} to dismiss the theme {{altogether}} from his mind, and proceeded to inquire how I got free from the party in whose hands he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Caroline <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> at the castle," [...] {{said his}} bride doubtfully, [...] "but I shouldn't say she knows me. She has hardly spoken a dozen words to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{may be a}} fool, {{but you are not}} sure. Many thanks! You <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> half a dozen times. You {{are either}} very slow or I am very deep." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carrie smiled, {{but there}} was some color in her face. [...] "I suppose you mean to be nice. Yet you <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> serving at the store and cooking for the boys!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{took his}} self-reproach literally. [...] "You couldn't <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me.</b> I was sitting pretty far back, and I went out {{before any of}} your family saw me. Don't you go there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Ease and plenty! house!” {{repeated}} Natty, slowly. “You mean well, {{you mean}} well, and I quite mourn that it cannot be; but he <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> a sight and a laughing-stock for—” ...|$|R
60|$|I was irritated and disquieted. I {{had been}} very earnest in my attentions to Mother Anastasia. Perhaps this lady <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> attempt to kiss her hand. I must set myself right.|$|R
60|$|An odd thought {{has just}} come to me. I wonder what might have happened, if I had been visiting at Mrs. Staveley's, instead of Eunice, and if Mr. Dunboyne <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> first.|$|R
