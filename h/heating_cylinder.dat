A bronze cylinder covered with oil was heated like a furnace with charcoal beneath until its sides became extremely hot. The victim was made to walk on top of the slowly <b>heating</b> <b>cylinder</b> and he was forced to shift his feet to avoid the burning. The oily surface made it difficult for the victim to maintain his position and balance. If the victim fell into the charcoal below, he would be burnt to death.

The macroscopic model used at the French Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) to simulate this process is based on strong assumptions on the microscopic flow patterns. This paper describes the experimental setup designed {{for the study of}} boiling in porous media with the emphasis on various pore-scale boiling regimes. The final experimental setup is a two-dimensional porous medium made of 392 cylinders randomly placed between two ceramic plates. Each <b>heating</b> <b>cylinder</b> is a RTD probe (Resistance Temperature Detector), that can give thermal measurements in every point of the test section as well as heat generation.

The present paper examines the behaviour of a large single drop levitating over a hot surface, unsteady mass of the drop, and heat transfer. In computations, the dependence, available in the literature, for the orthogonal droplet projection on the heating surface as a function of time was employed. It was confirmed that the local value of the heat transfer coefficient is a power function of the area of the droplet surface projection. Also, a linear relationship between the flux of mass evaporated from the droplet and the droplet orthogonal projection was observed...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} measure the heat transfer from a <b>heated</b> <b>cylinder</b> in crossflow {{in an array of}} circular cylinders. All cylinders had a length-to-diameter ratio of 3. 0. Both in-line and staggered array patterns were studied. The cylinders were spaced 2. 67 diameters apart center-to-center in both the axial and transverse directions to the flow. The row containing the <b>heated</b> <b>cylinder</b> remained in a fixed position in the channel and the relative location of this row within the array was changed by adding up to five upstream rows. The working fluid was nitrogen gas at pressures from 100 to 600 kPa. The Reynolds number range based on cylinder diameter and average unobstructed channel velocity was from 5, 000 to 125, 000. Turbulence intensity profiles were measured for each case at a point one half space upstream of the row containing the <b>heated</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The basis of comparison for all the heat transfer data was the single row with the <b>heated</b> <b>cylinder.</b> For the in-line cases the addition of a single row of cylinders upstream of the row containing the <b>heated</b> <b>cylinder</b> increased the <b>heat</b> transfer by an average of 50 percent above the base case. Adding up to five more rows caused no increase or decrease in heat transfer.

Experiments have been performed with a horizontally placed <b>heated</b> <b>cylinder</b> immersed in bulk ambient conditions with water and alumina oxide/water-based dilute nanofluids as the working fluids. Volumetric concentrations of alumina nanoparticles have been varied from 0. 005 to 0. 02 %. A classical Mach-Zehnder interferometer {{has been used to}} record the line-of-sight projection data of the convective field around the <b>heated</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The strength of thermal gradients prevailing around the surface of the <b>heated</b> <b>cylinder</b> was seen to be clearly affected by the variations in the nanofluid concentration, thus indicating the plausible role of nanoparticles in disrupting the thermal boundary-layer profiles around the cylinder surface.

With a further increase in nanoparticles concentration, the Nusselt numbers showed an increasing trend, although not as significant as observed in the case of the heat transfer coefficient. Plausible mechanisms responsible for these observations have been delved upon using purely nonintrusive whole field measurements...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} a century the wake flow behind a {{cylinder}} {{has been the subject of}} many investigations. Most attention has been focussed on the first instability and the transition towards 3 D for the flow around an unheated cylinder. The wake stability for a <b>heated</b> <b>cylinder</b> has until now received very little attention compared to the forced convection case. After a review of the literature on the wake flow behind an unheated and <b>heated</b> <b>cylinder,</b> in this paper the 2 D wake behaviour and the 3 D flow transition behind a <b>heated</b> <b>cylinder</b> are described. In the analysis performed, the Reynolds number is set around ReD= 100 and the Richardson number is varied between RiD= 0 (forced convection case) and RiD= 1. 5 (mixed convection case). From the results it is seen that for a relatively small heat input (RiD 1) an early 3 D transition is observed. Mushroom-type structures appear on top of the upper vortex row. This flow transition is initiated by the occurrence of 3 D flow structures at the rear end of the cylinder...|$|R

From left to right: Individual variances {{of four of}} the data set runs show high variances around the <b>heating</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Brushing in the classification space allows for the identification of similar (green), dissimilar (red), and uncertain regions (blue and white). Together with a color mapped visualization of the ensemble domain and interactive pathline seeding, a complete analysis of transport is possible. Abstract—Sets of simulation runs based on parameter and model variation, so-called ensembles, are increasingly used to model physical behaviors whose parameter space is too large or complex to be explored automatically. Visualization {{plays a key role}} in conveying important properties in ensembles, such as the degree to which members of the ensemble agree or disagree in their output. For ensembles of time-varying vector fields, there are numerous challenges for providing an expressive comparative visualization, among which is the requirement to relate the effect of individual flow divergence to joint transport characteristics of the ensemble. Yet, techniques developed for scalar ensembles are of little use in this context, as the notion of transport induced by a vector field cannot be modeled using such tools. We develop a Lagrangian framework for the comparison of flow fields in an ensemble. Our techniques evaluate individual and joint transport variance and introduce a classification space that facilitates incorporation of these properties into a common ensemble visualization. Variances of Lagrangian neighborhoods are computed using pathline integration and Principal Components Analysis. This allows for an inclusion of uncertainty measurements into the visualization and analysis approach. Our results demonstrate the usefulness and expressiveness of the presented method on several practical examples...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of the mineral wool mat {{are determined by the}} mode of heat treatment and {{properties of}} the products. The main parameter to assess the properties of highly porous fibrous material is its resistance to the air flow, which can be estimated by the value of the hydraulic resistance. This parameter includes both the characteristics of the mineral fiber (diameter, length, density) characteristics of the system as a whole (total porosity, average density, the content of fibrous inclusions) and gas environment parameters (temperature and speed of its motion through the porous layer). Characteristics of the gaseous medium are technological factors, which influence the material during the heat treatment, and hence optimization of the process parameters. The flow of gas through the perforated wall of the hole determined by characteristics, pressurized inside a rolling pin, and the structural characteristics of the mineral geometrical cylinder and his hydraulic resistance. So, a universal criterion, which measures the mass transfer efficiency and hence the effectiveness of the heat treatment, is a hydraulic resistance cylinder. The study of the processes occurring in the mineral wool carpet, showed that its hydraulic resistance is directly proportional to the surface of fibers per unit bed volume and inversely proportional to the third degree of porosity of the layer. Researches have shown that increasing the degree of perforation increases the uneven distribution. However, if total power increases 1. 87 times, because the perforation through the inlet portion perforation of rolling pin was disclosure, substantially uniform distribution was achieved. The investigations led to the following conclusions: the specific surface layer has a linear dependence on its average density; hydraulic resistance of the layer will be greater, when the amount of beads and fibers diameter is smaller. The obtained exact dependence allows calculating the hydraulic resistance to the flow of gas in the cylinder mineral wool. This allows taking into account the parameters of a rolling pin and the intensity of its expiration coolant, optimize its heat treatment parameters, as well as to assess patterns to filter of vapor during operation in the <b>heating</b> <b>cylinder...</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented for the steady, two-dimensional, free convection around line sources of <b>heat</b> and <b>heated</b> <b>cylinders</b> in unbounded saturated porous media. It is extended to account {{also for the}} effects of forced convection. The study is based on the Boussinesq equations, with the velocities calculated using Darcy's law. The analysis begins with the non-dimensional formulation and numerical solution of the problem of pure free convection around a line source of heat. When this {{analysis is}} extended to include the effects of forced convection, two parameters appear in the non-dimensional formulation: the non-dimensional value, V/sub infin/, of the free-stream velocity and its angle gamma of inclination with respect to the vertical. We first describe the asymptotic form of the solution for large and small values of the distance to the source. The far-field description, which is also applicable to the flow around <b>heated</b> <b>cylinders,</b> is needed to facilitate the numerical solution of the problem. It includes a thermal wake, aligned with the free stream, and an outer irrotational flow with a sink and a vortex at the line source. The temperature distribution near the source involves a constant A/sub 0 /(V/sub infin/, gamma), to be calculated with the numerical solution of the complete problem, which is used in the evaluation of the heat transfer from <b>heated</b> <b>cylinders</b> when the Rayleigh and Peclet numbers are small compared with unity. In this case we find an inner region where heat conduction is dominant, and an outer region where the cylinder appears as a line source of heat.
