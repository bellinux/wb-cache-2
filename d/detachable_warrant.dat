40|$|The {{case for}} {{accounting}} separately for the debt and equity {{features of a}} convertible bond is based on two main assumptions: convertible debt can be decomposed into two, or more, fundamental financial instruments, and a convertible bond has the same economic substance as a bond with a <b>detachable</b> <b>warrant.</b> These assumptions are re-examined in this paper where it is shown that it is generally not possible to decompose a convertible bond into fundamental financial instruments, nor {{is it possible to}} form a package of a bond and a <b>detachable</b> <b>warrant</b> that replicates the character of the convertible bond. <br/...|$|E

Those transactions are commonly effected through the sale of either debt with detachable "warrants" that can be exchanged for the stock investment or debt without <b>detachable</b> <b>warrants</b> (the debt itself must be exchanged for the stock investmentâ€”referred to as "exchangeable " debentures). Those debt issues differ from traditional warrants or convertible instruments because the traditional instruments involve exchanges for the equity securities of the issuer. The issues are: 1. Whether the warrant amount should be amortized over its term, or {{whether it should be}} eliminated by a credit to income only when the warrant is exercised or expired 2.
