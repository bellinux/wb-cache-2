25|$|The {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay or ELISA is {{a diagnostic}} method for quantitatively or semi-quantitatively determining protein concentrations from blood plasma, serum or cell/tissue extracts in a multi-well plate format (usually 96-wells per plate). Broadly, proteins in solution are adsorbed to <b>ELISA</b> <b>plates.</b> Antibodies specific for the protein of interest are used to probe the plate. Background is minimised by optimising blocking and washing methods (as for IHC), and specificity is ensured via the presence {{of positive and negative}} controls.

5000|$|Of note, ELISA {{can perform}} {{other forms of}} ligand binding assays instead of {{strictly}} [...] "immuno" [...] assays, though the name carried the original [...] "immuno" [...] because of the common use and history of development of this method. The technique essentially requires any ligating reagent that can be immobilized on the solid phase along with a detection reagent that will bind specifically and use an enzyme to generate a signal that can be properly quantified. In between the washes, only the ligand and its specific binding counterparts remain specifically bound or [...] "immunosorbed" [...] by antigen-antibody interactions to the solid phase, while the nonspecific or unbound components are washed away. Unlike other spectrophotometric wet lab assay formats where the same reaction well (e.g. a cuvette) can be reused after washing, the <b>ELISA</b> <b>plates</b> have the reaction products immunosorbed on the solid phase {{which is part of}} the plate, and so are not easily reusable.|$|E
40|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is {{a popular}} {{technique}} for quantifiable detection of specific antibodies in warm-blooded animals, {{but it has not}} been accepted for detection of fish antibodies because of its low reproducibility, which {{is due in part to}} high background optical density (OD) measurements. In the present study, we report that the high background of a fish antibody- detection ELISA resulted from non-specific adsorption of fish immunoglobulin M (IgM) to blocking reagents on the <b>ELISA</b> <b>plate</b> wells. Four fish sera (from rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, masu salmon O. masou, Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus and koi Cyprinus carpio) were poured into <b>ELISA</b> <b>plate</b> wells pre-blocked with several blocking reagents (skim milk, soybean milk, bovine serum albumin, fetal bovine serum, gelatin and Roche BlockingReagent®) and then washed out in order to measure the remaining fish IgM on the <b>ELISA</b> <b>plate</b> wells. Significant amounts of fish IgMs (OD absorbance at 492 nm: 0. 3 to 1. 1) remained on the <b>ELISA</b> <b>plate</b> wells with no antigenic protein except blocking reagents.

40|$|Antibodies against {{hydrophobic}} antigens {{are common}} in several autoimmune diseases. However, detection of such antibodies by standard immune-assays, such as ELISA, is problematic, {{in part because of}} the problems with coating hydrophobic molecules onto polystyrene multi-well plates. We describe a novel method of stably associating hydrophobic antigens to <b>ELISA</b> <b>plates.</b> By mixing the antigen with a hydrophobic molecule containing a hydrophilic anchor, we generate mixed lipid aggregates that can attach to <b>ELISA</b> <b>plates,</b> and are resistant to detergent wash. Using the ganglioside GM- 1 and phosphatidylethanolamine conjugated to the hapten DNP (dinitrophenyl) as model antigens, we show that hydrophobic antigens incorporated into mixed lipid aggregates expose their antigenic determinants in a correct configuration. The detection limit of both GM- 1 and DNP-PE was considerably improved compared to when these antigens were coated on <b>ELISA</b> <b>plates</b> using organic solvents. Furthermore GM- 1 incorporated into mixed lipid aggregates can be detected by specific antibodies in patient serum. The method of incorporating hydrophobic antigens into mixed lipid aggregates for stable association to <b>ELISA</b> <b>plates</b> can presumably be applied to a vast array of hydrophobic antigens, and may well be developed into a large scale screening system for serum reactivity towards different hydrophobic antigens...|$|E

Results of in vitro antitrypanosomal activity varied from immobilization, reduction and to the killing of trypanosomes in corresponding <b>ELISA</b> <b>plate</b> wells.

Their nanoscale size and high density of functional groups on their peripheries allow them to be used for various biomedical applications. This work exploits dendrimers as drug delivery vehicles and a versatile platform for capturing biomarkers with improved sensitivity and specificity. Hydroxyl terminated poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (PAMAM-OH) was modified with a linker having amine group at the end and conjugated to two drugs, erythromycin (EM) and allopregnanonolne, respectively and evaluated in vitro. Both drugs were provided with a linker having carboxylic group required for conjugation reaction with dendrimer. The release rate of the drugs from the conjugates in PBS buffers at pH 7. 4 for EM and pH 2. 1 for allopregnanolone were evaluated by reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) analysis. EM released quite fast, about 90 % of the drug was released within 10 hours and completed within 20 hours, while allopregnanolone released in slower manner, about 90 % of the drug was released within 9 days. Dendrimer-EM conjugate was not cytotoxic and was significantly efficacious in inhibiting the nitrite production compared to free drug. The inhibition of bacterial growth by dendrimer-EM conjugate was comparable to free EM. Combined with the intinsinic properties of dendrimers, these nanodevices could lead to improved in vivo efficacy. PAMAM-OH was successfully used for the development of a solid phase bio-sensing platform. The <b>ELISA</b> <b>plate</b> was modified first with polyethylene-glycol (PEG) and then PAMAM-OH was immobilized.

The epitope becomes slightly altered by amino acid substitutions in the ectodomain and inactivation of virions by various treatments. Neutralizing anti-VP- 3 P antibodies (Abs) to the epitope interact with the synthetic peptides only if they possess a certain conformation. When the peptides were immobilized on <b>ELISA</b> <b>plates,</b> neutralizing mAbs elicited to inactivated LDV and neutralizing Abs from infected mice bound best to the peptides that consisted of the full-length, 30 -amino-acid-long ectodomain. The Abs bound poorly, if at all, to most of the shorter peptides when immobilized, whether truncated at the N- or C-end, but when in solution the same peptides strongly inhibited the binding of the Abs to immobilized full-length peptides.
