5|$|Current {{official}} transit {{maps of the}} New York City Subway {{are based}} on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not geographically accurate due to the complexity of the system (i.e. Manhattan being the smallest borough, but <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> services), but they do show major city streets as an aid to navigation. The newest edition took effect on June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller. Earlier diagrams of the subway (the first being produced in 1958), while being more aesthetically pleasing, had the perception of being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.|$|E

5|$|Given Alaska's limited {{road and}} rail infrastructure, the {{territorial}} government saw {{the advantages of}} aerial transport. In 1925, the territorial legislature authorized the spending of up to $40,000 per year on airfield construction. Between that year and 1927, more than 20 airfields were built. By 1930, Alaska had more than 100. In Fairbanks, airplanes flew from a field that doubled as a baseball diamond until 1931, when the city bought the field, installed infrastructure, and named it Weeks Field. By the late 1930s, {{there were more than}} four dozen airplanes in the town of about 3,000 people, giving Fairbanks the reputation of <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> airplanes per capita in the world.

5|$|However, {{the game}} often {{considered}} the first true survival horror, due to <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> influence on Resident Evil, was the 1989 release Sweet Home, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It {{was created by}} Tokuro Fujiwara, who would later go on to create Resident Evil. Sweet Homes gameplay focused on solving a variety of puzzles using items stored in a limited inventory, while battling or escaping from horrifying creatures, {{which could lead to}} permanent death for any of the characters, thus creating tension and an emphasis on survival. It was also the first attempt at creating a scary and frightening storyline within a game, mainly told through scattered diary entries left behind fifty years before the events of the game. Developed by Capcom, the game would become the main inspiration behind their later release Resident Evil. Its horrific imagery prevented its release in the Western world, though its influence was felt through Resident Evil, which was originally intended to be a remake of the game. Some consider Sweet Home to be the first true survival horror game.|$|E
