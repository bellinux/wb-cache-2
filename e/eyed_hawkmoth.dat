25|$|A deimatic {{displays}} is {{a pattern}} of threatening or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, used to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. For example, some moths look threatening while at rest by displaying a sinister lurking face, {{such as those of}} genus Speiredonia, or the more aggressive face of a snake poised to attack, such as many species of genus Spirama. Adult Atlas moths of the genera Attacus and Rothschildia also display snake heads.

500|$|The {{caterpillar}} of the Luna moth, as {{discovered by}} Thayer, is in Cott's phrase [...] "countershaded {{in relation to}} [...] attitude", i.e. shaded with a light back grading to a dark belly, as also is the Nile catfish, Synodontis batensoda for the same reason: these animals (and other caterpillars including Automeris io and the <b>eyed</b> <b>hawkmoth,</b> Smerinthus ocellatus) habitually live 'upside down' with the belly uppermost. Similarly in the sea slug Glaucus atlanticus, the reverse countershading is associated with inverted habits. These animals are thus employing countershading in the usual way for camouflage.|$|E

5000|$|Smerinthus planus (Oriental <b>eyed</b> <b>hawkmoth)</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Sphingidae. It was {{described}} by Walker in 1856. It is found from northern Xinjiang across northern China, Mongolia and south-eastern Siberia to the Russian Far East and Japan, and then south through Korea and Taiwan to Hainan, Yunnan and eastern Tibet.|$|E

It is a montane species found from the Taibai Shan area, western Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi, China eastwards along the Qinling to southern Shanxi and then north to just west of Beijing. It has also been recorded from the Miaofeng Mountains near Beijing and the Wuling Mountains in Hunan.|$|E

40|$|Extensive field {{surveys in}} Lancashire and Merseyside {{have shown that}} for both Smerinthus ocellata (the <b>eyed</b> <b>hawkmoth)</b> and Laothoe populi (the poplar hawkmoth) there is a {{correlation}} between larval and foodplant coloration. For L. populi, experiments have shown that foodplant determines the colour of full grown caterpillars. Siblings reared on Salix fragilis L. (which has green leaves) became yellow-green, intermediate-green or dull-green whereas those reared on Populus alba L. became either white or green. Further experiments have shown that reflected light intensity may be the vital cue which determines whether a caterpillar becomes white or green. Thus for this species. the polymorphism is environmentally rather than genetically determined. However, the genetic background appears to have some effect on the proportion of dull-green and intermediate-green morphs in broods. For S. ocellata, both laboratory and field experiments {{have shown that the}} coloration of caterpillars is also determined by some environmental factors related to light. There is no simple genetic or nutritional control of larval colour in this species. Pigment extraction and analysis have shown that the proportions of different carotenoids in the main foodplants are very similar, as are the chlorophyll a to b ratios and carotenoid to chlorophyll ratios. The principal carotenoid in the food of both species of caterpillar, lutein, is sequestered by the insects in the integument and contributes to the animal's coloration. Cis-lutein is also present in small quantities in the integuments of both L. populi and S. ocellata caterpillars. Yellow-green L. populi larvae contain more lutein in the integument than dull-green morphs and in white caterpillars this carotenoid is barely detectable. Field predation experiments indicated that white caterpillars of L. populi are at a selective advantage compared with yellow-green morphs on the white undersurface of P. alba leaves. However, both white and green morphs suffered similar predation on S. fragilis bushes...|$|E
