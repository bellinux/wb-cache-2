40|$|It is {{well known}} that planar self-complementary {{structures}} have a constant input impedance and hence they are good candidates for ultra-wideband antennas. However, introduction of a ground plane breaks the symmetry and destroys the broadband property. In this paper, it is shown that stacking of <b>dielectric</b> <b>slabs</b> above the antenna elements can reduce the degrading eject of the ground plane. The <b>dielectric</b> <b>slabs</b> act as filters adding loops {{in the center of the}} Smith chart.

40|$|Here, {{we report}} on the {{transmissivity}} of electromagnetic waves through a stack of monolayer graphene sheets separated by <b>dielectric</b> <b>slabs</b> at low-terahertz frequencies. It is observed that the multilayer structure possesses band-gap properties and supports a series of bandpass and band-stop regions, similar to the cases of stacked metallic meshes separated by <b>dielectric</b> <b>slabs</b> at microwave/THz frequencies and a metal-dielectric stack at optical frequencies. The transmission resonances in the bandpass region are identified as coupled Fabry-Pérot resonances associated with the individual cavities of <b>dielectric</b> <b>slabs</b> loaded with graphene sheets. It is also noticed that these resonances lie within a certain characteristic frequency band, independent of the number of layers in the graphene-dielectric stack. The study is carried out using a simple analytical transfer-matrix approach or, equivalently, a circuit-theory model, resulting in the exact solution for the multiple dielectric/graphene sheet surface-conductivity model. Also, an independent verification of the observed phenomena is obtained with commercial numerical simulations.

5000|$|Practical rectangular-geometry {{optical waveguides}} are most easily {{understood}} as variants of a theoretical <b>dielectric</b> <b>slab</b> waveguide, also called a planar waveguide.

50|$|Imageline, also {{image line}} or image guide, is a planar form of <b>dielectric</b> <b>slab</b> waveguide. It {{consists}} of a strip of dielectric, often alumina, on a metal sheet. In this format, there is no dielectric substrate extending in all horizontal directions, only the dielectric line. It is so called because the ground plane acts as a mirror resulting in a line that is equivalent to a <b>dielectric</b> <b>slab</b> without the ground plane of twice the height. It shows promise for use at the higher microwave frequencies, around 100 GHz, {{but it is still}} largely experimental. For instance Q factors in the thousands are theoretically possible but radiation from bends and losses in the dielectric-metal adhesive severely detract from this figure.

As already said, in NRD waveguide TM or (m≠0) TE modes with {{reference to}} the z direction cannot exist, because they cannot satisfy the conditions imposed by the presence of the <b>dielectric</b> <b>slab.</b> Yet, it is known that a propagation mode inside a guiding structure can be expressed as a superposition of a TM field and a TE field with reference to z.|$|E
5000|$|The non-radiative {{dielectric}} (NRD) waveguide [...] {{has been}} introduced by Yoneyama in 1981. In Fig. 1 the cross section of NRD guide is shown: it consists of a dielectric rectangular slab of height a and width b, which is placed between two metallic parallel plates of suitable width. The structure is practically {{the same as the}} H waveguide, proposed by Tischer in 1953. Due to the <b>dielectric</b> <b>slab,</b> the electromagnetic field is confined {{in the vicinity of the}} dielectric region, whereas in the outside region, for suitable frequencies, the electromagnetic field decays exponentially. Therefore, if the metallic plates are sufficiently extended, the field is practically negligible at the end of the plates and therefore the situation does not greatly differ from the ideal case in which the plates are infinitely extended. The polarization of the electric field in the required mode is mainly parallel to the conductive walls. As it is known, if the electric field is parallel to the walls, the conduction losses decrease in the metallic walls at the increasing frequency, whereas, if the field is perpendicular to the walls, losses increase at the increasing frequency. Since the NRD waveguide has been deviced for its implementation at millimeter waves, the selected polarization minimizes the ohmic losses in the metallic walls.|$|E
5000|$|The {{choice of}} a little spacing between the {{metallic}} plates has as a fundamental consequence that the required mode results below cut-off in the outside air-regions. In this way, any discontinuity, as a bend or a junction, is purely reactive. This permits radiation and interference to be minimized (hence the name of non-radiative guide); this fact is of vital importance in integrated circuit applications. Instead, {{in the case of}} the H waveguide, the above-mentioned discontinuities cause radiation and interference phenomena, as the desired mode, being above cutoff, can propagate towards the outside. In any case, it is important to notice that, if these discontinuities modify the symmetry of the structure with reference to the median horizontal plane, there is anyway radiation in the form of TEM mode in the parallel metallic plate guide and this mode results above cutoff, the distance between the plates may be no matter short. This aspect must always be considered in the design of the various components and junctions, and at the same time much attention has to be paid to the adherence of the <b>dielectric</b> <b>slab</b> to the metallic walls, because it is possible that the above-mentioned phenomena of losses are generated. This occurs when in general any asymmetry in the cross section transforms a confined mode into a [...] "leaky" [...] mode.|$|E

Experimental results have demonstrated pronounced cloaking effect in a very broad band from 8 GHz to 18 GHz (whole X and Ku band) due to the low loss, non-dispersive feature of the multilayer dielectric structure.

The <b>dielectric</b> <b>slab</b> is a second FR 4 substrate while the metamaterial (MTM) is the 7 × 17 periodic structure of planar cycloid dipoles (PCD).

40|$|We {{theoretically}} and numerically {{investigate the}} capability of disordered media to enhance the optical path length in <b>dielectric</b> <b>slabs</b> and augment their light absorption efficiency due to scattering. We first perform a series of Monte Carlo simulations of random walks to determine the path length distribution in weakly to strongly (single to multiple) scattering, non-absorbing <b>dielectric</b> <b>slabs</b> under normally incident light and derive analytical expressions for the path length enhancement in these two limits. Quite interestingly, while multiple scattering is expected to produce long optical paths, we find that media containing a vanishingly small amount of scatterers can still provide high path length enhancements due to the very long trajectories sustained by total internal reflection at the slab interfaces. The path length distributions are then {{used to calculate the}} light absorption efficiency of media with varying absorption coefficients. We find that maximum absorption enhancement is obtained at an optimal scattering strength, in-between the single-scattering and the diffusive (strong multiple-scattering) regimes. This study can guide experimentalists towards more efficient and potentially low-cost solutions in photovoltaic technologies...|$|R
40|$|We {{compute the}} {{non-contact}} friction force induced between two isotropic planar <b>dielectric</b> <b>slabs</b> which obey a plasma model dielectric function using scalar electromagnetism.

Strong constraints on the integration parameters which define the friction force are derived and subsequently used {{for a variety of}} numerical computations. In the limit of large dielectric separations, a saddle point approximation is used to show that the dielectric function is approximately constant in this limit. In the limit of small dielectric separations, a distinct set of integer power laws unique to the plasma model are found. These are then shown to correspond to an elastic limit for the friction force. Finally, these power laws yield a natural maximization condition for the friction which provides an interesting contrast to the behaviors observed in friction computations involving <b>dielectric</b> <b>slabs</b> with constant <b>dielectric</b> functions. by Michael O.
