40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a concept and an implementation based {{on it for}} the distribution of multimedia data on the Internet. The fulfillment of individual requirements of <b>end</b> <b>applications</b> and a high scaling capability are emphasized. This KISS 1 - Concept goes on this requirements of <b>end</b> <b>applications</b> (QoS). Thereby functions like transcoding of data formats and adaptation of different Quality of Service (e. g. data rate) are shifted into the network. In the following a protocol suitable for these purposes and a point of network access are described. Points of access are responsible for finding so-called service agents. These could provide services like e. g. transcoding or error correction. Neither server nor <b>end</b> <b>applications</b> {{are involved in the}} organization within the network.

It is therefore, believed that the combination of IntServ at the edge and DiffServ at the core will be able to provide QoS guarantees to <b>end</b> <b>applications...</b>|$|R
40|$|One of {{the design}} {{principles}} of the Internet is that the network is made more flexible, and therefore useful, by placing functionality in <b>end</b> <b>applications</b> rather than in network infrastructure. Network gateways that violate this principle are considered harmful. This paper demonstrates that such upper-level gateways exist because of realm-specific performance, security, and protocol needs of certain portions of the Internet. Placing this functionality in end hosts is, conversely, harmful to the flexibility of using the Internet to link disparate networks. Requirements are developed for a protocol to allow end-hosts and gateways to negotiate the functionality of these gateways {{in terms of the}} needs of both <b>end</b> <b>applications</b> and network realms. 1 End-to-End Arguments In [28], arguments are made for placing functionality close to the applications that use that functionality.

High-level programming languages like RDML, require less hand-crafting of code (a lower volume of coding) then traditional programming languages. They are therefore often referred to as [...] "low-code" [...] development platforms. Development, maintenance and debugging of mobile, web and cloud applications is all in the single RDML language, which then generates the underlying code required for the front end and back <b>end</b> <b>application</b> components. This negates the need for developers to learn the multiple languages typically associated with such development.|$|E

50|$|Tanning is {{the process}} that {{converts}} the protein of the raw hide or skin into a stable material which will not putrefy and is suitable {{for a wide variety}} of end applications. The principal difference between raw hides and tanned hides is that raw hides dry out to form a hard inflexible material that can putrefy when re-wetted (wetted back), while tanned material dries out to a flexible form that does not become putrid when wetted back. A large number of different tanning methods and materials can be used; the choice is ultimately dependent on the <b>end</b> <b>application</b> of the leather. The most commonly used tanning material is chromium, which leaves the leather, once tanned, a pale blue colour (due to the chromium), this product is commonly called “wet blue”.|$|E
50|$|Many tanning {{methods and}} {{materials}} exist. The choice ultimately {{depends on the}} <b>end</b> <b>application</b> for the leather. The most common tanning material is chromium, which leaves the tanned leather a pale blue color (due to the chromium). This product is commonly called wet blue. The hides, when finished pickling, are typically between pH 2.8 and 3.2. At this point, tannery workers load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a float that contains the tanning liquor. The hides soak while the drum slowly rotates about its axis, and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full thickness of the hide. Workers periodically cut a cross-section of a hide and observe the degree of penetration. Once the process achieves even penetration, workers slowly raise the float's pH in a process called basification, which fixes the tanning material to the leather—and the more tanning material fixed, the higher the leather's hydrothermal stability and shrinkage temperature resistance. Chrome-tanned leather pH is typically between pH 3.8 and 4.2.|$|E
40|$|Business-to-business (B 2 B) {{integration}} only succeeds if {{the messages}} {{sent by the}} cooperating enterprises comply to a business enterprise ontology (BEO). This ensures that the cooperating enterprises have a common understanding of the message exchanged. However, enterprise internal back <b>end</b> <b>application</b> systems follow their own BEO. This requires a transformation between the exchanged messages and the back <b>end</b> <b>application</b> representation. Consequently, throughout the whole B 2 B integration process, several transformations between BEOs have to take place. This paper will argue for a meta business enterprise ontology (MBEO) that makes sure that the transformations between BEOs preserve the semantics of the messages. Only a MBEO can guarantee that message transformation is semantics preserving. And this is an absolute requirement for successful B 2 B integration...|$|E
