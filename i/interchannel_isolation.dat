40|$|This {{amplifier}} {{was designed}} {{for use in a}} large array of proportional wire chambers with charge division readout and for cathode readout of proportional chambers. The single stage high gain (104) amplifier with FET input has low component count, low cost, and a high packing density of 32 channels per double-sided P. C. board. Edge connectors are used for input, output, power and calibration signals. The on-board calibration system drives two independent groups of amplifiers through a range which is proportional to a distributed DC level over 3 orders of magnitude. The input and output signals are differentially driven for optimum noise rejection and <b>interchannel</b> <b>isolation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Light-weight antenna arrays require {{utilizing}} the same antenna aperture to provide multiple functions (e. g., communications and radar) in separate frequency bands. In this paper, {{we present a}} novel antenna element design for a dual-band array, comprising interleaved printed dipoles spaced to avoid grating lobes in each band. The folded dipoles {{are designed to be}} resonant at octave-separated frequency bands (1 and 2 GHz), and inkjet-printed on photographic paper. Each dipole is gap-fed by voltage induced electromagnetically from a microstrip line {{on the other side of}} the substrate. This nested element configuration shows excellent corroboration between simulated and measured data, with 10 -dB return loss bandwidth of at least 5 % for each band and <b>interchannel</b> <b>isolation</b> better than 15 dB. The measured element gain is 5. 3 to 7 dBi in the two bands, with cross-polarization less than 25 dBi. A large array containing 39 printed dipoles has been fabricatedonpaper,witheachdipoleindividually fed to facilitate independent beam control. Measurements on the array reveal broadside gain of 12 to 17 dBi in each band with low cross-polarization.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} instrumentation {{with which}} to measure the abundance of neutral hydrogen gas in the Universe. Measuring where the Universe’s hydrogen is, and tracing how its distribution evolves with time, holds {{the key to understanding}} how galaxies evolve, the nature of dark energy, and how the first cosmic structures formed. In particular, this thesis looks at instrumentation for 21 -cm intensity mapping telescopes. In 21 -cm intensity mapping, the collective emission of many galaxies is measured, without individual detections. This technique promises to allow detection of the baryonic acoustic oscillation peaks in the power spectrum of the Universe’s matter distribution. Such a detection would increase constraints on cosmological parameters. There are two main approaches to designing a 21 -cm intensity mapping instruments: using a filled aperture instrument such as a single-dish telescope, or using a sparse aperture instrument such as an interferometric array of dipoles. This thesis investigates analogue components for a sparse aperture instrument operating at 1. 0 - 1. 5 GHz. As part of this work, a 16 -element sparse aperture array was designed and constructed. To test the array’s performance, field testing was conducted; the results of which are presented here. In addition to this, I have designed a new digital spectrometer for redshifted hydrogen line science, named HISPEC. A copy of this spectrometer has been installed on the Parkes 64 m telescope, as a digital signal processor for the 21 -cm multibeam receiver. HISPEC has increased instantaneous bandwidth, higher <b>interchannel</b> <b>isolation,</b> and improved quantization efficiency as compared to the existing backend, MBCORR. The HISPEC equipped multibeam receiver is an ideal instrument for 21 -cm intensity mapping at redshifts z This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{instrumentation}} for a frequency-domain (FD) near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) {{device and}} for multimodal brain measurements was implemented. Different techniques {{were applied to}} human and newborn lamb brain studies. A method to detect light leakage in NIRS measurements was developed. The FD instrument, developed at the Helsinki University of Technology was extended, by implementing 16 pseudo-differential preamplifiers for the analog-to-digital converters with a low noise and excellent <b>interchannel</b> <b>isolation.</b> An instrumentation for a digital signal-processor based lock-in amplifier was also developed. Methods for {{increasing the number of}} wavelengths and source positions in the imaging instrument were studied. A second-generation source system with a fast fiber-optic switch and four high-power laser diodes with a low noise temperature-stabilizing electronics was implemented. The imaging device was placed into a cabinet to enable its portability. New detection and source fiber terminals were developed for multimodal brain studies. The different versions of the imaging instrument were applied to four human brain measurements. In a breath-holding and hyperventilation study, the effects of source-detector distance (SDD) and measurement wavelength on the contrast of NIRS responses and the frequency content of signals were studied. Hemodynamic changes in the human brain related to the changes in sleep stages were detected. The multimodal NIRS and electroencephalography measurement setup was implemented and used to study the effects of baseline blood flow changes on the visually evoked hemodynamic and neuronal responses. The feasibility of NIRS as a part of multimodal monitoring setup to detect cerebral hemodynamic changes induced by iloprost and nitric oxide in the preterm lamb brain was also demonstrated. The linearity of the FD measurement parameters as a function of SDD on the human forehead was studied. The regression of phase measurement was observed to be sensitive to light leakage from source to detectors, much more than the regression of modulation amplitude or average intensity measurement. Utilizing this observation, a method to detect light leakage based on the pathlength measurement was developed. The contrast and depth sensitivity of NIRS signals were shown to decrease in measurements where light leakage occurs...|$|E
