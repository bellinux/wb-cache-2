The integrated weapon sight programs the airburst warheads after the laser rangefinder sights a target when the launcher is selected (the sight automatically provides aiming points for either bullets or grenades when their firing modes are selected). Point detonation explodes the shell on impact with a target and point detonation-delay lets the warhead penetrate a target before exploding; penetration ability is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|A cake firework, {{also known}} as a {{multiple}} tube device is a firework comprising a series of Roman candles, small aerial shells, or a combination of both, connected together by a high-speed fuse.

Typically a cake will resemble from the outside a simple cube or other rectangular covered shape; after firing, a large number of cardboard tubes (the candles) will be visible {{in the top of the}} firework (the paper cover having been blown off by the discharging stars). In a traditional cake, all the candles point upwards; a variant is called the fan or angle cake.|$|R

50|$|Fireworks have {{remained}} popular in today's age {{due to the}} spectacle of colors and sounds they are so renowned for. The component of a rocket that produces these stars, reports ("bangs"), and colors is typically located just below the nosecone section of a rocket. After the rocket engine has consumed all of its fuel an <b>internal</b> <b>fuse</b> is lit that delays {{the release of the}} stars, or other effect. This delay allows for coasting time where the rocket continues its ascent. As gravity will eventually pull the firework back to earth, it slows and eventually reaches an apex (highest point: where velocity of the rocket is zero) and begins its descent. The delay usually lasts just before this apex, at an optimum velocity, where a small explosion shoots the firework's stars in desired directions and thus producing a brilliant effect. The colors, reports, flashes, and, stars are analogous to flavor one adds with spices (chemicals with special pyrotechnic properties) to a soup of otherwise bland gunpowder.|$|E

50|$|In this example, the {{marginal}} {{reliability of the}} connector choice was deemed to be acceptable by the equipment designer, since the power adapter supplies low voltage that does not pose an electric shock hazard. The potential fire hazard from accidental short-circuiting is addressed by the <b>internal</b> safety <b>fuse,</b> although this requires that a failed power adapter must be completely replaced. In a different design, if the power adapter were intended to supply a voltage sufficient to cause electrical shock, the semi-exposed center contact of the female plug would be considered unacceptably hazardous, requiring a different choice of power connector.|$|R

Although the plug is female, with a partially recessed center contact, it is still possible for casual accidental contact with a metallic object to short-circuit the power source. Depending on the design of the power adapter, it may react to a short circuit by shutting down temporarily, or instead by blowing out an <b>internal</b> safety <b>fuse.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we report}} latest {{developments}} in wafer-level micro-glassblowing paradigm for fabrication of highly symmetric, high Q-factor fused silica wineglass gyroscopes.

50|$|These {{features}} are required because the negative electrode produces heat during use, while the positive electrode may produce oxygen. However, these additional devices occupy space inside the cells, add points of failure, and may irreversibly disable the cell when activated. Further, these features increase costs compared to {{nickel metal hydride}} batteries, which require only a hydrogen/oxygen recombination device and a back-up pressure valve. Contaminants inside the cells can defeat these safety devices. Also, these features can not be applied {{to all kinds of}} cells, e.g. prismatic high current cells cannot be equipped with a vent or thermal interrupt.

40|$|Abstract — A 0. 9 to 1. 5 kW, 2. 45 GHz {{atmospheric}} pressure air microwave plasma torch has been operated efficiently {{with less than}} 1 % reflected power. The plasma is sustained in a 28 mm <b>internal</b> diameter <b>fused</b> quartz tube which penetrates perpendicularly through the wide walls of a tapered and shorted WR- 284 (72 x 17 mm cross-section) waveguide. A study {{has been made of}} the effects of power and airflow on the electronic excitation temperature, Texc. Abel inversion of radial profile chord averaged Fe I emission lines in the 370 to 377 nm range have been used to obtain localized profile measurements of Texc inside the waveguide excitation region. In general, temperature profiles peak on axis with no evidence of a skin effect in the large diameter (10 mm FWHM emission intensity) plasmas. A maximum central Texc of 6550 K ± 350 K is observed at an airflow rate of 28 lpm. When maintaining a constant flow rate of 14 lpm, a 55 % increase in microwave power from 0. 9 to 1. 4 kW causes a ~ 100 % increase in plasma volume without any noticeable effect on the central Texc value. At a constant microwave power of 1. 4 kW, an increase in total flow rate from 11 to 28 lpm decreases the volume of the plasma by ~ 25 % and increases the central Texc by ~ 13 %. The axially peaked temperature profiles are consistent with an electron density of ~ 1013 cm- 3.

40|$|Packed {{capillary}} {{liquid chromatography}} {{in combination with}} ultraviolet and mass spectrometric (MS) detection was explored as an analytical tool for drug analysis. The focus was put on column and sample preparation techniques {{as well as on}} fundamental aspects and development of chromatographic separations. Both octadecylbonded (C 18) silica and porous graphitic carbon (PGC) was used as stationary phases. Supercritical carbon dioxide was used as the packing carrier to pack silica based C 18 particles in 0. 2 mm <b>internal</b> diameter <b>fused</b> silica capillaries. A factorial design was used to examine the influence of selected factors on packing performance. The model obtained indicated that the best packing conditions would include the use of a pressure ramp, a high final pressure and a long restrictor. The retention behaviour of sulphated heparin and chondroitin disaccharides of different charge levels was studied on PGC capillary columns. It was found that the retention was strongly dependent on the choice of buffer and number of sulphate groups on the disaccharides. An increase in retention was observed when the temperature or the concentration of the organic modifier was increased. A packed capillary PGC column was also used to separate the polar drug L-DOPA and four of its metabolites in plasma. The mobile phase contained no ion-pairing agents and relatively high concentrations of organic modifier, which makes it suitable for e. g. MS detection. A method was developed to determine the free concentration of the drug tolterodine at pM-nM levels in microliter plasma volumes. Ultrafiltration was used as the sample preparation method. For the analyses, packed capillary C 18 columns in a column-switching system coupled to MS detection was used.

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} {{for personal}} sampling for inhalable aerosol hazards is constrained by issues of sampler cost and complexity; these issues have limited the adoption {{and use of}} some samplers by practicing hygienists. Thus, despite the known health effects of inhalable aerosol hazards, personal exposures are routinely assessed for {{only a small fraction}} of the at-risk workforce. To address the limitations of current technologies for inhalable aerosol sampling, a disposable inhalable aerosol sampler was developed and evaluated in the laboratory. The new sampler is designed to be less expensive and simpler to use than existing technologies. The sampler incorporates a lightweight <b>internal</b> capsule <b>fused</b> to the sampling filter. This capsule-filter assembly allows for the inclusion of particles deposited on the internal walls and inlet, thus minimizing the need to wash or wipe the interior sampling cassette when conducting gravimetric analyses. Sampling efficiency and wall losses were tested in a low-velocity wind tunnel with particles ranging from 9. 5 to 89. 5. The results were compared to the proposed low-velocity inhalability criterion as well as published data on the IOM sampler. Filter weight stability and time-to-equilibrium were evaluated as these factors affect the practicality of a design. Preliminary testing of the new sampler showed good agreement with both the IOM and the proposed low-velocity inhalability curve. The capsule and filter assemblies reached equilibrium within 25 h of manufacturing when conditioned at elevated temperatures. After reaching equilibrium, the capsule-filter assemblies were stable within 0. 01 mg.

40|$|Closed-face 37 -mm {{polystyrene}} cassettes {{are often}} used for exposure monitoring of metal particulates. Several methods have been proposed {{to account for the}} wall loss in air sampling cassettes, including rinsing, wiping, within-cassette dissolution, and an <b>internal</b> capsule <b>fused</b> to the filter that could be digested with the filter. Until internal capsules replace filters, other methods for assessing wall losses may be considered. To determine if rinsing and wiping or wiping alone is adequate to determine wall losses on cassettes, we collected 54 full-shift area air samples at a battery recycling facility. We collected six replicate samples at three locations within the facility for three consecutive days. The wall losses of three replicate cassettes from each day-location were analyzed following a rinse and two consecutive wipes. The wall losses of the other three replicates from each day-location were analyzed following two consecutive wipes only. Mixed-cellulose ester membrane filter, rinse, and wipes were analyzed separately following NIOSH Method 7303. We found an average of 29 % (range: 8 - 54 %) recovered lead from the cassette walls for all samples. We also found that rinsing prior to wiping the interior cassette walls did not substantially improve recovery of wall losses compared to wiping alone. A rinse plus one wipe recovered on average 23 % (range: 13 - 33 %) of the lead, while one wipe alone recovered on average 21 % (range: 16 - 22 %). Similarly, we determined that a second wipe did not provide substantial additional recovery of lead (average: 4 %, range: 0. 4 - 19 %) compared to the first wipe disregarding the rinse (average: 18 %, range: 4 - 39 %). We concluded that when an internal capsule is not used, wall losses of lead dust in air sampling cassettes can be adequately recovered by wiping the internal wall surfaces of the cassette with a single wipe.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the pH-dependent interaction between large unilamellar phospholipid vesicles (liposomes) and membrane vesicles derived from Bacillus subtilis, utilizing a fluorescent assay based on resonance energy transfer (RET). Efficient interaction occurs only with negatively charged liposomes, containing cardiolipin or phosphatidylserine, as revealed by the dilution of the RET probes from the liposomal bilayer into the bacterial membrane. The initial rate of fluorophore dilution increases steeply with decreasing pH. The interaction involves a process of membrane fusion, as indicated by (i) the proportional transfer of cholesteryl-[1 - 14 C]oleate, 14 C-labeled egg PC, and the RET probes from the liposomes to the bacterial vesicles, (ii) the formation of interaction products with an intermediate buoyant density, and (iii) the appearance of colloidal gold, initially encapsulated in the liposomes, in the <b>internal</b> volume of <b>fused</b> structures as revealed by thin-section electron microscopy. Treatment of B. subtilis vesicles with trypsin strongly inhibits the fusion reaction, indicating the protein dependence of the process. Vesicles derived from Streptococcus cremoris or from the inner membrane of Escherichia coli also show low pH-dependent fusion with liposomes. The fusion process described in this paper may well be of considerable importance to studies on the mechanisms of membrane fusion and to studies on the structure and function of bacterial membranes. In addition, the fusion reaction could be utilized to deliver foreign substances into bacterial protoplasts. ...|$|R
