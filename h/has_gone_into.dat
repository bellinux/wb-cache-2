5|$|A {{brain and}} a subtle ear <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> {{the making of}} this poem...celebrating the mystery of Christ's conception. Dew falling on grass, flower and spray (traditional imagery, {{deriving}} from OT texts such as Psalm 72:6) suggests ease, grace and delicacy generally (not progressive stages of insemination). The emphasis on Mary's freedom of choice, {{at the moment of}} the annunciation, is theologically strictly proper.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Jack and Liz are at a jewelry store, as Jack is searching for an engagement ring for Elisa. They shot that scene in a Cartier store in New York's Fifth Avenue, which was filmed on February 22, 2009. A scene featuring Sue LaRoche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway) as the Grim Reaper, in which Jenna is led to believe Kenneth <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> shock because of the strawberries, was cut from the airing. According to Jane Krakowski, in the DVD commentary for this episode, there were alternate scenes with Jenna letting Kenneth know about the tampering she did to Kenneth's items, his chickpea, water bottle, and harmonica.|$|E

After Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors, the group leaves to track down Isabella, who <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> labor at the police station, while the policeman on duty rushes Isabella {{to the hospital in}} her van. Along the way they discover they have all cheated death twice; {{had it not been for}} the survivors of Flight 180 they would all be dead, which explains why the survivors are dying in reverse. Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck, she is last on Death's list.|$|E

5|$|Mary's {{investigation}} {{leads her}} to Jacqueline's secret husband, Gregory Ward (Hugh Beaumont); a failed poet, Jason Hoag (Erford Gage); and a mysterious psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway). Jacqueline had been Judd's patient, seeking treatment for depression stemming from her {{membership in a}} Satanic cult called the Palladists. She was lured into joining the cult by her former co-workers. Mary enlists a private detective, Irving August (Lou Lubin), but he is stabbed to death while investigating at the La Sagesse headquarters. Judd eventually helps Mary locate Jacqueline, who <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> hiding. Gregory Ward {{falls in love with}} Mary. Jacqueline is later kidnapped by the cult members and condemned to death for revealing the cult. She would be the seventh person so condemned since the founding of the cult (hence the film's title).|$|E
5|$|Miss Rosa meets new {{prison inmate}} Piper and offers her some advice. She reveals {{that she is}} {{suffering}} from cancer and undergoing chemotherapy. Miss Rosa is told that she needs an operation to improve her chances of survival. However the DOC refuse to fund the operation and she is told {{that she needs to}} keep having chemotherapy. The outcome of which means she is likely to die. She then reminisces about her past as bank robber in which all the men she kissed during heists ended up dead. She details her life to a fellow cancer patient Yusef and they bond. He decides to help her regain the adrenaline rush felt from robbery and they steal a nurse's purse. Miss Rosa is delighted to learn that Yusef <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> remission but is sad to say goodbye. She returns to her cell and informs good friend Anita DeMarco (Lin Tucci) that she is dying before smelling the money she stole from the nurse.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

5|$|Homer applies {{for a job}} at {{the power}} plant once more, this time marching into Mr. Burns's office and telling him that he will be the perfect employee. Mr. Burns is so {{impressed}} that he hires Homer on the spot. When Homer returns to Marge's house, he discovers from Jacqueline that she <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> labor and is already at the hospital. He quickly gets there and sees Marge with Selma and an angry Patty, who starts berating him. Fed up with her disrespect, Homer lashes out at Patty and angrily tells Patty (as well {{as the rest of the}} Bouvier family) to start showing him some respect for he has a job, a piece of news that Homer promptly tells Marge before she finally gives birth to Bart. After Homer finishes telling his flashback story, he admits to Bart that he received the greatest gift a man can have the day Bart was born. At that time, Marge arrives home with the news that she is not pregnant. They are both overjoyed and high-five.|$|E
5|$|Oil spills {{present a}} {{localized}} threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other diminution of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if {{the enforcement of}} water quality standards is not upheld. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality issue in some areas, as it eliminates otter prey. This dilemma prevents, and consequently inhibits, recolonization or growth of otter populations. Recently, long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant otter populations has been discussed. Similarly, many perceived threats to otters, such as pollution and habitat alterations, have not been rigorously evaluated. Little effort <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> assessing the threat of disease to wild river otter populations, so it is poorly understood and documented. River otters may be victims of canine distemper, rabies, respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection. In addition, North American river otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia. They host numerous endoparasites, such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, the sporozoan Isopora, and acanthocephalans. Ectoparasites include ticks, sucking lice(Latagophthirus rauschi), and fleas (Oropsylla arctomys).|$|E
5|$|The doctor tells Scully that Emily {{is getting}} worse. A {{woman from the}} {{adoption}} agency arrives and wants to stop Scully from making decisions for Emily. Mulder connects {{the names of the}} women in the nursing home to recent births and finds that Dr. Calderon was treating them. Emily reacts badly to being placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Mulder finds medical records with Scully's name on them at the nursing home, along with a live fetus in a refrigerated chamber. Mulder finds Calderon entering soon after, and Detective Kresge arrives as well. Mulder and Kresge confront Calderon, who attacks Kresge. Despite Mulder's warning Kresge shoots Calderon, whose wounds cause him to spew green blood which incapacitates Kresge. Mulder quickly leaves the building to avoid being affected by the blood. Calderon morphs into Kresge, and deceives Mulder and escapes. Mulder returns to the hospital, where Emily <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> a coma. Days later Emily has died. Mulder visits Scully at the funeral chapel, telling her that Kresge is recovering and all evidence at the nursing home and Prangen is gone. The only evidence left is Emily's body, but the agents instead find sand bags in her coffin along with Scully's cross necklace, which she had previously given to Emily.|$|E

5|$|In neuroscience, a {{great deal}} of effort <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> {{investigating}} how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion. Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience. Second, and even more importantly, working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present. In computational neuroscience, Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience, and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.|$|E
