The notion that a contemporary woman must look mannish in order to be taken seriously as a seeker of power is frankly dismaying. <b>How</b> <b>has</b> our culture come to this? How is it that The Washington Post recoils from the slightest hint of cleavage on a senator? This is America, not Saudi Arabia.

I do think Americans have moved on from the power-suit mentality, which served as a bridge for a generation of women to reach boardrooms filled with men. Political campaigns that do not recognize this are making a serious misjudgment." ...|$|E
