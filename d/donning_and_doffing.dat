50|$|The {{original}} HUT {{design for}} the EMU, first used in 1980, included bellowed shoulder bearings, which allowed for variation in {{the angle of the}} shoulder bearings. This allowed for one configuration to ease donning of the suit, and a different configuration to allow maximum mobility during EVA. However, the limited life of the bellows prompted a redesign in 1990 to a fixed shoulder bearing angle and position, referred to as the Planar HUT, resulting in reduced mobility and more difficult <b>donning</b> <b>and</b> <b>doffing.</b>|$|E

40|$|Sometimes {{children}} are born with (part of) an arm missing. Next to congenital loss, children or adults can loose their arm due to an accident or illness.

50|$|The modular ABCS {{utilizes}} {{a transit}} isolator {{consisting of a}} metal frame supporting numerous items of medical equipment (heart and pulse oxygen monitors, etc.).

Only one patient—attended by one doctor and two nurses—can be accommodated in one isolator in one aircraft. The patient area is provided with continuous negative air pressure and air filtration to keep pathogens from entering the rest of the cabin.

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{problems}} also turned up, primarily related {{to the problem of}} keeping the suit in strong mechanical contact at every point on the body. Concavities or small folds in the fabric could lead to fluid pooling in the gaps; the groin area proved extremely difficult to tailor successfully. To correct this, small pads of polyurethane foam were inserted into concavities and were successful in most problem areas. The suits had to be tailored to each individual, although the same was true of all space suits of the era. The largest difficulty was donning and removing the suit. In order to effectively provide the minimum pressure of [...] necessary for human physiology, the suit had to be extremely tight-fitting, making <b>donning</b> <b>and</b> <b>doffing</b> a highly strenuous task.|$|E

The first Shuttle EVA was to occur on STS-5, but an electrical failure on the circulation fan forced the EVA to be cancelled. The first EVA of the new EMU finally occurred on STS-6 when Story Musgrave and Donald Peterson went out in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle Challenger and tested techniques to lower the launch cradle of a solid-fuel upper stage used to boost a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-A) into a geo-stationary orbit.|$|E
50|$|The WHO {{recommends}} {{the use of}} 2 pairs of gloves, with the outer pair worn over the gown. Using 2 pairs may {{reduce the risk of}} sharp injuries; however, {{there is no evidence that}} using more than the recommended will give additional protection.

When a gown (or coverall) is worn, it should continue beyond the shoe covers. According to guidelines released by the CDC in August 2015, updates were put in place to improve the PAPR doffing method to make the steps easier, and affirm the importance of cleaning the floor where doffing has been done. Additionally, a designated doffing assistant was recommended to help in this process. The order in which boot covers are removed, by these guidelines, indicates their removal after the coverall or gown.

Future anti-gravity suits (AGS) may {{be similar to the}} Shuttle era inflatable AGS or may be a mechanical compression device like the Russian Kentavr.

Furthermore, these new compression garments could be worn for several days after space flight as necessary if symptoms persisted. We conducted two studies to evaluate elastic, gradient compression garments.

30|$|The {{absolute}} trajectory and {{the area}} under the curve (AUC) for each specimen at each motion segment were generated.

Given the real time data acquisition capability of the testing system used in this study, the motion trajectory itself could be compared between different testing conditions.

40|$|Background: Over the years, {{various types}} of orthoses have been {{designed}} to assist subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI) to stand and walk. However, the functional performance of the orthoses has not been adequate, that is, patients experience stability problems, consume excessive energy during ambulation, and generally require assistance in <b>donning</b> <b>and</b> <b>doffing</b> the devices. This research is aimed at categorizing the available orthoses designed specifically for SCI patients and to compare the available orthoses according to the energy consumption, stability analysis, and gait parameters. Methods: An electronic search was done in PubMed, Embase, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases to extract data related to 1960 - 2010. The available orthoses were characterized based on the level of stabilization they provided and the source of power used. The orthoses were compared based on the stability, energy consumption, and gait performance parameters, according to the results of various studies collected from the literature review. Results: Among various orthoses designed for paraplegic subjects, the mechanical orthoses seemed to have a better performance. Moreover, <b>donning</b> <b>and</b> <b>doffing</b> of the mechanical orthosis was easier for the subjects. Conclusion: Although the HGO has better functional performance than other available orthoses, the subjects are more willing to use the RGO. The new design of orthoses must allow easy <b>donning</b> <b>and</b> <b>doffing</b> by the users, have enough stability during walking and standing, and enable the patients to change the alignment of the orthosis to suit their needs...|$|E

The main {{purpose of this article is}} to evaluate the pistoning at the prosthetic liner-socket interface during gait and assess patients' satisfaction with two different liners. Two prostheses with seal-in and lock-ing liners were fabricated for each of the 10 subjects with transtibial amputation. The Vicon motion system was used to measure the pistoning during gait. The subjects were also asked to complete a Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire. The results revealed higher pistoning inside the socket during gait with the locking liner than with the seal-in liner (p < 0. 05). The overall satisfaction with the locking liner was higher (p < 0. 05) because of the relative ease with which the patients could <b>don</b> <b>and</b> <b>doff</b> the device.

This paper introduces a new pneumatic {{suspension system}} that overcomes the drawbacks of current suspension systems in <b>donning</b> <b>and</b> <b>doffing,</b> change in volume during daily activities, and pressure distribution in the socket-stump interface. An air pneumatic suspension system (APSS) for total-contact sockets was designed and developed. Pistoning and pressure distribution in the socket-stump interface were tested for the new APSS. More than 95 % of the area between each prosthetic socket and liner was measured using a Tekscan F-Scan pressure measurement which has developed matrix-based pressure sensing systems. The variance in pressure around the stump was 8. 76 kPa. APSS exhibits less pressure concentration around the stump, improved pressure distribution, easy <b>donning</b> <b>and</b> <b>doffing,</b> adjustability to remain fitted to the socket during daily activities, and more adaptability to the changes in stump volume.
