5|$|The Australians {{were already}} {{preparing}} to produce radar sets locally. Oliphant persuaded Professor Thomas Laby to release Eric Burhop and Leslie Martin <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> on optical munitions {{to work on}} radar, and they succeeded in building a cavity magnetron in their laboratory at the University of Melbourne in May 1942. Oliphant worked with Martin {{on the process of}} moving the magnetrons for the laboratory to the production line. Over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia during the war.|$|E
5|$|After {{their work}} with Black Uhuru and that group's line-up change, Sly and Robbie pursued more {{international}} music endeavors. They branched out into cross-genre experiments with a conceptual, ensemble-oriented approach, while developing a mentorship with record producer Bill Laswell, whom they met through Blackwell and by working on Mick Jagger's 1985 album She's the Boss. In 1985, they collaborated with Laswell on their album Language Barrier, which had guest contributions from Herbie Hancock, Bob Dylan, Afrika Bambaataa, and Manu DiBango. Its recording developed from a track the duo had revisited <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> on the soundtrack to the 1983 film Never Say Never Again. The track had been done with electronic drums at Compass Point Studios, but scrapped as a rhythm track for later use.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the gold rush on the Native peoples of the region was considerable. The Tlingit and the Koyukon peoples prospered {{in the short term}} <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> as guides, packers and from selling food and {{supplies}} to the prospectors. In the longer term, however, especially the Hän people living in the Klondike region suffered from the environmental damage of the gold mining on the rivers and forests. Their population had already begun to decline after the discovery of gold along Fortymile River in the 1880s but dropped catastrophically after their move to the reserve, a result of the contaminated water supply and smallpox. The Hän found only few ways to benefit economically from the gold rush and their fishing and hunting grounds were largely destroyed; by 1904 they needed aid from the NWMP to prevent famine.|$|E

5|$|Their service {{records have}} added to their fame, ranging <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> as carrier escorts in World War II to their shore {{bombardment}} duties in North Korea, North Vietnam, and the Middle East, {{as well as their}} service in the Cold War against the expanded Soviet Navy. Their reputation combined with the stories told concerning the firepower of these battleships' 16-inch guns are such that when they were brought out of retirement in the 1980s in response to increased Soviet Naval activity—and in particular, in response to the commissioning of the s—the United States Navy was inundated with requests from former sailors pleading for a recall to active duty so they could serve aboard one of the battleships.|$|E
5|$|With the {{producer}} question settled, Schlatter set about assembling the crew for the series. Mort Lindsey {{was hired to}} conduct the show's orchestra. Gary Smith, who had designed the earlier Sinatra/Martin special, was signed as art director. Multiple Academy Award-winner Edith Head was engaged to design Garland's costumes while Ray Aghayan, who Schlatter knew <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> together with Dinah Shore, was hired to costume Garland's guests. Mel Tormé was brought on as musical arranger and to write special musical material and would also appear as a guest on the program. Choreography duties were taken by Danny Daniels. Comedian Jerry Van Dyke was engaged as a series regular.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{study by}} Kathryn Thomas and Sandra Carlson used teeth {{from the upper}} jaw of three {{individuals}} interpreted as a juvenile, a subadult, and an adult, recovered from a bone bed in the Hell Creek Formation of Corson County, South Dakota. In this study, successive teeth in columns in the edmontosaurs' dental batteries were sampled from multiple locations along each tooth using a microdrilling system. This sampling method {{takes advantage of the}} organization of hadrosaurid dental batteries to find variation in tooth isotopes over a period of time. <b>From</b> <b>their</b> <b>work,</b> it appears that edmontosaur teeth took less than about 0.65years to form, slightly faster in younger edmontosaurs. The teeth of all three individuals appeared to show variation in oxygen isotope ratios that could correspond to warm/dry and cool/wet periods; Thomas and Carlson considered the possibility that the animals were migrating instead, but favored local seasonal variations because migration would have more likely led to ratio homogenization, as many animals migrate to stay within specific temperature ranges or near particular food sources.|$|E

Kim Seung-woo has signed on to reprise his role of North Korean agent Park Cheol-young previously featured in Iris and Athena, while Kim Min-jong is set to return as defector Kim Gi-soo from Athena and Kim Yeong-cheol is to come back as the villain from the original series, Baek San. Several others, including Kang Ji-young from South Korean pop group Kara, Yoon Doo-joon of boy band B2ST, and Lee Joon from MBLAQ were all also discussed for roles, along with American actor Daniel Henney.|$|E

25|$|Overall, Rivers {{attributed}} the neuroses to both (i) the escape of painful instincts and their associated emotions from the unconscious and (ii) the mind's unsuccessful efforts to force such instincts and their emotions {{back into the}} conscious.

25|$|A novelist is {{an author}} or writer of novels, though often novelists also write in other genres of both fiction and non-fiction.

By the mid-1980s rationing of over seventy items had been eliminated; production of consumer goods had increased, and most items were in good supply.
