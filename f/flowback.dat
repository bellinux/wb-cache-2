500|$|The coin {{shortage}} did not ease during 1963. In {{spite of}} heavy production {{by the two}} mints, early 1964 saw but a trickle of <b>flowback,</b> alarming the Fed.

[...] Many of the silver ones were being taken out of circulation by people believing the price of that metal would rise.|$|E
500|$|The Mint {{began to}} strike {{the first of the}} 1965-dated clad coins, quarters, on August 23 of that year, making them the first U.S. coins to bear that date. By November 1965, with the Christmas {{shopping}} season beginning, the Fed had only 15 million of the old silver quarters in reserve. [...] That month, though, the Mint released over 230 million of the new clad quarters, and stated that an equal number would be issued every month. [...] This figure quadrupled the previous record monthly production. [...] The new dime and half dollar were released in early 1966, a time when <b>flowback</b> to the Fed increased for all denominations being struck except the half dollar. [...] That denomination failed to return to circulation, as they continued to be withdrawn. The Mint continued to strike 1964-dated silver pieces under the authority of the Coinage Act until 1966, when Secretary Fowler announced, [...] "the coin shortage is over". In July 1966, the Treasury announced that coins struck after August 1, 1966, would bear the date of minting.|$|E
40|$|Engineering {{estimates}} of methane emissions from natural gas production {{have led to}} varied projections of national emissions. This work reports direct measurements of methane emissions at 190 onshore natural gas sites in the United States (150 production sites, 27 well completion <b>flowbacks,</b> 9 well unloadings, and 4 workovers). For well completion <b>flowbacks,</b> which clear fractured wells of liquid to allow gas production, methane emissions ranged from 0. 01 Mg to 17 Mg (mean = 1. 7 Mg; 95 % confidence bounds of 0. 67 – 3. 3 Mg), compared {{with an average of}} 81 Mg per event in the 2011 EPA national emission inventory from April 2013. Emission factors for pneumatic pumps and controllers as well as equipment leaks were both comparable to and higher than estimates in the national inventory. Overall, if emission factors from this work for completion <b>flowbacks,</b> equipment leaks, and pneumatic pumps and controllers are assumed to be representative of national populations and are used to estimate national emissions, total annual emissions from these source categories are calculated to be 957 Gg of methane (with sampling and measurement uncertainties estimated at ± 200 Gg). The estimate for comparable source categories in the EPA national inventory is ∼ 1, 200 Gg. Additional measurements of unloadings and workovers are needed to produce national emission estimates for these source categories. The 957 Gg in emissions for completion <b>flowbacks,</b> pneumatics, and equipment leaks, coupled with EPA national inventory estimates for other categories, leads to an estimated 2, 300 Gg of methane emissions from natural gas production (0. 42 % of gross gas production) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{are proud}} to welcome you to the conference ‘In the Flow: People, Media, Materialities’. It is {{arranged}} by the Advanced Cultural Studies Institute of Sweden (ACSIS), a national centre for interdisciplinary and international networking in cultural research. This is the sixth biennial ACSIS conference. All the conferences have had different themes connected to various aspects of cultural research. ‘In the Flow: People, Media, Materialities’ {{is a continuation of}} the fifth conference, ‘On the Move’, which explored the ‘mobility turns’ various extensions in cultural research. This conference also emphasizes spatial, cultural and social flows, but the focus is on mediatization and how new and old media interact with bodies, institutions and various industries to produce social, cultural and material effects. We are especially proud to welcome our two keynote speakers, Anna Reading, Professor of Culture and Creative Industries at Kings College, London, and Mike Crang, Professor of Geography at Durham University, two scholars who in recent years have set out to rework the borders of, on the one hand, the cultural and the symbolical and, on the other hand, the material and the physical. The borderlands between the representational and the corporeal are explored by the plenary panel led by André Jansson, Professor of Media and Communication Studies at Karlstad University, discussing what body-monitoring technologies do to our experiences of being human. The keynotes and the plenary panel set the tone for sessions and individual papers presented by cultural researchers from many different countries. There are, for example, a number of presentations on digital technology. Similar to the plenary panel, some look at the nexus of mediatization and material embodied in everyday life actions and habits, examining the interplay between physical movement and affective engagement regarding wearable devices. Others approach the overarching theme of flows and slowdowns by discussing various aspects of understanding and tracking the circulation of images, music, texts and materialities, such as the mundane practices tied to online searches, methodologies to analyze online data, the curbing of the contemporary abundance of documents in institutions or how patents and copyrights regulate the distribution of on-screen immaterialities as well as material objects. The conference suggests that the ways in which digital media saturate contemporary everyday life have energized and renewed classic cultural studies fields, such as the study of identities, music consumption and television viewing. Theoretical redirections such as new materialism and ANT have directed attention to the agency of non-human actors such as computers in cultural processes {{at the same time as}} scholars have kept their eyes open for the everyday life agency of, for example, children and young people. Digital media are a very significant theme running through the conference. Another is the flows of objects and ideas through space as well as the effect of flows on people and places, investigating, for example, two-way flows between colonized lands and the metropole itself, <b>flowbacks</b> of labour and capital, urban transformations and the reconfiguration of resort cities. A third theme is heritage flows. A series of sessions discuss how new technologies, globalization, policies and changing classification systems set heritage values, exhibitions and institutions in motion. Additional themes such as cultural sociology, feminist culture studies and the future of gender and sexualities remind cultural researchers of the importance of keeping their eyes open for power relations, inequalities, identities and politics. We are also very pleased to present our series of spotlight sessions. Here we have invited researchers to discuss time, media history, heritage institutions, the impact of digital media on fan and celebrity cultures, and feminist culture studies. Thanks to an initiative from the master’s students on the Linköping University Programme for Culture, Society and Media Production, we have a spotlight session on education and research. The conference is supported by Linköping University’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Swedish universities which co-fund ACSIS, and the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation. We are also enormously grateful for and impressed by the unpaid efforts of all invited speakers, panellists, moderators, session organizers and paper presenters. We invite you to discover the conference’s rich and varied content, which encourages interdisciplinary exchanges as well as conversaions across empirical fields. Finally, we wish to stress that conferences are a great opportunity to meet old friends and make new ones. In addition to the discussions at the sessions, there will be plenty of time to socialize at the reception on Monday evening at the art gallery Verkstad and at the conference dinner on Tuesday night.

500|$|The banks {{accustomed}} {{themselves to}} seasonal need for coins, as for quarters and half dollars in Michigan to pay cherry pickers the traditional 75-cent rate, and to local preferences; for example, half dollars were not popular in New York, two quarters being preferred instead. [...] Beginning in late 1959, the Mint {{failed to provide}} enough coins to satisfy demand, and the Fed, through its district banks and branches, imposed rationing. By 1963, there was often rationing of all denominations, commercial banks (and their retail customers) receiving less than they needed. There were widespread shortages of some denominations during the 1962 holiday shopping season. [...] Traditionally, the heavy demand for coinage {{late in the year}} resulted in a large amount of <b>flowback</b> in the winter, but in early 1963, few coins returned to the banks, or to the Fed. [...] Officials suggested responsibility might lie with coin collectors and investors, as well as uncollected coins remaining in the nation's millions of vending machines. The Mint increased production to around-the-clock shifts at Philadelphia and Denver. A new Philadelphia Mint was authorized in 1963, though the hoped-for opening date of 1966 was soon pushed back to 1967 (it eventually opened in 1969).|$|E
2500|$|The US EPA has {{acknowledged}} that toxic, carcinogenic chemicals, i.e. benzene and ethylbenzene, {{have been used as}} gelling agents in water and chemical mixtures for high volume horizontal fracturing (HVHF). [...] Following the hydraulic fracture in HVHF, the water, chemicals, and frack fluid that return to the well's surface, called <b>flowback</b> or produced water, may contain radioactive materials, heavy metals, natural salts, and hydrocarbons which exist naturally in shale rock formations. [...] Fracking chemicals, radioactive materials, heavy metals, and salts that are removed from the HVHF well by well operators are so difficult to remove from the water they're mixed with, and would so heavily pollute the water cycle, that most of the <b>flowback</b> is either recycled into other fracking operations or injected into deep underground wells, eliminating the water that HVHF required from the hydrologic cycle.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Flowback</b> fluid {{contains}} {{high levels}} of salt and is contaminated with organic [...] "solids, heavy metals, fracking chemicals and {{naturally occurring radioactive material}} (NORM) of varying concentration and low levels of radioactive materials". The Environment Agency strategy for management of NORM-contaminated <b>flowback</b> fluid, after treatment, includes its preferred re-use by re-injection during hydraulic fracturing and its disposal, with caveats, via water treatment sites.|$|E
50|$|There are six {{stages in}} {{hydraulic}} fracturing: Perforation; Isolation: Stimulation; Flushing; Multi-stage perforation, and; <b>Flowback.</b>|$|E
5000|$|What are the {{possible}} impacts of releases of <b>flowback</b> and produced water on drinking water resources? ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 2014, [...] "applications {{for permits}} to frack" [...] were {{withdrawn}} by Cuadrilla after arrangements for treatment {{and disposal of}} NORM-contaminated <b>flowback</b> fluid were considered inadequate by the Environment Agency. Technologies are developing methods of removing salt and radioactive materials, allowing safe disposal of <b>flowback</b> fluid under Environment Agency licence. Research in the US also indicates new methods such as [...] "microbial capacitive desalination cells" [...] may become available.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flowback</b> is {{the portion}} of the {{injected}} fracturing fluid that flows back to the surface, along with oil, gas, and brine, when the well is produced. An estimated 90% of <b>flowback</b> in the United States is disposed of into deep EPA-licensed Class II disposal wells, with the remaining less than 10% reused, evaporated, used for irrigation, or discharged to surface streams under an NPDES permit. Of nine oil and gas-producing states studied in 2012, underground injection disposal was by far the predominant method in all but Pennsylvania where were only six active waste disposal wells. In California, Virginia, and Ohio there have been instances of illegal dumping of <b>flowback,</b> a precursor to possible contamination of local ground and surface water reservoirs. Discharging oil and gas produced water to surface streams without an NPDES permit is a federal crime. [...] Discharges through water treatment works must comply with the federal Clean Water Act and the terms of their NPDES permits, but the EPA noted that most water treatment works are not set up to treat <b>flowback.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Earthquakes {{large enough}} to be felt by people have also been linked to some deep {{disposal}} wells that receive hydraulic fracturing <b>flowback</b> and produced water from hydraulically fractured wells. <b>Flowback</b> and brine from oil and gas wells are injected into EPA-regulated class II disposal wells. According to the EPA, approximately 144,000 such class II disposal wells in the US receive more than [...] of wastewater each day. [...] To date, the strongest earthquakes triggered by underground waste injection were three quakes close to Richter magnitude 5 recorded in 1967 near a Colorado disposal well which received non-oilfield waste.|$|E
5000|$|The Department of the Interior is {{reportedly}} {{in the process}} of creating regulations governing fracking on Indian and federal land.

5000|$|The {{conductor}} casing {{serves as}} a support during drilling operations, to <b>flowback</b> returns during drilling and cementing of the surface casing, and to prevent collapse of the loose soil near the surface. It can normally vary from sizes such as 18" [...] to 30".|$|E
5000|$|In March 2014, {{news reports}} {{indicated}} that the town included an illegal dump of radioactive mining waste. An abandoned gas station was found to contain hundreds of [...] "filter socks ... used to capture the solids in <b>flowback</b> water during hydraulic fracturing", which trap naturally-occurring radioactive debris.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the water}} used in {{hydraulic}} fracturing is recovered at the surface as <b>flowback</b> or later production brine. The water left in place is called residual treatment water. According to Engelder and Cathles, this residual treatment water becomes permanently sequestered in the shale and cannot seep into and contaminate ground water.|$|E
5000|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} that both {{naturally occurring radionuclides}} and radioactive tracers may return to the surface with <b>flowback</b> and during blow outs. Wastewater from the wells is released into rivers, injected into wells, and evaporated from ponds. The Times reported that studies by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and a confidential study by the drilling industry concluded that radioactivity in drilling waste cannot be fully diluted in rivers and other waterways. [...] Recycling the wastewater has been proposed as a solution but has its limitations. [...] The New York Times has reported on radium and gross alpha radiation levels in wastewater (also called <b>flowback)</b> from natural gas wells. It collected data from more than 200 natural gas wells in Pennsylvania. The New York Times has compiled a map of these wells and their wastewater contamination levels.|$|E

50|$|A 2012 {{study by}} {{researchers}} from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, University of Colorado, and Colorado State University reported {{a reduction in the}} percentage of <b>flowback</b> treated through surface water discharge in Pennsylvania from 2008 through 2011. By late 2012, bromine concentrations had declined to previous levels in the Monongahela River, but remained high in the Allegheny.|$|E
5000|$|A {{report for}} the European Union on the {{potential}} risks was produced in 2012. Potential risks are [...] "methane emissions from the wells, diesel fumes and other hazardous pollutants, ozone precursors or odours from hydraulic fracturing equipment, such as compressors, pumps, and valves". Also gases and hydraulic fracturing fluids dissolved in <b>flowback</b> water pose air emissions risks.|$|E

50|$|According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, {{approximately}} 80,000 {{oil and gas}} {{wells in}} Ohio have been hydraulically fractured since 1951. Ohio does not allow frac <b>flowback</b> or produced brine to be disposed of to surface streams; 98 percent of produced water is injected into Class II disposal wells, the remaining 2 percent is used for dust and ice control on roads, subject to local ordinances.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and {{regulators}} in North Dakota consider radioactive material in <b>flowback</b> a potential hazard to workers at hydraulic fracturing drilling and waste disposal sites and those living or working nearby if the correct procedures are not followed. A {{report from the}} Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection indicated {{that there is little}} potential for radiation exposure from oil and gas operations.|$|E
50|$|In one {{hydraulic}} control variant the valve is opened passively by {{the thrust of}} the medium. In this case the discharge valve has a non-return function which prevents <b>flowback</b> from the pressure line. At the same time the high-densitiy solids are precompacted to close to the line pressure before the discharge valve opens. This means that pipe knocking resulting from pressure pulsations can be avoided.|$|E
50|$|Increases in seismic {{activity}} following hydraulic fracturing along dormant or previously unknown faults are sometimes {{caused by the}} deep-injection disposal of hydraulic fracturing <b>flowback</b> (a byproduct of hydraulically fractured wells), and produced formation brine (a byproduct of both fractured and nonfractured oil and gas wells). For these reasons, hydraulic fracturing is under international scrutiny, restricted in some countries, and banned altogether in others. The European Union is drafting regulations that would permit the controlled application of hydraulic fracturing.|$|E
50|$|In October 2016, Amec Foster Wheeler Infrastructure Ltd (AFWI) {{compared}} {{the environmental impacts}} and risks of unconventional high volume hydraulic fracturing with conventional low volume hydraulic fracturing. The study found that volume of fluid injected and <b>flowback</b> were the only significant differences between conventional low volume and unconventional high volume hydraulic fracturing and that the impacts and risks for high volume hydraulic fracturing scaled up for land take, traffic, surface water contamination and water resource depletion.|$|E
5000|$|Less {{than half}} of {{injected}} water is recovered as <b>flowback</b> or later production brine, {{and in many cases}} recovery is <30%. [...] As the fracturing fluid flows back through the well, it consists of spent fluids and may contain dissolved constituents such as minerals and brine waters. In some cases, depending on the geology of the formation, it may contain uranium, radium, radon and thorium. [...] Estimates of the amount of injected fluid returning to the surface range from 15-20% to 30-70%.|$|E
50|$|In {{a steady}} flow situation, if a wedge is placed into a steady {{supersonic}} flow in sucha way that its oblique attached shock impinges on a flat wall parallel to the free stream,the shock turns the flow toward the wall and a reflected shock is required to turn the <b>flowback</b> to a direction parallel to the wall. When the shock angle exceeds a certain value, thedeflection achievable by a single reflected shock is insufficient to turn the flow back to adirection parallel {{to the wall and}} transition to Mach reflection is observed.|$|E
50|$|Radioactivity {{associated}} with hydraulically fractured wells comes from two sources: {{naturally occurring radioactive material}} and radioactive tracers {{introduced into the}} wells. <b>Flowback</b> from oil and gas wells is usually disposed of deep underground in Class II injection wells, but in Pennsylvania, much of the wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations is processed by public sewage treatment plants. Many sewage plants say that they are incapable of removing the radioactive components of this waste, which is often released into major rivers. Industry officials, though, claim that these levels are diluted enough that public health is not compromised.|$|E
50|$|We {{reject the}} use of {{environmentally}} toxic substances {{in the application of}} fracking technology for exploration and extraction of unconventional natural gas deposits. A request for approval can only be decided upon when the necessary data basis for evaluation exists and is clarified beyond doubt that any adverse change in water quality can be ruled out (precautionary principle of the Water Resources Act). The disposal of <b>flowback</b> from fracking operations with the use environmentally toxic chemicals in injection wells is currently not justifiable due to lack of knowledge of the risks involved.|$|E
50|$|Before 2011, <b>flowback</b> in Pennsylvania was {{processed}} by public wastewater plants, {{which were not}} equipped to remove radioactive material and {{were not required to}} test for it. Industry officials, though, claim that these levels are diluted enough that public health is not compromised. In 2010 the DEP limited surface water discharges from new treatment plants to 250 mg/l chloride. This limitation was designed to also limit other contaminants such as radium. Existing water treatment plants were allowed higher discharge concentrations. In April 2011, the DEP asked unconventional gas operators to voluntarily stop sending wastewater to the grandfathered treatment plants. The PADEP reported that the operators had complied.|$|E
