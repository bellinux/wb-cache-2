Although the region's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state, in some contexts, the territory appears to correspond to the basins of (from west to east) the Haliacmon (Aliákmonas), Vardar / Axios and Struma / Strymónas rivers, and the plains around Thessaloniki and Serres.|$|E

25|$|Luwian {{was among}} the {{languages}} spoken during the 2nd and 1st millennia BC by groups in central and western Anatolia and northern Syria. In the Old Hittite version of the Hittite Code, some, if not all, of the Luwian-speaking areas were called Luwiya. Widmer (2007) {{has argued that the}} Mycenaean term ru-wa-ni-jo, attested in Linear B, refers to the same area. The consensus among scholars is that Luwian was spoken—to varying degrees—across a large portion of western Anatolia, including Troy (Wilusa), the Seha River Land (Sēḫa ~ Sēḫariya, i.e., the Greek Hermos river and Kaikos valley), and the Mira-Kuwaliya kingdom with its core being the Maeander valley. This is suggested by, among other things, a corrupt late copy of the Hittite Code in which the <b>geographical</b> <b>term</b> Luwiya is replaced with Arzawa, a western Anatolian kingdom corresponding roughly with Mira and the Seha River Land. In the post-Hittite era, the region of Arzawa {{came to be known as}} Lydia (Assyrian Luddu, Greek Λυδία), where the Lydian language was in use. The name Lydia has been derived from the name Luwiya (Lydian *lūda- < *luw(i)da- < luwiya-, with regular Lydian sound change y > d), which further argues in favour of the location of Luwiya in the west.|$|E
500|$|The <b>geographical</b> <b>term</b> Bharat ( [...] , [...] ), {{which is}} {{recognised}} by the Constitution of India {{as an official}} name for the country, is used by many Indian languages in its variations.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} Russian <b>geographical</b> <b>terms</b> in the Karelian dialects of Tver Region and is mainly based on field {{materials}} {{collected by the}} author in the 2000 s. The author argues that the main corpus of <b>geographical</b> <b>terms</b> and place names of the studied area is of Karelian origin and correlates with geographical terminology and toponymy of other groups of the Karelian population that migrated in the past from the north-eastern Lake Onega Region. At the same time, as distinct from other areas of settlement of the Karelian population, the dialects of Tver Karelians are rich in loan words from the Russian language which appeared in different periods: a part of them represent traditional <b>geographical</b> <b>terms</b> of the Russian population of Tver Region, while others seem to be relatively recent innovations, mainly of the Soviet period. According to the data provided by the author, approximately 40 % of current <b>geographical</b> <b>terms</b> of the Karelian dialects of Tver region are of Russian origin. This proportion {{can be explained by}} the specificity of the landscape of the studied territory which differs from the landscape of the original Karelian areas, as well as by Tver Karelians' long habitation in the Central Russian Historical Zone which made permanent contacts with the Russian population inevitable...|$|R

2500|$|The word Hindu {{is derived}} from the Indo-Aryan/Sanskrit root Sindhu, the Indo-Aryan name for the Indus River in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent (modern day Pakistan and Northern India). According to Gavin Flood, [...] "The actual term 'Hindu' first occurs as a Persian <b>geographical</b> <b>term</b> for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu)", more {{specifically}} in the 6th-century BCE inscription of Darius I (550–486 BCE). The term Hindu in these ancient records is a <b>geographical</b> <b>term</b> and did not refer to a religion. Among the earliest known records of 'Hindu' with connotations of religion may be in the 7th-century CE Chinese text Record of the Western Regions by Xuanzang, and 14th-century Persian text Futuhu's-salatin by 'Abd al-Malik Isami.|$|E
