40|$|Effective protein {{characterization}} and identification is a demanding and time-consuming operation in proteomics because of long protein purification/separation procedures and even longer enzymatic digestions. In this work, polymer-based monolithic <b>enzyme</b> <b>reactors</b> were fabricated in fused-silica capillaries, and performance was characterized through protein digestion and identification by MALDI-MS and ESI-MS. Trypsin and Staphylococcus aureus V- 8 protease (Glu-C) {{were used to}} produce three types of reactors: trypsin-based, Glu-C based and tandem trypsin Glu-C. Reactors were prepared by synthesizing a porous methacrylate base monolith followed by photografting with glycidyl methacrylate, and immobilization of the enzyme(s) with carbonyldiimidazole. Protein digestions, performed by perfusing protein solutions through the reactor under pressure, were evaluated based on the peptide map generated when directly coupled to an ESI mass spectrometer. Excellent digestion efficiencies were observed over a flow rate range from 0. 2 to 1 oL min - 1, which corresponds to reactor residence times of 1. 4 to 0. 24 min.

The proposed system utilizes an on-line gas predialysis unit in conjuction with a flow-through <b>enzyme</b> <b>reactor</b> coil and a potentiometric ammonia detector. The <b>enzyme</b> <b>reactor</b> contains immobilized creatinine iminohydrolase (EC 3. 5. 4. 21) which converts creatinine to ammonia and N-methylhydantoin.

Thus, final peak potentials recorded by the electrode detector are directly proportional to the logarithm of creatinine concentrations present. The method is shown to be precise (< 3 %), selective, and capable of accurately determining creatinine in serum and urine samples containing abnormally high endogenous ammonia levels.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{flow-through}} <b>enzyme</b> <b>reactor</b> {{system for}} the determination of urea using conductimetric measurement is described. Samples are introduced as pulses in a continuous flow of buffer which is passed through a dialyser. The dialysis solution {{on the other side}} of the dialysis membrane collects urea molecules from the samples which diffuse through the membrane and is pumped through an <b>enzyme</b> <b>reactor</b> containing urease immobilized to porous glass. Conductivity electrodes are used to measure the increase in conductivity of the dialysis solution resulting from the hydrolysis of urea into charged products. The effects of the flow rate and the possible interferences of cells or NaCl in the sample solutions to the response of the enzyme sensor system have been investigated. The system is used for the determination of urea in standard solutions as well as in human blood serum samples. The enzyme sensor is operated in a linear mode in the concentration range 5 - 70 mmol/L (correlation coefficient, r = 0. 998). Good agreement is obtained when the urea concentrations of human blood serum samples are determined using the enzyme sensor system compared to the diacetyl monoxime colorimetric method (r = 0. 997) and to the results obtained by a commercial automated analysis system (r = 0. 998) ...|$|E

The performance of capillary IMERs for protein digestion was {{evaluated by the}} digestion of myoglobin with the residential time from 12 s to 71 s. With mu RPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis, the obtained sequence coverages were all over 80 %, comparable to that obtained by in-solution digestion for 12 h. The nonspecific absorption of BSA on monolithic support was evaluated, and no obvious protein residue was observed by a fluorescence assay. Moreover, no carry-over of the digests on the capillary IMER was found after the digestion of myoglobin (24 mu g) and BSA (9 mu g), which further demonstrated the good hydrophilicity of such matrix. In addition, an integrated microchip-based system involving on-line protein digestion by microchip-based IMER, peptides separation by nanoRPLC and identification by ESI-MS/MS was established, by which a mixture of standard proteins and one RPLC fraction of Escherichia coli extract were successfully identified, indicating that the hydrophilic monolith based IMER might provide a promising tool for high-throughput proteomic analysis.
