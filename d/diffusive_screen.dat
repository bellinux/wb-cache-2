40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a three-dimensional (3 D) hologram display system. The 3 D hologram display system includes a projector device for projecting an image upon a display medium {{to form a}} 3 D hologram. The 3 D hologram is formed such that a viewer can view the holographic image from multiple angles up to 360 degrees. Multiple display media are described, namely a spinning <b>diffusive</b> <b>screen,</b> a circular diffuser screen, and an aerogel. The spinning <b>diffusive</b> <b>screen</b> utilizes spatial light modulators to control the image such that the 3 D image is displayed on the rotating screen in a time-multiplexing manner. The circular diffuser screen includes multiple, simultaneously-operated projectors to project the image onto the circular diffuser screen from a plurality of locations, thereby forming the 3 D image. The aerogel can use the projection device described as applicable to either the spinning <b>diffusive</b> <b>screen</b> or the circular diffuser screen...|$|E
30|$|For calcium imaging of SINs, we used double {{transgenic}} zebrafish Tg(Gal 4 - 1156 t,UAS:GCaMP-HS) larvae {{that were}} obtained by crossing Tg(UAS:GCaMP-HS) (gift from Dr. Koichi Kawakami) with the Gal 4 enhancer trap line Tg(Gal 4 - 1156 t) (ZIRC). Confocal calcium imaging was carried out under a 40 ×, 0.8 NA water-immersion objective using an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope. A recording chamber was custom built with one side enclosed by a <b>diffusive</b> <b>screen.</b> The larva was mounted dorsal side up in ~ 1.5 % agarose {{on the edge of}} a raised platform in the imaging chamber, allowing an unobstructed view of the projected stimuli on the screen of the chamber and positioned with the contralateral eye facing the projection area, which covered a visual field of approximately 110 ° by 110 °.|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} the physics results, derived from the {{analysis}} of the data collected at the Pierre Auger Observatory depends heavily on the calibration and monitoring of the components of the detectors. It is crucial to maintain a database containing complete information on the absolute calibration of all photomultipliers and their time evolution. The low rate of the physics events implies that the analysis will have to be made {{over a long period of}} operation. This requirement imposes a very organized and reliable data storage and data management strategy, in order to guarantee correct data preservation and high data quality. The Fluorescence Detector (FD) consists of 27 telescopes with about 12, 000 phototubes which have to be calibrated periodically. A special absolute calibration system is used. It is based on a calibrated light source with a <b>diffusive</b> <b>screen,</b> uniformly illuminating photomultipliers of the camera. This absolute calibration is performed every few years, as its use is not compatible with the operation of the detector. To monitor the stability and the time behavior, another light source system operates every night of data taking. This relative calibration procedure yields more than 2 × 10 [sup] 4 raw files each year, about 1 TByte/year. In this paper we describe a new web-interfaced database architecture to manage, store, produce and analyse FD calibration data. It contains the configuration and operating parameters of the detectors at each instant and other relevant functional parameters that are needed for the analysis or to monitor possible instabilities, used for the early discovery of malfunctioning components. Based on over 10 years of operation, we present results on the long term performance of FD and its dependence on environmental variables. We also report on a check of the absolute calibration values by analysing the signals left by stars traversing the FD field of view...|$|E
40|$|The CLIC {{study is}} based on the {{so-called}} two-beam acceleration concept and one of the main goals of the CLIC Test Facility 3 is to demonstrate the efficiency of the CLIC RF power production scheme. As part of this facility a Test Beam Line (TBL), presently under commissioning, is a small-scale version of a CLIC decelerator. To perform as expected the beam line must show efficient and stable RF power production over 16 consecutive decelerating structures. As the high intensity electron beam is decelerated its energy spread grows by up to 60 %. A novel segmented beam dump for time resolved energy measurements has been designed to match the requirements of the TBL. As a complement, a <b>diffusive</b> OTR <b>screen</b> is also installed in the same spectrometer line. The combination of these two devices will provide both a high spatial resolution measurement of both the energy and energy spread and a measurement with a few nanoseconds time response. This paper describes the design of the new segmented dump and presents the results from the first commissioning of the TBL spectrometer line...|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} the interaction kernel K for two-dimensional <b>diffusive</b> electrons. The <b>screening</b> of the Coulomb interaction {{together with the}} Fermi statistics induces a spin selection rule for electron-electron scattering so that in leading order in the inverse conductance only pairs of electrons with antiparallel spins do scatter. At low temperature, {{this results in a}} larger coherence length for fully polarized electrons and thus in a positive in-plane magnetoresistance. An applied in-plane magnetic field also induces a nonmonotonous behavior of K at finite temperature. Alternatively, the vanishing of the scattering in the triplet channel strongly reduces ferromagnetism deep in the metallic regime. These effects weaken as the density of charge carriers is reduced.

40|$|Information {{security}} {{is a growing concern}} in our modern world, where almost everything can be done online. To protect security, classical encryption protocols, such as RSA, are used. These encryption protocols are almost always based on mathematical problems that are computational difficult. Therefore, the {{security is}} only valid under limited computational resources, and therefore do not provide provable security. An exception is the one-time pad protocol, which is provably secure but requires an existing shared key that is as long as the information it must encrypt. The exchange of such a key can be challenging, often requiring the two partied to physically meet to exchange the key or the use a trusted courier to physically carry the key on a hard drive. Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a solution by utilizing quantum mechanics to grow a secure cryptographic key shared between two distant parties. The quantum nature of the particles used in the exchange ensure that any eavesdropper would leave signs of their presence, allowing the users to precisely quantify the security of the key that is produced. This allows secure generation of a random key which can be used for the one-time pad encryption protocol which, unlike most encryption protocols, does not rely on computational assumptions, and is secure regardless of available computational power. Current implementations of QKD are limited to a single link distance of ≈ 200 km, preventing implementation of QKD on a global scale, or even between distant cities within a single country, without some additional techniques. One promising solution is the use of orbiting low Earth orbit satellite platforms as trusted nodes in a quantum communications network. The main purpose of this work has been to show the viability of this solution, trough theoretical performance modeling and experimental demonstrations. Thorough numerical simulations have been developed to evaluate the performance and challenges in implementing QKD using a low Earth orbit satellite platform and determine an optimal approach to its implementation. The simulations include a realistic satellite orbit analysis, all expected loss mechanisms, estimates of background contributions and realistic simulation of quantum optical processes. This work addresses the questions of optimal wavelength and beam waist, the effect of the telescope design and pointing error, and the impact of detector degradation due to exposure to radiation in the space environment. The simulation is used to determine the length of secure key for QKD and the performance of fundamental quantum optics experiments such as Bell tests and quantum teleportation. We compare {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} uplink and dowlink scenarios, and show that an uplink, despite having reduced performance compared to a downlink, offers more scientific freedom, by allowing changes to the quantum source, and benefits from a simpler satellite design with reduced pointing requirement. This work provides a theoretical foundation for ongoing design and development of quantum systems for satellite implementation of QKD. In addition to theoretical analyses, experiments where developed and conducted corresponding to the challenges likely to be faced by a satellite uplink. Two main challenges where identified and experimentally overcome. First, the difficulty of operating in the high loss regime of a satellite uplink, which typically experience losses in the range of 40 - 50 dB when above 40 ° of elevation from the horizon, an elevation only reached by half of the satellite passes. This challenge was addressed by demonstrating full QKD protocols at losses exceeding 50 dB. Also, the ability to perform full QKD during the short duration of a satellite pass was shown by replicating the varying loss of archetypal passes and successfully extracting secure keys. Secondly, the difficulty of accurately tracking and pointing to a receiver platform traveling at the high angular speed of a satellite was overcome by successfully exchange quantum signals to a truck traveling at angular speeds exceeding that of a low Earth orbit satellite. This required the design, construction, and implementation of a transmitter system and a quantum receiver system capable of active pointing using a custom pointing system. An additional experiment was also performed where we experimentally investigate the feasibility of performing QKD using light scattered by a <b>diffusive</b> <b>screen.</b> A system capable of doing so could be used to create QKD hot-spots, where a QKD source could be aimed at a <b>diffusive</b> <b>screen</b> to allow multiple users to simultaneously exchange secure keys with the source without the need for high precision pointing. Through these analyses and experimental demonstrations we evaluated the performance of QKD using a satellite and have shown its technological readiness to be implemented. Implementation of such a system would allow QKD to be performed on a global scale, enabling communications security that is not based on computational assumptions without the need to physically transport the key from one party to the other...|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se avaliar produção de biomassa, acúmulo de nitrato, teores e exportação de macronutrientes das cultivares de alface Regina e Verônica, em cultivo a céu aberto e sob duas malhas termorrefletoras (Aluminet® 30 %-O e Aluminet® 40 %-O) e uma difusora (ChromatiNet Difusor® 30 %), em {{experiment}}o conduzido na Universidade Federal de Viçosa (MG). As malhas termorrefletoras e difusora foram instaladas em estruturas tipo telados retangulares fechados, com 2 x 4 x 36 m (altura, largura e comprimento). A semeadura foi realizada em bandejas de 200 células, preenchidas com substrato comercial, sob ambiente protegido, em 31 / 05 / 02. O transplante foi realizado em 26 / 06 / 02 e a colheita em 06 / 08 / 02, ocasião em que foram feitas as avaliações. Avaliou-se a produção de biomassa, teor de nitrato, teores e exportação de macronutrientes. 'Regina' apresentou folhas mais tenras do que a 'Verônica', portanto mais adequadas a mercados mais exigentes, porém, com maior teor de nitrato. Considerando os aspectos quantitativo e qualitativo da produção sugere-se o uso das malhas Aluminet® 40 %-O e ChromatiNet Difusor® 30 %; todavia, deve-se ajustar adequadamente a adubação nitrogenada para que não haja acúmulo de nitrato a níveis elevados devido a restrição de luz promovida pelas malhas. Ambientes e cultivares influenciaram nos teores e quantidades exportadas dos nutrientes. Com relação à exportação de nutrientes observou-se a ordem K>N>Ca>P>Mg>S. In {{this experiment}} we evaluated the production, accumulation of nitrate, content and exportable mineral nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg e S) of lettuce cultivars Regina and Verônica cultivated under two thermo-reflective screens (Aluminet® 30 %-O and Aluminet® 40 %-O), and a <b>diffusive</b> <b>screen</b> (ChromatiNet Difusor® 30 %). The trial {{was carried out}} in Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Seeds were sown in trays of 200 cells, under protected atmosphere, on 05 / 31 / 02. The transplant was accomplished on 06 / 26 / 02 and the harvest on 08 / 06 / 02, when the evaluations were performed. The thermo-reflective and diffusive screens were installed in structures type 'shut rectangular fence', with 2 x 4 x 36 m (height, width and length), close to the cultivation under open sky (control). We evaluated the production of mass, content of nitrate, content and exportable mineral nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg e S). 'Regina' presented more tender leaves than the 'Verônica', therefore being more appropriate to the high quality demanding markets, even so, with larger content of nitrate. Considering the quantitative and qualitative aspects, the Aluminet® 40 % and ChromatiNet Difusor® 30 % screens should be recommended; though, the nitrogen should be adjusted to avoid the accumulation of nitrate. The growing conditions and cultivars influenced content and exportable mineral nutrients. With relation to the export of nutrients the following order was observed: K>N>Ca>P>Mg>S...|$|E
