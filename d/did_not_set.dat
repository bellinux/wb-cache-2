Nico Rosberg was second, about {{a tenth of a}} second behind, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>set</b> any timed laps in the last twenty minutes as his car was losing gearbox oil. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile struggled on the super-soft tyres, making several errors that left him fifth. Both Lotus cars made it into the top ten, with Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean in fourth and seventh respectively. Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso was the fastest Renault-powered car in eighth position, while the McLarens once again had to stop their session early.|$|E
5|$|As {{a prelude}} to his planned {{campaign}} in Greece, Philip went on campaign {{in the winter of}} 339 BC, against the Scythians living south of the Danube, near the river's mouth (in Dobruja). He defeated them in battle, taking many captive, and built a statue of Heracles to commemorate his victory. He then marched through the territory of the Triballi in a demonstration of force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube. During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it and killed the horse he was riding. Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's campaign in Greece, since he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>set</b> off until the autumn of 339 BC.|$|E

Nevertheless, both Mercedes drivers did not go out again. Sebastian Vettel set a second timed lap to improve his time, now {{a little more than}} a tenth behind Hamilton. Many drivers only set one timed lap towards the end of the session, with Pastor Maldonado, Felipe Nasr, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Daniil Kvyat unable to move on into Q3, while Ricciardo <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>set</b> a time, leaving him fifteenth for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Purcell <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>set</b> any of Shakespeare's text to music; {{instead he}} {{composed}} music for short masques in every act but the first. The play itself was also slightly modernised {{in keeping with}} seventeenth-century dramatic conventions, but in the main the spoken text is as Shakespeare wrote it. The masques {{are related to the}} play metaphorically, rather than literally. Many critics have stated that they bear no relationship to the play. Recent scholarship has shown that the opera, which ends with a masque featuring Hymen, the God of Marriage, was composed for the fifteenth wedding anniversary of William III and Mary II.|$|E
