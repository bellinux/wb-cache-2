5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Armistice on 11 November, which ended all fighting, O'Brien transported mail and {{passengers}} between Brest, France, and Plymouth, England.

5|$|Both ships {{served in}} the East Asia station with the East Asia Squadron; Prinzess Wilhelm {{played a major role}} in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay {{concession}} in November 1897. Both ships returned to Germany at the turn of the 20th century, and remained in <b>European</b> <b>waters</b> until 1914, when they were removed from active service.

5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1917, the {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare campaign—which Germany had launched {{at the beginning of}} February—had so succeeded that the entire Allied war effort was endangered. Strong reinforcements to the Allied antisubmarine forces were desperately needed to avert defeat and needed at once. In response to a request from the Royal Navy for the service of American antisubmarine warfare ships in <b>European</b> <b>waters,</b> the United States Navy began sending destroyers eastward across the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|After {{considering}} the Royal Commission's recommendations the Dutch Government decided to purchase four battleships. All the ships {{were to be}} permanently stationed in the NEI, and none would be used in <b>European</b> <b>waters.</b> The ships were larger than those proposed by the commission, however. Idenburg opposed this decision, and unsuccessfully argued {{for at least a}} fifth battleship to be built. In October 1913 it was rumored that the Government was about to order the first ship, {{and that it would be}} paid for by a loan borne by NEI.|$|E
5|$|All three {{ships of}} the Königsberg class served as {{training}} cruisers for naval cadets throughout the 1930s. They conducted numerous cruises in <b>European</b> <b>waters,</b> and both Karlsruhe and Köln traveled to other continents. They were all modified throughout the decade, and had their anti-aircraft armament repeatedly improved, {{along with other}} alterations. The three ships {{took part in the}} non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in 19361939, and after the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, they laid a series of defensive minefields in the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|Between 7 June and 26 August, New Jersey formed part of {{the first}} {{training}} squadron to cruise Northern <b>European</b> <b>waters</b> since the beginning of World War II.

Connolly, Commander Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, who broke his flag in New Jersey at Rosyth, Scotland 23 June. She was the scene of official receptions at Oslo, where King Haakon VII of Norway inspected the crew 2 July, and at Portsmouth, England.

5|$|Both ships {{served in}} the East Asia station with the East Asia Squadron; Prinzess Wilhelm {{played a major role}} in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay {{concession}} in November 1897, under command of Admiral Otto von Diederichs. The two ships were sent to safeguard German interests in the Philippines after the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. There, Irenes presence caused tensions with the American squadron occupying the islands. Both ships returned to Germany at the turn of the century, and remained in <b>European</b> <b>waters</b> until 1914, when they were removed from active service. They were reduced to secondary roles—Irene was used as a submarine tender and Prinzess Wilhelm was hulked—and continued to serve until the early 1920s, when they were sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Operation Leader {{was both}} the only {{offensive}} operation {{undertaken by the}} US Navy in northern <b>European</b> <b>waters</b> during World War II, and the last major American operation in this theatre of the war. Ranger remained with the Home Fleet until being replaced by British aircraft carriers in late November 1943, during which time she {{took part in a}} patrol of the Norwegian Sea. The carrier departed Scapa Flow on 26 November, and arrived in Boston on 6 December. Ranger was used to train aircrews and transport aircraft {{for the remainder of the}} war, and did not see combat again.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 7 May 1794 {{was a minor}} naval action fought {{between a}} British ship {{of the line and}} a French frigate early in the French Revolutionary Wars. The French Navy sought to disrupt British trade by intercepting and {{capturing}} merchant ships with roving frigates, a strategy countered by protecting British convoys with heavier warships, particularly in <b>European</b> <b>waters.</b> On 5 May 1794, the British escorts of a convoy from Cork sighted two French ships approaching and gave chase. The ships, a frigate and a corvette, outmatched by their opponents, separated and the convoy escorts did likewise, each following one of the raiders on a separate course.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately {{the revolutionary}} {{excesses of the}} period would prove {{disastrous}} for the French Navy. Poor leadership, conflicting and arbitrary orders and the decimation of the experienced seamen in the ranks promoted a negative attitude in the French officer corps. The French battlefleet did not contest British dominance in Northern <b>European</b> <b>waters</b> again, and their raiding operations repeatedly ended in failure {{at the hands of}} more confident British squadrons and the unforgiving Atlantic weather. By 1805, when the last great French fleet to take to the sea was crushed at the Battle of Trafalgar, poor training and low investment in the Navy had reduced its efficiency to levels unthinkable 20years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Allemand's {{expedition}} of 1805, {{often referred}} to as the Escadre invisible (invisible squadron) in French sources, was an important French naval expedition during the Napoleonic Wars, which formed a major diversion to the ongoing Trafalgar Campaign in the Atlantic Ocean. With the French Mediterranean Fleet at sea, Emperor Napoleon I hoped to unite it with the French Atlantic Fleet and together form a force powerful enough to temporarily displace the British Royal Navy Channel Fleet for long enough to allow an invasion force to cross the English Channel and land in Britain. In support of this plan, the French squadron based at Rochefort put to sea in July 1805, initially with the intention that they would join the Atlantic Fleet from Brest. When this fleet failed to put to sea, the Rochefort squadron, under Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand, went on an extended raiding cruise across the Atlantic, both to intercept British trade left lightly defended by the concentration of British forces in <b>European</b> <b>waters</b> and with the intention of eventually combining with the French Mediterranean Fleet then blockaded in Spanish harbours.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} French Revolutionary Wars (1793–1802), {{a string of}} {{victories}} at sea ensured that the Royal Navy was dominant. The French Navy in particular had suffered heavy losses, and in Northern <b>European</b> <b>waters</b> had been forced back into its own harbours by British blockade squadrons. Although large ports were watched by fleets of ships of the line, small ports had their own blockade squadrons too, including the shallow French ports on the English Channel. These harbours could not accommodate ships of the line but were well situated for frigates that attacked shipping in British waters whenever they could escape the blockade. One such port was Dunkirk in French Flanders, which contained a squadron of four French frigates: the 44-gun Poursuivante under Commodore Jean-Joseph Castagnier, the 40-gun Carmagnole and the 36-gun Désirée and Incorruptible. Dunkirk was well defended, with gun batteries and gunboats overlooking the harbour. In addition, the port was surrounded by complicated coastal shoals into which the frigates could retreat if attacked.|$|E
