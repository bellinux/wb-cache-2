40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} an {{economic}} overview of the opportunities for <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of single-family houses in Denmark financed over the long term. The paper focuses on the economic difference between energy savings and the repayment of investment. Taking out the average remaining 20 % equity in long-term property mortgage loans and utilising it for extensive <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> improves both {{the economy and the}} extent of included measures. Approximately 30 % of energy consumption in Denmark is used for space heating. The existing 1 million single-family houses account for approximately half of this, thus making <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> a key factor for the reduction of CO 2 emissions. The conclusions were that in average the possible budget for renovation varied between [euro] 20, 000 and 40, 000 per single-family house. The equity of the house was particularly dependant on geographical location and construction period. Different <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> measures were analysed in terms of economy showing that a wide range of specific measures had a positive economic balance for the homeowner from year 1. The economic balance between saved energy and repayment of the investment is however very dependent on the assumed future energy price. An example showed that a typical house from 1925, still in its original form, could yield annual savings for the homeowner of approximately [euro] 2600, assuming a future energy price of 0. 2 [euro]/kWÂ h. At the current energy price level of 0. 1 [euro]/kWÂ h <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> in general is almost economically neutral for the homeowner.

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>renovations</b> of single-family {{houses in}} Sweden are moving slowly, but if energy renovated, these houses hold great {{potential}} for decreased energy consumption. This could imply a new area of exploration regarding potential business opportunities for SME contractors. The slow movement of <b>energy</b> <b>renovations</b> creates a challenge however. Previous {{research has focused on}} SME contractors and their work or house owners and their behavior, but to understand the lack of <b>energy</b> <b>renovations,</b> {{it is not enough to}} examine only either/or. It is also necessary to study the interaction between these two actors in order to understand how the space is being used and how they negotiate what needs to be done. The aim of the thesis was thus to extend our understanding of SME contractors within the construction and energy sector in southwest Sweden and their interactions with single-family house owners as potential customers. The aim was also to explore further whether increased understanding of SME contractors developing their businesses towards <b>energy</b> <b>renovations</b> of single-family houses could bring more light to contractors’ interactions with house owners as potential customers and the lack of <b>energy</b> <b>renovations</b> of single-family houses in Sweden. An interpretivist understanding, using Goffman’s dramaturgical theory (Goffman, 1959; 1961), was initiated to explore the interactions while Action research is the methodology and framework for this study. The method was used to work with the SME contractors in developing their businesses towards <b>energy</b> <b>renovations.</b> However, since action research focuses on social change, and Goffman’s dramaturgical theory focuses of stabilized actions, it is necessary to discuss how the two perspectives are merged. In order to achieve the aim, a combination of methods was needed. Two main methods were used: 18 observations of interactions between SME contractors and house owners, when they were discussing possible improvement measures in the house owners’ homes; and 16 workshops with three groups of SME contractors (a total of 26) collaborating to develop their businesses to find new ways to work with <b>energy</b> <b>renovations</b> of single-family houses. One of these groups developed a new concept regarding <b>energy</b> <b>renovations</b> of single-family houses, and in addition to the observations, this thesis is based on this group’s collaboration. This thesis demonstrates that SME contractors express some insecurity regarding their roles, their role performances, and also some of the materials and possible solutions they could use; and it shows how these insecurities shape and structure their interactions with house owners. Tensions were highlighted involving roles and performances, which together with insecurities create challenges for innovation and implementation of new practices. In addition, the study shows that interactions between SME contractors and house owners comprise a key aspect of the lack of <b>energy</b> <b>renovations</b> of single-family houses. The interaction with the established roles and performances locks the two actors into a routinized play that is difficult to change. This creates blocks for new input. Thus, to place SME contractors on the stage as responsible for the lack of <b>energy</b> <b>renovations</b> is to disregard the constraints of their professional role, which is created by the contractor’s interaction with the house owner at the house owner’s home...|$|R

To this we can contribute with improved energy efficiency of buildings that we can achieve with <b>energy</b> <b>renovation.</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of buildings is an engineering project with which we reach that the buildings consume at least half of the energy for heating or cooling as before the renovation. In this master’s thesis we are studying the <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of buildings and the methods of façade measuring. Topic largely covers the area of geodesy, which deals with both classical method of surveying and terrestrial laser scanning. At the same time it also covers the area of <b>energy</b> <b>renovation,</b> which is associated with energetic and construction. We reviewed the area of <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> and the possibility of participating geodetics profession in the façade measurements. Our focus was on the classical terrestrial measurement and terrestrial laser scanning, wireframe buildings and prefabricated façade elements. The need to ensure a high level of precision we needed to pay attention to the establishment of a geodetic reference network in the vicinity of the present building. Based on the reference case, we want to draw conclusions regarding the selection of relevant geodetic methods on the basis of selected buildings and the chosen method of <b>energy</b> <b>renovation.</b> A practical field measurement was carried out following various post processing. For field measurement, we used an advanced surveying instrument that combines different measurement techniques.

40|$|AbstractRenovation of {{dwellings}} {{for energy}} efficiency has further implications other than only technical and economic dimensions, such as performance and cost reduction. This paper demonstrates how {{the renovation of}} dwellings for energy efficiency impacts spatial quality by crossing technical measures of dwelling renovation with the definition of spatial quality proposed in Acre and Wyckmans (2014). The results of this crossing are developed further into a spatial quality assessment. Spatial quality consists {{of the interaction between}} four determinants: (1) views, (2) internal spatiality and spatial arrangements, (3) transition between public and private spaces, and (4) perceived, built and human densities (Acre and Wyckmans, 2014). There are two main challenges in this work: first to demonstrate that <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of dwellings affects spatial quality and second, to create a clear and generic way to indicate and assess this effect that also allows comparability between before and after renovation. The current state of the art in building renovation emphasizes technical performance and efficiency, costs and user responses to technology. However, there is a facet that is hardly explored in the current literature, which is how building renovation affects spatial quality. This paper contributes both to the theory and practice in building renovation. First it emphasizes the relevance of non-technical dimensions such as spatial quality and of the need for a cross-disciplinary approach in <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of dwellings. Second, the paper indicates that <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> indeed affects spatial quality in dwellings. The main contribution to practice that this article aims to bring forward consists of the spatial quality assessment for dwelling renovation. The technical measures of <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> for the building components of floors, internal and external walls, roofs, windows, mechanical services and controls, built area and the use of renewable energy options are considered in this study in relation to their impact on spatial quality. The aim is to identify and strengthen the connection between <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> and people’s well-being through spatial quality. The inattention to the potential of non-technical dimensions such as spatial quality, by stakeholders involved in the <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of dwellings, constitutes a lost opportunity to increase occupants’ receptiveness to <b>energy</b> <b>renovation.</b> This receptiveness can be extended by strengthening the connection between renovation of dwellings for energy efficiency and benefits to occupants’ well-being. This work follows the current European tendency of fostering energy deep renovation to reach Europe’s 2050 aspirations (BPIE, 2011). Deep renovation is an ambitious building renovation strategy that encourages high energy savings measures and the whole building approach (BPIE, 2013).

40|$|The UK’s {{housing stock}} {{is among the}} oldest and least {{efficient}} in Europe. 85 % of the UK’s existing homes will still be standing and in use in 2050. Improving the energy efficiency of UK housing stock is an essential requirement {{in order for the}} UK to meet its 2008 Climate Change Act obligations. Energy efficiency in buildings is the focus of European (EU) policies with the intention of creating a low-carbon economy by 2020. Reducing energy consumption in existing buildings is essential to achieving this. Government policies are the primary mechanism for lowering energy consumption through changing consumer behaviour, promoting low carbon technology and <b>energy</b> efficient <b>renovations</b> of old building stock. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the effectiveness of UK policies at addressing factors affecting consumer decisions to carry out <b>energy</b> efficient <b>renovations.</b> This is with the intention of determining if UK policies are effectively contributing to the government’s long term climate change commitments. Using a theory developed by Parker (2000) as a conceptual framing of policy compliance, this study conducts interviews with consumers in order to analyse their awareness, understanding and perception of UK energy efficiency policies.

40|$|Purpose – Non-technical {{dimensions}} such as spatial quality {{are just}} as relevant for energy efficiency as technical and economic dimensions in the renovation of dwellings. However, the significance of non-technical dimensions is often neglected in the <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of dwellings. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to demonstrate how the renovation of dwellings for energy efficiency influences spatial quality in the MS- 1 building in the neighbourhood of Arlequin, Grenoble, France. The Arlequin case study is part of the ZenN project, nearly zero energy neighbourhoods, funded by the European 7 th Framework Programme (Grant Agreement No. 314363). Design/methodology/approach – The impact of the renovation on spatial quality is analysed by crossing technical measures, applied in the <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of dwellings with the definition of spatial quality proposed by Acre and Wyckmans (2014). The spatial quality definition results from a literature review on quality of design and urban life, wherein works of Weber (1995) and Gehl (2010, 2011) are related to the residential use in the scales of the building and block. The impact of renovation on spatial quality is further evaluated by using the spatial quality assessment developed by Acre and Wyckmans (2015). The impact on spatial quality is observed by considering all the renovation measures, instead of only considering the measures primarily related to energy performance. This emphasises the need for a cross-disciplinary approach between technical and non-technical dimensions in the <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of dwellings. Findings – The results display both negative and positive impacts of the <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> on spatial quality in the dwellings and emphasise the potential of non-technical dimensions in promoting renovation. The impact on spatial quality is primarily negative when only measures adopted in order to improve energy efficiency are considered in the evaluation. Originality/value – This paper consists of a novel crossing of technical and non-technical dimensions in <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of dwellings.

The phasing-out of inefficient buildings from the European building stock requires an EU renovation plan. To be successful, this plan should incorporate the existing EU policy frameworks for growth and jobs, energy and climate and those related to cohesion policies into one single framework targeting the modernisation of the overall value chain of the building sector. Converting Europe’s building stock from being an energy waster to being an energy producer would require a clear, coherent and decentralised governance structure including an <b>Energy</b> <b>Renovation</b> Facilitator and a Risk Sharing Pool cascaded at different levels of governance.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the context}} of the European Horizon 2020 project MORE-CONNECT on prefab deep <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of {{dwellings}} pilot demonstration projects are carried out in 6 of the participating countries. In Denmark the pilot project comprises a comprehensive <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of three building blocks situated in Roskilde - southwest of Copenhagen. An <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> concept for these buildings has been developed according to a methodology developed for the MORE-CONNECT project aiming towards a Zero Energy Building (ZEB) level. The energy requirement for heating purposes is therefore to be brought down from around 100 kWh/m 2 to below 20 kWh/m 2 and a part of the electricity consumption to be produced by PV. The methodology calls for a calculation of total costs versus reduced Global Warming Potential (GWP) and primary energy consumption. The developed concept includes additional insulation in the external walls and roof, new 3 -layer low-energy windows, a heat recovery ventilation system and renewable energy supply. Within the MORE-CONNECT two technologies are under development in Denmark: A new PV-roof solution in which the PV-cells are fully integrated in the roofing elements. This PV-roof can be fitted into any roof surface shape and if justified by the cost-optimisation it can be constructed as a PVT-roof connected to a heat-pump for heating purposes. The second technology under development is 3 -D printing of a layer of façade insulation by an industry robot. The concept development follows first a path using conventionally available technologies and at the end the two new technologies are integrated in the concept and the corresponding traditionally technologies removed.

40|$|As {{a result}} of EU’s {{legislations}} for reducing energy demands in buildings, {{a large number of}} studies have been done about cost-effective renovation of building stocks in EU. To complement the available results, in this work we take into account the microeconomic perspective of building owners, whose major challenge is to decide about limited budget allocation for <b>energy</b> <b>renovation.</b> Therefore, this work presents results of optimal and cost-effective <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of single-family houses in Swedish building stock. The houses are categorised based on the year of construction (about 1970 s, 1980 s and 1990 s) and their location (i. e. four Swedish climate zones). The space heat demand of representative houses for each age category and climate zone is simulated to analyse optimum renovation. A reformed method of NPV is employed in order to, simultaneously, analyse the cost-optimum renovation measures of the house envelope and their cost-effectiveness. The results indicate that the space heat demand in the representative house of 1970 is reduced from 28 % in climate zone 1 to 25 % in zone 4, when all measures are implemented to a cost-optimal level. The results of similar exercise for the houses of 1990 suggest “do nothing” scenario for <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> to cost-optimal level, considering discount rate of 3 %. However, if the necessity of renovation is determined, then the reduced space heat demand is from 13 % in climate zone 1 to 8 % in zone 4.

In order to reduce these values, the European Union (UE) has been strengthening and updating the regulations which define the minimum energy requirements for buildings. Therefore, Member States started to increase their energy requirements for buildings, with the purpose to raise their efficiency, reduce their emissions and energy needs, making them more sustainable at the energy level.

The renova-tion of building envelopes could bring significant energy savings {{not only from the}} point of view of low energy consumption and reduction of heating cost but it also represents positive environmental impacts...|$|E
40|$|In the {{graduate}} thesis, {{we made a}} preposition of energetic renovation of an old homestead, which was built in 1869. A preliminary study was carried out to assess the situation. We took measurements of the building, which we have used {{in the preparation of}} plans and construction sets. With the help of the web site www. u-wert. net, we made an analysis of the energy balance. After the analysis of the current materials {{and with the help of}} the geometrical characteristics, we made an analysis of the energy performance. Energy performance calculations were carried out with the help of a software tool known as TOST, which is devoted to calculate energy balance of a building by PURES 2010, SIST EN ISO 13790 and TSG- 1 - 004 : 2010. The energy performance of the current situation was not appropriate, the results were expected. After the energy performance calculations, we made the analysis of insolation with software tool SketchUp LSS Chronolux. With its help we analysed the effects of insolation at chosen points on building envelope. After the analysis of insolation, we prepared a preposition of <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> of the old homestead. We carried out <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> with energy efficiency improvements and retained the current appearance of the homestead in the best possible way. We calculated the energy performance for two different modes – depending on the position of the thermal isolation within the exterior wall. With preposition of <b>energy</b> <b>renovation</b> we improved energy efficiency of the building. Energy performance of both cases – position of thermal isolation on the outside or on the inside was suitable, differnces were small - approximately ten percent...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{renovation}} (retrofit) {{of residential}} buildings {{is one of}} the major issues in the transition to a low-carbon energy system. This paper argues that the specific conditions in shrinking middle-size cities create an especially difficult environment for <b>energy</b> <b>renovations.</b> Using empirical data from the shrinking City of Delitzsch, Germany, it is hypothesized that buildings with poor energy efficiency are often inhabited by tenants or owners who impede retrofit activities due to their socio-economic conditions. The research analyzes the relation between buildings with a high potential for final energy reduction and a concentration of low-income, older or empty-nest households. The analysis examines this relation not only on an aggregated city level but also on the level of the city's districts to identify renovation âhot spotsâ in the city. Specific challenges are identified for building renovations in shrinking cities due to a high concentration of possible barriers in the relevant housing stock...|$|R

50|$|Cabin John {{underwent}} a complete renovation from 2009 to 2011. During the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years, students attended a holding school located on Tilden Lane in Rockville, Maryland. The new building is LEED certified as an environmentally friendly structure. It uses geothermal <b>energy.</b> The <b>renovation</b> had an {{estimated cost of}} about $48 million, and it included an asbestos-abatement program.|$|R
