40|$|Excessive {{bleeding}} (> 2 L) after {{cardiac surgery}} is encountered in 3 % to 7 % of patients (1), and necessitates reexploration in 3. 6 % (2) to 4. 2 % (3) of cases. A variety of hemostatic defects may contribute and are probably induced by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), i. e., impaired platelet function, thrombocytopenia, hyperfibrinolysis, heparin effect, protamine excess, and deficiencies of coagulation factors (4, 5). Platelet concentrates and plasma products, {{as well as}} drugs such as aprotinin and desmopressin, are administered to improve hemostasis. Nevertheless, excessive bleeding persists in some patients.

40|$|International audienceReplacement {{therapy for}} {{patients}} with hemophilia A using plasma-derived or recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) {{is complicated by the}} short half-life of the FVIII products and by the occurrence of neutralizing antibodies in a substantial number of patients. In the recent years, enormous efforts have been invested to develop new generations of coagulation factors with extended half-lives. Presumably, the use of long-lasting FVIII products should reduce the frequency of administration to the patients and drastically improve their quality of life. The question of their immunogenicity remains however unanswered as yet. The present review proposes a summary of the different strategies developed to enhance the half-life of FVIII, including fusion of FVIII to the Fc fragment of the human IgG 1 or to human serum albumin, or attachment of polyethylene glycol. Based on the available literature, we hypothesize on the potential benefits or risks associated with each of the latter strategies in terms of immunogenicity of the newly derived <b>hemostatic</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R

" The attempt of this paper is to present a case of massive postoperative clot formation after tooth extraction and highlight on the oral complications of {{surgical procedures}}. A 32 -year-old male patient reported to the Dental Clinic for evaluation and extraction of grossly decayed 46. Clinical evaluation of 46 revealed root stumps. Extraction of the root stumps was performed, and it was uneventful. Hemostasis was achieved and postsurgical instructions were specified to the patient. The patient reported to the clinic, the very subsequent morning with a criticism of bleeding at the extraction site. On clinical examination, bleeding was noted from the socket in relation to 46. To control bleeding, oral <b>hemostatic</b> <b>drugs</b> Revici - E (Ethamsylate 500 mg) was prescribed and bleeding was stopped in 2 h. However, a massive clot was formed at the extraction site. Further, this clot resolved on its own in 1 -week time.

We {{report on the}} feasibility of the management of bleeding at home in patients with haematological malignancies admitted in a domiciliary HC program. The occurrence of a major hemorrhage episode (1 WHO grade) was registered among 469 patients with hematological malignancies in the terminal phase of their disease followed at home. Number, sites, domiciliary treatment (local hemostatic measures, platelet units, <b>hemostatic</b> <b>drugs,</b> packed red blood cells) and outcome of hemorrhagic complications were evaluated. Out of 469 patients, 123 (26 %) experienced a bleeding complication; {{the overall number of}} hemorrhagic episodes was 232 (49 %) with a median number of 2 episodes per patient. Patients with a platelet count lower than 20109 /L (P 0. 00005) or with a diagnosis of acute leukemia or in blast crisis of myeloprolypherative disorders (P 0. 00005) showed a significant higher incidence of hemorrhages than other patients.

It is indicated as a support treatment in adult surgery to improve hemostasis, promote tissue sealing, and support sutures when standard surgical techniques are insufficient. This review systematically analyses the international scientific literature {{relating to the}} use of TachoSil in hemostasis and as a surgical sealant, {{from the point of view}} of its economic impact. Methods: We carried out a systematic review of the PubMed literature up to November 2013. Based on the selection criteria, papers were grouped according to the following outcomes: reduction of time to hemostasis; decrease in length of hospital stay; and decrease in postoperative complications. Results: Twenty-four scientific papers were screened, 13 (54 %) of which were randomized controlled trials and included a total of 2, 116 patients, 1, 055 of whom were treated with TachoSil. In the clinical studies carried out in patients undergoing hepatic, cardiac, or renal surgery, the time to hemostasis obtained with TachoSil was lower (1 – 4 minutes) than the time measured with other techniques and <b>hemostatic</b> <b>drugs,</b> with statistically significant differences. Moreover, in 13 of 15 studies, TachoSil showed a statistically significant reduction in postoperative complications in comparison with the standard surgical procedure. The range of the observed decrease in the length of hospital stay for TachoSil patients was 2. 01 – 3. 58 days versus standard techniques, with a statistically significant difference in favor of TachoSil in eight of 15 studies. Conclusion: This analysis shows that TachoSil has a role as a supportive treatment in surgery to improve hemostasis and promote tissue sealing when standard techniques are insufficient, with a consequent decrease in postoperative complications and hospital costs.

40|$|A {{foreseen}} {{conclusion of}} Wilhelmi’s paper is that prophylactic use of FFP {{not only does}} not reduce postoperative bleeding, but also increases transfusions of packed red cells, if compared with patients who received plasma expander, because of the different hemodilu-tional effect and colloid-osmotic properties of the two fluids. Another major criticism concerning Wilhelmi’s study is that the authors did not consider laboratory coagulation variables among the criteria for postoperative plasma transfusion, basing their deci-sion exclusively on a generic excessive postoperative bleeding. On the contrary, international guidelines suggest precise criteria for FFP transfusion [3]: microvascular bleeding or hemorrhage in patients who are massively transfused, and with a PT/PTT value exceeding 1. 5 times the laboratory normal values.

40|$|Background: Numerous {{animal studies}} have shown {{protective}} effects of hypothermia (HT) on hemorrhagic shock. These findings do not correlate with clinical findings, were studies on trauma registers have shown that HT is an independent factor of death when associated with trauma. HT affects hemostasis, but {{is just one of}} many factors that cause the coagulopathy often seen in trauma patients with uncontrolled bleedings. To what extent HT per se contributes to the hemorrhage and hence, the deterioration of shock is virtually unknown. In this thesis we investigate HTs impact on uncontrolled hemorrhage, but also if rebleeding volumes could be affected by <b>hemostatic</b> <b>drugs</b> or different resuscitation regimes. Methods: I: 18 pigs were randomized to HT (n = 10) or normothermia (NT) (n = 8). A volume controlled hemorrhagic shock was induced by a 40 % exsanguination of estimated blood volume (EBV). HT animals were cooled to 32. 5 degrees C and rewarmed again after 2 hours. The observation time (OT) was 420 minutes. II: 23 pigs were randomized to receive tranexamic acid (n = 11) or placebo (n = 12). Uncontrolled hemorrhage was induced by lacerating the aorta, producing an exsanguination estimated to 35 40 % of EBV. These animals were not actively cooled. Rebleeding events were monitored by ultrasonic probes. OT was 130 minutes. Thrombelastography (TEG) was used to evaluate coagulation changes in study I and II. III: 40 rats were randomized to HT (n = 20) or NT (n = 20). Uncontrolled hemorrhage was induced by puncturing the femoral artery, producing an exsanguination estimated to 24 % of EBV. HT animals were cooled to 30 degrees C and rewarmed again at 90 minutes. The incidence, on-set time, duration and volume of rebleedings were followed. OT was 180 minutes. IV: 60 rats, all cooled and processed according to the protocol of study III, were randomized to 3 different resuscitation groups; Low (LRe), Medium (MRe) or High (HRe) or Medium resuscitation +Desmopressin (MRe + D) (n = 4 x 15). Results: I: HT induced a coagulopathy apparent at temperatures 35 degrees C. Much higher blood pressure, induced by cooling, was seen in the HT group. IV: There were significantly higher rebleeding volumes in the HRe group and a trend towards higher mortality in the LRe group. No significant differences in the number or volume of rebleeding and no difference in mortality between the MRe + D and MRe groups was seen. Conclusions: HT induces a coagulopathy that is reversible upon rewarming. During trauma and uncontrolled hemorrhage, other factors than HT contribute to this coagulopathy. Hemodynamic changes provoked by cooling and HT, i. e. a rise in blood pressure, contribute to repeated rebleeding and hence, continuous hemorrhage. An MRe resuscitation regime seems most beneficial for outcome during HT and uncontrolled hemorrhage. Tranexamic acid at NT and desmopressin at HT conditions does not reduce rebleeding in penetrating trauma with uncontrolled hemorrhage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundIdentification of wound-specific markers would {{represent}} {{an important step}} toward damaged tissue detection and targeted delivery of biologically important materials to injured sites. Such delivery could minimize the amount of therapeutic materials that must be administered and limit potential collateral damage on nearby normal tissues. Yet, biological markers that are specific for injured tissue sites remain elusive. MethodsIn this study, we have developed an immunohistological approach for identification of protein epitopes specifically exposed in wounded tissue sites. ResultsUsing ex-vivo tissue samples in combination with fluorescently-labeled antibodies we show that actin, an intracellular cytoskeletal protein, is specifically exposed upon injury. The targetability of actin in injured sites has been demonstrated in vivo through the specific delivery of anti-actin conjugated particles to the wounded tissue in a lethal rat model of grade IV liver injury. ConclusionsThese results illustrate that identification of injury-specific protein markers and their targetability for specific delivery is feasible.

40|$|Keratinous {{materials}} such as wool, feathers and hooves are tough unique biological co-products that usually have high sulfur and protein contents. A high cystine content (7 – 13 %) differentiates keratins from other structural proteins, such as collagen and elastin. Dissolution and extraction of keratin is a difficult process compared to other natural polymers, such as chitosan, starch, collagen, and a large-scale use of keratin depends on employing a relatively fast, cost-effective and time efficient extraction method. Keratin has some inherent ability to facilitate cell adhesion, proliferation, and regeneration of the tissue, therefore keratin biomaterials can provide a biocompatible matrix for regrowth and regeneration of the defective tissue. Additionally, due to its amino acid constituents, keratin can be tailored and finely tuned to meet the exact requirement of degradation, drug release or incorporation of different hydrophobic or hydrophilic tails. This review discusses the various methods available for the dissolution and extraction of keratin with emphasis on their advantages and limitations. The impacts of various methods and chemicals used on the structure and the properties of keratin are discussed {{with the aim of}} highlighting options available toward commercial keratin production. This review also reports the properties of various keratinbased biomaterials and critically examines how these materials are influenced by the keratin extraction procedure, discussing the features that make them effective as biomedical applications, {{as well as some of}} the mechanisms of action and physiological roles of keratin.

40|$|Plants {{and their}} exudates are used {{worldwide}} {{for the treatment}} of several diseases and novel drugs continue to be developed through phytochemical research. There are more than 20, 000 species of high vegetables, used in traditional medicines that are sources of potential new drugs. Following the modern medicine and drug research advancing, chemically synthesized drugs have replaced plants as the source of most medicinal agents in industrialized countries. However, in developing countries, the majority of the world’s population cannot afford pharmaceutical drugs and use their own plant based indigenous medicines. Several exudates from plants are well-known in folk medicine since ancient time, and they are today employed also for practical uses. Dragon’s blood is a deep red resin, which {{has been used as a}} famous traditional medicine since ancient times by many cultures. Dragon's blood is a non-specific name for red resinous exudations from quite different plant species endemic to various regions around the globe that belong to the genera Dracaena (Africa) and Daemonorops (South-East Asia), more rarely also to the genera Pterocarpus and Croton (both South America). Dracaena draco L. is known as the dragon’s blood tree, and it’s endemic to the Canary Islands and Morocco. Phytochemical studies of resins obtained from incisions of the trunk of D. draco, have led to the isolation of flavans, along with homoisoflavans, homoisoflavones, chalcones and dihydrochalcones. Dragon’s blood has been used for diverse medical applications in folk medicine and artistic uses. It has astringent effect and has been used as a <b>hemostatic</b> and antidiarrhetic <b>drug.</b> Frankincense, also known as Olibanum, is an old-known oleogum resin obtained from the bark of trees belonging to the genera Boswellia. There are 43 different reported species in India, Arabian Peninsula and North Africa. The importance of these plants is related to the use of extracts and essential oils of resin in traditional medicine like Ayurvedic and Chinese. Extracts from B. serrata resin are currently used in India {{for the treatment of}} rheumatic diseases and ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, extracts and essential oils of frankincense have been used as antiseptic agents in mouthwash, in the treatment of cough and asthma and as a fixative in perfumes, soaps, creams, lotions and detergents. In ancient Egypt the resin was used in mummification balms and unguents. Today frankincense is one of the most commonly used resins in aromatherapy. The biological activity of frankincense resins is due to the pentacyclic triterpenic acids, α- and β- boswellic acids and their derivatives, which showed a well documented anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Manna is an exudate from the bark of Fraxinus trees (Oleaceae). Originally it was only collected from trees with damaged bark, but later in southern Italy and northern Sicily plantations were established for manna production, in which the bark is intentionally damaged for exudation and collection of manna. In July-August a vertical series of oblique incisions are made in the bark on alternate sides of the trunk. A glutinous liquid exudes from this cut, hardens as it oxidises in the air into a yellowish crystalline mass with a bittersweet taste, and is then harvested. Manna is still produced in Sicily, mainly in the Castelbuono and Pollina areas, from Fraxinus ornus and Fraxinus angustifolia trees. The main component of manna is mannitol; it also contains glucose, fructose, maltotriose, mannotetrose, minerals and some unknown constituents. Manna is a mild laxative and an excellent purgative, it is suitable in cases of digestive problems, in atonic or spastic constipation. It’s useful as expectorant, fluidifier, emollient and sedative in coughs; as a decongestant in chronic bronchitis, laryngitis and tonsillitis; in hypertonic solutions it acts as a dehydrating agent in the treatment of wounds and ulcers. It can be used as a sweetener in cases of diabetes as it does not affect glycemia levels or cause glycosuria; in addition it is also a cholagogue as it promotes the flow of the contents of the gall bladder and bile ducts and so stimulates bile production...|$|R
