40|$|With {{the passage}} of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA), {{existing}} programs for expedited development and approval for treatments of serious or life-threatening diseases were codified and consolidated under the administrative rubric of fast track product designation. The four basic programs available with fast track designation have been categorized by FDA as consisting of meetings, written correspon-dence, review programs, and dispute resolution. Despite some early skepticism by industry, and even FDA, that the benefits of designation were not readily apparent since the individual programs are generally available without designation, there are indications that fast track designation will be the improvement Congress intended. Unlike the individual expedited development and approval programs, which affect only part of the drug develop-ment timeline, fast track designation has the potential to facilitate the entire process. Industry requests for fast track designation have dwarjed pre-FDAMA industry participa-tion. Yet, the best predictor of the future success or failure of fast track designation is how well it is working now. In order to evaluate this, the authors surveyed the biotechnol-ogy and pharmaceutical sponsors of 32 fast track <b>designated</b> <b>products</b> identified from public information sources and present their findings in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{high-temperature}} production (HTP) regulon of Escherichia coli {{consists of}} a set of operons that are induced coordinately by a shift to a high temperature under the control of a single chromosomal gene called htpR or hin. To identify more components of this regulon, the rates of synthesis of many polypeptides resolved on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels were measured in various strains by pulse-labeling after a temperature shift-up. A total of 13 polypeptides were found to be heat inducible only in cells bearing a normal htpR gene on the chromosome or on a plasmid; on this basis these polypeptides were <b>designated</b> <b>products</b> of the HTP regulon. Several hybrid plasmids that contain segments of the E. coli chromosome in the 75 -min region were found to carry the htpR gene. A restriction map of this region was constructed, and selected fragments were subcloned and tested for the ability to complement an htpR mutant. The polypeptides encoded by these fragments were detected by permitting expression in maxicells, minicells, and chloramphenicol-treated cells. Complementation was accompanied by production of a polypeptide having a molecular weight of approximately 33, 000. This polypeptide, designated F 33. 4, was markedly reduced in amount in an htpR mutant expected to contain very little htpR gene product. Polypeptide F 33. 4 is postulated to be the product of htpR and to be an effector that controls heat induction of the HTP regulon...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2006. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) {{was signed}} into law in May 2000 by President Clinton to allow sub-Saharan {{countries}} to export <b>designated</b> <b>products</b> duty-free into the US. AGOA is a temporary measure that is non-reciprocal and not negotiated by the participating parties. The initiative was launched to liberalise the markets of developing countries on the road to become integrated in the global economy. The initial success of AGOA was limited, with only a few countries making use of AGOA to increase their exports into the US markets. Problems encountered were high levels of protectionism from the US and the existence of technical trade barriers (including sanitary measures in agriculture) and nontariff barriers (including quotas). African countries are using shipment as the main transport for exports, and the US barred transshipment due to corruption that occurred in the past. The AGOA also made provision for 'special provisions' measures to enable AGOA eligible countries to export apparel and textile to the US. The export of apparel was very successful until the Multifibre Agreement expired in 2005, leading to relocation of apparel factories to lower cost bases. The real beneficiaries from AGOA are oil-exporting countries that make up more than 90 % of total AGOA benefits. South Africa is the only country who succeeded in diversified AGOA exports. AGOA has been supplemented by AGOA II (extending the product range) and AGOA III (extending the expiry date to 2015). After the EU-SA Free Trade Agreement has been concluded in 1999, the US started with FTA negotiations with the South African Customs Union (SACU) to improve the exposure of US products to the SACU market and to decrease the trade deficit. However, the agenda of the FTA negotiations included second generation issues of intellectual property rights, trade in services, investment and government procurement. The SACU negotiators learnt some lessons from the EU-SA FTA and progress was slow. The extension of AGOA to 2015 saw a decrease in the urgency of striking a SACU-US FTA. Negotiations slowed down and the decision was made in April 2006 to conduct talks on a lower level. This breathing time can be used by the SACU negotiators to develop an aggressive offensive strategy for future negotiations, and to build competency against the efficient and offensive US negotiators. The US-SACU FTA must still be pursued to ensure that the benefits of AGOA are locked in. It will be beneficial for SACU if the different needs for all the SACU countries are addressed and the negotiations are done in incremental steps...|$|E
40|$|Class of 2007 AbstractObjectives: In {{this paper}} we {{analyzed}} {{the time frame}} for oncology drugs that were designated as a fast track drug and the time transition from a phase II to phase III clinical trial completion. Methods In our study we utilized oncology drugs that were approved between the years of 2000 - 2006 (FDA. gov). We then analyzed the CDER data base that provided information to Fast Track drugs that have been approved within the time period {{as determined by the}} FDA selection criteria (21 CFR 312. 81 (a)). Under certain circumstances, the FCA may consider reviewing portions of a marketing application in advance of the complete New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologic License Application (BLA). We will evaluate fast track <b>designated</b> <b>products</b> which may also be eligible to participate in FDA’s Continuous Marketing Applications Pilot 1 or Pilot 2 programs. For our analysis, we specifically selected oncology drugs. In particular, we analyzed 32 drugs from the stated time period. Each fast track drug was then selected and analyzed for its clinical phase development time period based on news announcements during clinical trails. For each announcement we conducted an event study analysis through lexis Nexus with respect to the announcement of a clinical trial enrollment, clinical trials news (Phase I, II, III). Results: The results of our preliminary study show that there was a shorter time to development transition for the fast track oncology drugs. The oncology clinical phase transition from II to three on average lasted 12 months with a range of 2 - 29 months The average length of the phase development had to excludes 4 drugs {{due to the lack of}} information provided from the LexisNexis database. The current timeline for fats track drugs has shown a decrease in transition from clinical trials to the market. In the example of Spyrcel, the data from our study had to be excluded, there was a definitive difference in the time to approval process for the drug as compared to other standard review entities. The approvals for dasatinib, or Sprycel, for refractory CML was shown to move through the development to approval in one of the fastest timeframes in modern development. Since its first clinical study on in Gleevec-resistant patients, the medication was decided on entering an accelerated timeline. It took us just 25 months to bring Sprycel from first-in-human dosing to a regulatory submission. In contrast, the industry average for this cycle time is 6. 4 years which is three times greater than the cycle time for Sprycel. Conclusions: The new Subpart H regulations state that post-marketing studies to confirm clinical benefit that would consist usually by "studies underway” at the time of accelerated approval, this has not always been the case and is not a requirement (Dagher R, Johnson J, Williams G et al). In conclusion, the accelerated approval program in oncology has been successful in making 18 different products available to patients for 22 different cancer treatment indications since the inception of the fast track program. From the current data and transition information, there is a comparative difference between the clinical phase transitions from phase II to Phase III clinical trials. However, this preliminary data needs to be further evaluated against the standard FDA review process from oncology drugs. Moreover, further studies will be needed to interpret whether the average length of oncology studies biases the value of our study...|$|E
