5|$|A second variant on the Tetrarch {{design was}} the Tetrarch <b>Duplex</b> Drive ("Tetrarch DD"). The <b>Duplex</b> Drive system {{was invented by}} Nicholas Straussler, and was {{designed}} to allow a tank to 'swim' through water and participate in amphibious operations. The system functioned by erecting a large waterproof canvas screen around the tank above its tracks, which was supported by thirty-six inflatable tubes and steel struts; this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float, and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank's engine. The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land. The system was fitted during June 1941, as the Tetrarch was the lightest light tank available at the time; the converted tank was successfully tested {{on a number of}} lakes and reservoirs, allowing the <b>Duplex</b> Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks, such as the Valentine. The system would be used during Operation Overlord, when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches.|$|E
5|$|Route markers {{were first}} {{introduced}} in Australia in late 1954. Over the following decades they were progressively rolled {{out to the}} various highways around the nation, under a nationwide route numbering scheme. Previous to the NSW conversion to alphanumeric routes in 2013, the highway was signed as National Route 18 shield along its entire length. In addition to this, {{the section of the}} Monaro Highway between Cooma and Steeple Flat was also signed the National Route 18 shield in addition to the National Route 23 route marker used along the remainder of its length within NSW; this kind of arrangement is known as a <b>duplex</b> or concurrency. This allowed one route to cover the highway from end to end. The Snowy Mountains Highway was allocated the alphanumeric route B72 as part of New South Wales' 2013 conversion. The route <b>duplex</b> along the Monaro Highway remains intact with B72 used in addition to B23 between Cooma and Steeple Flat.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} currently {{does not}} have a route marker. There is a <b>duplex</b> along the highway where it additionally carries the B72 route marker between the two sections of the Snowy Mountains Highway. Within the ACT, a section of the road is also part of Tourist Drive 5.|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{stability}} of DNA <b>duplexes</b> containing deoxyinosine in a pairing position in turn {{with each of}} the four major deoxynucleotides has been investigated by measuring ultraviolet-absorbance at different temperatures. d(G 2 A 4 X A 4 G 2) and d(C 2 T 4 YT 4 C 2) were prepared by the solid-phase phosphotriester method. When X is deoxyinosine, the Tm values of the <b>duplexes</b> are in the order Y = dC greater than dA greater than dG greater than dT greater than dU. The Tm of other <b>duplexes</b> containing dG, dA and dT at X were also measured. Self-complementary <b>duplexes</b> d(GGGAAINTTCCC) showed the same order of stability with N being dC, dA, dG and dT. Thermal stabilities of <b>duplexes</b> containing dG instead of dI were compared with other matched and mismatched <b>duplexes.</b> The Tm values of sequence isomers containing purine-pyrimidine combinations were compared. Self-complementary <b>duplexes</b> containing G-C and A-T in the central positions showed Tm values ca. 10 degrees higher than those containing C-G and T-A in the same positions. Thermodynamic parameters and circular dichroism spectra of these oligonucleotides were compared...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} stability of RNA <b>duplexes</b> were determined in both solution and gas phase. Solution stability {{as determined by}} a spectrophotometric method indicated that the Watson-Crick <b>duplexes</b> were more stable than <b>duplexes</b> containing one GA mismatch or two tandem GA mismatches. Gas phase stability was determined using ESI-MS through variation of the collision energy in an ion trap. Stability curves similar to the melting curves obtained in solution were observed. The {{relative stability}} in gas phase differed, however, from that in solution. The <b>duplexes</b> with two tandem GA mismatches {{were found to be}} more stable than the Watson-Crick and single GA mismatch <b>duplexes.</b> The different trends observed in solution versus gas phase {{can be attributed to the}} primary means of interaction. In solution, stacking is expected to be the dominant interaction mode. In the gas phase, hydrogen bonding is expected to be the dominant interaction mode. <b>Duplexes</b> with tandem GA mismatches have the potential to undergo additional hydrogen bonding relative to the other <b>duplexes</b> which could account for their increased stability in the gas phase...|$|R
40|$|Small interfering RNA (siRNA) <b>duplexes</b> {{are short}} (usually 21 to 24 bp) {{double-stranded}} RNAs (dsRNAs) with several overhanging nucleotides at both 5 '- and 3 '-ends. It {{has been found}} that siRNA <b>duplexes</b> bind the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and cleave the sense strands with endonucleases. In this study, for the first time, we detected siRNA <b>duplexes</b> induced by plant viruses on a large scale using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. In addition, we used the detected 21 nucleotide (nt) siRNA <b>duplexes</b> with 2 nt overhangs to construct a dataset for future data mining. The analytical results of the features in the detected siRNA <b>duplexes</b> were consistent with those from previous studies. The investigation of siRNA <b>duplexes</b> is useful for {{a better understanding of the}} RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism.

5|$|After {{leaving the}} D-League, Clinkscales signed in 2013 with the Panama City Breeze of the semi-professional American Basketball League (ABL), with no {{indication}} that he joined any other team since his tenure with the BayHawks. On February 16, 2013, he scored 12 points with two three-pointers in a loss to the Emerald Coast Knights. While with the Breeze, Clinkscales (and his teammates) endured financial and domestic difficulties. He lived with five other teammates in a <b>duplex</b> house in Bay County, Florida. Because of financial issues, the league failed to pay the players—with Clinkscales solely receiving a check of $400—and canceled several games on its schedule. Later in the season, the players' <b>duplex</b> was supposedly leased by Breeze's head coach, Ty Fisher. A local broker filed a civil lawsuit against Fisher to evict the players, and county sheriff deputies soon forced them to leave the house. While living in the area, the players received aid from a local resident, Vonda Gainer, who they met at a Dollar Tree store. Gainer gave them food and washed their clothes. Despite their poor living conditions, the players failed to receive any aid by the league, with no contact or assurance from league CEO Steve Haney.|$|E

Lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a <b>duplex</b> uterus and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade Glires. Anteaters of the family myrmecophagidae are unusual in that they lack a defined cervix; they {{are thought to have}} lost the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix on more than one lineage.|$|E

40|$|Studies on {{hydration}} {{are important}} for better understanding of structure and function of nucleic acids. We compared the hydration of self-complementary DNA, RNA and 2 ′-O-methyl (2 ′-OMe) oligonucleotides GCGAAUUCGC, (UA) 6 and (CG) 3 using the osmotic stressing method. The number of water molecules released upon melting of oligonucleotide <b>duplexes,</b> ΔnW, was calculated from the dependence of melting temperature on water activity and the enthalpy, both measured with UV thermal melting experiments. The water activity was changed by addition of ethylene glycol, glycerol and acetamide as small organic co-solutes. The ΔnW was 3 – 4 for RNA <b>duplexes</b> and 2 – 3 for DNA and 2 ′-OMe <b>duplexes.</b> Thus, the RNA <b>duplexes</b> were hydrated more than the DNA and the 2 ′-OMe oligonucleotide <b>duplexes</b> by approximately one to two water molecules depending on the sequence. Consistent with previous studies, GC base pairs were hydrated more than AU pairs in RNA, whereas in DNA and 2 ′-OMe oligonucleotides the difference in hydration between these two base pairs was relatively small. Our {{data suggest that the}} better hydration of RNA contributes to the increased enthalpic stability of RNA <b>duplexes</b> compared with DNA <b>duplexes...</b>|$|R
