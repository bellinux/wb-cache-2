40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> security {{from the}} perspective of computer science and cryptology. We focus on new and practical attacks for amplifying rights in <b>mechanical</b> pin tumbler <b>locks.</b> Given access to a single master-keyed lock and its associated key, a procedure is given that allows discovery and creation of a working master key for the system. No special skill or equipment, beyond a small number of blank keys and a metal file, is required, and the attacker need engage in no suspicious behavior at the lock’s location. Countermeasures are also described that may provide limited protection under certain circumstances. We conclude with directions for research in this area and the suggestion that <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> are worthy objects for study and scrutiny. ...|$|R

50|$|Physical {{access control}} {{is a matter of}} who, where, and when. An access control system determines who is allowed to enter or exit, where they are allowed to exit or enter, and when they are allowed to enter or exit. Historically, this was {{partially}} accomplished through keys and locks. When a door is locked, only someone with a key can enter through the door, depending on how the <b>lock</b> is configured. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> and keys do not allow restriction of the key holder to specific times or dates. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> and keys do not provide records of the key used on any specific door, and the keys can be easily copied or transferred to an unauthorized person. When a mechanical key is lost or the key holder is no longer authorized to use the protected area, the locks must be re-keyed.|$|R

40|$|Following {{testing methods}} have been {{compared}} and their response assessed to parameter changes {{in the process of}} plasma spraying and substrate pretreatment: Pull-off-test, hardness-indentation-test, shear test, and fracture mechanics by 4 -point-bend test and double- torsion-test. Different effects on the adhesion properties like <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking,</b> physical bonding forces, residual stress enter the test results in a different way. Thus the results prove, that the shear test is revealing the effect of <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> of coating material with the roughened substrate surface better, while the interfacial hardness indentation test is more sensitive to the physical bonding forces between coating and substrate. Between those two methods the pull-off test takes an intermediate position. Both the 4 -point-bend test and the double torsion test arrangement don't give an unimbigous decision, whether the cohesive or the adhesive strength has been measured, because the fraction course run near the interface in the coating materia...|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic-set packers use fluid {{pressure}} {{to drive the}} cone behind the slips. Once set they remain set {{by the use of}} either entrapped pressure or a <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock.</b> They are released by picking up the tubing. They are good for used in deviated or crooked holes where tubing movement is restricted or unwanted. The tubing can be hung in neutral tension.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} bearing had a long keyed sleeve and a Threaded Ring (TR) lock. This was the typical design through the 1950s when the Quick-Change (QC) <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> was introduced. Short-key and keyless KL® bearings were introduced in the late 1970s to reduce roll force variation and allow the mill operators to produce a higher quality product.|$|R
50|$|ZF is the {{original}} product line. ZF.2 lenses are CPU-enabled (similar to Nikon AI-P lenses) offering full metering compatibility with {{the full range of}} AF Nikon SLR cameras. ZF-I lenses add <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> for focus and aperture, and additional environmental sealing, for industrial applications. ZF-IR lenses are adapted to infrared imaging, with coatings that transmit wavelengths up to 1100 nm, and focus scales marked for infrared.|$|R
50|$|ControlTrac II {{has since}} been {{replaced}} by the automatic Intelligent four-wheel drive system, a similar system with the viscous coupling replaced by a computer controlled clutch. The Intelligent 4WD system functionally acts similar to the ControlTrac II system, with the front wheels being driven predominately with torque being sent to the rear wheels only as conditions dictate. The Intelligent 4WD system also lacks the <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> provided by ControlTrac II.|$|R
50|$|Railway {{interlocking}} is of British origin, where numerous patents were granted. In June 1856, John Saxby {{received the}} first patent for interlocking switches and signals. In 1868, Saxby (of Saxby & Farmer) {{was awarded a}} patent for what is known today in North America as “preliminary latch locking”. Preliminary latch locking became so successful that by 1873, 13,000 <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> levers were employed on the London and North Western Railway alone.|$|R
50|$|The third {{component}} in SIPs is the spline or connector piece between SIP panels. Dimensional lumber {{is commonly used}} but creates thermal bridging and lowers insulation values. To maintain higher insulation values through the spline, manufacturers use Insulated Lumber, Composite Splines, <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Locks,</b> Overlapping OSB Panels, or other creative methods. Depending on the method selected, other advantages such as full nailing surfaces or increased structural strength may become available.|$|R
5000|$|Strike plate - A {{plate with}} a hole in the middle made to receive a bolt. If the strike is for a latchbolt, it {{typically}} also includes a small ramped area to help the bolt move inward while the door is being closed.

50|$|Early {{firearms}} were muzzle-loading, with powder, {{and then}} shot loaded from the muzzle, capable {{of only a}} low rate of fire. Breech loading provided {{a higher rate of}} fire, but early breech-loading guns lacked an effective way of sealing the escaping gases that leaked from the back end of the barrel, reducing the available muzzle velocity. During the 19th century effective <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> were invented that sealed a breech-loading weapon against the escape of propellant gases.|$|R
50|$|A smart gun, or {{personalized}} gun, is {{a firearm}} {{that includes a}} safety feature or features that allow it to fire only when activated by an authorized user. These safety features can prevent misuse, accidental shootings, gun thefts, {{and use of the}} weapon against the owner. Smart guns distinguish between authorized users and unauthorized users in several different ways, including the use of RFID chips or other proximity tokens, fingerprint recognition, magnetic rings, or <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks.</b> Related to smart guns are other smart firearms safety devices such as biometric or RFID activated accessories and safes.|$|R
50|$|Electric mortise and {{cylindrical}} locks are drop-in {{replacements for}} door-mounted <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks.</b> An additional hole must be drilled {{in the door}} for electric power wires. Also, a power transfer hinge {{is often used to}} get the power from the door frame to the door. Electric mortise and cylindrical <b>locks</b> allow <b>mechanical</b> free egress, and can be either fail unlocked or fail locked. In the US, UL rated doors must retain their rating: in new construction doors are cored and then rated. but in retrofits, the doors must be re-rated.|$|R
50|$|Electronic {{access control}} uses {{computers}} {{to solve the}} limitations of <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> and keys. A wide range of credentials {{can be used to}} replace mechanical keys. The electronic access control system grants access based on the credential presented. When access is granted, the door is unlocked for a predetermined time and the transaction is recorded. When access is refused, the door remains locked and the attempted access is recorded. The system will also monitor the door and alarm if the door is forced open or held open too long after being unlocked.|$|R
50|$|ControlTrac II was a Ford {{four-wheel drive}} {{system based on}} a viscous {{coupling}} unit. The viscous coupling replaced the typical center differential used in four-wheel drive applications. The system worked normally in front wheel drive {{but in addition to}} the front wheels being driven, a shaft is powered that runs to the viscous coupling in the rear. If the front wheels slip, the viscous coupling progressively releases torque to the rear wheels. Additionally, the ControlTrac II system provided a <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> of four-wheel drive though there was no low range provided by the system.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new joining by forming process for fixing {{longitudinally}} in position two metal sheets (or plates) perpendicular to one another, at room temperature. The proposed process employs a counterbored {{variant of the}} ‘mortise-and-tenon’ joint that eliminates the protrusion of the tenon beyond the mortise after <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> by plastic deformation. The presentation draws from the workability limits and material stress-strain characterization to validation by joining and destructive pull-out testing. Results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} new proposed process for producing flat joint surfaces, which are advantageous over typical ‘mortise-and-tenon’ protruded surfaces in most applications. info:eu-repo/semantics/acceptedVersio...|$|R
