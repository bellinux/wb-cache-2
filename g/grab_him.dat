5|$|In some legends, Marko's wonder {{horse was}} a gift from a vila. A Serbian story says that {{he was looking for a}} horse who could bear him. To test a steed, he would <b>grab</b> <b>him</b> by the tail and sling him over his shoulder. Seeing a diseased piebald foal owned by some carters, Marko grabbed him by the tail but could not move him. He bought (and cured) the foal, naming him Šarac. He became an {{enormously}} powerful horse and Marko's inseparable companion. Macedonian legend has it that Marko, following a vilas advice, captured a sick horse on a mountain and cured him. Crusted patches on the horse's skin grew white hairs, and he became a piebald.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Irwin {{appeared}} in a cameo role in the Eddie Murphy film Dr. Dolittle 2, in which an alligator warns Dolittle that he knows Irwin is going to <b>grab</b> <b>him</b> and is prepared to attack when he does, but Dolittle fails to warn Irwin in time. Irwin's only starring feature film role was in 2002's , which was released to mixed reviews. In the film Irwin (who portrayed himself and performed numerous stunts) mistakes some CIA agents for poachers. He sets out {{to stop them from}} capturing a crocodile, which, unknown to him, has actually swallowed a tracking transmitter. The film won the Best Family Feature Film award for a comedy film at the Young Artist Awards. The film was produced on a budget of about US$12million, and has grossed $33million. To promote the film, Irwin was featured in an animated short produced by Animax Entertainment for Intermix.|$|E
5|$|There were daily {{clashes between}} American and Japanese patrols. The most {{significant}} occurred on 28 January. A patrol from the 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry Regiment led by First Lieutenants George J. Hess and James E. Barnett, with 48 enlisted men, {{set out to}} reconnoitre the area around Cape Iris. The patrol initially moved parallel to the coast, but {{near the village of}} Teterei it changed direction and headed towards the beach. On reaching it, the patrol was attacked by the Japanese. It attempted to withdraw along the beach, but found it blocked and was forced to return to the beach near Teterei. The patrol then divided into three groups, which attempted to make their way back through the jungle. The groups under Barnett and Sergeant Aaron Meyers made it to the American lines. The one under Hess reached the Mot River, but were unable to cross due to the swift current. Meyers informed the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Gordon M. Clarkson, of the situation, and they quickly assembled a party to go to Hess's aid. They reached the river as Hess was attempting to swim across with a rope, but was being swept downstream, and formed a human chain to <b>grab</b> <b>him.</b> At that point, a Japanese machine gun opened fire on the rescue party, killing Staff Sergeant Victor L. Olson and fatally wounding Clarkson. Sergeant Thomas Reed managed to drag Clarkson away, but he died soon after. The rescue party was forced to withdraw. Eight of the 14 men in Hess's group, including Hess, were able to reach American lines during the night. Eight Americans were killed, including Clarkson, nine were wounded and six were missing, none of whom was seen alive again; 43 Japanese were reported killed. For this action, four men were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, including Hess and, posthumously, Clarkson, and ten received the Silver Star.|$|E

25|$|De Kock, the captor, {{stands to}} Diponegoro's left, {{at the same}} level as the guerrilla. Further to the left are various Dutch officers, {{identified}} by the historian and Diponegoro biographer Peter Carey as Colonel Louis du Perr, Lieutenant-Colonel W.A. Roest, and Major-Adjutant Francois Victor Henri Antoine Ridder de Stuer. To the prince's right stands a Javanese man identified by Carey as Diponegoro's son, Diponegoro the Younger, followed by Resident of Kedu Franciscus Gerardus Valck, Major Johan Jacob Perié, and Captain Johan Jacob Roeps.

25|$|In 1985, Dr. Humberto Alvarez-Machain, a Mexican national, {{allegedly}} {{assisted in}} the torture and murder of a U.S. DEA agent in Mexico. Notwithstanding that the U.S had an extradition treaty with Mexico (and because the Mexican government declined to extradite a Mexican national to the U.S. for a crime allegedly committed in Mexico), the U.S. Government hired a private citizen and some Mexican nationals to essentially act as mercenaries, who then went into Mexico, kidnapped Dr. Alvarez-Machain, and {{brought him back to}} the U.S. for trial for the crime committed in Mexico. The trial court ruled that since Alvarez-Machain had been brought to the U.S. in violation of the treaty, his arrest was unlawful. The United States Supreme Court, in United States v. Alvarez-Machain, ruled that notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty with Mexico, it was still legal for the U.S. government to exercise self-help and essentially <b>grab</b> <b>him</b> off the street in Mexico ("forcible abduction") to bring him back to the U.S. for trial. In Alvarez-Machain's subsequent criminal trial, he was acquitted, and he lost a civil suit he filed for false arrest against the government.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Compton was out hit wicket for 184 when {{he tried}} unsuccessfully to avoid a bouncer from Miller. Fingleton {{described}} the dismissal as [...] "a most depressing end to an innings that will live always". Australia quickly finished off the hosts' innings; Miller bowled Laker for four, before England reached 441, leaving Australia with a victory target of 98 in three hours. Miller ended with 4/125 for the innings and 7/163 for the match, having removed England's two leading batsmen in both innings and bowled 63overs—more than his usual workload—because Lindwall was injured. As the players were {{walking back to the}} pavilion after England's innings, Miller received another hostile reception. One spectator threatened him with violence, prompting the Australian to <b>grab</b> <b>him</b> by his coat collar, challenging him to enter the Australian dressing room. The spectator declined. Miller was not required to bat as Australia went on to win by eight wickets.|$|E
500|$|The game {{occasionally}} {{shifts to}} an icy alternate dimension called [...] "Nightmare", where hostile monsters exist. To escape from this dimension, Harry {{must find a}} predetermined exit while avoiding the wandering creatures which chase him upon detection. Unlike previous installments in the series, there is no combat element to the gameplay: Harry is weaponless for the entire duration {{of the game and}} can only run, hide, slow down the monsters by knocking down objects to block their path, throw off the creatures if they latch onto him, and temporarily ward them off by picking up and using flares found lying on the ground. His running speed and [...] "health" [...] (the amount of damage that he can endure before dying) decrease every time the monsters <b>grab</b> <b>him.</b> In contrast to the previous installments of the series, which featured various types of monsters, Shattered Memories features only one type of humanoid monster, whose physical appearance changes in response to the player's actions inside and outside the Nightmare realm, including their responses to Kaufmann's psychological tests.|$|E

500|$|Emma {{opens the}} gateway and the Doctor travels through where {{he finds himself}} on a small island of land {{floating}} in a void. He finds Hila and they are drawn to a vision of Caliburn House that Emma has generated for them as a beacon. At the same time, a creature follows them and chases them into the house. The Doctor locks the doors to slow the creature down, and Hila uses the harness {{to return to the}} normal world. [...] The strain of keeping the gateway open causes Emma to collapse and the gateway closes, trapping the Doctor in the pocket universe. The TARDIS's cloister bell begins to sound, and Clara races to the TARDIS to find it locked. She pleads with the device via its holographic voice interface to help her save the Doctor, and after initially refusing the TARDIS finally opens up and allows Clara in. As Emma reopens the gateway again with Palmer's encouragement, the TARDIS briefly flies into the pocket universe and moves close to the ground, allowing the Doctor to jump and hang on before the creature can <b>grab</b> <b>him.</b> The Doctor and the TARDIS safely reappear in the normal world as Emma collapses from the pain and exhaustion.|$|E
500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and <b>grab</b> <b>him</b> and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E

Hobson's men managed to <b>grab</b> <b>him,</b> but Epenow being [...] "a strong and heavy man" [...] managed to dive overboard under cover of arrows shot from the canoes. Both sides took heavy casualties; Hobson's musketeers killed and wounded some, and Hobson {{and many of his}} crew were injured in the battle. They returned to England empty handed.|$|E

2500|$|Arthur Gies, {{writing for}} Polygon, wrote that 343 Industries {{had much to}} prove with Halo 5 after Halo 4s online {{population}} [...] "evaporated", The Master Chief Collections woes, and Microsoft's need for a strong title to sell more Xbox Ones. [...] "343's response to that quagmire," [...] Gies wrote, [...] " [...] {{to return to the}} fundamentals of what made the series great in the first place. The studio has brought Halos mechanics kicking and screaming into the modern era, while providing the most bombastic, co-op-driven campaign in Halo history." [...] GameSpots Mike Mahardy agreed that 343 had produced some of the best iterations of the game series' facets with Halo 5. IGN's Brian Albert opined that 343 Industries had created an even bigger game than previous entries, with [...] "the strongest combat Halo has ever seen". Destructoids Chris Carter felt that Halo 5 failed to <b>grab</b> <b>him</b> {{in the same way as}} previous games had, [...] "but those of you who are still content with Master Chief and his wacky adventures across the galaxy will likely walk away satisfied." [...] More critically, the reviewers of GamesTM felt that Halo 5 was [...] "sheepish and safe" [...] and represented a series low.|$|E
