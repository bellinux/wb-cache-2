40|$|Marking the 30 th {{anniversary of}} the {{formation}} of Orion Bank in 1970, financial historian Richard Roberts has written a history of Orion and the rise and decline of the consortium banking movement. Consortium banks were formed as joint ventures to enable banks to operate in the booming <b>Euromarkets,</b> with virtually every major international bank participating in a consortium bank during their heyday in the 1970 s and 1980 s. Orion Bank was one of the leading players in the <b>Euromarkets</b> in those decades: its shareholders were six of the biggest banks in the world from the three major trading blocks: Chase Manhattan, Royal Bank of Canada, NatWest, Westdeutsche Landesbank, Credito Italiano and Mitsubishi Bank. Like other consortiums banks, Orion Bank was prominent in Eurocurrency syndicated lending, but more unusually, it was also a top Eurobond lead manager. The story of Orion exemplifies the tensions inherent in the joint venture approach to business development and the strategic dilemmas facing consortium bank managements and shareholders. Richard Roberts uses primary archival papers and interviews with former Orion executives and other bankers prominent in consortium and investment banking to present an authoritative case study with great topical relevance as today's European banking industry continues to integrate across borders.

5000|$|The government's {{economic}} policy {{tried to make}} up for the loss of jobs in heavy industry through growth in other sectors, especially the services sector. Important legislative and regulatory measures supported the development and diversification of financial activities. In 1979, a government commission was set up to study the improvement of the legislative infrastructure of the financial centre. The law of 23 April 1981 enshrined banking secrecy. Bankers were now subject to the same confidentiality that applied to certain professions, such as doctors or midwives. Disclosure of confidential information was considered a crime punishable by prison or a fine. The law of 25 August 1983 on investment companies created a legal framework for investment funds and gave them a specific tax status. It created a new form of entity: the Société d’investissement à capital variable (SICAV). While the development of the <b>Euromarket</b> was at the basis of the boom of the financial centre in the 1970s, private banking and off-balance-sheet operations generating commissions took the lead during the 1980s. The financial sector became the engine of growth after the steel crisis. The number of banks grew relatively slowly: 143 banks in 1988, compared with 111 in 1980. But the number of investment funds exploded. In 1980, 76 investment funds represented global net assets of 118 billion francs. In 1988, 473 entities represented holdings equivalent to 1,668 billion francs. The Luxembourgish government certainly benefited from the tax obstacles - especially the withholding tax - encountered by this type of companies in their countries of origin. However, the financial centre's success was also based on a skilful niche policy which required flexibility and quick decision-making.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{develops}} a model where service buyer loyalty {{can be achieved}} by seller education of the service buyer. Buyer education implies both offering services and development of the service buyer's capability to use the service. Service buyer education is facilitated by seller competence on the service offering and the buyer's context. The {{reason for this is that}} the more embedded the service seller is in the buyer's context, the better able are they to educate the service buyer. Antecedent to seller competence, at any given point of time, or level of relationship development, is the service buyer's current understanding of seller resources. The model is tested and confirmed on 255 small firms. The model identifies that education can align the service offering, buyer resources, and seller resources in buyer - seller relationships.

40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, {{differential}} national regulation in conjunction with increasing capital mobility {{has given rise to}} tremendous growth in the Eurocurrency markets. In this paper, we analyze whether the announced plans of the European Commuission to remove barriers to capital flows (in July 1990) and to harmonize other financial regulations (by the end of 1992) will have a major effect on the <b>Euromarkets.</b> The analysis in this paper revolves around the concept of the Net Reguatory Burden (NRB). Three variables will play a crucial role for the developnent of the Euronarkets after 1992. These are (1) reserve requirements on bank deposits, (2) taxation of residents and non-residents on interest income, dividends and capital gains, and (3) disclosure of interest and dividends to tax authorities. Presently there is considerable variation in these factors across Europe. Competitive pressures should lead to a convergence of regulation, but national sovereignty leaves open the possibility for sone divergence of the NRB across European countries, and in comparison with other financial centers such as Switzerland. These differences in NRB will {{play a key role in}} determining the location and size of <b>Euromarkets</b> after 1992. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{empirical}} {{investigation of the}} predictability and comovement of risk premia in the term structure of <b>Euromarket</b> interest rates. We show that variables which {{have been used as}} proxies for risk premia on uncovered foreign asset positions also predict excess returns in <b>Euromarket</b> term structures, while variables which have been used as proxies for risk premia in the term structure also predict excess returns on taking uncovered foreign asset positions. These findings suggest that risk premia move together. We test formally the hypothesis that risk premia on uncovered 3 -month EuroDM and Eurosterling deposits move in proportion to a single latent variable. We are unable to reject this hypothesis. We are also unable to reject the hypothesis that the risk premia on these three strategies and those on rolling over 1 -month Eurosterling (EuroDM) deposit move in proportion to a single latent variable. The single latent variable model can be interpreted atheoretically, as a way of characterizing the extent to which predictable asset returns "move together"; or it can be interpreted as in Hansen and Hodrick (1983) and Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) as a specialization of the ICAPM in which assets have constant betas on a single, unobservable benchmark portfolio. ...|$|E

40|$|Very {{little has}} been written about the cost {{competitiveness}} of the market for Europaper (Euronotes and Eurocommercial paper) despite the extraordinarily rapid growth of this market over the past three years. This paper tries to compare costs to the borrower on 3 -month Europaper with similar costs in the U. S. commercial paper market. On the basis of weekly data in the period June-October, the conclusion is reached that the costs may have been lower in the Europaper market roughly one-third to one-half of the time. Rates paid to investors are, at most times and for most borrowers, lower in the U. S. market than in the <b>Euromarket,</b> but the higher remuneration to dealers in the U. S. market frequently means that all-in costs to the borrower are lower in the <b>Euromarket.</b> Because of the nature and limitations of the data, cost comparisons were limited to estimated rates paid in the two markets only by borrowers whose U. S. commercial paper is rated P- 1 or A- 1. U. S. market borrowing costs were estimated from published composite rates for double-A borrowers, with adjustments where the long-term debt rating of the borrower was not double-A, and from market reports about dealer fees. Europaper borrowing costs had to be inferred from secondary market quotations. Fluctuations in the relative rates suggest the frequent appearance and disappearance of "windows of opportunity" for borrowing in the market with the lower cost at the time.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} some {{questions}} concerning monetary policy in Switzerland. Switzerland {{is an interesting}} case to study because the country is relatively small and correspondingly {{the total amount of}} Swiss franc holdings in the Swiss commercial banking System and in the <b>Euromarkets</b> is small in comparison to the same figures for some other currencies. The Swiss franc, however, appears to be subjected to remarkable changes in its appreciation by foreigners. Periods of strongly rising demand for the Swiss franc were followed by much more constricted views of the international community of wealth holders on the potential to gain from holding Swiss francs. Periods of sharp real appreciations were followed by intervals of time during which the Swiss franc depreciated even in nominal terms. Thus the central bank of Switzerland has to perform a rather difficult task because is faces obstacles which appear magnified when compared to other countries. This study sorts out the goals of Swiss monetary policy, and it also provides some normative Statements which will be put forward hesitatingly, and with due caution because the relevant monetary theory still is in a process of being created. ...|$|R

Internal marketing is gaining significant importance and is increasingly seen as a strategic route for organizations to build and sustain a competitive advantage over rivals. Based on the recognition that companies have two kinds of markets and customers (internal and external) (Piercy, 1995), we expanded previous research to investigate how organizations interact with their environment through their boundary spanning capabilities and activities.

40|$|The main {{theme of}} the {{research}} is to analyse the major reasons behind the international expansion {{of a large number}} of Arab Gulf banks. An attempt is made to examine the role of oil revenues of the 1970 s in the development and international expansion of Arab banks. The study also analyses the role played by the financial markets of the region (i. e. Kuwait and Bahrain) in encouraging the regional and international expansion of Arab banks. Because of the unique features of the Gulf region a historical approach has been adopted to support an understanding of the present bankign practices of the Arab banks. The study follows the development of Arab Gulf banks since their inception in the 1950 s and 1960 s, and includes a survey investigating the expansion of these banks into the major international financial centres of Western Europe, the United States and more recently Tokyo. A comparative analysis to the operational aspects of Arab and other international banks is also provided. The survey was carried out through personal interviews with the senior managements of several Arab banks in London, which allows a comparison to be made between the factors that led to the international expansion of Arab Gulf and western banks. The involvement of Arab banks in the syndicated lending and eurobond markets, is closely examined.

Guidelines to acceptable behaviour {{with regard to}} money and property were offered in the Quran whilst the compilation of further material and its interpretation {{is a process that}} began with the death of the Prophet and continues to the present day. Upon the establishment of the first Islamic bank twenty-five years ago, Islamic finance passed beyond the realm of jurisprudence and has since gained the respect of Western economis 1;s and bankers alike. This period has spawned a considerable volume of theoretical works which detail the wide-ranging benefits particular to an interest-free financial system, and yet, little has been addressed to the experience of Islamic banks themselves. One of the problems for Middle Eastern banking in general is that an Arab marketplace, similar to the US or European example, still does not exist. By examining the performance of Islamic banks in Bahrain, the Arab world's closest equivalent, it is possible to assess the degree of success that a move to Western markets has allowed. The introductory chapter investigates the relationship between Islamic economic theory and practice while chapter two considers Islamic banking theory and comments upon the financing methods available in this sphere. The third chapter looks at the <b>Euromarkets</b> in the context of n 6 a-oriented finance and the opportunities that exist there for Islamic banks.
