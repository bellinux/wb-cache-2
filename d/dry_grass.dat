5|$|Both species {{typically}} {{breed in}} small groups: the Mascarene martin builds a shallow cup nest of twigs and coarse plant material {{with a soft}} inner lining, whereas Brazza's martin makes a small heap of soft material such as feathers or <b>dry</b> <b>grass</b> {{at the end of}} a typically 50-cm (20-in) tunnel in a riverbank. The normal clutch is three eggs for Brazza's martin, two for Mascarene martins on Madagascar and Mauritius, and two or three for those on Réunion. As with other swallows, both martins feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species groups or with other swallows and swifts.|$|E
5|$|The male {{chooses the}} nest site, and uses {{it for his}} {{courtship}} display, spending much time calling nearby. When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, drooping his wings, pushing his chest forward, and lowering his tail. He then bows {{up and down in}} front of the female, who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive. Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of <b>dry</b> <b>grass</b> which fills the nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers for warmth.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift {{is found}} {{in a wide range}} of climatic zones and habitats. It breeds in {{sheltered}} locations such as caves, natural rock crevices or under the roofs of houses. The nest is a half-cup of <b>dry</b> <b>grass</b> and other fine material that is gathered in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a vertical surface. The two or three white eggs are incubated for about seventeen days to hatching. Subsequently, the chicks have a long but variable period in the nest before they are fully fledged. When the parents cannot find sufficient food in bad weather, the young can survive for days without being fed by metabolising body fat.|$|E
50|$|A. versicolor use trails {{to forage}} in groups like most higher attines, but also forage alone {{which is a}} {{characteristic}} of more primitive leafcutter ants. They forage for both green vegetation and <b>dry</b> <b>grasses,</b> but <b>dry</b> <b>grasses</b> make {{up the bulk of}} their forage. A. versicolor will increase the amount of fresh vegetation they collect after significant amounts of rainfall, but will collect <b>dry</b> <b>grasses</b> during <b>drier</b> periods.|$|R

5|$|The males sing {{throughout}} much of the construction and even more so when a female approaches his nest. Following copulation, the male and female continue to build the nest. Nests may be in any type of hole, common locations include inside hollowed trees, buildings, tree stumps and man-made nest-boxes. S. v. zetlandicus typically breeds in crevices and holes in cliffs, a habitat only rarely used by the nominate form. Nests are typically made out of straw, <b>dry</b> <b>grass</b> and twigs with an inner lining made up of feathers, wool and soft leaves. Construction usually takes four or five days and may continue through incubation.|$|E
5|$|Martin pairs often nest alone, {{although}} where suitable {{sites are}} available small loose colonies may form. These {{are more common}} south of the Sahara, where up to 40 rock martin pairs together have been recorded. Crag martins aggressively defend their nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. The nest, built by both adults over several weeks, is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft <b>dry</b> <b>grass</b> or sometimes feathers. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Usually two broods are raised, and the rock martin may nest for a third time in a season.|$|E
5|$|Most Apus swift species nest {{in rocky}} areas, and the {{majority}} will accept human habitations {{as a substitute for}} natural sites. The Pacific swift is a colonial species which nests in sheltered locations such as caves, crevices in vertical rock faces (including sea-cliffs), or under the eaves of houses. The nest is a half-cup of feathers, <b>dry</b> <b>grass</b> and other light vegetation collected in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a ledge or vertical surface with the same substance. Two or three eggs is the normal clutch, the number varying with geographical location. In areas where three eggs are usual, a fourth may occasionally be laid; no larger clutches are known. The eggs are white, as with all swifts, and 24–27.5x16–17mm (0.95–1.08x0.63–0.67in) in size. They are incubated by both parents for about 17 days prior to hatching as unfeathered and blind altricial chicks. Both adults brood and feed the chicks, which fledge in an average 40.5days.|$|E

5|$|Nests {{built in}} the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of <b>dry</b> <b>grass,</b> twigs, and other plant {{material}}s. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into the nest. In cavity nests, the hole is filled with a shapeless mass of grass {{with a cup of}} soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, they are simply given a soft lining. The nest entrance is on the side, and is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie (Helichrysum pumilio), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and camphor (Cinnamomum). This consistent use of aromatics suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is from August to January, though dependent on local conditions. The nest site is {{usually in the}} drooping foliage of a tall shrub or low tree, such as Casuarina, Melaleuca, Acacia, and mallee eucalypts. The site is sometimes near to or overhanging water, and the nest is usually constructed {{at the end of}} a drooping branch, suspended from twigs or foliage. The striped honeyeater often nests in the vicinity of a nesting butcherbird. It builds a deep cup-shaped or bag-shaped nest, with thick walls and the lip of the opening turned slightly inwards. The nest is made from thin <b>dry</b> <b>grass</b> and coated with plant down, feathers or wool, the coating often completely obscuring the grass framework. It is lined with spider webs, hair, wool or rootlets, and on occasion flowers and tissue paper. The striped honeyeater will commonly re-use material from previous nests.|$|E
5|$|The female {{song thrush}} builds a neat {{cup-shaped}} nest lined with mud and <b>dry</b> <b>grass</b> in a bush, tree or creeper, or, {{in the case}} of the Hebridean subspecies, on the ground. She lays four or five bright glossy blue eggs which are lightly spotted with black or purple; they are typically 2.7x2.0 centimetres (0.79x1.06in) in size and weigh 6.0grammes (0.21oz), of which 6% is shell. The female incubates the eggs alone for 10–17days, and after hatching a similar time elapses until the young fledge. Two or three broods in a year is normal, although only one may be raised in the north of the range. On average, 54.6% of British juveniles survive the first year of life, and the adult annual survival rate is 62.2%. The typical lifespan is three years, but the maximum recorded age is 10years 8months.|$|E

The whole was thatched with <b>dried</b> <b>grass</b> and bound down with ropes made of the same material. It was further secured against the possible influence of high winds, by heavy branches being laid across it and weighted with stones. <b>Dried</b> <b>grass</b> also formed the carpeting on the floor.|$|R

5|$|The female may {{be offered}} food by the male during {{courtship}}. He has a brief courtship display {{in which the}} neck is extended and the head held down, the tail is fanned, and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground. He will then attempt to approach the female from behind, and then leap on her back to copulate. The nest is typically in grassland, sometimes in safer sites along a hedge, or near an isolated tree or bush, or in overgrown vegetation. Where grass is not tall enough {{at the start of}} the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill. The nest, well hidden in the grass, is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground. It is made of woven coarse <b>dry</b> <b>grass</b> and other plants, and lined with finer grasses. Although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female, a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest.|$|E
5|$|The nest, {{built by}} both adults over several weeks, {{is made from}} several hundred mud pellets and lined with {{feathers}} and soft, <b>dry</b> <b>grass,</b> hair, sheep’s wool or plant down. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Caves are found in limestone formations and in the lava flows which cover much of western Saudi Arabia, and their ceilings are a favoured location for nesting pale crag martins, red-rumped swallows, and the little swifts which may appropriate the hirundines' nests. In buildings, nests are usually constructed against concrete, which provides adhesion similar to that of rock, but metal walls are sometimes used, and nests may be supported on beams or other horizontal supports. Birds sometimes breed in occupied buildings, and there is a record of a pair nesting in a busy restaurant kitchen. Artificial nests are readily used, and halved coconut shells have been successfully occupied in Abu Dhabi.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season takes place over five months from August to January {{with up to}} three broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by rubbing his body over a suitable tree fork, all the while trilling continuously. He may indicate several sites before the female ultimately makes the decision where to build, at which point she constructs the nest alone. The nest is a neat, deep cup made of soft <b>dry</b> <b>grass</b> and bark. Spider webs, feathers and fur are used for binding or filling, and the nest is generally placed in a tree fork or even a mistletoe bush. It may be decorated with lichen and camouflaged {{to blend in with}} its surroundings. Two to three dull white eggs tinted bluish, greyish or brownish and splotched with dark grey-brown are laid on consecutive days, measuring 16mm × 13mm (0.6 × 0.5in). Females alone develop brood patches and incubate, although both sexes feed the young. The male will keep lookout either on the nest or perched on a nearby branch, rather than brood while the female is foraging, and parents will feed young and dart off quickly if there are predators in the vicinity. Extra-pair mating and fertilisation is fairly common, with 23% of nestlings and 37% of broods having a different father to the one rearing them, and {{there is some evidence that}} extra-pair couplings are more likely to produce male birds.|$|E

25|$|Cin'aq (Yukon, Hooper Bay and Chevak, Lake Iliamna, and Nunivak) is cheese-like fish aged in a pit. This fish {{is usually}} dog (chum) or king (chinook) salmon. The salmon whole (except the guts) aged {{through the process}} of burying them into the marshy, muddy lowland (maraq). The hole is dug until the {{permafrost}} is exposed. The bottom of the hole is then covered with <b>dry</b> <b>grass,</b> moss, and cardboard. Then several salmon are placed in. The top of the salmon is again covered with grass, moss and or cardboard, then the remaining dug up groung is placed back into the hole, tightly covering the contents. The aged salmon fish are usually dug out during the early winter, and eaten as a delicacy.|$|E
25|$|Topi live {{primarily}} in grassland habitats ranging from treeless plains to savannas. In ecotone habitats between woodlands and open grasslands, they stay {{along the edge}} using the shade in hot weather. They prefer pastures with green grass that is medium in height with leaf-like swards. Topis are more densely populated in areas where green plants last into the dry season, particularly near water. The topi is a selective feeder and uses its elongated muzzle and flexible lips to forage for the freshest plants. When foraging for food, topi tend to take small bites at a fast rate. Topi generally frequent flat lowlands and at elevations below 1500 m. When {{they have access to}} enough green vegetation, topi usually do not have to drink. They drink more when relying on <b>dry</b> <b>grass.</b> Topi use , such as termite mounds, to {{get a good look at}} their surroundings.|$|E

Traditionally, skins of birds, fish, and marine mammals such as seal and walrus, and land mammals were used to make clothing. Hunting clothes were designed to be insulated and waterproof. Fish skin and marine mammal intestines (guts) were used for waterproof shells (as gut parka) and boots. <b>Dried</b> <b>grass</b> was used to make insulating socks, and as a waterproof thread.|$|R

25|$|The male will {{courtship}} {{feed the}} female to reinforce their pair-bond or {{to secure a}} mating opportunity. The nest is a well concealed cup of <b>dry</b> <b>grass</b> that is positioned in a deep scrape {{at the base of}} a grass tuft or against a shrub. A flimsy or substantial grass dome (typical of Mirafra and related genera) covers the nest while leaving a front entrance. The cup is lined with finer plant material, and 2 to 3 (rarely 4) eggs are laid. The eggs are white, cream or pink in colour, and speckled brown and grey, especially near the blunter end. The chicks have bright yellow gapes, three black tongue spots, and a spot near the tip of the lower mandible. They are covered in pale grey to buff down, and are brooded by the female only. The incubation period is about 14 to 15 days, and singing by the male decreases as incubation commences. The young are fed by both parents, though mainly by the female. Surviving chicks leave the nest after about 12 days, before they are able to fly. Post-breeding moult has been recorded in mid December in Botswana and from July to August in Kenya.|$|E
25|$|A box cooker has a {{transparent}} glass or plastic top, {{and it may}} have additional reflectors to concentrate sunlight into the box. The top can usually be removed to allow dark pots containing food to be placed inside. One or more reflectors of shiny metal or foil-lined material may be positioned to bounce extra light into the interior of the oven chamber. Cooking containers and the inside bottom of the cooker should be dark-colored or black. Inside walls should be reflective to reduce radiative heat loss and bounce the light towards the pots and the dark bottom, which is in contact with the pots. The box should have insulated sides. Thermal insulation for the solar box cooker must be able to withstand temperatures up to 150°C (300°F) without melting or out-gassing. Crumpled newspaper, wool, rags, <b>dry</b> <b>grass,</b> sheets of cardboard, etc. can be used to insulate the walls of the cooker. Metal pots and/or bottom trays can be darkened either with flat-black spray paint (one that is non-toxic when warmed), black tempera paint, or soot from a fire. The solar box cooker typically reaches a temperature of 150°C (300°F). This is not as hot as a standard oven, but still hot enough to cook food over a somewhat longer period of time.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{task of the}} landscape maintenance is the conservation of the dry and non-forested neglected meadows and dry meadowy slopes. Botanists have named this type of vegetation Magerrasen (neglected grassland). The ground there is covered with thin <b>dry</b> <b>grass</b> and a typical feature are the irregularly spaced juniper bushes. Well over 40 different species of flowering plants grow on this nutrient-poor, non-fertilised soil. Often different small species of gentian can be found. In late summer pasqueflower and Carline thistle bloom. From April until June orange tips fly over the sunny slopes. One of the most {{important task}}s for conservation of the neglected grassland is traditional herding. Grazing with sheep is a prerequisite for the long-lasting conservation of this grassland. If the amount of herding was reduced, initially more thorny and needle-bearing shrubs would grow because these are eschewed by sheep - the large number of juniper bushes thrive for the same reason. Under cover of these thornbushes and hedges other groves and the first trees would develop. In the final stage the mountain would become mostly overgrown with forest. The herbs and grasses of the neglected grassland have a positive influence {{on the quality of the}} sheep's meat. Due to this fact the restaurants of the Hesselberg region increasingly offer dishes of Hesselberg lamb.|$|E
