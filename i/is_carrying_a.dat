Monk recognizes the rock, though he does not know where he saw it.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the female}} <b>is</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an egg {{deposition}} site. The choice {{of such a}} site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued {{by one or more}} males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to fertilise the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours.|$|E
25|$|One morning, Harold finds Elsie {{sitting on}} a log in the woods, crying {{about the state of}} her life.

Her husband has arrived at the hotel {{unexpectedly}} and is in a terrible rage. At that moment, Philip Clayton runs in. He <b>is</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> spanner and screams at Elsie, accusing her of having an affair just as one of the Polish women had told him. He chases Elsie out of Harold's room and back to her own. Harold runs after him and is in time to see Elsie throw a paperweight at her husband in self-defence. He falls to the ground and Elsie begs Harold to leave them before he gets himself into trouble. Half an hour later, Mrs Rice joins Harold and tells him that Philip is dead, killed by the blow.|$|E
500|$|Kaali is {{depicted}} in the Mahakaali form as having ten heads, ten arms, and ten legs. Each of her ten hands <b>is</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> various implement which vary in different accounts, but each of these represent the power {{of one of the}} Devas or Hindu Gods and are often the identifying weapon or ritual item of a given Deva. The implication is that Mahakaali subsumes and is responsible for the powers that these deities possess and this is in line with the interpretation that Mahakaali is identical with Brahman. While not displaying ten heads, an [...] "ekamukhi" [...] or one headed image may be displayed with ten arms, signifying the same concept: the powers of the various Gods come only through Her grace.|$|E

[...] He spots the popular Liz Taylbone, {{with whom he had}} been smitten since high school, but he is too passive and timid to draw her attention. [...] After watching a Marlon Brando movie on TV in the lounge he is infused with courage and returns to the party imitating Brando's attitude and mannerisms. [...] He draws the attention of Liz Taylbone and the crowd, but not for his Brando impression as he thinks—rather, they are impressed to learn that, as an off-duty police officer, Goodman <b>is</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> pistol. [...] The group coaxes him into going with them to a night club known for its rough clientele. [...] When the rough crowd arrives, Goodman's group expects the gun to serve as their protection—until Goodman lets them know his newfound self-confidence drove him to quit the police force two hours earlier. [...] The group abandons Goodman to a thrashing by the thugs.|$|E

Dr. Schultz insists on honorably paying Dicky a fair price for Django before leaving him {{at the mercy of the}} newly-freed slaves, who kill him and follow the North Star to freedom. As Django can identify the Brittle brothers, Dr. Schultz offers him his freedom in exchange for help tracking them down.|$|E

500|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld is {{a single}} player, action-adventure video game. The game is {{presented}} in third person perspective, where the player takes control of Lara Croft. Lara's environment reproduces a more [...] "interactive world that reacts and remembers", such that footprints left in the mud or mud transferred to Lara's knee from kneeling {{on the ground is}} washed away by rain, the bodies of the foes she encounters remain where she killed them, and any destruction to the environment she causes is permanent. According to creative director Eric Lindstrom, this is [...] "to not only reward the player for the effect they're having on the world, but to give them navigational aids." [...] The game uses an animation blending system that allows Lara to interact dynamically with her environment, such as pushing foliage aside with one or two hands, depending on if she <b>is</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> weapon. It also features a [...] "hybrid lighting model that combines dynamic lights with carefully created light maps" [...] and a weather system that changes the environment, for example, [...] "If Lara’s negotiating a wet ledge she’s more apt to slip or lose grip," [...] which makes [...] "the environment [...] her adversary" [...] for {{a large part of the}} game.|$|E
500|$|In certain situations, law {{enforcement}} may {{perform a search}} {{when they have a}} reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, even if it falls short of probable cause necessary for an arrest. Under Terry v. Ohio (1968), {{law enforcement}} officers are permitted to conduct a limited warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause under certain circumstances. In Terry, the Supreme Court ruled that when a police officer witnesses [...] "unusual conduct" [...] that leads that officer to reasonably believe [...] "that criminal activity may be afoot", that the suspicious person has a weapon and that the person is presently dangerous to the officer or others, the officer may conduct a [...] "pat-down search" [...] (or [...] "frisk") to determine whether the person <b>is</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> weapon. This detention and search is known as a Terry stop. To conduct a frisk, officers must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant their actions. As established in Florida v. Royer (1983), such a search must be temporary, and questioning must be limited to the purpose of the stop (e.g., officers who stop a person because they have reasonable suspicion to believe that the person was driving a stolen car, cannot, after confirming that it is not stolen, compel the person to answer questions about anything else, such as the possession of contraband).|$|E
