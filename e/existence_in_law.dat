This research use juridical normative method. The research finds that some of the concept is in contradiction with the 1945 constitution and another Law which is related to the protection of labor, and even with the other articles that exists in the Labor Law itself so thats the norm contains contradictio adconceptio. Therefore, the system of outsourcing that will be regulated should consider the principles of goof outsourcing governance. They are: legal protection, non-discrimination, worker as the subject not as an object, benefit and welfare, sustainable working relation, and the shifting of protection to the labor...|$|E

Finally, the development of sound conditional release programs for criminal defendants found not guilty by reason of insanity is proposed as a reform option which could serve the objectives of enhancing public safety and access to appropriate treatment while continuing to meet the objectives of the insanity defense within criminal jurisprudence.

During {{the time of}} their <b>existence</b> <b>in</b> the <b>law,</b> they however passed through numerous changes, which resulted in a non-uniform exercise of the rules and caused legislative chaos. Due to these reasons, lawmakers subjected them to an essential transformation in 2009 in effort to adjust a stricter regime for the application of thin capitalization rules and to enact their uniform assertion in all credit and loan contracts including annexes regardless of closing date from the beginning of taxing period 2010. In this connexion, a uniform definition was stipulated of joint persons concerned by the rules, which may in some cases adversely affect the assessment base of the taxpayer. The paper investigates the effect of a uniform application of thin capitalization rules including the definition of joint persons in the corporate assessment base in the tax period of 2010 and compares on the basis of comparative analysis whether the original application of rules prior to the tax period of 2010 was more favourable for taxpayers from the taxation point of view or not. The comparison is carried out on model examples on which we veri­fied which procedure is optimal for taxpayers from the taxation point of view. With respect to our findings, the paper also contains a proposal for amendment in the income tax law so that the appli­cation of thin capitalization rules in force since the tax period of 2010 does not impose excessive tax burden on taxpayers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} a result of a {{critical}} consideration of the crime of robbery as defined <b>in</b> South African <b>law.</b> The historical origin and development of the crime was investigated. The development of the crime of robbery <b>in</b> South African <b>law</b> and the current law relating to robbery were researched. Sentencing for the crime of robbery <b>in</b> South African <b>law</b> is discussed and relevant aspects relating to criminal procedure were identified. The constitutionality of the crime was also analysed. The crime of robbery as defined in the jurisdictions of England, Canada and Germany were subsequently considered on a legal-comparative basis. The study demonstrates that the crime of robbery still warrants a separate <b>existence</b> <b>in</b> South African <b>law.</b> However, certain problem areas relating to the ambit of the crime are identified. One of these problem areas is so-called “bag-snatching ” where South African courts have applied the elements of the crime arbitrarily, resulting in legal uncertainty. The conclusion reached is that the law relating to robbery is in need of reform. The crime situation in South Africa today, and the increase in violent crime, including robbery, make the broadening of the ambit of the common-law crime advisable. Various such proposals are made including the introduction of legislation which broadens the ambit of the common-law crime. A scale on which the various manifestations of the offence are rated according to their severity, is suggested to provide guidance to courts when sentencing those found guilty of robbery. In conclusion, draft legislation which delineates the offence in its various manifestations is proposed...|$|R

The 1 st chapter deals with different notions of the uniqueness and existence and the relations between them. We present an alternative construction of an stochastic integral in BS and we prove Burkholder inequality, Fubini theorem, the Chojnowska-Michalik theorem and Girsanov theorem. We prove distribution preserving theorems for Bochner integrals, stochastic integrals and measurable selectors as well. The 2 nd chapter regards the Brownian representations of local cylindrical martingales in BS and the martingale problem in infinite dimensions. We used these results for illustrating {{the role of the}} notion well-posedness and for showing that weak <b>existence</b> and uniqueness <b>in</b> <b>law</b> for the equation imply the strong Markov property of the solutions.

40|$|Two {{frameworks}} {{that have}} been used to characterize reflected diffusions include stochastic differential equations with reflection and the so-called submartingale problem. We introduce a general formulation of the submartingale problem for (obliquely) reflected diffusions in domains with piecewise C^ 2 boundaries and piecewise continuous reflection vector fields. Under suitable assumptions, we show that well-posedness of the submartingale problem is equivalent to <b>existence</b> and uniqueness <b>in</b> <b>law</b> of weak solutions to the corresponding stochastic differential equation with reflection. Our result generalizes to the case of reflecting diffusions a classical result due to Stroock and Varadhan on the equivalence of well-posedness of martingale problems and well-posedness of weak solutions of stochastic differential equations in d-dimensional Euclidean space. The analysis in the case of reflected diffusions in domains with non-smooth boundaries is considerably more subtle and requires a careful analysis of the behavior of the reflected diffusion on the boundary of the domain. In particular, the equivalence can fail to hold when our assumptions are not satisfied. The equivalence we establish allows one to transfer results on reflected diffusions characterized by one approach to reflected diffusions analyzed by the other approach. As an application, we provide a characterization of stationary distributions of a large class of reflected diffusions in convex polyhedral domains. Comment: 49 page...|$|R
