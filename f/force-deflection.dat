Experiments were carried out to measure the <b>force-deflection</b> behaviour of a cricket ball during a normal impact in two orientations (impacting on the seam and perpendicular to the seam). For the two orientations of impact, a disparity was found {{in terms of the}} <b>force-deflection</b> behaviour. Greater deformation was found for impacts landing on the seam, compared to those landing perpendicular to the seam. Comparisons with quasi-static test data suggested that only the bottom third of the ball may have been compressed during impact. The dynamic <b>force-deflection</b> behaviour was modelled using a mass attached to a Hertzian spring in parallel with a damper whose damping coefficient varied with the contact area. The coefficients in the model could be described using the velocity before impact alone. The model was found to be in good agreement with the experimental data.

AbstractâFinite element (FE) models of rat skull bone samples were {{developed}} by reconstructing the three-dimensional geom-etry of microCT images and voxel-based hexahedral meshes. An optimization-based material identification method was developed to obtain the most favorable material property parameters by minimizing differences in three-point bending test responses between experimental and simulation results. An anisotropic Kriging model and sequential quadratic program-ming, in conjunction with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), are utilized to minimize the disparity between the experimental and FE model predicted <b>forceâdeflection</b> curves. A selected number of material parameters, namely Youngâs modulus, yield stress, tangent modulus, and failure strain, are varied iteratively using the proposed optimization scheme until the assessment index âFâ, the objective function comparing simu-lation and experimental <b>forceâdeflection</b> curves through least squares, is minimized. Results show that through the applica-tion of this method, the optimized models â <b>forceâdeflection</b> curves are closely {{in accordance with the}} measured data.

The goals were to resolve discrepancies and fill in some of the gaps with regard to the biomechanical response of the human abdomen to dynamic loading in the automotive environment. Three types of impact tests were conducted. Following a review and reanalysis of the data in the literature on abdominal impact response, rigid-bar tests were performed into the mid and upper abdomen of unembalmed instrumented human cadavers using different impactor speeds. Most tests were conducted using a free-back condition, but several tests were conducted using a fixedback condition {{to examine the effects of}} body mass and spinal flexion on the response. <b>Force-deflection</b> corridors were developed and compared to those previously established by other researchers. The second type of test involved dynamic belt loading of the unembalmed cadaver abdomen at the lower and midabdomen regions.

The third type of test conducted involved static deployment of passenger frontal-impact airbags into the closely positioned abdomen. Three airbag tests were conducted using three unembalmed cadavers.

This project {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a test apparatus that will both accurately simulate a projectile impact event and provide an accurate means of analysing a material response to projectile impact events. A low velocity apparatus, based on the conventional instrumented drop tower apparatus, was designed and constructed. The apparatus is instrumented in order that the penetration resistance force history and impact velocity can be measured by a data acquisition system for further analysis. A software package, developed specifically for the apparatus, manipulates the acquired load-time trace and generates the necessary force and energy-deflection curves. A series of tests were performed to verify the validity and reproducibility of the results. The plastic deformation that occurs during a rebound impact event is compared to the plastic deformation as measured by the impact testing apparatus. These tests show that the apparatus can accurately measure the plastic deformation that occurs during a rebound impact event. A series of reproducibility tests proved that the apparatus is capable of generating almost identical <b>force-deflection</b> curves for tests conducted with given impact parameters. A series of tests were performed to analyse the impact response of the ductile material, aluminium alloy grade 1200.

40|$|Abstract â During needle-based procedures, {{transitions}} be-tween tissue layers often involve puncture {{events that}} produce substantial deformation {{and tend to}} drive the needle off course. In this paper, we analyze the mechanics of these rupture events corresponding to unstable crack propagation during the insertion of a sharp needle in an inhomogeneous tissue. The <b>force-deflection</b> curve of the needle prior to a rupture event is modeled by a nonlinear viscoelastic Kelvin model and a stress analysis is used to predict the relationship between rupture force and needle velocity. The model predicts that the <b>force-deflection</b> response of the needle is steeper and the tissue absorbs less energy when the needle moves faster. The force of rupture also decreases for faster insertion under certain conditions. The observed properties are sufficient to show that maximizing needle velocity minimizes tissue deformation and damage, and consequently, results in less needle insertion position error. The model predicts that tissue deformation and absorbed energy asymptotically approach lower bounds as velocity increases. Experiments with porcine cardiac tissue confirm the analytical predictions.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} rigid body motions of skew bridges, {{concentrating on the}} {{in-plane}} translational and rotational displacements of the bridge deck induced by impact between the deck and the abutments. Experience in the San Fernando Earthquake of February 9, 1971 demonstrates that this feature is particularly important for skew bridges. A simple model, in which the bridge deck is represented by a rigid rod restricted by column and abutment springs is examined first. This model illustrates the mechanism by which in-plane rotational vibrations is triggered after {{the closure of the}} gap between the bridge deck and the abutment. It also shows that the <b>force-deflection</b> relations of the columns and the abutments are particularly important features for the response of the bridge. methods for the exact and approximate estimation of the elastic stiffness of elastically founded, tapered bridge columns with octagonal cross section are presented next. The methods are applied to a bridge used later as an example. In addition, the yielding of the columns is examined and the <b>force-deflection</b> relations for bending about two orthogonal axes are estimated. The abutments are treated as rigid bodies and the soil embankments as Winkler Foundations with elastic spring constants increasing with depth. For the examination of the yielding of soil the Rankine theory is used. Based on these assumptions an approximate <b>force-deflection</b> relation for the abutments is constructed.

All tests were performed using a dual-sled, side-impact test facility. A multi-segmented impactor was mounted on a sled that was pneumatically accelerated into a second, initially stationary sled on which a cadaver subject was seated facing perpendicular to the direction of impact. Sizes and heights of impactor segments were adjusted for each subject so that forces applied to different anatomic regions including thorax, abdomen, greater trochanter, iliac wing, and thigh could be independently measured on each cadaver. For all tests, the impactor contact surfaces were located in the same vertical plane except that the abdomen plate was offset 5. 1 cm toward the subject. Each subject was first impacted {{on one side of the}} body using an initial impactor speed of 3 m/s. Following the five of these tests that did not result in injury, the contralateral side of the body was impacted at a speed of either 8 m/s or 10 m/s. The masses of the sleds and the <b>force-deflection</b> characteristics of the energy-absorbing material that acted as the interface between the sleds were set so that the velocity history of the impactor sled matched the average driver door velocity history produced in a series of side NCAP tests. Impactor padding was also selected so that average ATD pelvis and thorax responses from the same series of side NCAP tests were reproduced when the ATD used in these tests was impacted using the average door-velocity history. Results of these tests were used to develop <b>force-deflection</b> response targets for the abdomen, force history response targets for the pelvis (iliac wing and greater trochanter), the midthigh, and the thorax at each of the three impact velocities.

40|$|Whereas {{most studies}} of tail-suspension induced {{osteopenia}} have utilized rat femora, {{the present study}} investigated the effects of a 14 day tail-suspension on the mechanical behaviour of mice femora, tibiae and humeri. <b>Force-deflection</b> properties were obtained via three-point bending for long bones from suspended and control mice. Whole bone behaviour was characterized by converting the <b>force-deflection</b> values to stiffness, strength, ductility and energy parameters which were not normalized for specimen geometry. The effects of a systematic variation in the deflection rate over the range 0. 1 - 10 mm min- 1 were also evaluated. Statistical analysis indicated that the primary effect of the tail-suspension period was lowered bone mass which was manifested mechanically through lower values of the bone strength parameters. These effects were similar in the bones of both the fore and hind limbs. The results also demonstrated that the stiffness, ductility and energy characteristics were much less influenced by the tail-suspension. Whereas a significant dependence of the bone strength values upon deflection rate was observed for the femora and humeri, the other mechanical parameters were less sensitive.

In {{the present}} paper the authors refer about a series of {{experimental}} tests, where an aluminium alloy square tube, filled with an aluminium foam, was crushed by a longitudinal load at a speed of 10 m/s. The test apparatus consisted of a sled installed on a very stiff frame moving on appropriate guides, as the specimen was set on a home-made fixture. Two arrangements of square tubes were considered as specimens: a âstandard â one and an âoptimized â one. Both crushing behaviours and energy absorption capabilities were analyzed experimentally and numerically simulated {{by means of the}} explicit FE code LS-DYNA; the complete numerical model consisted of the striker, the assemblage of square tubes and the base.

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{mechanical}} {{properties of materials}} used in the manufacturing of micro/nano devices, the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are very important. These parameters determine the static and dynamic characteristics of micro/nano devices such as the <b>force-deflection</b> relationship and resonant frequencies. In the past, the Young's modulus of materials has been measured by the <b>force-deflection</b> method [1 - 4]. The Poisson's ratio was separately determined using the deflection method [5], nano-indentation method [6] or by using atomic force microscopy [7]. The resonant method permits the simultaneous extraction of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio [8, 9]; however, this method requires prior knowledge of {{the density of the}} material to determine the equivalent mass of the test structure, and this value may vary greatly if different processes are used for forming the material. A method that integrates atomic force microscopy (AFM) with digital image correlation (DIC) has also been reported to simultaneously extract the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio [10], and more thorough and expanded work related to [10] was reported in [11 - 14]. The Young's modulus of thin film materials has been measured using the <b>force-deflection</b> method where the deflection was measured using an optical interferometer [15]. Determination of material properties of microcantilevers has also been reported by integrating interferometrically measured deflection data from electrostatically actuated microcantilevers with a numerical finite difference model [16]. The Young's modulus of silicon material has also been extracted using a purely optical method [17, 18]. Sharpe [19] summarized some of the progress in the area of experimental determination of mechanical properties of micrometer size sensors and actuators over the past 15 years. In this paper, a new cross-shaped structure is designed for extracting both the Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus simultaneously, based on the <b>force-deflection</b> approach, without the need for a priori density information of the test material. A KLA-Tencor Alpha-Step IQ Surface Profiler is used both for exerting forces on the test structure and measuring the resultant deflections. A series of analytical equations are derived for extracting the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio based on beam mechanics. There are two main steps in the analysis. First, the Young's modulus is extracted from a clamped-clamped beam with a vertical load in the centre. In the second step, the Poisson's ratio is measured by exerting a vertical force on the tip of the 'cross' beam. The second step uses the value of the Young's modulus extracted from the first step. Accordingly this paper is organized as follows: the design of the cross-shaped structure and derivation of the analytical formulae for extracting the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are described in section 2. Fabrication and experimental results are presented in section 3. An established method for measuring the Young's modulus to validate the new approach is described in section 4.
