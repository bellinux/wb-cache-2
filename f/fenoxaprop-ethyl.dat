40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi {{investigar}} o grau de tolerância de cultivares de trigo e aveia aos herbicidas diclofop-methyl, <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> e haloxyfop-methyl, visando a utilização seletiva desses produtos para controlar espécies gramíneas infestantes dessas culturas. Foi instalado um experimento de campo e outro de casa-de-vegetação. Os tratamentos testados no experimento de campo foram diclofop-methyl (540 g/ha), <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> (180 g/ha), haloxyfop-methyl (120 g/ha) e uma testemunha sem tratamento herbicida, aplicados sobre as cultivares 'CTC- 1 ', 'UFRGS- 7 ' e 'UPF- 16 ' de aveia branca, e em aveia-preta. No experimento de casa-de-vegetação testaram-se três doses de <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> (0, 90 e 120 g/ha), aplicadas sobre sete cultivares de trigo ('BR- 23 ', 'BR- 35 ', 'BR- 38 ', 'E- 16 ', 'E- 40 ', 'E- 49 ' e 'E- 52 '), aveia-branca, aveia-preta e azevém. Como resultados do ensaio de campo, constatou-se que todos os herbicidas testados controlaram com eficiência (acima de 90 %) as cultivares de aveia-branca. A aveia-preta mostrou alta sensibilidade ao <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> e ao haloxyfop-methyl e alguma tolerância ao diclofop-methyl; já o trigo mostrou-se tolerante ao diclofop-methyl e ao <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl.</b> Em casa-de-vegetação, as cultivares de trigo 'BR- 38 ', 'E- 16 ', 'E- 49 ' e 'E- 52 ' apresentaram níveis aceitáveis de fitotoxicidade para <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> a 90 g/ha, enquanto as demais cultivares ('BR- 23 ', 'BR- 35 ' e 'E- 40 ') apresentaram danos moderados ao herbicida. Já <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> a 120 g/ha causou aumento no nível de fitotoxicidade para as cultivares de trigo, exceto para 'E- 16 ' e 'E- 52 '. O azevém mostrou-se tolerante ao herbicida <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl.</b> Conclui-se que existe potencial de uso do herbicida <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> em lavouras de trigo para controlar seletivamente aveia-branca e aveia-preta. O herbicida diclofop-methyl apresenta controle elevado de aveia-branca e reduzido de aveia-preta. Haloxyfop-methyl não evidenciou seletividade ao trigo, controlando com eficiência as gramíneas testadas. The {{objective of}} this study was to investigate the tolerance levels of wheat and oat cultivars to the herbicide diclofop-methyl, <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> and haloxyfop-methyl, aiming the selective use of these chemicals to control grass species that may infest these crops. Two experiments have been performed, one at field condition and another in the greenhouse. Treatments tested in the field were diclofop-methyl at 540 g/ha, <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> at 180 g/ha, haloxyfop-methyl at 120 g/ha, plus a check without herbicide treatment, applied on Avena sativa cultivars 'CTC- 1 ', 'UFRGS- 7 ' and 'UPF- 16 ', and on Avena strigosa. In the greenhouse experiment, three rates of <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> (0, 90 and 120 g/ha) have been tested, applied on seven wheat cultivars ('BR- 23 ', 'BR- 35 ', 'BR- 38 ', 'E- 16 ', 'E- 40 ', 'E- 49 ' and 'E- 52 '), on aots, Avena strigosa and ryegrass. As results of field trial, it was detected that all herbicides tested controlled efficiently (over 90 %) oat cultivars. Avena strigosa showed high sensitivity to <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> and haloxyfop-methyl, and some tolerance to diclofop-methyl, whereas wheat showed tolerance to diclofop-methyl and <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl.</b> In the greenhouse, wheat cultivars 'BR- 38 ', 'E- 16 ', 'E- 49 ' and 'E- 52 ' presented cceptable levels of injury to <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> at 90 g/ha, while the other cultivars ('BR- 23 ', 'BR- 35 ' and 'E- 52 ') presented moderate injury to the herbicide. On the other hand, fenoxaprop-methyl at 120 g/ha caused increased injury levels to all wheat cultivars, except 'E- 16 ' and 'E- 52 '. Ryegrass showed tolerance to <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl.</b> It was concluded that it is possible to use <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> herbicide in wheat fields for selective controle of oats and A. strigosa. Diclofop-methyl presents high levels of oats control, but reduced control of A. strigosa. Haloxyfop-methyl did not prove selective for wheat, controlling with efficiency the grasses tested...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> is {{currently}} registered {{for use in}} California as a selective post emergent rice herbicide. Anomalies in fetal rats and liver toxicity in adult laboratory animals dosed with this chemical prompted the risk assessment for <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl.</b> The Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company has submitted an application to register <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> for use on turfgrass, ornamentals and rights-of-way. The Acclaim Ò 1 EC Herbicide label permits applications to be made with a ground boom tractor, low or high volume spraygun or hand-held sprayer. Estimates of the occupational exposure to <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> from applying Acclaim Ò 1 EC Herbicide range from 0. 20 - 5. 85 mg per workday. Although human dermal absorption data are not available, results from a rat study indicate that 73 % of a 2. 3 ug/cm 2 dose was considered absorbed after a 10 -hour exposure period. The estimated mean absorbed daily dosage for applications made at the maximum label rate were 5. 72 ug/kg/day for a golf course maintenance applicator and 56. 4 ug/kg/day for a residential pest control operator making applications with a hand-held spray gun.

40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted during rabi season of 2011 - 12 at Junagadh {{to find out}} most suitable and economically viable method of weed control in rabi fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.). The dominant weed species observed were Cyperus rotundus L., Chenopodium album L., Digera arvensis Forsk and Asphodelus tenuifolius L. Cav. Results revealed that besides weed free treatment, significantly higher plant height, number of branches/plant, number of umbels/plant, number of seeds/umbellate, test weight, seed weight per plant, and seed and stover yields of fennel were recorded with pre-emergence (PRE) application of pendimethalin at 0. 90 kg/ha + post-emergence (POE) application of <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> at 75 g/ha at 45 DAS which was at par with PRE application of pendimethalin at 0. 90 kg/ha + hand weeding (HW) at 45 DAS and HW twice at 15 and 45 DAS. These treatments also recorded lower weed density and dry weight of weeds along with highest net returns (81993 & 81442 `/ha) and B:C ratio owing to lower weed index and higher weed control efficiency. However, the highest depletion of weed seedbank was observed with PRE application of pendimethalin at 0. 90 kg/ha + HW at 45 DAS...|$|E
40|$|The {{stereoselective}} metabolism of the enantiomers of <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> (FE) and {{its primary}} chiral metabolite fenoxaprop (FA) in rabbits in vivo and in vitro was studied {{based on a}} validated chiral high-performance liquid chromatography method. The information of in vivo metabolism was obtained by intravenous administration of racemic FE, racemic FA, and optically pure (-) -(S) -FE and (+) -(R) -FE separately. The results showed that FE degraded very fast to the metabolite FA, which was then metabolized in a stereoselective way in vivo: (-) -(S) -FA degraded faster in plasma, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and bile than its antipode. Moreover, a conversion of (-) -(S) -FA to (+) -(R) -FA in plasma was found after injection of optically pure (-) -(S) - and (+) -(R) -FE separately. Either enantiomers were not detected in brain, spleen, muscle, and fat. Plasma concentration-time curves were best described by an open three-compartment model, and the toxicokinetic parameters of the two enantiomers were significantly different. Different metabolism behaviors were observed in the degradations of FE and FA in the plasma and liver microsomes in vitro, which were helpful for understanding the stereoselective mechanism. This work suggested the stereoselective behaviors of chiral pollutants, and their chiral metabolites in environment {{should be taken into}} account for an accurate risk assessment.

40|$|The {{repetitive}} use of herbicides {{of a given}} mode {{of action}} as primary tools to control weeds in simplified cropping systems {{has led to the}} development of resistant populations. This study reports preliminary results of the infestation level and the herbicide resistance structure of blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.) in circa 40 neighboring fields in each of three locations in Southern Germany during 2010 - 2012. In each location one field with confirmed field resistance served as a starting point to survey the surrounding fields. Field infestation was assessed at the end of the season where seeds were harvested. Based on greenhouse biotests nearly all tested fields showed resistance to ACCase, but the pattern of ACCase mutations and metabolic resistance to <b>fenoxaprop-ethyl</b> showed differences according to space and time. High resistance to ALS was found in several fields in two locations where ALS-resistance was previously confirmed in a single field only leading to severe crop failure. Interestingly, either Pro 197 or Trp 574 seemed to dominate in these two locations, while almost no ALS target-site mutations were found in the third location. Target-site mutations appear to be the major mechanism for these early cases of ALS-resistance. A few fields also showed non-target site resistant plants to mesosulfuron-methyl. This unique data set provides new insights into the structure and development of 1) an established resistance (ACCase-inhibitors) and 2) a developing resistance (ALS-inhibitors). Multivariate analysis including greenhouse biotests data and target-site analyses corresponding to mutations conferring resistance showed that even spatially closely related fields develop different herbicide resistance patterns. This suggests that weed control measures have a major impact within each field and that resistance can evolve independently. In the current situation black-grass infestations can still be controlled in most of the fields. Integrated Weed Management tools can contribute to keep the selection pressure low and slow down resistance development...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria were {{isolated}} from chemically-contaminated soil and the isolates were screened for glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression by spraying with monochlorobimane. The isolate {{with the most}} promising GST activity was later identified as Acinetobacter calcoacticus Y 1 based on its 16 S rRNA gene sequence. By using affinity chromatography, A. calcoaceticus Y 1 putative GST (AcGST) was successfully purified and expressed GST subunit with molecular weight estimated at 23 kDa when analysed on sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The purified protein was then further analysed by using two-dimensional electrophoresis where two putative GST isozymes were identified and designated as AcGST- 1 and AcGST- 2. Upon isoelectric focusing, AcGST- 1 and AcGST- 2 {{were found to be}} in pI values of 4. 5 and 6. 2 respectively. AcGST- 1 and AcGST- 2 were purified by using carboxylmethyl (CM) and diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) ion exchange chromatography respectively. AcGST- 1 was reactive towards ethacrynic acid (EA) (24. 99 ± 1. 24 μmol/min/mg), hydrogen peroxide (3. 93 ± 0. 32 μmol/min/mg), 1 -Chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (CDNB) (0. 61 ± 0. 12 μmol/min/mg), 2, 4 -heptadienal (0. 11 ± 0. 03 μmol/min/mg), trans- 2 -octenal (0. 08 ± 0. 02 μmol/min/mg), and hexadienal (0. 04 ± 0. 003 μmol/min/mg) whereas AcGST- 2 was reactive towards EA (15. 87 ± 2. 54 μmol/min/mg), CDNB (0. 54 ± 0. 13 μmol/min/mg), 2, 4 -heptadienal (0. 08 ± 0. 01 μmol/min/mg), and trans- 2 -octenal (0. 09 ± 0. 01 μmol/min/mg). The substrate specificities of both putative GST isozymes were different and therefore suggesting they were of two existing homodimers. For AcGST- 1, the Vmax for EA and GSH were estimated as 3. 74 ± 1. 40 μmol/min and 1. 46 ± 0. 02 μmol/min, Km for EA and GSH were estimated as 0. 28 ± 0. 02 mM and 0. 01 ± 0. 0003 mM. Whereas for AcGST- 2, the Vmax for EA and GSH were estimated as 8. 41 ± 1. 08 μmol/min and 1. 35 ± 0. 01 μmol/min, Km for EA and GSH were estimated as 0. 28 ± 0. 002 mM and 0. 02 ± 0. 003 mM. From thin layer chromatography to determine the reactivity of both putative GST isozymes towards Isoproturon, <b>Fenoxaprop-ethyl,</b> Propoxur and Clodinafop-propargyl, only AcGST- 2 showed conjugation activity towards Isoproturon, a pesticide. Disc diffusion test indicated that Bromophos, Malathione, DDT, Propoxur, Permethin, Chlorpyrifos, Fenitrothion did not affect the propagation of A. calcoaecticus Y 1 but hydrogen peroxide inhibited the propagation of A. calcoaceticus Y 1.
