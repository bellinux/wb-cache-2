40|$|A splice isoform of the HER 2 {{receptor}} {{that lacks}} exon 16 (<b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2) {{is expressed in}} many HER 2 -positive breast tumors, {{where it has been}} linked with resistance to the HER 2 -targeting antibody trastuzumab, but the impact of <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 on tumor pathobiology and therapeutic response remains uncertain. Here, we provide genetic evidence in transgenic mice that expression of <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 is sufficient to accelerate mammary tumorigenesis and improve the response to trastuzumab. A comparative analysis of effector signaling pathways activated by <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 and wild-type HER 2 revealed that <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 was optimally functional through a link to SRC activation (pSRC). Clinically, HER 2 -positive breast cancers from patients who received trastuzumab exhibited a positive correlation in <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 and pSRC abundance, consistent with the mouse genetic results. Moreover, patients expressing high pSRC or an activated "d 16 HER 2 metagene" were found to derive the greatest benefit from trastuzumab treatment. Overall, our results establish the <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 signaling axis as a signature for decreased risk of relapse after trastuzumab treatment...|$|R
40|$|Almost 90 % {{of human}} primary breast cancers (BCs) express 4 - 9 % of total {{wild-type}} (WT) HER 2 as a splice variant lacking exon 16 (<b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2). Consequent in-frame activating deletion of 2 cysteine residues causes an imbalanced conformation resulting in receptor constitutive homodimerization, enhanced signaling activity, transformation and altered trastuzumab (T) binding. We recently produced a human <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 transgenic (tg) mouse {{characterized by a}} rapid multifocal mammary tumors onset and the expression of active <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 dimers on tumor cells, whose downstream signaling was found coupled to multiple activated nodes that include Src kinase. In order to dissect <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 role in the aggressiveness and in the susceptibility to anti-HER 2 therapy, we focused on the generation of stable <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 -expressing mammary tumor cell lines {{to be used in}} different bioassays. An immunomagnetic purification procedure was applied to generate primary homogeneously <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 -expressing cell cultures. These purified tumor cell lines were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence and their migration/invasion ability was assessed through Boyden chamber test. <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 downstream signaling was evaluated by western blot and T, Lapatinib (L) and Dasatinib (D) drugs sensitivity was measured with WST- 1 and soft-agar bioassays. As controls, we compared in vitro <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 -models oncogenic features to those of the human BC BT 474, which also co-expresses a low amount of <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 transcript (4 %), and to a murine mammary carcinoma cell line (wtHER 2), derived from a primary mammary tumor developed in human WT HER 2 tg mice. We found that <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 in vitro models expressed high levels of stable homodimers combined with the recruitment of activated Src, STAT 3, MAPK and Akt, as in vivo primary mammary tumors. Both in bidimensional (2 D) and matrigel-cultured tumor cells, we confirmed the T lower binding capability for <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 than other anti-HER 2 MAbs directed to different extracellular domain epitopes. <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 tumor cells had an enhanced migratory and invasive capacity compared to wtHER 2 and BT 474 cells and, notably, were completely resistant to T treatment and less responsive to L. In virtue of a highly activated Src kinase expression in <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 -positive models, we tested in 2 D the therapeutic effects of D and observed that <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 -cells were significantly more sensitive than wtHER 2 and BT 474 cells. Preliminary 3 D-drug susceptibility assays showed that the sensitivity of <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 cells increased for all the tested drugs, if assessed in a suitable environment such as soft-agar. Our findings further indicate that the constitutive expression of <b>d</b> 16 <b>HER</b> 2 variant identifies an aggressive tumor phenotype and confirm, at least in vitro in 2 D conditions, that this isoform is resistant to T and L, whereas is sensitive to D. Further analyses are ongoing to analyze in vivo drug sensitivity of d 16 in comparison to WT HER 2 model...|$|R
