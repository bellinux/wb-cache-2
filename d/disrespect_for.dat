5|$|Bart's {{character}} traits of rebelliousness and <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> authority have {{been compared to}} that of America's founding fathers, and he has been described as an updated version of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, rolled into one. In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes Bart as a nihilist, a philosophical position that argues that existence is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.|$|E
5|$|He {{was educated}} in the Episcopal Church, to which he always adhered; and my {{conviction}} is, that he believed in the fundamental doctrines of Christianity as usually taught in that Church, according to his understanding of them; but without a particle of intolerance, or <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> the faith and modes of worship adopted by Christians of other denominations.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community retained a fascination {{for the old}} country {{and their relationship to}} it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed a staple of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E
25|$|While {{still at}} school, Tatchell campaigned {{in favour of}} better {{treatment}} of, and full human rights for, the Aboriginal people of Australia. He believes that Australian cities should be renamed with their original Aboriginal place names, to sever ties with the colonial era. For example, he wants the Tasmanian capital Hobart to be renamed Nibberluna, arguing {{that this would be}} a fitting tribute to Australia's Aboriginal heritage, which he says has been discarded and <b>disrespected</b> <b>for</b> too long.|$|R

5|$|Lundström {{points out}} (p.134) {{that some of}} the {{international}} and national reports took on the features of urban legends. They reflected a prevailing <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, who were portrayed in the newspapers as uncomprehending savages who had killed the three men or showed a deadly indifference to their plight. These speculations were refuted in 1930, upon the discovery of the expedition's final resting place on Kvitøya by the crews of two ships, the Bratvaag and the Isbjørn.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of their trial she {{remained}} calm, complaining through her lawyers alleged <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> the flag while it was being produced as evidence. She loudly protested when the defense suggested that the group might have suffered from mental instability while committing the deed. On June 16, 1954, the jury found all four defendants guilty. On the morning of July 8, 1954, Lebrón learned of her son's death minutes before the sentence was to be announced. She was quiet {{at the beginning of the}} hearing, but at one point, unable to contain herself, she became hysterical. Rover demanded the death penalty, but Holtzoff chose to sentence them to the longest terms of imprisonment possible. In Lebrón's case this was between sixteen and fifty years, depending on her behavior.|$|E

Elvis awakens, after being drugged by the boy, in the boarding house. He and the boy do not get along at first. The boy <b>disrespects</b> <b>for</b> the 70's Elvis saying that he sold out to Vegas. However, the boy and Elvis get to know each other, and they became friends. Elvis even plays [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] with the boy's band at a talent show.|$|R
5|$|The 1941 VFL season {{went ahead}} despite {{the loss of}} many players to {{military}} service. Miller alternated between playing in the backline and in attack depending on match conditions. When St Kilda were kicking downwind, Miller would play in attack, and when they kicked against the wind, {{he would return to}} a defensive position. In the forward line, he alternated with Sam Loxton, a future Invincibles teammate. He booted 28 goals in 16 games, including eight in one match against North Melbourne. Miller also gained a reputation among opponents for kicking them in the ankles. He again showed his <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> authority and reputation. In one match against Melbourne, for whom his boss and state cricket teammate Percy Beames played, Miller charged towards Beames with a raised elbow {{at the start of the}} match, forcing his boss to be taken from the field. Miller came second in St Kilda's best and fairest for 1941 as his team again came second to last.|$|E

25|$|On 22 September 2006, Commodore Bainimarama {{attacked}} {{government policies}} {{in a speech}} at Ratu Latianara Secondary School. News service Fiji Village reported that he claimed that government leniency towards perpetrators of the 2000 coup had created a culture of <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> the law, to which he attributed the increasing incidents of rape, homicide, and desecration of Hindu temples. He also criticized the Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma, for supporting the government.|$|E
5000|$|Vollmer {{was against}} police {{involvement}} {{with the problem of}} drug addiction.

25|$|These {{and other}} good deeds and {{charitable}} {{frame of mind}} completely won {{the hearts and minds}} of the Roman people. They now looked to the papacy for government, ignoring the rump state at Constantinople, which had only <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> Gregory, calling him a fool for his pacifist dealings with the Lombards. The office of urban prefect went without candidates. From the time of Gregory the Great to the rise of Italian nationalism the papacy was most influential presence in Italy.|$|E
25|$|To {{win back}} the {{interest}} in {{and support for the}} Islamic Revolution among the 90% {{of the population of the}} Muslim world that was Sunni, rather than Shia like Khomeini. The Iran–Iraq War had also alienated Sunni, who not only were offended by its bloodshed, but tended to favour Iran's Sunni-led opponent, Iraq. At least one observer speculated that Khomeini's choice of the issue of <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> the Prophet Muhammad was a particularly shrewd tactic, as Sunni were inclined to suspect Shia of being more interested in the Imams Ali and Husayn ibn Ali than in the Prophet.|$|E
25|$|On 27 June 2016 {{a new law}} {{entered in}} force in Transnistria, {{punishing}} actions or public statements, including through the usage of mass media, networks of information and telecommunications or internet, expressing <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> the peace-keeping mission of the Russian Army in the Transnistrian Moldovan Republic or directed to distort the positive role that the Russian Army had there. The punishment is up to 3 years of jail for ordinary people or up to 7 years of jail if the crime was committed by a person of responsibility {{or a group of}} persons by prior agreement.|$|E
50|$|Lineberry {{offers an}} alternative, psychologically and {{functionally}} oriented taxonomy. There are negative themes (<b>disrespect</b> expressed <b>for</b> deities, women, homosexuals, {{the enemy and}} economically deprived comrades; graphic expression of violence perpetrated on women and the enemy, glorification of substance abuse) but also positive (unit pride, encouragement of comrades) and perhaps in-between, expressions of contempt for death and indifference to mortality.|$|R
50|$|These {{resolves}} {{relate to}} the colonists status as British citizens since their emigration from various European countries. Since early settlement, both by virtue of local laws and later Imperial law, alien colonists had been entitled to and were granted equal rights with other native-born British subjects, and this equal treatment should be continued. This is {{in reference to the}} termination of their rights under the Plantation Act 1740 in December 1773, {{about the same time as}} the Boston Tea Party and before passage of the Intolerable Acts. The colonists saw this as limiting their freedom, their ability to grow, and placing them at a lower political and social level than the citizens of Britain. As was the case, this resolve controversially suggests that colonial interpretations of their rights had been <b>disrespected</b> <b>for</b> many years, as well as more recently prior to the opening of the Continental Congress.|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} about reached populations for the obligatory displacement in mining area {{is very little}} debated by Social Sciences and the agencies of the State. However, it is common in biggest mineral enterprises to exist the necessity of withdrawal a contingent of individuals from them lands, for building a territorial order which propitiate {{the functioning of the}} mining activity. These populations are in many cases <b>disrespected</b> <b>for</b> the companies and State, being the grace of capital pressure and strategies on them lands and them way of life. The present paper will focus the questions over the obligatory displacement in mining exploration area in almost every part Brazilian Amazon, giving prominence for the corporation strategies, the social conflicts, the agrarian question and the reached populations. In such a way, will be used as a case of study the bauxite exploration projects in Low Amazon, in the cities of Oriximiná and Juruti, Pará State, where in distinct periods had occurred removes of individuals from them lived and used spaces...|$|R
25|$|Most of the {{characters}} are killed in action {{during the course of}} the movie. Nevertheless, the general atmosphere of the machine gun company is relaxed and business-like throughout the story. The soldiers' continued <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> formalities and discipline is a source of frustration for some of the officers. After all, they are all there just to get the job done. Official propaganda, both their own and that of the enemy, is a source of amusement or an outright offense to them. The movie shifts from time to time to the homefront, showcasing for example Kariluoto marrying his girlfriend at Helsinki Cathedral and Rokka visiting his wife Lyyti and children at their farm on the Karelian Isthmus.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{have also}} drawn {{parallels}} between the Byronic hero and the solipsist heroes of Russian literature. In particular, Alexander Pushkin's famed character Eugene Onegin echoes many of the attributes seen in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, particularly, Onegin's solitary brooding and <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> traditional privilege. The first stages of Pushkin's poetic novel Eugene Onegin appeared twelve years after Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, and Byron was of obvious influence (Vladimir Nabokov argued in his Commentary to Eugene Onegin that Pushkin had read Byron during his years in exile just prior to composing Eugene Onegin). The same character themes continued to influence Russian literature, particularly after Mikhail Lermontov invigorated the Byronic hero through the character Pechorin in his 1839 novel A Hero of Our Time.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} was also unpopular {{with both the}} French and the Italians; the latter in particular felt that the daughter of their king had been sacrificed to an unpopular member of the House of Bonaparte and consequently regarded it as a mésalliance. For France's part, Napoléon Joseph was ill regarded, and had been known {{to carry on a}} number of affairs both before and during his marriage. Their official reception into Paris on 4 February was greeted very coldly by Parisians, not out of <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> a daughter of the king of Sardinia, but instead out of dislike for her new husband. Indeed, all her life public sympathy tended to lean in her favour; she was fondly regarded as retiring, charitable, pious, and trapped in an unhappy marriage.|$|E

For example, cadets are punished if they run during the playing or singing of the Philippine National Anthem. Cadets are {{likewise}} punished even more severely <b>for</b> <b>disrespecting</b> the Philippine flag (letting any portion of the flag touch the ground is worthy of a demotion). Cadets are encouraged to sing the National Anthem with pride. Cadets are also encouraged to recite the Panatang Makabayan and the Panunumpa ng Katapatan sa Watawat, as well as sing their school's alma mater song with zest and valor.|$|R

25|$|The Eighteenth Amendment (1919) {{prohibited}} the making, transporting, and selling of alcoholic beverages nationwide. It also authorized Congress to enact legislation enforcing this prohibition. Adopted {{at the urging}} of a national temperance movement, proponents believed that the use of alcohol was reckless and destructive and that prohibition would reduce crime and corruption, solve social problems, decrease the need for welfare and prisons, and improve the health of all Americans. During prohibition, it is estimated that alcohol consumption and alcohol related deaths declined dramatically. But prohibition had other, more negative consequences. The amendment drove the lucrative alcohol business underground, giving rise to a large and pervasive black market. In addition, prohibition encouraged <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> the law and strengthened organized crime. Prohibition came to an end in 1933, when this amendment was repealed.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Brownback, {{however it}} died in Congress {{sometime}} in the next year. The bill was introduced based on the findings that science has progressed {{to the point where the}} human and nonhuman species can be merged to create new forms of life. Because of this serious ethical issues arise as this blurs the line between humans and other animals, and according to the bill with this blurring of the lines comes a show of <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> human dignity. The final claim brought up in The Human Chimera Prohibition Act was that there is an increasing amount of zoonotic diseases and the creation of human-animal chimeras can allow these diseases to reach humans. Since the bill's death in congress there has not been another attempt at setting regulations on chimera research in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{uncontrolled}} public {{decisions have}} led to poor outcomes and <b>disrespect</b> <b>for</b> the decision-makers. Such decisions also lacked the regularity and transparency that distinguish them from the mere say-so of public authorities. On such grounds, there are obvious benefits for the disclosure of reasons for decisions. First, procedural participation by people affected by a decision promotes {{the rule of law}} by making it more difficult for the public authority to act arbitrarily. Requiring the giving of reasons helps ensure that decisions are carefully thought through, which in turn aids in the control of administrative discretion. Secondly, accountability makes it necessary for the public authority {{to face up to the}} people affected by a decision. When a public authority acts on all the relevant considerations, this increases the probability of better decision outcomes and, as such, is beneficial to public interests. Another important benefit is that respect for decision-makers is fostered, which increases their integrity in the public's eyes.|$|E
