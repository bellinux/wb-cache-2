25|$|By 1967, {{there were}} nine Polish Americans in Congress {{including}} four from the Chicago area. The three best known were Democrats who specialized in foreign policy, taxes and environmentalism. Clement J. Zablocki of Milwaukee served 1949–83, and became chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee from 1977 {{until his death in}} 1983; although liberal on domestic issues, he was a hawk regarding the Vietnam War. Dan Rostenkowski served 1959–95, and became chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, which writes the tax laws. His father was an influential alderman and party leader from the center of Polonia on the Northwest side of Chicago. Even more influential has been <b>John</b> <b>Dingell</b> of Detroit, who was first elected to Congress in 1955 and is still there (with the second longest tenure on record). A liberal Democrat known for hard-hitting investigations, Dingell has been a major voice in economic, energy, medical and environmental issues. His father John D. Dingell, Sr. held the same seat in Congress from 1933 to 1955. He was the son of Marie and Joseph A. Dzieglewicz, Polish immigrants.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the last}} section of his dissent Blackmun found some {{prospect}} for relief. Rep. <b>John</b> <b>Dingell</b> of Michigan, then chair of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, had had similar concerns {{and was surprised to}} hear the SEC take the opposite position in its amicus brief from what its representatives had consistently told his subcommittee. He advised lower courts to [...] "take seriously their duty to review the results of arbitration to the extent possible under the Arbitration Act." [...] In fact, he concluded, he foresaw more investors bringing such complaints to their attention. [...] "It is thus ironic that the Court's decision, no doubt animated by its desire to rid the federal courts of these suits, actually may increase litigation about arbitration." ...|$|E
2500|$|Democrats {{call for}} [...] "affordable and quality health care," [...] and many {{advocate}} {{an expansion of}} government intervention in this area.

Some Democrats, such as Representatives John Conyers and <b>John</b> <b>Dingell,</b> have called for a single-payer program of Medicare for All. The Progressive Democrats of America, a group operating inside the Democratic Party, has made single-payer universal health care one of their primary policy goals. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, {{has been one of the}} most significant pushes for universal health care to become a reality.

His chief design engineer Walther Reidel became the subject of a December 1946 article [...] "German Scientist Says American Cooking Tasteless; Dislikes Rubberized Chicken", exposing the presence of von Braun's team in the country and drawing criticism from Albert Einstein and <b>John</b> <b>Dingell.</b> Requests to improve their living conditions such as laying linoleum over their cracked wood flooring were rejected. Von Braun remarked, [...] "at Peenemünde we had been coddled, here you were counting pennies". At Peenemünde, von Braun had thousands of engineers who answered to him, but was now answering to [...] "pimply" [...] 26-year-old Major Jim Hamill who possessed an undergraduate degree in engineering. His loyal Germans still addressed him as Herr Professor, but Hamill addressed him as Wernher and never bothered to respond to von Braun's request for more materials, and every proposal for new rocket ideas was dismissed.|$|E
