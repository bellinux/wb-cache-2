40|$|International audienceNew {{generation}} of rotary transfer machines processing different models of parts is considered. In order {{to enhance the}} costeffectiveness of mixed-model rotary transfer machines, the problems of process planning for the parts to be machined and the configuration of a rotary transfer machine are integrated in the same optimisation problem. This problem is modelled as a combinatorial optimisation problem. The decisions to be taken simultaneously concern the orientation of parts for machining, the machining parameters for processing the parts {{as well as the}} configuration of machining units to be used at working positions of the machine. Constraints related to the design of such units – spindle <b>heads,</b> <b>turrets</b> – and working positions, as well as precedence constraints related to machining operations, are taken into account. The problem consists in minimising an estimated cost of the rotary transfer machine, while reaching a given output and satisfying all the constraints. The proposed methods to solve theproblem are based on its MIP formulation. The optimisation techniques are validated on an industrial case study. Numericalexperiments evaluate the efficiency of the approach against the variety of parts to be produced...|$|R

40|$|In {{the process}} of turning require power, in which the power {{obtained}} from electrical energy. The electrical energy is then converted into mechanical energy via an electric motor. How much power the electric motor is determined by several factors, among others: cutting speed, depth of cut, motion eating, cutting time and cutting tool material. In modern lathe used system {{is to make the}} gear head gear as the transmission power is driven by an electric motor. So that there is a relationship between the electric motor power on a lathe with head gear system to the cutting depth on a lathing process. The process of turning the workpiece AISI 1020 BHN 175, carbide tool with cutting tool angle of 300, cutting speeds of 300 fpm, motion eat 0. 025 ipr, with variations in the depth of cut of 0. 1 mm, 0, 2 mm, 0. 3 mm, 0. 4 mm, 0. 5 mm, 0. 6 mm and 0. 7 mm obtained will power the electric motors that vary according to the depth of cuts. The results of a theoretical analysis of the power requirements of gear <b>head</b> lathe <b>turret</b> with a variation of the cutting depth can be concluded that the theory obtained vary linearly extending line y = 2, 6423 x.

40|$|This thesis {{explains}} the model-based {{design of a}} fork control system in a <b>turret</b> <b>head</b> operated Very Narrow Aisle forklift in order to evaluate and push {{the limits of the}} current hardware architecture. The <b>turret</b> <b>head</b> movement consists of two separate motions, traversing and rotation, which both are hydraulically actuated. The plant is thoroughly modeled in the Mathworks softwares Simulink/Simscape to assist {{in the design of the}} control system. The control system is designed in Simulink/Stateflow and code-generated to be evaluated in the actual forklift. Optimal control theory is used to generate a minimum-jerk trajectory for auto-rotation, that is simultaneous traversing and rotation with the load kept in centre. The new control system is able to control the system within the positioning requirements of +/- 10 mm and +/- 9 mrad for traversing and rotation, respectively. It also shows good overall performance in terms of robustness since it has been tested and validated with different loads and on different versions of the forklift. However, the study also shows that the non-linearities of the system, especially in the hydraulic proportional valves, causes problems in a closed-loop control system. The work serves as a proof of concept for model-based development at the company since the development time of the new control system was significantly lower than for the original control system...|$|R

The tank formed Omegas head and torso, while the rocket split into his forearms, the launchpad cage and the curved sections of the rails formed his backpack, and the straight sections of the rails and the base of the launchpad cage formed his lower legs and feet. In robot mode, Omegas motor enabled him to walk.|$|R

50|$|As with Arrowhead Game Studios's {{previous}} title Magicka friendly fire, {{the ability}} to harm teammates, is always on, {{and there is no}} way to disable the feature. Not only can players' personal weapons harm teammates, but so can air support and turrets they deploy. Players' thoughtlessly deployed vehicles and supply drops can also crush themselves or teammates. This requires the players to carefully plan their actions during the game's many chaotic combat sequences. There are ways to work around friendly fire: some weapons can launch over teammates' <b>heads,</b> and some <b>turrets</b> can be upgraded to stop shooting when players enter the line of fire. But player skill is still the main solution.|$|R

6000|$|But the Earl of Etherington's merits {{were not}} {{confined}} to his external appearance; for, had his better fortunes failed him, his deserts, like those of Hamlet, might have got him a fellowship in a cry of players. He presented, though in dumb show, the pragmatic conceit of Bottom, to the infinite amusement of all present, especially {{of those who were}} well acquainted with the original; and when he was [...] "translated" [...] by Puck, he bore the ass's head, his newly-acquired dignity, with an appearance of conscious greatness, which made the metamorphosis, though in itself sufficiently farcical, irresistibly comic. He afterwards displayed the same humour in his frolics with the fairies, and the intercourse which he held with Messrs. Cobweb, Mustard-seed, Pease-blossom, and the rest of Titania's cavaliers, who lost all command of their countenances at the gravity with which he invited them to afford him the luxury of scratching his hairy snout. Mowbray had also found a fitting representative for Puck in a queer-looking, small-eyed boy of the Aultoun of St. Ronan's, with large ears projecting from his <b>head</b> like <b>turrets</b> from a Gothic building. This exotic animal personified the merry and mocking spirit of Hobgoblin with considerable power, so that the group bore some resemblance to the well-known and exquisite delineation of Puck by Sir Joshua, in the select collection of the Bard of Memory. It was, however, the ruin of the St. Ronan's Robin Goodfellow, who did no good afterwards,--"gaed an ill gate," [...] as Meg Dods said, and [...] "took on" [...] with a party of strolling players.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDesign {{problems}} {{constitute the}} first stage in developing a machining transfer line. This paper is concerned with a problem in which a transfer line has to be designed in an optimal way to produce parts of different types. Each part of a specific type requires {{a unique set of}} operations to be executed on the stations. Parts move along the stations in the same direction one after another in a given sequence, and a station is set up if at least one operation is executed on this station. Setup costs and times are part-type dependent. Each operation has its size, which is the number of standard tools required to perform this operation, and its processing time. Operations on the same part assigned to the same station are performed sequentially. Re-design, i. e., re-assignment of operations when switching from one type part to another is not allowed. Precedence relations are given on the superset of all operations. There is an upper bound on the total size of operations assigned to the same station, and an upper bound on the time that a part of a given type stays on the same station for all types. The primary objective is to minimize the number of stations. The secondary objective is to minimize the total setup cost. We establish computational complexity of various special cases of this problem, present constructive heuristic algorithms, integer linear programs as well as computational results. These results are applicable in designing transfer lines for mechanical parts manufacturing by multi-spindle <b>turret</b> <b>heads</b> in situations where the station costs are the primary concern and the station setup costs are the secondary concern of the designer...|$|R
