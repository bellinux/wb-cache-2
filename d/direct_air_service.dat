2500|$|Partially due to McMaster's intervention, the {{original}} plans for air-taxi work and joyriding gave way for airmail services, which would link {{communication in the}} settlements between Darwin and Longreach. McMaster summarised it as [...] "an aerial mail service from Longreach to Port Darwin, connecting at Winton, Cloncurry, Avon Downs, Anthony Lagoon, Newcastle Waters and The Katherine", therefore making it the longest <b>direct</b> <b>air</b> <b>service</b> {{in the world at}} that time. Another plan for Qantas came forth with Dr Frederick Archibald Michod, a doctor and aviator in Longreach who became foundation director of Qantas after its formation. Visiting cattle stations and private properties to give medical treatment, Michod was aware of the difficulties faced in the outback. Establishing a hospital in Longreach, he often used his aircraft as an aerial ambulance.

In early 1967, Kỳ sent Có to Taiwan, ostensibly to represent the junta at a ceremony to opening <b>direct</b> <b>air</b> <b>services</b> from Taipei to Saigon. In the meantime, Kỳ made a state visit to Australia.

Có expressed a desire to return to Saigon, but was threatened with arrest and trial, and soldiers were deployed to the airport. Có spent three years in exile in Hong Kong. When President Thiệu sidelined Kỳ from real power, he allowed Có to return to South Vietnam in 1970. Có stayed away from politics and worked as a commercial banker and then as a businessman.|$|R
40|$|Scotland’s location, limited {{population}} size and absence of major base carriers have served to constrain {{the development of}} <b>direct</b> international <b>air</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Air</b> <b>service</b> liberalisation has altered {{the degree to which}} different segments of the international passenger market are served at each airport. Overall, <b>air</b> <b>service</b> provision has been enhanced by the activities of Ryanair at Prestwick, long-haul airlines operating to Glasgow and the use of regional jets by franchise carriers at Aberdeen and Edinburgh.

2500|$|Askin's {{government}} {{was marked by}} strong opposition {{to an increase in}} Commonwealth powers, a tough stance on [...] "law and order" [...] issues, laissez-faire economic policies, and aggressive support for industrial and commercial development. At his first Cabinet meeting, Askin restored <b>direct</b> <b>air</b> <b>services</b> between Sydney and Dubbo, and required Joern Utzon, the Danish architect then working on the Sydney Opera House, to provide a final price and completion date for the Opera House, which had gone past the original estimates for both. His Public Works Minister Davis Hughes began to assert control over the project and demanded that costs be reined in. This brought him into direct conflict with Utzon and in February 1966, after a bitter standoff and the suspension of progress payments by Hughes, Utzon resigned, sparking a major public outcry. Two weeks after the first Government meeting, the Askin Government abolished the tow-away system for Sydney and Newcastle. In 1966 the University of New South Wales awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters (D.Litt).|$|R

40|$|Historically, marine {{routes to}} Cyprus were {{important}} modes of travel from mainland Europe and the UK. Today the dominant mode is via air and much faster travel times are achieved. This paper compares and contrasts the overall CO 2 emissions and costs - {{in time and}} monetary units - per passenger, for overland travel modes from the UK and Russia to Cyprus, in order to illustrate potential slow-tourist routes. Hypothetical routes are constructed, using potentially slow modes of travel via a mixture of overland rail and then by sea. A number of sea ports are considered as departure points including the main historic ports of Marseilles, Naples, and Odessa with origins linked to major cities such as London, Paris, Milan, Rome, and Moscow. These rail-sea journeys are then compared to <b>direct</b> <b>air</b> <b>services.</b> Some cost estimates are also considered. These slower routes {{may not be as}} ‘green’ (e. g. lower carbon content) as initially thought but could become more popular and could therefore contribute to lower emissions for tourists when compared to more typical air transport based routes. The paper gives some indication as to which routes are ‘slow’ and which are low emissions, and also gives some potential ideas where and how emissions savings could be made...|$|R
50|$|Imperial Airways ordered eight {{aircraft}} {{which had}} all been delivered by 1933. The first service was flown from Croydon Airport to Brussels and then Cologne on 26 September 1932.

Three other aircraft joined it in South Africa to fly the service between Cape Town and Kisumu, although they proved to be {{too small for the}} traffic.

50|$|Due to the {{proximity}} of the two airports, the railway journey time would only take around twenty or so minutes and shorten the minimum connection time (MCT) between the flights.
