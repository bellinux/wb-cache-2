2500|$|Large assortments offer {{consumers}} many benefits, notably increased {{choice and}} the possibility that the consumer will be able to locate the ideal product. However, for the retailer, larger assortments incur costs in terms of record-keeping, managing <b>inventory,</b> <b>pricing</b> and risks associated with wastage due to spoiled, shopworn or unsold stock. Carrying more stock also exposes the retailer to higher risks in terms of slow-moving stock and lower sales per square foot of store space. [...] On the other hand, reducing the number of product lines can generate cost savings through increased stock turnover by eliminating slow-moving lines, fewer stockouts, increased bargaining power with suppliers, reduced costs associated with wastage and carrying inventory, and higher sales per square foot which means more efficient space utilisation.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the operational decisions and resulting profits for {{a supply chain}} facing price-dependent demand under a policy where there is an ex-ante commitment made on the retail price markup. We obtain closed-form solutions for this policy under the assumption of a multiplicative demand function and we analytically compare its performance {{with that of a}} traditional price-only policy. We compare these results to results obtained when demand follows a linear additive form. These formulations are shown to be qualitatively different as the manufacturer's wholesale pricing decision is independent of the retail price markup commitment in the multiplicative case, but not when demand is linear additive. We demonstrate that the ex-ante commitment can lead to Pareto-improving solutions under linear additive demand, but not under the multiplicative demand function. We also consider the effect of pricing power in the supply chain by varying who determines the retail price markup. Supply chain management <b>Inventory</b> <b>Pricing...</b>|$|E
40|$|Manufacturers and {{suppliers}} offer temporary reductions (or permanent increases) {{in the price}} charged to the resellers {{for a variety of}} reasons. The trade promotion may be offered to the reseller at a single point in time or over a finite time-span. In addition, in reselling situations, the end demand tends to be sensitive to selling price. It is commonly found that under such trade promotion (or in stockpiling to an announced price increase), not all the quantity purchased by the reseller at discount may be passed on to the final consumer at a reduced selling price. In fact, previous studies have shown that it is optimal for the reseller to carry forward some of the quantity purchased at discount and sell it later at the regular price. It has been suggested in the literature that by placing a restriction on the reseller's purchase quantity, the supplier can restrict the reseller's forward buy quantity. In this paper, we evaluate this approach. In the rest of the paper, we present alternate schemes which are easy to administer and which insure that the supplier avoids the spike in demand that occurs in the unconstrained problem. <b>Inventory,</b> <b>pricing,</b> promotion, forward buying, coordination...|$|E

40|$|Replenishment and pricing {{strategies}} are traditionally determined by entirely separate units of a firm, the former by {{production and the}} latter by marketing. In a large organization production and marketing are traditionally {{measured in terms of}} performance criteria appropriate and relevant within the world in which they operate, rather than in terms of overall company performance. We consider a situation where the headquarters uses a simple linear transfer price between the two functions to govern the transactions. The misaligned incentives among these functional managers are caused by a transfer price between them that distorts the marginal production cost and revenue, as well as by a misallocation of cost: Marketing's pricing strategy influences expected leftover inventory, but only production incurs the cost. The misalignment can be mitigated through the following two ways. First, if production commits to a service level instead of an inventory level, both production and marketing, and hence the firm as a whole, are better off. Second, the same improvement can be achieved through organizational changes so that marketing becomes the dominant function. We also propose a mechanism that aligns the functional managers' incentives to be compatible to the firm. <b>inventory,</b> <b>pricing,</b> coordination, manufacturing/marketing interface...|$|E

This problem is faced in various industries including retail, airlines, automobile, apparel, hotels and car rentals. Our contributions are twofold. First, we provide a closed form solution for the special case of exponential price response where the elasticity parameter of the demand function of all products are equal. Second, we develop two classes of dynamic pricing heuristics: one using the value approximation approach of dynamic programming and the other using the deterministic version of the problem. Our numerical analysis indicates that dynamic pricing yields significantly higher revenues compared to fixed price policies.

These derivative markets continuously value petroleum delivered today and for future dates, providing a market price for inventories. Underground petroleum reserves are also an inventory defined by exploration surveys and development drilling. Thus, observable market {{information can be}} used to value these reserves. Option - valuation models {{can be used to}} price reserves using observable markets, but are dependent on unexplained convenience yields revealed by the term structure of futures prices. The authors apply a general <b>inventory</b> <b>pricing</b> model to petroleum inventories and generate an empirical model of the returns to storage for petroleum markets. They examine the determinants of the crude oil convenience yield using a stochastic control model. They specify optimal production and inventory conditions using a third-order cost function and estimate them using monthly observations. Their inventory arbitrage condition embodies the Hotelling principle and Kaldor's convenience yield, and includes a premium on the dispersion in crude oil prices. The empirical results suggest that returns to storage contain both a cost-reducing component and often sizable premiums associated with the dispersion of petroleum prices. Their findings suggest that crude oil markets differentiated by quality and location provide similar premiums. The premiums associated with the dispersion of petroleum prices may account for persistent backwardation in crude oil prices. This finding may also explain the wide discrepancies between Hotelling values and transaction prices found in previous studies.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} managing inventories and dynamically adjusting retailer prices in distribution systems with geographically dispersed retailers. More specifically, we analyze the following single item, periodic review model. The distribution of demand in each period, at a given retailer, depends on the item's price according to a stochastic demand function. These stochastic demand functions may vary by retailer and by period. The replenishment process consists of two phases: In some or all periods, a distribution center may place an order with an outside supplier. This order arrives at the distribution center after an Üorder leadtimeÝ and is then, in the second phase, allocated to the retailers. Allocations arrive after a second Üallocation leadtime. Ý We develop an approximate model that is tractable and in which an optimal policy of simple structure exists. The approximate model thus provides analytically computable approximations for systemwide profits and other performance measures. Moreover, the approximate model allows us to prove how various components of the optimal strategy (i. e., prices and order-up-to levels) respond to shifts in the model parameters, e. g., to shifts in the retailers' demand functions. In addition, we develop combined pricing, ordering, and allocation strategies and show that the system's performance under these strategies is well gauged by the above approximations. We use this model {{to assess the impact}} of different types of geographic dispersion on systems with dynamically varying prices and how different system parameters (e. g., leadtimes, coefficients of variation of individual retailers' demand, price elasticities) contribute to this impact. Similarly, we use the model to gauge the benefits of coordinated replenishments under dynamic pricing, and how these benefits increase as the allocation decisions of the systemwide orders to individual retailers are postponed to a later point in the overall replenishment leadtime. We report on a comprehensive numerical study based on data obtained from a nationwide department store chain. <b>inventory,</b> <b>pricing</b> strategies, two-echelon system...|$|E
40|$|Incorporating {{demographic}} variables in brand choice models is conceptually appealing and has numerous managerial benefits. Retailers and brand managers can assess geodemographic variations in demand and marketing mix response {{in order to}} implement micromarketing strategies. For example, a retailer planning to locate a new outlet can get {{some sense of the}} differences in demand patterns and price and promotion sensitivities in the new trading area in order to make initial stocking, <b>inventory,</b> <b>pricing,</b> and promotion decisions. For existing outlets, retailers can fine tune the assortment and merchandising activities in a category to match local market conditions. Similarly, a packaged goods manufacturers would benefit from getting a sense of whether they should stress promotional activity for one part of a brand's product line in some retail trading areas, {{and other parts of the}} brand's line in other retail trading areas. Unfortunately, a general finding across existing studies is that the impact of {{demographic variables}} on brand choice is neither strong nor consistent. These findings are puzzling given that one would expect certain demographic variables, such as income, to have some influence on brand choice behavior. Moreover, Hoch et al. (Hoch, S. J., B. D. Kim, A. J. Montgomery, P. E. Rossi. 1995. Determinants of store-level price elasticity. (February) 17 – 29.), using store level data, find that a relatively small set of demographic variables is much more influential than competitive variables in explaining differences in price sensitivity across retail trading areas. In light of such contradictory findings, there is a need for a better conceptualization of the role of income and other demographic variables in household purchasing, and this is the primary objective of this study. This paper presents a microeconomic-based framework called the “indivisible alternatives” (IDA) framework to model household brand choice. A key aspect of the IDA framework is that it explicitly models alternatives in the market as being indivisible, while past work has either explicitly or implicitly assumed perfect divisibility. Indivisibilities force a household's selection of a brand size and its level of category expenditure into a single joint decision. Hence, demographic variables that influence category expenditure (e. g., income) also influence the choice of a brand size. In addition, since alternatives in the category come in several discrete sizes, indivisibilities introduce differences in holding costs in the choice of a brand-size combination. Consequently, demographic factors that influence holding costs through consumption rate differences (e. g., household size) impact the choice of a brand size in a product category. In this manner, indivisibilities in market offerings naturally lead to differences in choice behavior across households that can be linked to demographic factors in a logical fashion. In empirical applications to two different scanner panel data sets (ketchup and ground coffee), the proposed framework compares favorably with two benchmark specifications in terms of both goodness of fit and predictive validity. The results from these product categories indicate that a household's price sensitivity is inversely related to its income level, and that factors such as household size and seasonality, which are likely to influence consumption rates, make households more or less willing to buy larger package sizes. Income elasticity estimates from the model confirm that, ceteris paribus, households with lower incomes will have a higher propensity to purchase private labels and generic brands, and a lower propensity to purchase national brands, compared with households with higher incomes. The micromarketing potential of the IDA framework is explored in market simulations conducted for two different zip codes within a metropolitan area that vary with respect to income levels and other demographic factors. The results indicate that for the product categories studied, there are substantial differences across market areas in their response to the retail promotion of very large and very small package sizes within the same brand's product line. The differences in response suggest that it may be beneficial to customize promotional programs to market areas based on their underlying demographic composition. Finally, our findings suggest a link between household income and deal proneness that is conditional on other demographic variables and the expenditure required for the brand size in question. Specifically, we find that smaller households with lower income levels are more likely to respond to promotions for smaller, less expensive items within a category, while larger households with higher incomes are more likely to respond to promotions for larger, more expensive items within a category. brand choice, demographic variables, geodemographics, micromarketing, deal proneness, private labels...|$|E

Redressing the empirical linkage between volatility, <b>prices,</b> and <b>inventories</b> {{is important because}} volatility increases returns to inventories, which in turn may imply prices. The problem is also important from the regulator perspective, because publicly funded inventory programs have been traditional measures in stabilizing prices and improving food security by providing a buffer against adverse yield shocks and stock-outs. The structural model underlying the estimating equations {{is based on a}} dynamic inventory optimization problem. The data suggest that the price of both wheat and wheat inventories is nonstationary and that they are significantly linked {{to each other in the}} short run but do not exhibit a stationary long-run equilibrium relationship. Price volatility is an important determinant in the short-run conditional mean processes for both the <b>price</b> and <b>inventories.</b> The pairwise causal relationships have only one direction each. <b>Inventories</b> imply <b>price</b> volatility, price volatility implies price, and <b>price</b> implies <b>inventories,</b> but not vice versa.
