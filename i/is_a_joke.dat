5|$|When Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are {{watching}} Itchy & Scratchy, Marge says {{they watch the}} same episodes all the time, while Lisa says that the Itchy & Scratchy cartoons are just pasted together from pieces of old episodes. This comment <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about the construction of this episode; the blackboard and couch gags are taken from other episodes, there are clips from past episodes, and the interstitials are actually clips from past episodes that feature the family members talking in the kitchen. These three aspects {{support the idea of}} this episode being a clip show to the extreme.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour is {{a parody}} of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows. Mainly it is {{a parody of}} The Brady Bunch Hour, a {{short-lived}} spin-off of the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch. The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of Jan Brady in the Brady Bunch Hour when Eve Plumb refused to participate. The Simpson family is {{made to look like}} The Partridge Family. Also, the segment holds numerous references to Laugh-In. Kent Brockman introduces the show from inside a broadcast booth in a style similar to Laugh-In, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> wall similar to the one in Laugh-In where The Sea Captain opens a porthole. There is also a Laugh-In-like montage wherein other characters comment on the skit itself. When Hans Moleman reads a poem, it is based on Henry Gibson reading a poem on Laugh-In. Other shows parodied during the variety show include The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.|$|E

Charlie gets jealous when she ignores him at lunch and makes {{arrangements}} to meet Richard after school to discuss time travel with him. When she tells him her secret, at first he thinks it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> But, what she said about him and the world would come from someone who had knowledge about the future. Peggy has decided to break up with Charlie'; she is the only one who wants that.|$|E

The prince tells his brother about his blessing, but his brother think it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> The two travel to the maggid of Koznit so that the brother can get prayer for his ill son. They are told to leave by the maggid and the son dies before they make it home.|$|E

Belle's fiancée, Gaston (Sage Brocklebank), and her father are against the terms but Belle agrees. At his castle, Rumpelstiltskin gives Belle a list of tasks, including skinning the children that he hunts for their pelts. At this Belle drops and chips a teacup in shock, but he explains that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> and doesn't mind about the chipped cup.|$|E
500|$|Ben Sisario {{criticized the}} album in the Rolling Stone Album Guide, writing that [...] "the {{whole thing was}} some bland divine plan" [...] and asking, [...] "Is this man's final dis of God, or His of us?" [...] Some critics {{perceived}} the spiritual element of the storyline to be a joke or stunt. Allmusic writer Bradley Torreano wrote that [...] "Even if it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> it isn't a funny one, or even a clever one." [...] In September 2003, Insane Clown Posse was voted the worst band of any musical genre in Blender, with The Wraith: Shangri-La named as the group's worst album. However, the magazine also gave the album a positive review for its [...] "charming, good-natured idiocy".|$|E
500|$|The Beauty Process also {{contains}} heavier songs that {{are reminiscent of}} the band's previous albums. The song [...] "Drama" [...] features a guitar solo played with a Micro Jammers' toy guitar. Sparks explained that she was getting frustrated with it, commenting [...] "Fuck it, I can't play these riffs, let the Micro Jammers do it for $1.99." [...] The song was described by Spin as [...] " [...] off like Helmet sans pretentious time signatures". The track [...] "Bad Things" [...] was described as [...] "a full-throttle blast of urban paranoia", while [...] "The Masses Are Asses" [...] deals with social outrage and rude humor. The album's title refers to two different things: the first part, [...] "The Beauty Process", is what Sparks would call [...] "putting my fright makeup on before a show", while the second part, [...] "Triple Platinum", <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about L7's career as the band had yet to reach gold status.|$|E

[...] The intended symbolism of the campaign was not that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> but that the political system <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, John Cleese {{confirmed}} {{that he had}} been learning German for a while and described himself as [...] "speaking simple German fluently now". Referring to the Fawlty Towers episode [...] "The Germans", he explained [...] "Everybody thinks that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about the Germans but they missed it. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about British attitudes to the war and the fact that some people were still hanging on to that rubbish".|$|R
500|$|In their {{original}} pitch to Fox, Groening and Cohen {{stated that they}} wanted the futuristic setting for the show to be neither [...] "dark and drippy" [...] like Blade Runner, nor [...] "bland and boring" [...] like The Jetsons. They felt {{that they could not}} make the future either a utopia or a dystopia because either option would eventually become boring. The creators gave careful consideration to the setting, and the influence of classic science fiction is evident in this episode as a series of references to—and parodies of—easily recognizable films, books and television programs. In the earliest glimpse of the future while Fry is frozen in the cryonic chamber, time is seen passing outside the window until reaching the year 3000. This scene was inspired by a similar scene in the film The Time Machine based on H.G. Wells' novel. When Fry awakens in the year 2999, he is greeted with Terry's catchphrase [...] "Welcome to the world of tomorrow". The scene <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> at the expense of Futuramas namesake, the Futurama ride at the 1939 World's Fair whose tag line was [...] "The World of Tomorrow". Dick Clark made a cameo as a [...] head in a jar, hosting Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 3000.|$|E
500|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket {{has been}} called a concept album chronicling {{adolescence}} and associated feelings. The band did not consider them explicitly teenage songs: [...] "The things that happen to you in high school are the same things that happen your entire life," [...] said Hoppus. [...] "You can fall in love at sixty; you can get rejected at eighty." [...] The record begins with [...] "Anthem Part Two", which touches on disenchantment and blames adults for teenage problems. It serves as the opposite of the band's typical [...] "party" [...] image presented to the media, with heavily politically-charged lyrics. Joe Shooman called it a [...] "generational manifesto that exhorts kids to be wary of the system that surrounds them". [...] "Online Songs" [...] was written by Hoppus about [...] "the thoughts that drive you crazy" [...] {{in the aftermath of a}} breakup, and is essentially a follow-up to [...] "Josie". [...] "First Date" [...] was inspired by DeLonge and wife Jennifer Jenkins' first date at SeaWorld in San Diego. [...] "I was about 21 at the time and it was an excuse for me to take her somewhere because I wanted to hang out with her," [...] said DeLonge. The track was written as a summary of neurotic teen angst and awkwardness. [...] "Happy Holidays, You Bastard" [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> track intended to [...] "piss parents off." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Story of a Lonely Guy", concerns heartache and rejection prior to the high school prom. The song is downbeat and melancholy, filtered through [...] "tuneful guitar lines reminiscent of The Cure and hefty drum patterns".|$|E
500|$|As cricket {{correspondent}} for the Yorkshire Post, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described his writing style: he wrote [...] "with a fountain pen on press telegram forms at 60 or 80 words a shilling. At the close of play he immediately concluded his essay; he hardly ever crossed anything out. His cricketing judgments were assured and rigorous, his style exact but sometimes elegant: Leyland's bowling <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> {{but it is an}} extremely practical joke." [...] The Times stated that his reports were [...] "always precise, frequently elegant, sometimes stern and invariably fair and accurate. He never wrote an unpolished piece or an unidentifiable one, although he was only occasionally analytical." [...] The speed and ease with which he produced his reports, and his refusal to use a typewriter—which he described as [...] "the devil's own invention"—were envied by other journalists. Kilburn's writing was printed exactly as he wrote it; sub-editors did not touch anything, even if he had made a mistake, as his employers valued his style so greatly. He refused to write about off-field events which caused consternation for his editors as Yorkshire cricket was turbulent behind the scenes at the time he wrote. Nor would he write about the wider aspects of cricket, confident that his reputation made it impossible to sack him. This attitude made him popular with the players, and he became particularly close to Len Hutton and Donald Bradman. His position at the Yorkshire Post gave him freedom to write about whatever he chose, and he refused several offers to move to national newspapers. But his obituary in The Times suggested that, had he worked for a London publication, he would have been as well-known and respected as Cardus, E. W. Swanton and R. C. Robertson-Glasgow.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{crossovers}} {{are part}} of canon. Most, however, are outside of the continuity of a character's regular title or series of stories. They can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> <b>a</b> gag, a dream sequence, or even a [...] "what if" [...] scenario (such as DC's Elseworlds).|$|R
500|$|On February 19, 2006, Yankovic {{began working}} on the album's parodies. During these sessions, three parodies were recorded; the first of these, [...] "Canadian Idiot", is a play on [...] "American Idiot" [...] by Green Day. It is a satirical {{commentary}} on American nationalism and the stereotypical American view of Canadians. The song is ironic, and Yankovic has stated that the song's anger <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> and that he loves Canada. Next, Yankovic {{began working on}} [...] "Trapped in the Drive-Thru", a parody of R. Kelly's [...] "Trapped in the Closet". Yankovic was inspired to pen the spoof after hearing the [...] "brilliant and wonderful and ridiculous" [...] original. Efforts to make the parody more convoluted than the original were first considered but then abandoned by Yankovic; he eventually reasoned, however, {{that he could make}} his version [...] "a little more stupid". Thus, the song is an excruciatingly detailed narrative about a couple getting hamburgers at the drive-thru, which was [...] "the most banal thing [...] could think of at the time." [...] Because the song was three times the length of a normal song, legally, Yankovic would have been required to pay thrice the statutory rate for royalties. This in turn would have forced Yankovic to remove one of his parodies from the album. However, R. Kelly allowed Yankovic to only pay the royalty rate for one song. To round out the first session, Yankovic recorded [...] "Confessions Part III", a play on [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] by Usher. The song purports to be a continuation of the Usher songs [...] "Confessions" [...] and [...] "Confessions Part II", focusing on trivial, silly, strange, and disturbing confessions; Yankovic explained that, [...] "After hearing Usher do , I couldn’t help but think that maybe he’d left a few things out, that there were a few confessions he had yet to make." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the Russian {{recognition}} of South Ossetia, Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt stated, [...] "South Ossetian independence <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> We {{are talking about}} a smugglers' paradise of 60,000 people financed by the Russian security services.

Look what happened. Did you hear of any particular efforts of the United Nations UNIFIL force in the south of Lebanon to prevent the attacks against Israel in the first place. So they were not useful and that is why we were unhappy with them." ...|$|E
