50|$|For a cricket net, the netting is {{the most}} {{important}} component. The net is usually manufactured in a synthetic polymer such as polyethylene, this is a hard wearing and relatively economic material. Prior to the mid-1990s nets were often made from nylon, however after the significant spikes in crude oil prices it was no longer viable to use nylon. The net will be black in colour or occasionally green. The mesh size of the net will be 50mm and will commonly have a twine diameter ranging from 1.8mm - 3.0mm. Cricket nets are supplied from a knotless or <b>knotted</b> <b>netting</b> - {{as a rule of thumb}} <b>knotted</b> <b>nets</b> are considered to be superior. It is important to understand that twine thickness of <b>knotted</b> and knotless <b>nets</b> are not directly comparable as breaking strengths of <b>knotted</b> <b>nets</b> are higher than knotless. A good standard cricket net will be UV stabilised and rot proof. For people who construct their own cricket cage, the netting is the only component which they need to purchase from a specialist supplier. Cricket netting is seamed at the edges to stop netting fraying. These seams are usually a 6mm cord sewn into the netting where it meets a cage or end. Canvas blinkers can be added to offer privacy and to reduce net wear. Also partial canvas skirts of 0.5m (at the lower portion of the netting) are added to prevent animal damage at night from creatures walking into netting and chewing out of it.|$|R

50|$|Overall {{there is}} no need to protect or set aside {{conservation}} easements for the bigmouth buffalo, it seems to be a very well adapted species to its range and maintains its population well naturally. However it would be good to have a proper estimate on the abundance of species across its native range and monitored in order to catch any beginning of decline quickly to take action. Since the bigmouth is a foodfish it is easy to look at the commercial catching as a way to sample the population. It is shown that <b>knotted</b> <b>nets</b> can harm the fish causing hemorrhages and scale loss which would not be conducive to having little impact on the species while sampling. It would be ideal to seine for the bigmouth through oxbows and other regions of their range. This should be done in multiple locations in the Lake Erie, Ohio River, Mississippi River, Tennessee River, Milk River, Los Angeles aqueducts and Missouri River reservoirs where the fish are known to be caught. The species should be netted, sized, counted, and released. If the funding was available it would be good to tag the small ones for future population estimates.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the sight, sound, smell and touch of different cloth-types in the Late Ertebølle of southern Scandinavia and to argue that such an approach provides stimulating new insights into an area of material culture that has previously been studied by archaeologists in a highly empirical manner. The archaeological evidence drawn together in this paper points to this as a time when furs and skin products were of prime importance and plant fibres were the basis for <b>knotted</b> <b>nets,</b> looped cloth and basketry. In the archaeological literature these cloth-types are usually treated separately and described according to the species of raw materials, such as pine marten fur, or the technology of their production, such as couched button hole stitch. Using an experiment where participants are asked to handle modern cloth-types and answer structured questionnaires, it is possible to create a sensory description of these cloth-types. These descriptive results are then used to reconsider aspects of cloth and clothing in the Late Ertebølle of southern Scandinavia. By moving from the standard technological description to a sensory description, the Mesolithic cloth types investigated in this paper are placed within a sensory and phenomenological theoretical framework. The presentation of these results seeks to provide a new description of these materials and allow archaeologists to revaluate the culturally embedded nature of cloth and clothing at that time...|$|R

The equations of motion are formulated for the coupled dynamics of the masses and solved numerically. Drag data from the experiments is compared with analytical and numerical models and existing empirical formulae.

40|$|The PATENDER {{activity}} (Net parametric characterization and parabolic flight), {{funded by}} the European Space Agency (ESA) via its Clean Space initiative, was aiming to validate a simulation tool for designing nets for capturing space debris. This validation has been performed {{through a set of}} different experiments under microgravity conditions where a net was launched capturing and wrapping a satellite mock-up. This paper presents the architecture of the thrown-net dynamics simulator together with the set-up of the deployment experiment and its trajectory reconstruction results on a parabolic flight (Novespace A- 310, June 2015). The simulator has been implemented within the Blender framework in order to provide a highly configurable tool, able to reproduce different scenarios for Active Debris Removal missions. The experiment has been performed over thirty parabolas offering around 22 s of zero-g conditions. Flexible meshed fabric structure (the net) ejected from a container and propelled by corner masses (the bullets) arranged around its circumference have been launched at different initial velocities and launching angles using a pneumatic-based dedicated mechanism (representing the chaser satellite) against a target mock-up (the target satellite). High-speed motion cameras were recording the experiment allowing 3 D reconstruction of the net motion. The <b>net</b> <b>knots</b> have been coloured to allow the images post-process using colour segmentation, stereo matching and iterative closest point (ICP) for knots tracking.
