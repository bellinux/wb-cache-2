5000|$|Another {{compounding}} {{issue was}} the difference between accents of the four lead actors: Chow Yun-fat is from Hong Kong and speaks Cantonese natively, and Michelle Yeoh is from Malaysia and grew up speaking English and Malay; she learned the Mandarin lines phonetically. Only Zhang Ziyi spoke with a native Mandarin accent that Ang Lee wanted.

5000|$|But in late 1999 {{when young}} lead actor Hrithik Roshan arrived on {{location}} to start shooting Mission Kashmir, his first film {{had not yet}} released to theatres, so no one recognized his face. Arriving for the <b>first</b> <b>day's</b> <b>shoot</b> in Srinagar dressed as a Kashmiri militant, which he portrays in the film, the security guards on location thought Hrithik really WAS Kashmiri - because of his fair skin and light colouring - and refused to allow him on set!

After an enthusiastic response, their solo careers were put on hold, and the duo began uploading more videos, including their breakout hit [...] "Summertime Love." [...] Shortly after meeting, they started making music together in Myles' bedroom. Social media then sparked their popularity.
