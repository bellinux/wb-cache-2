A method to determine the energy emitted during a pick on rock strike has been found using the SIMTARS Friction Ignition Rig. A number of site samples have been used to simulate rock strikes as would occur with a continuous miner or longwall shearer contacting roof, floor, or dyke rock. Analysis of the three key indicators – hotspot size, temperature, and duration – allows the calculation of the amount of energy being emitted from the rock face. Due to the time-based nature of the rate of energy (heat) emission, a plot can be drawn from the data and used to rank <b>frictional</b> <b>ignition</b> potential between rock types and mine sites. Once comprehensive testing of a large sample of coal mine rocks has been completed, the mines that are at most risk of a <b>frictional</b> <b>ignition</b> can be advised as to how to best avoid such an occurrence.

40|$|A key {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to share application of chilled water sprays for prevention of frictional ignitions in coal mines to provide a safe occupational environment. Frictional ignitions in underground mines if not managed adequately may lead to major explosions. Historic statistics have indicated that the greatest explosion risk originates from frictional ignitions. Methane and dust related to explosions have resulted in over 7500 lives lost in the last ten years worldwide. The experiences of chilled water sprays used for managing heat in deep metal mines in South Africa is highly relevant to frictional incendive/face heat management in Australian coal mines. Mine ventilation and water sprays (used for dust suppression and dilution ventilation) are established technologies that are widely used in coal mines for the prevention of frictional ignitions. However, greater benefits of cooling or the sharp reduction in incendive heat from cutting picks by the use of chilled water sprays outweighs cooling using the current practice of using warm service water. Chilled water spray droplets have the potential to become „improved last line of defense‟ against gas ignitions. For example, introduction of chilled water sprays with millions of fine chilled water droplets around picks and face area would provide a simple, reliable and rapid cooling power of 210 kW and 1 005 kW for continuous miners faces and Longwall shearer face respectively. A US study has noted that 90 % of all frictional ignitions occurred in coal mines that liberated at least 0. 39 % of CH 4 through their mine ventilation air methane system.

Nevertheless, in very gassy coal seams, this methane released at the face can pose a problem because the shearer is a ready ignition source. Preventing methane ignitions at longwall faces requires four actions. The first is to provide better ventilation around the shearer to eliminate the ventilation eddy zones at the drums where methane builds up. These eddy zones are eliminated by mounting additional water sprays on the shearer to direct air into them. The second action to prevent methane ignitions is to install a water spray behind each cutter bit and regularly replace worn bits. Water sprays behind each cutter bit act to quench the hot metal streak that follows a worn bit when it strikes rock. The third {{is to ensure that}} no ventilation eddy zones are inadvertently created by poor placement of water sprays. The fourth is to ensure that the methane monitor on the shearer is in the best location to detect methane accumulations. ADDRESSING METHANE ACCUMULATIONS AT LONGWALL FACES 3 Cecala et al. [1985 a, 1989] and Denk and Wirth [1991] studied methane emission and ventilation patterns at longwall faces to find where methane accumulations are most likely. Although not always the case, the major source of methane at longwall faces is usually the breakage of coal by the shearer. Stress-related fracturing of the coal seam at the face, called bumps or bounces, can cause the release of additional gas (Figure 4 - 1) ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Frictional {{ignitions}} {{continue to}} be a problem facing the U. S. underground coal mining industry. Many methane ignitions are associated with the impact of mining machine cutter bits on quartzitic material (e. g., sandstone) during the coal-cutting process. Most ignitions result in small methane-air fireballs often only a few feet in size and limited to the cutter head location. However, under certain conditions, frictional ignitions can lead to larger methane explosions and/or fires with the potential for causing serious injury or death to the mining machine operator and other nearby miners. The requirements for a <b>frictional</b> <b>ignition</b> are a flammable volume of methane-air and an ignition source. This source is usually the hot streak caused by the frictional impact of the mining bit on hard rock, and the frequency of occurrence increases with increased bit wear. Another possible ignition source is the frictional impact of rock on rock during a roof fall. In addition to flammable methane gas, some underground coal mines encounter heavier molecular weight liquid hydrocarbons that can generate flammable vapors. For example, a coal mine in Utah experienced significant inflows of liquid hydrocarbons, with approximately 1, 200 gal being pumped from the mine per day. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) reported that this mine experienced several ignitions, including one in 1998 that led to a significant fire. MSHA listed liquid hydrocarbons as contributing to this fire [Elkins et al. 2001]. On July 31 -August 1, 2000, there were multiple explosions and a fire at the same mine, resulting in 2 fatalities and 12 injuries. The MSHA investigation report listed methane and liquid hydrocarbons as contributing to the explosions and fire [McKinney et al. 2001]. Approach: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Laboratory conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effect of added hydrocarbon liquids on the <b>frictional</b> <b>ignition</b> potential from the impact of mining bits on sandstone. The experiments were conducted in a laboratory test apparatus where a single miner bit on a cutter drum struck a sandstone block. The bit was worn so that the shank steel was exposed. A 100 -ft 3 mixture of flammable methane-air was enclosed by a plastic diaphragm that broke and vented the explosion after ignition. The relative ease of ignition was measured by the number of strikes necessary to cause ignition. Tests were conducted with flammable methane-air mixtures and with added liquid hydrocarbons on the sandstone block. The first series of tests was conducted to determine the number of strikes of the bit on the sandstone block necessary to ignite a flammable mixture of methane-air. With the cutter drum rotating, the sandstone block was moved horizontally in front of the cutter bit so {{that there would be a}} fresh surface for each strike of the bit. Additional tests were done with hydrocarbon liquid sprayed on the sandstone just before each test. Since hydrocarbon liquid samples No. 530 March 2008 from actual mines were not available for this study, a liquid hydrocarbon simulant was mixed based on the MSHA analyses of the hydrocarbons at the Utah mine [Elkins et al. 2001]. MSHA reported that "the hydrocarbons were tested and were determined to be chemically similar to a mixture of 15 % gasoline, 35 % diesel fuel, and 50 % motor oil" [Elkins et al. 2001]. Results: Using a worn bit, five tests were conducted with only methane-air in the test chamber. The mixture did not ignite in any of the five tests, with an average of greater than 90 strikes per test. An additional five tests were conducted with added liquid hydrocarbon simulant on the sandstone. The methane-air mixture ignited in each of these five tests, with an average of about 30 strikes to ignition. The explanation may be that the liquid hydrocarbon ignites more easily than methane, and then it forms a pilot flame that ignites the methane. The hydrocarbon vapors can ignite at significantly lower temperatures than the methane. Based on these results, NIOSH researchers determined that the presence of a hydrocarbon liquid in the mining environment has the potential to increase the ignition hazard associated with the frictional heating from impact of steel on sandstone. Recommendations: Improving the ventilation airflow should be the main method for reducing any flammable gas volume, thereby limiting the extent of flame propagation if a <b>frictional</b> <b>ignition</b> should occur. The <b>frictional</b> <b>ignition</b> probability decreases with new sharp bits. Replacing worn bits on a regular basis and using adequate back-mounted water sprays (that cool the frictional hot spots) have been shown to reduce the <b>frictional</b> <b>ignition</b> probability of methane when used on longwall and continuous mining machines. The increased fire and explosion hazard associated with the presence of heavy hydrocarbons can be estimated by collecting and measuring the flash point of the fresh hydrocarbon liquid. If the flash point is at or below the ambient mine temperature, the liquid can ignite and burn even without methane. If the flash point is above ambient temperature, the liquid hydrocarbon can enhance the ignition probability of methane. When using a handheld methanometer in the presence of heavier hydrocarbons, the instrument needs to be calibrated with gas mixtures that reflect the presence of the heavier hydrocarbon vapors. The instrument manufacturer should be contacted for advice on calibration procedures that will ensure accurate measurement of potentially flammable mixtures. In summary, extra precautions to prevent fires and explosions must be taken when heavier molecular weight liquid hydrocarbons are present in addition to methane in an underground coal mine.

A high value of 4. 1 (exp 8) watts per square meter for Inconel MA 754 is used to imply resistance to friction ignition, whereas a low value of 1. 04 (exp 8) watts per square meter for stainless steel 304 is taken as indicating material susceptible to friction ignition. No attempt has been made to relate PV values to other material properties.

40|$|Frictional {{ignitions}} {{are defined}} as the ignition of a flammable mixture of methane and air that is initiated by frictional heating. Ignitions created through the addition of energy from open flames and exposed electrical circuits {{are not included in}} this analysis. Energy released in a roof fall that creates a spark and ignites a methane mixture would be considered a <b>frictional</b> <b>ignition.</b> Frictional ignitions represent the majority of all ignitions in underground coal mines. Over the study period of 1983 to 2005, a total of 1993 ignitions were reported in underground bituminous coal mines in the United States, of which 1589 were frictional ignitions. Reportable ignitions to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) are any unintentional occurrences of flame underground regardless of duration. Frictional ignitions were reported in 155 mines and 13 states. Continuous miners represented the largest source for frictional ignitions with 1090 (68. 6 % of all frictional ignitions). Longwall mining operations represented the highest concentration of frictional ignitions during this study period with 1365 frictional ignitions (85. 9 % of all frictional ignitions). The 17 mines with the most frictional ignitions were all longwall mining operations and had 1130 frictional ignitions (307 from the shearer) that represented 71. 1 % of the total. In 1983, mines with frictional ignitions represented 6. 9 % of operating underground mines and 36. 6 % of total underground coal production. The percentage of operating underground mines with frictional ignitions and their total production has increased steadily and in 2005 represented 9. 8 % of active mines and 46. 2 % of underground coal production. The three coalbeds with the highest number of frictional ignitions (Blue Creek, Pittsburgh No 8, and Pocahontas No 3) had 1049 ignitions that represented 66. 0 % of all frictional ignitions. The three states with the highest number of frictional ignitions were Alabama (710), Virginia (247), and Pennsylvania (242) that represented 75. 5 % of the total. Frictional ignitions peaked in 1991 with a high of 114. In 2005, only 34 frictional ignitions were reported. If only frictional ignitions that occur at the face are considered, there have been no fatalities since 1983. Since this time, there were 33 ignitions that caused 53 workers to lose a total of 2912 working days. When including ground falls, then there have been four frictional ignitions with one incident causing two fatalities and injuring eight workers. From 1983 - 1991, underground productivity and the number of frictional ignitions increased. However, productivity continued to increase from 1991 - 2000 while total frictional ignitions fell, thereby disproving this connection between productivity and frequency of frictional ignitions. Ninety percent of all frictional ignitions occurred in underground coal mines that liberated more than 393 L/s (1. 2 MMcfd million cubic feet per day) of methane through the main ventilation system. Although methane production is not the determining factor for the occurrence of frictional ignitions, it is a good indicator of the anticipated frequency...|$|E
