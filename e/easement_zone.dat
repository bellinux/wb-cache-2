5000|$|Interstate 10 {{was built}} in 1982 {{throughout}} Mississippi. Interstate 10 was originally completed in Alabama and Louisiana before Mississippi completed its portion. I-10 in Alabama routed onto U.S. Route 90 at the state line, which was the default roadway across southern Mississippi before I-10 was completed. Today, US-90 is not directly accessible from the I-10. When coming from Louisiana, I-10 ended at Mississippi Highway 607 (Exit 2). Today, entering Mississippi from Louisiana, the first twelve miles is the NASA John C. Stennis Space Center <b>easement</b> <b>zone.</b> To this day, I-10 displays the control city of Bay St. Louis from New Orleans, Louisiana and Pascagoula from traveling from Mobile, Alabama.|$|E
5000|$|A {{buffer zone}} is {{generally}} a [...] area that lies between {{two or more}} other areas (often, but not necessarily, countries), but {{depending on the type}} of buffer zone, the reason for it may be to segregate regions or to conjoin them.Common types of buffer zones are demilitarized zones, border zones and certain restrictive <b>easement</b> <b>zones</b> and green belts.

It deals mainly with <b>easements,</b> protective <b>zones,</b> and other public rights to property. This public nature {{is due to the}} fact that these rights are established by the law and in the public interest. The aim of this diploma thesis is to evaluate the current and antecedent legislation of the issue of rights to foreign property in connection with the construction of the energy network infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|The {{continued}} existence vernal pools and other sensitive environmental areas greatly depends upon {{local and state}} land use decisions. Practices such as Euclidian Zoning, where land uses are separated into different districts, usually fail {{to account for the}} protection of these sensitive areas. However, local governments in New York, using implied municipal power created by state legislation, have a variety of land use tools to help alleviate the destruction of environmentally sensitive areas. These tools include: overlay zoning, incentive zoning, conservation <b>easements,</b> floating <b>zones,</b> and transferring development rights. By using these tools within a well-integrated strategy, New York communities can effectively preserve these areas better than the Euclidian Zoning schemes of the past...|$|R
