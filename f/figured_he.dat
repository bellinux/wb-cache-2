Oakley and Weinstein were unfamiliar with Puente and wrote him into the episode because Groening is a fan.

His band would also play their version of The Simpsons theme over the end credits.|$|E

Invited to Dylan's Woodstock {{home for the}} weekend to learn new material, Bloomfield recalled, [...] "The first thing I heard was 'Like a Rolling Stone'.

500|$|Collier was {{assigned}} to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station north of Chicago, where he was a survival swimming instructor. It was in the Navy that Collier first had trouble with his hearing, a problem that dogged him later in life. He was once called to report to his ship over a loudspeaker but did not hear it. Doctors thought his hearing may have been damaged by teaching swimming in a tidal pool or from practicing on the shooting range. [...] "It never became an issue until the Navy, when they <b>figured</b> <b>he</b> had less than 40% of a normal person's hearing," [...] his daughter Kay Collier-Slone said in 1997. To compensate for his hearing loss, Collier became an expert lip-reader.|$|E
500|$|The {{news of the}} {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln on 15 April, 1865 caused demonstrations of sorrow in Sydney. An editorial in Melbourne's [...] "The Age" [...] newspaper on June 27, 1865 reported that in Sydney {{the assassination}} of Lincoln had caused great indignation. There were many Australian sympathisers that wanted {{to put an end}} to slavery, a central issue with Lincoln and his Emancipation Proclamation. A memorial service was held in Sydney's Prince of Wales Opera House on Sunday afternoon July 9, 1865. There were strong feelings of anger at public meetings against the killer of Lincoln, a person so dedicated to his country. They <b>figured</b> <b>he</b> was a genius who rose [...] "from a log cabin to the White House." ...|$|E
500|$|Grohl's first musical {{performance}} following {{the demise of}} Nirvana was performing with The Backbeat Band at the 1994 MTV Movie Awards in June, during which he was invited by Mike Watt {{to take part in}} his album Ball-Hog or Tugboat?. After enjoying the performance, Grohl <b>figured</b> <b>he</b> could do his own musical project, which could work as [...] "some sort of cathartic therapy, to go out and record these songs that I'd written by myself." [...] Grohl afterwards booked six days at Seattle's Robert Lang Studios, which were located near his house, where he would record [...] "my favorite songs I had written in the past four, five years that no one had heard" [...] with the assistance of producer Barrett Jones, with whom he had recorded the demo tape Pocketwatch in 1992. The idea was to have Grohl playing all instruments and release it under a name that would make people believe it was a band, similar to Stewart Copeland's Klark Kent.|$|E

McCartney {{is alleged to have}} performed a similar role over thirty years earlier, chewing celery to form the percussion track of The Beach Boys song [...] "Vegetables" [...] from the album Smiley Smile. The Super Furry Animals had met the ex-Beatle at the NME Awards when a drunk Ciaran persuaded him to let them remix some Beatles material, resulting in 2000's Liverpool Sound Collage album. The band asked him to [...] "return the favour" [...] and appear on Rings Around the World, recording his part over the phone. Huw Bunford has said of McCartney's contribution: [...] "He took it with good nature. You kind of see how far you can go sometimes ... we figured we already had a bass and singers so we really didn't need any more musicians. So we <b>figured</b> <b>he</b> could crunch vegetables". [...] Former Velvet Underground member John Cale, a [...] "sort of childhood hero" [...] of Rhys's, also makes an appearance on the album, playing piano on the song [...] "Presidential Suite". The Super Furry Animals had met Cale in Cardiff when they acted as his backing band for a song which appeared on the film Beautiful Mistake. They originally asked him to arrange strings for [...] "Presidential Suite" [...] but Cale turned them down reasoning that he would simply do what the band do: hum a melody to someone who could write the music down for him.|$|E

2500|$|Kramer wrote, however, that [...] "Billie Jean {{beat him}} fair and square. A lot of men—especially around our age—were so stunned {{when he lost}} that they <b>figured</b> <b>he</b> must have tanked. Budge is {{convinced}} of that. But what motive would Riggs have for that? Bobby Riggs, the biggest ham in the world, gets his greatest audience—and purposefully looks bad? There's no way. If he had beaten Billie Jean, he could have kept the act going indefinitely.

[...] Selena Roberts claimed in her book documenting the match, A Necessary Spectacle, that Riggs later undertook a public polygraph test to prove he did not throw the match.|$|E

He had also left his self-rescue poles back at , knowing he was past the worst crevasse fields. Most people <b>figured</b> <b>he</b> had fallen on his descent of the headwall and been hurt, died, and was buried by snow. Another theory is that he could have made it to [...] (which is the base of the headwall) and then fallen into one of the many crevasses there and perished.|$|E

As he lay dying, Holliday is reported to have asked the nurse attending him for a shot of whiskey. When she told him no, he looked at his bootless feet, amused. The nurses said that his last words were, [...] "This is funny." [...] He always <b>figured</b> <b>he</b> would be killed someday with his boots on. Holliday died at 10am on November 8, 1887.

2500|$|Glen [...] "Big Baby" [...] Davis {{had just}} left Louisiana State University's (LSU) {{basketball}} team as well as seven-foot center Magnum Rolle, who transferred to Louisiana Tech, leaving the team with only two bigs, one being a junior college transfer. Due to this fact, LSU told Randolph that if he joined their team, he could possibly play right away as a freshman. Washington said that Baylor, Georgetown, Kansas, Memphis, and Texas were also interested in recruiting Randolph. Though Memphis was Randolph's early choice in the recruitment process, he wanted to attend a school where he could play big minutes, which he <b>figured</b> <b>he</b> probably would not get to do at Memphis since the team's roster was so deep at the time. Randolph made an impact in college right away, as he had six blocks in just his third game during his freshman season. During his lone season at LSU, Randolph earned Honorable Mention All-SEC and First Team All-Freshman Team honors. Randolph was the only LSU Tiger to start all thirty-one games in his freshman season, and averaged 15.6 points, 8.5 rebounds, 1.2 assists, 1.13 steals, and 2.26 blocks per contest. Although the team only ended {{the season with a}} 13-18 record, Randolph finished strong by averaging 20.1 points during the last nine games of the year. Randolph also ranked third in the Southeastern Conference in rebounding and blocked shots, twelfth in scoring, and posted nine double-doubles his freshman season.|$|E
