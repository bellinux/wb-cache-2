5000|$|His {{work on the}} {{ideology}} and social evolution of transnational terrorism, which has included fieldwork with mujahedin and supporters in Europe, the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, and North Africa, has challenged common assumptions. Cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker summarizes some of Atran's findings thus: [...] Far from being ignorant, impoverished, nihilistic, or mentally ill, suicide terrorists tend to be educated, middle class, morally engaged, and free of obvious psychopathology. Atran concluded {{that many of the}} motives may be found in nepotistic altruism... shows that Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups hold out a carrot rather than a stick to the terrorist's family in the form of generous monthly stipends, lump-sum payments, and massive prestige in the community.... Atran has also found that suicide terrorists can be recruited without these direct incentives. Probably the most <b>effective</b> <b>call</b> to martyrdom is the opportunity to join a happy band of brothers. Terrorist cells often begin as gangs of underemployed single young men who come together in cafes, dorms, soccer clubs, barbershops, or Internet chat rooms and suddenly find meaning in their lives by a commitment to the new platoon.... Commitment to the group is intensified by religion, not just the literal promise of paradise but the feeling of spiritual awe that comes from submerging oneself in a crusade, a calling, a vision quest, or a jihad. writes that religion may also turn a commitment to a cause into a sacred value — a good that may not be traded off against something else, including life itself. The commitment can be further stoked by the thirst for revenge, which in the case of militant Islamism takes the form of vengeance for the harm and humiliation suffered by any Muslim anywhere on the planet at any time in history, or for symbolic affronts such as the presence of infidel soldiers on sacred Muslim soil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In a {{personal}} communication service (PCS) network, the call completion probability and the <b>effective</b> <b>call</b> holding times for both complete and incomplete calls are central parameters {{in the network}} cost/performance evaluation. These quantities {{will depend on the}} distributions of call holding times and cell residence times. The classical assumptions made in the past that call holding times and cell residence times are exponentially distributed are not appropriate for the emerging PCS networks. This paper presents some systematic results on the probability of call completion and the <b>effective</b> <b>call</b> holding time distributions for complete and incomplete calls with general cell residence times and call holding times distributed with various distributions such as Gamma, Erlang, hyperexponential, hyper-Erlang, and other staged distributions. These results provide a set of alternatives for PCS network modeling, which can be chosen to accommodate the measured data from PCS field trials. The application of these results in billing rate planning is also discussed. Index Terms—Billing rate planning, call blocking, call holding time, call termination, cell residence, handoff, PCS.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} linguistic {{issues that}} one must address in order to design an <b>effective</b> <b>CALL</b> system for second language learners. We focus on how one should develop an error taxonomy and indicate how that taxonomy can affect {{the design of the}} entire system. This work was done in the context of designing a CALL tool to help native signers of American Sign Language (ASL) learn written English. Here we report the methodology used in developing the error taxonomy for the system. Our analysis of writing samples from ASL natives indicates that language transfer (LT) (when considered appropriately) can account for many of the errors we found. Recognizing this possibility has substantially in uenced the error taxonomy we have developed. The resulting taxonomy captures the true source of many errors and will allow the eventual system to take advantage of ASL knowledge when teaching English. We provide a characterization of language transfer that provides a broad perspective on the ways that two languages may differ and indicates how these differences could potentially influence acquisition and production of the second language. In addition, we argue that an <b>effective</b> <b>CALL</b> system must not only examine sentences in isolation, but it must identify and correct discourse-level errors.

Given {{the parameters of the}} MAC protocol and voice codecs, the voice capacity of an infrastructure-based WLAN, in terms of the maximum number of voice connections that can be supported with satisfactory user-perceived quality, is obtained. In addition, voice capacity analysis reveals how the overheads from different layers, codec rate, and voice packetization interval affect voice traffic performance in WLANs, which provides an important guideline for network planning and management.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} to QoS (Quality of Service) routing in a multimedia, multihop, wireless network.

The main focus of {{the paper is the}} QoS routing procedure which can inform the source of the bandwidth and quality of service available to any destination in the wireless network. This knowledge enables the establishment of QoS connections within the wireless network and the efficient support of real time, multimedia traffic. In addition, it enables more <b>effective</b> <b>call</b> acceptance control. In the case of ATM interconnection, QoS information permits to extend the ATM virtual circuit service to the wireless network, with possible renegotiation of QoS parameters at the gateway.
