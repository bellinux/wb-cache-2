5|$|Alucard {{appears in}} , {{a chapter of}} the Lords of Shadow reboot series. It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son, or telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to <b>finish</b> <b>what</b> he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1930s, Moses {{oversaw the}} {{conversion}} of a vast Queens tidal marsh garbage dump into the fairgrounds that hosted the 1939/1940 World's Fair. Called Flushing Meadows Park, it was Moses' grandest park scheme. He envisioned this vast park, comprising some 1,300acres(5km2) of land, easily accessible from Manhattan, as a major recreational playground for New Yorkers. When the 1939/1940 World's Fair ended in financial failure, Moses {{did not have the}} available funds to complete work on his project.

He did not die attempting the ordeal, but was actually killed by a whaling ship crashing into his boat while {{he was trying to}} save humpback whales.

25|$|The {{construction}} of Boldt Castle ceased abruptly in early 1904 {{after the death}} of Boldt's wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt. Boldt never returned to Heart Island, leaving this structure as a monument of his love. For 73 years, the castle and other stone structures were left exposed to the harsh winter weather and occasional vandals. The Thousand Islands Bridge Authority acquired Heart Island and the nearby yacht house in 1977, for one dollar, under the agreement that all revenues obtained from the castle operation would be applied towards restoration, so that the island would be preserved for the enjoyment of future generations. In the two decades after acquiring the property, the Thousand Islands Bridge Authority spent some $15 million for restoration and improvements here, and work continues annually. The initial goal of the restoration of Heart Island was not to <b>finish</b> <b>what</b> had not been completed, but to restore the island to the state it was in when construction was halted. Improvements have gone beyond that stage, however; a stained glass dome, marble floor, and grand staircase woodwork, for instance, now seen in the main hall, were not original but are modern innovations.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of the 13th century was a period of {{consolidation}} for both Scottish and Norwegian kings. The Norwegians, under Haakon, overcame a period of internal strife, from 1161 to 1208, and oversaw the submission of the Faroe Islands, the Greenland settlements, and Iceland, in the mid 13th century. The Scots, under Alexander II, King of Scots (d. 1249), extended royal authority into the northern Highlands, Argyll, and Galloway. The king also had wanted to incorporate the western seaboard into the Scottish realm. In 1230, Scottish aggression against the Isles and interference forced the Norwegian king to pacify the region. In 1249, after attempting to purchase the Isles from Haakon, Alexander II launched a campaign of his own, deep into Argyll and into the Hebrides. Unfortunately for the Scots, their king died suddenly on the verge of conquest. Since his son and successor, Alexander III (d. 1286), was only a boy at the time, the Scottish realm suffered through a lengthy and troubled minority. In consequence, it wasn't until the 1260s that the king looked west, and attempted to <b>finish</b> <b>what</b> his father had so nearly accomplished.|$|E
500|$|Fears were {{as high as}} ever {{among the}} traumatised fire victims, fear of foreign arsonists and of a French and Dutch invasion.

Surging into the streets, the frightened mob fell on any foreigners whom they happened to encounter, and were only appeased, according to Evelyn, [...] "with infinite pains and great difficulty" [...] and pushed back into the fields by the Trained Bands, troops of Life Guards, {{and members of the}} court.|$|E

500|$|... "Million Dollar Maybe" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'B' grade, {{the highest of}} the night. VanDerWerff was polarized with the plot, opining that it was convoluted and stated, [...] "This was a completely stupid plot, but to the show's credit, it commented on this when Homer told Marge he won the lottery and she said she'd much rather have the money than the wedding reception performance he missed." [...] Similarly, VanDerWerff was split with the subplot of [...] "Million Dollar Maybe". In regards to the subplot, he wrote, [...] "The Lisa gets the old people a Wii stand-in plot {{was one of those}} ones where the Simpsons writers have obviously noticed something in pop culture but have yet to wholly grasp what it is or why it's important." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8.1 out of 10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. Canning felt that the episode was impressive, expressing that it was [...] "a fun and funny episode focused on Homer and his always dysfunctional relationship with his family [...] just what we've come to love and expect after 20 years." [...] Jason Hughes of [...] TV Squad gave the episode a more mixed review, praising the episode's humor, but calling it [...] "random". Hughes wrote, [...] "A lot about this episode bothered me, and I think The Simpsons has been having a pretty strong season for the most part." [...] He resumed, [...] "This one just didn't hold together as strongly as most of the prior ones." [...] He went on to criticize the character development of Ricardo, opining that it was a [...] "slap to the face to the winner." [...] He then commented: [...] "Peggy Black created Ricardo Bomba as a new ladies man type of figure, so the writers had him drive into a cliff wall and subsequent fiery explosion right away upon his first appearance. He didn't even get to <b>finish</b> <b>what</b> was, I guess, going to be his catchphrase." ...|$|E

They ordered him to Kursk in order to take up his command, leaving his Corps behind, and Sevastopol air operations under the command of von Wild. Richthofen was disgusted. He felt it was ridiculous to move him mid-operation, and he had wanted to be there when the fortress fell.
