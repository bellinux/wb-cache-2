40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impacts}} of water and environmental laws on <b>informal</b> <b>irrigation</b> farming in Zimbabwe and Tanzania. It explores how legal frameworks in Zimbabwe and Tanzania have for years hindered the development of community-based management of water for <b>informal</b> <b>irrigation</b> purposes. This is illustrated in the article by {{a detailed analysis of}} water and the environmental legislations of Zimbabwe and Tanzania. The actor-oriented approach theoretical framework guides the analysis of the data presented in this article. The case studies of Zimbabwe and Tanzania serve to illustrate that legislation in the Southern African region has yet to reach a point where it promotes sound community-based management of water for <b>informal</b> <b>irrigation</b> farming. It is also not clear how new water acts, such as the one introduced in Zimbabwe in 1998, will promote community-based management of water among informal irrigators. Given this scenario of legislation that does not promote community based management of water by informal irrigators, the participants in this economic activity have resorted to ignoring legal provisions and have, in most cases, developed their own local rules and regulations that govern management of water resources in their localities. This article contends that it is time governments in Southern Africa accepted <b>informal</b> <b>irrigation</b> and enacted laws that encourage the sustainable management of water by the local communities.

40|$|In the Uluguru Mountains of Tanzania, an {{expansion}} in <b>informal</b> hosepipe <b>irrigation</b> by small-scale farmers has enabled {{the development of}} horticulture and resulted in improvements in farmers’ livelihoods. This has taken place largely independently of external support and {{can be seen as}} an example of the ‘private’ irrigation that is increasingly viewed as important for sub-Saharan Africa. However, these activities are seen by both representatives of government and some donors, as the cause of both environmental degradation and water shortages downstream, especially in the nearby city of Morogoro. As a result, there have been attempts to evict the farmers from the mountain. Negative narratives persist and the farmers on the mountainside are portrayed as a problem to be ‘solved’. This article explores these tensions, contributing to debates about the formalisation of water management arrangements and the place of the state in regulating and adjudicating rights to access water. We argue that a focus on legality and formalisation serves to obscure the political nature of competing claims on resources that the case illustrates...|$|R

40|$|South Asia {{in general}} and India in {{particular}} is heavily dependent on groundwater for supporting its largely agrarian population. <b>Informal</b> pump <b>irrigation</b> services markets have {{played an important role}} in providing access to irrigation to millions of small and marginal farmers and had positive equity, efficiency and sustainable impacts in water-abundant regions such as West Bengal. Quite predictably, in such pump lift-based economy, fortunes of energy and irrigation sectors are closely entwined. This has often been called the 'energy-irrigation' nexus. There are two major sources of energy for pumping groundwater, viz. electricity and diesel. Most of the current discourse in the field has looked only at the 'electricity-irrigation' nexus to the exclusion of the 'diesel-irrigation nexus'. This paper looks at both these aspects. In doing so, it makes two propositions. First, high flat-rate electricity tariff encourages development of water markets whereby the water buyers?who are mostly small and marginal farmers?benefit through access to irrigation. Second, low rate of rural electrification has forced majority of farmers to depend on diesel for groundwater pumping and the steep increase in diesel prices over the last few years has resulted in economic scarcity of groundwater. This in turn has had serious negative impacts on crop production and farm incomes. Using primary field data from West Bengal, India, this paper makes a case for rapid rural electrification and continuation of high flat-rate tariff, which would in turn support developed groundwater markets and provide access to irrigation to the poor and marginal farmers...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at 3 rd Marcelino Botin Foundation Water Workshop, Santander, Spain, 12 - 14 June 2007 This paper deals with three different, yet related issues of groundwater use, viz. economics, ethics and politics. One {{of the most}} important ethical dilemmas of global groundwater use is that its positive impact on food security, incomes of the poor and poverty alleviation are relatively under-estimated while the negative externalities are often over-emphasized. The first section of this paper deals with this very ethical dilemma by illustrating how the role of groundwater irrigation in sustaining high agricultural growth rates in West Bengal [...] an eastern state of India, has been completely over looked in academic discussions so far. Groundwater irrigation has conferred immense economic benefits in terms of increased access to irrigation, higher cropping intensity and productivity. <b>Informal</b> groundwater based <b>irrigation</b> services markets have {{played an important role in}} this regard. The second section, based on primary data collected from 580 respondents in 40 villages in the state, specially focuses on groundwater economics and the impact of groundwater supported private irrigation services markets. The third section of the paper concentrates on groundwater politics. It shows that the dominant discourse in the field of groundwater studies in India has been that of depletion and scarcity so much so that the groundwater policies even in a well-endowed state such as West Bengal has been unduly influenced by this dominant discourse. The result has been that of a paradox: little groundwater regulation where resource conditions are precarious (e. g. Gujarat, Tamil Nadu) and strict regulation where little is needed (e. g. West Bengal) ...|$|R
40|$|In Pakistan, where {{agriculture}} is {{heavily dependent on}} <b>irrigation,</b> <b>informal</b> water markets are an increasingly important way to provide small farmers and tenant farmers with access to ground- water. The public canal irrigation system provides water to farmers who own land within designated areas, {{but it does not}} provide all farmers with adequate water supplies when they need it. Therefore, farmers who can afford it are installing tubewells as a sole or supplementary source of irrigation (Figure 1). Despite the growth in private tubewells, ownership remains limited to a relatively small percentage of farmers. Some well owners also sell groundwater to other nearby farmers. The resulting localized, informal markets have become an important source of irrigation for many farmers. Although selling water from private wells is a long-standing practice in South Asia, these informal arrangements are only now being examined in detail. As water becomes scarce or degraded, more information is needed to help Pakistan and other South Asian countries make policy decisions that will improve equity of access to groundwater resources. Groundwater Markets in Pakistan: Participation and Productivity, Research Report 105, by Ruth Meinzen-Dick, looks at how water markets operate, who participates, the nature of the transactions, and the effects of the markets on agricultural productivity and incomes, in order to determine what helps or hinders the emergence of viable water markets. The report reviews the current literature on groundwater markets, the empirical evidence on performance, and the available policy options. The study examines patterns of private tubewell and groundwater market development using district-level data for the country as a whole, then looks in detail at the performance of groundwater markets using farm household data collected in an IFPRI survey conducted in 1990 - 92.

40|$|A {{research}} paper on farmer - initiated irrigation furrows by Zimbabwe's smallholder rural farmers. Important for the contemporary debate {{in relation to}} irrigation development in Zimbabwe is the realisation that during colonial times and after independence, <b>informal</b> <b>irrigation</b> furrows were constructed and operated by smallholder farmers. This is in spite of active discouragement by government apparatus for {{the greater part of}} this century. This chapter provides some evidence of the worth and spread of ‘informal’ irrigation furrows in the Eastern Highlands. Such furrows should be recognised for their important productive capacities, and for the pool of managerial experience to which they give rise. We argue here that a lot can be learnt by a close examination of these furrows. The preliminary findings presented in this chapter, though limited to the Eastern Highlands, hint at their potential, and have relevance for the impending changes of the Water Act, the de-centralisation of the water sector embodied in the new Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA), and for the turning over of financial and water management responsibilities in government- initiated schemes to farmers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{study area}} was {{selected}} in El Saf District of El Giza Governorate in Egypt, covering 21461. 4 ha of Nile sediments and their outskirts of alluvial higher and lower terraces. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the impact of <b>informal</b> <b>irrigation</b> practices on drainage deterioration, soil pollution and land suitability for agricultural use using the satellite LDCM data 2013. From the lower alluvial terraces (partly cultivated using wastewater), the drainage flows westward via descending slopes resulting in land deterioration in both the alluvial lower terraces and alluvial plain of River Nile. The drainage conditions are excessively drained soils in the alluvial upper terraces within soils of Typic Haplocalcids, sandy skeletal, but in the lower terraces it partly occurred within soils of Typic Torriorthents, sandy skeletal. Moderately well drained soils occurred in soils of Typic Torriorthents, sandy in the alluvial lower terraces, while in the alluvial plain of Nile sediments are Sodic Haplotorrerts, fine. Poorly drained soils in the lower alluvial terraces have soils of Typic Epiaquents, sandy associated with Sodic Psammaquents and Aquic Haplocalcids, coarse loamy, while in the alluvial plain of River Nile the soils are Halic Epiaquerts, fine. Very poorly drained soils (submerged areas) are scattered spots in both the lower alluvial terraces and the alluvial plain. In the alluvial plain of River Nile, 1967. 1 ha become not suitable for the traditional cultivated crops, while in the alluvial terraces 3251. 0 ha are not suitable for the proposed cultivation of Jojoba plants. Heavy metals of Cadmium (Cd), Cobalt (Co), Lead (Pb) and Nickel (Ni) were added to the soil surface and sub-surface in the irrigated areas by wastewater in the lower alluvial terraces (moderately well drained soils), but Cd and Co exceeded the standards of permissible total concentrations in these soils. The same metals were added to soil sub-surface layers in the alluvial plain (poorly drained soils), but Co exceeded the total permissible concentrations. Continuing these <b>informal</b> <b>irrigation</b> practices, drainage condition will be deteriorated in extra areas and all heavy metal concentrations will exceed the standards of permissible levels. Improving the land qualities of drainage is required and Jojoba cultivation is proposed to replace the edible crop cultivation in the alluvial terraces to avoid the heavy metal contamination risk and to be used for developing a bio-fuel crop production of renewable energy...|$|E

40|$|<b>Informal</b> <b>irrigation</b> is {{receiving}} increasing attention in West Africa. In particular, irrigated urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) is thriving with significant benefits for farmers {{and the urban}} populations, though it is often handicapped by water pollution which threatens public health and prevents authorities from appreciating its advantages. To integrate UPA in sustainable urban development, a multi-stakeholder (MS) process has been implemented since 2005 in a stepwise approach in six West African cities. Accra, Ghana, was the first Anglophone city where the MS process tried to facilitate strategic partnerships for an improved research-policy dialogue. The process was supported by capacity building of local stakeholders, e. g. in participatory processes management, action planning and research, and monitoring and evaluation. These activities facilitated the official recognition of the role and benefits of UPA in Ghana in various ways. An internal lesson learnt was {{that there are many}} reasons why local partners might not give every project the expected priority and that related capacity-building efforts might consequently not provide the expected incentive for partner commitment. Moreover, flexibility is required to link research, capacity building and policy dialogue through an MS process as its dynamic can vary from city to city and thus cannot follow set theoretical standards...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{lays the}} {{foundation}} for the use of scenario modelling as a tool for integrated water resource management in the Okavango River basin. The Pitman hydrological model is used {{to assess the impact of}} various development and climate change scenarios on downstream river flow. The simulated impact on modelled river discharge of increased water use for domestic use, livestock, and <b>informal</b> <b>irrigation</b> (proportional to expected population increase) is very limited. Implementation of all likely potential formal irrigation schemes mentioned in available reports is expected to decrease the annual flow by 2 % and the minimum monthly flow by 5 %. The maximum possible impact of irrigation on annual average flow is estimated as 8 %, with a reduction of minimum monthly flow by 17 %. Deforestation of all areas within a 1 km buffer around the rivers is estimated to increase the flow by 6 %. However, construction of all potential hydropower reservoirs in the basin may change the monthly mean flow distribution dramatically, although under the assumed operational rules, the impact of the dams is only substantial during wet years. The simulated impacts of climate change are considerable larger that those of the development scenarios (with exception of the high development scenario of hydropower schemes) although the results are sensitive to the choice of GCM and the IPCC SRES greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios. The annual mean water flow predictions for the period 2020 – 2050 averaged over scenarios from all the four GCMs used in this study are close to the present situation for both the A 2 and B 2 GH...|$|E
40|$|Water, as a fluid {{resource}} is inherently a ‘fugitive resource’. Its sustainable and effective management {{has been a}} challenging one over the decades since it has constantly eluded a linear or a straightforward management regime. Various {{attempts have been made}} to design institutions for its effective governance but this is still inconclusive. This dissertation focuses on the analysis of the institutions that govern water and attempt to understand how water is managed within the Vea irrigation scheme in Ghana. The impact of irrigation on farmers’ incomes was further assessed. Qualitative methods, particularly interviews and focus group discussions were employed to achieve the objectives. Irrigators and irrigation management officials within the scheme formed the research participants. The theoretical foundations of this work is mainstream institutionalism led by Elinor Ostrom and critical institutionalism led by Frances Cleaver. This research produced a number of interesting key findings. In the first place the research found that different stakeholders had ownership of land depending on the season. The research found that the boundary of the resource and the community of users was fluid and kept changing depending on factors such as canal integrity, the season, rainfall amount and distribution. Farmers operated largely with informal rules. Traditional invisible institutions played a key role in the management of the irrigation scheme. Though farmers operated with rules, these rules were not deliberately crafted and written down. Farmers utilised informal conflict resolution mechanisms to resolve conflicts instead of the formal court system. The sanctioning regimes in place were effective but not fair. Contrary to popular literature that irrigators downstream are disadvantaged this study found that farmers who were located at the tail end and largely practiced pump farming were better positioned and performed better than formal irrigators upstream who performed canal irrigation. The research further found that the formal and <b>informal</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems existed and operated together under the same official management, an innovation that shows that the informal sector is amenable to formal governance. The research further indicated that irrigation had a positive impact on the incomes of farmers as irrigation provided the incomes for investing in alternative income generation ventures and putting up physical infrastructure such as accommodation. The research argues that in establishing irrigation schemes and irrigation management systems the informal institutions should not be overlooked since their inclusion will go a long way to reduce conflicts within the system...|$|E
40|$|Historically, Malawi has {{depended}} on rain-fed agricultural systems. It is {{reported that the}} frequent droughts and unreliable rainfall since early 1990 s have caused many small-scale farmers {{to turn to the}} wetlands as alternative sites for crop production. There they use low-cost farming methods and various forms of ‘informal’ irrigation. This study, to better understand the water management practices and the socioeconomic characteristics of the wetland farmers, was carried out in the Shire Valley, at the southern tip of Malawi. This covers about 600, 000 ha and supports around 250, 000 farming families. More than half is wetland, characterized by a network of small streams, rivers, and swamps, and a mosaic of many very small farms separated by bush. Phase I mainly documented the agriculture technologies and socioeconomic characteristics of wetland farming and small-scale <b>informal</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems. 200 farmers and other key informants were interviewed. Phase II aimed to define and measure the benefits of the current systems. The major farming systems groups were identified using cluster analysis and focus group discussions were carried out with 7 to 10 members of each. The results were assessed using gross margin analysis. The results show that flood recession agriculture, river diversion and treadle pumps were the commonest water management technologies among the farmers interviewed. Most preferred flood recession and river diversion to treadle pump, citing capital requirements and running costs as major obstacles. However, the government and NGOs were promoting treadle pump technology (mostly) and river diversion, but not recession agriculture. Motorized pumps, introduced under various schemes, were no longer in use due to farmers’ inability to meet fuel costs and repairs. Farmer access to land was largely under the control of individual farmers who pass on ownership to their children under traditional custom. This finding is contrary to the documented land policy which describes chiefs as custodians of the land. Many farmers viewed group farming as a surrender of their land ownership rights. However, team work was seen to be common in river diversion technologies where a committee was usually chosen to manage a main canal traversing several farms. Even under these circumstances, farmers still preferred to manage their plots individually. The economic analysis showed low farmer-benefits, except where flood recession agriculture was used to grow sweet potatoes, although this receives no attention from government or NGOs. Among the problems were the farmers’ inability to afford inputs, promotion of unsuitable technologies, and government controlled market prices. The study found that the increased wetland use was partly a livelihood diversification strategy linked to droughts and the worsening of the economic situations caused by structural adjustments in the early 1990 s. This study encourages government or NGOs to promote the technologies that are acceptable to the farmers and seen to benefit them under the local socioeconomic conditions. Locally, these include flood recession agriculture and small river diversions. Reducing production costs and increasing yields through more efficient water use and improved extension services should be encouraged, and subsidizing input costs and freeing market prices would also help.

Irrigation farming in the village studied began as traditional or <b>informal</b> <b>irrigation,</b> whereby vegetables were grown in dambo gardens with the use of bucket irrigation. By the early 1990 s, vegetable production in dambo gardens had become an important source of income for many farmers in the village.

Irrigated vegetable production in dambo gardens became more popular as an additional income generating activity after the mid- 1990 s when the agricultural marketing was liberalized. In the early 2000 s, some farmers in the village shifted from bucket irrigation to treadle pump irrigation with the assistance of an NGO. The introduction of treadle pumps entailed new methods in irrigation agronomy such as the use of furrows and pipes, the cultivation of winter maize, and more intensive use of land. The second half of the 2000 s is seeing another development in the use of irrigation technology, with some farmers introducing engine pumps and drip irrigation. As irrigation methods developed from bucket irrigation to treadle pump and engine pump irrigation, water consumption level of each farmer likely increased. The typical farming system found in the study area, which comprises the two practices is an expression of farmer adaptations in the face of uncertainties both in rainfall and market conditions. Introduction of new irrigation practices by some farmers can be considered as an expansion of the dambo gardening component of the system. The development interventions by NGOs played an important role in the adoption and diffusion of new irrigation technologies. Support from NGOs related to irrigation development placed greater emphasis on income generation and market sales. The villagers continuously invested in new agricultural management practices and land-care techniques. However, the investments and technology promoted are mainly associated with income-generating activities, which may undermine the capacity of ecosystems to produce services. The case of the village studied demonstrates that responses of the farmers were not necessarily unified, coordinated responses of the “community”. The responses to the new farming practices and NGO support mainly occurred at the level of individual farmers and farmers groups. As irrigation methods shifted to those entailing more capital intensive technology such as engine pumps, farmers’ responses to new opportunities depended increasingly on their resource or capital base including social capital. The shift from bucket irrigation to treadle pump and engine pump irrigation in the area has likely had a substantial impact on the use of water resources, especially groundwater. Since there are no customary or formal regulations on the use of groundwater, current opportunistic use of groundwater for irrigation can result in overuse of groundwater and might cause its decrease and depletion. It is crucial to introduce some mechanism of control and management of water resources which enables the sustainable use of this important resource. 和文のものは、英文の報告の内容を要約したものとなってい...|$|E
