They are also active before dawn. Since little brown bats live in a temperate zone, they must find some way of dealing with winter. Most temperate bats either migrate or <b>hibernate,</b> but little brown bats do both. In summer, the males and females live apart, the females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they mate and then <b>hibernate.</b> Little brown bats undergo a prolonged period of hibernation during the winter due to the lack of food.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess myocardial blood flow and coronary vasodilator reserve in <b>hibernating</b> myocardium before and after coronary revascularisation.  PATIENTS AND METHODS— 30  patients with multivessel coronary disease undergoing coronary revascularisation (21  patients with bypass grafting and nine with coronary angioplasty), and 21  age and sex matched healthy volunteers (controls). Myocardial blood flow (MBF, ml/min/g) was measured by positron emission tomography using oxygen- 15 water at rest and after dipyridamole (MBFdip, 0. 56  mg/kg in four minutes). Coronary vasodilator reserve was calculated as MBFdip/MBF. Regional wall motion was assessed with echocardiography.  RESULTS—Before revascularisation there were 48  remote and 275  dysfunctional myocardial segments, of which 163  (59 %) improved function after revascularisation (<b>hibernating).</b> In <b>hibernating</b> segments coronary vasodilator reserve before revascularisation was significantly lower than in remote segments (1. 97  (0. 7), p <  0. 0001) and controls (3. 2  (1. 5), p <  0. 0001). In <b>hibernating</b> segments, myocardial blood flow remained unchanged after revascularisation (0. 94  (0. 3) v 0. 95  (0. 3)  ml/min/g, p =  0. 3) while coronary vasodilator reserve increased (1. 47  (0. 7) v 1. 98  (1. 0), p <  0. 0001). Myocardial blood flow was similar in remote, <b>hibernating</b> segments before and after revascularisation and in controls.  CONCLUSIONS—This study confirms that myocardial blood flow at rest in <b>hibernating</b> myocardium is within normal limits in most segments, and that <b>hibernating</b> myocardium is characterised by an impaired coronary vasodilator reserve which improves significantly after coronary revascularisation.    Keywords: <b>hibernating</b> myocardium; myocardial blood flow; heart failure; positron emission tomograph...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess whether}} {{quantification}} of myocardial systolic velocities by pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging can differentiate between stunned, <b>hibernating,</b> and scarred myocardium. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS: 70 patients with reduced left ventricular function caused by chronic coronary artery disease. METHODS: Pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging was done {{close to the}} mitral annulus at rest and during low dose dobutamine; systolic ejection velocity (Vs) and the difference in Vs between low dose dobutamine and the resting value (DeltaVs) were assessed using a six segment model. Assessment of perfusion (with Tc- 99 m-tetrofosmin SPECT) and glucose utilisation (by 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose SPECT) was used to classify dysfunctional regions (by resting cross sectional echocardiography) as stunned, <b>hibernating,</b> or scarred. RESULTS: 253 of 420 regions (60 %) were dysfunctional. Of these, 132 (52 %) were classified as stunned, 25 (10 %) as <b>hibernating,</b> and 96 (38 %) as scarred. At rest, Vs in stunned, <b>hibernating,</b> and scar tissue was, respectively, 6. 3 (1. 8), 6. 6 (2. 2), and 5. 5 (1. 5) cm/s (p = 0. 001 by ANOVA). There was a gradual decline in Vs during low dose dobutamine infusion between stunned, <b>hibernating,</b> and scar tissue (8. 3 (2. 6) v 7. 8 (1. 5) v 6. 8 (1. 9) cm/s, p < 0. 001 by ANOVA).

During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea.

Daily torpor constitutes less than 24 hours of dormancy, whereas prolonged torpor averages two weeks in duration and signals hibernation. Mouse lemurs have been observed experiencing torpor that lasts for several consecutive days, but dwarf lemurs are known to <b>hibernate</b> for six to eight months every year, particularly {{on the west coast}} of Madagascar.|$|E

40|$|Lack of {{activity}} causes bone loss In most animals. <b>Hibernating</b> bears have physiological processes to prevent cortical and trabecular bone loss associated with reduced physical activity, but different mechanisms of torpor among <b>hibernating</b> species {{may lead to}} differences in skeletal responses to hibernation. There are conflicting reports regarding whether small mammals experience bone loss during hibernation. To investigate this phenomenon, we measured cortical and trabecular bone properties in physically active and <b>hibernating</b> juvenile and adult 13 -lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus, previous genus name Spermophilus). Cortical bone geometry, strength and mineral content were similar in <b>hibernating</b> compared with active squirrels, suggesting that hibernation did not cause macrostructural cortical bone loss. Osteocyte lacunar size increased (linear regression, P= 0. 001) {{over the course of}} hibernation in juvenile squirrels, which may indicate an osteocytic role in mineral homeostasis during hibernation. Osteocyte lacunar density and porosity were greater (+ 44 and + 59 %, respectively; P< 0. 0001) in <b>hibernating</b> compared with active squirrels, which may reflect a decrease in osteoblastic activity (per cell) during hibernation. Trabecular bone volume fraction in the proximal tibia was decreased (– 20 %; P= 0. 028) in <b>hibernating</b> compared with physically active adult squirrels, but was not different between <b>hibernating</b> and active juvenile squirrels. Taken together, these data suggest that 13 -lined ground squirrels may be unable to prevent microstructural losses of cortical and trabecular bone during hibernation, but importantly may possess a biological mechanism to preserve cortical bone macrostructure and strength during hibernation, thus preventing an increased risk of bone fracture during remobilization in the spring...|$|R
40|$|Background—Recovery of {{function}} {{is possible in}} patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy when left ventricular dysfunction is caused by stunning or hibernation. It is plausible that recovery {{of function}} after revascularization may take a longer time in <b>hibernating</b> myocardium compared with stunned myocardium. Accordingly, the time courses of functional recovery in <b>hibernating</b> and stunned myocardium were compared. Methods and Results—Patients (n 526) with ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing surgical revascularization were studied; regional perfusion (resting 201 Tl single-photon emission CT), glucose utilization (18 F- 2 -deoxyglucose single-photon emission CT), and contractile function (2 D echocardiography) were assessed before revascularization. Dysfunctional segments with normal perfusion/glucose utilization {{were considered to be}} stunned, and dysfunctional segments with reduced perfusion/preserved glucose utilization were considered to be <b>hibernating.</b> Contractile function was reevaluated 3 months (early) and 14 months (late) after revascularization. Of the 266 dysfunctional segments, 57 (22 %) were stunned, 62 (23 %) were <b>hibernating,</b> and 147 (55 %) were scar tissue. In stunned myocardium, contractile function improved significantly at 3 months, without further improvement at 14 months; 61 % of the stunned segments improved at 3 months, and 9 % improved at 14 months.

Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) normally sink {{to the bottom of}} the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen.

These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more deeply into the soft wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 Stroke is {{the third}} {{leading cause of death}} in the U. S. and the leading cause of adult onset {{disability}} worldwide. Despite tremendous efforts to find therapeutics, only one currently approved treatment for stroke exists which is indicated for use in less than 5 % of stroke victims. During a stroke, the brain experiences oxygen and nutrient deprivation due to lack of blood flow (i. e., ischemia) and tissue destruction ensues. <b>Hibernating</b> Arctic ground squirrels (AGS), Spermophilus parryii, are able to survive profound decreases in blood flow and cerebral perfusion during torpor, and return of blood flow (i. e., reperfusion) during intermittent euthermic periods without neurological damage. <b>Hibernating</b> species are a natural model of tolerance to insults, such as ischemia, that would be injurious to non-hibernating species, and are a novel model for investigating much needed therapeutics for pathologies such as stroke. Tolerance to traumatic brain injury demonstrated in <b>hibernating</b> AGS in vivo could be due to tissue properties, circulating factors or hypothermia. To investigate mechanisms of tolerance in brain of <b>hibernating</b> animals, the current project established a chronic culture system for hippocampal slices from AGS at 37 °C. By using this in vitro approach, tissue properties of AGS brain could be assessed without effects of circulating factors or the protective nature of hypothermia. This project determined whether an intrinsic tissue tolerance to oxygen and nutrient deprivation, an in vitro model of ischemia-reperfusion, persists in chronic AGS slice culture and addressed associated mechanisms. Here, for the first time, slices from <b>hibernating</b> AGS were shown to possess a persistent tolerance to oxygen and nutrient deprivation. Thus, intrinsic tissue properties in hippocampus of <b>hibernating</b> AGS confer tolerance to oxygen and nutrient deprivation in addition to hypothermia. Evidence in the literature supports that neuroprotective factors are present in serum and tissue of <b>hibernating</b> animals, and here a preliminary investigation suggests that factors in AGS serum {{may play a role in}} protection in brain of <b>hibernating</b> AGS. Finally, a model is proposed that incorporates these findings, which suggests that mimicking properties of tissue and serum from <b>hibernating</b> animals in non-hibernating species may yield success in developing efficacious stroke therapeutics...|$|R

40|$|The term <b>hibernating</b> {{myocardium}} {{describes a}} particular outcome of myocardial ischemia in which myocytes show a chronically depressed contractile ability but remain viable. Revascularization of <b>hibernating</b> tissue causes a recovery of mechanical function that correlates with long-term survival. Therefore {{it is important}} clinically to distinguish <b>hibernating</b> from infarcted myocardium, since asynergies due to hibernation will improve on reperfusion, whilst those due to infarct will not. One suggested technique to identify <b>hibernating</b> myocardium is to stimulate the myocytes acutely, but briefly, by administration of inotropic agents while monitoring contractile function by echocardiography. We report our experience {{on the use of}} low dosages of dobutamine. Myocardial viability was validated by measuring the recovery in contraction of the akinetic areas after coronary artery bypass surgery by means of intraoperative epicardial echocardiography. The test has a sensitivity of 93 % and a specificity of 78 %. It is useful for identification of viable myocardium and also for quantification of intraoperative risk in individual patients. Limitations of this test are related to the presence of downregulation of beta receptors and to the impossibility of differentiating <b>hibernating</b> from stunned myocardium. Another useful technique of identifying <b>hibernating</b> myocardium is the use of radionuclear markers for viability. In our experience the two most important tests are (1) rest-redistribution imaging of thallium 201 (which has a high sensitivity of 93 % but a low specificity of 44 %) and (2) 99 mTc-Sestamibi imaging, which provides information on both perfusion and function with a single injection.
