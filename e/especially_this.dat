25|$|Although some {{scholars}} have supported its creation under Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305), the office can first be definitely traced {{to the rule of}} Roman emperor Constantine I (r. 306–337), in 320. Constantine probably created it in an effort to limit the power of the praetorian prefect (praefectus praetorio), until then the Roman emperor's chief administrative aide. The magister supervised the palatine secretariat, divided into four bureaux, the sacra scrinia, each under a respective magister: the scrinium memoriae, the scrinium epistularum, the scrinium libellorum and the scrinium epistolarum Graecarum. The first bureau handled imperial decisions called annotationes, because they were notes made by the emperor on documents presented to him, and also handled replies to petitions to the emperor. The second handled correspondence with foreign potentates and with the provincial administration and the cities, the third dealt with appeals from lower courts and petitions from those involved in them, and the fourth handled the documents issued in Greek and the translation of Latin documents into Greek. Another important duty transferred to the office by Constantine was the supervision of the agentes in rebus, a corps of trusted messengers who also functioned as controllers of the imperial administration. <b>Especially</b> <b>this</b> control of the feared agentes, or magistriani, as they were colloquially known, gave the office great power. The office rose quickly in importance: initially ranked as a tribunus, by the end of Constantine's reign the magister was a full comes.|$|E

500|$|All of Angelou's autobiographies, <b>especially</b> <b>this</b> {{volume and}} its predecessor, is [...] "very much {{concerned}} with what [...] knew and how she learned it". [...] Lupton compares Angelou's informal education described in this book with the education of other Black writers of the 20th century. [...] Like writers such as Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, and James Baldwin, Angelou did not earn a college degree and depended upon the [...] "direct instruction of African American cultural forms". She {{did not feel that}} her education ended at high school, however. [...] As Hagen points out, since Angelou was encouraged to appreciate literature as a young child, she continues to read, exposing herself {{to a wide variety of}} authors, ranging from Countee Cullen's poetry to Leo Tolstoy and other Russian authors. She states, during her stint as a madame, [...] "when my life hinged melodramatically on intrigue and deceit, I discovered the Russian writers".|$|E

David Browne of Time wrote [...] "tracks like 'Dark Fantasy' and 'So Appalled' are built on rumbling tanks of pianos and strings that sound as if West is marching into the apocalypse." [...] Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine stated that the song restored his admiration for West, and that the track {{lived up to the}} hype behind it, writing [...] "most of it is rather epic and damn good, <b>especially</b> <b>this</b> track with its classic RZA production and assistance from No I.D.." [...] J. Tinsley of The Smoking Section commented that the song served as a successful opener, viewing it as a [...] "boisterous firestarter combining sharp lyrics, a spurious Nicki Minaj English accent and an enormous chorus." [...] Chris Martins of Spin complimented West's lyricism and use of double entrendres, and mused that the track was the album's [...] "beyond luxe opener". Jonah Weiner Slate commented that West pulled off an impressive balancing act, and cited the song as an example of [...] "his marvelous, hungry ear". Andrew Barber of Complex compared the impact of the beat to that of a cannon, calling the production team of the song a [...] "dream team", describing the track as powerful in nature.|$|E
