5|$|<b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> that, {{like many}} others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
25|$|Delivering a eulogy for a {{close friend}} and for someone who was so much admired is never a happy occasion. Though <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> I would be quite happy to deliver a eulogy for a certain media {{personality}} who's tried the second Kennedy assassination of our time... and failed.|$|E
25|$|The War whoop of anarchy, the Marseillais Hymn, is to my ear, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess,</b> {{independently}} of all moral association, a most dismal, flat, and unpleasing ditty: and to any ear {{it is at}} any rate a long winded and complicated one. In the instance of a melody so mischievous in its application, it is a fortunate incident, if, in itself, it should be doomed neither in point of universality, nor permanence, to gain equal hold on the affections of the people.|$|E
60|$|Q. What <b>must</b> <b>I</b> confess?--A. Thou <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> thy transgressions {{unto the}} Lord (Psa 32:5).|$|R
60|$|And here <b>I</b> <b>must</b> frankly <b>confess</b> {{that the}} mode in which I {{conducted}} the story scarcely deserved the success which the romance afterwards attained.|$|R
6000|$|THOROUGHLY disheartened and disgusted, and (if <b>I</b> <b>must</b> {{honestly}} <b>confess</b> it) thoroughly frightened too, I {{whispered to}} Mrs. Macallan, [...] "I was wrong, {{and you were}} right. Let us go." ...|$|R
500|$|Bush {{said his}} wife has had a {{stabilizing}} effect on his life, and attributes his 1986 decision to give up alcohol to her influence. While Governor of Texas, Bush said of his wife, [...] "I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and {{willing to put up}} with my rough edges, and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> has smoothed them off over time." ...|$|E
500|$|The boy was baptised at the Church of St Nicolas, Guildford, and {{was named}} after his godfather, Pelham von Donop. Wodehouse wrote in 1957, [...] "If you ask {{me to tell you}} frankly if I like the name Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> that I do not.... I was named after a godfather, and not a thing to show for it but a small silver mug which I lost in 1897." [...] The first name was rapidly elided to [...] "Plum", the name by which Wodehouse became known to family and friends.|$|E
500|$|Lost critic Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine {{noted that}} like the season premiere, the episode [...] "mostly serves to add uncomfortable {{wrinkles}} {{to one of}} the show's saints, {{going so far as to}} make the consistently sympathetic Sun quite unlikable." [...] He added [...] "While I... question the need for the flashbacks, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> to finding this particular episode more wonderfully twisted than usual." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly wrote [...] "Last week's Jin/Sun episode was something of a disappointment, not because it was a bad episode of Lost, per se (I would give it a solid B), but because it wasn't as good as the exhilarating season premiere (which I would give an A+)." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>must</b> still <b>confess</b> that <b>I</b> {{never did}} hear it under similar circumstances, except in {{conversation}} across {{half a mile}} of lagoon, when, as usual, {{the burden of the}} lay was polenta or soldi.|$|R
6000|$|... "As many creatures as you like. Your freedom's {{complete}} and, {{as far as}} I'm concerned, {{always will}} be.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>must</b> candidly <b>confess</b> {{that the}} English-speaking people one meets {{with on the}} Continent are, taken as a whole, a most disagreeable contingent. One hardly ever hears the English {{language}} spoken on the Continent, without hearing grumbling and sneering.|$|R
500|$|Both {{the public}} and critics were unnerved {{by the sight of}} the work. Russell {{describes}} being shocked by [...] "images so unrelievedly awful that the mind shut with a snap at the sight of them. Their anatomy was half-human, half-animal, and they were confined in a low-ceilinged, windowless and oddly proportioned space. They could bite, probe, and suck, and they had very long eel-like necks, but their functioning in other respects was mysterious. Ears and mouths they had, but two at least of them were sightless." [...] Writing for Apollo magazine, Herbert Furst recalled, [...] "I, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess,</b> was so shocked and disturbed by the Surrealism of Francis Bacon that I was glad to escape from this exhibition. Perhaps it was the red [...] background that made me think of entrails, of an anatomy or a vivisection and feel squeamish. [...] The triptych caused a sensation, and overnight turned Bacon into the most controversial painter in the country.|$|E
500|$|The most {{well-documented}} early European {{team was}} founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, [...] "I founded the association late last year , with the fixed resolve of proving {{to the world that}} women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess,</b> my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most." [...] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.|$|E
500|$|Historian George Herring {{argues that}} Adams {{was the most}} independent-minded of the founders. Though he aligned with the Federalists, he was {{somewhat}} a party unto himself, disagreeing with the Federalists {{as much as he}} did the Democratic-Republicans. He was often described as [...] "prickly", but his tenacity was fed by good decisions made in the face of universal opposition. Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as Adams himself admitted in his old age: [...] " [...] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore." [...] Adams' resolve to advance peace with France, rather than to continue hostilities, especially reduced his popularity. This {{played an important role in}} his reelection defeat, however he was so pleased with the outcome that he had it engraved on his tombstone. Adams spent much of his term at home in Massachusetts, ignoring the details of political patronage nursed by other office holders.|$|E

60|$|Pand. Why, {{you know}} it is dimpled. I cannot chuse but laugh, to think how she tickled his cloven chin.

60|$|March 7th. I am almost {{ashamed to}} write it down, even in this journal, which no eyes but mine ever look on; yet <b>I</b> <b>must</b> {{honestly}} <b>confess</b> to myself that here I am, at nearly one in the morning, sitting up {{in a state of}} serious uneasiness because Mary has not yet come home.|$|R
500|$|At {{the insistence}} of {{publishers}} Grosset & Dunlap, the Nancy Drew books were revised beginning in 1959, both to make the books more modern and to eliminate racist stereotypes. Although Harriet Adams felt that these changes were unnecessary, she oversaw a complete overhaul of the series, as well as writing new volumes {{in keeping with the}} new guidelines laid down by Grosset & Dunlap. The series did not so much eliminate racial stereotypes, however, as eliminate non-white characters altogether. For example, in the original version of The Hidden Window Mystery (1956), Nancy visits friends in the south whose African-American servant, [...] "lovable old Beulah... serves squabs, sweet potatoes, corn pudding, piping hot biscuits, and strawberry shortcake." [...] The mistress of the house waits until Beulah has left the room and then says to Nancy, [...] "I try to make things easier for Beulah but she insists on cooking and serving everything the old-fashioned way. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess,</b> though, that I love it." [...] In the revised 1975 version, Beulah is changed to Anna, a [...] "plump, smiling housekeeper".|$|E
500|$|For {{the most}} part, British commanders {{did not hold}} Patton in high regard. Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke noted in January 1943 that [...] "I had heard of him, but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> that his swashbuckling {{personality}} exceeded my expectation. I did not form any high opinion of him, nor had I any reason to alter this view at any later date. A dashing, courageous, wild and unbalanced leader, good for operations requiring thrust and push but at a loss in any operation requiring skill and judgment." [...] One possible exception was Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. Although the latter's rivalry with Patton was well known, Montgomery appears to have admired Patton's ability to command troops in the field, if not his strategic judgment. Other Allied commanders were more impressed, the Free French in particular. General Henri Giraud was incredulous when he heard of Patton's dismissal by Eisenhower in late 1945, and invited him to Paris to be decorated by President Charles de Gaulle at a state banquet. At the banquet, President de Gaulle gave a speech placing Patton's achievements alongside those of Napoleon. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was apparently an admirer, stating that the Red Army could neither have planned nor executed Patton's rapid armored advance across France.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{myself was}} very sceptical that the {{beautiful}} link between Fermat’s Last Theorem and the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture would actually lead to anything, because <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> I {{did not think}} that the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture was accessible to proof. Beautiful though this problem was, it seemed impossible to actually prove. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> I thought I probably wouldn’t see it proved in my lifetime." ...|$|E

2500|$|I am {{often asked}} how I went about writing an opera for television, {{and what are}} the {{specific}} problems that I had to face in planning a work for such a medium. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> that in writing [...] "Amahl and the Night Visitors," [...] I hardly thought of television at all. As a matter of fact, all my operas are originally conceived for an ideal stage which has no equivalent in reality, and I believe that such is the case with most dramatic authors. —Gian-Carlo Menotti ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> I've still {{yet to be}} {{convinced}} that Cose is ready for test cricket. Last summer he earned his test place, and confirmed it with his century in Melbourne. But since then a question mark has arisen over his dedication to cricket, and also over his ability to play on wickets which are doing a bit. And he is definitely suspect outside his off stump. I'd like to see Gary work harder at his game. He appears to be overweight and I wonder how hard {{he is prepared to}} work at his batting at this stage.|$|E
2500|$|... ‘From hence , {{keeping the}} London Road, I came to Chelmsford, {{mentioned}} before, and Ingatestone, five miles west, which I mention again {{because in the}} Parish Church of this town are to be seen the ancient monuments if the noble family of Petre whose seat and large estate lie in the neighbourhood, and whose family, by constant series of beneficent action to the poor, and bounty upon all charitable occasions, have gained an affectionate esteem through all {{that part of the}} County, such as no prejudice of religion could wear out, or perhaps ever may – and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> need not, for good and great actions commend our respect, let the opinions of persons be otherwise what they may’.|$|E

60|$|The judge {{took his}} seat. The {{prisoner}} was brought in. Every eye seemed bent upon him. He was neatly and plainly dressed, and, rogue though he was, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> honestly <b>confess</b> {{he looked at}} least a gentleman. His manner was defiant, not abject like Charles's. He knew he was at bay, and he turned like a man to face his accusers.|$|R
60|$|And <b>I</b> <b>must</b> also <b>confess</b> {{that even}} he whom I loved so dearly did not spend overly {{much time in}} caressing me, nor did he utter one word of praise. It was to him that I had simply done what any lad of Virginia should have done, and he was satisfied, rather than proud, that I had acted the part.|$|R
2500|$|Brooks then briefly {{returned}} to Wichita, {{where she was}} raised. [...] "But {{that turned out to}} be another kind of hell," [...] she said. [...] "The citizens of Wichita either resented me having been a success or despised me for being a failure. And I wasn't exactly enchanted with them. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> to a lifelong curse: My own failure as a social creature." [...] After an unsuccessful attempt at operating a dance studio, she returned East and, after brief stints as a radio actor and a gossip columnist, worked as a salesgirl in a Saks Fifth Avenue store in New York City for a few years, then lived as a courtesan with a few select wealthy men as clients.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first man}} from Pitcairn to board Briton soon proved who the islanders were. His name, he said, was Thursday October Christian, the first {{born on the}} island and son of Fletcher Christian. [...] "He was then about twenty-five years of age, a fine young man, about six feet high, his hair deep black, his countenance open and interesting, of a {{brownish}} cast, but free from all that mixture of a reddish tint which prevails on the Pacific islands; his only dress was a piece of cloth round his loins, and a straw hat, ornamented with the black feathers of the domestic fowl... we were glad to trace in his benevolent countenance all the features of an honest English face. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess,</b> I could not survey his interesting person without feelings of tenderness and compassion." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{have heard}} the order, and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> are in a pretty {{condition}} to obey it. I will have to return it with the endorsement upon the back that 'the First Maryland refuses to meet the enemy', despite being given orders by General Jackson. Before this day I was proud to call myself a Marylander, but now, God knows, I would rather be known as anything else. Shame on you to bring this stigma upon the fair name of your native state - to cause the finger of scorn to be pointed at those who confided to your keeping their most sacred trust - their honor {{and that of the}} glorious Old State. Marylanders you call yourselves - profane not that hallowed name again, for it is not yours. What Marylander ever before threw down his arms and deserted his colors {{in the presence of the}} enemy, and those arms, and those colors too, placed in your hands by a woman? Never before has one single blot defaced her honored history. Could it be possible to conceive a crime more atrocious, an outrage more damnable? Go home and publish to the world your infamy. Boast of it when you meet your fathers and mothers, brothers, sisters and sweethearts. Tell them it was you who, when brought face to face with the enemy, proved yourselves recreants, and acknowledged yourselves to be cowards. Tell them this, and see if you are not spurned from their presence like some loathsome leper, and despised, detested, nay abhorred, by those whose confidence you have so shamefully betrayed; you will wander over the face of the earth with the brand of 'coward', 'traitor', indelibly imprinted on your foreheards, and in the end sink into a dishonored grave, unwept for, uncared for, leaving behind as a heritage to your posterity the scorn and contempt of every honest man and virtuous woman in the land." ...|$|E
