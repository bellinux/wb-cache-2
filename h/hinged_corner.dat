40|$|We {{devise a}} generic recipe for {{constructing}} $D$-dimensional lattice models whose $d$-dimensional boundary states, located on surfaces, <b>hinges,</b> <b>corners</b> and so forth, {{can be obtained}} exactly. The solvability {{is rooted in the}} underlying lattice structure and does not as such depend on fine-tuning, allowing us to track their evolution throughout various phases and across phase transitions. Most saliently, our models provide "boundary solvable" examples of the recently introduced higher order topological phases. We apply our general approach to breathing and anisotropic kagome and pyrochlore lattices for which we obtain exact corner eigenstates, and to periodically driven two-dimensional models as well as to truly three-dimensional pyrochlore and stacked honeycomb lattices where we present exact solutions corresponding to one-dimensional chiral states at the hinges of the lattice. We relate the higher order topological nature of these models to reflection symmetries in combination with their provenance from lower-dimensional conventional topological phases.

40|$|Glass panes, applied as {{building}} material in façades, normally have flexible boundaries which allow free deformation in plane, {{in order to}} avoid thermal stresses and breakage caused by temperature loads. In case glass panes are used as in plane loaded structural components in façades, e. g. as part of a diaphragm wall, a stiff connection between glass pane and adjoining structure is required because of the desired direct transfer of forces. This contradicts with the previous statement of a flexible connection needed for thermal expansion. A series of six full-scale tests has been conducted to explore this problem. The experimental set-up involved a single glass pane within a rigid steel frame with <b>hinged</b> <b>corners</b> connected by a continuous bond line along the edges. The glass pane was subjected to a temperature load induced by an array of infrared lights. To conduct a parameter study, a finite element model has been developed to simulate the experiments. Parameters included were the glass thickness, glass type (clear or tinted), and the type of the bond line (polyurethane or epoxy). The paper describes the results of the tests, the development of the finite element model, and the results of the parameter study...|$|R
40|$|Teleoperation master {{hands with}} force {{feedback}} {{are used in}} the project more and more widely and the design requirements about their structure sizes and the scope of work space are also increasing. In order to expand work space of the master hand robot, and to ensure its kinematic accuracy, the structure size parameters of the master hand robot are designed by multi-objective optimization method in the paper, using its work space, output power on its end, as well as precision-weighted inverse solution as optimizing targets. Firstly, the model of parameter optimization is established by taking the radius of upper and lower platform as well as the lengths of the long and short poles of the master hand robot as design variables. Its output power and <b>hinge</b> <b>corner</b> are analyzed as a motion constraints. The objective function of parameter optimization model is based on a weighted form of work space and Jacobi conditions. Then, Model is simulated and calculated by genetic algorithm. The results show that optimized parameters make the scope of work space improved greatly, as well as increasing in accuracy of inverse kinematics and output force.

50|$|The ThinkPad 11e is a Chromebook {{that has}} a matte black chassis with {{reinforced}} <b>hinges</b> and <b>corners,</b> a sturdy lid, and a rubber bumper protecting its display {{in order to help}} it survive accidental dropping, spills, and general rough handling. It uses a quad-core Intel Celeron CPU, has 4 GB of RAM which can not be upgraded, an 11.6 inch screen, and 16GB or eMMC flash storage. Reviewers claim it is somewhat heavier than a typical Chromebook with a weight of 3.1 pounds. This is likely because of its ruggedized and reinforced chassis.|$|R
50|$|Single-wheel {{trailers}} generally use {{a special}} frame hitch which attaches {{to both sides}} of the rear axle, and which incorporates a vertical <b>hinge</b> to allow <b>cornering.</b> Attaching the trailer at the seat-post can (dependent on the design) place the load at a lower point relative to the longitudinal pivot axis of the attached trailer. This can make it possible to wheel a loaded single-wheel trailer around while disconnected from the bike, as the seat-post hitch is a natural height for grasping while walking upright.|$|R

40|$|Biologically {{inspired}} pressure actuated cellular structures {{can alter}} their shape through pressure variations. Previous work introduced a computational framework for pressure actuated cellular structures which {{was limited to}} two cell rows and central cell <b>corner</b> <b>hinges.</b> This article rigorously extends these results by taking into account an arbitrary number of cell rows, a more complicated cell kinematics that includes hinge eccentricities and varying side lengths as well as rotational and axial cell side springs. The nonlinear effects of arbitrary cell deformations are fully considered. Furthermore, the optimization is considerably improved by using a second-order approach. The presented framework enables the design of compliant pressure actuated cellular structures that can change their form from one shape to another within a set of one-dimensional C 1 continuous functions.

40|$|An {{innovative}} strengthening {{technique is}} {{applied for the}} first time in this study to provide flexural strengthening in two-way reinforced concrete (RC) slabs supported on edge beams. The technique comprises external bonding of textiles on the tension face of RC slabs through the use of polymer-modified cement- based mortars. The textiles used in the experimental campaign comprised fabric meshes made of long stitch-bonded fibre rovings in two orthogonal directions. The specimens measured 2 x 2 m in plan and were supported on <b>hinges</b> at the <b>corners.</b> Three RC slabs strengthened by textile reinforced mortar (TRM) overlays and one control specimen were tested to failure. One specimen received one layer of carbon fibre textile, another one received two, whereas the third specimen was strengthened with three layers of glass fibre textile having the same axial rigidity (in both directions) with the single-layered carbon fibre textile. All specimens failed due to flexural punching. The load-carrying capacity of the strengthened slabs was increased by 26 %, 53 %, and 20 % over that of the control specimen for slabs with one (carbon), two (carbon) and three (glass) textile layers, respectively. The strengthened slabs showed an increase in stiffness and energy absorption. The experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions based on existing models specifically developed for two-way slabs and the performance of the latter is evaluated. Based on the findings of this work the authors conclude that TRM overlays comprise a very promising solution for the strengthening of two-way RC slabs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{site of the}} new Tallinn Town Hall {{designed}} by the BIG architects is situated {{to the north of}} the medieval city center on the edge of the green ring close to the waterfront. The goal is to create a new urban typology that combines the human scale and intimate experience of the medieval townscape, with the public space and municipal symbolism of the modern extension. The New Town Hall will be an open and permeable public institution, extending both town center and the green ring all the way to the water's edge. The building will be created of a village of ten individual departments and two for common space and meeting rooms. Each department is accommodated in its own dedicated office building. A thirteenth building, the tower hosts the City Government, the City Council and the Council Hall on the top floor. The departments are grouped together to meet the programmatic requirements of adjacencies. The departments are consolidated in a village-like cluster, allowing them to perform as a single open office structure as well as ten independent departments. The departments are <b>hinged</b> on the <b>corners</b> and rotated to leave courtyards for daylight and views between them. The many generous openings also provide views to the public ground floor below as well as the sky above. The current paper gives an overview of the daylight modeling and facade design, describes passive architectural cooling strategies considered. Estonia is situated in latitude 59 ° which means that the solar angle of incidence is rather low from late autumn to early spring. The maximum solar angle of incident is just 7 ° in December 21 st. Then at the other side the summer temperatures are of average 27 °C which makes the shading strategies essential. The building is currently in detail design phase and the construction work will presumably start in early 2014. The building has been already shortlisted for a World Architecture Festival Award in the Future Projects and Competition entries category...|$|R
