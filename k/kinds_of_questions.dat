25|$|Differential {{geometry}} {{came into}} its own when Einstein used it in general relativity. Entirely new areas of mathematics such as mathematical logic, topology, and John von Neumann's game theory changed the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> that could be answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of structures were abstracted using axioms and given names like metric spaces, topological spaces etc. As mathematicians do, {{the concept of an}} abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to category theory. Grothendieck and Serre recast algebraic geometry using sheaf theory. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of dynamical systems that Poincaré had begun in the 1890s.|$|E
500|$|Many feminists call {{attention}} to value judgments in economic analysis. This idea {{is contrary to the}} typical conception of economics as a positive science held by many practitioners. For example, Geoff Schneider and Jean Shackelford suggest that [...] "the issues that economists choose to study, the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> they ask, and the type of analysis undertaken all are a product of a belief system which is influenced by numerous factors, some of them ideological in character." [...] Similarly, Diana Strassmann comments, [...] "All economic statistics are based on an underlying story forming the basis of the definition. In this way, narrative constructions necessarily underlie all definitions of variables and statistics. [...] Therefore, economic research cannot escape being inherently qualitative, regardless of how it is labeled." [...] Feminist economists {{call attention}} to the value judgements in all aspects economics and criticize its depiction of an objective science.|$|E

Johnson, and retired grandparents, Lula and Frank Hill. In 1950, Shakur's parents {{divorced}} and she moved with her grandparents to Wilmington, North Carolina. Shakur moved back to Queens {{with her mother and}} stepfather after elementary school, attending Parsons Junior High School. However, she still frequently visited her grandparents in the south. The family struggled financially, and argued frequently; Shakur spent little time at home. She often ran away, staying with strangers and working for short periods of time, until she was taken in by her mother's sister Evelyn A. Williams, a civil rights worker, who lived in Manhattan. She has said that her aunt was the heroine of her childhood, as she was constantly introducing her to new things. She said that her aunt was [...] "very sophisticated and knew all kinds of things. She was right up my alley because i [...] was forever asking all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions.</b> I wanted to know everything." [...] Williams often took her to museums, theaters, and art galleries, and the conflicts that did rise between the two were typically due to Shakur's habit of lying.|$|E

Accordingly, “Maya civilization” is both a reality [...] - as John Lloyd Stephens first discovered - and a scholarly construct, with strands in the weave composed of actual patterns and “emergent” entities and characteristics but also of patterns and agentive decisions historically in the scholarly world, these, themselves, retroactively considered and reconsidered.|$|E

Except for an occasional sound in the yellow-lit forecastle and a movement of the animals now and then, the night was very still.

He spoke like a man who had loved his life there, and had been suddenly and irrevocably cut off from it. I gossiped as well as I could of this and that.

You could have come over so often, as a bachelor,--for it was a thorough bachelor's mansion--plenty of wine and such sordid sensualities--with books enough, room enough, and an air of antiquity about all (except the lasses) that would have suited you, when pensive, and served you to laugh at when in glee. I had built myself a bath and a vault--and now I sha'n't even be buried in it. It is odd that we can't even be certain of a grave, at least a particular one. I remember, when about fifteen, reading your poems there, which I can repeat almost now,--and asking all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> about the author, when I heard that he was not dead according to the preface; wondering if I should ever see him--and though, at that time, without the smallest poetical propensity myself, very much taken, as you may imagine, with that volume.

6000|$|His father, who was {{sometimes}} exacting, complained of concealment. Mr. Gladstone {{replied that he}} regarded the question as one of difficulty, and he therefore took {{as much time as}} he possibly could for reflection upon it, though he never intended to run it as close as it actually came. 'I know,' he says, in a notable sentence, 'it seems strange to you that I should find it necessary to hold my judgment in suspense on a question which seemed to many so plain; but suspense is of constant occurrence in public life upon very many <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions,</b> and without it errors and inconsistencies would be much more frequent than even they are now.' This did not satisfy his father. 'I shall certainly read your speech to find some fair apology for your vote: good and satisfactory reason I do not expect. I cannot doubt you thought you withheld your opinions from me under the undecided state you were in, without any intention whatever to annoy me. There is, however, a natural closeness in your disposition, with a reserve towards those who may think they may have some claim to your confidence, probably increased by official habits, which it may perhaps in some cases be worth your inquiring into.' The sentence above about suspense is a key to many misunderstandings of Mr. Gladstone's character. His stouthearted friend Thomas Acland had warned him, {{for the sake of his}} personal influence, to be sure to deal with the Jew question on broad grounds, without refining, and without dragging out some recondite view not seen by common men, 'in short, to be as little as possible like Maurice, and more like the Duke of Wellington.' 'My speech,' Mr. Gladstone answered, 'was most unsatisfactory in many ways, but I do not believe that it mystified or puzzled anybody.' ...|$|E

The aims of the research are to describe <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>question</b> sentence, the pragmatics function and equivalent analysis in the <b>question</b> sentence. <b>Kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>question</b> sentence are divided into two yes-no questions and wh-questions. while the pragmatics functions can be seen at the illocution force in the sentences. It’s also divided into two: real questions and rhetorical questions. Different with real question, rhetorical question has interrogative grammatical forms but nonquestions meaning. The equivalent analysis is concerned about equivalent and non equivalent in translation <b>of</b> the <b>question</b> sentence. The result of the research shows there are different application <b>of</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>question</b> sentence in SL and TL.

About the pragmatics function, the result of research shows that there are 50 data as a rhetorical questions, and the biggest number is question sentence which has the angry illocution force.

She was either deeply cynical or still more deeply impenetrable, and he had little {{prospect}} of winning from her the intimation that he longed for--some hint that it had come over her that after all she had better have married a man who was not a by-word for the most contemptible, the least heroic, of vices. Had she not seen--had she not felt--the smile go round when her husband executed some especially characteristic conversational caper? How could a woman of her quality endure that day after day, year after year, except by her quality's altering? But he would believe in the alteration only when he should have heard her lie. He was fascinated by his problem and yet half exasperated, and he asked himself all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions.</b> Did she not lie, after all, when she let his falsehoods pass without a protest? Was not her life a perpetual complicity, and did she not aid and abet him by the simple fact that she was not disgusted with him? Then again perhaps she was disgusted and it was the mere desperation of her pride that had given her an inscrutable mask. Perhaps she protested in private, passionately; perhaps every night, in their own apartments, after the day's hideous performance, she made him the most scorching scene. But if such scenes were of no avail and he took no more trouble to cure himself, how could she regard him, and after so many years of marriage too, with the perfectly artless complacency that Lyon had surprised in her {{in the course of the}} first day's dinner? If our friend had not been in love with her he could have taken the diverting view of the Colonel's delinquencies; but as it was they turned to the tragical in his mind, even while he had a sense that his solicitude might also have been laughed at.|$|E
