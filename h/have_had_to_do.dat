25|$|But {{he begged}} the Court's indulgence because under Kenosha v. Bruno, {{another one of}} the cases {{following}} Monroe, if the school district had the same Eleventh Amendment immunity as a municipality Doyle could not seek equitable relief such as his reinstatement against the board as an entity; he would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it against the members personally. If the case were remanded in its present state, he said, he would be unable to proceed even if he won on all the other issues. Since Congress had changed the federal-question statute since Bivens, he felt that created the implied cause of action from the enabling language in the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{preparations}} for provoking the Dutch into yet another war, was {{the appointment of}} Holmes as senior officer in Portsmouth, commanding a powerful squadron and the flagship St Michael, a first-rate of 90 guns. Holmes immediately pressed for the capture {{of a large number}} of Dutch ships, using English harbours under foreign colours; but the government procrastinated until the opportunity was gone. On 23 March 1672, he finally got permission to attack the homeward-bound Dutch Smyrna convoy. For two days, the English squadron fought a veritable battle with the armed merchantmen and their escorts, suffering damage out of proportion to their gains, half a dozen prizes only one of which seems to have been one of the rich Smyrna ships. Accidentally, Sir Edward Spragge's squadron, returning from the Mediterranean, had passed the scene immediately before the engagement. For unknown reasons, Spragge did not join the attack nor was invited by Holmes to do so, which gave rise to new mutual suspicions. A few days after the fight war was declared and flags handed out. Holmes did not receive one, which may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the limited number of posts available due to the white squadron this time consisting of the French fleet. Accordingly, Holmes fought in the ensuing Battle of Solebay as a mere captain in the Duke of York's squadron. The battle, the fiercest in De Ruyter's memory, claimed the lives of Holmes's friends Holles and Sandwich, and forced the Lord High Admiral to transfer his flag twice, from Prince to Holmes's St Michael and from that to London. With Sandwich dead, a new flag officer had to be appointed, but Holmes's legitimate claims were again disregarded - for the last time. After the end of the 1672 campaign, Holmes did not get another command, notwithstanding the constant intercession on his behalf of the new commander-in-chief, his stout friend Prince Rupert. Obviously, the King himself had no desire to re-employ him. Holmes's naval career had very abruptly ended.|$|E

30|$|The most {{powerful}} impact {{the financial crisis}} <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with our too narrow understanding of how economies work. That the financial crisis can be counted {{to belong to the}} works of “animal spirits” is possible through the tremendously important work of two of the top-economists of the world, Robert Schiller and George Akerlöf. In their seminal work, with this title, they showed how the financial crisis was essentially brought about because of the bad leadership of governments over private market actors. Indeed, there is a substantial amount of evidence of bad leadership, whether in regional structures, national governments or in private companies, that led to this rather disproportionate crisis, to be equaled only with the Great Recession of the 1930 s [4].|$|R

50|$|Although a 'college engineer' (högskoleingenjör, diplomingenjör/mellaningenjör (Swedish), høgskoleingeniør (Norwegian), diplomingeniør (Danish)) {{is roughly}} {{equivalent}} to a Bachelor of Science in Scandinavia, to become a 'civil engineer' one often <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> up <b>to</b> one extra year of overlapping studies compared to attaining a B.Sc./M.Sc. combination.

2500|$|When Edward Bruce invaded Ireland in 1315, Hugh Byset and {{the heads}} of several other families, Norman and Gaelic, joined Sir Thomas de Mandeville in {{opposing}} him.

In any event, their mixed Norman-Irish force, importantly lacking the immediate support of the otherwise occupied Earl of Ulster, Richard Óg de Burgh (who was mustering an army from his domains in Connacht), was defeated by one led by Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray, and the Scottish army then proceeded south to Carrickfergus.

A journalist noted in 1947 that Dewey [...] "has never made the slightest attempt to capitalize on his enormous fame, except politically.

2500|$|While {{the engine}} was {{producing}} exceptional power for its displacement, the reason it was not put into production may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with its weight. Both the Rolls Royce/Packard Merlin V-1650 and the Allison V-1710 were in production, with similar power and better Power/Weight Ratios. The V-1710 was 1395lbs, 385 pounds lighter than I-1430 with a power-to-weight ratio of 1.05. The Merlin V-1650 weighed in at 1640, 25 pounds more than the smaller and unproven Continental with about the same power/weight ratio of about 1.00. It did not seem the XI-1430 would be the solution to any important problem.

2500|$|The {{government}} {{refused to}} implement the 1926 recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission, which included restoring Irish as the language of administration in such areas. As {{the role of the}} state grew, it therefore exerted tremendous pressure on Irish speakers to use English. This was only partly offset by measures which were supposed to support the Irish language. For instance, the state was by far the largest employer. A qualification in Irish was required to apply for state jobs. However, this did not require a high level of fluency, and few public employees were ever required to use Irish in the course of their work. On the other hand, state employees had to have perfect command of English and had to use it constantly. Because most public employees had a poor command of Irish, it was impossible to deal with them in Irish. If an Irish speaker wanted to apply for a grant, obtain electricity, or complain about being over-taxed, they would typically <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in English. As late as 1986, a Bord na Gaeilge report noted [...] "...the administrative agencies of the state have been among the strongest forces for Anglicisation in Gaeltacht areas".|$|E
2500|$|The MacDonnell {{claim to}} the Glens of Antrim dated from the {{marriage}} of Margery Byset, a daughter of the Mac Eoin, to John Mór MacDonnell, the second son of John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, in the 1390s. From the date of this marriage, or soon after, he and their descendants, the Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg, considered the Lordship of the Glens to be theirs and styled themselves lords of [...] "Dunnyveg and the Glens", first found being styled so in a document dating to 1403. However the male line of the Bissetts was certainly [...] "far from extinct," [...] and whatever gains made by the MacDonnells are uncertain. Bissett hostility to the MacDonnells may in fact have produced an alliance between the latter and the Savage family, and the war-making, {{on the side of}} the Ulster Gaels, against the English of Ulster, including the Savages, by a certain MacGion, likely the Mac Eoin Bissett, in 1403 may be associated with MacDonnell's new style as recognised by Henry IV. Also notable is that a member of the Savage family, the seneschal of Ulster Richard Savage, had the wardship of Margery, as well as her sister Elizabeth, following the late Mac Eoin's death, and this included some control over whatever for certain their actual inheritances may have been, but it is unknown what exactly this may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the marriage to MacDonnell or if any possible alliance may have been influential.|$|E
