40|$|Summary. The {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} potential use of scal incentives as a mechanism for stimulating urban renewal has been highlighted {{by a number of}} in uential policy sources. This paper assesses the application and outcomes of tax-based incentives in urban regeneration, with particular focus upon the differing models represented by Dublin (Ireland) and Chicago (USA). Issues considered include utilisation of tax incentives, <b>drawing-down</b> of bene ts, role of actor groups, ability to lever private-sector nance, impact on property market performance and wider economic in uences. Conclusions advance the case for tax-based mechanisms as an instrument in the delivery of urban regeneration but stress the need for complementary structures to exploit fully the scal incentives...|$|E
40|$|In the {{sequential}} {{drawing of}} metallic wires from an initial diameter of 196 mils (4. 9 mm) {{to a final}} diameter just under 1 mil (25 Î¼m), the wires sometimes break. Subsequent examination via TEM of broken Al wires [1] revealed that breaks occurred most often due to inclusions of Si almost {{as large as the}} wire diameter. The challenge is to devise a technique that can detect inclusions well before the wire is drawn to about the diameter of the inclusions. For example, if there is a larger diameter wire that has commercial use, and some inclusions are detected at that diameter, then the <b>drawing-down</b> process could be stopped at that point, and only the wires without inclusions will be drawn to smaller diameters. A different problem occurs in the manufacture of composite superconducting wires, most typically multifilament NbTi in a Cu matrix. Here the sausaging of NbTi filaments causes a reduced critical current. For this case the challenge is to devise a]nondestructive method at room temperature for determining the integrity and quality of the NbTi filaments during or immediately after the fabrication process...|$|E
