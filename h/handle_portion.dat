40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a pilot ladder designed as to facilitate embarking to and disembarking from a ship from/to a pilot boat in safety conditions, also in rough seas. The ladder has modified steps and represents a noticeable improvement {{in respect of}} the performances of the conventional ladders. The improvement being obtained by realizing a <b>handle</b> <b>portion</b> in the central region of the step which enables the user to grip the step and to have more movement freedom and to maintain a more balanced condition particularly {{when he has to}} turn in order to descend from the ladder. The <b>handle</b> <b>portion</b> is formed by realizing a slot (33) in the central region of the step; in particular, the handle to be easily grasped is formed by the region (27) existing between the slot and the step edge facing the people who is passing from a craft to another craft. The decrease in the resistant cross section of the step {{as a consequence of the}} slot can be largely compensated by a greater thickness in the region (28) existing between the slot and the step edge contacting the flank of the craft...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{encompasses}} {{an experimental}} research study done {{as part of}} an honors program. The study aims to explore infants' knowledge of the handles of tools by examining their grasping and anticipation behaviors. Infants must learn how to use many tools in order to engage in a variety of daily tasks. An unpublished pilot study in our lab suggests that 6. 5 to 8. 5 -month-old infants fixated more on the handle of a familiar tool than 3 - to 5 -month-olds (Hirtle, Strouse, Borten, & Needham, 2007). The current study aimed to extend this prior research by also obtaining measures of infants’ grasping behaviors on tools. Infants were more likely to make anticipations of the hand reaching for the handle of the peeler than the handle of the spoon, and {{were also more likely to}} make anticipations of the hand reaching for the usable portion of the spoon than the <b>handle</b> <b>portion</b> of the spoon. The only reliable predictor of infants’ first grasp location on the tools was age, with 12. 5 -month-olds more reliably grasping the handle of an adult spoon. Results are discussed in terms of the experiences they have had with these tools and how they interpret those experiences.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{influence}} of three primary treatment alternatives for the retrofit of a large sewage treatment plant in Flanders, Belgium. (i) Raw sewage (i. e. : no primary treatment), primary clarification (ii) with and (iii) without prefermentation of the primary sludge, are considered. For each alternative, the associated energy and mass balances in each individual process unit in the liquid and solids <b>handling</b> <b>portions</b> of the system were identified and quantified by a comprehensive dynamic modelling exercise. For this purpose, {{the results of an}} in- and off-line influent and sludge characterisation campaign, in combination with fermentation and anaerobic digestion batch tests, were used as primary data. The interpretation of the simulation results identified the combination of primary clarifiers and anaerobic digestion of the excess sludge as having the least potential impact on the environment and the most advantages in terms of transportation and provision of integral power generation. The principal advantage of prefermentation is its capability to divert the energy to the liquid or to the solids treatment, according to the actual necessities of the process. The results were used for decisions on investment. The upgrading is scheduled for 2003...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Binary {{rewriting}} is {{the process}} of transforming executables by maintaining the original binary’s functionality, while improving it in one or more metrics, such as energy use, memory use, security, or reliability. Although several technologies for rewriting binaries exist, static rewriting allows for arbitrarily complex transformations to be performed. Other technologies, such as dynamic or minimally-invasive rewriting, are limited in their transformation ability. We have designed the first static binary rewriter that guar-antees 100 % code coverage without the need for relocation or symbolic information. A key challenge in static rewriting is content classification (i. e. deciding what portion of the code segment is code versus data). Our contributions are (i) <b>handling</b> <b>portions</b> of the code segment with uncertain classification by using speculative disassembly in case it was code, and retaining the original binary in case it was data; (ii) drastically limiting the number of possible speculative sequences using a new technique called binary characterization; and (iii) avoiding the need for relocation or symbolic information by using call translation at usage points of code pointers (i. e. indirect control transfers), rather than changing addresses at address creation points. Extensive evaluation using stripped binaries for the entire SPEC 2006 benchmark suite (with over 1. 9 million lines of code) demonstrates the robustness of the scheme. I...|$|R
