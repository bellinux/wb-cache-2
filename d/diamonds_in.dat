5|$|Prior to Genesis, TNA held a thirty-minute pre-show. Two matches {{were held}} during the broadcast. The first pitted Shark Boy against Nigel McGuinness, lasting 5 minutes and 30 seconds. Shark Boy won the {{encounter}} {{by using a}} roll-up pin. The second was a Six Man Tag Team match between The <b>Diamonds</b> <b>in</b> the Rough (David Young, Elix Skipper, and Simon Diamond) and the team of Lance Hoyt and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens). The duration of the contest was 5 minutes and 48 seconds. The <b>Diamonds</b> <b>in</b> the Rough won after Skipper and Young crashed into Stevens simultaneously and followed with the pinfall.|$|E

5|$|They {{lose the}} <b>diamonds</b> <b>in</b> {{the plane crash}} and {{spend much of their}} time on the island searching for them. Paulo {{suspects}} they are the only reason for their relationship, and thus does not tell Nikki when he finds them on their thirty-third day after the crash. One day while looking in the jungle, they come across the , a scientific research station built in the early 1980s. Nikki is uninterested, but Paulo later returns by himself on his forty-ninth day on the island, hiding the <b>diamonds</b> <b>in</b> the toilet. While in the washroom, Paulo overhears two of the mysterious and dangerous island inhabitants known as the Others speak of capturing some of Paulo's fellow survivors; however, he keeps this information to himself.|$|E
5|$|So far (2009), {{there is}} only one {{reliable}} evidence (through hyperfine interaction structure in electron paramagnetic resonance) for isolated sulfur defects in diamond. The corresponding center called W31 has been observed in natural type-Ib <b>diamonds</b> <b>in</b> small concentrations (parts per million). It was assigned to a sulfur-vacancy complexâ€“ again, as in case of nickel and silicon, a semi-divacancy site.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Diamonds</b> <b>in</b> the Rough (Simon Diamond, David Young, and Elix Skipper) versus Apolo, Sonny Siaki, and Shark Boy in a Six Man Tag Team match followed.

5|$|Diamonds exhibit fluorescence, that is, they emit {{light of}} various colors and intensities under long-wave {{ultraviolet}} light (365nm): Cape series stones (type Ia) usually fluoresce blue, and these stones may also phosphoresce yellow, a unique property among gemstones. Other possible long-wave fluorescence colors are green (usually in brown stones), yellow, mauve, or red (in type IIb <b>diamonds).</b> <b>In</b> natural diamonds, there is typically {{little if any}} response to short-wave ultraviolet, but {{the reverse is true}} of synthetic diamonds. Some natural type IIb diamonds phosphoresce blue after exposure to short-wave ultraviolet. In natural diamonds, fluorescence under X-rays is generally bluish-white, yellowish or greenish. Some diamonds, particularly Canadian diamonds, show no fluorescence.|$|E

5|$|Rankine {{began his}} career with the Doncaster Rovers youth system, before playing for Armthorpe Welfare and Barrow in non-League football. He moved to League Two club Scunthorpe United in 2004 but after only scoring one goal for them he signed for Alfreton Town. He signed for Conference National club Rushden & <b>Diamonds</b> <b>in</b> 2006, where he played for three seasons, before signing for divisional rivals York City in 2009. He played for them in the 2010 Conference Premier {{play-off}} Final before signing for Aldershot Town in 2011. He spent two seasons at Aldershot and during that time had loan spells with Grimsby Town and York. After a season with Hereford United he signed for Gateshead in 2014.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} examine the adhesion and friction of single-crystal <b>diamond</b> <b>in</b> contact with various transition metals {{and the nature of}} metal transfer to diamond. Sliding friction experiments were conducted with <b>diamond</b> <b>in</b> sliding contact with the metals yttrium, titanium, zirconium, vanadium, iron, cobalt, nickel, tungsten, platinum, rhenium and rhodium. All experiments were conducted with loads of 0. 05 to 0. 3 N, at a sliding velocity of 0. 003 m per minute, in a vacuum of 10 to the - 8 th Pa, at room temperature, and on the (111) plane of <b>diamond</b> with sliding <b>in</b> the 110 line type direction. The results of the investigation indicate that the coefficient of friction for <b>diamond</b> <b>in</b> contact with various metals is related to the relative chemical activity of the metals in high vacuum. The more active the metal, the higher the coefficient of friction. All the metals examined transferred to the surface of <b>diamond</b> <b>in</b> sliding...|$|R

5|$|Silicon is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in diamond films grown by chemical vapor deposition and it originates either from silicon substrate or from silica windows or walls of the CVD reactor. It was also observed in natural <b>diamonds</b> <b>in</b> dispersed form. Isolated silicon defects have been detected in diamond lattice through the sharp optical absorption peak at 738nm and electron paramagnetic resonance. Similar to other large impurities, the major form of silicon in diamond has been identified with a Si-vacancy complex (semi-divacancy site). This center is a deep donor having an ionization energy of 2 eV, and thus again is unsuitable for electronic applications.|$|E
5|$|The {{competitors}} {{must decide}} how much to pay each agent, {{and how much to}} pay the local guide in that region. If there are competing offers for the same guide in a particular region, the highest offer receives all of that region's <b>diamonds</b> <b>in</b> an all-pay auction. Competing agents can be bribed to reveal inside information regarding the competitor's decisions. Complicating matters further is the UN inspector, who moves at random between regions on each turn. The inspector blocks all diamond extraction from the region in which he is present, and can confiscate diamonds from agents within that region. Like other agents though, the inspector can be bribed and directed to regions of a player's choice.|$|E
5|$|The geology of the Riverina {{comprises}} several troughs and sedimentary basins. The western Riverina {{is presumed}} to be {{a continuation of the}} Ballarat and Bendigo geological zone while eastern sections are underlain by western portions of the Lachlan Fold Belt. There is potential for the Riverina to host several mineral deposit types including coal, petroleum, coal seam methane, gypsum, orogenic gold, Cobar style polymetallic systems, heavy mineral sands and possibly <b>diamonds</b> <b>in</b> these fold belt rocks and basins. Riverina soils are generally sandy along the river channels, with more saline grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas on the perimeter of the floodplain. As the Murrumbidgee passes downstream, the water and soil become more saline.|$|E

5|$|Beardsley played youth {{football}} with Mickleover Sports and Derby County {{before starting}} his senior career with Mansfield Town. He {{broke into the}} first team in December 2002, and spent a brief period on loan at Worksop Town in the 2003â€“04 season. He left Mansfield in June 2004 and joined Doncaster Rovers a month later. He failed to make an impact, and signed for Kidderminster Harriers in December 2004. He rejoined Mansfield in July 2005, but did not play regularly in his one-and-a-half-year stay, and was loaned out to Conference National club Rushden & <b>Diamonds</b> <b>in</b> January 2007. He signed for the club permanently later that month, but struggled for appearances after a change in management. Beardsley joined York City in June 2007, but suffered a broken jaw in a match against Grays Athletic, and failed to establish himself in the team. He joined Kettering Town in December 2007, initially on loan, and helped the club win promotion to the Conference Premier in 2007â€“08.|$|E
5|$|Goals in {{the opening}} 10 minutes from Brodie and Gash gave York a 2â€“0 home win over Crawley Town. A 0â€“0 draw away to Barrow followed, who had been beaten 6â€“1 by Rushden & <b>Diamonds</b> <b>in</b> their {{previous}} match. Two goals from Brodie, {{both of which were}} assisted by SangarÃ©, gave York 2â€“0 victory at home to Kettering Town. Simon Russell was loaned out to divisional rivals Tamworth, having failed to play any matches for York up to that point in 2009â€“10. Gash scored a header on 89 minutes to secure a 2â€“2 home draw with Cambridge United, after having given York the lead in the first half, before Cambridge scored two goals through Jai Reason and Mark Beesley. Goals from Brodie (2) and Gash gave York a 3â€“2 victory over Kidderminster. Chris Carruthers was signed from Oxford on a one-month loan to provide competition with Ferrell and Meredith on the left-hand side, while O'Hare was loaned out to Conference North club Gainsborough Trinity.|$|E

As a result, he had his boxing licence suspended for five months by the British Boxing Board of Control, despite the incident happening before he was under the BBBofC's jurisdiction. Woodhouse returned to football in November 2006, joining Rushden & <b>Diamonds</b> <b>in</b> the Conference National before moving to Mansfield Town in January 2009. After leaving them, he moved to Harrogate Town. At the end of February 2010, he joined Sheffield in the Northern Premier League. Before {{the start of the}} 2011â€“12 football season, he moved up two divisions in the football league system when he joined Conference North outfit Eastwood Town.|$|E
