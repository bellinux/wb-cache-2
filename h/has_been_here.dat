25|$|When {{there is}} a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as {{something}} new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, {{this is not the}} case. The female sangha <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are there, and we are simply re-energizing them.|$|E

The Evening Independent praised the film, lauding it as [...] "one of the cleverest and most interesting pictures that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> this season".|$|E

500|$|Later in his reign, Ernest's actions {{managed to}} {{continually}} anger his sister-in-law. Though Victoria loved Ernest {{because he was}} Albert's brother, she was displeased that Ernest was writing his memoirs, worrying about their contents mainly in regard to her dead husband. Despite their disputes, Ernest still met with Victoria and her family occasionally. In 1891, they met in France; Victoria's lady-in-waiting commented [...] "the old Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> today with his wife. He is the Prince Consort's only brother and an awful looking man, the Queen dislikes him particularly. He is always writing anonymous pamphlets against the Queen and the Empress Frederick, which naturally creates {{a great deal of}} annoyance in the family".|$|E
500|$|Dein {{described}} Wenger as {{the most}} important manager in the club's history: [...] "Arsène's a miracle worker. He's revolutionised the club. He's turned players into world-class players. Since he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>here,</b> we have seen football from another planet". Former Watford manager Graham Taylor said of Wenger in 2002: [...] "I believe his biggest contribution to football is getting across the idea that players have to prepare right and look after themselves". Wenger's loyalty towards financial fair play and handling of Arsenal's debt since their stadium move has earnt him praise, not least from American baseball general manager Billy Beane, who in particular lauded his transfer strategy. A survey in 2007 found Wenger was the only Premier League manager to have made a profit on transfers, and between 2004 and 2009, he made an average profit of £4.4million per season on transfers, far more than any other club.|$|E

500|$|During {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Edwards was key in Accrington's strong {{defensive}} record, with the team conceding just one goal in their first seven league fixtures. In October 2010, Edwards scored his first and second goals of the season when he scored twice from the penalty spot in Accrington's 7–4 home win against Gillingham. He scored his third goal of the 2010–11 season in a 4–2 home defeat to Cheltenham Town, scoring a penalty in the 88th minute, only serving as a consolation with Accrington 4–1 down at the time. Three days later, on 2 November 2010, Edwards scored from the penalty spot again, this time in a 5–2 away defeat at eventual champions Chesterfield. His fifth goal of the season came courtesy of a 21st-minute penalty in a 1–1 draw at Bradford City, before he scored another goal at Morecambe in a 2–1 away win on 1 January 2011. A month later, on 1 February, Edwards scored yet again against Morecambe, this time in a 1–1 home draw, salvaging a point by scoring a late penalty. His eighth goal of the campaign came three weeks later, scoring a header from Charlie Barnett's cross in the 82nd minute to give Accrington a 2–1 away win at Wycombe, their first win in five league matches. Edwards took his goal tally into double figures when he scored two first-half penalties in a 3–0 home win against Stockport County on 8 March 2011. He missed a penalty in a 3–1 defeat at Gillingham four days later, before scoring three days later in a 3–1 home win against Burton Albion — scoring from six yards out following good work from Terry Gornell. He scored his twelfth goal of the season with an 82nd-minute penalty in a 3–1 win against Southend United on 5 April 2011, moving Accrington into the play-off places in League Two. Three days later, Edwards scored again from the penalty spot, scoring a 79th-minute penalty to give Accrington the lead against ten man Macclesfield Town, although a late goal courtesy of Vinny Mukendi earned Macclesfield a point. Accrington cemented a place in the League Two play-offs after finishing fifth, Edwards played in both of the semi-final matches against Stevenage, which Accrington lost by a 3–0 aggregate scoreline. Edwards scored a total of 13 goals from defence in 51 appearances during Accrington's 2010–11 campaign, finishing as Accrington's joint top goalscorer for the season alongside Terry Gornell and Sean McConville. He was offered a two-year contract extension {{at the end of the}} season. Accrington assistant manager Jimmy Bell stated [...] "Phil has been offered a good deal and we're quietly confident, although there have been a few rumours about one or two clubs being interested. But Phil <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> since he was young, he can't drive, he gets looked after by the club and he gets lifts in to training, so he feels quite settled here". Edwards played 257 games for Accrington, scoring 24 goals.|$|E

Finally, Kennedy warned of the risks of [...] "a subsequent assimilation within the Conservative fold", adding: [...] "David Cameron <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> often before: from the early days of his leadership he was happy to describe himself as a 'liberal Conservative'.

2500|$|Endorsing {{the book}} Lokayata Joseph Needham wrote: [...] "Your book {{will have a}} truly treasured place on my shelves. It is truly {{extraordinary}} {{that we should have}} approached ancient Chinese and ancient Indian civilisations with such similar results...." [...] About Chattopadhayay's 1977 book, Science and Society in Ancient India, he said: [...] "I feel that you have entirely proved your case that the Caraka-samhita and the Susruta-samhita have an ambiguous character, which, when dissected, reveals the intense struggle between the theological philosophers on the one hand, and the doctors who strove for a truly scientific view of the world, on the other.

2500|$|David told Arthur {{they were}} going to restore Excalibur right this second and {{revealed}} that Emma was the Dark One and that Lancelot was back. David believed that he had brought the dagger to hand over, but Mary Margaret brought it to Lancelot to hide, who then took her to the place that he and Guinevere had discovered. Mary Margaret realized that she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> before in a vision where Emma pulled her heart out, but before they can carry out their plan a deranged Arthur arrived and pulled a sword on them and demanded Mary Margaret hand over the dagger. Arthur reveals that he was planning to use the Dagger to have Emma restore Excalibur, and then, he planned to kill Merlin with Excalibur and become the most powerful king in all the realms. Arthur then uses the dagger to try to command Emma to come to him, only to realize that he was fooled by Mary Margaret, as the dagger she gave him was a fake, and David was on to this plan all along. The threesome took Arthur to Granny’s Diner, where Guinevere arrived and uncuffed him. Aware that Guinevere was still under a spell, she broke Lancelot's heart by telling him that she loved Arthur. Arthur by the way, also had a plan up his armored sleeves, as Guinevere blow a kiss out the sands on David and Mary Margaret, then tossed Lancelot in jail, where he was joined by another cellmate, Merida. With Mary Margaret and David now under Arthur's powers, they went to Regina and deceived her, with Mary Margaret saying [...] "Making Excalibur whole is our best chance to help Emma." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> before. [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
