5|$|Logging, {{along with}} {{cultivation}} practices has devastated tree cover, causing severe environmental degradation in the country. Over 80percent of Sarawak's rainforest has been cleared. Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened {{by the loss}} of trees, and over 60percent of the Peninsular's forest have been cleared. With current rates of deforestation, the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020. Deforestation is a major problem for animals, fungi and plants, as the forest is cut to make room for plantations. Most remaining forest is found inside national parks. Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life. Illegal fishing is another major threat, with fishing methods such as <b>dynamite</b> <b>fishing</b> and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems. Leatherback turtle numbers have dropped 98percent since the 1950s. Hunting has also been an issue for some animals, with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals, from marine life to tigers. Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism.|$|E
25|$|Reductions in {{populations of}} C. mydas are {{recorded}} in every ocean ecosystem they inhabit, and the contributing {{factors that have}} led to their decline are all anthropogenic. The main threats are harvesting of eggs and individuals, bycatch in marine fisheries, and degradation of the marine and coastal habitats. The most common accidental threat is the entanglement in fishing equipment with the most harmful methods being drift netting, shrimp trawling, long-lining, and <b>dynamite</b> <b>fishing.</b> Many pieces of legislation now ban these practices in protected areas.|$|E
60|$|The {{night fell}} {{extraordinary}} dark, clouds {{coming up with}} sundown and overspreading all; not a star showed; there was only an end of a moon, and that not due before the small hours. Round the village, what with the lights and the fires in the open houses, and the torches of many fishers moving on the reef, it kept as gay as an illumination; but {{the sea and the}} mountains and woods were all clean gone. I suppose it might be eight o'clock when I took the road, laden like a donkey. First there was that Bible, a book as big as your head, which I had let myself in for by my own tomfoolery. Then there was my gun, and knife, and lantern, and patent matches, all necessary. And then there was the real plant of the affair in hand, a mortal weight of gunpowder, a pair of <b>dynamite</b> <b>fishing</b> bombs, and two or three pieces of slow match that I had hauled out of the tin cases and spliced together the best way I could; for the match was only trade stuff, and a man would be crazy that trusted it. Altogether, you see, I had the materials of a pretty good blow-up! Expense was nothing to me; I wanted that thing done right.|$|E

50|$|Afxentiou {{joined the}} National Organization of Cypriot Fighters (EOKA) where he soon became Second in Command, {{adjutant}} to EOKA leader George Grivas. He was originally assigned the regional {{command of the}} district of Famagusta which he knew well. It was Grigoris Afxentiou who first thought of obtaining explosives from the sea bed, in shallow waters {{off the coast of}} Famagusta, as used by local fishermen to <b>dynamite</b> <b>fish.</b> Explosives were made from the surplus shells dumped in the sea by the British Army at the end of Second World War. Afxentiou was well liked by his peers and it did not take long for General Grivas to promote him to Commander of the Kyrenia district.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the use of}} spearguns and <b>dynamite</b> for <b>fishing</b> {{was banned}} through efforts of local conservationists in the 1960s, the {{wildlife}} is unafraid of snorkelers and divers. Coral bleaching in 1998 has damaged most reefs, but some reefs show healthy recovery (e.g., Silhouette Island).|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{prevalence}} of homemade <b>dynamite,</b> blast <b>fishing</b> is a perennial problem in the region. In 1994, an Italian tourist was killed and another severely injured while diving when a local fisherman dropped his dynamite on top of them. As a result, the Flying Dog Beach Resort, established in the early 1990s, decided to cease its operation.|$|R
60|$|The {{situation}} was very unsatisfactory and perplexing. Sheldon played the {{difficult part of}} waiting and looking on, while his rival devoted himself energetically to reaching out and grasping at the fluttering prize. Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him. It had become quite elusive and intangible, {{now that he had}} tacitly severed diplomatic relations; but Sheldon sensed what he deemed a growing antagonism and promptly magnified it through the jealous lenses of his own lover's eyes. The other was an interloper. He did not belong to Berande, and now that he was well and strong again it was time for him to go. Instead of which, and despite the calling in of the mail steamer bound for Sydney, Tudor had settled himself down comfortably, resumed swimming, went <b>dynamiting</b> <b>fish</b> with Joan, spent hours with her hunting pigeons, trapping crocodiles, and at target practice with rifle and revolver.|$|R
6000|$|Outside {{of these}} rare glimpses, {{there was no}} telling how many might be lurking in the bush. There was no {{penetrating}} that primeval jungle with the eye. In the afternoon, Captain Jansen, Charmian, and I went <b>dynamiting</b> <b>fish.</b> Each one of the boat's crew carried a Lee-Enfield. [...] "Johnny," [...] the native recruiter, had a Winchester beside him at the steering sweep. We rowed in close to a portion of the shore that looked deserted. Here the boat was turned around and backed in; in case of attack, the boat would be ready to dash away. In all the time I was on Malaita I never saw a boat land bow on. In fact, the recruiting vessels use two boats--one to go in on the beach, armed, of course, and the other to lie off several hundred feet and [...] "cover" [...] the first boat. The Minota, however, being a small vessel, did not carry a covering boat.|$|R
50|$|Destructive fishing practices: These include cyanide fishing, blast or <b>dynamite</b> <b>fishing,</b> bottom trawling, and muro-ami (banging on {{the reef}} with sticks). Bottom-trawling {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} threats to cold-water coral reefs.|$|E
50|$|The {{aggressive}} anti-illegal fishing {{efforts of}} the LGU decreased <b>dynamite</b> <b>fishing</b> and able to establish fish sanctuaries in San Isidro waters. Most of the fishermen in this town used paddle-boat than motorized boat in fishing.|$|E

500|$|A {{self-described}} [...] "workaholic" [...] Bolt {{was considered}} by the other pilots {{to be the most}} energetic member of the squadron. He took to collecting and sending home keepsakes from daily life on the front lines; he and two other pilots were known as the [...] "Quartermaster Kids" [...] because they collected so many souvenirs and shipped them home. He could often be found in the harbor near their airstrip <b>dynamiting</b> <b>fish</b> and was known to organize many of the squadron's pig roasts and beer parties. Bolt also took it upon himself to test out many different ammunition configurations for the [...]50 caliber guns on the F4U during his free time. His research was conducted by firing rounds into 50-gallon drums partially filled with gasoline and at abandoned aircraft in the Espiritu Santo boneyard. He found that incendiary rounds were more effective, and convinced his squadron, and eventually most of the aircraft squadrons in the Pacific Theater, to begin firing six incendiary rounds for every one armor-piercing or tracer round, rather than firing one for one.|$|R
6000|$|The days passed, and Tudor seemed {{loath to}} leave the {{hospitality}} of Berande. Everything {{was ready for the}} start, but he lingered on, spending much time in Joan's company and thereby increasing the dislike Sheldon had taken to him. He went swimming with her, in point of rashness exceeding her; and <b>dynamited</b> <b>fish</b> with her, diving among the hungry ground-sharks and contesting with them for possession of the stunned prey, until he earned the approval of the whole Tahitian crew. Arahu challenged him to tear a fish from a shark's jaws, leaving half to the shark and bringing the other half himself to the surface; and Tudor performed the feat, a flip from the sandpaper hide of the astonished shark scraping several inches of skin from his shoulder. And Joan was delighted, while Sheldon, looking on, realized that here was the hero of her adventure-dreams coming true. She did not care for love, but he felt that if ever she did love it would be that sort of a man--"a man who exhibited," [...] was his way of putting it.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{its status}} as a marine {{protected}} area, these habitats are still threatened by human activities, including <b>dynamite</b> and cyanide <b>fishing</b> due to lack of political and financial support resulting to poor governance and enforcement.|$|R

50|$|In the 1980s, {{fishermen}} reaching Tubbataha {{increased in}} numbers {{with the advent}} in motorized bangkas, instead of the traditional sailboats. Fish had declined in other fishing grounds because of overfishing and soon Tubbataha became a fishing destination because of its abundant marine life. Many fishermen used destructive fishing techniques like cyanide and <b>dynamite</b> <b>fishing</b> to maximize their catch.|$|E
50|$|The shore from Labrador to San Fabian is {{characterized}} by a long grey-sand beach. Other well-known beaches are at Bolinao and San Fernando City. The waters of Lingayen Gulf are murky due to its sandy bottom. Coral reefs were all but destroyed by <b>dynamite</b> <b>fishing,</b> although efforts are made to restore some, especially inside the Hundred Islands National Park.|$|E
60|$|After {{many days}} on the schooner, and after beholding more land and islands {{than he had ever}} dreamed of, he was landed on New Georgia, and put to work in the field {{clearing}} jungle and cutting cane grass. For the first time he knew what work was. Even as a slave to Fanfoa he had not worked like this. And he did not like work. It was up at dawn and in at dark, on two meals a day. And the food was tiresome. For weeks at a time they were given nothing but sweet potatoes to eat, and {{for weeks at a time}} it would be nothing but rice. He cut out the cocoanut from the shells day after day; and for long days and weeks he fed the fires that smoked the copra, till his eyes got sore and he was set to felling trees. He was a good axe-man, and later he was put in the bridge-building gang. Once, he was punished by being put in the road-building gang. At times he served as boat's crew in the whale boats, when they brought in copra from distant beaches or when the white men went out to <b>dynamite</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|R
50|$|The obscure snakehead {{is being}} {{considered}} as an emerging aquaculture species in Africa. The fish is very fleshy, has few bones, and {{is high in}} protein. The obscure snakehead also has some medicinal properties when eaten especially during recuperation from serious illnesses and as a postnatal diet. Hardiness, rapid growth, tasty flesh, and commercial value of this species represent significant aquaculture potential. An issue of concern {{is the way the}} fish are harvested. The use of poison, fire, and <b>dynamite</b> as <b>fishing</b> tools, along with the improper netting of fish, are hurting the fish population, as well as those humans consuming the fish.|$|R
50|$|With restlessness comes mischief. Mild mischief, to be sure, but it {{took several}} forms—a vastly greater {{consumption}} of questionable liquor with all its unpleasant effects, an equally vast increase in the popularity of that expensive sport ‘two up’, systematic <b>dynamiting</b> of the <b>fish</b> out of the Orontes River which ran past 18 Battalion's camp some two miles away.|$|R
50|$|Unsustainable fishing {{methods are}} ways of {{catching}} wild fish {{that are not}} considered sustainable in the long term. This could be because they threaten the fish stock itself by overfishing, or because they threaten the environment the fish need to thrive. <b>Dynamite</b> <b>fishing,</b> electro-fishing, or fishing with poisons are examples of the latter, used in developing countries.|$|E
50|$|Many {{fishing and}} diving areas {{across the whole}} of South East Asia, already {{severely}} damaged from the impact of <b>dynamite</b> <b>fishing,</b> have been ruined or totally lost through cyanide fishing. Cyanide concentration slows photosynthesis in zooxanthellae, which results in coral reefs losing color; it also eliminates one of their major food sources. Even at very low doses, cyanide results in higher mortality levels among corals.|$|E
50|$|Blast fishing or <b>dynamite</b> <b>fishing</b> is the {{practice}} of using explosives to stun or kill schools of fish for easy collection. This often illegal practice can be extremely destructive to the surrounding ecosystem, as the explosion often destroys the underlying habitat (such as coral reefs) that supports the fish. The frequently improvised nature of the explosives used also means danger for the fishermen as well, with accidents and injuries.|$|E
50|$|Some of the cay's {{outcrops}} {{are visible}} on its western side. It has high salinity groundwater and vegetation {{is limited to}} beach type of plants. The corals around the island were mostly destroyed by <b>dynamite</b> and cyanide <b>fishing</b> methods. It is covered with grass and thick trees. Much of the fringing reef is above water at high tide. It supported a beacon in 1984. It also has guano deposits.|$|R
5000|$|When {{war broke}} out in Europe in 1939, {{shortages}} arose, and Lauri began making his lures from tree bark. During the war, his lure achieved some promotion. Dynamite was sometimes used to obtain fish, but Lauri said his lure would produce more fish. He and his friends had a contest, and he outfished what had been [...] "caught" [...] with <b>dynamite,</b> catching 78 <b>fish</b> in a few hours.|$|R
60|$|She {{sent her}} whale-boat {{down the coast}} twenty miles for limes and oranges, {{and wanted to know}} scathingly why said fruits had not long since been planted at Berande, while he was beneath {{contempt}} because there was no kitchen garden. Mummy apples, which he had regarded as weeds, under her guidance appeared as appetizing breakfast fruit, and, at dinner, were metamorphosed into puddings that elicited his unqualified admiration. Bananas, foraged from the bush, were served, cooked and raw, a dozen different ways, each one of which he declared was better than any other. She or her sailors <b>dynamited</b> <b>fish</b> daily, while the Balesuna natives were paid tobacco for bringing in oysters from the mangrove swamps. Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation. She taught the cook how to make yeast from the milk, that, in turn, raised light and airy bread. From the tip-top heart of the tree she concocted a delicious salad. From the milk and the meat of the nut she made various sauces and dressings, sweet and sour, that were served, according to preparation, with dishes that ranged from fish to pudding. She taught Sheldon the superiority of cocoanut cream over condensed cream, for use in coffee. From the old and sprouting nuts she took the solid, spongy centres and turned them into salads. Her forte seemed to be salads, and she astonished him with the deliciousness of a salad made from young bamboo shoots. Wild tomatoes, which had gone to seed or been remorselessly hoed out from the beginning of Berande, were foraged for salads, soups, and sauces. The chickens, which had always gone into the bush and hidden their eggs, were given laying-bins, and Joan went out herself to shoot wild duck and wild pigeons for the table.|$|R
50|$|The movie {{revolves}} around Inday (played by Villanueva), whose simple life takes {{a turn for}} the worse when her father dies in a <b>dynamite</b> <b>fishing</b> accident when she was still very young. Being the eldest child, Inday is forced to look for a job in Manila to help her family. She kills her employer when he rapes her, and she runs away from the crime scene out of fear.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the end of}} the war Hass {{lived and}} worked in the film studios of Universum Film AG in Babelsberg near Berlin to cut and finish his film about the {{expedition}} in the Aegean Sea. This 84 minute underwater film, Menschen unter Haien (Men among Sharks), was released in 1947. It shows marine life including wrasse, jellyfish, sponges, sea anemones and rays. Highlights are the <b>dynamite</b> <b>fishing</b> and interaction of divers with sharks.|$|E
50|$|The nearby fishing {{communities}} of Kunduchi, Unonio, and Msasani all {{appear to be}} heavily dependent on the resources in the reserves http://www.icran.org/SITES/doc/dmrs.pdf and resource over-exploitation is an increasing concern with local fishermen attributing a decline in fish catches over recent years {{to the use of}} small mesh nets and <b>dynamite</b> <b>fishing.</b> A decrease in the abundance of fish and coral health, and an increased amount of bleached and broken coral has been noted by divers.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've seen a few {{who claimed}} they {{understood}} niggers," [...] Captain Woodward retorted, [...] "and I always took notice {{that they were the}} first to be kai-kai'd (eaten). Look at the missionaries in New Guinea and the New Hebrides--the martyr isle of Erromanga and all the rest. Look at the Austrian expedition that was cut to pieces in the Solomons, in the bush of Guadalcanar. And look at the traders themselves, with a score of years' experience, making their brag that no nigger would ever get them, and whose heads to this day are ornamenting the rafters of the canoe houses. There was old Johnny Simons--twenty-six years on the raw edges of Melanesia, swore he knew the niggers like a book and that they'd never do for him, and he passed out at Marovo Lagoon, New Georgia, had his head sawed off by a black Mary (woman) and an old nigger with only one leg, having left the other leg in the mouth of a shark while diving for <b>dynamited</b> <b>fish.</b> There was Billy Watts, horrible reputation as a nigger killer, a man to scare the devil. I remember lying at Cape Little, New Ireland you know, when the niggers stole half a case of trade-tobacco--cost him about three dollars and a half. In retaliation he turned out, shot six niggers, smashed up their war canoes and burned two villages. And it was at Cape Little, four years afterward, that he was jumped along with fifty Buku boys he had with him fishing bêche-de-mer. In five minutes they were all dead, with the exception of three boys who got away in a canoe. Don't talk to me about understanding the nigger. The white man's mission is to farm the world, and it's a big enough job cut out for him. What time has he got left to understand niggers anyway?" ...|$|R
50|$|Aggie is wounded, but Box remains free. He {{witnesses}} the spectre of the ram's {{head again}} and meets Mrs Croup {{who has an}} intense and unhealthy interest in famous murderers. Mrs Croup assists him in reaching St Beads nunnery, where Aggie was raised. There Box discovers that Olympus Mons and his amber shirted thugs have arrived first and witnesses them murder several nuns while seeking Aggie. Box is discovered and taken prisoner. Mons and Pandora Box reveal that Aggie is descended from Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene and {{from a long line}} of descendants who have been raised to be perfect sacrifices. Mons conducts a séance to discover Aggie's whereabouts and gains a riddle in return. Box escapes with the aid of Mrs Croup who uses <b>dynamite</b> for <b>fishing.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Dynamite</b> or blast <b>fishing</b> is done {{easily and}} cheaply with {{dynamite}} or homemade bombs made from locally available materials. Fish {{are killed by}} the shock from the blast and are then skimmed from the surface or collected from the bottom. The explosions indiscriminately kill large numbers of fish and other marine organisms in the vicinity and can damage or destroy the physical environment. Explosions are particularly harmful to coral reefs. Blast fishing is also illegal in many waterways around the world.|$|R
