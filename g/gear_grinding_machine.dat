40|$|SUMMARY The paper {{sets out}} to {{describe}} how a servo mechanism may be applied to generative gear grinding machines and an appropriate specification is drawn up. The system involves separate motor drives to the two shafts, the angular positions of which are monitored with radial diffraction gratings. One of the signals is frequency divided to achieve the speed ratio between the two shafts, the resultant similar frequency signals being phase compared, any difference producing an error signal thus completing the servo loop. Hydraulic motors are used as prime movers. The transfer functions of the loop are developed and compared with measured open loop results. It is clearly shown that with the components at present available the loop cannot be made stable. The specification of more appropriate hardware is discussed and future work outlined, but the conclusion is reached that this system cannot be used for its primary purpose on a generative <b>gear</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{proportional}} modification {{parameters are}} useful for compensating the tooth form errors of spiral bevel gears. Based on the mathematical model for calculating the machine setting parameters {{and according to the}} relative position relationship between cutter and workpiece, the formulae for calculating the second-order proportional modification parameters for gears manufactured by spread blade method was deduced by the curvature and normal vector at calculation point. The proportional modification parameters can make the lengthwise curvature or profile curvature or lengthwise twist curvature of the concave and convex flank produce uniform change or difference change. The formulae is verified by experiment on CNC spiral bevel <b>gear</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> and M&M sigma 7 gear measuring center. Preface In order to ensure the transmission quality and realize interchangeability of spiral bevel gears, the practical tooth form should be equal to the theoretical tooth form approximately. The method listed in literature [1 - 8] for modifying tooth form errors is not effectual for gears manufactured by spread blade method. Literature [9] puts forward a new modification method based on proportional modification parameters and it can realize the modification of tooth form errors of the pinion generated by single side method. This method is also available for gears generated by spread blade method. However, the current machine settings summary only provides the proportional modification parameters for pinion. Consequently, in order to apply this modification method to modify the tooth form errors of gears generated by spread blade method, this paper will deduce the formulae for calculating the second-order proportional modification parameters based on mathematical model for calculating machine setting parameters and verify these formulae by experiment...|$|E

40|$|Industrial gears {{are often}} very expensive; they {{are large and}} {{manufactured}} in batches of small quantities, or even individually. Nevertheless, several industrial gears are prematurely discarded because of superficial damages, even if modern technologies and machine tools can completely repair these kinds of failures. For a long time, in fact, the repair of a gear {{was limited to the}} modification of the addendum modification coefficient (a. k. a. profile shift coefficient), while the modification of the pressure angle was usually impracticable, due to the axis limitations of the conventional gear machinery, where the pressure angle and the normal module are set by the tooling. Thus for each repair requiring that pressure angle variation, a gear tooling with the modified pressure angle should be used. In the past decade, the scenario has changed, thanks to the introduction of the - multi-axis CNC Machine Centers, - gear modules for CAD/CAM software, - evolution of CNC <b>Gear</b> <b>Grinding</b> <b>machines,</b> - development of new cutting tools able to machine parts with surface hardness higher than 60 HRC. The above has enabled the application of new types of modification for the refurbishment of superficially damaged gears. This paper presents a new approach to repair industrial gears by showing a case study where pressure angle modification is also considered, differently from the past repairing procedures that dealt only with the modification of the profile shift coefficient. A computer program has been developed to automatically determine the repair alternatives under two goals: minimize the stock removal or maximize gear tooth strength. It will also be shown that the refurbishment of industrial gears using these approaches can result in a 30 - 40 % savings, compared to the cost of a new part, without reducing gear strength. This paper will also show that the whole repair procedure can be carried out in no more than two weeks, depending on the gear size...|$|R
