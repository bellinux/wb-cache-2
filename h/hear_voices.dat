25|$|Auditory hallucinations, {{particularly}} {{experiences of}} hearing voices, {{are the most}} common and often prominent feature of psychosis. Hallucinated voices may talk about, or to, the person, and may involve several speakers with distinct personalities. Auditory hallucinations tend to be particularly distressing when they are derogatory, commanding or preoccupying. However, the experience of hearing voices need not always be a negative one. One research study has shown that the majority of people who <b>hear</b> <b>voices</b> are not in need of psychiatric help. The Hearing Voices Movement has subsequently been created to support voice hearers, regardless of whether they are considered to have a mental disorder or not.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} <b>Hearing</b> <b>Voices</b> Movement is {{a prominent}} mental health service-user/survivor movement that promotes {{the needs and}} perspectives of experts by experience in the phenomenon of <b>hearing</b> <b>voices</b> (auditory verbal hallucinations).

40|$|The {{meanings}} and causes of <b>hearing</b> <b>voices</b> that others cannot hear (auditory verbal hallucinations, in psychiatric parlance) have been debated {{for thousands of}} years. Voice-hearing has been both revered and condemned, understood as a symptom of disease {{as well as a}} source of otherworldly communication. Those <b>hearing</b> <b>voices</b> have been viewed as mystics, potential psychiatric patients or simply just people with unusual experiences, and have been beatified, esteemed or accepted, as well as drugged, burnt or gassed. This book travels from voice-hearing in the ancient world through to contemporary experience, examining how power, politics, gender, medicine and religion have shaped the meaning of <b>hearing</b> <b>voices.</b> Who <b>hears</b> <b>voices</b> today, what these voices are like and their potential impact are comprehensively examined. Cutting edge neuroscience is integrated with current psychological theories to consider what may cause voices and the future of research in voice-hearing is explored.

25|$|When Michel was sixteen, she {{experienced}} a seizure and {{was diagnosed with}} psychosis caused by temporal lobe epilepsy. She soon had depression and was treated at a psychiatric hospital. By {{the time she was}} twenty, she had become intolerant of various religious objects, and began to <b>hear</b> <b>voices.</b> Her condition worsened despite medication, and she became suicidal. Convinced she was possessed, her family appealed to a Catholic priest for an exorcism. While rejected at first, after much hesitation, two priests got permission from the local bishop in 1975. After her death, Michel's parents and the two priests were found guilty of negligent homicide, and were sentenced to six months in jail (reduced to three years of probation), and a fine. The Catholic church changed its position stating she was mentally ill, not possessed. The case has been cited {{as an example of a}} misidentified mental disorder, negligence, abuse and religious hysteria.|$|E
25|$|Another typical {{disorder}} where {{auditory hallucinations}} are very common is dissociative identity disorder. In schizophrenia voices are normally perceived coming {{from outside the}} person but in dissociative disorders they are perceived as originating from within the person, commenting in their head not behind their back. Differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and dissociative disorders is challenging due to many overlapping symptoms especially Schneiderian first rank symptoms such as hallucinations. However, many people not suffering from diagnosable mental illness may sometimes <b>hear</b> <b>voices</b> as well. One important example to consider when forming a differential diagnosis for a patient with paracusia is lateral temporal lobe epilepsy. Despite the tendency to associate hearing voices, or otherwise hallucinating, and psychosis with schizophrenia or other psychiatric illnesses, {{it is crucial to}} take into consideration that, even if a person does exhibit psychotic features, he/she does not necessarily suffer from a psychiatric disorder on its own. Disorders such as Wilson's disease, various endocrine diseases, numerous metabolic disturbances, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, porphyria, sarcoidosis, and many others can present with psychosis.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Hearing</b> <b>Voices</b> Movement regards {{itself and}} is {{regarded}} by others {{as being a}} post-psychiatric organisation.

50|$|Marius Anton Joannes Romme (born 17 January 1934, Amsterdam) is a Dutch psychiatrist. He is {{best known}} for his work on <b>hearing</b> <b>voices</b> (auditory hallucinations) and {{regarded}} as the founder and principal theorist for the <b>Hearing</b> <b>Voices</b> Movement.|$|R
500|$|The term {{schizophrenia}} {{is commonly}} misunderstood {{to mean that}} affected persons have a [...] "split personality". Although some people diagnosed with schizophrenia may <b>hear</b> <b>voices</b> and may experience the voices as distinct personalities, schizophrenia does not involve a person changing among distinct, multiple personalities; the confusion arises {{in part due to}} the literal interpretation of Bleuler's term [...] "schizophrenia" [...] (Bleuler originally associated schizophrenia with dissociation, and included split personality in his category of schizophrenia). Dissociative identity disorder (having a [...] "split personality") was also often misdiagnosed as schizophrenia based on the loose criteria in the DSM-II. The first known misuse of the term to mean [...] "split personality" [...] was in an article by the poet T. S. Eliot in 1933. Other scholars have traced earlier roots. [...] Rather, the term means a [...] "splitting of mental functions", reflecting the presentation of the illness.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{consumer}} slogans as song lyrics was also commented on by various sources. Critic Perry Gettelman interpreted them as meaning to [...] "signify {{the emptiness of}} modern, godless life". Kieran Keohane of York University stated that the slogans in [...] "Zooropa" [...] were to express an alienating form of interpellation, while J.D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun referred to the slogans as a parody of the economic hype used to pass the Maastricht Treaty, through the promising of impossibilities, such as [...] "Be a winner" [...] and [...] "Eat to get slimmer". English professor Kurt Koenigsberger of Case Western Reserve University stated that the consumer advertisements constitute Zooropa as a [...] "sardonically dystopic" [...] location. In the book Reading Rock and Roll, Robyn Brothers said that the song conveys a [...] "sense of confusion {{in the wake of}} a technology speeding beyond our control", while referencing the lyrics [...] "I <b>hear</b> <b>voices,</b> ridiculous voices / I'm in the slipstream". [...] Brothers also compared the song to [...] "Acrobat", stating both songs reference a response to uncertainty and an unavoidable feeling of alienation.|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was hugely {{successful}} upon its release on September 24, 1991. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard charts, {{and went on to}} sell thirteen million copies worldwide. The unexpected success instantly turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: [...] "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'" [...] Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was [...] "too high, too far, too soon. Everything seemed to be happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it." [...] He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to <b>hear</b> <b>voices</b> in his head telling him [...] "you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now." [...] Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism; however, [...] "by the age of twenty, I started doing it right and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls. To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star." [...] He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform, but left for California the next morning; according to the guitarist, [...] "it was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer. It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, but just the direction it was going." [...] He was replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.|$|E

2500|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Judgment Day 2006 {{involved}} Rey Mysterio and John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL) {{with the two}} battling over the World Heavyweight Championship. On the May 5 episode of SmackDown!, after Rey Mysterio expressed his feelings about being World Heavyweight Champion, John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield came out and declared himself the number-one contender. JBL immediately began degrading Mysterio because of his Mexican heritage, saying he was an illegal immigrant and that Mysterio doesn’t deserve to be champion. Mysterio reacted by saying that he'd fight anyone at any time. In turn, JBL announced that Mysterio would face off against Mark Henry later that night. During the match, Mysterio tried to use his quickness to avoid Henry, but was easily countered by Henry's power. Mysterio was able to hit a 619 and a Seated senton, but was defeated when Henry hit the World's Strongest Slam for the pin. The next week on SmackDown!, JBL announced that Mysterio would take on The Great Khali later that night. During the match, Mysterio attempted a springboard dropkick, but it had no effect. Khali then picked up Mysterio and hit a Two-handed chokeslam for the win. On the May 19 episode of SmackDown!, JBL said that Mysterio didn't look so well due to the beatings he endured in past weeks and that he probably didn't even know what day it was. Mysterio answered and told him the day, May 19. Kane, who in recent weeks attacked anyone who said May 19, came out and faced off against Mysterio.
