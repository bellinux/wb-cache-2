Harrison commented on gardening {{as a form of}} escapism: [...] "Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>garden,</b> but the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'" [...] His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated [...] "to gardeners everywhere". The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: [...] "George is not disowning the Beatles... but {{it was a long time}} ago and actually a short part of his life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Such a fruit {{as the one}} {{shown in}} the {{illustration}} grew one year ago <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>garden,</b> and I hope to grow more of those. This fruit is pointed above and has at the top a small long distaff (- the pitom); {{it has a very}} pleasant smell, very like that of the Florentine citron described below. It contains very little juice and tastes somewhat sour and also somewhat bitter. As it seems, this plant thrives better in pots, than standing in the ground, for this tree of mine has remained very short in height, and its branches have not overgrown the [...] stalk.|$|E
2500|$|One day {{he asked}} me to do his portrait. I agreed with joy, all the more so because his head and his whole {{personality}} [...] {{seemed to me to be}} perfect models for emphasising the plastic elements I was trying to develop. His face with clearly demarcated surfaces that made up a passionate interplay of facets, his hair in dark masses projecting lightly in waves over his temples, his solidly constructed body - straightaway suggested to me equivalences, echoes , interpenetrations, rhythmic correspondences with the surrounding elements, fields, trees, houses. So I suggested painting him <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>garden,</b> where I found easily to hand an environment that was highly suitable for my model.|$|E
