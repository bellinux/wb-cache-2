FAO s Understanding and Using Market Information offers an overview of the risks and opportunities of different sources of market information. It discusses the role of media like the radio, newspapers and market information services, and how to interpret their information.

It explains how various costs between farmer and market can be calculated and what farmers can do to get the best price for their product.

40|$|APO&# 8217;s North American correspondent, Joanna Mareth, {{reports from}} Boston on what its {{promoters}} call &# 8220;the largest, most complex and technologically challenging highway project in American history&# 8221; [...] . IN THE 1950 s a hit song popularised {{the fate of}} a man named Charlie, doomed to ride forever the subway below this city. In those days patrons paid a fare when they got off the train; Boston Charlie, unaware of a recent fare increase, came up a nickel short on the 15 cent fare and thus was stuck. And so, every day at a quarter past two, his wife would go down to the station and pass a sandwich through an open window into the train. As the chorus reminds us: But did he ever return, no he never returned And his fate is still unlearned He may ride forever &# 8217;neath the streets of Boston He&# 8217;s the man who never returned. These days, Boston Charlie still exists, but he&# 8217;s behind the wheel of his car, perhaps trying fruitlessly to find his out to the airport from downtown. Boston, with its narrow, curvy streets and proclivity for reusing street names, has always followed the &# 8220;if you&# 8217;re not from here, screw you&# 8221; approach to traffic management, but {{in the last ten years}} navigating the city by car has become downright horrendous, for locals and visitors alike. The culprit is the Big Dig, the city&# 8217;s ambitious US$ 15 billion dollar highway project to replace a 1. 5 mile stretch of elevated eight-lane highway with a system of tunnels and bridges. The project is long overdue: the &# 8220;Green Monster&# 8221; (as the highway is known) is a hulking eyesore of rusting metal and concrete. It chokes out sunlight and cuts off both the waterfront and the North End, Boston&# 8217;s Little Italy. Trying to cross beneath it on foot is a panic-inducing experience. Driving it is no better: it&# 8217;s now so far over capacity that eight hours of gridlock a day is common. Almost from the day it was completed in 1959, an instalment of the federal government&# 8217;s ambitious interstate highway system that razed neighborhoods and jumpstarted white flight to the suburbs, Bostoners have been calling for its demolition. Since the project began fifteen years ago, construction has become such a permanent fixture of the cityscape that it&# 8217;s hard to imagine the day when it will end. But when the project is finally complete in 2004 or 2005, the sunken highway will free up a ribbon of 25 acres of prime downtown real estate and reunite the city with the harbor that spawned it. Most remarkably, zoning regulations stipulate that 75 percent of the land remain &# 8220;public open space&# 8221; [...] a ruling that fÃªtes Frederick Law Olmstead&# 8217;s vision of an &# 8220;emerald necklace&# 8221; of interlinking green spaces for the city. But beyond a vague notion that the newly-created park should be used to atone for sins of the past, there is currently little in the way of a plan for what to do with all that land. In Manhattan, a year after the twin towers came down, there are several completed proposals for the space and a steady supply of public dialogue about how to proceed. Fifteen years into the Big Dig, Boston has convened a few expert panels and public forums, but serious debate has been stymied by inertia at the city and state level. It&# 8217;s not clear yet who will pick a plan and oversee its development (currently the land is owned by the state of Massachusetts and administered by the state&# 8217;s Turnpike Authority, though it may be turned over to the city at some point), and who will pay for it. The governing body, or bodies, may be public, private, or more likely a combination of both. Recent plans have called for a trust, with some members appointed by the city and some by the state, but distrust between city and state here runs deep. In the absence of leadership, few bold design proposals have emerged. Meanwhile, plenty of questions remain. Should the park be a pastoral escape or a bustling swathe of cafes and chatter? Should it be treated as a single sliver or divided up into parcels? <b>How</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> housing, to alleviate the city&# 8217;s crunch and provide round-the-clock activity? Some people say it should be built up as much as possible, to cover the scar left by the highway. Ideas have emerged for a museum, a greenhouse, a skateboarding park, a window into the tunnel below, a hip-hop recording studio, a maritime fountain that ebbs and flows with the tide, and a dozen other ideas that spark the imagination. Though Boston&# 8217;s reclamation of so much prime real estate was born of less violent means than New York&# 8217;s, its outcome is hardly less symbolic. How Boston handles this historic moment will determine the future shape of the city for years to come and set a precedent for a new kind of American civic renewal that places people above cars (in this case, figuratively and literally). As architectural critic Robert Campbell said recently in a Boston Globe editorial, &# 8220;Only in the United States is it considered odd to make large public investments in the quality of urban life. &# 8221; Odd, but hopefully not futile. So far, most public relations has focused on what an engineering marvel this whole thing is. The theme over and over is &# 8220;They said it couldn&# 8217;t be done. &# 8221; The challenges aren&# 8217;t over. The Green Monster may be going, but what&# 8217;s left behind will matter more.

40|$|Communication has an {{important}} role in our life. According to Gartside communication is the art of sharing anything. In its vital sense it means a sharing of ideas and feelings in a mood mutual understanding (1986 : 1). Thus, people can cooperate with each other when they communicate just as they do in any other shared activity. Communication is usually defined as conversation, namely for sending and receiving message. If the message cannot be received it means that communication does not work well. In order to make communication run in harmony, the hearer should know the speaker’s aim. Moreover, everyday we adapt our conversation to different situations. Among our friends for instance, we can easily say something that would be seen discourteous among strangers and we avoid over formally with our friends. In both situations above we try to avoid making the hearer embarrassed and uncomfortable. People generally behave in accordance with their expectation concerning their public self-image or face wants to be respected. Face means public self- image of a person; it refers to the emotional and social sense of self that everyone has and expects everyone to recognize (Yule, 1996 : 60). Face has two aspects, positive and negative. An individual’s positive face is reflected in his or her desires to be liked, approved of, respected of and appreciated by others. While an individual’s negative face is reflected in the desire not be impeded or put upon, to have the freedom to act as one chooses (Thomas, 1995 : 169). Therefore, people in their relationship need to preserve both kinds of faces for themselves and the people they interact with the politeness utterances. According to Brown and Levinson (1987 : 65), certain kinds of acts intrinsically threaten face, namely those acts that by their nature run contrary to the face wants of the hearer and / or of the speaker. For example, the hearer’s positive face will damage when the speaker insulting the hearer, and also the vi hearer’s negative face will damage when the speaker order the hearer. It also could damage the speaker’s own positive and negative face for example, when the speaker admits that he has failed in his job and when the speaker offers help to the hearer. FTAs are acts that infringe on the hearer’s need to maintain his or her self- esteem and be respected, [URL] In order to avoid or minimize to reduce the possibility of damage to the hearer’s face or to the speaker’s own face, he or she may adopt certain strategies. Brown and Levinson sum up human politeness behavior in four strategies among them are the bald on record strategy, the positive politeness strategy, the negative politeness strategy, and bald off record strategy. For example: a. Put your jacket away. b. You must be hungry, it’s a long time since breakfast. <b>How</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> lunch? c. I just want to ask you if I could use your computer? d. It’s bit cold in here. The example (a) is the example of bald on-record strategy, it shows that the speaker does nothing to minimize threats to the hearer’s face. The example (b) is the positive politeness strategy. It shows that the speaker recognizes the hearer’s desire to be respected. It also confirms that the relationship is friendly and expresses group reprocity. The example (c) is negative politeness. It shows that the speaker actually recognizes the hearer’s face but it also shows that the speaker in someway imposes the hearer to borrow the computer. The last example (d) is bald off record strategy, the speaker is trying to avoid FTAs by asking the hearer to close the window. Instead the speaker expects the hearer to close the window. Considering the phenomena above, the speaker should be able to produce the appropriate politeness strategy for being considered as a polite person. Furthermore, the researcher is interested to analyze the politeness strategies based on Brown and Levinson’s politeness strategy in a film. The film entitled “In Good vii Company” has a good solid story of a middle-aged man dealing with both supporting his family and keeping his job (bordering on a mid-life crisis), and a young man dealing with a new job, being alone, and finding what he actually wants to {{do with the rest of}} his life. The story puts the situation most in a workplace, where the different statuses such as friend, client, boss or the superior interact as the result there are many politeness strategy employed in this movie. Since there are many employment of positive politeness strategy found in the dialogue in the film entitled “In Good Company”. The researcher tries to analyse them. To clarify the research background, the following example will give clear understanding about it. Alex Foreman : Dad, I’m not gonna be a professional tennis player. Dan Foreman : Well, look, sweetheart, being a writer is just as tough. (Taken from “In Good Company”) The example above shows that Dan as the speaker employs positive politeness strategy 4, namely uses in-group identity markers. Actually, Dan disagrees with Alex because he wants Alex to be a professional tennis player not a writer. Dan uses the word ‘sweetheart’ to address Alex in order to minimize the FTAs (advise). It is not only to consider the relative power or status difference between father and daughter to be small but also to soft the imperative by indicating that it is not a power back command. Thus, Alex positive face is saved because she has been appreciated by her father. In order to understand more about positive politeness strategy and what factors influence the characters to employ the politeness strategy, the researcher viii intends to conduct a research entitled An Analysis of Positive Politeness Strategy in the Film Entitled “In Good Company...|$|E

An important question framing the issue is how the relationship between the sovereign nation-state, its legal residents and the ‘illegal’ migrants is or should be constituted and what fundamental principles that should guide these relationships of power or disempowerment. Irregular migration stands as a huge contemporary challenge and our responses so far seem inadequate because they do not appear to stop irregular migration, and because they seem to bring us at odds with moral and human rights principles. In this thesis I will argue that we need to dramatically rethink our responses to borders and irregular migration and that the promotion of a human rights sensitive agenda can show us new ways to approach this critical issue...|$|R
