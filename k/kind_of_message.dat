Tour operator Ryan Hunt claimed that police swore at the patrons and threatened people for asking questions. [...] "The police created a dangerous situation.

Because Kaine was a relatively popular governor of a Southern state, there was media speculation {{that he was a}} potential nominee for vice president.

Parrish stated that One Life to Live did not contact RAINN before telling the 2008 Todd and Marty storyline, but that ABC agreed to air a rape-themed PSA in the near future. Parish spoke of her feelings about the pairing. [...] "There is nothing romantic about rape," [...] she said.

[...] Spiritual teachers, by their very nature, swim against the stream of conventional values and pursuits. They are not interested in acquiring and accumulating material wealth or in competing in the marketplace, or in pleasing egos. They are not even about morality. Typically, their message is of a radical nature, asking that we live consciously, inspect our motives, transcend our egoic passions, overcome our intellectual blindness, live peacefully with our fellow humans, and, finally, realize the deepest core of human nature, the Spirit. For those wishing to devote their time and energy to the pursuit of conventional life, this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> is revolutionary, subversive, and profoundly disturbing.". In his Encyclopedic Dictionary of Yoga (1990), Dr. Feuerstein writes that the importation of yoga to the West has raised questions as to the appropriateness of spiritual discipleship and the legitimacy of spiritual authority.|$|E

2500|$|A tense period {{followed}} as proponents {{and critics}} of the Act continued arguing their respective positions. Tensions {{came to a head}} on June 10, when a hearing into the Patriot Act by the House Committee on the Judiciary ended in furore. During the testimony on the reauthorization of the Act, Chairman James Sensenbrenner abruptly gavelled the proceedings to a close after Congressional Democrats and their witnesses launched into broad denunciations of the War on Terrorism and the condition of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. In frustration, Sensenbrenner declared, [...] "We ought to stick to the subject. The USA PATRIOT Act {{has nothing to do with}} Guantanamo Bay. The USA PATRIOT Act has nothing to do with enemy combatants. The USA PATRIOT Act has nothing to do with indefinite detentions." [...] He then gavelled the meeting to a close and walked out with the gavel. However Jerrold Nadler, a Democratic Congressman representing New York's 8th congressional district, and other witnesses continued speaking despite Sensenbrenner's departure, and C-SPAN cameras continued to roll after microphones in the hearing room had been turned off. According to The Washington Post, James J. Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, complained that the action taken by the Chairman was [...] "totally inappropriate [...] no mike on, and no record being kept" [...] and that [...] "I think as we are lecturing foreign governments about the conduct of their behavior with regard to opposition, I'm really troubled about what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> this is going to teach to other countries in the world about how they ought to conduct an open society that allows for an opposition with rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to {{helping with the}} Zeitschrift, Adorno {{was expected to be}} the Institute's liaison with Benjamin, who soon passed on to New York the study of Charles Baudelaire he hoped would serve as a model of the larger Arcades Project. In correspondence, the two men discussed the difference in their conceptions of the relationship between critique and artworks which had become manifest through Benjamin's [...] "The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility". At around the same time Adorno and Horkheimer began planning for a joint work on [...] "dialectical logic", which would later become Dialectic of Enlightenment. Alarmed by reports from Europe, where Adorno's parents suffered increasing discrimination and Benjamin was interned in Colombes, their joint study could entertain few delusions about its practical effects. [...] "In view of what is now threatening to engulf Europe," [...] Horkheimer wrote, [...] "our present work is essentially destined to pass things down through the night that is approaching: a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> in a bottle." [...] As Adorno continued his work in New York with radio talks on music and a lecture on Søren Kierkegaard's doctrine of love, Benjamin fled Paris and attempted to make an illegal border crossing. After learning that his Spanish visa was invalid and fearing deportation back to France, Benjamin took an overdose of morphine tablets. In light of recent events, the Institute set about formulating a theory of antisemitism and fascism. On one side were those who supported Franz Neumann's thesis according to which National Socialism was a form of [...] "monopoly capital"; on the other were those who supported Friedrich Pollock's [...] "state capitalist theory." [...] Horkheimer's contributions to this debate, {{in the form of the}} essays [...] "The Authoritarian State", [...] "The End of Reason", and [...] "The Jews and Europe" [...] served as a foundation for what he and Adorno planned to do in their book on dialectical logic.|$|E
