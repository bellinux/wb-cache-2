5000|$|On June 15, 2004, the {{translocation}} {{operation was}} initiated. DFO {{began trying to}} lure Luna into a <b>floating</b> <b>pen</b> in order to rehabilitate him {{in the same manner}} as Springer. As the operation got underway, the Mowachaht/Muchalaht and other First Nations who continued to oppose the capture, were present in two traditional canoes. They succeeded in leading Luna away from the pen several times. [...] The orca approached the First Nations canoes, and the surprised band members began interacting with him. What transpired thereafter is a matter of opinion. In any case, what is clear is that the distraction prevented the capture team from luring Luna into confinement, despite repeated attempts over the next several days.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1965, William Lechkobit found a 22-foot (6.7m) male orca in his {{floating}} salmon net {{that had}} drifted close to shore near Namu, British Columbia. The orca was sold for $8,000 to Edward [...] "Ted" [...] Griffin, {{owner of the}} Seattle Marine Aquarium, but it ultimately cost Griffin much more to transport the orca 450 miles in a <b>floating</b> <b>pen</b> to Seattle. [...] While in captivity, Namu could eat 400 pounds of salmon a day. [...] Namu was a popular attraction at the Seattle Marine Aquarium, and Griffin soon captured a female orca to be a companion for Namu. The female, named Shamu, was however soon leased and eventually sold to SeaWorld in San Diego. Namu survived just over one year in captivity and died in his pen on July 9, 1966.|$|E
40|$|Underwater sound {{consists}} of particle motion and sound pressure. Due to technical difficulties only sound pressure {{is measured in}} most sound impact studies on fish and invertebrates. However, sound pressure alone may not adequately reflect the actual acoustic stimulus, especially in tanks, basins and near-field conditions. To test the acoustic validity of different experimental settings, we measured particle motion (in velocity) and sound pressure soundscapes of two set-ups for sound impact studies on fish: an outdoor <b>floating</b> <b>pen</b> and an indoor basin. During sound exposure, there was a gradient in particle velocity {{as well as in}} the outdoor <b>floating</b> <b>pen</b> and a standing wave in the basin. The ratio between particle velocity and sound pressure was consistent in the <b>floating</b> <b>pen,</b> but not in the basin. These findings confirm the concerns about the acoustic validity and variability between particle motion and sound pressure in basins (and tanks). Therefore, we encourage researchers to measure both particle motion and sound pressure to gain insight in the actual acoustic stimulus, in order to better interpret and understand its effect on fish and aquatic invertebrates. </p...|$|E

40|$|At present, the {{fundamental}} frequencies of signals of most commercially available acoustic alarms to deter small cetaceans are below 20 kHz, {{but it is}} not well ascertained whether higher frequencies have a deterrent effect on bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Two captive bottlenose dolphins housed in a <b>floating</b> <b>pen</b> were subjected to a continuous pure tone at 50 kHz with a source level of 160 2 dB (re 1 Pa, rms). The behavioral responses of dolphins were judged by comparing surfacing distance relative to the sound source, number of surfacings, and number of echolocation clicks produced, during forty 15 min baseline periods with forty 15 min test periods (four sessions per day, 40 sessions in total). On all 10 study days, surfacing distance and the number of surfacings increased while click production decreased during broadcasts of test sound. The avoidance threshold sound pressure level for a continuous 50 kHz tone for the bottlenose dolphins, {{in the context of this}} study, was estimated to be 144 2 dB (re 1 Pa, rms). The results indicated that a continuous 50 kHz tonal signal can deter bottlenose dolphins from an area. 漏 2012 Acoustical Society of America...|$|E
40|$|Human activities, such as {{shipping}} and pile driving, produce {{substantial amounts of}} man-made noise underwater. The noise may negatively affect fish, causing physical injuries, hearing loss, physiological stress, acoustic masking and behavioural changes. Among these effects, behavioural changes are most problematic, but are understudied, especially under well-controlled field conditions. Moreover, man-made noise varies widely in terms of acoustic characteristics. The influence of temporal patterns of noise on the impacts is largely unknown. We exposed groups of European seabass to sound treatments of different temporal patterns, varying in intermittency, interval regularity and presence of amplitude 'ramp-up'. The study {{took place in a}} large octagonal <b>floating</b> <b>pen</b> (⌀ = ~ 12. 5 m) in Oosterschelde, a marine inlet in the Netherlands. We tracked the fish swimming trajectories with an acoustic 3 D telemetry system and looked into the behavioural changes and recovery. Upon noise exposure, the fish swam to greater depths in tighter shoals, similar to previous studies conducted in a basin. Moreover, the fish swam away from the noise source, suggesting avoidance behaviour. The different temporal patterns seemed to differ in their impact strengths although the results were not significant. These findings may carry important scientific and management implications...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{ultrasonic}} {{sounds in}} alarms for gillnets may be advantageous, but the deterring effects of ultrasound on porpoises {{are not well}} understood. Therefore a harbor porpoise in a large <b>floating</b> <b>pen</b> was subjected to a continuous 50 kHz pure tone with a source level of 122 +/- 3 dB (re 1 uPa, rms). When the test signal was switched on during test periods, the animal {{moved away from the}} sound source. Its respiration rate was similar to that during baseline periods, when the sound was switched off. The behavior of the porpoise was related to the sound pressure level distribution in the pen. The sound level at the animal’s average swimming location during the test periods was approximately 107 +/- 3 dB (re 1 uPa, rms). The avoidance threshold sound pressure level for a continuous 50 kHz pure tone for this porpoise, {{in the context of this}} study, is estimated to be 108 +/- 3 dB (re 1 uPa, rms). This study demonstrates that porpoises may be deterred from an area by high frequency sounds that are not typically audible to fish and pinnipeds and would be less likely masked by ambient noise...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to test the {{effectiveness}} of sounds in deterring harbor porpoises from nets and reducing porpoise bycatch in gill net fisheries, two harbor porpoises, kept in a large <b>floating</b> <b>pen</b> at Neeltje Jans, The Netherlands, were subjected to 3 different underwater sounds. The effect of each sound was judged by comparing the animals' behavior during a 15 -min test period with that during a 15 -min baseline period immediately before the test and a 15 -min recovery period immediately after the test. The effects of the alarms were quantified as {{the distance between the}} porpoises' surfacings and the alarm and the animals' respiration rates. Each alarm was tested in two positions in the pen. The behavior observed was related to the sound-pressure-level distribution in the pen. All three alarms: the standard Dukane alarm (a commercially available alarm with a regular pulse interval of 4. 3 sec used to deter dolphins from fishing nets), the random Dukane alarm (the same alarm with random pulse interval of between 2 and 30 sec), and the 'bird alarm' (a sound from a generator) resulted in increases in both the distance of the animals' surfacings from the alarms and their respiration rates. The standard Dukane alarm and the bird alarm were more effective than the random Dukane alarm in inducing the animals to swim away from the sound source...|$|E
40|$|Two harbor {{porpoises}} in a <b>floating</b> <b>pen</b> {{were subjected}} to five pure tone underwater signals of 70 or 120 kHz with different signal durations, amplitudes and duty cycles (% of time sound is produced). Some signals were continuous, others were intermittent (duty cycles varied between 8 % and 100 %). The effect of each signal was judged by comparing the animals¿ surfacing locations and number of surfacings (i. e. number of respirations) during test periods with those during baseline periods. In all cases, both porpoises {{moved away from the}} sound source, but the effect of the signals on respiration rates was negligible. Pulsed 70 kHz signals with a source level (SL) of 137 dB had a similar effect as a continuous 70 kHz signal with an SL of 148 dB (re 1 ¿Pa, rms). Also, a pulsed 70 kHz signal with an SL of 147 dB had a much stronger deterring effect than a continuous 70 kHz signal with a similar SL. For pulsed 70 kHz signals (2 s pulse duration, 4 s pulse interval, SL 147 dB re 1 ¿Pa, rms), the avoidance threshold sound pressure level (SPL), {{in the context of the}} present study, was estimated to be around 130 dB (re 1 ¿Pa, rms) for porpoise 064 and around 124 dB (re 1 ¿Pa, rms) for porpoise 047. This study shows that ultrasonic pingers (70 kHz) can deter harbor porpoises. Such ultrasonic pingers have the advantage that they do not have a ¿dinner bell¿ effect on pinnipeds, and probably have no, or less, effect on other marine fauna, which are often sensitive to low frequency sounds...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Bonefish (Albula spp.) are {{a popular}} target for {{recreational}} anglers practicing primarily catch-and-release (C&R). The effects of C&R on bonefish have been previously examined in subtropical regions of The Bahamas. However, {{it is unclear}} how these findings relate to larger bonefish, as well as those caught in warmer, tropical environments. Here we examined the effects of C&R on physiological stress and reflex im-pairment in bonefish in tropical Culebra, Puerto Rico. Bonefish (Albula vulpes; 56. 6 ± 5. 0 cm total length, mean ± SE) were angled with spinning or fly fishing gear and either handled entirely in the water without air exposure (n = 12) or exposed to air for 2 min to simulate an aerial hook removal and admiration period (n = 11). Upon capture, bonefish were assessed for the presence of five reflexes and held in <b>floating</b> net <b>pens</b> for 1 h prior to phlebotomy for quantification of physiological stress. Blood lactate and pH were correlated with fight time, but linear models showed air exposure and water tem-perature were better predictors of physiological stress. Compared to previous research using simulated angling events, larger bonefish in warmer water under true an-gling scenarios had similar physiological stress responses. Two minutes of air exposure caused signifi-cant reflex impairment, which is a strong predictor of post release behavioural impairment and mortality risk in this species. Air exposure should be avoided with bonefish, especially with larger fish and at warmer water temperatures to minimize negative impacts and ensure the sustainability of C&R bonefish angling...|$|R
40|$|Seabird {{mortality}} {{resulting from}} oil spills is generally assessed {{based on the}} number of birds lost at sea. Drift blocks we often employed to determine the loss at sea and because blocks do not sink, but seabird carcasses do, it is essential to determine accurate sinking rates of seabird carcasses to correctly interpret onshore drift block recoveries. To quantify sinking rates of seabird carcasses, to determine possible differences between oiled and unoiled birds, and to investigate the importance of scavenging, I conducted an experiment in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, with 54 intact, but previously frozen murres (Uria spp.), the most common victims in oil spills in the Northern Hemisphere. Birds were randomly assigned to clean, lightly oiled (25 % of body oiled) or heavily oiled (50 % body oiled) categories. Twelve birds of each oiling category were placed into a floating three-chambered wooden-framed pen. The remaining birds were placed in a mesh-screened pen on the wharf. After nine days, randomly assigned carcasses from the <b>floating</b> <b>pen</b> and all birds on land, were opened to simulate partial scavenging. After 19 days, all flesh and muscles were removed from remaining birds to simulate complete scavenging. Changes in the buoyancy of carcasses were determined daily by measuring the amount of added mass (in 5 g increments) necessary to sink them (Burger 1991, cited in Burger and Fry 1993). On average, carcasses remained afloat 8. 2 ± 1. 0 d (95 % C. I. 6. 2 - 10. 3), with no difference between oiled and unoiled, either floating or on land. Carcasses on land retained buoyancy significantly longer and only 1 carcass sank with the 24 d period. Buoyancy loss was best described by a logistic time-dependent function. When carcasses were scavenged, buoyancy loss increased exponentially. Based on these results, it appears that backwash and subsequent sinking of stranded carcasses is likely not a significant mechanism of carcasses removal from beaches. I recommend using a 10 - 14 d estimate for the length of time that murres and other auks remain afloat at sea, and to use a time-dependent logistic function to estimate the proportion of birds lost at sea. It appears that most estimates of seabird mortality due to spilled oil based on drift block experiments may be too low because onshore block recoveries relevant to seabird carcasses have been over-estimated...|$|E
40|$|Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) {{caught in}} {{recreational}} fisheries are commonly released, often with barotrauma after rapid decompression. Mouth-hooked, non-bleeding cod {{kept in a}} <b>floating</b> net <b>pen</b> showed mortalities ≥ 40 % when angled from > 50 m depth, likely because of cumulative stress from ongoing barotrauma and exposure to warm surface water. In a natural setting, however, cod {{have the opportunity to}} descend after release and are not restricted to the surface. In a follow-up study, 97. 8 % of similarly selected cod managed to dive following immediate release, whereas 2. 2 % were floaters. No mortality was observed for divers kept in cages, which were lowered to capture depth for 72 h. While the floaters would likely have died in a natural setting, no mortality was observed when they were recompressed and kept at capture depth for 72 h. The occurrence of swim bladder ruptures, swollen coelomic cavities, venous gas embolisms, and gas release around the anus was significantly influenced by capture depth (range 0 – 90 m). A supplementary radiology study showed inflated swim bladders in 87 % of the cod after 72 h, and most barotrauma signs had disappeared after 1 month. This study encourages investigation of survival potential for physoclistous species when high mortalities are assumed but undocumented. Matching natural post-release and containment environment is essential in the experimental setup, as failure to do so may bias survival estimates, particularly when a thermocline is present. Assuming minimal predation, short-term mortality of cod experiencing barotrauma is negligible if cod submerge quickly by themselves and are otherwise not substantially injured. Survival of floaters may be increased by forced recompression to capture depth. Sublethal and long-term impacts of barotrauma remain to be studied. To ensure that cod have sufficient energy to submerge, anglers are encouraged to avoid fighting the fish to exhaustion and to minimize handling before release...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} {{was used to}} study the effect of {{crowding}} and subsequent slipping from a purse seine on the mortality of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus L.). Mackerel were allowed to swim from a purse seine through a transfer channel into two identical large <b>floating</b> net-pens. One <b>pen</b> {{was used as a}} control and was left floating in the sea without further treatment. The other was used to simulate crowding and slipping. The volume of the pen was gradually decreased by hoisting the bottom of the pen using a crane until the fish started to show panic reactions, and this volume was maintained for 15 min (2006) or 10 min (2007). The volume was then allowed to return to normal and the net-pens were left to drift freely in the open sea for 3 – 6 days. Five repeat experiments were performed, all of which showed that crowding has a major effect on survival rates. In all five experiments, mortality was higher among the crowded fish (80 – 100 % mortality) than the controls (0. 1 – 46 % mortality), and the difference was significant (p = 0. 01). The experiments demonstrate that excessive crowding before slipping mackerel from purse seines should be avoided, if possible, in order to avoid massive fish kills...|$|R
