50|$|In a {{conventional}} steam locomotive, the 'gear ratio' is {{set by the}} size of the driving wheels. As a steam motor uses a <b>geared</b> <b>drive,</b> the <b>wheel</b> size can be reduced. This makes for a lighter and more compact chassis, particularly by reducing the unsprung weight of large wheels. Small wheels also allow the motor to be mounted on a bogie within a passenger coach to form a railcar, rather than the large wheels being the size of a locomotive.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject is}} the {{aircraft}} bevel gears, which {{are part of}} the drive systems of gas turbine engines and helicopter transmissions. The article deals with defect specifics of the aircraft conical gears with a circular tooth as compared to the conical <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> of general engineering. The finite element method has been used to find by calculation that the main reason for destruction of aircraft bevel gears is a resonant vibration excitation of the <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> rim due to its nodal diameter eigenvibrations happened to be within the operating range of the transmission rotation frequencies. A parametric finite element model has been developed. It allows us to investigate the impact of modification parameters of the <b>drive</b> side of <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> on the function of the kinematic transmission error at different values of transmitted torque. Using the method of main coordinates, a reduced dynamic model of the bevel gear has been developed to allow simulating the vibration intensity of bevel gears with various parameters of the working profile modification. Within the framework of evaluation test of the dynamic model, amplitude-frequency characteristics have been constructed for the main parameters of transmission oscillations, including vibrational stresses in the teeth space. It is found that modification parameters of the transmission drive side {{have a significant effect on}} the vibration intensity of the bevel gears in the entire operating range. The main factor affecting the vibration stress amplitude in the <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> is the amplitude of the kinematic error function with the corresponding torque transmitted. The obtained research results can be used when designing the new aircraft drives and modernizing the existing ones. As part of the further development, it is expected to create a technique for recording the damage accumulation in the conical gears, taking into account the typical flight profile of a gas turbine engine or a helicopter. </p...|$|R

50|$|This is a {{powerful}} horse mill for four horses; probably English ponies, as modern heavy horses were not yet fully bred in the 1830s. Each of the four heavy oak beams connecting the central axle to the four horse shafts runs from beside the axle to the under-surface of the main <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> and crosses the other three in a grid pattern between the axle and <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> thus supporting the <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> and creating a rigid structure at the same time. They project for many feet beyond the main <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> and require wooden stretchers to stabilise them. From the ends of these beams hang the horse shafts. The bottom ends of these shafts are quite low, which may indicate the use of ponies rather than early heavy horses.|$|R

One axis is an optical axis (A-A) along which a light beam emitted by a light source runs. The rotating movements of the mirror (4) are caused by two drive motors (1, 2), whereby the rotating movement of the mirror is transferred onto the optical axis (A-A) perpendicular to the standing axis (B-B) via a differential gear (5). The differential gear (5) has two intermeshing <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> (10, 11). The mirror (4) is arranged in a mirror holder (3) connected to a hollow shaft rotatable about the axis (B-B).

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} modern vibration signal-processing {{techniques for}} vehicle gearbox fault diagnosis, via the wavelet analysis and the Squared Envelope (SE) technique. The wavelet analysis {{is regarded as}} a powerful tool for the detection of sudden changes in non-stationary signals. The Squared Envelope (SE) technique has been extensively used for rolling bearing diagnostics. In the present work a scheme of using the Squared Envelope technique for early detection of gear tooth pit. The pitting defect is manufactured on the tooth side of a fifth speed gear on the intermediate shaft of a vehicle gearbox. The objective is to supplement the current techniques of gearbox fault diagnosis based on using the raw vibration and ordered signals. The test stand is equipped with three dynamometers; the input dynamometer serves as the internal combustion engine, the output dynamometers introduce the load on the flanges of output joint shafts. The gearbox used for experimental measurements is the type most commonly used in modern small to mid-sized passenger cars with transversely mounted powertrain and front wheel drive; a five-speed gearbox with final <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> and front <b>wheel</b> differential. The results show that the approaches methods are effective for detecting and diagnosing localized gear faults in early stage under different operation conditions, and are more sensitive and robust than current gear diagnostic techniques...|$|R

25|$|The chariots of Yan Su and Wu Deren {{appear to}} have used this type of mechanism. (See {{descriptions}} quoted from the Song Shi, above.) Apart from the presence of components in Wu Deren's vehicle to make it function as an odometer, there were only minor differences between them. In each chariot, the two main road wheels were attached to vertical <b>gear</b> <b>wheels.</b> A large horizontal <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> was linked (possibly via intermediate gearing) to the pointing doll, and was positioned so a diameter almost spanned {{the space between the}} uppermost points of the vertical <b>gear</b> <b>wheels.</b> When the chariot was moving straight ahead, there was no connection between these gears, but when the chariot turned, a small <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> was lowered into contact with the horizontal gear and one of the vertical gears, thus linking the doll to one of the road <b>wheels.</b> Two small <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> were available, one to connect the horizontal gear to each of the vertical ones. Of course, they were not used simultaneously. The small <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> were raised and lowered by an arrangement of weights, pulleys and cords which were attached to the pole to which the horses that pulled the chariot were harnessed. When the horses moved to one side or the other, in order to turn the chariot, the pole moved and the cords lowered the appropriate small <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> into its working position. When the horses returned to walking straight ahead, the small <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> was raised out of contact with the main horizontal and vertical gears. Thus the system functioned automatically. The mirror-symmetry of the vertical gears being linked by the small gears to the horizontal gear at diametrically opposite points caused the horizontal gear to rotate in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was linked to it, thus rotating the pointing doll in opposite directions when the chariot turned left and right.|$|R
