40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> {{on the foreign}} policy of the new member states of the European Union, using as case studies Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. It asks what the extent <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> <b>of</b> foreign policy is and whether {{and to what extent}} there has been divergence {{in the way in which}} the new member states have responded to the similar constraints and opportunities of the European integration. Insofar as divergence can be identified, a third research question asks why there is policy divergence. It argues that the governmental politics and the politics of national identity play a key role as mediating factors for the <b>Europeanization</b> <b>of</b> the system of policy making, the process of elite socialization and the conduct of foreign policy itself. Three critical international events are used as sub-case studies in order to assess the extent <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> <b>of</b> foreign policy of the CEE counties: the US-led war in Iraq in 2003, the NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia in 1999 and the Kosovo declaration of independence in 2008. The study’s findings suggest that the pressures <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> leads to convergence in some policy areas, but domestic factors such as governmental and national identity politics offer a more convincing explanation <b>of</b> divergence. Overall, <b>Europeanization</b> is uneven not only across issue-areas, but also across countries. The limits of convergence as an outcome <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> and the persistence of diversity are therefore best accounted for by the diversity of domestic factors.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the ongoing quest for a European public sphere understood as a structural transformation of national media debates. The process <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> has a vertical and a horizontal dimension: an increased focus on the EU {{as well as more}} attention for other European countries. A content analysis of quality newspapers in five EU member states covering a period of 20 years reveals common trends across different countries but no convergence over time. Four different patterns <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> can be identified: comprehensive Europeanization, segmented Europeanization, Europeanization aloof from the EU, a parochial public sphere.

40|$|From the introduction]. To {{say that}} Europeanization is an {{overused}} and controversial concept {{would be an}} understatement, yet a recent substantial increase in scholarly publications on the subject {{has done little to}} clarify this term. Scholars differ on the definition <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization,</b> the mechanisms through which it affects member states (and EU candidate countries), their politics, policies or institutions, as well as whether or not Europeanization leads to a conversion of policy outcomes. Especially lacking, in this plethora of research, are cross-national studies which capture Europeanization in a quantifiable way and estimate its impact while taking into account the alternative ways in which Europeanization works. This paper, building {{on a wide range of}} theoretical and case-studies research, represents one such attempt to measure the impact <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> on the economic policy of the now new EU member states from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The first section overviews the many definitions <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> and justifies the use of the term to denote change in institutions, policy or preferences as a result of the influence of the European Union. This section also elaborates on why scholars should expect Europeanization to be present in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) even before these countries acceded to the EU. The second section develops a model <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> to be applied to the CEE countries and summarizes seven propositions for how various factors affect the process <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> <b>of</b> public policy in the CEE. The third section examines, by examples and statistical analysis, the extent to which the EU – through various channels <b>of</b> the <b>Europeanization</b> process – affects economic policy in the CEE.

The latter can be of help in studying effects below the threshold of inter-ideal type changes. This leads us to summarizing four country studies on <b>Europeanization</b> <b>of</b> governance patterns in smaller European democracies, i. e., Austria, Denmark, Luxembourg and Sweden.

It puts forward that Europeanization is less likely in policy areas where conditionality is not firm and where coalitions between the losers of reform and strong institutional veto players undermine institutional capacity building.

40|$|The main aim of {{this article}} is to discuss the {{potential}} interlocking <b>of</b> democratization and <b>Europeanization</b> processes in party politics in Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the two “extremes” in former Yugoslavia. While Slovenia has already gained full membership of the EU and has experienced the Europeanization processes in various aspects of the political system and public policies, Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the status of “potential candidate state for EU accession”, is still facing deep challenges related to the processes <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization.</b> While Slovenia has already gone through the five steps <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> processes, Bosnia-Herzegovina is still stuck at the first step. Although at the very first stage Bosnia-Herzegovina followed the Slovenian pattern <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> <b>of</b> party politics that includes establishing incremental formal links between national political parties and European party federations, further Europeanization processes in Bosnia-Herzegovina above all demand a democratically consolidated party arena, that for political parties would not lead to pressure to adapt themselves in order to mobilize their voters along ethnic lines. All in all, the conducted analysis revealed the two investigated countries are very different for making direct comparisons; nonetheless there was a common Yugoslav tradition in the past. Bosnia-Herzegovina is a unique European state, due to its mixed ethnic structure and strong ethnic cleavages, and thus we cannot expect a Slovenian and consequently a Central and Eastern European pattern <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> processes, in Bosnian party politics...|$|R

40|$|Switzerland {{is usually}} seen as lying outside European {{developments}} and norms, {{due to its}} unusual domestic political structures and its detached external policies, {{to the extent that}} it is called a Sonderfall or special case. In fact it is somewhat less distinctive than is often thought and, moreover, it is very much subject to the processes <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization.</b> Thus the Swiss political system, when analysed closely, turns out to have many reflections of wider European norms. However, its external policies do seem to have been posited on keeping its distance from European and other international organizations. And, in recent years, Swiss uniqueness has faded and the country has been subject to the effects of trans-European political trends. Swiss domestic politics is now more like that in other countries and this is even true of the style of the main anti-European forces. Equally, its foreign policy has become increasingly dominated by European questions which now provide perhaps the crucial cleavage line.

40|$|Introduction]. In general {{this paper}} is {{concerned}} with issues relating to theoretical and empirical discussions regarding the conceptual nature <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> and European integration. Through an analysis of British financial services in terms of banking, investment and insurance directives, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP) the paper identifies both ‘situation’ and ‘process’ conceptualizations <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> and illustrates its close links {{with the idea of}} European integration. Initially, this paper provides a conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> and explains its relationship with European integration. Second, it provides an overview of changes to the British regulatory structure over the last 20 years. Third, the paper explains the role of interest group intermediation in the formulation of shared beliefs and preference up-loading to EU policy-making institutions. In this context, the paper identifies how the concept of a ‘competent authority’ was up-loaded to the EU and the how Britain interpreted the downloaded structure {{in the form of the}} FSA. In addition, the FSA is investigated in its role as a unitary ‘competent authority’ and its attempts at policy transfer in championing this model are explored. Indeed, this brings into question the differences between vertical and horizontal policy transfer and up-loading. Finally, an analysis of British financial services provides some insight into the affects <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> and European integration on the sector, as well as the affects the sector has had on Europeanization and European integration. Through an analysis of British financial services the study is able to track elements of European integration as well as up-loading and downloading examples <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization...</b>|$|R

Examining the degree <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> <b>of</b> public broadcaster news in Germany and the Netherlands in 2008 and 2011 this paper gauges the changes in terms of visibility of European issues and in terms of salience of items on European issues. Moreover it is analysed which news categories predominate, the tone of news items on European issues, and which explicit evaluations of European integration appear – and how these elements are affected by the euro-crisis. Finally, it is shown that although the <b>Europeanization</b> <b>of</b> public spheres increased as the euro-crisis developed, the EU was mostly portrayed negatively, focused predominantly on economic issues and political contestation was hardly visible...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope and}} extent <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> among {{the member states}} of the European Union is all too often exaggerated by {{scholars}} of European integration.

In {{stark contrast to the}} assumed success of these mechanisms in promoting Europeanization, recent studies have shown that, in the main, both domestic socio-economic as well as normative structures have proved resilient to this process. Through a compelling exploration of the relationship between European integration and Europeanization, this collection provides important insights into the disconnect between efforts to promote commonality and collective European identity and the ambivalent results <b>of</b> <b>Europeanization</b> at the socio-economic and normative structures of member states. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Shortly after Poland’s EU accession, the rights of gays and lesbians to organize, to exercise free speech, and to participate in public life became highly visible and contentious political issues. The controversy culminated in bans on Gay Pride Parades and public attacks on “homosexual propaganda ” by government politicians, despite censures from the European Parliament. These developments raise questions about the EU’s capacity to foster norms of tolerance and non-discrimination now that accession has weakened the tool of conditionality. Drawing on interviews conducted with LGBT activists and political elites in Warsaw in summer 2007, I use this breach of EU non-discrimination norms to explore the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>europeanization</b> in a postaccession world, placing particular emphasis on the possibility of a policy <b>of</b> <b>europeanization</b> through persuasion...|$|R
