At the same time breeders also have to be aware of new demands from both the environmental and consumer sector. Improvements in individual animal genetics therefore cannot be seen in isolation, but are an important part of a wider industry change. Improvement in the quality and quantity of animal performance data, enhancement of genetic evaluations and the structure of genetic selection indexes are needed to help achieve this goal whilst simultaneously maintain genetic-diversity. Methods to enable the incorporation of non-economic objectives into a breeding goal are being developed. Eventually carefully implemented genomic technologies may provide new solutions to this ever more complex breeding objective, where we are often faced with conflicting genetic desires of <b>animal</b> <b>output</b> vs. sustainability...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} designing farming systems for low input conditions. By focusing {{on the problem of}} feed (=resource) allocation in livestock systems it provides clues for the design of alternative agricultural systems and systems in general. Linear programming (LP) is used to examine system behaviour under conditions of varying feed resource qualities, for individual animal production levels that range from 0. 75 to 3. 00 times maintenance. Milk yield, animal numbers and amounts of feed offered or refused are measures of system performance in two hypothetical Cases representative for actual farming systems. Case 1 considers available feed as one aggregated resource, with an average nutritive value ranging from that of straw to that of high quality forage. It establishes the individual <b>animal</b> <b>output</b> level that is required to achieve maximum total system output from a given feed resource. In Case 2, animals of different production levels are allowed to select between two feed resources that, through proper definition of the their proportions on offer, on average represent the same feed quality scale as in Case 1. The possibility of selection, however, allows the nutritive value of the actual intake to differ from the average nutritive value of feed offered. Better feed and higher (potential) individual <b>animal</b> <b>output</b> tend to increase total system output in terms of milk, by reducing the number of animals. Nevertheless, the term 'damning objective' is introduced to express that high targets for subsystem output reduces total system output if subsystem requirements exceed resource availability. Moreover, heterogeneity of (feed) resources can increase system output by using more production units with lower individual output. The results are tested against farmers' practice and situations reported in literature. Implications for the design of sustainable systems and further research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports a}} {{first attempt to}} derive all the {{relevant}} information {{with respect to the}} structure of production of an industry using knowledge of only a profit function. Using estimates of a profit function for Canadian agriculture, a procedure to separate substitution and expansion effects for both inputs and outputs was implemented. Information concerning net input and output substitution and complementarity possibilities were obtained. The most important empirical results suggest that the hypothesis of nonjoint production of crop and <b>animal</b> <b>outputs</b> in Canadian agriculture cannot be rejected, and that hired and operator labor are complements rather than substitutes. Key words: expansion effects, joint production, profit function, substitution effects. The general {{purpose of this paper is}} to esti-mate a system of factor demand and output supply responses for Canadian agriculture using a multioutput profit function framework. In doing so, a new procedure which allows one to measure net substitution and expansion ef-fects using a profit function framework rath-er than a cost or revenue function is im-plemented. (See Sakai, Nagatani for discus-sions of substitution and expansion effects in production theory.) Other specific objectives of this paper are the following: (a) formally to test the hypothesis of nonjoint production (be-tween crops and <b>animal</b> <b>outputs)</b> in agriculture and (b) to verify empirically the appropriate-ness of the widely used hypothesis of perfect substitutability between hired labor and op-erator labor. Important advantages of using a profit func-tion approach in estimating multioutput pro-duction relations for price-taking firms are that, in contrast with the transformation, cost, and revenue function approaches, it is simpler to estimate, and no endogenous variables (output or input levels) need to be used as Ramon E.

40|$|This work {{provides}} {{evidence on}} the determinants, cost differentiation, and development of short-term marginal costs of dairy farms in important production regions of the European Union. The empirical study {{is based on the}} estimation of multi-input multi-output Symmetric Generalized McFadden cost functions using an unbalanced panel data set of the European Farm Accountancy Data Network. The results show considerable regional differences in the impact of the outputs, input prices, and fixed factors on marginal costs. Strong evidence can be found that marginal costs decrease over time and is further underlined by the development of derived regional aggregated short-term supply curves. Marginal cost elasticities and correlation coefficients validate the hypotheses that a high degree of farm specialization, large milk output, and low milk prices are associated with lower marginal costs. Furthermore, the marginal cost spread in the data sample is analyzed. We show that milk output, milk yield, herd size, labor input, and fodder production can be attributed to significant marginal cost differentiation of farms, whereas for crop and <b>animal</b> <b>output,</b> grassland, stock of other animals, and depreciation only minor differentiation can be found.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} model for the prediction of dry matter intake by lactating Holstein Friesian dairy cows. To estimate the model parameters, a calibration dataset was compiled with the data from 32 feeding experiments conducted at 9 different sites. The database contained weekly information on 1507 lactating Holstein Friesian dairy cows regarding their diet composition and feed analysis, together with their individual voluntary feed intake, milk yield (MY), milk composition, parity, days in lactation and days pregnant. Dry matter intake was predicted from feed and animal characteristics. The feed chemical composition and digestibility can be related to feed degradation, bulk volume, intake rate, palatability and other factors influencing feed intake. Therefore, the data of standard feed analysis were used to estimate the satiety value of numerous commonly used feeds and forages. The satiety value is the measure {{of the extent to which}} a feed limits intake. The cows' ability to process the intake-limiting satiety value-units is expressed as the feed intake capacity, which is predicted from parity, days in milk and days of pregnancy which are indicators of the size and physiological state of the cow. This study shows that feed intake can be predicted using a limited number of easy-to-measure inputs that are available on commercial farms, yet reasonably biologically sound.

40|$|International audienceModern rural {{policies}} that incorporate agricultural and environmental aims within the broader framework of sustainable rural development are being formulated {{to address the}} problem of declines in grassland biodiversity and the destruction of sensitive landscapes and habitats in Europe. Extensification is the process of reducing fertiliser inputs, management intensity and stocking rates, and is central to these sustainable rural policies. However, research in the Less Favoured Areas of Europe has been fragmented and highly variable reflecting the different uses and requirements of our upland areas. Information is needed to determine the nature and timescale of changes in such systems, and whether extensive management is sustainable in the long-term. This paper presents results from a range of grassland extensification experiments across Europe, mainly within the European Union, over the past 30 years that quantify the impacts on soil, plant and animal components of the system. All have the common theme of changing the focus of land management from solely the agricultural product to include a broader range of ecological and environmental objectives. Beneficial changes in biodiversity resulted from more extensive management treatments, but at the cost of reductions in total <b>animal</b> <b>output,</b> and in some cases a reduction in individual animal performance.

After a few years of traditional whale-hunting the industrialization of the activity was formalized with construction of factory, and whale oil and products were concentrated in the area of Boqueirão. The Fábrica da Baleia do Boqueirão (Whale Factory of Boqueirão), now a part of the Flores Museum, occupies an advantageous place in the area around the port of Boqueirão, with a ramp adapted to drag Sperm whales from the ocean.

Construction began in October 1941, and the machinery installed by March 1943. It is likely that the factory began operations in the summer of 1944, probably in the month of July.

Tropical pasture utilization examines the problems involved and explains how pastures may be managed to meet the requirements of both plants and animals for growth and replacement. The author, Professor L R Humphreys, has been involved for many years in extensive research of Tropical and Subtropical pastures. Following an overview of the livestock systems of the Tropics, the effects of grazing animals on the edaphic, biotic and climatic environment of the pasture are described. The response of the animals to the available pasture are discussed in terms of pasture attributes of nutritive value and sward structure, selectivity and grazing behaviour. Methods for attaining continuity of forage supply are also described. The distinctive pasture characteristics of the Tropics, together with features of the climatic environment, lead to options for management whose emphases are different from those encountered in the management of temperate pasture and these are developed in this book.
