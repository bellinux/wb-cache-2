30|$|Let us have {{a closer}} look on how an {{externally}} reported vulnerability in a shipped software version is fixed: First, an <b>external</b> <b>reporter</b> (e.g., customer or independent security researcher) contacts the security response team, which assigns a case manager. The case manager is responsible for driving the decision if a reported problem is a security vulnerability {{that needs to be}} fixed, and for ensuring that the confirmed vulnerability is fixed and that a patch is released. After vulnerability is confirmed, the case manager contacts the development team and often also a dedicated maintenance team (called IMS) to ensure that a fix is developed and back-ported to all necessary older releases (according to SAP’s support and maintenance contracts). The developed fixes are subject to a special security test by the security validation team and, moreover, the response teams reviews the SAP Security Note. If the technical fix as well as the resulting Security Note passes the quality checks, the Security Note is made available to customers individually and/or {{in the form of a}} support package (usually on the first Tuesday of a month). Support packages are functional updates that also contain the latest security notes.|$|E

Phosphinimines, R₃P=NSiMe₃, undergo hydrolysis to form the phosphiniminiumcation, R₃P=NH₂+, which forms the ion pair [R₃P=NH₂+][X-] in the presence of an anion. Preliminary studies show that in the presence of TcO₄-, Ph₃P=NSiMe₃ forms [Ph₃P=NH₂+][TcO₄-] and [Ph₃P=NH₂+] is selective for TcO₄- over other anions. Technetium- 99 is present as environmental contamination in the form of ⁹⁹TcO₄-, which is extremely mobile. Currently available methods to measure this contamination are time consuming and tedious. A method to preconcentrate and measure ⁹⁹Tc environmental contamination in a quick and efficient manner is needed. The selectivity of the phosphiniminium cation for TcO₄- may make phosphinimines suitable for such preconcentration and possibly for measurement. Several phosphinimines were synthesized and characterized for their stability and selectivity with ⁹⁹TcO₄-, including Ph₃P=NSiMe₃, (9 -anthracenyl) Ph₂P=NSiMe₃, (1 -napthyl) Ph₂P=NSiMe₃, and (p-COOMe) C₆H₄Ph₂P=NSiMe₃. (9 -anthracenyl) Ph₂P=NSiMe₃ and (1 -napthyl) Ph₂P=NSiMe₃ include possible reporter groups and (p-COOMe) C₆H₄Ph₂P=NSiMe₃ contains a linking moiety for incorporating reporter groups or attaching the phosphinimine to a polymer support. The use of internal and <b>external</b> <b>reporter</b> groups to generate a signal in the presence of TcO₄- is also investigated...|$|E

Here is presented the assessment made in the CHUV internal medicine department one year after the beginning of the institutional procedure which promotes an open process regarding communication and risk management. The department of internal medicine underlines the importance of feedback to the reporters, ensures the staff of regular follow-up concerning the measures being taken and offers to <b>external</b> <b>reporters</b> such as general practioners the possibility of using this reporting system too...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a research method successfully used to study intellectual capital (IC) and IC flows through a highly networked marketplace. Design/methodology/approach – The method integrates computer-assisted content analysis (CA) and multivariate statistics. The CA is performed on a large source of business and analyst reports. The method is successful in enabling the elements of IC to be related to firm performance, using 156 firms in the global information technology market as a testing ground. Findings – Computer-assisted CA techniques could be successfully used to analyse the larger samples of firms for IC attributes like human capital, internal capital and external or relational capital, than have previously been feasible using manual CA methods. Research limitations/implications – Several limitations of the method are identified and relate to the computer-assisted CA method used. First, the method relies on the existence of a large body of content, in this case business reports and articles, to create the indices for the IC attributes. A second limitation is that the IC attributes are constructed from public sources (i. e. they represent the view of <b>external</b> <b>reporters,</b> rather than internal to the organisation reporters). The method presented combines and extends the benefits of both qualitative and quantitative methods. The richer source of IC content for a larger sample of firms is made accessible through computer-assisted CA. The overall method enables insights to be explored in relating firm IC to firm performance in the market place. Originality/value – The integrated research method presented is the result of original research. The value to researchers is the opportunity it provides to study the IC/performance relationship across markets, rather than be limited to small sample or limited attribute studies. 19 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Bicistronic {{reporter}} assay {{systems have}} become a mainstay of molecular biology. While the assays themselves encompass {{a broad range of}} diverse and unrelated experimental protocols, the numerical data garnered from these experiments often have similar statistical properties. In general, a primary dataset measures the paired expression of two internally controlled reporter genes. The expression ratio of these two genes is then normalized to an <b>external</b> control <b>reporter.</b> The end result is a ‘ratio of ratios’ that is inherently sensitive to propagation of the error contributed by each of the respective numerical components. The statistical analysis of this data therefore requires careful handling in order to control for the propagation of error and its potentially misleading effects. A careful survey of the literature found no consistent method for the statistical analysis of data generated from these important and informative assay systems. In this report, we present a detailed statistical framework for the systematic analysis of data obtained from bicistronic reporter assay systems. Specifically, a dual luciferase reporter assay was employed to measure the efficiency of four programmed − 1 frameshift signals. These frameshift signals originate from the L-A virus, the SARS-associated Coronavirus and computationally identified frameshift signals from two Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes. Furthermore, these statistical methods were applied to prove that the effects of anisomycin on programmed − 1 frameshifting are statistically significant. A set of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, which can be used as templates for data generated by dual reporter assay systems, and an online tutorial are available at our website ([URL] These spreadsheets could be easily adapted to any bicistronic reporter assay system...|$|R
