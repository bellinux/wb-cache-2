25|$|Anemia and thrombocytopenia, {{when they}} occur, are {{improved}} with blood transfusion. Neutropenia (a decrease of the neutrophil granulocyte count below 0.5 x 109/litre) {{can be improved}} with synthetic <b>G-CSF</b> (granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, e.g., filgrastim, lenograstim).|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} of whether geriatrics (patients over 65) react the same as patients under 65 has not been sufficiently examined. [...] Coagulation issues and inflammation of atherosclerotic plaques are known to occur {{as a result of}} <b>G-CSF</b> injection. <b>G-CSF</b> has also been described to induce genetic changes in mononuclear cells of normal donors. There is evidence that myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) can be induced by GCSF in susceptible individuals.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous immune {{regulatory}} functions {{have been}} reported for the IL-17 family of cytokines, presumably due to their induction of many immune signaling molecules. [...] The most notable role of IL-17 is its involvement in inducing and mediating proinflammatory responses. [...] IL-17 is commonly associated with allergic responses. IL-17 induces the production of many other cytokines (such as IL-6, <b>G-CSF,</b> GM-CSF, IL-1β, TGF-β, TNF-α), chemokines (including IL-8, GRO-α, and MCP-1), and prostaglandins (e.g., PGE2) from many [...] cell types (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and macrophages). IL-17 acts with IL-22 (produced by T helper 17 cells) to induce expression of antimicrobial peptide by keratinocytes.|$|E
2500|$|Red {{and white}} blood cell {{production}} is regulated with great precision in healthy humans, {{and the production of}} leukocytes is rapidly increased during infection. The proliferation and self-renewal of these cells depend on growth factors. One of the key players in self-renewal and development of haematopoietic cells is stem cell factor (SCF), which binds to the c-kit receptor on the HSC. [...] Absence of SCF is lethal. There are other important glycoprotein growth factors which regulate the proliferation and maturation, such as interleukins IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-7. Other factors, termed colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), specifically stimulate the production of committed cells. Three CSFs are granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), granulocyte CSF (<b>G-CSF)</b> and macrophage CSF (M-CSF).|$|E
50|$|Filgrastim {{is a human}} {{granulocyte}} colony stimulating factor (<b>G-CSF)</b> {{produced by}} recombinant DNA technology. <b>G-CSF</b> regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow; endogenous <b>G-CSF</b> is a glycoprotein produced by monocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} that {{stability}} of the <b>G-CSF</b> mRNA is regulated by an RNA element called the <b>G-CSF</b> factor stem-loop destabilising element.|$|E
50|$|The <b>G-CSF</b> factor stem-loop destabilising element (SLDE) is an RNA element {{secreted}} by fibroblasts and endothelial {{cells in}} response to the inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha and by activated macrophages. The synthesis of <b>G-CSF</b> is regulated both transcriptionally and through control of mRNA stability. In unstimulated cells <b>G-CSF</b> mRNA is unstable but becomes stabilised {{in response to}} IL-1 or tumour necrosis factor alpha, and also in the case of monocytes and macrophages, in response to lipopolysaccharide. It is likely that the presence of the SLDE in the <b>G-CSF</b> mRNA contributes to the specificity of regulation of <b>G-CSF</b> mRNA and enhances the rate of shortening of the poly(A) tail.|$|E
50|$|In 1983-84 {{his group}} succeeded in {{identifying}} and purifying a human growth factor, <b>G-CSF,</b> that stimulates {{white blood cell}} production (neutrophils). In collaboration with Amgen, recombinant <b>G-CSF</b> (Neupogen) was developed and in 1987 the first clinical studies were begun at Memorial Sloan-Kettering in cancer patients and pediatric patients with a genetic form of neutropenia. <b>G-CSF</b> protected against chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, reducing hospitalization due to severe infections and permitting all patients to receive the optimal doses of chemotherapy. In breast cancer, a significant improvement in patient survival was achieved since <b>G-CSF</b> reduced inter-treatment time.|$|E

50|$|White blood cells: The G-CSF-receptor {{is present}} on {{precursor}} {{cells in the}} bone marrow, and, in response to stimulation by <b>G-CSF,</b> initiates proliferation and differentiation into mature granulocytes. <b>G-CSF</b> stimulates the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and function of neutrophil precursors and mature neutrophils. <b>G-CSF</b> regulates them using Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signal transduction pathway.|$|E
50|$|It is {{produced}} by recombinant DNA technology. The gene for human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is inserted into the genetic material of Escherichia coli. The <b>G-CSF</b> then produced by E. coli is different from <b>G-CSF</b> naturally made in humans.|$|E
50|$|A {{pilot study}} {{performed}} in 2015 suggests that systemic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (<b>G-CSF)</b> may promote increased wound healing {{in patients with}} dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. In this study seven patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa were treated daily with subcutaneous <b>G-CSF</b> for six days and then re-evaluated on the seventh day.

50|$|The {{granulocyte}} colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R) {{also known}} as CD114 (Cluster of Differentiation 114) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CSF3R gene. G-CSF-R is a cell-surface receptor for the {{granulocyte colony-stimulating factor}} (<b>G-CSF).</b> The <b>G-CSF</b> receptors belongs to a family of cytokine receptors known as the hematopoietin receptor family.The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor is present on precursor cells in the bone marrow, and, in response to stimulation by <b>G-CSF,</b> initiates cell proliferation and differentiation into mature neutrophilic granulocytes and macrophages.|$|E
