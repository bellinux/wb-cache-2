We find that reserve creation can produce win-win situations where aggregate biomass and the common license (lease) price increase. These situations arise in biological systems where dispersal processes are prevalent and the fishery prior to reserve creation is operating at effort levels in a neighborhood of open-access levels. We also illustrate that using strictly biological criteria for siting reserves (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>setting</b> aside the most biological productive areas) will likely induce the most vociferous objections from the fishing industry.

As a result of social changes in the community, their social distribution, frequency and their social meanings are currently changing. The ‘urban’ greetings are being extended to all kinds of new social spheres and are increasingly losing their negative or subculture connotations while the ‘village’ greetings are becoming restricted to a relatively small set of situations and kinds of interactions. Moreover, new kinds of greeting practices emerge to symbolically assert existing social distinctions and to mark newly emerging social realities...|$|E

Originally, the Tangaras that ran on the South Coast Line were different variations of T <b>sets</b> known as <b>G</b> <b>sets.</b> <b>G</b> <b>sets</b> differed from T sets in that they had reversible seats, toilets, fresh water dispensers and luggage racks.

40|$|Working {{with digital}} devices, we {{often do not}} focus on one task but switch {{back and forth between}} several tasks. Usually some of these tasks are only small {{secondary}} tasks. But in contrast to the analog world, where we can carry out such tasks in the periphery of our attention (e. g., drinking a cup of tea while being engaged in a conversation), digital devices normally force us to switch windows, context and thereby the center of our attention independent from the magnitude of the task. To improve multitasking with small tasks (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>setting</b> the IM state) I am taking a closer look at peripheral interaction, interaction that can be carried out in the periphery of our attention.

Methods: A computer-based preceptor teaching program was developed and made available online.

Additionally, a brief questionnaire collecting demographic data was administered. Results: A 60 -minute computer-based program was developed for teaching microskills (e. <b>g.</b> <b>setting</b> goals and expectations). The seven preceptors who participated in the focus group liked the program design and content.

40|$|Various {{applications}} {{for the purposes of}} event detection, localization, and monitoring can benefit from the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Wireless sensor networks are generally easy to deploy, with flexible topology and can support diversity of tasks thanks to the large variety of sensors that can be attached to the wireless sensor nodes. To guarantee the efficient operation of such a heterogeneous wireless sensor networks during its lifetime an appropriate management is necessary. Typically, there are three management tasks, namely monitoring, (re) configuration, and code updating. On the one hand, status information, such as battery state and node connectivity, of both the wireless sensor network and the sensor nodes has to be monitored. And on the other hand, sensor nodes have to be (re) configured, e. <b>g.,</b> <b>setting</b> the sensing interval. Most importantly, new applications have to be deployed as well as bug fixes have to be applied during the network lifetime.

Questions arise such as: Which parameter is adequate here to capture central tendency? Which reference distribution should the normalization be based on? In this paper 16 different normalization methods are evaluated. In a perception experiment using German read speech (prose and poetry), syllable prominence ratings were collected. From the rating data 16 complete “mirror” data-sets were computed according to the 16 methods. Each mirror data-set was correlated with the same set of measures from the underlying acoustic data, focusing on raw syllable duration which is seen as a rather straightforward acoustic aspect of syllable prominence.

Overall, my dissertation work {{has shown that}} bone health is affected in dystrophic mice secondary to the muscle disease (Chapter 3), and both prednisolone and physical inactivity accentuate these declines (Chapter 4). I identified two sets of low intensity, high frequency vibration parameters (45 Hz at 0. 6 g and 90 Hz at 0. 6 g) that initiated an osteogenic response in mdx mice. Further experiments were performed utilizing the 45 Hz and 0. 6 <b>g</b> <b>setting,</b> the results of which indicated that vibration was safe for dystrophic muscle (Chapters 5 and 6).

40|$|We {{document}} {{the importance of}} the choice of error measure (percentage vs. logarithmic errors) for the comparison of alternative valuation procedures. We demonstrate for several multiple valuation methods (averaging with the arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, median, geometric mean) that the ranking of valuation methods is largely a function of the error measure chosen. Percentage errors give a higher weight to relative overestimates than to underestimates, and all established multiple valuation methods exhibit a positive bias according to this measure. Percentage errors lead to consequences that are not intuitive: E. <b>g.</b> <b>setting</b> company values equal to their book values often becomes the best valuation method. Logarithmic errors give equal weight to relative overestimates and underestimates and avoid unwanted consequences. With logarithmic errors, median and geometric mean are unbiased while the arithmetic mean is biased upward as much as the harmonic mean is biased downward. Measuring the diversification discount with the arithmetic mean generates a discount about twice as large as with the geometric mean or the median, whereas the harmonic mean leads to a diversification premium.

Given the proliferation of life cycle thinking-based data modelling approaches, a review was conducted to detect where we stand in defining and framing life cycle thinking-based approaches and related data modelling approaches, what their key features are, and how mature they are. In addition, a scientific workshop was arranged to further discuss data modelling approaches and to screen how Environmental Footprint methodologies can be used to assess future-oriented scenarios.
