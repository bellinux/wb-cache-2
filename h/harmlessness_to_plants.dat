The high toxicity of this compound to several species of insects and its relative <b>harmlessness</b> <b>to</b> warm-blooded animals led to its rapid adoption and widespread use.

40|$|Abstract—The {{realization}} of enhanced efficiency light emit-ting diodes (LED) and the trend to lower costs of LED light-ing systems will facilitate their wider deployment in many applications. LED lighting {{system with the}} value-added functionality of optical wireless communication enables the deployment of a communication system with very little extra cost. Visible light communication (VLC) provides the mer-its of secure information exchange, <b>harmlessness</b> <b>to</b> human body, and excellent applicability in some radio-frequency (RF) restricted areas. In this work, we review some recent advances in VLC. We discuss the challenges faced by the VLC and some possible solutions.

30|$|Because the {{requirements}} for wireless data communication continually increase, the radio frequency spectrum is becoming congested. Hence, quests for alternative communication technologies {{have been carried out}} increasingly around the world. In recent years, visible light communication (VLC) has attracted the attention of researchers and has been considered as a promising technology for future wireless communications, especially indoor communications. VLC refers to short-range optical wireless communication using the visible light spectrum from 380 to 780  nm [1]. Compared to radio frequency (RF) technologies, VLC has many advantageous features such as high-speed transmission, visibility, high security, <b>harmlessness</b> <b>to</b> the human body, high tolerance to humidity, ubiquity, and an unlicensed frequency spectrum [2 – 4]. In 2011, VLC technology was standardized by the IEEE organization in the IEEE 802.15. 7 specification [5].|$|R

40|$|The {{probability}} that a teratogen, applied to a pregnant mammal, will produce malformations in the embryo depends on the agent, the dose, the species, the genetic constitution of mother and embryo, and the developmental stage of the embryo.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the successful generation, development {{and delivery of}} the Egyptian Bt biopesticide known as 'Agerin'. Two interlinked processes are identified. The first is the transfer of public research knowledge to the private sector, initiated and supported by a new institutional arrangement for patenting and transferring public research. The implications of these developments on biotechnology are examined. The second process is the incorporation of the biopesticide Agerin, the 'hard' innovation, into what {{is regarded as the}} 'soft' innovation process, the integrated pest management system (IPM). Through IPM, and within the public sector, optimum conditions for the application of Agerin were created and the product was delivered to farmers. Extension workers played key roles in selecting and demonstrating Agerin to early adopting farmers. The attributes of Agerin itself (its efficacy, and <b>harmlessness</b> <b>to</b> human health and the environment) added to its appeal. The complex interplay between public and private institutions also contributed to the development, transfer and adoption of the product.

Which of these are relatively negligible. and which are potentially dangerous? What do these symptoms of disaffection with the Enlightenment-based tradition portend, for science and culture in our time? Here I present a framework to deal with these questions. It is based on the proposition that belief in anti-science (or ‘alternative science’. ‘parascience’) is grounded in a penon’s functional worldview, and is one symptom of a long-standing struggle over the legitimacy of the authority of conventional science, as well as the concept of modernity within which science claims to be embedded.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-based approach for competitive analysis of manufacturing {{plants in the}} U. S. food processing industry. As part of this approach, plant competitiveness is measured using Operational Competitiveness Ratings Analysis (OCRA) [...] a new non-parametric method of computing relative inefficiency. Drivers of competitiveness are identified in terms of policies related <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> structure and infrastructure. Policies related <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> structure are those decisions that are related with "bricks and mortar" and have long term implications, such as decisions related <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> size and capacity. Policies related <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> infrastructure are decisions related to how the " bricks and mortar" are used. These policies are typically under the direct control of the operations managers and have a short-term orientation, such as decisions related to equipment, quality, inventory, workforce and confusion-engendering activities (e. g. new product introductions and product variety). The empirical analysis is based on detailed cross-sectional data on 20 processed food manufacturing <b>plants.</b> With respect <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> structure, {{the results suggest that}} small sized food processing plants are competitive, and both capacity underutilization and overutilization are detrimental <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> competitiveness. Among the significant results with respect <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> infrastructure, equipment maintenance, quality management programs, packaging supplies inventory, workforce training and product variety are positively associated with plant competitiveness. The results also suggest that introduction of new products disrupts plant operations, {{at least in the short}} run, and is negatively associated with plant competitiveness. ...|$|R

(Malvales: Malvaceae) ] simultaneously damaged by different combinations of herbivores. Cotton seedlings were damaged by foliar feeding Tetranychus urticae Koch (Trombidiforms: Tetranychidae), Helicoverpa armigera Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) or root feeding Tenebrio molitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Thrips responses <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> simultaneously damaged by 2 species of herbivore were additive and equivalent to {{the sum of the}} responses of thrips <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> damaged by single herbivore species feeding alone. For example, F. occidentalis was attracted to T. urticae damaged plants but more attracted <b>to</b> undamaged <b>plants</b> than <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> damaged by H. armigera. Plants simultaneously damaged by low densities of T. urticae and H. armigera repelled F. occidentalis but as T. urticae density increased relative to H. armigera density, F. occidentalis attraction <b>to</b> coinfested <b>plants</b> increased proportionally. Thrips tabaci did not discriminate between undamaged plants and plants damaged by H. armigera but were attracted <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> damaged by T. urticae alone or simultaneously damaged by T. urticae and H. armigera. Olfactometer assays showed that simultaneous feeding by 2 herbivores on a plant can affect predator–prey interactions. Attraction of F. occidentalis <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> damaged by its T. urticae prey was reduced when the plant was simultaneously damaged by H. armigera, T. molitor, or A. gossypii and F. schultzei was more attracted <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> simultaneously damaged by T. urticae and H. armigera than <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> damaged by T. urticae alone.
