5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the <b>fireproof</b> <b>bulkhead</b> and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E
500|$|The I-5 was a single-seat biplane with {{staggered}} {{wings in}} a sesquiplane configuration with fixed landing gear and a tailskid. The aircraft was of mixed construction, with the fuselage being {{made of a}} framework of welded steel tubes covered by a fabric skin over the rear fuselage, with the front fuselage section being covered by detachable duralumin panels {{as far back as}} the rear of the cockpit. There were also detachable panels allowing easy access to the tailskid shock absorber. The fabric skin was laced for tightness and the seams were covered with calico. A <b>fireproof</b> <b>bulkhead</b> separated the [...] fuel tank from the engine and a fire extinguisher was fitted with outlets to the fuel pump, inlet pipe and carburetor. The conventional landing gear was connected by a one-piece axle and some aircraft were fitted with teardrop-shaped spats covering the wheels. Initially the tailskid was fixed, but later aircraft had smaller skids that moved in concert with the rudder. Rubber rings were used as shock absorbers on the landing gear.|$|E
2500|$|The second aircraft, the Bristol Type 75 was {{powered by}} the {{preferred}} Jupiter engine, which was mounted behind a <b>fireproof</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> with the entire engine installation (or [...] "power-egg") capable of being swung open like a gate to allow {{easy access to the}} rear of the engine. The Type 75 was designed to accommodate eight passengers and two crew. This aircraft, registered G-EBEV, first flew in July 1922. A third aircraft, the Bristol Type 79 was ordered by the Air Council to meet a requirement (Specification 32/22) for a single-engined ambulance landplane for the Royal Air Force. It was fitted with wings of greater chord, and had accommodation for three stretchers and an attendant or two stretchers and four sitting patients.|$|E
40|$|These {{tests were}} {{performed}} in the Fire Hazard Testing Laboratory {{at the request of}} the Associate Committee of Astronautical Research with the purpose of comparing the relative effectiveness of various types of construction of <b>fireproof</b> <b>bulkheads</b> as required by the existing United States Civil Air Regulations and the British Air Ministry Civil Aircraft Regulations; to investigate other types of construction which might prove more effective and satisfactory than the present accepted designs and to permit a performance specification for firewall construction to be prepared.

6000|$|Therefore to a plain man {{who knows}} {{something}} of mathematics but is not bemused by calculations, she was, {{from the point of}} view of [...] "unsinkability," [...] not divided at all. What would you say of people who would boast of a fireproof building, an hotel, for instance, saying, [...] "Oh, we have it divided by <b>fireproof</b> <b>bulkheads</b> which would localise any outbreak," [...] and if you were to discover on closer inspection that these bulkheads closed no more than two-thirds of the openings they were meant to close, leaving above an open space through which draught, smoke, and fire could rush from one end of the building to the other? And, furthermore, that those partitions, being too high to climb over, the people confined in each menaced compartment had to stay there and become asphyxiated or roasted, because no exits to the outside, say to the roof, had been provided! What would you think of the intelligence or candour of these advertising people? What would you think of them? And yet, apart from the obvious difference in the action of fire and water, the cases are essentially the same.|$|R
50|$|The rear of {{the hull}} formed an engine room, {{separated}} from the fighting compartment by a <b>fireproof</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> The tank was powered by a 78 hp six-cylinder 86 x 100 3485 cc engine which was on {{the left of the}} engine compartment. A 160-litre fuel tank on the right, combined with a twenty litres reserve reservoir, gave a range of 129 kilometres or eight hours on a varied terrain. The engine was cooled by a centrifugal pump. Also a cooling fan drew air through the radiator and was also expected to cool the fuel tank. The trench-crossing capacity was 1.8 metres, the wading capacity 85 centimetres. On hard soil a slope of 75% could be climbed, on soft soil of 55%. Maximum tilt was 50%. Clearance was thirty-seven centimetres.|$|E
50|$|The {{airplane}} {{was designed}} by IAR design bureau in 1933 and was an evolution from the IAR 12 prototype. It was a cantilever low-winged monoplane with a spatted main undercarriage with V-form legs and a single, open cockpit over the wing. The rectangular section fuselage was of mixed metal-wood configuration, with the front half covered by duralumin sheets and the rear part with pine plywood. The tail had been modified once more and the control surfaces were balanced. The pilot's head rest was not fitted with the anti-crash pylon, typical to the precedent prototypes. The engine was mounted on welded steel bearers attached to a duralumin <b>fireproof</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> The wings were built around twin duralumin spars and pine and plywood ribs and had plywood leading edges. The centre section, let into the fuselage underside was duralumin covered, outer sections and ailerons fabric-covered. The fixed tail was built of pine and plywood-covered, the moving surfaces duralumin with fabric cover.|$|E
5000|$|The Lion-engined prototype, the Bristol Type 62, or Bristol Ten-seater, {{with the}} {{registration}} G-EAWY first flew on 21 June 1921. [...] The Ten-seater was a large, two-bay biplane, with a cabin for nine passengers and a forward cockpit {{for the single}} pilot.The second aircraft, the Bristol Type 75 was powered by the preferred Jupiter engine, which was mounted behind a <b>fireproof</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> with the entire engine installation (or [...] "power-egg") capable of being swung open like a gate to allow {{easy access to the}} rear of the engine.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{function}} as an effective long-range reconnaissance vehicle, the Panhard 178 had been kept as light as possible. The vehicle was thus rather small, only 4.79 m in length, 2.01 m wide and 2.31 m in height (1.65 m for the hull per se). Also the tapering engine compartment, where a Panhard ISK 4FII bis V4, 6332 CC, 105 hp at 2000 rpm motor had been installed, was built very low, giving the vehicle its distinctive silhouette, with a protruding fighting compartment. Both compartments were separated by a <b>fireproof</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> The use of a large turret with 26 mm frontal armour and 13 mm side armour, combined with 7 mm (bottom), 9 mm (top and glacis), 13 mm (back, sides and front superstructure) and 20 mm (nose) bolted and riveted armour plate for the hull, had compromised weight considerations however, so the vehicle still weighed 8.2 metric tonnes. However the mobility was rather good for a French AFV of the period: a maximum speed of 72.6 km/h, a cruising speed of 47 km/h and a practical range of about 300 km, made possible by two fuel tanks of 120 and 20 litres, the main one located at the extreme back of the hull.|$|E
5000|$|The Leopard 2 is {{propelled}} by the MTU MB 873 Ka-501 engine, which provides [...] at 2,600 rpm and 3,466 lb·ft Nm of torque at 1,600-1,700 rpm. The MTU MB 873 Ka-501 is a four-stroke, 47.7 litre, 90° V-block 12-cylinder, twin-turbocharged and intercooled, liquid-cooled diesel engine (with multi-fuel capability), {{which has an}} estimated fuel consumption rate of around 300 litres per 100 km on roads and 500 litres per 100 km across country, and is coupled to the Renk HSWL 354 gear and brake system. The Renk HSWL 354 transmission has four forward and two reverse gears, with a torque converter and is completely automatic, with the driver selecting the range. The Leopard 2 has four fuel tanks, which have a total capacity of approximately 1,160 litres, giving a maximum road range of about 500 km. The propulsion pack is capable of driving the tank to a top road speed of 72 km/h (limited to 50 km/h during peacetime by law), and top reverse is 31 km/h. The power pack can be changed {{in the field in}} 35 minutes. The engine and transmission is separated from the crew compartment through a <b>fireproof</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> An enhanced version of the EuroPowerPack, with a [...] MTU MT883 engine has also been trialled by the Leopard 2.|$|E
50|$|The {{hull of the}} M41 is of {{welded steel}} construction, with the driving {{compartment}} located {{at the front of}} the tank and to the left. This may be accessed through the hull by a single piece hatch cover opening to the right. When the hatch is closed, the tank is navigated by three driving periscopes mounted forward of the driver's position and one to the left. There is no night vision equipment fitted as standard, although in some models an infrared searchlight could be mounted externally on the turret or the day periscopes replaced with new infrared periscopes. An emergency escape hatch is situated beneath the driver's seat. The engine compartment is located towards the rear of the hull and is insulated from the crew by a <b>fireproof</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> The Allison Cross-Drive Model CD-500-3 transmission is located within this compartment, immediately behind the engine, and includes one forward and one reverse gear ratios. All M41 tanks utilize a torsion bar suspension, which supports five road wheels with the drive sprocket at the rear and idler towards the front, and three track return rollers. The first, second, and fifth road wheel stations have hydraulic shock absorbers. Although the M41 is not considered amphibious, it was designed for fording up to 1.016 meters of water without preparation, and up to 2.44 meters of water with preparation. The hull is fitted with electric bilge pumps accordingly.|$|E

5000|$|The {{rear part}} of the {{fuselage}} was a Warren girder based on four longerons, tapering towards the tail. The fuselage cross section was {{kept to a minimum}} to reduce drag and to this end the pilot sat on the cockpit floor. [...] There were concerns about ease of escape from this position under the rear wing spar, but it was after all, a racing machine. In front of him the structure was wire braced, the longerons converging to become overhung engine bearers. [...] The 32 hp (24 kW) Bristol Cherub II engine was mounted on a plate with a <b>fireproof</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> within a long, smooth aluminium cowling blended into the spinner of the two-bladed propeller. The Cherub's cylinder heads were exposed for cooling. A rounded decking, built up with stringers in the usual way, topped the fuselage from propeller to stern and contained the 4.5 imp gal tank immediately in front of the cockpit, high enough above the engine to allow it to be gravity fed. The overall fin plus rudder shape was not unlike the de Havilland form, though the rudder was not balanced. The tailplane had a straight leading edge inboard, then curved; it could be adjusted in incidence on the ground but not in the air. [...] Its elevators were unbalanced and divided to allow rudder movement. The undercarriage was a simple single axle design using rubber shock absorbers, with the main legs attached to the lower longerons at the same points as the lift struts and braced to the most forward fuselage frame. It was completed with a tail skid.|$|E
