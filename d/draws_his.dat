5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then <b>draws</b> <b>his</b> front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then <b>draws</b> <b>his</b> eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E

Later, when the train is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E

5|$|Before mating, {{males and}} females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his {{antennae}} on her head, palps, and antennae. In Eupompha, the male <b>draws</b> <b>his</b> antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all {{if they do not}} perform the precopulatory ritual. This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a Russian population of tansy beetle (Chysolina graminis) is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Unni, Babu, Shaji, Shenoy, and MLA meet atop an {{apartment}} building to discuss {{the circumstances surrounding the}} gold they smuggled into Kozhikode and lost to an ambush while in transit from the airport.

Arya seizes his sword and throws it into the river before running into the forest, where she drives away Nymeria and hides until dark.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom {{will be ready for}} the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn <b>draws</b> <b>his</b> gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E
5|$|In 1603, {{he painted}} a double {{portrait}}, {{now in the}} Metropolitan Museum, New York, of the prince and his boyhood friend John Harington, son of Lord Harington of Exton (see above). The double portrait is set outdoors, a style introduced by Gheeraerts in the 1590s, and Peake's combination of figures with animals and landscape also foreshadows the genre of the sporting picture. The country location and recreational subject lend the painting an air of informality. The action is natural to the setting, a fenced deer-park with a castle and town in the distance. Harington holds a wounded stag by the antlers as Henry <b>draws</b> <b>his</b> sword to deliver the coup de grâce. The prince wears at his belt a jewel of St George slaying the dragon, an allusion to his role as defender of the realm. His sword is an attribute of kingship, and the young noble kneels in his service.• Strong English Icon, 234. The stag is a fallow deer, a non-native species kept {{at that time in}} royal parks for hunting. A variant of this painting in the Royal Collection, painted c. 1605, features Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, in the place of John Harington and displays the Devereux arms.|$|E

5|$|Orca, {{voiced by}} Gideon Emery, is a {{mercenary}} {{employed by the}} private military company Shoreline. During Uncharted 4: A Thief's End he is a lieutenant {{under the command of}} Nadine Ross. After their client Rafe Adler finds Captain Avery's treasure on-board his booby-trapped pirate ship, Orca <b>draws</b> <b>his</b> gun on Ross after she protests Adler on risking further danger in boarding the ship, betraying her command by siding with treasure hunter in seizing the lucrative treasure. Orca later appears in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, taking command of Shoreline after Ross departs from the company, and has struck a deal with an Indian insurgency force headed by Asav. He purchases the Tusk of Ganesh from Asav in exchanging him a bomb that the insurgent leader plans to detonate in a nearby city to ignite a revolution. Orca later gets attacked by Ross and her associate Chloe Frazer inside his helicopter before it crashes to the ground, severely injuring him. After implying that he sold a bomb to Asav and giving up the Tusk, he quickly tries to shoot Ross but gets killed in return fire after she is saved by Sam Drake.|$|E
5|$|With only 30 minutes {{remaining}} {{before the}} ship is destroyed, Kirk considers transporting the entire crew to Caliban so they can survive. Scotty discovers Sulu's original transporter pattern, from when the warbird was destroyed. He theorizes that he could re-integrate it into the older version, resetting his memories {{so that he could}} remember the Romulan information and allowing him to pilot the Enterprise to safety but causing him to forget his 30 years on Caliban. Alana reassures him that she'll remind him of the man he became, but McCoy and Spock agree that leaving the rift will cause the death of Alana. Sulu <b>draws</b> <b>his</b> sword and is prepared to fight to save his daughter, but she talks him down. He strides onto the transporter pad and demands they reintegrate his pattern. As he is merged once again, Alana quotes The Tempest. The younger version of Sulu is taken to the bridge and pilots the Enterprise from the anomaly with seconds to spare, with Alana ceasing to exist as he does so. Back on the Excelsior, Captain Sulu meets with the shuttle passengers in his ready room; his daughter Demora (Mimi Chong) and is introduced to his baby granddaughter, Alana.|$|E
