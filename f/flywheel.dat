5|$|The {{episodes of}} <b>Flywheel,</b> Shyster, and <b>Flywheel</b> were recorded, {{but for many}} years it was thought the {{recordings}} had not been preserved. At {{the time of the}} broadcasts, pre-recorded shows were frowned upon by advertisers and audiences. However, in 1988, Michael Barson, who worked in the United States Copyright Office at the Library of Congress discovered that the scripts for twenty-five of the twenty-six episodes had been submitted to the Office, where they had been placed in storage. Nobody was aware that they still existed and their copyrights had not been renewed. This meant that <b>Flywheel,</b> Shyster, and <b>Flywheel</b> had fallen into the public domain. The scripts were published that same year by Pantheon in a book titled <b>Flywheel,</b> Shyster, and Flywheel: The Marx Brothers' Lost Radio Show, edited by Michael Barson and with an interview with Perrin. In October 1988, <b>Flywheel,</b> Shyster and <b>Flywheel</b> scenes were broadcast {{for the first time since}} the show went off the air in 1933 when National Public Radio, a non-profit media organization that provides content to public radio stations around the United States, aired an 18-minute recreation of <b>Flywheel,</b> Shyster and <b>Flywheel</b> in markets such as Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, using Washington, D.C.-based Arena Stage actors to perform the Chico and Groucho lead roles from the published scripts. Years later, three recordings of <b>Flywheel,</b> Shyster, and <b>Flywheel</b> were found, including a five-minute excerpt of Episode 24 and a fifteen-minute recording of Episode 25. A complete recording of Episode 26 exists and was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flywheel,</b> Shyster, and <b>Flywheel</b> aired Monday {{nights at}} 7:30p.m. on the NBC Blue Network to {{thirteen}} network affiliates in nine Eastern and Southern states. Twenty-six episodes were made, which were broadcast between November 28, 1932 and May 22, 1933. Each episode is {{introduced by the}} Blue Network announcer and features about fifteen minutes of drama and ten minutes of orchestral music between acts. The episodes end with Groucho and Chico – not in character, but as themselves – performing a 60-second skit promoting Esso and Essolube.|$|E
5|$|The program {{depicts the}} misadventures {{of a small}} New York law firm, with Groucho as {{attorney}} Waldorf T. <b>Flywheel</b> (a crooked lawyer) and Chico as Flywheel's assistant, Emmanuel Ravelli (a half-wit who <b>Flywheel</b> uses as a fall-guy). The series was originally titled Beagle, Shyster, and Beagle, with Groucho's character named Waldorf T. Beagle, until a real lawyer from New York named Beagle contacted NBC and threatened to file a lawsuit unless the name was dropped. Many of the episodes' plots were partly or largely based upon Marx Brothers films.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flywheels</b> {{are made}} from many {{different}} materials, the application determines the choice of material. Small <b>flywheels</b> made of lead are found in children’s toys. Cast iron <b>flywheels</b> are used in old steam engines. <b>Flywheels</b> used in car engines are made of cast or nodular iron, steel or aluminum. <b>Flywheels</b> made from high-strength steel or composites have been proposed for use in vehicle energy storage and braking systems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{new type}} test bench was {{developed}} for power train used in electric hybrid vehicle. This bench was mainly composed of inertial <b>flywheels,</b> brake, clutch, dynameters, and controller. When testing the power train, the engine, power train, inertial <b>flywheels,</b> brake, clutch and dynameters are connected in series. One end of inertial <b>flywheels</b> is connected with output end of power train; the other end is connected with a clutch. Between the inertial <b>flywheels</b> and clutch, there is a brake for braking of <b>flywheels.</b> The clutch is for connection and disconnection of inertial <b>flywheels</b> and dynameters. This new test bench can perform different power modes with corresponding operation modes set in the main controller...|$|R
50|$|<b>Flywheels</b> store {{energy in}} a {{spinning}} mass. Because {{a light and}} fast rotor is energetically favorable, <b>flywheels</b> can pose a significant safety hazard. Moreover, <b>flywheels</b> leak energy fairly quickly and affect a vehicle's steering through the gyroscopic effect. They have been used experimentally in gyrobuses.|$|R
5|$|<b>Flywheel,</b> Shyster, and <b>Flywheel</b> is a {{situation}} comedy radio show starring two of the Marx Brothers, Groucho and Chico, and written primarily by Nat Perrin and Arthur Sheekman. The series was originally broadcast in the United States on the National Broadcasting Company's Blue Network beginning November 28, 1932, and ended May 22, 1933. Sponsored by the Standard Oil Companies of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Louisiana and the Colonial Beacon Oil Company, it was the Monday night installment of the Five-Star Theater, an old-time radio variety series that offered a different program each weeknight. Episodes were broadcast live from NBC's WJZ station in New York City and later from a sound stage at RKO Pictures in Los Angeles, California, before returning to WJZ for the final episodes.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 it {{was decided}} to {{preserve}} the two remaining engines and incorporate them as the central feature in the Visitor Centre, including a Museum in the old boiler house, which opened in 1988 and attracts over 30,000 visitors a year. The <b>flywheel</b> is now driven by an electric motor. The pumping station is now a Grade II* listed building, while the gothic-style meter house is Grade II listed and used as a bat sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|Other {{propulsion}} problems included excessive motor vibrations {{at certain}} speeds which damaged various components (which {{was attributed to}} the removal of a <b>flywheel</b> and to corrosion caused by the fuel problems), and excessive fuel consumption in Collins at high speed (found {{to be caused by}} manufacturing problems with the turbines and turbochargers). The propulsion system was also found to be a secondary source of noise: poor design of the exhaust mufflers, weight-saving measures in the generator mountings, and an incorrect voltage supply to the battery compartment exhaust fans were noise-creating factors found and eliminated during studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation.|$|E
50|$|In industry, {{toggle action}} presses are still popular. The usual {{arrangement}} involves {{a very strong}} crankshaft and a heavy duty connecting rod which drives the press. Large and heavy <b>flywheels</b> are driven by electric motors but the <b>flywheels</b> only turn the crankshaft when clutches are activated.|$|R
50|$|Most road {{locomotives}} were {{fitted with}} disc <b>flywheels,</b> {{the idea of}} this being if they encountered horses en route, the horse would be less startled by the spinning disc. This theory was pretty much ruined when showmen began to decorate the <b>flywheels,</b> worsening the startling effect.|$|R
40|$|The {{technology}} and applications evaluation task focuses on defining performance and cost requirements for <b>flywheels</b> {{in the various}} areas of application. To date the DOE program has focused on automotive applications. The composite materials effort entails the testing of new commercial composites to determine their engineering properties. The rotor and containment development work uses data from these program elements {{to design and fabricate}} <b>flywheels.</b> The <b>flywheels</b> are then tested and their performance is evaluated to indicate possible areas for improvement. Once a rotor was fully developed it is transferred to the private sector...|$|R
5|$|Coming into series six as reigning champion, Razer {{started its}} title defence by {{qualifying}} from a four-way melee. It then defeated the pyramid-shaped robot Cyrax on a judges' decision {{to set up}} a heat final against Raging Reality. It pushed its opponent towards Matildas <b>flywheel,</b> which ripped off an entire side panel and caused Raging Reality to break down. This saw Razer reach the semi-finals for a second consecutive series. Against Wild Thing, Razer damaged one of its opponent's exposed drive wheels, hampering its movement. Subsequently, Razer grasped it with the arm and dropped Wild Thing into the pit. Razer next fought Dantomkia, which was armed with a pneumatic flipping arm. Although Razer was the early aggressor, Dantomkia retaliated by pushing Razer into the arena wall. The rest of the battle was similarly even, with Razer's more potent attacks being matched by Dantomkia's pushing power. The judges decided that Razer should move on to a second series final.|$|E
5|$|Titan uses Jaguar's 200 cabinets, {{covering}} 404 square meters (4,352 ft2), with replaced internals and upgraded networking. Reusing Jaguar's {{power and}} cooling systems saved approximately $20 million. Power is provided to each cabinet at three-phase 480 V. This requires thinner cables than the US standard 208 V, saving $1 million in copper. At its peak, Titan draws 8.2 MW, 1.2 MW more than Jaguar, but runs almost {{ten times as}} fast in terms of floating point calculations. In {{the event of a}} power failure, carbon fiber <b>flywheel</b> power storage can keep the networking and storage infrastructure running for up to 16 seconds. After 2 seconds without power, diesel generators fire up, taking approximately 7 seconds to reach full power. They can provide power indefinitely. The generators are designed only to keep the networking and storage components powered so that a reboot is much quicker; the generators are not capable of powering the processing infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Groucho Marx played Waldorf T. Beagle (later renamed Waldorf T. <b>Flywheel),</b> and Chico played Emmanuel Ravelli, {{the same}} name as the Italian {{character}} {{he played in the}} film Animal Crackers (1930). Mary McCoy played secretary Miss Dimple, and it is thought that Broderick Crawford also appeared as various characters. Groucho and Chico shared a weekly income of $6,500 for appearing in the show. During the Great Depression, this was considered a high sum for 30 minutes' work, especially since radio scripts required no memorization and only a few minutes were needed for costume, hair and makeup. By comparison, Greta Garbo's weekly salary from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during the same period was also $6,500, though this was for a 40- or 50-hour week. Wynn was paid $5,000 a week for Fire Chief. In contrast, almost two-thirds of American families were living on fewer than $26 a week. In a classic Marxian twist, Harpo was paid a weekly salary for not appearing on the show, even though his mute character would have little to do in a radio program anyway.|$|E

5|$|Evans {{had first}} begun to {{consider}} the potential applications of steam power for transportation while still an apprentice in the 1780s, and had developed rudimentary designs for 'steam carriages' in the 1790s. In 1801, Evans definitively began work on making his long-held dream of a steam carriage into reality. Early steam engineers, most notably Watt contemporary William Murdoch, had developed plans for a steam-propelled carriage incorporating a heavy <b>flywheel,</b> in which pressure was converted directly to rotary power, however it became apparent in experimentation that a low-pressure, rotary steam engine would never be powerful enough to propel a carriage of any weight forward. Evans's attention thus turned to a reciprocating engine, not only for his steam carriage ideas, but also for industrial application. Importantly, Evans became an early proponent of 'strong steam' or high-pressure engines, an idea long resisted by Watt and earlier steam pioneers because the necessary iron making and metal working technology was lacking. Evans recognized that a high-pressure steam engine would be essential {{to the development of}} a steam carriage because they could be built far smaller while providing similar or greater power outputs to low-pressure equivalents. Some experiments with high-pressure steam engines had been made in Europe, most notably an unsuccessful steam tractor developed by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. However the prevailing fear of early steam engineering was that no boiler could safely contain high-pressure steam. Evans ignored potential drawbacks, and developed radically different designs which called for engines operating at high-pressure and the elimination of the condenser—a central component of conventional designs. His designs also incorporated a grasshopper beam, a double-acting cylinder, and four steam valves. Each valve was independently operated by one of four cams. The resulting design was a high-pressure steam engine that had a higher power-to-weight ratio that prevailing designs, making locomotives and steamboats practical. It was also mechanically simpler than condensing engines, making it less costly to build and maintain, and did not require large volumes of condensing water. These features would make it similarly suited for a variety of industrial applications.|$|E
25|$|In 1920 the French {{automobile}} and aircraft pioneer Gabriel Voisin experimented with systems that modulated the hydraulic braking pressure on his aircraft brakes {{to reduce the}} risk of tire slippage. These systems use a <b>flywheel</b> and valve attached to a hydraulic line that feeds the brake cylinders. The <b>flywheel</b> is attached to a drum that runs at the same speed as the wheel. In normal braking, the drum and <b>flywheel</b> should spin at the same speed. However, when a wheel slows down, then the drum would do the same, leaving the <b>flywheel</b> spinning at a faster rate. This causes the valve to open, allowing a small amount of brake fluid to bypass the master cylinder into a local reservoir, lowering the pressure on the cylinder and releasing the brakes. The use of the drum and <b>flywheel</b> meant the valve only opened when the wheel was turning. In testing, a 30% improvement in braking performance was noted, because the pilots immediately applied full brakes instead of slowly increasing pressure in order to find the skid point. An additional benefit was the elimination of burned or burst tires.|$|E
25|$|Marx {{also worked}} as a radio comedian and show host. One of his {{earliest}} stints was a short-lived series in 1932, <b>Flywheel,</b> Shyster, and <b>Flywheel,</b> costarring Chico.

25|$|WHP {{was first}} {{established}} in 2008 and immediately set about {{developing a new}} <b>flywheel</b> energy-recovery system for the Williams F1 Team after the introduction of Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) into Formula One for the 2009 season. While other teams were pouring their efforts into electric battery systems, Williams F1 opted {{to go down the}} <b>flywheel</b> route because of a strong belief in the technology's wider applications. While it was never raced in Formula One due to technical changes, WHP has since seen its technology adapted for a range of applications. For example, the Audi R18 hybrid car that won the 2012 Le Mans 24 Hours used a WHP <b>flywheel.</b> WHP has also seen its <b>flywheel</b> technology introduced into a series of buses as part of a deal with the Go-Ahead Group, one of the UK's biggest transport operators. In April 2014, Williams Hybrid Power was sold to GKN.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} Chico and Groucho starred {{in a radio}} comedy series, <b>Flywheel,</b> Shyster and <b>Flywheel.</b> Though the series was short lived, much of the {{material}} developed for it was used in subsequent films.
