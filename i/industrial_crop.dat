According to an analysis in the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service report of 2015, it is grown as an <b>industrial</b> <b>crop</b> in 15% of the nation's land.

25|$|The {{integration}} of plant cultivation in El Paraíso occurred slowly {{as there were}} plentiful sources of marine organisms. Due to the evidence of such high marine resources, agriculture mainly acted as an industrial resource. The earliest cultigens {{are found to be}} cotton (Gossypium barbadense) and bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) which date back to 2500B.C. Other cultigens include squash (Cucurbita ficifolia, C. maxima, and C. moschata), chili pepper (Capiscum sp), the common bean (P. vulgaris), achira (Canne edulis) and jicama (Pachyrrhizus tuberosus). There are remnants of guava, Lucuma and pacae which insist on a varied diet as well as management over some crops that were not cultivated. An abundance of Solanum spp., found within coprolite remains indicates there were plants ranging from night shades to potatoes most likely being domesticated as well. Cotton is one of the highest found crops at the site. It was important as an <b>industrial</b> <b>crop</b> to build nets and lines for catching fish and other marine resources. It also doubled as a resource manufactured into textiles to make clothing.|$|E
500|$|Cotton {{production}} in Pakistan {{is integral to}} the economic development of the country. The nation is largely dependent on the cotton industry and its related textile sector, and the crop {{has been given a}} principal status in the country. Cotton is grown as an <b>industrial</b> <b>crop</b> in 15% of the nation's land during the monsoon months of May to August, known as the kharif period, and is grown at a smaller scale between February and April. Record production of cotton was reported at 15 million bales of [...] each in the form of phutti (seed cotton) during 2014–15, which was an 11% rise compared to the previous season (2013–14). Production-wise, as of 2012–13, Pakistan occupied the fourth position among the cotton growers of the world, the first three being China, India and the United States, in that order. In respect of exports of raw cotton, Pakistan holds third position, and is the fourth in consumption (about 30 and 40 per cent of its production). It is the largest exporter of cotton yarn.|$|E

2500|$|For Mustafa Kemal, {{as for his}} supporters, tobacco {{remained}} {{wedded to}} his policy {{in the pursuit of}} economic independence.

2500|$|As far as {{industry}} and agriculture were concerned, the trends that {{were set in}} motion in the transitional period after 1670 continued unabated. The Dutch economy remained a high-real-wage and high-tax economy, which discouraged investment in labor-intensive pursuits. This caused a decline of labor-intensive industries, like the textile industry, and of capital-goods industries like shipbuilding (both suffering {{from a lack of}} innovation also, which made it even more difficult to conquer foreign markets). That decline was only partially compensated by the growth of industries requiring proximity to ports, or large inputs of skilled labor (which was still in abundant supply) and fixed capital. The agricultural sector, faced with the same pressures, specialized in two directions: less labor-intensive livestock raising on the one hand, and very labor-intensive <b>industrial</b> <b>crop</b> production on the other. Trade shifted from the intra-European [...] "mother trade" [...] serving the Baltic and the Mediterranean to intercontinental trade (colonial wares) and distribution to the German hinterland (which was now a rising market again, after finally recovering from the ravages of the Thirty Years' War). Trade changed in other respects also: shipping became more of a service industry, offering shipping services to merchants of other countries. Trade-related financial services shifted from direct financing to acceptance credit.|$|E

50|$|Egyptians {{relied on}} {{agriculture}} {{for more than}} just the production of food. They were creative in their use of plants, using them for medicine, as part of their religious practices, and in the production of clothing. Herbs perhaps had the most varied purposes; they were used in cooking, medicine, as cosmetics and in the process of embalming. Over 2000 different species of flowering or aromatic plants have been found in tombs. Papyrus was an extremely versatile crop that grew wild and was also cultivated. The roots of the plant were eaten as food, but it was primarily used as an <b>industrial</b> <b>crop.</b> The stem of the plant was used to make boats, mats and paper. Flax was another important <b>industrial</b> <b>crop</b> that had several uses.
