5|$|On 7 March 2009 the RIRA claimed {{responsibility}} for the 2009 Massereene Barracks shooting. This shooting occurred outside the Massereene Barracks as four soldiers were receiving a pizza delivery. Two soldiers were killed, and the other two soldiers and two deliverymen were injured. On 3 April 2009 the RIRA in Derry {{claimed responsibility}} for carrying out a punishment shooting {{of a man who was}} awaiting sentencing for raping a 15-year-old girl. The RIRA were also blamed for orchestrating rioting in the Ardoyne area of Belfast on 13 July 2009 as an Apprentice Boys parade was passing. Several PSNI officers were injured in the rioting and at least one shot was fired at police. In early November, the <b>Independent</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Commission released a report stating that the threat from the RIRA and other dissident republicans was at its most serious level since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.|$|E

25|$|While other {{international}} instruments already exist in this field, the Council of Europe Convention, the first European treaty in this field, {{is a comprehensive}} treaty focusing mainly on the protection of victims of trafficking and the safeguard of their rights.

25|$|The Assembly is {{chaired by}} the Speaker and three Deputy Speakers, of whom one is {{appointed}} Principal Deputy Speaker.

25|$|Throughout {{the crisis}} the Russian and Ukrainian sides blamed {{each other for}} the cutoff. On January 11 and 12, the European Union {{deployed}} an <b>independent</b> <b>monitoring</b> mission in an attempt to solve the crisis, but the mission met with little success. On January 12, Gazprom announced that it was willing to start delivering gas through the Sudzha metering station into the pipeline that traverses Ukraine towards Southeastern Europe, but Ukraine refused the offer for technical reasons and instead suggested an alternative route through Valuyki and Pisarevka metering stations, additionally insisting that supplies be fully restored. This was refused by Gazprom.|$|E
25|$|It was {{estimated}} that the IRA carried out 1,000 armed robberies in Northern Ireland, mostly of banks and post offices. It was accused {{of involvement in the}} biggest bank raid in Irish history—the 2004 Northern Bank robbery—when £26.5 million was stolen from the Northern Bank in Belfast city centre. The PSNI, the <b>Independent</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Commission and the British and Irish governments all accused the IRA of involvement. It is suggested that the IRA needed the money to pay pensions to its volunteers, and to ensure that hardliners stuck with the peace strategy. The IRA denied involvement, however.|$|E
25|$|In May 2005, the <b>Independent</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Commission {{recommended}} {{a continuation of}} the financial sanctions on his Assembly salary imposed following its report of April 2004. The IMC was of the opinion that the UVF and the PUP maintain strong links while the UVF is heavily involved in criminality such as drug dealing and tobacco and fuel smuggling. It further noted that the UVF was responsible for a number of acts of violence including murder and was actively maintaining its capacity to wage a terrorist campaign. It concluded that 12 months after the sanctions were originally imposed, the PUP leadership was still not doing enough to address the UVF's criminal and paramilitary activities.|$|E

50|$|A {{perceived}} heavy-handed attitude by {{the bigger}} organisations caused {{a number of}} smaller groups to be formed in response.

25|$|Since {{the process}} of {{decommissioning}} was completed, unnamed sources in MI5 and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) have reported to the press that not all IRA arms were destroyed during the process. This claim remains unsubstantiated so far. In its report dated April 2006 the <b>Independent</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Commission (IMC) stated {{that it had no}} reason to disbelieve the IRA or to suspect that it had not fully decommissioned. It believed that any weaponry that had not been handed in had been retained locally and against the wishes of the IRA leadership. The Russian and British Intelligence services alleged that during the decommissioning process the IRA secretly purchased a consignment of 20 Russian special forces AN-94 rifles in Moscow.|$|E
25|$|On 10 February 2005, the government-appointed <b>Independent</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Commission {{reported}} that it firmly supported the PSNI and Garda Síochána assessments that the IRA {{was responsible for the}} Northern Bank robbery and that certain senior members of Sinn Féin were also senior members of the IRA and would have had knowledge of and given approval to the carrying out of the robbery. Sinn Féin has argued that the IMC is not independent, and that the inclusion of former Alliance Party leader John Alderdice and a British security head was proof of this. The IMC recommended further financial sanctions against Sinn Féin members of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The British government responded by saying it would ask MPs to vote to withdraw the parliamentary allowances of the four Sinn Féin MPs elected in 2001.|$|E
500|$|The Munk School of Global Affairs {{encompasses}} the university's various programs and curricula {{in international affairs}} and foreign policy.

500|$|After McKevitt's imprisonment, the RIRA regrouped. The RIRA claimed {{responsibility}} {{for a series of}} firebomb attacks against premises in Belfast in November 2004, and an attack on a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) patrol in Ballymena during March 2006 was attributed to the RIRA by the <b>Independent</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Commission (IMC). On 9 August 2006, fire bomb attacks by the RIRA hit businesses in Newry, County Down. Buildings belonging to JJB Sports and Carpetright were destroyed, and ones belonging to MFI and TK Maxx were badly damaged. On 27 October 2006, a large amount of explosives was found in Kilbranish, Mount Leinster, County Carlow by police, who believe the RIRA were trying to derail the peace process with a bomb attack. The IMC believe the RIRA were also responsible for a failed mortar attack on Craigavon PSNI Station on 4 December 2006. The IMC's October 2006 report stated that the RIRA remains [...] "active and dangerous" [...] and that it seeks to [...] "sustain its position as a terrorist organisation". The RIRA has stated it has no intention of calling a ceasefire unless a declaration of intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland is made by the British Government.|$|E

50|$|Based {{on these}} testimonies {{and with the}} help of an {{architect}} working with 3D modeling software, Amnesty and Forensic Architecture have constructed a model on the entire prison. As they remembered, the witnesses added objects like torture tools, blankets, furniture, and areas where they recalled them being used. In Sednaya, the architecture of the prison emerges not only as a location of torture but itself as an instrument in its perpetration. Forensic Architecture's project on Sednaya is part of a larger campaign run by Amnesty International. The project aims to pressure the Syrian government to allow <b>independent</b> <b>monitors</b> into the detention centres. Amnesty urged Russia and the United States to use their power to admit <b>independent</b> <b>monitors</b> to investigate conditions in Syria's torture prisons.|$|R
