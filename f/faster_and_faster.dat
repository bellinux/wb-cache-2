As the flow continues to pass into and through the centrifugal impeller, the impeller forces the flow to spin <b>faster</b> <b>and</b> <b>faster.</b> According {{to a form of}} Euler's fluid dynamics equation, known as pump and turbine equation, the energy input to the fluid is proportional to the flow's local spinning velocity multiplied by the local impeller tangential velocity.|$|E
25|$|Coins {{can also}} be spun {{on a flat surface}} such as a table. This results in the {{following}} phenomenon: as the coin falls over and rolls on its edge, it spins <b>faster</b> <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> (formally, the precession rate of the symmetry axis of the coin, i.e., the axis passing from one face of the coin to the other) before coming to an abrupt stop. This is mathematically modeled as a finite-time singularity – the precession rate is accelerating to infinity, before it suddenly stops, and has been studied using high speed photography and devices such as Euler's Disk. The slowing down is predominantly caused by rolling friction (air resistance is minor), and the singularity (divergence of the precession rate) can be modeled as a power law with exponent approximately −1/3.|$|E

40|$|Overall, the glucose/leptin ratio {{can be used}} in {{addition}} to glucose/insulin ratio, Quantitative Insulin-Sensitivity Check Index, and Homeostasis Model Assessment to accurately assess insulin resistance in subjects with hyperglycemia. Objectives: To identify the fasting glucose/leptin ratio as a new simple method for the detection of insulin resistance in Iraqi diabetes mellitus patients, and to examine its usefulness as a new marker for insulin resistance. Methods: A case control study conducted at the National Diabetes Center, College of Medicine at Al-Mustansiryia University from 1 August 2008 to 30 January 2010. An enzyme spectrophotometric method was used to determine fasting glucose, while HPLC Technique determined leptin and insulin hormones in serum of patients with diabetes mellitus (n= 61) and normal healthy subjects as controls (n= 63). Results: A positive significant correlation with linear regression equations were found between <b>fasting</b> insulin <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> leptin hormones, <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> glucose/insulin <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> glucose/leptin ratios among the diabetic patient group. While negative, significant correlations were found with linear regression equations between <b>fasting</b> insulin <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> glucose/insulin ratio, <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> insulin <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> glucose/leptin ratio in patients group.

40|$|Abstract Rats were <b>fasted</b> or <b>fasted</b> <b>and</b> refed simple {{purified}} diets so {{the effects}} of individual carbohydrates or fats could be studied. Freshly isolated hepatocytes from these animals were used to measure both apoE synthesis and mRNA levels so any changes in apoE synthesis that might occur without changes in its mRNA could be detected. Some of these experiments were done with both sexes. Both <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> refeeding a 60 76 glucose fat-free diet significantly increased spoE synthesis. However, cyclic AMP {{is not likely to}} rapidly mediate the effect of fasting since dibutyryl CAMP slightly lowered (rather than increased) apoE synthesis and mRNA when injected into rats for 4. 5 h. Dietary fat had no effect either in the absence of carbohydrate or when consumption of carbohydrate was constant in pair-fed rats. ApoE mRNA levels remained normal for 4 days in primary hepatocytes cultured in medium that had only amino acids as an energy source. Added hormones or fructose had no significant effect. Thus, only <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> refeeding glucose were able to significantly change apoE synthesis or mRNA levels.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] {{was directed by}} Dave Meyers and choreographed by Tina Landon. It begins with Shakira and her love interest doing tango in a bar-like setting, starting with a low paced routine. The tango becomes faster and more intricate as the opening beat of the song kicks in. Shakira's love interest exits the bar abruptly, leaving her alone to dance to the song. She follows the man in a yellow car and arrives at a club where she sees him with another woman, played by Hawaiian actress Tabitha Taylor. An animated cartoon-styled sequence follows as Shakira jumps over the crowd and fights her unfaithful lover and Taylor. While wrestling the latter, Shakira pinches both of her nipples and her breasts are shown to reduce in size as the line [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal" [...] plays. After Shakira defeats the man, the animated sequence ends and the fight is shown to happen only in Shakira's imagination. When she tries to fight the man and Taylor in reality, she is quickly defeated and crashes into a glass table. Two men resembling comical superheroes, {{one of whom is}} played by Dan Southworth, appear to her aid and quickly defeat the man, while Shakira defeats Taylor. The two are shown gagged up in the boot of Shakira's car and are then tied up on spinning discs. The discs rotate <b>faster</b> <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> until they come off and are sent flying off at a high speed. Scenes of Shakira dancing at the bar and performing the song with a band are interspersed throughout the video. The music video reached number one on the Total Request Live chart.|$|E
