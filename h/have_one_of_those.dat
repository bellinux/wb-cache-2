It contains [...] "slow breaks", that according to Jamil Ahmad of musicOMH, [...] "wrap this record round you like walking into an exclusive club with a million dollar sound system – {{you know you are}} going to <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> nights".

Love previously had become known for his impressions of various Game of Thrones characters, uploading the video to YouTube, which ultimately resulted in his appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Following the appearance, Love stated that he had received an email from Benioff offering him a part in the show, saying [...] "I broached the subject by sending them an email back saying 'Listen I don't know what your plans are for me but it would really mean a lot to me if I could <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> trademark Game of Thrones gruesome death scenes, and they wrote back saying 'Actually Steve, that was exactly what we had in mind for you.'" ...|$|E
500|$|South of {{the terrace}} lawn are the Upper and Lower lakes, scene of Churchill's most ambitious {{landscaping}} schemes. The Lower lake had existed during the Colquhouns' ownership, but the island within it, and the Upper lake, were Churchill's own creations. On 1 January 1935, while Lady Churchill {{was on a}} cruise off Sumatra, Churchill described the beginnings of his endeavours {{in one of his}} Chartwell Bulletins; [...] "I have arranged to <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> great mechanical diggers. In one week he can do more than 40 men can do. There is no difficulty about bringing him in as he is a caterpillar and can walk over the most sloppy fields". Excavation work proved more challenging than Churchill had anticipated, two weeks later he wrote again, [...] "The mechanical digger has arrived. He moves about on his caterpillars only with the greatest difficulty on this wet ground".|$|E

500|$|Underwood {{was created}} to give Carter a [...] "strong female antagonist", and Butters noted that [...] "we said, wouldn’t it be great to <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> people who is living right there with her be {{actually}} a bad guy?" [...] In late January 2015, Butters and Fazekas revealed that Underwood {{is a product of}} the precursor to the Black Widow program. Regan did not know the character was a Black Widow when auditioning, but quickly learned after being cast, as the showrunners wanted her to change her then current red hair, in order to avoid being [...] "a tip to the audience, because of Natasha [...] They didn’t want to imply that every Black Widow had red hair and they didn’t want the audience to see it coming." [...] Regan trained with a Tae Kwan Do expert and studied Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow choreography from the films in preparation for the character's fight scenes, while Ottobre-Melton referenced her Black Widow status by using the colors red and black. Underwood's initial [...] "small-town girl from Iowa" [...] persona was based on Judy Garland's Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E

2500|$|The verb {{classes in}} Arabic are formed along two axes. The first or derivational axis (described as [...] "form I", [...] "form II", etc.) {{is used to}} specify {{grammatical}} concepts such as causative, intensive, passive or reflexive and mostly involves varying the consonants of a stem form. For example, from the root K-T-B [...] "write" [...] are derived form I kteb/ykteb [...] "write", form II ketteb/yketteb [...] "cause to write", form III kateb/ykateb [...] "correspond with (someone)" [...] etc. The second or weakness axis (described as [...] "strong", [...] "weak", [...] "hollow", [...] "doubled" [...] or [...] "assimilated") {{is determined by the}} specific consonants making up the root, especially whether a particular consonant is a [...] "w" [...] or [...] " [...] y", and mostly involves varying the nature and location of the vowels of a stem form. For example, so-called weak verbs <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> two letters as the last root consonant, which is reflected in the stem as a final vowel instead of a final consonant (ṛma/yṛmi [...] "throw" [...] from Ṛ-M-Y). Meanwhile, hollow verbs are usually caused by one of those two letters as the middle root consonant, and the stems of such verbs have a full vowel (/a/, /i/ or /u/) before the final consonant, often along with only two consonants (žab/yžib [...] "bring" [...] from Ž-Y-B).|$|E
