50|$|Baltit, {{which was}} the {{original}} capital of the Hunza valley, {{was established in the}} 13th century. A fort was built, in the backdrop of snow clad mountains, in the 17th century when Mir Ayesho II's (great-grandson of Girkis, a legendary ruler) wife, the daughter of the Balti ruler, came to live in Hunza. The fort was built in Balti-style by the artisans brought by her. It was refurbished during Ayesho II's son's rule. Mir Nazim Khan got it refurnished with wall paper, curtains, fireplaces, balconies, and windows with tinted glass. The exterior of the fort was given a white wash. He also built a raised platform in the terrace to hold meetings of the council. Once the capital was moved to Karimabad, the fort was stripped of all its interior furnishings and decorations. Nazim Khan's son had moved to Karimabad in 1945.It was a deserted structure in 1984. However, between 1990 and 1996 the fort was completely rebuilt with all structural elements of the old fort to its original plan taking <b>earthquake</b> <b>factor</b> into consideration. The fort presents a view as if it has been newly built but retains all the original features, and commands a scenic view of the Hunsa valley. Some of the rooms in the fort have exhibits of dresses and pictures as also some ancient vessels and furniture donated by the local people.|$|E

Besides that, earthquake originated mainly from epicenters in the western zones arising from the Sumatra and Philippines. The {{aim of this study}} is to study the behaviour reinforced concrete of Multi-storey building that subjected to earthquake excitation. Thus, this research present comparative analysis using SAP 2000 and Esteem 8 software (shear forces and moment resistances). During this phase, all the information, data, studies and facts that are related to study, should be known. The information to be collected is useful for model and analyze our structure. The information and data that required are architectural drawing of the building and the earthquake data. Raw data of earthquake originated from Tsunami in Aceh which recorded in Malaysia seismic stations will be collected from Malaysian Meteorological Department (MMD).

40|$|Abstract Background An {{earthquake}} measuring 6. 8 on the Richter scale {{struck the}} Niigata-Chuetsu region of Japan at 5. 56 P. M. on the 23 rd of October, 2004. The earthquake {{was followed by}} sustained occurrence of numerous aftershocks, which delayed reconstruction of community lifelines. Even {{one year after the}} earthquake, 9, 160 people were living in temporary housing. Such a devastating earthquake and life after the earthquake in an unfamiliar environment should cause psychological distress, especially among the elderly. Methods Psychological distress was measured using the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12) in 2, 083 subjects (69 % response rate) who were living in transient housing five months after the earthquake. GHQ- 12 was scored using the original method, Likert scoring and corrected method. The subjects were asked to assess their psychological status before the earthquake, their psychological status at the most stressful time after the earthquake and their psychological status at five months after the earthquake. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was used to reveal the factor structure of GHQ 12. Multiple regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between various background factors and GHQ- 12 score and its subscale. Results GHQ- 12 scores were significantly elevated at the most stressful time and they were significantly high even at five months after the <b>earthquake.</b> <b>Factor</b> analysis revealed that a model consisting of two factors (social dysfunction and dysphoria) using corrected GHQ scoring showed a high level of goodness-of-fit. Multiple regression analysis revealed that age of subjects affected GHQ- 12 scores. GHQ- 12 score as well as its factor 'social dysfunction' scale were increased with increasing age of subjects at five months after the earthquake. Conclusion Impaired psychological recovery was observed even at five months after the Niigata-Chuetsu Earthquake in the elderly. The elderly were more affected by matters relating to coping with daily problems. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{input energy}} to a {{structure}} during an earthquake {{is an important}} measure of seismic demand. The elastic input energy in a multi-degree-of-freedom system can be computed from a Fourier Amplitude Spectrum (FAS) and the real part of the relative velocity transfer function of dierent modes. One of the essential characteristics of the seismological method is that it distills {{what is known about}} the various factors aecting ground motions into dierent functional forms and, for this reason, the modal analysis-based method in the frequency domain is very ecient in the computation and evaluation of earthquake input energy. The earthquake input energy reliability is dependent on ground motion variables. In this paper, to compare the eect of strong ground motion variables, the contribution of these sources of variability to the input energy's uncertainty is examined by using a stochastic analysis. The analytical results show that <b>earthquake</b> source <b>factors</b> and soil condition variables are the main source of uncertainty in the input energy spectra, while path variables, such as source-site distance, anelastic attenuation and upper crust attenuation, have relatively little eect...|$|R

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the seismic action, which the structures must withstand, is the most critical item of the full process of analysis, monitoring and mitigation of seismic risk. Seismic action has been recorded worldwide for moderate to severe earthquakes. In the last 30 years the recorded accelerations have been significantly increased. One reason could be {{the increasing number of}} recording stations and the location of many such stations on soft soil, where significant site amplification can occur. In many cases, the recorded accelerations have exceeded the designed acceleration given by seismic codes. This is particularly true {{in the case of a}} strong earthquake, when the {{evaluation of}} seismic action given by source mechanism results, in some cases, in a seismic design earthquake greater than that given by the probabilistic evaluation reported by the codes. Also in the case of the moderate ML = 5. 8 Abruzzo earthquake, the recorded acceleration exceeded the provisions given by Italian Code. Mainly two factors could explain that. One factor is related to the different results obtained by the probabilistic evaluation of seismic action given by the codes and the deterministic seismic action evaluated by source modelling of the scenario <b>earthquake.</b> The second <b>factor</b> is related to the role of site amplification, which is higher for small to moderate earthquakes and lower for severe scenario <b>earthquakes.</b> These two <b>factors</b> are discussed for the case of the Abruzzo 2009 earthquake where, because of the normal fault mechanism, severe vertical components of the acceleration were recorded; also significant site effects occurred, particularly in the Aterno valley...|$|R

40|$|Measurement is the {{foundation}} of epidemiologic thought and practice. The appropriate measurement of exposures and outcomes of interest is the underlying assumption to all causal investigations. Poor quality measurement, be it through inappropriate data collection methods or changing diagnostic criteria, which can result in erroneous estimates, has a deleterious impact on scientists, policy makers, and the public. Mental health disorders particularly suffer from a lack of diagnostic clarity as diagnosis is often based on self-report of overlapping symptoms with no clear measureable biomarkers. The release of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM- 5) in May of 2013 is the most recent attempt to codify existing diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic criteria shifted from a three-cluster approach of avoidance, hyper-arousal, and re- experiencing to a four-cluster approach of avoidance, arousal, negative cognitions and mood, and re- experiencing. The very existence of multiple diagnostic frameworks for the same psychiatric disorder is proof that accurate diagnosis is a complex and unresolved issue that warrants investigation. This complexity in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom presentation, limits our ability to develop appropriate responses. In this dissertation I conducted four independent but related studies to explore the construct validity of PTSD. In Chapter 1 I systematically reviewed the extant empiric literature from PubMed and PsychINFO on PTSD symptom structure to identify a universal PTSD factor structure. I found 40 (3 %) of 1, 302 citations published between 1980 - 2014 provided empiric PTSD factor structure estimates forming the basis of my review. While consensus exists with respect to the general multifactorial make-up of PTSD, a universal understanding of the specific operationalization of this structure, supported by the empiric literature, is absent. In Chapter 2, I used population-based, cross-sectional data from adult survivors of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, to assesses model fit of six theoretical factor structures of PTSD: one-factor Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) -IV; three-factor DSM-IV-TR (arousal, avoidance, and intrusion); three-main factor (arousal, avoidance, and intrusion) and one-hierarchical factor DSM-IV-TR; four-factor King 1998 (avoidance, hypervigilance, emotional numbing, re-experiencing); four-factor Simms 2002 (avoidance, dysphoria, hyperarousal, intrusion); and four-factor DSM- 5 (arousal, avoidance, intrusion, negative mood and cognition) models through confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). While all models adequately fit the data, the three-factor DSM-IV-TR (arousal, avoidance, and intrusion) model best fit the sample (χ 2 = 593. 257, 116 degrees of freedom; RMSEA= 0. 056; CFI= 0. 927; TLI= 0. 915, WRMR= 1. 769; AIC= 24, 760. 459; and BIC= 24, 952. 178). Again drawing on the cross-sectional, population data from Haitian earthquake survivors, in Chapter 3 I used multiple linear regressions to model pre-, peri-, and post-earthquake factor associations with mean PTSD symptom cluster (arousal, intrusion, and avoidance, validated in Chapter 2) endorsement. I found that mean PTSD symptom factor endorsement is heterogeneously associated with pre-, peri-, and post- <b>earthquake</b> <b>factors,</b> consistent with dimensional theoretical foundations: arousal endorsement more likely to be associated with pre-earthquake factors, intrusion endorsement more likely to be associated with factors across the temporal field, and avoidance endorsement more likely to be associated with post- <b>earthquake</b> <b>factors.</b> In Chapter 4, I used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to assess the factor stability of the DSM-IV-TR (arousal, intrusion, avoidance) defined PTSD structure when major depressive disorder (MDD) items are introduced, in the same Haitian post-earthquake population-based study. A six-factor, 25 -item model was estimated and fit the data (χ 2 = 253. 427, 165 degrees of freedom, p< 0. 001; RMSEA= 0. 021, 90 % CI: 0. 016, 0. 026; CFI= 0. 987; TLI= 0. 976) better than the PTSD-only model specified in Chapter 2. PTSD-specific items did not load on the original PTSD factors or with the original factor items (new factors included items from 0 - 3 different original PTSD factors), in the presence of MDD items. PTSD dimensionality was not stable in the presence of MDD items, thus challenging the discriminant validity of PTSD. This exploration into PTSD construct validity found that while consensus exists with respect to the general multifactorial make-up of PTSD, a universal understanding of the specific operationalization of this structure, supported by the empiric literature, is absent. The tight range in model fit statistics documented in the CFA provides additional evidence of this, suggesting that empirical-based model selection is insufficient to universally characterize PTSD. Given the overall consensus of general factors, the significant and heterogeneous pre-, peri-, and post-earthquake factor associations with the unique PTSD symptom clusters provides additional evidence of the multidimensional theoretical mechanisms behind PTSD psychopathology. PTSD model stability, an indication of discriminant validity, failed to hold when challenged by MDD items, further challenging PTSD construct validity. There are several important implications of this work. First, based on the systematic review and CFA findings, adjudication of PTSD model selection based on empiric findings is insufficient and should be theoretically driven. Future investigations should always include the most commonly supported models as they develop and refine additional models, thus enabling rigorous cross-context, cross-potentially traumatic event, and cross-study comparisons that are currently not possible. Second, the multidimensional modeling of PTSD factors provided valuable insight into the psychopathology of PTSD without additional data collection burden and should be widely adopted. Researchers should look to model PTSD both as a dichotomous variable and on a continuous scale, both as a complete construct and by each dimensional component. Third, while the exploration into discriminant validity builds on another study that found PTSD factor structure unstable in the presence of MDD item challenges, more research is needed here to understand the theoretic and empiric utility of the specified six-factor model across settings and diagnostic criteria. Fourth, while endeavoring to explore construct validity, exploratory qualitative methods with populations beyond the highly studied U. S. military populations are needed to propose additional items that could, provide valuable missing empiric evidence for PTSD factor dimensionality...|$|R

Based on rainfall data interpreted from X-band Doppler Radar of the HARIMAU project provided by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) at Padang Pariaman Regency, rainfall of moderate intensity began at about 12 : 30, some hours prior to the earthquake shock at 17 : 16 local time (Figure  6). Antecedent rainfall of 30  mm/h was recorded in the previous night. It is suspected that this rainfall {{played a major role}} in the triggering of the landslide. The contribution of rainfall to earthquake-induced landslides is of great concern in the volcanic area surrounding the west coast of Sumatra, which has an equatorial weather that usually brings high intensity rainfall, even during dry season periods (Sipayung et al. [2007]). Based on the latest meteorological research on west coast of Sumatra, high intensity rainfall is frequently recorded in the late afternoon or evening, and distribution of such rainfall is strongly controlled by the mountainous topography of the area (Wu et al. [2009]). The combined effects of seismic activity and meteorological conditions in this area create a high risk of failure of the saturated volcanic deposits during <b>earthquakes.</b> These <b>factors</b> must be taken into consideration in geo-hazard assessment and mitigation.|$|R
40|$|A {{seismic hazard}} map {{proposed}} {{as part of}} a new building code for Romania is presented here on basis of the recommendations in EUROCODE 8. Seismic source zones within an area of about 200 km around Romania were constructed considering seismicity, neotectonics and geological development. The probabilistic seismic hazard assessment in terms of intensities is performed following Cornell (1968) with the program EQRISK (see Mc Guire, 1976), modified by us for use of intensities. To cope with the irregular isoseismals of the Vrancea intermediate depth <b>earthquakes</b> a <b>factor</b> Ω is introduced to the attenuation law (Kövesligethy, 1907). Using detailed macroseismic maps of three earthquakes Ω is calculated by fitting the attenuation law to observed intensities, i. e. to local ground conditions. Strong local variation of Ω is avoided by a gridding of 0. 5 ° in longitude and 0. 25 ° in latitude. The contribution of the Vrancea intermediate depth zone to the seismic hazard at each grid point is computed with the corresponding representative Ω. A seismogenic depth of 120 km is assumed. The final seismic hazard is the combination of both contributions, of zones with crustal earthquakes and of the Vrancea intermediate depth earthquakes zone. Calculations are done for a recurrence period of 95, 475 and 10000 years. All maps show the dominating effects of the intermediate depth earthquakes in the Vrancea zone, also for the capital Bucharest.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Telecommunication towers {{are among}} the few steel {{structures}} that {{little attention has been}} paid to their seismic behavior in existing design codes. Due to lack of design provisions, the designers apply the existing building design codes to telecommunication towers. However, the seismic behavior and response of telecommunication towers is very different from that of building structures. For example, the base shear values obtained for telecommunication towers using the building codes is much higher than what it actually is. In this research, for obtaining the seismic amplification factors, ten of the existing self-supporting four-legged telecommunication towers in Iran with heights ranging from 18 to 67 meters are selected. Then, strong motion earthquakes are applied to these towers in both vertical and horizontal directions. By performing linear dynamic analysis, the base shear and vertical response of the towers are calculated. Dividing the obtained base shear or the vertical response by the product of the tower mass and maximum horizontal and/or vertical acceleration components will result in seismic amplification factors of both horizontal and vertical earthquake components. At the end, by drawing the amplification factors versus the fundamental flexural mode and the first axial mode of the towers, relations for estimating the base shear and the vertical response of the telecommunication towers are obtained.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{earthquake}} types, magnitudes, and hysteretic behavior on the peak and residual ductility demands of inelastic single-degree-of-freedom systems and evaluates {{the effects of}} major aftershocks on the nonlinear structural responses. An extensive dataset of real mainshock-aftershock sequences for Japanese earthquakes is developed. The constructed dataset is large, compared with previous datasets of similar kinds, and includes numerous sequences from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, facilitating an investigation of spatial aspects of the aftershock effects. The empirical assessment of peak and residual ductility demands of numerous inelastic systems having different vibration periods, yield strengths, and hysteretic characteristics indicates {{that the increase in}} seismic demand measures due to aftershocks occurs rarely but can be significant. For a large mega-thrust subduction <b>earthquake,</b> a critical <b>factor</b> for major aftershock damage is the spatial occurrence process of aftershocks...|$|R
