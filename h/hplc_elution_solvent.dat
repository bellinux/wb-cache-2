40|$|Background and objectives: According {{to recent}} studies, homotaurine {{may be an}} Alzheimer's active ingredient. The goal of this project was to extract and detect homotaurine in algae {{collected}} from Persian Gulf shores. Methods: Extraction was done with etanol 80 % for 30 min in ambient temperature. The <b>HPLC</b> <b>elution</b> <b>solvent</b> required a mixture of two solvents. Solvent A was ammonium acetate buffer and solvent B was methanol. The solvents were filtered and degassed before use. Isocratic elution was carried out at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The chromatographic analysis was conducted at ambient temperature. Results: The results of the measurements showed that some algae samples lacked measurable amounts of homotaurine. In this analysis ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6. 5) and mixture of methanol and acetonitrile (50 : 50 v/v) were applied as the mobile phase in the gradient mode. The OPA derivative was detected at 336 nm of excitation and emission wavelengths. The peaks of homotaurine were appeared at retention time of 12 min, respectively. Conclusion: The present method can be well applied for measurement of homotaurin in algae for anti-alzheimer tests in the future...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to achiveve solvent switching and focusing of sub-column-volume analyte fractions in liquid chromatography is presented. By altering the temperature between loading and elution in back-flush mode, solvent transfer of analytes and focusing occurs, {{provided that the}} analytes exhibit temperature dependent retention on a given trap column. When retention on the trap decreases with increasing temperature, which is almost always the case, the loading of the trap-column takes place at a higher temperature than the elution. This principle is demonstrated using three small aromatic molecules (toluene, p-xylene and benzophenone) on a capillary monolithic column. On this column, the analytes show a traditional van’t Hoff dependence on temperature with enthalpy effects of, − 15, − 16 and − 18 kJ mol− 1, respectively, for a mobile phase of 25 % acetonitrile in water.

The research results showed that: {{the concentration of}} sample solution was 1. 0 mg/mL and the pH was 2. 0, adsorption flow rate was 1 mL/min, the highest absorption ratio was 93. 65 %. The <b>elution</b> <b>solvent</b> was 4 BV of 70 % ethanol and the desorption flow rate can be reached up to 1 mL/min. AB- 8 macroporous resin could be separated and purified of anthocyanins from black beans. The anthocyanins produced by the above conditions was black powder, the color value of purified anthocynins was 17. 72 times {{higher than that of}} the beginning. This study laid foundation for the industrial production of anthocyanin in black hulls of natural pigments, and had a positive {{role in the development of}} health care products...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{fragments}} {{that show}} {{a pattern of}} differential expression on differential display gels must be eluted from the gel matrix and reamplified to enable further analysis. Elution is usually achieved by heating excised gel slices in a small volume of either water or TE. Here we show that this elution step can adversely affect {{the ability of the}} eluted DNA to act as a template for PCR reamplification, probably via the process of depurination. Simply switching to an <b>elution</b> <b>solvent</b> designed to minimise depurination (PCR buffer) facilitates the elution of intact DNA fragments. This improvement is likely to be most beneficial when eluting higher molecular weight fragments (e. g. those > 500 bp), in situations where the amount of DNA in an excised gel slice is limited or when contaminating differential display products co-migrate with the differentially expressed product...|$|R
