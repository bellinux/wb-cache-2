5000|$|An iris slow is a wipe {{that takes}} {{the shape of a}} growing or {{shrinking}} circle. It has been frequently used in animated short subjects, such as those in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoon series, to signify the end of a story. When used in this manner, the <b>iris</b> <b>wipe</b> may be centered on a certain focal point and may be used as a device for a [...] "parting shot" [...] joke, a fourth wall-breaching wink by a character, or other purposes.|$|E
5000|$|A French Dachshund called ZeFronk hosts {{a healthy}} cooking show from his {{doghouse}} with his assistant, a songbird named Sue, and his silly neighbour cat named Dom that always sneaks away the snacks that ZeFronk makes, and each episode ends with ZeFronk chasing Dom around the prep counter, triggering Sue to fly away and {{come through the}} <b>iris</b> <b>wipe.</b> The first-season episodes ended with a bonus live-action segment in which a mother and child made the meal featured in the episode, although these segments were later removed due to time constraints.|$|E
50|$|The film is {{an affectionate}} {{parody of the}} classic horror film genre, in {{particular}} the various film adaptations of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein produced by Universal in the 1930s. Most of the lab equipment used as props was created by Kenneth Strickfaden for the 1931 film Frankenstein. To help evoke {{the atmosphere of the}} earlier films, Brooks shot the picture entirely in black and white, a rarity in the 1970s, and employed 1930s' style opening credits and scene transitions such as <b>iris</b> outs, <b>wipes,</b> and fades to black. The film also features a period score by Brooks' longtime composer John Morris.|$|R
500|$|Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum {{was shot}} entirely on indoor sets, with the {{exception}} of a few horse riding sequences. For changes of scenes, <b>irises</b> and <b>wipes</b> were used which, according to Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema by Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, added a [...] "sense of anachronism" [...] to the film. It was also the first full-length Tamil colour film, shot in Gevacolor. Rajadhyaksha and Willemen claim it to be the first South Indian film in Gevacolor, despite the fact that the 1955 Tamil film Kanavaney Kankanda Deivam had a few sequences in Gevacolor. The scenes involving horses, which belonged to the Mysore Reserve Police, were shot at Mysore over ten days. The thieves' cave, designed by Dominic, was created at two locationsâ€” the exterior cave scenes with the horses were shot at Mysore, while the interior scenes were shot at Yercaud near Salem. Sundaram brought twenty horses from Mysore for the shoot at Yercaud. The jewels and gold coins featured in the film were actually clay painted in gold.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first public}} {{screening}} of L'Homme du large {{took place on}} 3 December 1920 at the Gaumont Palace in Paris. It was enthusiastically received by {{both the public and}} the press. [...] Its critical reputation was well-sustained in subsequent years. Film archivist Henri Langlois described it as [...] "the first example of film writing". He argued that the film was not just a narrative of events linked together by intertitles, but a sequence of images whose message conveyed an idea; the superimposed titles reinforced the images in the manner of ideograms. While some critics were troubled by the contrast between the film's natural environment of coast and sea and its aesthetic use of frequent editing <b>wipes,</b> <b>irises</b> and superimpositions, there was broader appreciation for the rhythmic structure of shots and sequences, forming what L'Herbier saw as a [...] "musical composition".|$|R
