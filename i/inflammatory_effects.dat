25|$|Health, {{safety and}} {{environmental}} aspects of nanocellulose have been recently evaluated. Processing of nanocellulose {{does not cause}} significant exposure to fine particles during friction grinding or spray drying. No evidence of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> or cytotoxicity on mouse or human macrophages can be observed after exposure to nanocellulose. The results of toxicity studies suggest that nanocellulose is not cytotoxic and does not cause any effects on inflammatory system in macrophages. In addition, nanocellulose is not acutely toxic to Vibrio fischeri in environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E

2500|$|When fine {{particles}} of crystalline silica dust are {{deposited in the}} lungs, macrophages that ingest the dust particles will set off an inflammation response by releasing tumor necrosis factors, interleukin-1, leukotriene B4 and other cytokines. [...] In turn, these stimulate fibroblasts to proliferate and produce collagen around the silica particle, thus resulting in fibrosis {{and the formation of}} the nodular lesions. [...] The <b>inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> of crystalline silica are apparently mediated by the NALP3 inflammasome.|$|E
2500|$|Being obese or {{overweight}} both {{appear to}} be associated with increased risk. The association with obesity seems to be the strongest of any type of obesity-related cancer, though the reasons for this remain unclear. Abdominal obesity seems to be of particular relevance, given the closeness of its association with this type of cancer, as well as with both GERD and Barrett's esophagus. This type of obesity is characteristic of men. [...] Physiologically, it stimulates GERD and also has other chronic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
2500|$|IgA has two subclasses (IgA1 and IgA2) {{and can be}} {{produced}} as a monomeric {{as well as a}} dimeric form. The IgA dimeric form is the most prevalent and is also called secretory IgA (sIgA). [...] sIgA is the main immunoglobulin found in mucous secretions, including tears, saliva, sweat, colostrum and secretions from the genitourinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, prostate and respiratory epithelium. It is also found in small amounts in blood. The secretory component of sIgA protects the immunoglobulin from being degraded by proteolytic enzymes, thus sIgA can survive in the harsh gastrointestinal tract environment and provide protection against microbes that multiply in body secretions. sIgA can also inhibit <b>inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> of other immunoglobulins. IgA is a poor activator of the complement system, and opsonises only weakly.|$|E

6000|$|Inborn tendencies, as we {{perceive}} on every side, {{are far from}} having unlimited irresistible mastery, if they meet early encounter from some wise and patient external will. The father of Rousseau was unfortunately cast in the same mould as his mother, and the child's own morbid sensibility was stimulated and deepened by the excessive sensibility of his first companion. Isaac Rousseau, in many of his traits, was a reversion to an old French type. In all the Genevese there was an underlying tendency of this kind. [...] "Under a phlegmatic and cool air," [...] wrote Rousseau, when warning his countrymen against the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> of the drama, [...] "the Genevese hide an ardent and sensitive character, that is more easily moved than controlled."[4] And some of the episodes in their history during the eighteenth century might be taken for scenes from the turbulent dramas of Paris. But Isaac Rousseau's restlessness, his eager emotion, his quick and punctilious sense of personal dignity, his heedlessness of ordered affairs, were not common in Geneva, fortunately for the stability of her society and the prosperity of her citizens. This disorder of spirit descended in modified form to the son; {{it was inevitable that}} he should be indirectly affected by it. Before he was seven years old he had learnt from his father to indulge a passion for the reading of romances. The child and the man passed whole nights in a fictitious world, reading to one another in turn, absorbed by vivid interest in imaginary situations, until the morning note of the birds recalled them to a sense of the conditions of more actual life, and made the elder cry out in confusion that he was the more childish of the two.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was the {{establishment}} of the ex vivo Comet Assay and micronucleus test in primary type II cells (AE II cells) of the rat. Additionally, both tests were performed on cells (alveolar macrophages) obtained after in situ bronoalveolar lavage (BAL). DNA breaks/alkali-labile sites/oxidative damage (oxidative comet assay) and chromosome/genome mutations (micronucleus test) were assessed after three days of applications. The rats received a single i. tr instillation of 0. 2 mg/rat DQ 12 and i. p. urethane dose about 300 mg/kg/day in three days. BAL-fluid levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein and ?-Glucuronidase were used as lung damage markers. The DNA damage was significantly increased in rat type II pneumocytes exposed to DQ 12 and urethane. An oxidative damage could not be detected. An increase in micronunclei was only found in vivo in the bone marrow of DQ 12 treated rats. Level of LDH, total protein and ?-Glucuronidase were three to four fold increased in the BAL of rats treated with DQ 12, the level being indicative for an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>effect</b> due to this substance. This study indicates the potential to detect chromosomen/genome mutations and DNA breaks/alkali-labile sites in relevant target cells (type II pneumocytes) after i. tr. instillation of quartz and i. p. application of urethane.
