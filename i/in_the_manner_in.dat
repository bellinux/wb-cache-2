5|$|Van der Weyden {{may have}} drawn {{influence}} from Stefan Lochner's c.1435 Last Judgement, {{and a similar}} c.1420 painting now in the Hotel de Ville, Diest, Belgium. Points of reference include Christ raised over a Great Deësis of saints, apostles and clergy above depictions of the entrance to Heaven and the gates of Hell. In both earlier works Christ perches on a rainbow; in the Deësis panel he also is above a globe. While these two earlier works are filled with dread and chaos, van der Weyden's panels display the same sorrowful, but self-controlled dignity of his best works. This is most evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which the oversized and dispassionate Christ orchestrates the scene from Heaven.|$|E
5|$|These {{powers were}} {{generally}} devolved {{to the prime}} minister and ministers. The matters are political by nature and call for political judgment rather than judicial control. Thus, Parliament is the most appropriate forum for debate and the best qualified to control the executive. However, in practice, parliamentary accountability of ministers is not entirely effective. The prerogative powers that the government officials exercise on behalf of the Crown, coupled with a weak system of checks and balances between the Parliament and the executive, can lead to an abuse of those powers which may be detrimental to the people. The possibility of such abuse, coupled with the way administrative law and judicial review evolved since the 1960s– a period of judicial activism– led courts in the United Kingdom to take an increasing interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which prerogative powers had been exercised.|$|E

Although not utilised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which it was originally designed, this continued occupation has been instrumental in maintaining the Fort as an example of living history as opposed to being a museum piece.|$|E

25|$|Art remains {{relevant}} {{to issues of}} identity and representation. San art, which has been created with intense political intent, has awakened the San politically. Western collectors of art often interpret and classify San Art as ‘primitive art’ which creates a challenge in changing the stereotypes linked to San Art. In beadmaking Ju|’hoan jewellery shows that the main expression of San self-made jewellery is found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which it is worn rather than the patterns of design.|$|E
25|$|The memoirs, however, {{extend this}} {{assistance}} to {{all facets of}} Bahá'u'lláh's life. In one edition of the memoir, Dolgorukov {{is said to have}} provided money for Bahá'u'lláh to build a house in Acre, but Dolgorukov died in 1867, before Bahá'u'lláh arrived in Acre. Thus newer editions of the memoir state that Dolgorukov sent money for a house to be built in Edirne. As Dolgorukov left the Russian diplomatic service in 1854 and died in 1867, he was unable to interact with Bahá'u'lláh <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which the memoir states.|$|E

After being in Elvis' employment for two decades, both Red West and Sonny West were only paid a few weeks' severance pay. Their requests to speak directly to Elvis about their employment termination and the nominal severance pay were not granted. Red West, Sonny West, and Elvis himself felt betrayed, and all parties were upset with one another <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which they were fired.|$|E

The channel apologized after Adelson threatened a lawsuit. This led to the resignations of the news chief, Reudor Benziman; the news editor, Ruti Yuval; and the news anchor, Guy Zohar, who objected to the apology. After two months of deliberations, the Israeli Second Authority for Television and Radio ruled that although there were some flaws <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which the apology had been conducted, the decision to apologize had been correct and appropriate.|$|E

25|$|Cases {{became so}} {{complicated}} that a special assize, the Assize of Utrum {{was established in}} the middle of the 12th century. Jurisdiction would normally lie in the Ecclesiastic Courts. The Assize of Utrum, especially as defined in the Constitutions of Clarendon, 1164, gave the Crown a chance to clarify difficult questions of ownership and duty in a non-religious, secular court. Often, ownership was of less importance than in determining who had rights to grain, knight service, marriage penalties and the like. These duties were defined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which the land had been granted, and by whom in the feudal chain. Frequently land would be donated to a church organization and re-let to the grantor to avoid feudal services to the great lord.|$|E
25|$|The book {{is perhaps}} most {{important}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which it provides the viewpoint of one of Wellington's foot soldiers {{at a time when}} so many were illiterate. Whilst some officers kept diaries or wrote memoirs of their service, The Recollections of Rifleman Harris is rare because unlike the grand actions or great people recalled by his superiors, Harris mentions dozens of men whose history is no longer remembered and whose names would otherwise be lost, and records the details of daily ennui with interesting and colloquial prose. He describes medicine from a patient's point of view, punishment from a friend of the victim's view, and military life from the bottom up, giving insight to the daily life of a soldier in the Napoleonic Wars, as well as a valuable primary source to some of the British campaigns of the period.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{depictions of}} {{earthquakes}} in film are variable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which they reflect human psychological {{reactions to the}} actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones. Disaster mental health response research emphasizes {{the need to be}} aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival. Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who are able to protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake, and to help them make sense of what has befallen them has been shown even more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions. As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate these reactions, to support constructive problem-solving and reflection as to how one might improve the conditions of those affected.|$|E

Thus, at Navarino, the location of Nestor’s palace was determined from Homer and the adjectives “inaccessible” and “sandy”. At Methoni, “the ancient remains of the port of which the description matches perfectly with that of Pausanias are enough to determine with certainty the location of the ancient town.” ...|$|E
