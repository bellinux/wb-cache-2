25|$|Piaget's theory, however {{vital in}} {{understanding}} child psychology, {{did not go}} without scrutiny. A main figure whose ideas contradicted Piaget's ideas was the Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky. Vygotsky {{stressed the importance of}} a child's cultural background as an effect to the stages of development. Because different cultures stress different social interactions, this challenged Piaget's theory that the hierarchy of learning development had to develop in succession. Vygotsky introduced the term Zone of proximal development as an overall task a child would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> that would be too difficult to develop alone.|$|E
25|$|The IceHogs had {{a shorter}} {{off-season}} than usual {{due to their}} major league affiliate, the Chicago Blackhawks, having an extended 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs and winning the Stanley Cup. Head coach Ted Dent believed Rockford would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> new top scorers to replace those who left the team. Nevertheless, much of the focus in off-season practices went toward defense and discipline, particularly on avoiding taking penalties. The IceHogs played a pair of preseason exhibition away games, starting with a 2–1 victory over the Chicago Wolves on September 25. Jared Brown and Matt Lowry both scored for Rockford, but were nevertheless released from the team the next day. The IceHogs lost the preseason finale 2–1 to the Milwaukee Admirals on September 27, which Winchester scoring the team's only goal. The game went to a shootout, where nobody from either team scored until Milwaukee's Mathieu Tousignant in the tenth round.|$|E

25|$|In 1878, Edison {{began working}} on a system of {{electrical}} illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting. He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, {{something that would be}} needed for indoor use. Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta's demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer, William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich Göbel. Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high electric current drawn, making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially. Edison realized that to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must have high resistance and use relatively low voltage (around 110 volts).|$|E

A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it {{with the other hand}} (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound.

[...] Phares also said that although the album wasn't winning considering the high-profile songwriters and producers involved, [...] "it's fine for anyone who just wants to hear more of Ashley Tisdale's -- and not Sharpay Evans' -- singing." [...] Jon Dolan of Blender said Tisdale did not import her [...] "spunky" [...] High School Musical character in the album, and that even {{with the quality of}} producers, [...] "no stylistic slipper fits right." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard said Tisdale went, [...] "the contemporary CHR school of fellow Mouse products Britney Spears and first-album Christina Aguilera—lots of synthesizer-laden, beat-heavy, layered-vocal dance tracks" [...] that varied between [...] "come-hithers" [...] and [...] "self-affirming anthems." [...] Graff commented, [...] "she'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a more defined identity before she can truly win our affections." [...] James Ross of The Arizona Daily Wildcat commended the album's uptempo songs but critiqued the ballads, commenting she hits the right notes on uptempo numbers, while on ballads, [...] "Any 'Musical' fan knows that Tisdale can belt one out, but this is not apparent on the album." [...] Overall, Ross said, [...] "Although the album fails in places, it is ll [...] a worthy attempt by an up-and-coming pop artist to please her audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 14, 1972, Bill Torrey, {{executive}} vice president of the NHL's California Golden Seals, was named as the team's general manager. The Islanders secured veteran forward Ed Westfall, Gerry Hart, and goaltender Billy Smith in the 1972 Expansion Draft, along with junior league stars Billy Harris, Lorne Henning, and Bobby Nystrom in the 1972 Amateur Draft. Soon after the draft, Phil Goyette was named as the team's first head coach, however he was fired halfway through the season and replaced with Earl Ingarfield and assistant coach Aut Erickson. Unlike most other expansion teams' general managers, Torrey made few trades for veteran players in the early years, as he was committed to building the team through the draft; he stated, [...] "I told the owners that we're not going to beat this team next door by taking the castoffs from others teams. We'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> our own stars." [...] Before the season began, Westfall was named the team's first captain. Their first win came on October 12, 1972 in a 3-2 game against the Los Angeles Kings. In the team's first season, young players such as Smith, Nystrom, and Henning (all of whom would be part of the Islanders dynasty that would win four straight Stanley Cups in the 1980s) were given chances to prove themselves in the NHL. However, the young and inexperienced expansion team posted a record of 12–60–6, setting an NHL record for amount of losses and worst overall record in a season. A rare highlight occurred on January 18 when they defeated the defending Stanley Cup Champion Boston Bruins 9-7.|$|E
