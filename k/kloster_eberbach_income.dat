The village has a lithium spring, spa and a Kurhaus, and is famed for its red wine (Assmannshäuser) made from Pinot noir (German: Spätburgunder), which resembles red Burgundy wine.

50|$|Joseph Schmitt was {{a student}} of Carl Friedrich Abel, who {{was a student}} of J.S.

For a period of around 20 years worked as a musical priest at the Cistercian <b>Eberbach</b> Abbey (<b>Kloster</b> <b>Eberbach)</b> in the Rheingau, where he composed {{a broad range of}} music, from sacred to secular, chamber to symphonic.|$|R
50|$|The {{vineyards}} of Eberbach Abbey were, at 300 hectares, {{the largest}} in medieval Europe. Most of them are now {{the property of the}} state of Hesse and are run by the Hessische Staatsweingüter GmbH <b>Kloster</b> <b>Eberbach,</b> which manages the largest connected area of wine production in Germany, comprising vineyards on the slopes of the Rhine Valley and on the Hessische Bergstrasse. Of the 200 hectares which are under cultivation, three-quarters are planted with Riesling, but Chardonnay, Pinot blanc, Pinot gris, Pinot noir and Dornfelder are also grown.|$|R
50|$|The first number (1-9) {{relates to}} the German wine region where the wine was {{produced}} and tested (e.g. 3-Rheingau). The second 2 or 3 digit number indicates the village of the vineyard (e.g. 30-Rauenthal)). The next two digits represents the particular wine estate (e.g. 50-Kloster Eberbach). The following 2 to 3 digit number is the sequential order that the wine was submitted by that producer for testing (e.g. 031 - this was the 31st wine submitted by <b>Kloster</b> <b>Eberbach</b> for testing). The final two digits is {{the year of the}} testing, which is normally the year following the vintage (e.g. 04 - the wine was tested in 2004).|$|R
25|$|Before {{the era of}} Charlemagne, Germanic {{viticulture}} was practiced primarily, {{although not}} exclusively, {{on the western side}} of Rhine. Charlemagne is supposed to have brought viticulture to Rheingau. The eastward spread of viticulture coincided with the spread of Christianity, which was supported by Charlemagne. Thus, in Medieval Germany, churches and monasteries played the most important role in viticulture, and especially in the production of quality wine. Two Rheingau examples illustrate this: archbishop Ruthard of Mainz (reigning 1089-1109) founded a Benedictine abbey on slopes above Geisenheim, the ground of which later became Schloss Johannisberg. His successor Adalbert of Mainz donated land above Hattenheim in 1135 to Cistercians, sent out from Clairvaux in Champagne, who founded <b>Kloster</b> <b>Eberbach.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Eltville is touristically {{developed}} and {{well known for}} its wine and sekt production, which can be sampled at many wineries and Straußwirtschaften (seasonal wine shops). Of particular importance is the Vinothek, which brings together every leading estate's wines so that wine lovers can compare the products. It is the only local Vinothek in the Rheingau and one of few in Germany. Eltville is the headquarters of MM-Sektkellerei (which today belongs to Rotkäppchen-Sekt), Hessische Staatsweingüter <b>Kloster</b> <b>Eberbach</b> (Hessian State Wine Estates of Eberbach Monastery), and Sektmanufaktur Schloss Vaux, {{as well as the}} biggest industrial employer in the Rheingau, Jean Müller GmbH Elektrotechnische Fabrik. Eltville is one of Germany's ten [...] "Rosenstädte" [...] (rose towns).|$|R
5000|$|Heinrich Birk (1898 - 1973) was a German viticulturist. He {{was head}} of the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute. Heinrich Birk studied {{philosophy}} at the University of Giessen after his initial graduation 1920-1923 in agronomy at the university of Bonn and after 1924 in addition to an initial position on the domain Steinberg, <b>Kloster</b> <b>Eberbach.</b> He received his doctorate in this subject in 1929. [...] At this time he was already two years as clerk at the Geisenheim Research Center at the Institute of vines finishing as an assistant to Professor F. Muth. 1939 he became head of the Reichs-Rebenzuchtstation (Reichs-vine breeding station). He had to quit a year later because of his compulsory military service. 1945 Birk returned and devoted himself in postwar reconstruction.|$|R
50|$|Since the Verona {{donation}} in 983, the Rheingau {{belonged to}} the archbishopric of Mainz. Legend has it that Charlemagne let the first vineyards be planted in the region, close to present-day Schloss Johannisberg. However finds like a Roman origin grapevine cutting knife point to even earlier cultivation. Better documented is the early influence of the church on Rheingau winemaking, which was controlled from Eberbach Abbey. Augustinians and Benedictines {{are known to have}} inhabited the area of the later abbey from 1116, and in 1135 the Cistercians arrived, sent out from Clairvaux. Legend has it that the Cistercians, which are also credited with having founded the wine industry in Burgundy, brought Pinot noir with them to Rheingau, although the earliest record of the grape variety in Rheingau is from 1470. The slopes down from the Taunus mountains belonging to <b>Kloster</b> <b>Eberbach</b> were planted as vineyards in the 12th Century, and early in the 13th Century the vineyards had reached their present area. In medieval times, more red than white wine was produced, usually as Gemischter Satz, i.e. the vineyards were planted with mixed varieties which were vinified together.|$|R
