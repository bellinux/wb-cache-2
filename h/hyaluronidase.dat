5|$|M. nigrocincta ants have highly venomous stings {{which are}} painful and produce intense burning sensations. The sensations last for many {{days and the}} sting itches. If left untreated, the sting may develop into an ulcer. The venom of a closely related species, M. pilosula is amongst the strongest of the Formicidae and {{contains}} active ingredients such as acid and alkaline phosphatases, <b>hyaluronidase,</b> as well as phospholipases A2 and B. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 265 of the 376 participants taking {{part of the study}} reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, 176 reacted to the M. pilosula, 15 to M. nigrocincta, three to M. ludlowi, and 56 to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. Besides Myrmecia species, these included the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica).|$|E
5|$|More {{than a dozen}} {{peptides}} {{and other}} substances have been isolated from the Gila monster's venom, including <b>hyaluronidase,</b> serotonin, phospholipase A2, and several kallikrein-like glycoproteins responsible for the pain and edema caused by a bite. Four potentially lethal toxins have been isolated from the Gila monster's venom, including horridum venom, which causes hemorrhage in internal organs and exophthalmos (bulging of the eyes), and helothermine, which causes lethargy, partial paralysis of the limbs, and hypothermia in rats. Most are similar in form to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which relaxes smooth muscle and regulates water and electrolyte secretion between the small and large intestines. These bioactive peptides are able to bind to VIP receptors in many different human tissues. One of these, helodermin, {{has been shown to}} inhibit the growth of lung cancer.|$|E

25|$|<b>Hyaluronidase</b> (also {{known as}} {{spreading}} factor) breaks down hyaluronic acid and helps in spreading it. S. aureus also produces deoxyribonuclease, which {{breaks down the}} DNA, lipase to digest lipids, staphylokinase to dissolve fibrin and aid in spread, and beta-lactamase for drug resistance.|$|E
25|$|Head: It has {{a compact}} nucleus with only {{chromatic}} substance and {{is surrounded by}} only a thin rim of cytoplasm. Above the nucleus lies a cap-like structure called the acrosome, formed by modification of the Golgi body and which secretes enzyme spermlysin (<b>hyaluronidase,</b> corona-penetrating enzyme, zona eyesin, or aerosin.) On {{the surface of the}} head lies a decapcitating substance which is removed before fertilisation.|$|E
25|$|These modes {{describe}} basic splicing mechanisms, but may {{be inadequate}} to describe complex splicing events. For instance, the figure to the right shows 3 spliceforms from the mouse <b>hyaluronidase</b> 3 gene. Comparing the exonic structure shown in the first line (green) with {{the one in the}} second line (yellow) shows intron retention, whereas the comparison between the second and the third spliceform (yellow vs. blue) exhibits exon skipping. A model nomenclature to uniquely designate all possible splicing patterns has recently been proposed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyaluronidases</b> are {{a family}} of enzymes that {{catalyse}} the degradation of hyaluronic acid (HA). Karl Meyer classified these enzymes in 1971 into three distinct groups, a scheme based on the enzyme reaction products. The three main types of <b>hyaluronidases</b> are two classes of eukaryotic endoglycosidase hydrolases and a prokaryotic lyase-type of glycosidase.|$|R
30|$|One of the {{potential}} reasons for the variable effect of HA treatments on OA patients is levels of <b>hyaluronidases</b> in a patient’s synovial fluid. <b>Hyaluronidases</b> are a family of enzymes that degrade hyaluronic acid through cleaving the β(1 – 4) linkages of HA, fracturing the large molecule into smaller pieces before degrading it [22].|$|R
30|$|While {{there is}} little {{evidence}} for degradation of CS and KS within the ECM, the size of the HA decreases with age (Holmes et al. [1988]), presumably due to depolymerization by <b>hyaluronidases</b> or free radicals (Stern et al. [2007]). A series of genes have been identified coding for glycosyl hydrolase-like proteins termed <b>hyaluronidases</b> (Csoka et al. [2001]; Stern et al. [2007]). However only two of these appear to be true <b>hyaluronidases</b> relevant to extracellular matrix degradation. While hyaluronidase- 1 cleaves hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate very effectively, it has a very low pH optimum as befits its normal lysosomal location. In contrast hyaluronidase- 2 is active at neutral pH and at least a portion of it is located at the cell surface (Miller et al. [2006]). Hyaluronidase- 2 has been shown to cleave hyaluronan into relatively large fragments which are then taken up by the cell and degraded by hyaluronidase- 1 and β-hexosaminidase (Gushulak et al. [2012]).|$|R
25|$|Snake venoms {{are complex}} {{mixtures}} of proteins, and {{are stored in}} venom glands {{at the back of}} the head. In all venomous snakes, these glands open through ducts into grooved or hollow teeth in the upper jaw. These proteins can potentially be a mix of neurotoxins (which attack the nervous system), hemotoxins (which attack the circulatory system), cytotoxins, bungarotoxins and many other toxins that affect the body in different ways. Almost all snake venom contains <b>hyaluronidase,</b> an enzyme that ensures rapid diffusion of the venom.|$|E
25|$|The species {{within the}} {{hymenopteran}} order commonly sting or bite others {{with which they}} interact. After a man was stung by a European hornet, he experienced tingling {{at the site of}} contact, as well as headaches and shortness of breath. In the hospital, he was found to have a fast, irregular heartbeat with a blood pressure of 111/63. His subsequent ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. V. crabro toxin contains neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenalineneurotoxin apamin, as well as enzymes phospholipase A and <b>hyaluronidase,</b> the compound histamine, and proteins melittin and bradykinin. These compounds have been shown to cause tachycardia episodes in smaller animals. The mechanism of this attack is still undetermined, but this man possibly was just more susceptible to vespine stings than other humans. Currently, the two most effective treatments are electrical cardioversion or propafenone. The man in this case study was given an oral dose of propafenone (150mg) and his atrial fibrillation resolved.|$|E
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae form large colonies (>0.5cm) after 24 {{hours of}} incubation, and produce haemolysis on blood agar; SDSD is alpha-haemolytic, whereas SDSE is {{predominantly}} beta-haemolytic. They are facultative anaerobic, incapable of respiratory metabolism, but are aerotolerant. Growth {{is enhanced by}} incubation in 5% CO2 atmosphere, but they usually grow adequately in ambient air. The optimum temperature for growth is approximately 37° Celsius. Lancefield group C and G carbohydrate antigens are predominantly expressed, but group A and L have been documented. However, the above characteristics are not unique to S.dysgalactiae, and further testing is required to confirm the species identity. Although many laboratories currently identify bacteria by mass-spectrometry (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/ionization Time Of Flight (MALDI TOF MS), phenotypic testing is still widely used. Unlike Streptococcus pyogenes (harbouring Lancefield group A antigen), S.dysgalactiae is PYR-negative and Bacitracin resistant. The distinction from the Streptococcus anginosus group (Lancefield A, C, G or F) {{can be made by}} colony size and Voges Proskauer test (VP); the S.anginosus group being VP positive. Streptococcus equi contains Lancefield group C, and Streptococcus canis harbours group G, but unlike S.dysgalactiae, they are both <b>Hyaluronidase</b> negative.|$|E
50|$|DNA {{sequencing}} {{analysis revealed}} genes encoding a complement of glycosidases, which include <b>hyaluronidases,</b> two sialidases, three β-galactosidases, α-amylase (glycogenase), and two glycosyltransferases. M. alligatoris differs from {{other species of}} the Mycoplasma genus by the aforementioned complement of sialidases, which are enzymes of the hydrolase class.|$|R
40|$|Hyaluronan is {{a matrix}} polymer {{prominent}} in tissues undergoing rapid growth, development, and repair, in embryology and during malignant progression. It reaches 107 Daltons in size but also exists in fragmented forms with size-specific actions. It has intracellular forms whose functions are less well known. Hyaluronan occurs in all vertebrate tissues with 50 % present in skin. Hyaluronan provides a scaffold on which sulfated proteoglycans and matrix proteins are organized. These supramolecular structures {{are able to}} entrap water and ions to provide tissues with hydration and turgor. Hyaluronan is recognized by membrane receptors that trigger intracellular signaling pathways regulating proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Cell responses are often dependent on polymer size. Catabolic turnover occurs by <b>hyaluronidases</b> and by free radicals, though proportions between these have not been determined. New aspects of hyaluronan biology have recently become realized: involvement in autophagy, in the pathology of diabetes., the ability to modulate immune responses through effects on T regulatory cells and, in its fragmented forms, {{by being able to}} engage several toll-like receptors. It is also apparent that hyaluronan synthases and <b>hyaluronidases</b> are regulated at many more levels than previously realized, and that the several <b>hyaluronidases</b> have functions in addition to their enzymatic activities...|$|R
30|$|The OA joint is {{characterized}} by catabolic processes that degrade both the HA backbone of the aggregate and the core protein of the aggrecan molecules, so impairing aggrecan function and predisposing the articular cartilage to erosion. Such degradation is associated with proteinases, <b>hyaluronidases</b> and free radicals.|$|R
25|$|Proteins {{constitute}} 90-95% of venom's {{dry weight}} {{and they are}} responsible for almost all of its biological effects. Among hundreds, even thousands of proteins found in venom, there are toxins, neurotoxins in particular, as well as nontoxic proteins (which also have pharmacological properties), and many enzymes, especially hydrolytic ones. Enzymes (molecular weight 13-150 KDa) make-up 80-90% of viperid and 25-70% of elapid venoms: digestive hydrolases, L-amino acid oxidase, phospholipases, thrombin-like pro-coagulant, and kallikrein-like serine proteases and metalloproteinases (hemorrhagins), which damage vascular endothelium. Polypeptide toxins (molecular weight 5-10 KDa) include cytotoxins, cardiotoxins, and postsynaptic neurotoxins (such as α-bungarotoxin and α-Cobratoxin), which bind to acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions. Compounds with low molecular weight (up to 1.5 KDa) include metals, peptides, lipids, nucleosides, carbohydrates, amines, and oligopeptides, which inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and potentiate bradykinin (BPP). Inter- and intra-species variation in venom chemical composition is geographical and ontogenic. Phosphodiesterases interfere with the prey's cardiac system, mainly to lower the blood pressure. Phospholipase A2 causes hemolysis by lysing the phospholipid cell membranes of red blood cells. Amino acid oxidases and proteases are used for digestion. Amino acid oxidase also triggers some other enzymes and is responsible for the yellow colour of the venom of some species. <b>Hyaluronidase</b> increases tissue permeability to accelerate absorption of other enzymes into tissues. Some snake venoms carry fasciculins, like the mambas (Dendroaspis), which inhibit cholinesterase to make the prey lose muscle control.|$|E
500|$|The jack jumper ant and its {{relatives}} in the genus Myrmecia {{are among the most}} dangerous ant genera and have fearsome reputations for their extreme aggression; Guinness World Records certifies the ant Myrmecia pyriformis as the world's most dangerous ant. The jack jumper have been compared to other highly aggressive ant species, such as [...] Brachyponera chinensis, Brachyponera sennaarensis, and the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta). The retractable sting is located in their abdomen, attached to a single venom gland connected by the venom sac, which is where the venom is accumulated. Exocrine glands are known in jack jumpers, which produce the venom compounds later used to inject into their victims. Their venom contains haemolytic and eicosanoid elements and histamines. It contains a range of active ingredients and enzymatic activity, which includes phospholipase A2 and B, <b>hyaluronidase,</b> acid and alkaline phosphatase. The venom of the ant also contains several peptides; one being pilosulin 1, which causes cytotoxic effects, pilosulin 2, which has antihypertensive properties and pilosulin 3, which is known to be a major allergen. Other pilosulins include pilosulin 4 and pilosulin 5. The peptides have known molecular weights. The LD50 (lethal dose) occurs at a lower concentration than for melittin, a peptide found in bee venom. Its LD50 value is 3.6 mg/kg (injected intravenously in mice).|$|E

40|$|Failure of remyelination {{is largely}} {{responsible}} for sustained neurologic symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS). MS lesions contain hyaluronan deposits that inhibit oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) maturation. However, the mechanism behind this inhibition is unclear. We report here that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2) is expressed by oligodendrocytes and is up-regulated in MS lesions. Pathogen-derived TLR 2 agonists, but not agonists for other TLRs, inhibit OPC maturation in vitro. Hyaluronan-mediated inhibition of OPC maturation requires TLR 2 and MyD 88, a TLR 2 adaptor molecule. Ablated expression of TLR 2 also enhances remyelination in a lysolecithin animal model. <b>Hyaluronidases</b> expressed by OPCs degrade hyaluronan to hyaluronan oligomers, a requirement for hyaluronan/TLR 2 signaling. MS lesions contain both TLR 2 + oligodendrocytes and low-molecular-weight hyaluronan, consistent with their importance to remyelination in MS.

2500|$|Infiltration {{occurs when}} an IV fluid or {{medication}} accidentally enters the surrounding tissue {{rather than the}} vein. It may occur when the vein itself ruptures (the elderly are particularly prone to fragile veins due to a paucity of supporting tissues), when the vein is damaged during insertion of the intravascular access device, when the device is not sited correctly, from increased vein porosity or when the entry point of the device into the vein becomes {{the path of least}} resistance (e.g. if a cannula is in a vein for some time, the vein may scar and close and the only way for fluid to leave is along the outside of the cannula where it enters the vein). Infiltration is an inadvertent administration of a nonvesicant solution/drug into the tissue, which happens so often when the tourniquet isn't removed in a timely fashion. [...] Infiltration is characterized by coolness and pallor to the skin as well as localized swelling or edema. It is treated by removing the intravenous access device and elevating the affected limb so that the collected fluids can drain away. Sometimes injections of <b>hyaluronidase</b> can be used to speed the dispersal of the fluid/drug. Infiltration is one of the most common adverse effects of IV therapy and is usually not serious unless the infiltrated fluid is a medication damaging to the surrounding tissue, most commonly a vesicant or chemotherapeutic agent, in which case it is called extravasation and extensive necrosis can occur.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hyaluronidases</b> (HYALs) {{comprise}} {{a group of}} enzymes that degrade hyaluronic acid (HA). In this report, we reveal that a single intranasal inoculation of HYAL induces an increase in mononuclear cells within the bronchoalveolar space demonstrating a mesenchymal-like phenotype, expressing stem cell antigen- 1 (SCA- 1), CD 44 and CD 73 but not CD 34, CD 45, CD 3, CD 4, CD 8 or CD 19. This influx of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) -like cells was dependent on leukotriene production within the lung parenchyma. These findings prompted experiments demonstrating that HYAL treatment potently blocked bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis while decreasing transforming growth factor (TGF) -b production and collagen deposition.
