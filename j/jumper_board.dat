On March 1, 2012 Jumper become SAIC's CEO and was essential in splitting the company into two. After the split Jumper remained the CEO {{of the company}} which {{changed its name to}} Leidos. Jumper retired as CEO in July 2014, when Roger Krone succeeded him as the company's new CEO, but Jumper stayed on as chairman of the company's board of directors.|$|R
5000|$|On {{printed circuit}} boards the marking [...] "JP1" [...] is a common {{abbreviation}} of [...] "Jumper 1", i.e. the first (and for most remotes, the only) <b>jumper</b> on the <b>board.</b> Later models are labeled [...] "JP1.x", where [...] "x" [...] is 1, 2, or 3, {{depending on the type}} of processor used.|$|R

I/O is managed by a Motorola 6850 ACIA. This allows a full RS-232 port to be implemented, {{with the addition of}} a few extra components and minor modifications to existing <b>jumpers</b> on the <b>board.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{ground plane}} is a {{continuous}} conducting sheet, usually copper, which forms the bottom layer of a RF circuit board’s foundation. If you envision signals traveling in An RF board as propagating waves, it’s {{easy to understand}} {{the need for a}} ground plane. It forms the continuous common reference for propagation and impedance throughout the board. Those with experience prototyping audio and low speed digital circuits are no doubt familiar with the standard <b>jumper</b> <b>boards</b> with binding posts for power connections. Don’t use these for RF! Although they contain ground pins or traces, they lack the continuous conducting ground plane sheet which is essential at radio frequencies. And, their multi pin structure contains a host of unwanted stray reactances which can spell disaster at frequencies above a few MHz. Substrate The substrate forms the middle layer in the foundation. It can be made from a variety of dielectric materials, depending on the board’s intended frequency range and application. At {{the low end of the}} frequency and price range are fiberboard (G 10) and fiber epoxy series (FR 4) commercial board materials generally usable up to about 1 GHz, above which dielectric losses increase rapidly. Duroid and other trade name microwave board materials are usable at higher frequencies (and prices). Conductor The top layer of the board contains the copper traces that connect circuit elements. Layout and interconnection of these traces is critical at radio frequencies since every trace is a transmission line and every pad contains some inductance or capacitance-whether intended or otherwise. The importance of proper board layout is one of the key differences between low frequency and RF prototyping. Fig. 1. This type of plug board is suitable for prototyping bias networks and audio amplifiers. Don’t try to use it for RF. Signal Routin...|$|R

5000|$|The Tandy 1000 SL and SL/2 feature an Intel 8086 {{processor}} {{running at}} 8 MHz. The SL came with 384 KB of RAM preinstalled, whereas the SL/2 offered 512 KB. Both machines could {{be expanded to}} 640 KB, although the graphics controller reserved a portion of this memory, yielding only 608 KB available the operating system, even on systems using add-in ISA graphic cards. The SL line had the mic/earphone ports, volume knob and reset button on a small satellite board, which had an LM386 audio power amplifier, a microphone input IC and a few small passives. There was also a <b>jumper</b> on the <b>board</b> to change the microphone input to a line-level output. The SL series offered five 8-bit XT-compatible ISA slots, and did not come with pre-installed real-time clock chips, making them optional upgrades {{in the form of}} the plug-in Dallas DS1216E SmartWatch. The CPU could be replaced with NEC's V30 processor for a further increase in performance.|$|R
50|$|Chronologically {{the next}} machine {{dating from the}} late 1960s and early 1970s was the Alpha 8, an eight bit machine, and Alpha 16 which merely doubled up this concept to make a 16-bit machine. Both were built using DTL and TTL devices. The {{processor}} for the Alpha 8 and Alpha 16 each comprised three full sized circuit boards about 18 inches square, {{then there were the}} memory options, 4k, 8k and rarely 16k magnetic core full cards. There were number of options for data input, paper tape via a board called the utility controller which could also be used to drive other devices such as printers, etc. There was a magnetic tape controller which was a full card and a Winchester interface disk controller which was two full cards with a circuit <b>board</b> <b>jumper</b> which interlinked the two cards. The programmers console had a row of toggle switches for data entry of bootstrap routines, etc. Two chassis were available, standard and jumbo with separate power supplies. There was a variety of other cards are available for various forms of input output and process control, relay cards, dual teletype cards, etc.|$|R
