50|$|The de Havilland Engine Company Limited had the de Havilland Sprite {{which was}} a rocket engine with a {{military}} type test certificate. In 1954, the company had produced the axial turbojet Gyron of 30,000 lbf kN thrust, from which was descended the Gyron Junior series. The de Havilland Engine Company's portfolio included the (licensed) Gnome turboshaft.The Blackburn Aeroplane and Motor Company had entered the aero engine field in 1934 when the Cirrus-Hermes Engineering Company {{became part of the}} Blackburn and this became the Engine Division of Blackburn Aircraft and subsequently Blackburn Engines Limited. In 1952 an agreement was signed which enabled Blackburn Engines Limited to produce engines based on the Turbomeca range of small gas turbine engines. These were developed for use as airborne auxiliary power units for large aircraft and they were also used as a <b>ground</b> <b>starter</b> unit in the British services.|$|E
40|$|Feed {{processing}} {{can affect}} rumen development in new born calves, and potentially define animal performance. Two feed management systems, extruded starter (Ruter) with possible early weaning and <b>ground</b> <b>starter</b> (control), were evaluated in thirty-two Holstein calves (16 females and 16 males). Animals {{were randomly assigned}} to the treatments using a randomized block design with birth weight as a covariate. They were weaned when starter intake reached 800 g for two consecutive days. Twenty-one days after the weaning, males were slaughtered and the stomach compartments were isolated. Rumen and omasum fragments were processed for morphological evaluation. Animal performance, clinical condition and stomach compartment weight did not differ between the treatments (P> 0. 05), despite weaning weight of animals receiving extruded starter being 5. 68 % higher than the control animals. Extruded starter stimulated cell proliferation of the ruminal epithelium (P < 0. 05), but did not affect the dimensions of the papillary rumen and omasum mitotic index (MI). The Ruter feeding system was potentially beneficial for weight gain and morphofunctional rumen development in lactating animals; however, this treatment did not allow early weaning as proposed by the feeding system...|$|E

5000|$|His only Major League {{appearance}} {{took place}} on July 22, 1887, when the Philadelphia Athletics signed him from the Reading club to pitch {{in a game against}} the Cleveland Blues at Jefferson Street <b>Grounds.</b> Facing Blues <b>starter</b> Mike Morrison, Chapman gave up six runs in the first five innings. The game ended in unusual fashion, as Morrison declared a forfeit in the sixth inning with the Blues leading by two runs following a heated argument with an umpire. [...] As a result, Chapman is credited with a complete game, but not a win. Overall, in his five innings of work, he gave up eight hits, four earned runs and six runs total, two walks, and four strikeouts. As a batter, he did not collect a hit in two at-bats.|$|R
40|$|Vegetable oil can be {{produced}} from a perennial plant such as coconut (Cocos nucifera L.). There are few techniques for coconut oil extraction, such as physical, chemical, and fermentative processes. The fermentation process uses microbial inoculum as <b>starter.</b> <b>Ground</b> coconut meat was soaked in warm water, than squeezed several times to get coconut milk. After being allowed to stand for 4 - 5 hours, it separated into two layers, cream and skim. Starter was prepared from a mixture of milk and coconut water (1 : 9, v/v) which enriched with 2 % tomato extract, 0. 5 % urea, and 1. 0 % molasses and then preincubated for 5 days under agitation. Starter with different concentration (1. 0; 2. 5; 5. 0; and 10 %) were added onto coconut milk and allowed to be fermented for over night. The extracting oil was analyzed for further experiment, especially, on its antibacterial activity. The maximum yield of 23 % was achieved by using 2. 5 % starter. Total protein, fat, FFA, and cholesterol content of the fermented coconut oil were 0. 05 %, 96. 45 %, 0. 29 %, and 0. 008 %, respectively. The gas chromatogram showed that this oil contained high lauric acid (46. 20 %), and 13. 94 % miristic, 5. 97 % palmitic, 9. 00 % palmitoleic, and 19. 73 % stearic acid, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} form of starter grain (coarse versus ground) and {{inclusion}} of {{various levels of}} hay on rumen development was evaluated. Two experiments were conducted {{to determine the effect}} of form of diet and forage inclusion on intake, growth, feed efficiency and weaning age in dairy calves. Diets consisted of commercial coarse starter (C), <b>ground</b> <b>starter</b> (G), coarse starter with 7. 5 % bromegrass hay of consistent particle size (8 - 19 mm) (H 1), and coarse starter with 15 % hay (H 2). In experiment 1, intake was held constant across treatments until weaning, when feed was offered ad libitum. Calves receiving H 1 and H 2 were heavier, had greater body weight gain and greater feed efficiency than calves receiving C. There were no differences in intake. Total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations were higher and the proportion of acetate was lower for calves fed G versus C. In experiment 2, calves (n = 56) were offered diets on an ad libitum basis and weaned according to intake. There were no differences in body weight gain, average daily gain, feed efficiency and age at weaning with respect to treatment. Starter and total dry matter intake tended to be greater in calves fed H 1 and H 2 versus C. Addition of controlled particle size hay to diets of young calves appears to favorably alter rumen environment resulting in increased intake and improved feed efficiency. Forage of a consistent particle size can be successfully utilized in starter rations of young calves...|$|E
40|$|Consumption {{of solid}} feed is {{essential}} for successful transition from a preruminant to a functional ruminant animal. Calves fed starter rations containing highly fermentable carbohydrates often experience dramatic changes in concentrations of rumen and blood metabolites. The optimal amount of roughage required in the diet of young calves is still unclear. The objective of these studies {{was to determine the}} effect of form of diet and the inclusion of various levels of hay of consistent particle size on rumen development and immune function in young calves. In experiments 1 and 2, calves were fed one of four treatments. Diets consisted of coarse starter (C), <b>ground</b> <b>starter</b> (G), coarse starter with 7. 5 % grass hay of consistent particle size (H 1), and coarse starter with 15 % grass hay of consistent particle size (H 2). When intake was restricted prior to weaning, calves consuming H 1 and H 2 tended to have greater body weight. Calves receiving H 1 and H 2 also had greater average daily gain (ADG) and feed efficiency (GF) postweaning. Intake of dry matter did not differ by treatment. Total ruminal VFA concentrations were higher in calves consuming G versus C. Acetate to propionate ratio was higher in calves fed H 2 than H 1. In experiment 2, calves received access to feed ad libitum. There was a tendency for calves offered H 1 and H 2 to consume more starter and total dry matter than those fed C. There were no differences in body weight, ADG, GF, or age at weaning. In experiment 3 calves were offered spray-dried animal plasma (SDAP) or red blood cells and whey protein concentrate (RBCW) in addition to coarse and ground diets in experiment 1. Calves receiving diets supplemented with SDAP were heavier. Changes in white blood cell populations were also observed, although it is doubtful these changes are of physiological significance because the values did not differ from normal ranges. It appears that the use of forage of a consistent particle size does encourage intake of solid feed and promotes more efficient gain. The use of hay in the starter diet appears to create a more stable rumen environment for the calf...|$|E
