5|$|Far {{from being}} <b>extinct,</b> <b>in</b> {{recent years the}} Carménère grape has been {{discovered}} to be thriving in several areas outside France. In Chile, growers almost inadvertently preserved the grape variety during the last 150 years, due largely to its similarity to Merlot.|$|E
5|$|The Choristodera, a {{generally}} crocodile-like group of uncertain phylogeny (possibly archosaurian) also survived the event, only to become <b>extinct</b> <b>in</b> the Miocene.

5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is {{native to}} Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Angola. Today it is <b>extinct</b> <b>in</b> Malawi, but has been successfully reintroduced into Namibia.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} is, however, gradually decreasing due to habitat loss, {{caused by}} expanding human settlements and poaching for its superior meat. As they are docile and inactive {{most of the}} time, they can easily be killed. The species became <b>extinct</b> <b>in</b> Swaziland and Zimbabwe, but has been reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|The present genera of Alcelaphinae {{appeared}} in the Pliocene. The extinct Alcelaphine genus Paramularius, {{that was the same}} in size as the hartebeest, is believed to have come into being in the Pliocene, but became <b>extinct</b> <b>in</b> the middle Pleistocene. Several genera of Hippotraginae are known since the Pliocene and Pleistocene. This subfamily appears to have diverged from the Alcelaphinae {{in the latter part of}} early Miocene. The Bovinae are believed to have diverged from the rest of the Bovidae in the early Miocene. The Boselaphini became <b>extinct</b> <b>in</b> Africa in the early Pliocene; their latest fossils were excavated in Langebaanweg (South Africa) and Lothagam (Kenya).|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s, the kakapo was <b>extinct</b> <b>in</b> the North Island and {{its range}} and {{numbers in the}} South Island were declining. One of its last refuges was rugged Fiordland.
