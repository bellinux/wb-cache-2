5|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} metal arc welding (SMAW); it is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMA) or stick welding.

The electrode core itself acts as <b>filler</b> material, making a separate <b>filler</b> unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding <b>filler</b> metal. The <b>filler</b> rod is {{withdrawn from the}} weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. <b>Filler</b> rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain {{some distance from the}} arc while staying inside the gas shield. If held too close to the arc, the <b>filler</b> rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle. As the weld nears completion, the arc current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks {{at the end of the}} weld.|$|E
5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the <b>filler</b> metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the <b>filler</b> metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat.

5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal.

40|$|Background: Semi-permanent <b>fillers</b> {{are among}} the most {{favorable}} <b>fillers</b> on the market.

Objective: To compare the two semi-permanent <b>fillers</b> Poly-L-Lactic Acid (PLLA) and calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) in reference to the aesthetic result, patient satisfaction and side effects. Methods: Studies on side effects, patient satisfaction and aesthetic results after augmentation with semi-permanent <b>fillers</b> were analyzed. Results: Semi-permanent <b>fillers</b> seem excellently suited for the augmentation of very deep wrinkles particularly in {{the lower half of the}} face. In general, high patient satisfaction can be determined with both <b>fillers.</b> Here, the effect from the polylactic acid can be verified for up to two years while no effect could be verified already after one year in a ma-jority of the patients augmented with CaHA. Short-term side effects such as bleedings or erythema in the region of the augmented area have been observed in both <b>fillers</b> during augmentation. The incidence of nodules and granulomas seems significantly higher in augmentations with PLLA compared to CaHA.

40|$|Concrete with a {{low carbon}} dioxide {{footprint}} (LCDF) contains less cementitious materials (CM) than ordinary concrete and hence less cementitious paste. Besides the reduced carbon dioxide footprint, LCDF concrete offers other advantages such as reduced cost as well as improved dimensional stability due to reduced hydration heat, creep and shrinkage. Nevertheless, decreasing the quantity of CM has {{a negative impact on}} concrete workability. To restore workability, multi-sized <b>fillers</b> are advocated to replace aggregates and CM. Generally, <b>fillers</b> can improve the packing density of concrete due to the filling effect and thus more excess water or paste is available to facilitate spread and flow rate. Two types of <b>fillers</b> were examined in this study – limestone with particles smaller than 75 μm and foundry sand with particles of 75 – 400 μm. The particles of these two <b>fillers</b> are respectively similar and larger in size when compared with cement. Concrete mixes with no <b>fillers</b> and with mono- or multi-sized <b>fillers</b> were prepared and tested for flowability and strength. The results indicate that more superplasticiser is needed to achieve the same flowability when <b>fillers</b> are added.

40|$|Background: Dermal <b>fillers</b> {{are gaining}} {{popularity}} for rapid aesthetic improvement. Long-term efficacy and safety {{have not been}} well documented. The aim of this systematic review {{was to assess the}} safety and efficacy of injectable dermal <b>fillers</b> compared with other facial augmentation techniques for the management of age-related lines and wrinkles. Methods: Studies including patients receiving injectable semi-permanent or permanent dermal <b>fillers</b> for age-related lines and wrinkles were included in this review. Efficacy outcomes (including changes in skin thickness and patient satisfaction) and safety outcomes (including mortality, lumps and infections) were examined. Results: Three randomized control trials and six case series were included. Permanent and semi-permanent dermal <b>fillers</b> improved subjective ratings of appearance and resulted in higher patient satisfaction than temporary <b>fillers.</b> Long-term efficacy appeared good in the few studies that reported it. Short-term safety appeared favourable. Lumps were reported in all but one study but received little follow-up. Long-term safety data were limited. Conclusions: The treatment of age-related lines and wrinkles with permanent and semi-permanent dermal <b>fillers</b> is more efficacious compared with temporary <b>fillers</b> in those studies that compared them. Case series evidence suggests that these <b>fillers</b> achieve their objective, which is to decrease the visible effects of age-related changes.

30|$|Injectable <b>fillers</b> {{are widely}} used for facial rejuvenation, {{correction}} of disabling volumetric fat loss in HIV-associated facial lipoatrophy, Romberg disease, and post-traumatic facial disfiguring. The {{purpose of this article}} is to acquaint the reader with the anatomy of facial fat compartments, as well as with the properties and key imaging features of commonly used facial <b>fillers,</b> filler-related complications, interpretation pitfalls, and dermatologic conditions mimicking filler-related complications. The distribution of facial <b>fillers</b> is characteristic and depends on the anatomy of the superficial fat compartments. Silicone has signature MRI features, calcium hydroxyapatite has characteristic calcifications, whereas other injectable <b>fillers</b> have overlapping imaging features. Most <b>fillers</b> (hyaluronic acid, collagen, and polyalkylimide–polyacrylamide hydrogels) have signal intensity patterns compatible with high water content. On PET-CT, most <b>fillers</b> show physiologic high FDG uptake, which should not be confounded with pathology. Abscess, cellulitis, non-inflammatory nodules, and foreign body granulomas are the most common filler-related complications, and imaging can help in the differential diagnosis. Diffusion weighted imaging helps in detecting a malignant lesion masked by injected facial <b>fillers.</b> Awareness of imaging features of facial <b>fillers</b> and their complications helps to avoid misinterpretation of MRI, and PET-CT scans and facilitates therapeutic decisions in unclear clinical cases.|$|R
