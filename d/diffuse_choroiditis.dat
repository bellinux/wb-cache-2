40|$|Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) {{syndrome}} is an uncommon acute ophthalmological disorder, characterised by bilateral serous retinal detachment with <b>diffuse</b> <b>choroiditis,</b> {{in association with}} specific extra-ocular manifestations. We describe a patient with unequivocal VKH syndrome arising 49 days after matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation (BMT) performed as treatment for severe aplastic anaemia. The visual symptoms and retinal changes responded well to corticosteroids. The haematological relevance of VKH {{syndrome is}} to distinguish it from retinitis due to cytomegalovirus, which requires different therapy and has a far worse visual prognosis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
30|$|The {{diagnostic}} algorithm was as follows: first, uveitis was diagnosed, categorized, and graded {{according to}} the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature Working Group criteria [[6]]. Specifically, uveitis was classified in terms of anatomic localization, namely: (a) anterior (iritis, iridocyclitis, and anterior cyclitis); (b) intermediate (pars planitis, posterior cyclitis, and hyalitis); (c) posterior (focal, multifocal, or <b>diffuse</b> <b>choroiditis,</b> chorioretinitis, retinochoroiditis, retinitis, and neuroretinitis); (d) panuveitis (inflammation of the anterior chamber, vitreous, and retina or choroid). In addition, uveitis was categorized as acute, chronic, or recurrent according to its course, whether it was unilateral or bilateral, or granulomatous or non-granulomatous. The four aspects of intraocular inflammation (anterior chamber cells, anterior chamber flare, vitreous cells, and vitreous haze or debris) were ranked using an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4 + [[6]]. Second, patients were investigated for infectious etiologies, including tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, borreliosis, rickettsial infections, toxocariasis, herpes zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and rubella. Patients who tested positive {{for any of these}} conditions were excluded.|$|E
30|$|Bilateral intraocular {{inflammation}} with exudative retinal detachment is {{a hallmark}} clinical feature of VKH {{disease in the}} acute stage [1, 2, 4, 5]. However, this entity may be misdiagnosed as acute CSC, particularly in cases presenting with bilateral neurosensory detachments and PEDs [7, 8]. The pathophysiology of the two conditions is different since VKH is primarily a <b>diffuse</b> stromal <b>choroiditis</b> with secondary involvement of the choriocapillaris, whereas as CSC occurs a result of choroidal vascular hyperpermeability. Typically, these entities can be differentiated {{on the basis of}} history, clinical features, and ancillary investigations like FA, ICGA, and EDI-OCT. In a series reported by Yang et al. [16], 22 % of patients with VKH were initially misdiagnosed as CSC. Another study by Shin et al. [7] reports 14.3 % of VKH cases misdiagnosed due to absence of cellular inflammatory reaction or typical features such as sub-retinal septae and RPE folds on EDI-OCT in these eyes.|$|R
50|$|In the US {{corticotropin}} is used {{to treat}} epileptic spasms in infants, acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults; acute episodes of psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis; in acute exacerbations or as maintenance therapy for the collagen disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic dermatomyositis; for skin conditions like severe erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome; for serum sickness; for severe acute and chronic allergic and inflammatory processes involving the eye such as keratitis, iritis, iridocyclitis, <b>diffuse</b> posterior uveitis, <b>choroiditis,</b> optic neuritis, chorioretinitis, and anterior segment inflammation; sarcoidosis in the lungs; and to treat edema in certain nephrotic syndromes.|$|R
40|$|OCULAR lesions {{are seen}} in 10 to 20 per cent. of cases of polyarteritis nodosa and the {{ophthalmic}} findings may sometimes be {{the only means of}} establishing the diagnosis. The ocular lesions may include bilateral optic atrophy, <b>diffuse</b> <b>choroiditis,</b> retinal detachment, iritis, bilateral embolism of the central retinal artery, and perforating necrosis of the sclera. Posterior segment changes may involve either the choroid or the retina. The choroidal lesions are due to involvement of the posterior ciliary arteries. The retinal involvement may also be secondary to hypertension when the kidneys are affected by the pathological process (Duguid, 1954; Ballantyne and Michaelson, 1962). Choroidal vessel changes consist chiefly of fibrinoid degeneration leading to total occlusion (Boeck, 1965). Sometimes there may be scattered foci of non-granuloma-tous uveitis (Blodi and Sullivan, 1959). In the following case, which illustrates some of these features, the diagnosis was made more difficult by false positive serological tests for syphilis...|$|E
