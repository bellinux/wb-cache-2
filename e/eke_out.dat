25|$|After the Chief's death, {{the tribe}} kept the {{identity}} of the next chief a close secret for many years to avoid notice by unscrupulous neighbors.

25|$|McDonald strongly, {{actively}} {{and openly}} disliked Reuther. He opposed Reuther's plans {{to undertake a}} new wave of organizing and pushed for stronger support of mainstream Democrats rather than left-wing candidates. McDonald believed that the conservative trend in American politics indicated labor should retrench rather than expand aggressively. At the CIO convention in December 1952, McDonald nominated Allan S. Haywood, the CIO's 64-year-old director of organizing, as president. McDonald was supported by most of the CIO's independent local unions and Industrial Union Councils (the CIO's local central labor bodies). Reuther promised to create the office of executive vice-president and appoint Haywood to the position, a move with allowed him to <b>eke</b> <b>out</b> a win, with 54 to 48 percent of the vote.|$|E
25|$|The early {{administrators of}} the colony at Sydney Cove sent groups of prisoners to an area nearby, named The Rocks, to <b>eke</b> <b>out</b> what ever {{existence}} they could from the land and build housing for themselves. These first occupants hewed out sandstone from the outcrops and built simple houses. Convicts were also employed tunnelling through {{what is called the}} 'Argyle Cut' in The Rocks. The rock was dumped in the mangrove swamps {{at the head of the}} Tank Stream to begin to make Circular Quay. Later development in The Rocks area led to bond stores and warehouses being built on the bay, with better housing and pubs for entertainment. Millions of cubic feet of sandstone was excavated from Sydney's Cockatoo Island to create a dry dock on the island.|$|E

Robert McAlmon, and Maria and Eugene Jolas came to Paris and published their literary magazine Transition. Harry Crosby and his wife Caresse would establish the Black Sun Press in Paris in 1927, publishing works by such future luminaries as D. H.

25|$|In {{front of}} a crowd of about 1,000 people at Centurion – usually figures more {{associated}} with domestic cricket matches – Africa won {{the first of three}} ODIs. The African side included ten South Africans and two Kenyans – and one of the Kenyans was substituted for a South African without getting the chance to bat. Zaheer Khan made early breakthroughs as Africa collapsed to 57 for 5 – Justin Ontong and Steve Tikolo both dismissed for ducks – but Ashwell Prince and Mark Boucher set Africa back on the right track with an 86-run partnership. Prince finished on 78 not out as he ran out of partners to bat with, Africa eventually being dismissed for 198. Asia, however, lost wickets at regular intervals, but a 24-run ninth-wicket partnership between Zaheer Khan and Shoaib Akhtar looked to turn it Asia's way. Asia needed to <b>eke</b> <b>out</b> five runs for the last wicket, with twenty-two balls to spare, but Ashish Nehra was bowled by a straight delivery from ODI debutant Dale Steyn, and Asia finished two runs short of victory.|$|E
25|$|The {{final blow}} {{may have come}} when the {{favorable}} agricultural conditions during the Holocene climatic optimum, which lasted from 7000 to 3200 B.C., quite suddenly changed, resulting in the arid Sub-Boreal phase, which created the worst and longest drought in Europe {{since the end of}} the last Ice Age. The large Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements, which relied entirely on subsistence agriculture for support, would have faced very nasty Dust Bowl conditions, making it impossible to continue their way of life. It is theorized that the combination of this drought and the existence of neighboring nomadic pastoralist tribes led to the complete collapse of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, and the abandonment of their settlements, as members of the culture left behind the plow to take up the saddle of a nomad, as pastoralists are better equipped to <b>eke</b> <b>out</b> a living in an arid environment. The results were that by 2750 B.C. the Proto-Indo-European culture completely dominated the area. The primitive trade network of the Cucuteni-Trypillia society that had been slowly growing more complex was thus abruptly ended, along with the culture that supported it. Or, rather, it was supplanted by another more advanced trade network as the Proto-Indo-Europeans moved in to take the land, and to bring with them an entirely new society with division of labor, a ruling and religious elite, social stratification, and, in a word, civilization.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} batting in {{partnership}} {{becomes even more}} vital once only one recognised quality batsman remains. His job is then to shepherd the tail-end batsmen, while attempting to <b>eke</b> <b>out</b> as many runs as possible, or simply to survive {{as long as possible}} when merely attempting to save the game. This usually involves attempting to minimise risk, by exposing the lesser batsmen to as little bowling as possible. To do this, boundaries and twos are preferred while singles are avoided in the early parts of an over (although this allows the fielding captain to set his field further back into a more defensive position, often tempting the batsman with an easy single) but because the bowling end changes {{at the end of an}} over, it is necessary to score a single (or much more rarely, three runs) to counteract this. While a single on the sixth and final ball of the over would be ideal, the field is usually set closer to make this harder and the batsman may prefer to rotate the strike on the fifth or even fourth ball, hoping that the tail-ender can survive for a delivery or two, rather than risking either having to take a dangerous run on the last ball (with the attendant risk of a run out) or not being able to get a single at all, leaving the tail-ender stranded on strike for the start of the next over (hence allowing up to six balls to be bowled at him).|$|E
500|$|In 1992, {{a team of}} {{archaeologists and}} {{forensic}} anthropologists identified a site, which they referenced as [...] "NgLj-2", on the western shores of King William Island. The site matches the physical description of Leopold McClintock's [...] "boat place". Excavations there uncovered nearly 400 bones and bone fragments, and physical artefacts ranging from pieces of clay pipes to buttons and brass fittings. Examination of these bones by Anne Keenleyside, the expedition's forensic scientist, showed elevated levels of lead and many cut-marks [...] "consistent with de-fleshing". On {{the basis of this}} expedition, it has become generally accepted that at least some groups of Franklin's men resorted to cannibalism in their final distress. [...] On 18 June 2015, a study accepted for publication in the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology concluded that in addition to the de-fleshing of bones, 35 [...] "bones had signs of breakage and 'pot polishing,' which occurs when the ends of bones heated in boiling water rub against the cooking pot they are placed in", which [...] "typically occurs in the end stage of cannibalism, when starving people extract the marrow to <b>eke</b> <b>out</b> the last bit of calories and nutrition they can." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Bioscope from December 22, 1910. It states: [...] "Max, an old musician, {{finds it hard to}} support his two motherless daughters, one of whom is blind, and the professor takes great pride in his daughter's musical education. The little one sings and the blind girl plays upon the violin. But sickness and death overtake the professor, and the orphans find themselves penniless and homeless. They are compelled to sing in the streets, and thus <b>eke</b> <b>out</b> a precarious livelihood. While walking through a fashionable street one day Marie sees the sign of the famous doctor. She calls her blind sister's attention to it, but the girl has no hope that the doctor will see penniless patients. Marie returns {{in time to see the}} doctor alight from his carriage, but the servant refuses to allow the ragged little girl to follow him. Marie conceives the idea of hiding in the doctor's carriage, and when he sets out on his rounds he discovers the terrified little girl. She pleads with him not to be angry, and tells of her sister's affliction. The doctor goes with her to see Violet, and has the stricken girl taken to a hospital, where he operates successfully upon her eyes. Mr. Grey brings Violet to the attention of some charitable women, who see that she does not lack professional engagements. While returning from one of her recitals, Dr. Grey offers to drive her home, and proposes to Violet, and is accepted. Marie is awakened by the sound of a kiss, and is told that she is to have a big brother." ...|$|E
