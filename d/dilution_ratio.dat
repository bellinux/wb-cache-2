40|$|The role of {{dilution}} by artificial {{hard water}} on nanostructures present in body wash samples provided by Procter and Gamble were investigated using time-resolved cryogenic {{transmission electron microscopy}} (cryo-TEM). Samples with and without perfume were examined at 10 X, 20 X, and 50 X dilution. Micellar samples transformed to mostly unilamellar vesicles at 50 X dilution, {{in contrast to the}} micelle to monomer transition seen in typical samples. At lower dilutions, a change in morphology from spherical to wormlike micelles was observed. For lamellar samples, lower <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> show tightly packed multilamellar vesicles, while higher <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> show more dispersed vesicles with less bilayers. Nanostructural transformations upon dilution were attributed to changes in curvature/packing parameters, which occurred due to dilution with hard water and addition of perfume. The systems experience changes in curvature in order to maintain equilibrium.

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} studies {{were made on}} two classes of buoyant jet problems, namely: 1) an inclined, round buoyant jet in a stagnant environment with linear density-stratification; 2) a round buoyant jet in a uniform cross stream of homogeneous density. Using the integral technique of analysis, assuming similarity, predictions can be made for, jet trajectory, widths, and <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios,</b> in a density-stratified or flowing environment. Such information is of great importance {{in the design of}} disposal systems for sewage effluent into the ocean or waste gases into the atmosphere. The present study of a buoyant jet in a stagnant environment has extended the Morton type of analysis to cover the effect of the initial angle of discharge. Numerical solutions have been presented for a range of initial conditions. Laboratory experiments were conducted for photographic observations of the trajectories of dyed jets. In general the observed jet forms agreed well with the calculated trajectories and nominal half widths when the value of the entrainment coefficient was taken to be α = 0. 082, as previously suggested by Morton. The problem of a buoyant jet in a uniform cross stream was analyzed by assuming an entrainment mechanism based upon the vector difference between the characteristic jet velocity and the ambient velocity. The effect of the unbalanced pressure field {{on the sides of the}} jet flow was approximated by a gross drag term. Laboratory flume experiments with sinking jets which are directly analogous to buoyant jets were performed. Salt solutions were injected into fresh water at the free surface in a flume. The jet trajectories, <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> and jet half widths were determined by conductivity measurements. The entrainment coefficient, α, and drag coefficient, Cd, were found from the observed jet trajectories and <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios.</b> In the ten cases studied where jet Froude number ranged from 10 to 80 and velocity ratio (jet: current) k from 4 to 16, a varied from 0. 4 to 0. 5 and Cd from 1. 7 to 0. 1. The jet mixing motion for distances within 250 D was found to be dominated by the self-generated turbulence, rather than the free-stream turbulence.

5000|$|In a lab, the {{determination}} of AOX parameter consists of adsorption of organic halides from the sample on to an activated carbon. The activated carbon can be powdered or granular and adsorbed using microcolumns or a batch process, if the samples are rich in humic acids. Vigorous shaking is often employed {{in the event of}} a batch process to favor the adsorption of organic halide on to the activated carbon due to its electronegativity and presence of lone pairs. The inorganic halides that are also adsorbed are washed away using a strong acid such as nitric acid. The carbon with adsorbed organic halide is obtained by filtration, after which the filter containing the carbon is burnt in the presence of oxygen. While combustion of hydrocarbon part of the compounds form CO2 and H2O, halo acids are formed from the halogens. These haloacids are absorbed into acetic acid. Subsequent use of microcolumetric titration, an electrochemical quantification method, provides the AOX content in the sample. Using the <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio,</b> the total AOX content at the location can be estimated. Alternatively, the chlorinated compounds in the sample can be determined by using pentane extraction followed by capillary gas chromatography and electron capture (GC-ECD).

30|$|Expansion of the {{electrical}} double layer is another mechanism {{which is considered}} an explanation for recovery enhancement. In this mechanism, oil adsorbed on the rock surface is displaced by low salinity water via swelling of {{the electrical}} double layer. In low salinity water, the ionic strength decreases and consequently {{the thickness of the}} electrical double layer increases. Therefore, ion exchange occurs with higher opportunity which results in desorption of oil from the rock surface (Lager et al. 2007). However, there exists an optimum <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> at which the highest oil recovery was obtained. In other words, reducing the salinity of water from a certain value is found to have an inverse effect on the oil production. In this study, it is observed that the highest ultimate oil recovery, 13.9 % IOIP, was obtained at a <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> of 20.

The morphology of the carbon xerogels showed that the size and number of the clusters produced during the sol–gel reaction is not only influenced by the pH but also by the <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio.</b> As with a decrease in the pH value, an increase in the <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> caused {{the formation of}} a small number of large clusters, leading to materials with large pores. However, depending on the values selected the effect of the pH and <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> was enhanced or diminished by the effect of the other.

Experimental repeatability is assessed {{by means of the}} Coefficient of Variation (CoV) from three independent measurements for every test point. A hypothesis test on the difference between total number count before and after the turbine shows that there are statistically relevant variations for most operating points. A reduction in PM total number count at low load is observed, and an increment at high load. It is conjectured that as fuel injection pressure and duration increase with load, a larger share of volatile particulate matter is produced, which then undergoes nucleation as the exhaust gas expands through the turbine. At the same time, the centrifugal action within the turbocharger is believed to promote particle agglomeration and growth, and fragmentation of micro-scale particles. Experiments with variable <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> at a fixed engine test point show that changes in <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> affect repeatability of the emissions measurements only marginally. Yet, a hypothesis test on the variation of total number count with dilution shows that PM number counts are systematically affected by changes in <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio.</b> Furthermore, a hypothesis test also shows that the impact of the turbocharger on total number emissions is statistically relevant regardless of the <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> adopted...|$|E

40|$|In {{prospective}} studies, disease rates during follow-up {{are typically}} analyzed {{with respect to}} the values of factors measured during an initial baseline survey. However, because of "regression dilution," this generally tends to underestimate the real associations of disease rates with the "usual" levels of such risk factors during some particular exposure period. The "regression dilution ratio" describes the ratio of the steepness of the uncorrected association to that of the real association. To assess the relevance of the usual value of a risk factor during particular exposure periods (e. g., first, second, and third decades) to disease risks, regression <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> can be derived by relating baseline measurements of the risk factor to replicate measurements from a reasonably representative sample of study participants after an interval equivalent to about the midpoint of each exposure period (e. g., at 5, 15, and 25 years, respectively). This report illustrates the impact of this time interval on the magnitude of the regression <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> for blood pressure and blood cholesterol. The analyses were based on biennial remeasurements over 30 years for participants in the Framingham Study (Framingham, Massachusetts) and a 26 -year resurvey for a sample of men in the Whitehall Study (London, England). They show that uncorrected associations of disease risk with baseline measurements underestimate the strength of the real associations with usual levels of these risk factors during the first decade of exposure by about one-third, the second decade by about one-half, and the third decade by about two-thirds. Hence, to correct appropriately for regression dilution, replicate measurements of such risk factors may be required at varying intervals after baseline for at least a sample of participants...|$|R

40|$|A {{dilution}} sampler {{was used}} {{to examine the effects of}} <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> and residence time on the particulate emissions from a pilot-scale pulverized coal combustor. Measurements include the particle size distribution from 0. 003 to 2. 5 {micro}m, PM{sub 2. 5 } mass emission rate and PM 2. 5 composition (OC/EC, major ions, and elemental). Hot filter samples were also collected simultaneously in order to compare the dilution sampler measurement with standard stack sampling methodologies such as EPA Method 5. Measurements were made both before and after the bag-house, the particle control device used on the coal combustor. Measurements were made with three different coal types and a coal-biomass blend. The residence time and <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> do not influence the PM{sub 2. 5 } mass emission rate, but have a significant effect on the size distribution and total number emissions. Measurements made before the bag-house showed increasing the residence time dramatically decreases the total particle number concentration, and shifts the particle mass to larger sizes. The effects of residence time can be explained quantitatively by the coagulation of the emitted particles. Measurements made after the bag-house were not affected by coagulation due to the lower concentration of particles. Nucleation of sulfuric acid vapor within the dilution was an important source of ultrafine particles. This nucleation is strongly a function of <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> because of the competition between condensation and nucleation. At low dilution ratios condensation dominates and little nucleation is observed; increasing the <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> promotes nucleation because of the corresponding decrease in available surface area per unit volume for condensation. No nucleation was observed after the bag house where conditions greatly favor nucleation over condensation; we suspect that the bag house removed the SO{sub 3 } in the flue gas. Exhaust SO{sub 3 } levels were not measured during these experiments. Dilution caused the enrichment of selenium, ammonium and sulfate in the PM{sub 2. 5 } emissions compared to the hot filter samples.

Our experimental results reveal that, with the increase of the hydrogen <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> X, the deposition rate Rd and hydrogen content CH are reduced while the crystalline fraction Fc, mean grain size δ and optical bandgap ETauc are increased. In comparison with other plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition methods of nanocrystalline silicon films where a very high hydrogen <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> X is routinely required (e. g. X > 16), we have achieved nanocrystalline silicon films at a very low hydrogen <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1, featuring a high deposition rate of 1. 57 nm/s, a high crystalline fraction of 67. 1 %, a very low hydrogen content of 4. 4 at. %, an optical bandgap of 1. 89 eV, and an almost vertically aligned columnar structure with a mean grain size of approximately 19 nm. We have also shown that a sufficient amount of atomic hydrogen on the growth surface essential for the formation of nanocrystalline silicon is obtained through highly-effective dissociation of silane and hydrogen molecules in the high-density inductively coupled plasmas. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLaser {{deposition}} {{with wire}} offers saving potentials over powder based systems. These include a cleaner processing environment, reduced {{economic and environmental}} cost of producing the wire, better surface finish and higher material deposition rates. This technique is rapidly finding applications for the manufacture and repair of high value components. For the first time, the deposition of Inconel 625 wire for single tracks at varying processing parameters using a 2 -kW Ytterbium doped fibre laser has been investigated. A process map predicting the process characteristics in terms of wire dripping, smooth wire transfer and wire stubbing at different cladding conditions has been developed. Track geometrical characteristics including aspect ratio and contact angle were evaluated using surface profilometry and optical microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy {{was used to determine}} the <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> (%) of the tracks. Wire deposition volume per unit length of track and energy per unit length of track were found to be key parameters influencing both the process and track geometrical characteristics. Aspect ratio and <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> showed positive dependency whereas contact angle showed negative dependency on energy per unit length of track. Conversely, material deposition volume per unit length of track varied directly with contact angle but inversely with aspect ratio and <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> (ranging from 0 % to 24 %). Processing conditions at which a combination of favourable single track properties including low contact angle (< 80 °), minimal <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> (5 – 13 %) and high surface quality were achieved are presented. These properties are required for depositing overlapped tracks of good surface finish, minimal dilution and free of inter-run porosity...|$|E
40|$|Multisolvent {{determination}} of the pH of soils from areas of Nigeria bituminous sand deposits was carried out using the electrometric method to establish the pH of the soils before the commencement of the exploitation of the bituminous sands and also to know the variation of pH of the soils using variable solvents over a range of soil to solvent <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios.</b> Soil sampling was done at two different depths viz., 0 - 50 cm and 50 - 100 cm and the samples were prepared for pH measurements using three commonly recommended solvents viz: distilled water, 0. 01 M and 1 M KCI solutions. The results indicate the soil types are acid soils. This research will also add to the existing exploration data on the study area before the commencement of the exploitation of the natural resources...|$|R
30|$|Concentrations of 24 trace {{elements}} (Ba, Hf, Nb, Rb, Sr, Ta, Th, U, Y, Zr, and 14 {{rare earth elements}} (REEs)) were analyzed for three USGS GRMs (G- 3 granite, AGV- 2 andesite, and BHVO- 2 basalt). Each analysis for the GRM beads was performed as spot (ca. 55  μm diameter) analysis with 120 -s ablation time. The depth-to-diameter ratio of the laser spot was low (< 4) enough to prevent significant elemental fractionation. The NIST 612 glass and 29 Si were employed as the external standard and the internal standard element, respectively. When the middle half of time-integrated data was taken to minimize the fractionation effect, the low-dilution fused glasses yielded reproducible and accurate results for all analyzed elements. In the case of normal-dilution fused glasses, comparable precision and accuracy were obtained only for elements with concentrations higher than 1  μg g− 1, likely resulting from higher <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} diphasic nanocrystalline silicon films and solar cells was {{prepared}} using different hydrogen <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> of silane by {{very high frequency}} plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (VHF-PECVD). It was observed that after light soaking the open circuit voltage (V-oc) of the diphasic solar cells increased, while that of amorphous silicon solar cells decreased. Raman scattering spectroscopy {{was performed on the}} series of diphasic silicon films before and after light soaking. It was found that after light soaking the nanostruclures in the diphasic nanocrystalline silicon films were changed. Both the grain sizes and grain volume fraction reduced, while the grain boundary components increased. These results provide experimental evidence for the conjecture that the light-induced increase in V-oc of the diphasic nanocrystalline solar cells might be induced by the changes in the nanostructure of the intrinsic layer.
