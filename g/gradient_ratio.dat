40|$|Background: Left {{ventricular}} {{end diastolic}} pressure could be estimated collectively using various measures of mitral valve and pulmonary venous flow velocities. In patients with aortic regurgitation, the AR velocity reflects the diastolic pressure {{difference between the}} aorta and the left ventricle. We sought to predict the left ventricular end diastolic pressure by a new Doppler index as aortic regurgitation peak early to late diastolic pressure <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio.</b> Patients and Methods: Fifty three patients with at least moderate aortic regurgitation were enrolled in this study. Physical examination, electrocardiography and echocardiography were performed one day before cardiac catheterization. The severity of AR was graded according to the recommendations of American society for echocardiography. The pressure half time, aortic regurgitation early diastolic velocity, aortic regurgitation early diastolic pressure gradient, aortic regurgitation end diastolic velocity, aortic regurgitation end diastolic pressure gradient, and early diastolic to end diastolic pressure <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> of averaged three beats were measured and recorded. The results from cardiac catheterization and echocardiography were compared. Result: The early diastolic to end diastolic pressure <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> was very accurate (80 %) for determining the left ventricular end diastolic pressure (P = 0. 01). An early diastolic to end diastolic pressure <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 5 has a sensitivity of 96 % and a specificity of 32 % for left ventricular end diastolic pressure ≤ 12 mmHg. The best cutoff value of early diastolic to end diastolic pressure <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> for the prediction of left ventricular end diastolic pressure > 12 mmHg was higher than 2. 0, with a sensitivity of 71 % and specificity of 96 % We found no significant correlation between the left ventricular end diastolic pressure with either left ventricular ejection fraction or aortic regurgitation severity in cardiac catheterization (P = 0. 5). Conclusion: Doppler echocardiography is a viable alternative of cardiac catheterization for determination of the left ventricular end diastolic pressure. The early diastolic to end diastolic pressure <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> is a simple, easy and new method for assessment of the LVEDP in patients with severe chronic aortic regurgitation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT] A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for determining the}} optical thickness of horizontally inhomogeneous clouds from reflected solar radiation measurements. A new parameter of effective gradient is defined as an oblique angle of the plane parallel. Under {{the assumption that the}} effective particle radius of clouds is constant in the cloud layer, the optical thickness and effective gradient of clouds in the independent pixels of satellite scene can be determined from reflection function measurements at weak absorbing wavelength (0. 86 μm) and absorbing wavelength (2. 16 μm). Applying this method to Landsat TM measurements, we recognize that the effective gradient at 0. 86 μm is smaller than at 2. 16 μm and the effective <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> is estimated to be 0. 65 for nadir view with oblique sun (θ_ 0 = 60 °). By applying the effective <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> to the oblique plane parallel model, the analysis provides a good estimate of the optical thickness and effective gradient of cloud. In addition to Landsat TM measurements, an analysis of the forward and backward scattered radiation field of a fractal cloud model is carried out using a Monte Carlo simulations.

Due to its favorable advantages, ACO has been widely used to solve several NP-hard problems, including edge detection.

40|$|A general {{wellbore}} flow model, which incorporates {{not only}} frictional, accelerational and gravitational pressure drops, {{but also the}} pressure drop caused by inflow, is presented in this report. The new wellbore model is readily applicable to any wellbore perforation patterns and well completions, and can be easily incorporated in reservoir simulators or analytical reservoir inflow models. Three dimensionless numbers, the accelerational to frictional pressure <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> R{sub af}, the gravitational to frictional pressure <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> R{sub gf}, and the inflow-directional to accelerational pressure <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> R{sub da}, have been introduced to quantitatively describe {{the relative importance of}} different pressure gradient components. For fluid flow in a production well, it is expected that there may exist up to three different regions of the wellbore: the laminar flow region, the partially-developed turbulent flow region, and the fully-developed turbulent flow region. The laminar flow region is located near the well toe, the partially-turbulent flow region lies {{in the middle of the}} wellbore, while the fully-developed turbulent flow region is at the downstream end or the heel of the wellbore. Length of each region depends on fluid properties, wellbore geometry and flow rate. As the distance from the well toe increases, flow rate in the wellbore increases and the ratios R{sub af} and R{sub da} decrease. Consequently accelerational and inflow-directional pressure drops have the greatest impact in the toe region of the wellbore. Near the well heel the local wellbore flow rate becomes large and close to the total well production rate, here R{sub af} and R{sub da} are small, therefore, both the accelerational and inflow-directional pressure drops can be neglected...|$|E

We aimed {{to determine whether or}} not (i) these changes are present from the earliest clinical stages of multiple sclerosis; (ii) they occur independent of white matter lesions; and (iii) they are associated with subsequent conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis and disability. Seventy-one subjects had MRI scanning a median of 4. 6 months after a clinically isolated optic neuritis (49 females, mean age 33. 5 years) and were followed up clinically 2 and 5 years later. Thirty-seven healthy controls (25 females, mean age 34. 4 years) were also scanned. In normal-appearing white matter, magnetization transfer <b>ratio</b> <b>gradients</b> were measured 1 - 5 mm and 6 - 10 mm from the lateral ventricles. In control subjects, magnetization transfer ratio was highest adjacent to the ventricles and decreased with distance from them; in optic neuritis, normal-appearing white matter magnetization transfer ratio was lowest adjacent to the ventricles, increased over the first 5 mm, and then paralleled control values. The magnetization transfer <b>ratio</b> <b>gradient</b> over 1 - 5 mm differed significantly between the optic neuritis and control groups [+ 0. 059 percentage units/mm (pu/mm) versus - 0. 033 pu/mm, P = 0. 010], and was significantly steeper in those developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis within 2 years compared to those who did not (0. 132 pu/mm versus 0. 016 pu/mm, P = 0. 020). In multivariate binary logistic regression the magnetization transfer <b>ratio</b> <b>gradient</b> was independently associated with the development of clinically definite multiple sclerosis within 2 years (magnetization transfer <b>ratio</b> <b>gradient</b> odds <b>ratio</b> 61. 708, P = 0. 023; presence of T 2 lesions odds ratio 8. 500, P = 0. 071).

Methods: AC/A ratios were measured {{in a group of}} Orthoptic students. The distance deviation (at 3. 8 m) was measured with an alternate prism cover test using a Gulden prism bar with and without - 3. 00 DS lenses. A Shin-Nippon SRW- 5000 auto-refractor [Grand Seiko Company, Fukuyama, Japan] (open view) was used to measure the refractive state with and without a - 3. 00 DS lens. The {{stimulus and response}} AC/A ratios were calculated. Results: Data were analysed for 16 participants. The mean and standard deviations (SD) of the distance stimulus <b>gradient</b> AC/A <b>ratio</b> were 1. 98 : 1 (1. 30) and the mean (SD) distance response <b>gradient</b> AC/A <b>ratio</b> were 2. 43 : 1 (1. 60).

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} tests {{have been conducted}} with Port Hills loess from the Ahuriri quarry. Tests have been conducted to obtain a theoretical basis for suggestions of good design practice for retaining wall filtration/drainage systems. The study has concentrated on investigation of geotextiles as filtration options, with granular filters being tested for comparison. Two of the tests (stage 1 test and <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> test) are designed to provide comparative information on filter performance with specific soil types. The third test {{is a series of}} three laboratory scale retaining wall simulations. Information from these tests provides evidence of potential problems with commonly used retaining wall filtration/drainage systems. In conjunction with laboratory testing, field observations have been carried out to assess {{the current state of the}} practice, and identify additional areas of concern. Results from both the <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> and stage 1 tests indicate good performance of a range of needle punched nonwoven geotextiles for filtering the specific soil tested (Ahuriri quarry loess). Scanning Electron Microscope investigation of the soil and geotextile filter structures formed during testing indicate bridging to be the dominant filter network, with one example of a vault network for the needle punched range. Small amounts of clogging observed within the geotextile structure have not resulted in significant reductions in permeability. <b>Gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> values for a selection of the needle punched range support evidence from the stage 1 test that satisfactory filter performance is provided. <b>Gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> values of greater than 3. 0 are recorded for two heat bonded nonwoven geotextiles, indicating a concerning level of clogging. Observations of tested heat bonded samples under the SEM show a degree of "blocking" (a specific form of clogging). These observations are supported by lower permeability values in both tests, comparative to the needle punched range, suggesting the needle punched range is better suited to filtering this specific soil type. Indications from the retaining wall simulations suggest a need for impermeable drain channels under drainage pipes to prevent erosion of loess resulting from water flow under the drain pipes. Also indicated by these tests is the presence of salts on the backfill material obtained from a local quarry. Although further investigation is recommended, the potential exists for corrosion of steel reinforcing where adequate water proofing is not placed. The need for adequate surface drainage (particularly during construction) in combination with good retaining wall design is emphasised. As a culmination of the testing and field work, a number of suggestions are put forward as aspects of good design practice for filtration/drainage systems for use in retaining walls on the Port Hills. Selection of an appropriate geotextile for a specific filtration project should ideally follow an in-depth design process, and should not be controlled by budget constraints, as is sometimes the case. Numerical design criteria, based on site specific soil properties and geotextile properties, as well as compatibility tests (such as the <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> test, or the stage 1 test) are available to aid in the design process...|$|E

Snow emissivity changes are revealed by episodic drops in the 37 - to 18 -GHz brightness temperature <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> measured by the Nimbus 7 scanning multichannel microwave radiometer. We suggest that the negative gradient ratios in spring 1982 result from increased scatter at 37 GHz due {{to the formation of}} a near-surface hoar layer. This interpretation is supported by the results of a surface radiation balance model that shows the melt signature occurring at below freezing temperatures but under clear-sky conditions with increased solar input to the surface. Published observations from the Greenland ice cap show a surface hoar layer forming under similar atmospheric conditions owing to the increased penetration and absorption of solar radiation just below the surface layer. In spring/early summer 1984 similar <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> signatures occur. They appear to be due to several days of freeze-thaw cycling following the movement of a low-pressure system through the region.

The basin relief varies from 0.085 to 0.58  km (Table  2). According to Schumm (1956), relief ratio is a ratio between basin relief and basin length. Relief ratio is an effective measure of gradient aspects of the basin (Schumm 1956; Vittala et al. 2004). Relief ratio in study area varies from 0.004 (KW) and 0.014 (SW- 6) (Table  2).

The GR 1836 is related to the emissivity at the atmospheric temperature sounding channels at around 50 GHz. Furthermore, the brightness temperatures and the polarisation ratio (PR) at the neighbouring 18, 36 and 50 GHz channels are highly correlated. Both the <b>gradient</b> <b>ratio</b> at 18 and 36 GHz and the PR at 36 GHz measured by SSMIS are input into the model predicting the 50 GHz emissivity for horizontal and vertical linear polarisations and incidence angles between 0 &#x 00 B 0; and 60 &#x 00 B 0; The simulated emissivity is compared to the emissivity derived with alternative methods. The fit to real AMSU observations is investigated using the different emissivity estimates for simulating the observations with atmospheric data from a regional weather prediction model...|$|E
40|$|A pulse {{detonation}} engine uses {{a series}} of high frequency intermittent detonation tubes to generate thrust. The process of filling the detonation tube with fuel and air for each cycle may yield non-uniform mixtures. Uniform mixing is commonly assumed when calculating detonation tube thrust performance. In this study, detonation cycles featuring idealized non-uniform H 2 /air mixtures were analyzed using a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics code with detailed chemistry. Mixture non-uniformities examined included axial equivalence <b>ratio</b> <b>gradients,</b> transverse equivalence <b>ratio</b> <b>gradients,</b> and partially fueled tubes. Three different average test section equivalence ratios were studied; one stoichiometric, one fuel lean, and one fuel rich. All mixtures were detonable throughout the detonation tube. Various mixtures representing the same average test section equivalence ratio were shown to have specific impulses within 1 % of each other, indicating that good fuel/air mixing is not a prerequisite for optimal detonation tube performance under the conditions investigated...|$|R
40|$|The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope {{as part of}} the Astro- 1 mission, {{was used}} to obtain {{high-resolution}} surface brightness distribution data in six ultraviolet wavelength bands for the bright reflection nebula NGC 7023. From the quantitative comparison of the measured surface brightness <b>gradients</b> <b>ratios</b> of nebular to stellar flux, and detail radial surface brightness profiles with corresponding data from the visible, two major conclusions results: (1) the scattering in the near- and far-ultraviolet in this nebula is more strongly forward-directed than in the visible; (2) the dust albedo in the ultraviolet for wavelengths not less than 140 nm is identical to that in the visible, {{with the exception of the}} 220 nm bump in the extinction curve. In the wavelengths region of the bump, the albedo is reduced by 25 to 30 percent in comparison with wavelengths regions both shorter and longer. This lower albedo is expected, if the bump is a pure absorption feature...|$|R
40|$|To date, the ketamine/PCP {{model of}} {{psychosis}} {{has been proposed}} {{to be one of}} the best pharmacological models to mimic schizophrenic psychosis in healthy volunteers, since ketamine can induce both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. At subanesthetic doses, ketamine has been reported to primarily block N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex giving support to a glutamate deficiency hypothesis in schizophrenia. Positron emission tomography was used to study ketamine-induced psychotic symptom formation in relation to cerebral metabolic alterations in healthy volunteers. Our study shows that NMDA receptor blockade results in a hyperfrontal metabolic pattern. Increased metabolic activity in the frontomedial and anterior cingulate cortex correlated positively with psychotic symptom formation, in particular with ego pathology. Analysis of correlations between syndrome scores and metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglu) or metabolic <b>gradients</b> (<b>ratios)</b> revealed that each psychopathological syndrome was associated with a number of metabolic alterations in cortical and subcortical brain regions, suggesting that not a single brain region, but distributed neuronal networks are involved in acute psychotic symptom formation.
