50|$|Besides {{the storage}} {{polysaccharide}} inulin (C6H12O6C6H10O5n), a polymer of fructose, the root contains <b>helenin</b> (C15H20O2), a stearoptene, {{which may be}} prepared in white acicular crystals, insoluble in water, but freely soluble in alcohol. When freed from the accompanying inula-camphor by repeated crystallization from alcohol, <b>helenin</b> melts at 110 °C.|$|E

50|$|In 1895 a German {{scientists}} Julius Bredt and Wilhelm Posh extracted <b>helenin</b> from Inula helenium {{and determined}} its {{physical and chemical}} properties.|$|E
50|$|The {{roots of}} Inula helenium can be {{extracted}} using alcohol or other non-polar solvents to produce <b>helenin</b> with a composition of about 40% alantolactone and 60% isoalantolactone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Helenin</b> is a {{phytochemical}} mixture {{found in}} many plant species, including the Inula helenium (elecampane) of the Asteraceae family. It {{is a mixture of}} two isomeric sesquiterpene lactones, alantolactone and isoalantolactone.|$|E
5000|$|During December 2012, {{the state}} {{suffered}} the severe Typhoon Bopha, {{and people were}} evacuated to Akebesang in Koror. There were 41 from Tobi, and 3 rangers from <b>Helen.In</b> 2013, the ranger station on Helen was fixed following damage caused by the Typhoon. The government decided to re-inhabit only Sonsorol Island, as it was cheaper and closer to get supplies to. The people of Tobi were given lands on Sonsorol, and now live there. In 2016, only Helen station is manned by 3 rangers.|$|E
50|$|Inulin was {{discovered}} in 1804 by German scientist Valentin Rose. He found “a peculiar substance” from Inula helenium roots by boiling water extraction. The substance was named inulin because of I. helenium, {{but it is also}} called <b>helenin,</b> alatin, and meniantin. Indigestible polysaccharides were of great scientific concern {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century. Irvine used chemical methods like methylation to study the molecular structure of inulin, and designed the isolation method for this new anhydrofructose. During studies of renal tubules in the 1930s, researchers searched for a substance that can serve as a biomarker that is not reabsorbed or secreted after introduction into tubules. Richards introduced inulin because of its high molecular weight and its resistance to enzymes. Today, inulin is used as an active ingredient for functional foods, and it is also used to determine the glomerular filtration rate.|$|E

Some of these species have a proven pharmacological action, while the medicinal value of other is still presumable. The presence of secretory canals {{in the structure of}} underground organs in some species is assumed to be related to <b>helenin,</b> a compound with multiple medicinal properties...|$|E
