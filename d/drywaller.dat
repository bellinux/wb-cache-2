25|$|Philip True {{was from}} San Fernando, California, and he {{attended}} both the Los Angeles Valley College and the University of California, Irvine, where {{he graduated in}} 1970. After college he was a dock worker and union representative, {{as well as a}} <b>drywaller.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Driscoll {{was born}} in Grand Forks, North Dakota and raised Roman Catholic in the Riverton Heights area of SeaTac, WA, which he {{described}} as [...] "a very rough neighborhood" [...] where serial killer Ted Bundy had picked up victims. He is the oldest of five children {{and the son of}} a union <b>drywaller.</b> He described a difficult family history of abuse and crime, writing: [...] "The men on my father's side include uneducated alcoholics, mental patients, and women beaters.... One of the main reasons my parents moved from North Dakota to Seattle was to get away from some family members when I was a very young boy." ...|$|E
50|$|Born in Tisdale, Saskatchewan Butt {{attended}} Tisdale Unit Composite School. After graduating, Butt briefly attended Ontario's Sheridan College. Butt {{returned to}} live at home. While working as a <b>drywaller</b> {{he and a friend}} started a publishing company - Windwolf Graphics. His comic, Existing Earth was nominated for a Golden Eagle Award. They published two issues before running out of money. In February 1988 Butt first performed at an amateur night at a Saskatoon comedy club. Butt is married to his Corner Gas and Hiccups co-star Nancy Robertson.|$|E
50|$|Jaime - Jaime has {{difficulty}} in hitting his studs, having moved them in previous challenges. Nevertheless, he finishes <b>drywalling</b> in 2:23.|$|R
50|$|Ruth - Ruth and her {{daughter}} quickly go to a war of words during the <b>drywalling,</b> but although they make up, their drywall remains incomplete.|$|R
50|$|In March 2007, BonaResponds sent {{approximately}} 60 {{volunteers to}} the Gulf Coast, specifically Pass Christian, MS and Bay St. Louis, MS. The plan {{for this trip}} quickly changed, as 48 of the volunteers were diverted to Enterprise, Alabama to assist after a recent tornado. After arriving in Mississippi, the 60 volunteers were spread across three different sites: Randy's Rangers and Bible Fellowship in Pass Christian, and the St. Rose Outreach and Recovery Center (SOAR) in Bay St. Louis. Most of Bonaresponds efforts during this trip involved rebuilding - projects this time included roofing, <b>drywalling,</b> and general contracting {{as well as some}} debris cleanup.|$|R

50|$|Ludwig {{was born}} during World War II and emigrated to Canada {{with his family}} from Friesland in the {{northern}} part of the Netherlands shortly after the war. He had seven older siblings. The family maintained strong religious beliefs and most kept ties with the Dutch Reformed Church or held some form of Baptist beliefs. In his early life, Ludwig worked as a carpenter and as a <b>drywaller.</b> He later studied pastoral ministry at Iowa's Dordt College which is associated with the Christian Reformed Church. While studying at Dordt, Wiebo met his future wife, Mamie, with whom he later had eleven children. Ludwig completed his pastoral education at the Calvin Theological Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan.|$|E
50|$|Johnston {{was born}} in Prince Edward Island, Canada. He had been {{employed}} as a <b>drywaller</b> when he met his wife, Tommi, and they eventually had four daughters. When Tommi developed leukemia, he began to grow and sell marijuana. In 1997, when Johnston was discovered, he received a total of eight years in prison (though he only served {{a year and a}} half before being paroled). However, within just weeks of incarceration, Johnston suffered a breakdown from which he never fully recovered. Tommi believes that the medicines that Johnston was given in prison had exacerbated, or possibly caused, his psychotic breakdown, which left him unable to support his family. In 2000, Johnston left his family, saying he wished to leave Canada for the United States, where he would seek help from a faith healer.|$|E
50|$|Group Challenge: Drywalls and Floors: After a {{professional}} crew installs a subfloor and drywalls one kitchen wall, the contestants, led by Tex, who {{was given a}} private lesson on <b>drywalling</b> and flooring by Geoff, are to install tongue-in-groove floors and drywall the other kitchen wall. Charmaine and Joe are to do the drywall, while Casey and Dez install the flooring. Tex is constantly having to stop Dez and Casey from installing the floors upside-down and backwards (i.e. tongue-on-tongue), while Charmaine and Joe install the drywall vertically instead of horizontally, leading to a structural weakness. Casey and Dez only manage some of the floor, while Charmaine and Joe do not manage to finish plastering.|$|R
50|$|<b>Drywalling</b> - The contestants must drywall their {{remaining}} exposed wall. All five handymen chose to install their drywall vertically, rather than horizontally. Angie and Eric pass despite not meeting Ontario building codes {{on the number}} of screws, while Brian M fails when he decides to have his drywall seams straddling his electrical outlets. Brian P only installs two pieces of drywall (one of them backwards) before giving up. Johnnie fails over the frustration caused when he accidentally covers an electrical outlet and is forced to take the large piece down; he then angrily tries to blame Darlis for his failure, causing her to storm out of the room in disgust. As the challenge finishes, Johnnie and Brian P both declare themselves the worst.|$|R
5000|$|Participants at each camp {{are divided}} into crews of six, {{including}} one to two adult leaders. Usually one or two crews are assigned to a work site. Work ranges from interior and exterior painting, to carpentry, <b>drywalling,</b> and basic masonry, depending {{on the needs of}} the particular site. As many as 80 work camps are organized each summer, each servicing multiple homes. An emphasis is placed on the spiritual life of the participants and of those homeowners served: [...] "Group Workcamps trips are designed to deepen your walk with Christ, while you serve people in Christ's name. It's not so much about the 'service projects' (although the challenge is important), it's more about God changing the hearts of your young people...and the people that are served.".|$|R
50|$|Where fire-resistance rated wall assemblies, be they masonry or drywall, {{meet the}} {{underside}} of the floor slab above, a movement joint results, which can be subject to compression, as the freshly placed concrete cures and shrinks all over a new building. This joint must be firestopped in a flexible manner. For concrete block walls that are not load-bearing, the contractor is often instructed to stop the wall about 25mm short of the slab above. The <b>drywaller</b> has to fasten a track to {{the underside of}} the slab above, which holds the metal studs. The drywall is then either stopped short allowing for a flexible buffer to be inserted or caulked in place, or one may use purpose-made tracks that hold the studs but permit up and down movement without damage to the system.|$|E
50|$|Candace - Candace's {{slow pace}} frustrates Justin, {{especially}} as how drywall pieces are cut confuses her (believing {{that she needs}} a special tool to cut drywall and not realizing that she is, in fact, holding and using a utility knife while making the statement) and the proper procedure often eludes her even as she is saying it (believing {{that there is no}} way to drywall around the window other than to measure and cut the drywall, which, although she is unaware of it, is correct). Justin takes matters into his own hands after seeing Candace take six minutes to cut a piece of drywall with a drywall saw, literally finishing the <b>drywalling</b> for Candace: while it took Candace 2:05 to cover a small section of a wall, it takes Justin 42 minutes to do the rest of the shed.|$|R
50|$|During {{the expert}} verdict, Brian M {{is taken to}} task for his <b>drywalling</b> mistake (applying plaster to a flat part of the wall), while Angie is criticized for the bad cut in her chair. Eric's {{criticism}} comes {{from the lack of}} screws in his drywall, and Johnnie is taken to task on all the challenges. While Angie is implicitly given consideration as the worst for the severe drop in quality of her work, the experts are ultimately so sure of who is the worst that, in a first for the show, they do not even bother to name two nominees. Johnnie had learned the most from the plumbing challenge, and is thus the most improved. However, Johnnie also did the most damage to his bathroom, so he is also the worst. As his homework task, Johnnie must master the six basic parts in soldering copper pipes together, all while singing to his infamous operatic musicalstyle.|$|R
50|$|Common Ground Collective {{eventually}} {{split off}} into multiple independent organizations - Common Ground Relief, Common Ground Tech Collective, New Orleans Women's Shelter, R.U.B.A.R.B. Bike Collective and the Common Ground Health Clinic. Thomas Pepper {{is the current}} operations director of Common Ground Relief. In September, 2007, Common Ground Relief shifted its focus from direct relief to rebuilding. In January 2008, Common Ground Relief bought property in the Lower Ninth Ward for its headquarters and long-term volunteer housing. Common Ground Relief's primary mission is the short term hosting of skilled volunteer groups (around 50 volunteers), who participate in projects which include wetlands restoration, bioremediation and community garden construction, a free legal clinic, an advocacy center, a job-training program for local residents, a lawn maintenance service, a media collective, <b>drywalling</b> and other rebuilding work. Common Ground Relief has established a tree farm to grow trees to be planted in storm-ravaged bayous east of New Orleans and to grow ornamental trees, ground covers, and shrubs to be planted in the Lower Ninth Ward.|$|R
50|$|Episode 2 - Days 4-6 (September 21) - The {{whole team}} (except Geoff) starts the episode by visiting a {{transfer}} station (Commissioners Street Transfer Station in Toronto's Port Lands) to raid the unwanted junk from visitors there, where they score an old dishwasher, a working microwave, and some stainless steel. A separate trip by Gordie and Cam {{leads them to}} a construction site, where they harvest their used lumber and weeping tile. However, a shortage of fasteners and drywall (being unable to find only scrap pieces and no full sheets) leads Geoff to spend $1000 on new drywall and screws (Cam agrees, as he believes that they would save on plaster compared to <b>drywalling</b> with their scrap pieces). Meanwhile, Michelle believes that she is being silenced in terms of design after Geoff has Gordie and Anthony design decorations made from freecycled materials behind her back (Gordie with a lamp and Anthony with a wine rack) while she and Ross go shopping, but her attitude changes for the better after the junk hotline leads Michelle, Gordie, and Jean-Marc to St. Luke's United Church, where they recover solid oak from old church pews, a large mirror, lockers, and an old desk that they intend to repurpose as their bathroom vanity. For the bathroom tiles, Anthony and Ross grab tiles from a warehouse where Anthony has previously freecycled for tile, but due to miscommunication with Michelle (who had insisted on going with them but was held back by Geoff), they return with more than twice what they need, forcing the team to give away the excess. In the end, Ron has some reservation as to the progress, and the accumulating pile of garbage at the worksite is leading him {{to believe that the}} site is being disrespected.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} {{evaluation}} by the experts, Jeff's shed {{is the first}} to be evaluated. Although the poor workmanship is clearly shown (Jeff claiming that he had finished the fewest number of challenges correctly - which is not actually true as Ruth finished fewer), he is vindicated as his learning experience was well worth the trip (to support this, his troubles with the jigsaw in the Skills Evaluation and his use of a circular saw to cut metal for his roof are contrasted, as is his lack of knowledge of a drywall file during the tool test and his usage of one during <b>drywalling).</b> Despite Jaime's claims, the experts actually consider Candace's shed to be the best, as it has a solid overall quality of workmanship and {{was the only one of}} the five to fully meet all the requirements. While there were questions over exactly how much of the work was really done by Justin, Candace did learn that doing things is not as simple as it appears on television, and she too is deemed not the worst by the experts (consideration was also given to her pregnancy, which made it impossible for her to safely carry out several of the challenges). Jaime's shed is also deemed not the worst, though the experts were still rather scornful that he had to resort to such lengths to get it out of the warehouse. The main critique they had for Jaime was lack of planning skills and his relationship with Sheilla, both of which were addressed over the course of the series (Sheilla, in fact, was entirely supportive of Jaime's plan in this episode). In fact, when informally polled by the contestants and nominators on who may be Canada's Worst Handyman, Jaime's name had never come up (Candace and Jeff having named themselves - Jeff from his self-admitted skill level, and Candace due to Justin having done most of the work - and Ruth and Terry having named each other). In a sense, these three had addressed the main issues that had led them to their nominations.|$|R
