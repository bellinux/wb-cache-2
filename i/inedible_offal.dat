The experimented animals {{were divided into two}} weight group basis on their pre-slaughter weight. The Group-I consisting of six goats with the pre slaughter weight ranging from 12 to 15 kg and Group-II having a pre slaughter weight of above 15 kg and up to 18 kg. The study revealed that dressing percentage, carcass length, Longimus dorsi area significantly (P < 0. 05) increased with increased in pre slaughter weight. The result of the study also revealed that the proportion of <b>inedible</b> <b>offal</b> viz., blood, head, skin, feet and alimentary tract decreased with increase in bodyweight. The slaughter weight did not have any influence on pH, water holding capacity and proximate composition values of its meat however the shear force value and tenderness value of the same significantly (P < 0. 01) increased as the pre slaughter weight increased...|$|E
40|$|The optimal mix {{of solid}} waste from the meat {{industry}} (MI) for anaerobic digestion (AD) treatment can be selected by defining the biomethane potential (BMP test) of the waste {{in relation to the}} unit value of chemical oxygen demand (COD). In this paper, the BMP test of biodegradable wastes from MI has been performed. For the purposes of the experiment, two types of input substrates have been defined: manure (manure from cattle depots and transport vehicles for cattle transport) labeled as O 1 and <b>inedible</b> <b>offal,</b> contents of the stomach, sludges from washing and cleaning, and the remains of meat defined as waste O 2. According to the BMP test, mixtures of fresh inoculum (38 g), waste O 1 and waste O 2 in quantities of 1 g and 2 g have been tested, and the model for the selection of the best mix in terms of the biogas yield has been defined. Based on correlations of CH 4 and COD, mixture M 1 (O 1 : O 2 = 80 : 20) is recommended, for treatment at the plant, because it has the highest yield of 256. 16 mL CH 4 per unit value of COD...|$|E
40|$|A Report {{from the}} Economic Research Service Animal {{byproducts}} {{contribute to the}} bottom line of the U. S. meat industry. Byproducts (edible offal (including variety meats), <b>inedible</b> <b>offal,</b> hides and skins, blood, fats, and tallow) include all parts of a live animal that {{are not part of the}} dressed carcass and constitute about 30 percent of the liveweight of hogs and about 44 percent of the live-weight of cattle. Byproducts from animal slaughter provide raw materials used in phar-maceutical, cosmetic, household, and industrial products. Exports of edible offal also contribute to the value and profitability of the U. S. meat processing industry in a way that leads to higher prices for livestock producers, as byproducts account for more than 23 and 35 percent of the volume of beef/veal and pork exports, respectively. Regression analysis indicates that a 10 -percent increase in the steer byproduct drop value adds a 1 -percent increase in the five-area weighted average price for all grades of steers. U. S. exports of beef/veal and pork edible offal have increased in recent years, mostly due to popula-tion growth, income growth, and consumer preferences for variety meats, especially in Asia. Income growth in the global marketplace, however, may have varied effects on the consumption and trade of variety meats...|$|E
40|$|Duck meat has {{combined}} {{properties of}} red and white meat and has high nutritional values. Kerala with its network of inland water sources is an ideal place for duck rearing. A study was undertaken to compare the yields of native dual purpose Kuttanad ducks (5 - 6 months) with the exotic broiler strain of Vigova ducks (6 - 8 weeks) based on slaughter and carcass weight. When compared to Kuttanad ducks, Vigova ducks exhibited significantly higher slaughter and carcass weights, carcass yields with skin, without skin and with giblets. Mean value of breast angle and yield of <b>inedible</b> <b>offals</b> were significantly higher (P < 0. 01) for Kuttanad ducks. Cut up parts except back and wing were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) for Vigova ducks. In both groups, breast showed the highest mean yield. Leg constituted the second highest cut up part in Vigova ducks, whereas it was back for Kuttanad ducks. The lowest mean yield was for thigh in both the ducks. On the basis of carcass weight, yields of meat and bones were significantly higher for Kuttanad ducks, however, the meat: bone ratios did not differ significantly. Vigova ducks were superior in carcass yield and {{could be used for}} meat production at a young age, making it suitable for commercial broiler production...|$|R
40|$|A {{total number}} of 48 male growing New Zealand rabbits were used to study the effect of two {{different}} levels of ration energy supplemented with mixture of Lupinus albus L, Trigonella foenum-graecum L and Cassia senna L as feed additives. Rabbits were classified into four equal groups (G 1 -G 4). The 1 st and 3 rd groups received basal ration with 100 % and 90 % energy requirement and served as first and second control respectively. The 2 nd and the 4 th groups received basal ration with 100 % and 90 % energy requirement supplemented with mixture {{at the level of}} 1. 5 %, respectively. The results showed that decreasing energy requirements level by 10 % in rabbit diets significantly (P 0. 05) CF and EE digestibility coefficients and TDN value. The 90 % energy requirement with 1. 5 % additives mixture (G 4) recorded the best digestibility coefficients of DM, OM, CP, CF, EE, NFE and nutritive values of TDN and DCP. The 90 % energy level significantly (P 4) recorded the best values of final body weight, body weight gain, and average daily gain as well as feed conversion. Additives mixture at 1. 5 % level significantly (P> 0. 05) increased the total <b>inedible</b> <b>offal's</b> (weight and % of SW) and Dm contents of the 9, 10 and 11 th ribs. The 90 % energy level with 1. 5 % additives mixture (G 4) diet recorded the highest value ofÂ  relative economic efficiency (145. 1 %) and the lowest value of feed cost/ kg live body weight (3. 97 LE). It can be concluded that this mixture of medicinal plants can be considered as growth promoter that is effective for improving the utilization of low energy diet by lowering circulating glucose levels through enhancing insulin sensitivity. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} involving the full- vs. limited-feeding of 9 pairs of gilts and 6 of barrows from a population of closely related Yorkshire pigs from approximately 45 kg. live weight up to each of three predetermined slaughter weight groups (79, 90 and 102 kg.). The objective {{was to determine the}} effects of level of feed intake, sex and weight on the chemical composition of the empty body, edible carcass and <b>inedible</b> parts (<b>offal)</b> and the fatty acid composition of the mid-back fat. As the slaughter weight increased, the percentages of empty body, carcass and offal protein and water decreased significantly, while the percentage of extractable fat increased significantly. These changes were most noticeable between the lightest (79 kg.) vs. the two heavy groups (90 and 102 kg.), but the two heavy groups had similar chemical composition. In absolute quantities, the protein, fat, water and ash increased as the slaughter weight increased. Since the chemical composition of the offal followed the same trends as observed for the carcass or the empty body and were fairly close in the three categories, it would appear that a reasonably high impression of the chemical composition of either the empty body or the carcass could be gained by analyzing the inedible parts (head, empty gastrointestinal tract and all other internal organs) and saving the edible carcass. There were no significant weight group differences in the fatty acid composition of the back fat, but the lightest pigs had slightly higher proportions of the unsaturated fatty acids and less of the saturated ones than the heavy groups. The restricted-fed pigs in all cases had higher percentages of protein, ash and water, and lower fat than the full-fed pigs; these differences being significant in most of the comparisons, except for the ash content that showed no significant differences in the carcass, offal or empty body. The absolute quantities of the protein, fat, ash and water for full- vs. limited-fed pigs followed the same trends as the percentages above. Feed restriction had the effect of increasing significantly the percentages of most of the unsaturated fatty acids and decreasing the percentages of the saturated fatty acids...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 2009 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 27, 28, and 29, 2009 Athens, Georgia. In 2007, Georgia poultry {{processors}} slaughtered over 1. 3 billion broilers (14. 4 % of U. S. production) in 21 {{processing plants}} across the state. Commercial broiler processing plants use {{an average of}} 6. 9 gallons of potable water per bird, with most plants falling in the 5 - 10 gallon range. Thus in 2007 alone, Georgia poultry processors used approximately 9 billion gallons of water. Much of this water is used for scalding, chilling, bird washing, and plant sanitation. The water is also the primary means by which <b>offal</b> (<b>inedible</b> solids) is transported out of the various processing areas for collection and separation from wastewater. Recent severe drought conditions in Georgia and {{the adoption of the}} Georgia Statewide Comprehensive Water Plan (with subsequent development of the Water Conservation Implementation Plan) have placed new emphasis on water conservation by traditional industrial users. To meet these new demands while maintaining or in many cases increasing production, Georgia poultry processors have turned to innovative water reuse systems that maximize water use efficiency while maintaining strict food safety requirements. Current systems utilized by poultry processors are presented with advantages and disadvantages of each explored. A case study is presented showing the decision making process employed by the plant management team in water reuse technology selection. Results and impact of the water reuse system are also presented. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division U. S. Geological Survey, Georgia Water Science Center U. S.
