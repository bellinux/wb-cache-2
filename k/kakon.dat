5|$|Five Bristol Fighters in bombing formation, {{took off}} at 11:40 with eight bombs each, which were dropped on {{retreating}} columns between Et Tire and Tulkarm. They also fired hundreds of machine gun bullets, scattering the retreating force towards <b>Kakon</b> and Tulkarm. At this time, machine gun {{fire from the}} ground aimed at the aircraft was fairly heavy, causing a number of casualties to the air crews. At 12:30, a second formation of three aircraft repeated {{the attack on the}} same retreating Ottoman column, which had reached the corner on the Tulkarm road. Six aircraft took off in the afternoon, two pursuing the retreating columns north of <b>Kakon</b> heading towards Baka, while four aircraft found soldiers, transport, artillery, horses, and camels moving from Tulkarm to Anebta. These they bombed and machine gunned, in a section of the road where it passed the little Wadi Zeimer, through a gorge with steep hills on either side. Before the column could escape, another formation of seven Bristol Fighters attacked them, at about 17:00 west of Anebta. The evening patrols reported the Ottoman Seventh Army headquarters still at Nablus, but the entire Eighth Army appeared to be in retreat, with their Tulkarm headquarters already captured. At the crossroads of the Afulah and the coast roads at Sumrah, a supply base with hospital and grain dump was in flames and its inhabitants were seen retreating into the hills.|$|E
5|$|At 01:15 the Handley-Page bomber piloted by the Australian Ross Smith {{took off}} {{carrying}} 16, 112-lb bombs to bomb Afulah railway junction and smash the central telephone exchange. At 05:20 Bristol Fighters flying over Afulah saw labourers working {{to repair the}} railway station, while at Bir el Hanuta, an Ottoman infantry battalion was seen moving southward to reinforce the front line. Flying west of the railway line, initial movements northward near Bir Ghaneim, already indicated {{the beginnings of a}} retreat. At 06:00 a bombing raid by D.H.9s attacked Afulah again. Later two Bristol Fighters reported 5,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, guns and 600 transport, retiring in disorder near Et Tire. On this massed Ottoman force, 20 small bombs were dropped and over 2,000 machine gun bullets were fired. At 10:00 the Nablus area appeared quiet, while shortly afterwards Jenin was bombed. At 11:30 the pilot reported having seen the leading cavalry division of Desert Mounted Corps, approaching Liktera on the Plain of Sharon. On the cavalry’s right rear at <b>Kakon,</b> Ottoman units were reported alarmed and beginning to move, while further south at Kalunsawe the roads were full of retreating army units.|$|E

There were several indications of increased defensive preparations on the coastal sector; improvements were made to the Afule to Haifa railway and there was increased road traffic all over this district while the trench system near <b>Kakon</b> was not being maintained. The smallest details of roads and tracks immediately opposite the British front and crossings of the important Nahr Iskanderuneh were all carefully observed.|$|E

While British squadrons were disrupted the Moabite harvest gangs, bombing raids from No. 1 Squadron were directed against the grain fields in the Mediterranean sector. On the same day of the El Kutrani raid; 16 June the squadron sent three raids, each of two machines, with incendiary bombs against the crops about <b>Kakon,</b> Anebta, and Mukhalid.

6000|$|Now, {{you know}} I told {{you in my}} fourth lecture, that the {{beginning}} of art was in getting our country clean and our people beautiful, and you supposed {{that to be a}} statement irrelevant to my subject; just as, at this moment, you perhaps think, I am quitting the great subject of this present lecture--the method of likeness-making--and letting myself branch into the discussion of what things we are to make likeness of. But you shall see hereafter that the method of imitating a beautiful thing must be different from the method of imitating an ugly one; and that, with the change in subject from what is dishonourable to what is honourable, there will be involved a parallel change in the management of tools, of lines, and of colours. So that before I can determine for you how you are to imitate, you must tell me what kind of face you wish to imitate. The best draughtsmen in the world could not draw this Apollo in ten scratches, though he can draw the self-made man. Still less this nobler Apollo of Ionian Greece, (Plate IX.) in which the incisions are softened into a harmony like that of Correggio's painting. So that you see the method itself,--the choice between black incision or fine sculpture, and perhaps, presently, the choice between colour or no colour, will depend on what you have to represent. Colour may be expedient for a glistening dolphin or a spotted fawn;--perhaps inexpedient for white Poseidon, and gleaming Dian. So that, before defining the laws of sculpture, I am compelled to ask you, what you mean to carve; and that, little as you think it, is asking you how you mean to live, and what the laws of your State are to be, for they determine those of your statue. You can only have this kind of face to study from, in the sort of state that produced it. And you will find that sort of state described {{in the beginning of the}} fourth book of the laws of Plato; as founded, for one thing, on the conviction that of all the evils that can happen to a state, quantity of money is the greatest!

40|$|Theophrastus had a {{systematic}} {{approach to the}} traditional problem of “catharsis” and treated the question referring to different fields of knowledge. He proved a keen and unprejudiced observer and collector of the largest possible number of experiences that may describe different kinds of catharsis. At a speculative level, he proceeded in continuity, but even going beyond his teacher’s opinions. Important building blocks {{in the construction of}} his cathartic theory were the development of the Aristotelian method through the criterion of the “more and the less”, which became the guiding principle he applied to physiological enquiries into humors and warmth. This led to a consequent focus on the physiological motions connected with the ones of the soul (both explained in terms of a dynamic relationship between different degrees of “tension” and “relaxation”, two key terms) and with the interpretation of ethical issues in relation to the different degrees of “tension” or “relaxation” of the motions of the soul linked to the emotions in so far as this dynamics produces both vices or virtues. The locution apolysis tôn <b>kakôn</b> (“release from evils”) seemingly substituted the term “catharsis” in the ethical contexts in which Theophrastus elaborated his original take on the theme. The cathartic effect of the physiological and psychological “release from evils” operated through a precise use of the human voice (valid both in music and in the performing arts) involves both the performer and the audience. From an ethical point of view, apolysis tôn <b>kakôn</b> (i. e catharsis) represents the unique end or purpose of his qualitative conception of music. In his view, religious piety does not consist in animal sacrifice or in traditional rites, but rather in an ethical “catharsis from evils” (katharsis tôn kakôn); therefore, this religious issue might be considered as the starting point and the conclusion of Theophrastus’s philosophical theory of catharsis, a theory in which the whole range of his science is involved...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of two parts. First, the prologue and first act of the play entitled Kalon <b>Kakon.</b> Second, a critical essay entitled 2 ̆ 7 Myths of the Kalan Kakon: Apocalyptic Femininity 2 ̆ 7. Both the creative and critical work attempt to expose the mythological/semiological {{process by which the}} signifying system of patriarchal monotheism misappropriated and suppressed the historic matriarchal symbolism and cosmologies of the Great Goddess. This creative-critical study shows that the genesis and supremacy of the myth of the exclusive, transcendent, anthropomorphic God and the patriarchal interpretative (symbolic) system, depended upon the subjugation of the Creatrix in the creation of entirely negative and illusionistic apocalyptic trajectories of the feminine, specifically the myth of the Kalan (beautiful) <b>Kakon</b> (evil or disaster). Kalon Kalron and the critical essay examine the patriarchal oppositional Signs or defense-objects (canonized myths-as-stories and patriarchal archetypes of masculinity and femininity) endemic to Judea-Christian, Graeco-Roman and other ancient and contemporary Iron-Age cultures, in the historic, socio-syrnbolic context of the Goddess. I have brought into play the Palaeolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age Goddess or Mother cultures and symbols of Sumeria, Akkadia, Assyria, Babylonia, Egypt and Canaan, all of which signify a precursory historical consciousness, an alternative symbolic/political economy of life and re-birth, modeled on the creative and inclusive lunar principle. Symbolic of the lunar cycle, the Creatrix expressed an archetypal unity and multiplicity which mediated an alternative, non-hierarchical model of relationship that did not disassociate creation from the creative source. A comparative study {{of the way in which}} the Creatrix and the patriarchal God function as symbols of divinity in the constitution and naturalisation of specific mytho-political economies, is crucial to this work. Ar. a divine signifier, the uroboric (non-dualistic), bodily unabstracted identity of the Primal Goddess provided a mythological model of immanently divine Creation (Paradise). This creative-critical work reveals that the solar hero or god-king of Babylonian Creation mythology and its mythological heir, the exclusive, patriarchal God of monotheistic traditions, achieved presence by rupturing the archetypal unity between Creator and Creation, symbolized through the body of the Great Mother. Kalon <b>Kakon</b> and the critical work attempt to deconstruct and repoliticise this mythical division or space of fear and desire in which patriarchal myths of the feminine- Signs of the binary, of Empire and of the m(other) - became imaginable and/or materialized. The re-mythologisation of the Goddess (female creativity/sexuality) as Primal Sin, the Origin (scapegoat) and vessel/Sign of chaos and death, served to desacralise the signifying body (the creative and symbolic power) of the Goddess and legitimize the authority of the male Creator over the goddess/creation. The critical work examines the way in which patriarchal myths of the feminine (Kalan Kakons) function as Signs of absolute Law or prohibition, obscuring the historic-symbolic significance of the Creatrix and of all creative (m) others as divine signifiers. The patriarchal myth-as-story in which the Goddess is rendered the sinner (Eve) and the sinner is rendered sexless (non-creative) and therefore reformed and sanctified (the Second-Eve), exemplifies the patriarchal mythological (double-censorship) process which has allowed for the patriarchal monopolization of symbols (the signifying world) in monotheistic civilization. The play and essay critically reveal how the violation and dissolution of the original feminine archetype into two categories of patriarchal derivation, the sexual object to be denied and the (reformed) sexless, barren mother, constituted the patriarchal Creator (mythologically) as the exclusive maker and master of (Mother) creation. This creative-critical work challenges the exclusivity and origins of this mythological process and the Signs of creative prohibition - of the Fall of the Great Mother - which have become the mythological-symbolic (doctrinal) inheritance of hierarchical Father-cultures...|$|E
