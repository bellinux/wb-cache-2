40|$|With {{advent of}} complex and {{expensive}} automated manufacturing systems tool management {{is becoming an}} important issue both in design and implementation phases. The use of highly automated technology has resulted in an increasing need to integrate tool management more thoroughly into other planning and operational issues of these systems. In this research effort a discrete events simulation model has been developed to analyze the system performance under different operational strategies. These strategies include three tool configurations; identical, nonidentical and hybrid, and two part loading patterns; batch and random loading. In addition, a new tool refilling concept, tool replenishing, is also examined. The replenishing concept consists of two policies; preventive and failure replenishing. The effects of shared and dedicated tooling policies have also been investigated. With the comparison of performance measures for each set of operational strategies, the mutual advantages and concerns of each of them are highlighted. Within the simulation scope, the shared tooling policy is significantly superior to the dedicated tooling policy. It is also shown that <b>identical</b> <b>tool</b> configuration outperforms the other tool configurations. These have been confirmed by statistical tests performed on the simulation results...|$|E
40|$|Selective laser melting(SLM) {{and direct}} metal laser sintering(DMLS) are {{preferred}} additive manufacturing processes in producing complex physical products directly from CAD computer data, nowadays. The advancement of additive manufacturing promotes {{the design of}} internally cooled cutting tool for effectively used in removing generated heat in metal machining. Despite the utilisation of SLM and DMLS in a fabrication of internally cooled cutting tool, the level of accuracy of the parts produced remains uncertain. This paper aims at comparing the dimensional accuracy of SLM and DMLS in machining internally cooled cutting tool with a special focus on geometrical dimensions such as hole diameter. The surface roughness produced by the two processes are measured with contact perthometer. To achieve the objectives, geometrical dimensions of <b>identical</b> <b>tool</b> holders for internally cooled cutting tools fabricated by SLM and DMLS have been determined by using digital vernier calliper and various magnification of a portable microscope. In the current study, comparing internally cooled cutting tools made of SLM and DMLS showed that generally the higher degree of accuracy could be obtained with DMLS process. However, the observed differences in surface roughness between SLM and DMLS {{in this study were}} not significant. The most obvious finding to emerge from this study is that the additive manufacturing processes selected for fabricating the tool holders for internally cooled cutting tool in this research are capable of producing the desired internal channel shape of internally cooled cutting tool...|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{research}} in tool management has ignored {{the potential impact of}} tool life on shop performance. Tool management research has typically assumed that tool life is deterministic and can be predicted accurately. Since tool life is a function of its quality, cutting speed, depth and other environmental factors, no two <b>identical</b> <b>tools</b> exhibit the exact same tool life. An assumption of stochastic tool life is more realistic on the actual shop floor. In this paper, we have developed a simulation model {{to examine the effects of}} stochastic tool life, dispatching rules and tool failure penalties on shop performance...|$|R

The surrounding parameter of cold-water coral reef growth is characterised by hydrophysical signals such as temperature and salinity, both yielded in potential density {{as a function of}} temperature, salinity and pressure. Within the past years a serious increase in knowledge on these cold-water coral occurrences and their hydrographic boundary conditions yielded worldwide, especially in the north-east Atlantic. This study investigates in the assessment of the environmental conditions of cold-water coral (CWC) growth in response to geochemical, hydrographic and oceanographic boundary processes. This study aims to unravel the environmental signals that influence CWC growth in different latitudes, which are of great importance for growth and occurrences. For this purpose, cold-water coral reefs in the north Atlantic margin, in the Gulf of Mexico, off Bahamas, in the Bay of Biscay, and off Morocco as well as Mauretania were selected. The comparison of data sets collected with <b>identical</b> <b>tools</b> yielded detailed information on the environmental conditions needed for healthy cold-water-reef growth...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} {{identical}} NC machines, {{laid out in}} a line, manufactures relatively few part types in large batch size. Parts of the same type are processed by the machines simultaneously. The operations on a part are performed by one machine only, using a part type specific tool set. During batch production the tool magazines of the machines contain the same set of tools. If the machine group is provided with an automatic tool transport system then tools can be shared. Therefore, the number of <b>identical</b> <b>tools</b> can be reduced and savings with respect to investment in tools are possible. A disadvantage of tool sharing is that machines might become idle because tools have not arrived in time. Suitable dispatching and scheduling of the tool transportation device can reduce these machine waiting times. In this paper the characteristics of the production situation are examined. The consequences of three tool transport policies with respect to transport time and transport frequency of the transportation device are analyzed. Analytical results are presented and some extensions are discussed. The method presented provides a way to analyze transport rules in this type of systems...|$|R
40|$|Domain Specific Languages {{are raising}} {{the level of}} abstrac-tion of {{software}} specifications and of knowledge representa-tion in general. When DSLs are used to formalize the results of domain analysis, {{the result is a}} clean separation of con-cerns in the problem space. This is a major advance over aspect oriented programming, where separation of concerns is only achieved in the solution space. However, the level of interoperability between current DSL tools is comparable to the level of interoperability between CASE tools in the 90 s. To increase the popularity of DSL based approaches, this needs to change. Software development has become highly decentralized, and an assumption that all parties in a global software supply chain will use <b>identical</b> <b>tooling</b> is simply not realistic. As a result today's software supply chains are much less automated than supply chains in other, more mature in-dustries.

40|$|Thermally {{assisted}} machining is {{an emerging}} manufacturing process {{for improving the}} productivity when machining many difficult-to-cut engineering materials. Traditionally the process is reserved for very hard and high strength materials where abrasive and notching wear mechanisms cripple tool longevity. Recently there has been interest in using the process to machine titanium alloys and published reports indicate that machinability is improved, namely though a reduction in cutting forces. However, there is still ambiguity about whether the process is beneficial for tool life and the specific wear mechanisms for carbide tooling remain unknown. This work characterises the tool life and wear mechanism for two uncoated carbide tools when turning Ti- 6 Al- 4 V at high speed. While {{it is observed that}} thermally assisted machining reduces the cutting forces, it is found that the process has a deleterious effect on tool life because the dominant wear mechanism associated with diffusion is exacerbated during thermally enhanced machining. The process is compared against coolant technologies from the literature using <b>identical</b> <b>tooling</b> and cutting parameters and it is found that cooling the tool suppresses adhesion-diffusion wear and significantly prolongs tool life...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the safety and effectiveness of pacemaker lead extraction with the excimer sheath in comparison to nonlaser lead extraction. BACKGROUNDFibrotic attachments that develop between chronically implanted pacemaker leads and to the venous, valvular and cardiac structures are the major obstacles to safe and consistent lead extraction. Locking stylets and telescoping sheaths produce a technically demanding but effective technique of mechanically disrupting the fibrosis. However, ultraviolet excimer laser light dissolves instead of tearing the tissue attachments. METHODSA randomized trial of lead extraction was conducted in 301 patients with 465 chronically implanted pacemaker leads. The laser group patients had the leads removed with <b>identical</b> <b>tools</b> as the nonlaser group with the exception that the inner telescoping sheath was replaced with the 12 -F excimer laser sheath. Success for both groups was defined as complete lead removal with the randomized therapy without complications. RESULTSComplete lead removal rate was 94 % in the laser group and 64 % in the nonlaser group (p = 0. 001). Failed nonlaser extraction was completed with the laser tools 88 % of the time. The mean time to achieve a successful lead extraction was significantly reduced for patients randomized to the laser tools, 10. 1 ± 11. 5 min compared with 12. 9 ± 19. 2 min for patients randomized to nonlaser techniques (p < 0. 04). Potentially life-threatening complications occurred in none of the nonlaser and three of the laser patients, including one death (p = NS). CONCLUSIONSLaser-assisted pacemaker lead extraction has significant clinical advantages over extraction without laser tools and is associated with significant risks...|$|R

40|$|This Diploma Thesis {{deals with}} {{obstructions}} within {{the legislative process}} of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, more precisely in hearings at the Lower House. The aim of the thesis is to describe the phenomenon of obstructions and their importance in the legislative process. In the beginning, the author establishes three basic research questions, which he then tries to answer through quantitative methods. Firstly, the author answers the question whether either site of the ideological spectrum tends to use the tactic of obstruction more often. Secondly, he inquires whether there are any differences between the obstructions of a right-wing or a left-wing party. Finally, the author aims to clarify if the long-established parties in the Chamber of Deputies have an advantage {{in the practice of}} obstructions and thus are more successful in it than new parties are. The text is divided into three separate chapters with a logical structure starting from theoretical themes and continuing with an empirical analysis. The first part, which is purely theoretical, is followed by a chapter dealing with the legislative process which can be considered as a transition between the theoretical and empirical parts. The following chapter is based on empiricism and analyses stenographic records and interviews with the representatives of political parties. The carried out analyses suggest {{that it is impossible to}} state clearly which site of the ideological spectrum tends to use the tactic of obstruction more often, as in the majority of cases parties using this tactic find themselves in the opposition. However, while obstructing, both left-wing and right-wing parties use almost <b>identical</b> <b>tools.</b> Ultimately, it can be stated that parties represented in the House of Deputies for a long period are not more successful in practicing obstructions than other parties, even though they use strategies that are more sophisticated...|$|R

40|$|This work {{outlines}} the novel {{application of the}} empirical analysis of causation, presented by Kutach, {{to the study of}} information theory and its role in physics. The central thesis of this paper is that causation and information are <b>identical</b> functional <b>tools</b> for distinguishing controllable correlations, and that this leads to a consistent view, not only of information theory, but also of statistical physics and quantum information. This approach comes without the metaphysical baggage of declaring information a fundamental ingredient in physical reality and exorcises many of the otherwise puzzling problems that arise from this view-point, particularly obviating the problem of non-local causal influences in quantum entanglement. Additionally, this duality of causation and information allows for a reconciliation of related problems in physics, like that of the `excess baggage' in quantum mechanics. Finally, it is demonstrated that black hole holography can be understood as a property of the causal structure of black hole spacetimes and is thus not necessarily a fundamental result in any sense of the word. This forms the basis of a suggestion whereby black holes destroy information but do not result in a unitarity violation. Comment: 28 pages, prepared for submission to BJP...|$|R

This trend is expected to continue, and many of the children born after the year 2000 can expect to live to celebrate their hundredth birthday. In the last 20 years alone, average life expectancy has increased globally by 6 years. During the same period, doctors have announced a global epidemic of the most common killers: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One of the most important reasons for the more frequent recognition of these diseases is the fact that their diagnostic criteria have changed and become much more acute during the past few years. These changes in diagnostic criteria have made it difficult, or even impossible, to compare the present statistical data regarding these diseases to historical data for the same illnesses.

MethodKnee OA was induced in Sprague Dawley rats by either meniscal transection (MNX) or intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA). Controls were subjected to sham surgery or saline-injection. In a separate experiment, a single intra-articular injection of triamcinolone acetonide was administered 14 days after MNX or MIA arthritis induction. Pain behavior and joint pathology were quantified. ResultsBoth models displayed synovial inflammation, chondropathy and osteophytosis. Chondropathy scores increased with time similarly in the two models. Inflammation and osteophyte scores were greater in MNX model compared to the MIA model. At day 49, the MNX model exhibited {{a greater number of}} channels crossing the osteochondral junction compared to all other groups. The MNX model exhibited greater weight bearing asymmetry compared to the MIA model, whereas the MIA model displayed more consistent hindpaw allodynia. Triamcinolone attenuated weight bearing asymmetry and distal allodynia to control levels in the MNX model, but distal allodynia was unaltered in the MIA model. ConclusionsThe comparison of the two models of OA in rats, using <b>identical</b> assessment <b>tools</b> has demonstrated that although both models display features of OA, there are differences between the models which may represent different aspects of human OA.

40|$|Asian small-clawed otters (Aonyx cinerea) {{demonstrate}} remarkable hand dexterity when {{gathering and}} consuming prey, but {{little is known}} about their ability to use objects as tools. The present study used a tool choice paradigm in which six Asian small-clawed otters were tested individually and presented with two <b>identical</b> hook-shaped <b>tools.</b> For each trial, only one tool was positioned such that pulling it allowed an otter to obtain food. Pulling the other hook resulted in the correct hook being moved out of reach, necessitating selection of the correct tool as its first choice The two males performed above chance levels, but the four females did not. The females’ poor overall performance may have reflected their initial inability to understand the tool choice task. Two of the females’ performances improved by 20 % {{over the course of the}} trials, and another female showed 5 % improvement over time. In addition, some incorrect responses appeared to be due to the development of a side preference, rather than to the configuration of the apparatus. Four of the otters exhibited a significant side bias toward the left, but there were individual differences in how these preferences presented in each otter. For all otters, latency to approach and make a choice on the tool-use task decreased over time, regardless of success. Although otters do appear capable of learning which tool should be used in a forced choice comparison such as the one used here, other factors appear to influence the choices individual otters make...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} the {{comparability}} of knowledge transfer activities is discussed by accounting for external impacts. It is shown that factors which are neither {{part of the}} knowledge transfer activity nor part of the participating institution may have {{significant impact on the}} potential usefulness of knowledge transfer activities. Differences in the potential usefulness are leading to different initial conditions of the knowledge transfer activities. This needs {{to be taken into account}} when comparing different knowledge transfer activities, e. g., in program evaluations. This study is focusing on regional climate services at the German Baltic Sea coast. It is based on two surveys and experiences with two <b>identical</b> web <b>tools</b> applied on two regions with different spatial coverage. The results show that comparability among science based knowledge transfer activities is strongly limited through several external impacts. The potential usefulness and thus the initial condition of a particular knowledge transfer activity strongly depends on (1)  the perceived priority of the focused topic, (2)  the used information channels, (3)  the conformity between the research agenda of service providing institutions and information demands in the public, as well as (4)  on the spatial coverage of a service. It is suggested to account for the described external impacts for evaluations of knowledge transfer activities. The results show that the comparability of knowledge transfer activities is limited and challenge the adequacy of quantitative measures in this context. Moreover, as shown in this case study, in particular regional climate services should be individually evaluated on a long term perspective, by potential user groups and/or by its real users. It is further suggested that evaluation criteria should be co-developed with these stakeholder groups...|$|R
40|$|Most widely {{accepted}} classification of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems includes operational, analytical, collaborative and e-CRM. While operational, collaborative, and e-CRM {{has received a}} significant interest among practitioners and scholars, but analytical CRM has been mostly neglected by them. The major function of analytical CRM is to support strategic customer information provision and customer knowledge acquisition to help achieve the final goal of CRM which is to enhance customer profitability. Customer profitability {{is the difference between}} revenue and costs. The main objective of the thesis is to investigate the role of analytical CRM in maximizing customer profitability. In order to accomplish the objective of this thesis, a qualitative research approach was se-lected and a multiple-case study was conducted which consisted of two cases. The cases com-prised two leading banks with large market share in private banking in Sweden. The primary data were collected via in-depth interviews with banks’ managers employing the interview guide. The analytical CRM system had been implemented and actively utilized by both banks. The main finding shows that <b>identical</b> analytical <b>tools,</b> segmentation and profiling approaches were used by both banks: albeit minor discrepancies were observed due to the decentralized branch banking approaches taken by one of the banks. The Internet was found to assist collec-tion of more precise data, to increase the analytical ability and to create faster degrees of per-formance. The results also indicate that customer profitability was highly considered by both banks and tactical measures were exercised to augment the customer profitability, particularly among the core customers, with providing them extra and personalized services at no charge and acknowledging the staffs of the vital importance of this segment of customers to the profit of the banks.
