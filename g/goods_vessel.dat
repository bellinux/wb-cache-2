50|$|The River Irwell {{was made}} navigable in 1720s, {{leading to the}} {{construction}} of a quay in the area for loading and unloading of <b>goods</b> (<b>vessels</b> of up to 50 tons could dock here and ply between Manchester and Liverpool).|$|R
60|$|Richard Rosco sits in {{the cabin}} of the vessel, for it is he who {{commands}} her. He had taken her as a prize, and, finding her a <b>good</b> <b>vessel</b> in all respects, had adopted her in preference to the old piratical-looking schooner. A seaman stands before him.|$|R

60|$|He was right. When {{the losses}} {{of that night}} came to be {{reckoned}} up, several <b>good</b> <b>vessels</b> were discovered to be missing, but the rotten old Rainbow still remained undestroyed though not unscathed, and a sad sight met {{the eyes of the}} men of the fleet when daylight revealed {{the fact that some of}} the smacks had their flags flying half-mast, indicating that many men had been washed overboard and lost during the night.|$|R
60|$|Each {{of these}} good captains lived alone, and each took entire charge {{of his own}} {{domestic}} affairs, {{not because he was}} poor, but because it pleased him to do so. When Captain Eli retired from the sea he was the owner of a <b>good</b> <b>vessel,</b> which he sold at a fair profit; and Captain Cephas had made money in many a voyage before he built his house in Sponkannis and settled there.|$|R
60|$|When {{the weather}} at last changed {{and the sea}} became smoother, {{it was found that}} the working and {{straining}} of the masts during the violent weather had opened some of the seams of the brig, and that she was taking in water. She was a <b>good</b> <b>vessel,</b> but she was an old one, and she had had a rough time of it. The captain thanked his stars that she had not begun to leak before the storm.|$|R
60|$|As a {{consequence}} of these peculiarities, the passengers of the Winkelried had early evidence that they had trifled too long with the fickle air. The breeze carried them up abreast of Lausanne in good season, but here {{the influence of the}} mountains began to impair its force, and, by the time the sun had a little fallen towards the long, dark, even line of the Jura, the <b>good</b> <b>vessel</b> was driven to the usual expedients of jibing and hauling-in of sheets.|$|R

That's a {{light-ship}} on the dangerous shoal called the Shambles, where many a <b>good</b> <b>vessel</b> has gone to pieces. Between it and ourselves is the Race--a place where antagonistic currents meet and form whirlpools--a spot which is rough in the smoothest weather, and terrific in a wind. That dark, dreary horizon we just discern to the left is the West Bay, terminated landwards by the Chesil Beach.' ...|$|R
60|$|As soon as Pierre's boat {{touched the}} Spanish vessel, the buccaneers sprang {{on board with}} their pistols and cutlasses, and a savage fight began. The Spaniards were surprised, {{but there were a}} great many more of them than there were pirates, and they fought hard. However, the man who makes the attack, and who {{is at the same time}} desperate and hungry, has a great advantage, and it was not long before the buccaneers were masters of the vessel. Those of the Spaniards who were not killed, were forced into the service of their captors, and Pierre found himself in command of a very <b>good</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{had been}} a storm, and a <b>good</b> many <b>vessels</b> had run into the inlet for shelter. Blackbeard knew {{nearly all of the}} captains of these vessels, and it was from them that he first heard of the proclamation.|$|R
50|$|The Empire was {{required}} to grant freedom of transit to persons, <b>goods,</b> <b>vessels,</b> etc., passing through her territory, and goods in transit were {{to be free of}} all customs duties. Future developments of the tax system, the customs system, internal or external loans, import and export duties, or concessions could not be arranged without the consent of the financial commission of the Allied powers. To forestall the economic re-penetration of Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Bulgaria the treaty demanded that the Empire liquidate the property of citizens of those countries in its territories. This public liquidation was to {{be turned over to the}} Reparations Commission. Property rights of the Baghdad Railway passed out of German control.|$|R

"Of what {{matter is}} it," [...] {{continued}} the calculating waterman, who was rather conspicuously {{known for the}} love of thrift that is usually attributed to most of the inhabitants of that region, [...] "whether there be one headsman or twenty in the bark, so long as the <b>good</b> <b>vessel</b> can float and steer? Our Leman winds are fickle friends, and the wise take them while in the humor. Give me the breeze at west, and I will load the Winkelried to the water's edge with executioners, or any other pernicious creatures thou wilt, and thou mayest take the lightest bark that ever swam in the bise, and let us see who will first make the haven of Vévey!" ...|$|R

[...] If to this notice be added the year 1826, you have the very hour and place of our embarkation. We were nominally of the London party, it being our intention, however, to land at Cowes, from which place we proposed crossing the Channel to Havre. The reason for making this variation from the direct route, was the superior comfort of the London ship; that of the French line for the 1st June, though a <b>good</b> <b>vessel</b> and well commanded, being actually the least commodious packet that plied between the two hemispheres.|$|R
60|$|Going on deck {{early on}} the morning of the 30th, a glorious view {{presented}} itself. The day was fine, clear, and exhilarating, and the wind was blowing fresh from the westward Ninety-seven sail, which had come into the Channel, like ourselves, during the thick weather, were in plain sight. The majority were English, but we recognized the build of half the maritime nations of Christendom in the brilliant fleet. Everybody was busy, and the blue waters were glittering with canvass. A frigate was in the midst of us, walking through the crowd like a giant stepping among pigmies. Our own <b>good</b> <b>vessel</b> left everything behind her also, with the exception of two or three other bright-sided ships, which happened to be as fast as herself.|$|R
50|$|This schooner, {{which was}} of Italian origin and built in August 1899, was {{commanded}} by captain Narciso Antonio Barsello.

40|$|As {{the use of}} robotic-assisted surgery systems {{continue}} to increase, highly accurate and timely efficient automatic vasculature detection techniques for large and thin vessels in the retinal images are needed. Vascular segmentation has however been challenging due to uneven illumination in retinal images. The use of efficient pre-processing techniques as well as good segmentation techniques are highly needed to produce <b>good</b> <b>vessel</b> segmentation results. This paper presents an investigatory study on the combination of phase congruence with fuzzy c-means and the combination of phase congruence with gray level co-occurrence (GLCM) matrix sum entropy for the segmentation of retinal vessels. Fuzzy C-Means combined with phase congruence yields a higher accuracy rate but a longer running time while compared to GLCM sum entropy combined with phase congruence. While compared with the widely previously used techniques on DRIVE and STARE databases, the techniques investigated yield high average accuracy rates...|$|R
40|$|Fasting blood lipids were {{analyzed}} shortly before revascularization surgery {{in an attempt}} to find a possible correlation between the fate of the aortocoronary saphenous vein graft and lipoproteinemia. The patency of the bypass was evaluated by arteriography at two weeks and at one year following operation. Patients with closed grafts at two weeks had an original mean serum triglyceride concentration of 287 mg. / 100 ml. Patients with grafts which were widely patent after one year had an original triglyceridemia of 224 mg. / 100 ml. The severely stenosed group had an intermediate average preoperative value of 224 mg. / 100 ml. The same conclusion was reached with a group of patients with <b>good</b> <b>vessel(s)</b> distal to the graft(s). Cholesterolemia was about the same in all groups. These results suggest the hypothesis that hypertriglyceridemia plays {{a significant role in the}} reduction and/or occlusion of the lumen of the vein graft...|$|R
