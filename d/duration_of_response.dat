50|$|These interneurons are {{specialized}} {{for time}} sensitivity in several ways. First, when activated, they generally respond {{with only one}} or two action potentials. This short <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> allows their action potentials to give a very specific indication of the exact moment of the time when the stimulus arrived, and to respond accurately to stimuli that occur close in time to one another. In addition, the neurons have a very low threshold of activation - they respond quickly even to weak stimuli. Finally, for FM signals, each interneuron is tuned to a specific frequency within the sweep, as well as to that same frequency in the following echo. There is specialization for the CF component of the call at this level as well. The high proportion of neurons responding to the frequency of the acoustic fovea actually increases at this level.|$|E
50|$|The {{results of}} a Phase III trial were {{published}} in October 2011 in Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. Vol 68, pages 945-950 (Open access at http://www.springerlink.com/content/c2624362664404t5/). This study used Lipoplatin in combination with paclitaxel as first line treatment against ns-NSCLC and compared response rates and toxicities to a similar group of patients treated with cisplatin plus paclitaxel. This study has demonstrated an increase in tumor response rate in the Lipoplatin arm (59.22% of patients) versus the cisplatin arm (42.42%, of patients) which was statistically significant (p value = 0.036). Most major toxicities of cisplatin, especially nephrotoxicity were also reduced {{in the group of}} patients treated with Lipoplatin. Median survival times were 10 months for the Lipoplatin arm and 8 months for the cisplatin arm, with a p-value of 0.155. The median <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> was 7 months for the Lipoplatin arm and 6 months for the cisplatin arm. Although not statistically significant, these results suggest the potential for superior overall survival (OS) for Lipoplatin compared to cisplatin, a hypothesis that is being tested in a larger trial. Furthermore, among the responders to Lipoplatin a subgroup of patients demonstrated a substantially higher overall survival than a comparable subgroup of cisplatin responders. After 10 months, 30% of patients in the Lipoplatin arm, as compared with just 16% of patients in the cisplatin arm, were without disease progression. By the end of the trial, there were 32 patients alive, 21 from the Lipoplatin arm (20.39%) and 11 from the cisplatin arm (11.11%). Thus, after 18 months, the number of surviving patients was approximately double for Lipoplatin versus cisplatin. The clinical development of Lipoplatin in adenocarcinomas establishes this drug as the most active platinum drug with significantly lower side effects.|$|E

Radioembolization with yttrium- 90 microspheres as selective internal radiation therapy demonstrated favorable outcomes for this intractable disease. We reported {{our series of}} patients with extremely advanced unresectable HCC treated with yttrium- 90 micospheres. Methods: Patients with extremely advanced inoperable and evaluable HCC including those with single lesion > 8 cm in maximal diameter or multiple bi-lobar lesions (total > 5 lesions) or portal vein invasion were evaluated by hepatic angiography and macroalbumin aggregate (MAA) scan for feasiblity for radioembolization. Dose of yttrium- 90 was determined by Body Surface Area (BSA) method with an aim to achieve dose to tumour > 200 Gy, dose to normal liver 6 months (11. 8 vs. 3. 1 months, p = 0. 020) and whose tumour had absence of portal vein invasion (4. 5 vs. 3. 1 months, p = 0. 057). Longer median OS were also revealed in those without portal vein invasion (17. 1 vs. 4. 4 months, p = 0. 020) and those whose <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> AFP <b>response</b> > 6 months (19. 8 vs. 8. 2 months, p = 0. 008). Four patients (14. 3 %) developed grade 3 or above toxicity including 1 patient who had persistent radiation peptic ulcer requiring gastrectomy. Univariate analysis showed that prior TACE (p = 0. 043) and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> AFP <b>response</b> > 6 months were prognostic of PFS, whereas absence of portal vein invasion (p = 0. 027) and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> AFP <b>response</b> > 6 months (p = 0. 017) were prognostic factors of OS.
