40|$|Even {{though we}} can {{recognize}} faces by touch surprisingly well, haptic face recognition performance is still worse than for visual exploration. One possibility for this performance difference {{might be due}} to different <b>encoding</b> strategies <b>in</b> the two modalities, namely, holistic <b>encoding</b> <b>in</b> vision versus serial <b>encoding</b> <b>in</b> haptics. Here, we tested this hypothesis by promoting serial <b>encoding</b> <b>in</b> vision, using a novel, gaze-restricted display that limited the effective field of view in vision to resemble that of haptic exploration. First, we compared haptic with gaze-restricted and unrestricted visual face recognition. Second, we used the face inversion paradigm to assess how encoding differences might affect processing strategies (featural vs. holistic). By promoting serial <b>encoding</b> <b>in</b> vision, we found equal face recognition performance in vision and haptics with a clear switch from holistic to featural processing, suggesting that performance differences in visual and haptic face recognition are due to modality-specific encoding strategies...|$|R

Other physicists attempted to construct object-based models which did away with this superluminal communication, but Bell's theorem later proved this to be impossible.

5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} using information <b>encoded</b> <b>in</b> genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes <b>encoded</b> <b>in</b> DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{the chief}} actors within the cell, {{said to be}} {{carrying}} out the duties specified by the information <b>encoded</b> <b>in</b> genes. With the exception of certain types of RNA, most other biological molecules are relatively inert elements upon which proteins act. Proteins make up half the dry weight of an Escherichia coli cell, whereas other macromolecules such as DNA and RNA make up only 3% and 20%, respectively. The set of proteins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as its proteome.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} that are encoded {{directly}} by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids. A modified form of methionine (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are called non-standard or non-canonical. Most of the non-standard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but {{two of them are}} proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not <b>encoded</b> <b>in</b> the universal genetic code.|$|E

5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein {{is defined by the}} sequence of a gene, which is <b>encoded</b> <b>in</b> the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E

5|$|How life {{originated}} from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short self-replicating RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been <b>encoded</b> <b>in</b> their individual nucleotide sequences.|$|E
5|$|In 1624, a {{fatality}} occurred {{following a}} match on Saturday, 28 August, at Horsted Keynes, now in East Sussex. A fielder called Jasper Vinall was struck {{on the head}} by the batsman, Edward Tye, {{who was trying to}} hit the ball a second time to avoid being caught. Vinall, who died thirteen days later at home in West Hoathly, is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality. The matter was recorded in a coroner's court, which returned a verdict of death by misadventure. The tragedy was repeated in 1647 when another fatality was recorded at Selsey, now in West Sussex, a player called Henry Brand being hit on the head by a batsman trying to hit the ball a second time. When the first Laws of Cricket were <b>encoded</b> <b>in</b> 1744, it was illegal to hit the ball twice and a batsman breaking the rule was to be given out. The record of the 1624 case confirms that two villages, Horsted Keynes and West Hoathly, were involved in the match and provides further evidence of the growth of village cricket.|$|E
