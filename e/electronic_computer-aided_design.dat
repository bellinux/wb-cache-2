40|$|The authors {{describe}} the dynamic modelling of a high-frequency operated fluorescent lamp in an electronic ballast environment. The model inherently includes the negative resistive characteristic, allows {{the study of}} electronic ballast design using series resonant converters, and can provide useful information for the optimisation of the electronic ballast design. The fluorescent lamp model for high-frequency operation has been developed and implemented. Predictions for the lamp system operation generally agree very well with measurements obtained from a 33 kHz electronic ballast - fluorescent lamp system. The use of {{the model for the}} designing the ballast components is illustrated.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{magnetic}} ballasts for high-voltage T 5 lamps {{are not only}} feasible but their luminous and ballast-loss performance can be better than those of <b>electronic</b> ballasts. A <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> and practical implementation of an ultra-low-loss magnetic ballast system for T 5 28 W lamps is presented. The high-voltage & low-current features of T 5 lamps imply that the copper and core losses of the magnetic ballast can be greatly reduced. Its total system power is 30 W (with a ballast loss of only 2. 42 W) {{is less than the}} 32 W upper limit specified for Class A 2 of energy-efficient electronic ballast for T 5 28 W lamps. High luminous efficacy of 74. 8 lumen/W can be achieved. This important breakthrough has the potential of reversing the existing trend of using electronic ballasts as the energy-saving technology in lighting industry. With a better luminous efficacy, lower product and maintenance costs, much longer lifetime and the use of recyclable metallic materials over its electronic counterparts, this patent-pending proposal provides a truly sustainable lighting solution to the lighting industry. © 2010 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{extensions}} to the MultiView object-oriented database view system that improve {{its ability to}} integrate <b>electronic</b> <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> (ECAD) tools. Using an object-preserving algebra as the view definition language, the MultiView system supports data transformations to suit the needs of individual tools. However, an object-preserving algebra alone is not powerful enough to express recursive transformations such as transitive path derivations and the flattening of hierarchical structures. In order to provide these capabilities, we extend the view definition language with operators that permit complex transformations of the data. To achieve performance essential for ECAD tools, we introduce the mediator class as a general strategy for the materialization of these complex views. We compare the bounds on query and update performance of our set-based mediator class for the symmetric transitive closure with a more traditional object-based materialization strategy [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Carrier {{diffusion}} {{and spatial}} hole burning {{can have a}} severe impact on vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) performance. In particular, these phenomena can produce secondary pulses, bumps, and optical tails in the VCSEL turn-off transient which limit both the system bit rate and the bit error rate (BER). To study these effects, laser rate equation models that include both spatial and temporal dependence are often employed; however, simulations which require discretization of both space and time, while accurate, typically consume vast amounts of computational power. In this paper, we demonstrate that models based on well-accepted spatially independent rate equations {{can be used to}} simulate these effects. These models exhibit the advantages of the full spatio-temporal approach but execute much more quickly. We also integrate these models into <b>electronic</b> <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> (CAD) tools which will enable circuit and system designers to simultaneously simulate electrical and optical performance...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} in having reduced scale drawings in <b>electronic</b> <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> (CAD) format rather than hard copies only. A knowledge-based text understanding system is {{proposed for the}} automatic conversion of paper-based reduced scale drawings to their CAD form. To recognize individual handwritten characters and symbols, an off-line OCR-module is integrated in this investigation. The OCR module is effectuated via a decision tree, consisting of training phase and recognition phase. The training phase aims at creating an object-oriented decision tree classifier. For this purpose, a structure-parameter-adaptive training strategy is used for creating the fundamental decision tree. The entire classifier is composed of a few separate subtrees, {{each of which is}} a sub-classifier for some special pattern category and effectuated with a Kohonen self-organizing feature map. Multilayer perceptron with error-backpropagation training is investigated for discriminating between similar characters. After training, the classifier is ready to recognize an unseen pattern. The recognition of an unknown pattern corresponds to a hybrid searching procedure. A two-stage search algorithm is developed. The first stage is based upon the probabilistic neural network whereas the second one is based upon fuzzy logic. Feed forward perceptron is started when the final winner cluster resulting from the fundamental search algorithm contains more than one character class. Based solely on the bitmap of the unknown pattern, three alternative character classes, together with a confidence value indicating certainty for each, are supplied. (orig.)

40|$|The {{pairing of}} <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> and {{geographical}} information system data creates an opportunity to connect an architectural design process with a robust analysis of its environmental constraints. Yet, the {{geographical information system}} data may be too overwhelmingly complex to be fully used in <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> without computer-assisted methods of filtering relevant information. This article reports on the implementation of an integrated environment for three-dimensional <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> and environmental impact. The project focused on a two-way data exchange between geographical information system and <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> in building design. While the two different technologies may rely on separate representational models, in combination they can provide a more complete view of the natural and built environment. The challenge in integration is that of bridging the differences in analytical methods and database formats. Our approach is rooted in part in constraint-based design methods, well established in <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> (e. g. Sketchpad, Generative Components, and computer-aided three-dimensional interactive application). Within such <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> systems, geometrical transformations may be intentionally constrained to help enforce a set of design determinants.
