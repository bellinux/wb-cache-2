40|$|A multi-criteria {{model for}} {{determining}} the order size for materials used in production has been presented. It was assumed that the consumption rate of each material is a random variable with a known probability distribution. Using such a model, in which the purchase cost of materials ordered is limited, three criteria were considered: order size, probability {{of a lack of}} materials in the production process, and deviations in the order size from the consumption rate in past periods. Based on an example, it has been shown how to use the model to determine the order sizes for polyurethane adhesive and wood in a <b>hard-coal</b> <b>mine.</b> (original abstract...|$|E

We show how CO-concentrations can be forecast by appropriate models of the physical and chemical processes. We furthermore describe a rule-based specification system utilizing forecasting for CO-monitoring. The improvement of this approach over the conventional is threefold. First, the number of false alarms is reduced by 50 %, at least. Simultaneously, the thresholds for warnings and alarms can be reduced so that, second, the detection of real fires becomes both quicker and more reliable. Third, heuristic rules for fire detection and suppression of false alarms as well as the control of the forecasting can be described in a declarative way.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the results of studies carried on in the frame of conceptual, multi-variant dewatering project for the <b>hard-coal</b> <b>mines</b> of the so-called Sosnowiec sub-system. The project ensures the safety existence of the adjacent mines. Several hydrogeological and mining-engineering factors have been taken into consideration, the multi-year inflow statistics were analyzed for the individual mines together with the technical conditions of existing dewatering systems and hydraulic connections between the mines. The project contains the concept of an in-coming dewatering system of the Sosnowiec Mine referred to the changes in dewatering systems of the Saturn and Paris mines, and to the results of closure of the Porąbka-Klimontów Mine. The mathematical model was applied to calculate the prognosed inflow rates. Results of three selected variants were characterized in details and preliminary timing of mine flooding was calculated. The best solution of dewatering problem of the mines belonging to the so-called Sosnowiec sub-system is the variant 1. In comparison with the current system, the solution proposes the replacement of stationary dewatering installations at the Paris, Sosnowiec and Porąbka-Klimontów mines by the submersible pumps installed in the shafts. The main dewatering system of the Kazimierz-Juliusz Mine would remain unchanged. The volume of waters derived from the regional dewatering of mines and discharged to surficial flows will decrease. Also the costs of dewatering of the closed and remediated mines will be significantly reduced. The submersible pumping system will enable the reduction of the staff which will be employed on the surface and the ventilation of closed mine will be eliminated...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{classification}} system for German coal mining {{is the result}} of approximately 100 years of experience in roadway development and longwall mining. It is also based on different research projects covered by national and European research programs. Over the past 30 years, more then 600, 000 m of road-ways have been driven and employed for mining activities. To properly describe the German rock mass {{classification system}}, therefore, it is useful {{to take a look at}} the main geomechanical preferences and common support systems. The decision about the most effective development technique and support system is based on a synthesis of rock mass classification and geomechanical analysis. The properties of surrounding rock, the in situ stress, and the influence of mining activities in several seams at each German mine must be considered for the evaluation of the expected deformation of the roadway. The mine layout, the requirements of ventilation and fire prevention, as well as the need to maintain emergency escape routes for the miners, require that the gate roads remain usable after the passage of the longwall face in most cases. Moreover, the gate roads must be maintained despite the high stresses that are applied during longwall retreat mining. Therefore, gate road design must address a broad spectrum of potential deformation environments. In the past, when gate roads were supported solely with yielding steel arches, lithologic descriptions of the surrounding strata conditions were adequate for the dimensioning of support and the prediction of the roadway deformation. The current conditions of multiple-seam mining at depths of up to 1, 700 m require combined support systems, including pattern bolting and backfilled steel arches. Rock bolt support is used for development, after which (typically 50 - 100 m outby the face) the steel arches are installed and backfilled with building material (concrete) in order to achieve an optimized development rate. The rock mass classification system described below was developed especially for the conditions of German <b>hard-coal</b> <b>mining.</b> It includes the stress distribution caused by multiseam workings (including crossing goaf edges of former longwalls), as well as in situ stresses due to greatdepth and the presence of tectonic faults. It is based on the evaluation of four parameters: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Geotechnical analysis of drill cores 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Geotechnical observation of the development face 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Geotechnical classification of tectonic structures (faults) 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Standard classification derived from geotechnical assessment and evaluation of stress conditions (using numerical modeling for stress calculation) ROCK STRENGTH One of the most important input parameters for describing strata conditions is the strength of the rock. The German classification system is based on a description of lithotypes. This method has been used successfully since the 1950 s and is based mainly on the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of the material. An evaluation of the rock strength observed in a survey of approximately 82, 500 samples of rock core yielded the results shown in Figure 1. The three most common coal measure rock types are mudstone, siltstone, and sandstone. Each shows a specific mean UCS level and a different spread between the minimum and maximum values. Sandstones, in particular, have a wide spectrum of compressive strength, ranging from approximately 40 MPa to greater than 130 MPa, with an average of 85 MPa. The causes of this wide range include different sedimento-logical preconditions, facies, and digenetic processes. [...|$|R
