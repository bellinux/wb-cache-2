5|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the {{building}} was dedicated to public access and use. It is entered via wide steps under columns that are three- or four-storeys high, and these pilotis {{create a sense of}} space for the naturally ventilated public lobby areas.

5|$|A line to Horsham, {{now part}} of the Arun Valley Line, was opened on 14 February 1848. A station was {{provided}} next to Crawley High Street from that date. A new station was constructed slightly to the east, in conjunction with the Overline House commercial development, and replaced the original station which closed on 28 July 1968.

5|$|By mid-August 1942, Stanley had {{recovered}} {{enough to be}} moved to the dysentery wing at Block 151 of Roberts Barracks. Padres Chambers and Payne had heard that Stanley had decorated the prisoners' chapel at Bukit Batok. So they {{asked him if he}} would do some paintings for St Luke's Chapel, which was recently converted from the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> Block 151, near the area where Stanley was recuperating. The Chapel was dedicated to St Luke the Physician. Stanley agreed, and sought inspiration for the proposed paintings in the Gospels.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the keep– made of {{hardened}} gravel– was dug up, {{probably to}} reuse for surfacing roads or pathways. The apartments in the forebuilding were abandoned and {{this part of}} the keep fell into decay as well. In 1644, the lands surrounding the castle were disparked, bringing an end to Castle Rising Chase. In 1705 stone was stripped from the castle to help repair a nearby sluice gate.|$|E

She was by then over fifty years old.|$|E

5|$|The {{circular}} keep {{was turned}} into a Martello tower, a type of Napoleonic artillery fortification. It was now only two storeys tall, although remaining original interior walls and doorways largely survived untouched. It was accessed on the first floor via an unusual sliding drawbridge, which was supported on rails and could retract into the floor, and the different storeys were linked by a spiral staircase. The <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the keep included a brick-built magazine, and the roof, supported by a central pillar running up through the building, held a single, large gun emplacement.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> {{the monastery}} is where ritual dances are performed. The {{walls of the}} monastery also have a profusion of thangkas of Buddhist deities and saints.

Within the precincts of the monastery there are residential buildings to accommodate about 700 monks, which now houses 450 monks. The abbot of the monastery resides in a house located near the gate at the southeastern corner of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|There is a ring {{of eight}} bells hung in an iron frame in the tower; they are rung from the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the tower. Five of the bells were cast in 1741 by Abel Rudhall of Gloucester. They were rehung in 1908. The sixth bell was recast in 1865 by Mears and Co. of London. In 1919, the church bells were still customarily rung to signal the town curfew between September and March. Two more bells were added in 1937, cast by Mears and Stainbank.|$|E

5|$|Towers A and B {{are very}} similar to each other. All rooms in both towers are doubles, meaning that two people share each room. There is a lounge the size of three dorm rooms every third floor, {{containing}} a large television and several couches and tables for studying. Communal and university-sponsored events frequently take place in the various lounges throughout the towers. Every floor shares a communal bathroom, with several shower and restroom stalls. Each floor has twenty rooms, except for the lounge floors, which only have seventeen. Each floor's resident assistant lives alone in their respective room, meaning each floor houses 39 people. On the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> Tower A there is a small fitness center containing treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and weight equipment. A fully functioning post office and all student mailboxes are located on the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> Tower B. Due to the fact that both Towers A and B are exclusively residences for first year students, they are both designated as alcohol-free. Its distribution, sale, and consumption, is punished if discovered.|$|E
5|$|A fire {{swept through}} Westminster in 1834, {{destroying}} {{most of the}} old palace, but the Jewel Tower, which was separated from the main fire and was positioned away from the prevailing wind, survived, along with its store of records from the House of Lords. Westminster was rebuilt, and in 1864 substantial changes were made at the tower: the Parliamentary records in the tower were moved to a fire-proof storage facility at the new Victoria Tower; 6–7 Old Palace Yard ceased {{to be used by}} the clerk as a house, and the kitchen in the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the tower was closed. Around this time, the tower began to be called the Jewel Tower once again, partially in the incorrect belief that it had held the Crown Jewels during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– {{just a piece of}} the west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, although there are no hinges for gates. The base of a garderobe demonstrates that second storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|E
50|$|Construction of Unit 3 {{commenced}} in 1934, using day labour, and {{was finished}} by 1937.
