The Web browser was built from the GTK Web browser Dillo, {{which is a}} free software project {{in terms of the}} GNU general public license. Additional functionality has been introduced to this original browser in form of different mod-ules. The browser operates in two different modes, brows-ing mode and <b>dialogue</b> <b>mode.</b> In browsing mode user navi-gates through structure of Web pages using mouse and/or key-board. When in <b>dialogue</b> <b>mode,</b> the dialogue module offers different actions and the user chooses between them using ei-ther keyboard or spoken-commands which are recognized by the speech-recognition module. The content of the page is pre-sented to the user by screen-reader module which uses text-to-speech module for its output. The browser is capable of displaying all common Web pages that do not contain frames, java or flash animations. How-ever, the best performance is achieved when pages comply with the recommendations set by the WAI. The browser has been developed in Linux operating sys-tem and later ported to Windows 9 x/ME/NT/ 2000 /XP platform. Currently it is being tested by members of the Slovenian blind people society.

40|$|Summary. Consider {{the basic}} problem to query the {{database}} for the physical effects of the data. Technical problem may be simplistically represented as three components: the initial state, the end result, the process of converting the initial state to the final result. The problem arises if {{at least one of}} the components is unknown. Discarding cases where all the components are known, or all of the components are not known, we obtain a classification of technical problems, consisting of six types. In forming a set of queries to the database is a natural requirement for completeness of this set, i. e. Requests should be set to cover the technical challenges of all six types. With a view to the formulation of a complete set of queries we draw an analogy between the description of the technical problem and a description of the physical effect. Let us compare the initial state of the physical input action effect, the end result - the output of, the process of transformation of the initial state to the final result - a physical object or a sequence of physical effects.

40|$|The {{statistical}} mentor system {{incorporates a}} knowledge base into an educational tool for novices in statistical decision making {{to use in}} choosing a statistical technique. The novices are students in a business school curriculum who are expected to learn the basic statistical processes in business applications. The purpose {{of the system is}} to stimulate learning of the data analysis process {{on the part of the}} novice, usually a difficult task. The system acts as a consultant to the novice and approaches the task using a top-down problem solving strategy rather than the traditional bottom-up strategy used by novices. The heart of the system is the rule base for differentiating between statistics. These rules were built by gathering expertise from two experts in statistical analysis. The rules are based on five questions which the data can answer, as well as the type of data, the number of variables, and any dependent/independent relationships which exist between the variables. The knowledge base consists of five rule sets and can be represented either by condition/conclusion rules or by a set of multi-dimensional tables. Twenty-nine statistics and the rules for choosing them are in the rules sets. The knowledge base was used to define the logic incorporated in the consultant system in order to aid the user in selecting a correct technique. A <b>dialogue</b> <b>mode</b> is employed in the consultant to determine which conditions are true for the problem and data set. The rule sets are then checked to find the conclusion satisfying the conditions. The computer mentor was tested against the usual textbook mentor method (search through a textbook until one finds a statistic that looks promising) with two different groups of subjects, 25 undergraduates and 19 doctoral students. The results were that the computer-assisted students in both samples correctly solved a larger proportion of problems and had a higher average number of problems correct than did the textbook assisted groups...|$|E
40|$|In my {{investigation}} {{of the use of}} the perfect (part I) and of hyperbaton (part II) I address a cross-section of syntactical questions which reflect elements of the language of drama, of New Comedy, {{of the end of the}} classical period, of verse, and of a conversational register in a literary dialogue form at times naturalistic, and at others conventional, rhetorical, or formulaic. 1. I describe the use of the perfect indicative in Menander from various angles including a survey of the perfects found in Menander from verbs which were not previously attested in the perfect (1. 7); the notion of innovation is challenged in the face of the accident of attestation and the different genres of the different sources, and I refer to the general problems of studying a dead language. In the following section I describe the typical use of perfects by grammatical categories (2. 1), and extra- grammatical categories including discourse mode, sentence-type and non-hypotactic dependence (2. 2), and lexical criteria (2. 3). In the taxonomy of my description and in my analysis I apply the principle that verbal categories and their morphological manifestations are fluid and complex rather than discrete. For example, in my attempt to understand the use of the temporal value of the perfect I take into account compositional elements such as the use of adverbs (2. 1. 5); for mood, I try to illustrate the illocutionary wealth of the perfect indicative (2. 2. 2) and relate this to the relative absence of non-indicative perfect forms (2. 1. 3) as well as to the frequency of perfects in <b>dialogue</b> <b>mode</b> (2. 2. 1). The principle of the integration of categories, grammatical and metagrammatical, is seen in the correlation between the low incidence of perfects in subordinate clauses (4) and the exposure of other mechanisms for dependence (2. 2. 3) which are a particularly salient feature of the dialogue mode: dependence may be logical, or communicational ('stimulus and response' 2. 2. 3 b). Along with (2. 2. 3), and hypotactic subordination (4), I also consider the transitivity of the perfect (3), not only an exercise in description, but in order to argue that in Menander's time (and genre etc.) perfects are less often transitively used than not; I show that examples with direct objects display weak transitivity (3. 2. 1, 3. 2. 4). A relatively weak transitive use supports (although is not synonymous with) the argument that these are not 'resultative' perfects in the sense that they approach aorists. My primary aim is to describe the workings of the perfect and its syntactic environment in Menander, and not to enter into the controversy over the chronology of the resultative perfect. However, evidence points to Menander's retaining a classical use of the perfect quite distinct from the aorist: the perfect is not used as a narrative tense (5), and when it is found in narrative passages it either exits the narrative frame or serves as a border or as a rhetorical or structural 'signpost'. In (5) I also discuss some narrative patterns which are typical of New Comedy, and the consistent use of perfects in direct speech within a past setting. 2. Greek word order is 'free but not arbitrary', to quote Marouzeau. One of the less arbitrary features is the tendency for certain modifiers to be adjacent to their head noun. In part III examine the separation of four modifiers from the substantives they modify: numerals (2). indefinites (3), possessives (4) and the demonstrative OUTOC (5). I move from the inherently most closely cohering (numerals) to the most loosely (demonstratives are often interpreted as being in an appositive or predicative rather than an attributive relation). The enclitic forms, especially of possessives (4. 3), are more closely studied since they are also used in later classical Greek as an alternative to the dative forms of the enclitic pronouns in the 'sympathetic' function. In such cases (as with 'loose' demonstratives) the affiliation of the genitive enclitic must be reassessed. As an exercise in description, and in the principle of cumulative evidence, I try to interpret the effect created by the use of hyperbaton in terms of degrees of nuance, emotion, and disruption to the sentence. The nature of the intervening element and the structure of the rest of the sentence are important factors. In Menander's genre certain contexts recur, and certain nuances, tones and attitudes tend to be emphasized. </p...|$|E
