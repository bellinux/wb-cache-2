Purple Tentacle arrives, hijacks a Chron-o-John and takes it to the previous day {{to prevent them from}} turning off the sludge machine; he is pursued by Green Tentacle in another pod.Laverne: Uh-oh!Green Tentacle: Don't worry guys! This time <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> stop him!}} With only one Chron-o-John pod left, Bernard, Hoagie and Laverne use it to pursue the tentacles to the previous day, while Dr. Fred uselessly tries to warn them of using the pod together, referencing the film The Fly. Upon arriving, the trio exit the pod only to discover that they have been turned into a three-headed monster, their bodies merging into one during the transfer. Meanwhile, Purple Tentacle has used the time machine to bring countless versions of himself from different moments in time to the same day to prevent the Sludge-o-Matic from being deactivated. Bernard and his friends defeat the Purple Tentacles guarding the Sludge-o-Matic, turn off the machine and prevent the whole series of events from ever happening. Returning to the present, Dr. Fred discovers that the three have not been turned into a monster at all but have just gotten stuck in the same set of clothes; they are then ordered by Dr. Fred to get out of his house. The game ends with the credits rolling over a tentacle-shaped American flag, one of the more significant results of their tampering in history.|$|E
500|$|Hundreds {{of actors}} sought the main {{roles in the}} film, {{including}} Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman and Richard Gere for Jacob, and Andie MacDowell, Julia Roberts and Madonna for Jezzie. Eventually, Tim Robbins and Elizabeth Peña were cast; both auditioned early and {{neither of them had}} starred in a feature film before. Robbins said the film presented for him [...] "a great opportunity to go in a different direction. I love doing comedy, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do other things as well." [...] The film's military advisor was Vietnam veteran Captain Dale Dye, who provided a five-day boot camp military training for the actors playing soldiers in the Vietnam storyline (including Robbins, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Eriq La Salle and Ving Rhames).|$|E
500|$|The theme music, [...] "Whatever It Takes", was {{composed}} by Jim McGrath, with lyrics written by Jody Colero and Stephen Stohn. The song include lines such as, [...] "Whatever it takes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make it through/Be the best, the best I can be", to convey what Colero calls, [...] "a sense {{of joy and}} optimism." [...] Lisa Dalbello performed the lyrics with a children's choir over an 1980s pop music style tune {{during the first three}} seasons. Dave Ogilvie and Anthony Valcic of Canadian industrial-pop group Jakalope reworked and performed the song with a heavier sound, reflecting the growing maturity of the characters in season four. For seasons six and seven, the theme—still performed by Jakalope—was remixed and stripped of vocals. A fourth version of the theme song, with lyrics sung by Damhnait Doyle, was introduced for the eighth season, and a fifth version of the theme, performed by the in-show band [...] "" [...] is used for the ninth and tenth seasons. For seasons eleven and twelve, a sixth version of the theme song is used, performed by Alexz Johnson. Seasons thirteen and fourteen featured a truncated version of the Alexz Johnson theme.|$|E

500|$|Saadiq {{recorded}} {{mostly at}} Blakeslee Recording Company; Additional sessions {{took place at}} Harmonie Park Studios in Detroit and The Music Shed Studios in New Orleans. While recording, he immersed himself in a composite character of classic soul singers from videos he watched, including Al Green, Gladys Knight & the Pips, the Four Tops, and the Temptations. He recorded his vocals with only Brungardt present in the studio, a preference he felt prevented him from [...] "looking for answers from somebody who may not really know". Saadiq said he tended to [...] "record complete takes, and if something isn't quite right but it's got a feel that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never ever capture again, I'll leave it, even if it's flat. I mean, there are flat parts on my record, because it's not about perfection, it's about the soul." [...] He recorded background vocals for all songs. Saadiq played most of the instruments, including drums, guitar, piano, sitar, and bass guitar, his instrument of choice throughout his career. He viewed the bass playing of James Jamerson {{as an integral part}} of Motown recordings, citing it as the inspiration for his own bass sound on the album.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by {{this early}} success, Kubrick {{quit his job}} at Look and visited {{professional}} filmmakers in New York City, asking many detailed questions about {{the technical aspects of}} film-making. He stated that he was given the confidence during this period to become a filmmaker {{because of the number of}} bad films he had seen, remarking, [...] "I don't know a goddamn thing about movies, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make a better film than that". He began making Flying Padre (1951), a film which documents Reverend Fred Stadtmueller, who travels some 4,000 miles to visit his 11 churches. The film was originally going to be called [...] "Sky Pilot", a pun on the slang term for a priest. [...] During the course of the film, the priest performs a burial service, confronts a boy bullying a girl, and makes an emergency flight to aid a sick mother and baby into an ambulance. Several of the views from and of the plane in Flying Padre are later echoed in [...] (1968) with the footage of the spacecraft, and a series of close-ups on the faces of people attending the funeral were most likely inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin (1925) and Ivan the Terrible (1944/1958).|$|E
500|$|Vlasic {{spent the}} 1989 {{off-season}} recovering form his injury, while the Chargers added another quarterback to the roster upon drafting Billy Joe Tolliver. After {{working out with}} the team during the preseason, he started the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list. With the Chargers having a reliable starter in Jim McMahon, who had been signed to the team, Vlasic was kept on the list for the season. In 1990, McMahon was released and John Friesz was drafted out of the University of Idaho, leaving Vlasic to compete with Friesz and David Archer for the backup quarterback job. As the preseason began for the 1990 San Diego Chargers season, the team released Archer, and the plan was for Friesz to split backup quarterback duties during the preseason. After an impressive preseason by Vlasic and only a pedestrian one by Tolliver, Chargers coach Dan Henning named Vlasic as the starting quarterback against the Dallas Cowboys in the season opener, citing that he was [...] "steadier" [...] than Tolliver. After losing the game 1714, the switch was made back to Tolliver as the starting quarterback, and was eventually named starter {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite this, Vlasic remained optimistic, saying, [...] "I feel confident in my ability, and I always have. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get the job done whatever the situation. I have to believe that." [...] Over the course of the 1990 season, Vlasic played in six games, completing 19 of 40 passes for 168 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 46.7.|$|E

By contrast, Lieutenant General William Robertson, another British officer, thought that Foch was [...] "rather a flat-catcher, a mere professor, and very talkative" [...] (28 September 1915).|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} to Lancashire from Leicestershire, manager Mike Watkinson was {{impressed}} by Smith's performances with the bat and ball. Smith's contract with the club was renewed, along with nine other young players who were expected to {{form the basis of}} Lancashire's squad in the future. Smith stated his intent to cement his place in the Lancashire side as an all-rounder, saying that [...] "My batting has come on in leaps and I would like to think of myself as more of an allrounder. I batted in the top six at Leicestershire in the limited-over games and at seven in the four-dayers, and I got 50-plus {{a couple of times and}} had a run average of about 40.

2500|$|In {{the vault}} final, Maroney won {{a silver medal}} with a score of 15.083. She {{performed}} an Amanar for her first vault but fell on her second. This fall ended her 33-vault hitting streak in competition. Even with the fall, Maroney still came in second. She said, [...] "I didn't get my full block, my hands didn't really touch the vault. I still walked out with a silver medal and I'm happy about that. I'll have to watch the video {{and figure out what}} happened. It's really sad that I had to fall on that vault but I'm glad I won a silver medal. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do better vaults but I also know I didn't deserve the gold medal because I fell on my second vault.

2500|$|Senna also raced in two {{high-profile}} non-Formula One {{races in}} 1984: the ADAC 1000-km Nürburgring where, alongside Henri Pescarolo and Stefan Johansson, he co-drove a Joest Racing Porsche 956 to finish 8th, {{as well as}} an exhibition race to celebrate the opening of the new Nürburgring before the European Grand Prix. Notably, this race involved several past and present Formula 1 drivers, including Stirling Moss and past World Champions Jack Brabham, Denny Hulme and Alan Jones, driving identical Mercedes 190E 2.3–16 sports cars. Alain Prost started from pole position, but Senna took the lead in the first corner of the first lap, winning ahead of Niki Lauda and Carlos Reutemann. After the race, Senna was quoted as saying, [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do it." [...] Senna was a last-minute inclusion in the Mercedes race, taking over from Emerson Fittipaldi.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of her second album Mistaken Identity in 2004, Delta {{reflected}} that the album was rushed – written and recorded {{while she was still}} recovering from chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Goodrem remarked that she felt overexposed and claimed, [...] "I'd burnt myself out. By the end of 'Mistaken Identity' I thought, 'This is nothing of what I am. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do all of this a lot better'." [...] After a period of being angry, Delta felt she was healed and embraced herself and being in the public eye. Therefore, she started developing a new album, stating, [...] "For a while I was writing songs for this album I didn't want to talk about things, so I didn't want to write about them either. [...] "I had to get over a couple of things. My parents divorced, there was a lot going on. But now I truly am inspired again. I feel regenerated. I feel I've got my energy back." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of July, Maroney competed at the Olympic Trials in San Jose, California. [...] After {{the first day of}} competition she said, [...] "I'm thankful that I'm even here. I knew I had to hit vault because it's the most important event for me to make the Olympic team." [...] Though she had falls on both bars and beam on day one, and a major loss of formation on bars during day two, she placed seventh in the all-around with a two-day combined score of 117.650. In event finals, she placed first on vault scoring 31.700 and fifth on floor scoring 29.700. Afterwards, Maroney was chosen {{as a member of the}} team that was sent to the 2012 Summer Olympics. [...] She said, [...] "This is the best feeling – it's just so amazing. I'm in shock right now. I think this will be the happiest I'll ever be in my life. [...] It's the absolute best feeling knowing that I trained so hard for this and all the hard things that I have accomplished and now to be on this team. [...] These girls are my best friends. [...] My team mate Kyla Ross, we have been best friends since we were six years old so it's just absolutely amazing to be going to the Olympics." [...] When asked about feeling pressure to win gold on vault at the Olympics, she replied, [...] "If I do my job <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get the gold medal.

2500|$|At the {{previous}} race in Italy, {{the gap between}} Rosberg and Hamilton had closed by seven points. Hamilton had started from pole position ahead of Rosberg, but had a poor start off the line and fell to fourth. He retook the lead after Rosberg braked late and went straight on at the first turn and used the escape road to rejoin the track. Hamilton remained the lead {{for the rest of}} the race to win. With six races left in the season, Hamilton was aware he could not lose any further ground to Rosberg in the championship battle and was pleased to make an improvement after his Monza victory: [...] "Despite the highs and lows, I'm still well and truly in the hunt for the championship and that is something that gives me huge motivation for the final six races - starting in Singapore." [...] Rosberg admitted Hamilton's form and past experience in championship battles could possibly be advantageous but it was something the latter was not concerned over and would focus on himself: [...] "At the moment, I am enjoying the moment more than I ever have in the sport because I get to a race and I have a car where <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be on pole and I can win," [...] Ricciardo stated that while he was aware his chances of winning the championship were not realistic, he would take a race-by-race approach, and hoped to win either of the season's next two races to draw closer in the title battle: [...] "All it takes is a couple of wins and a couple of bad races for the championship leader, and all of a sudden everything's possible again. So let's see what happens." ...|$|E
