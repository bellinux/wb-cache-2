Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs {{are referred to}} as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned wastewater treatment works. Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts of sewage sludge. Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of sludge per million liters of wastewater that is treated. Primary sludge water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces sewage sludge that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems. Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces sludge that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of sludge. Methods of use and disposal of sewage sludge include the following: Application of sludge to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; sale or give-away of sludge for use in home gardens; <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of sludge. Managing quality of sewage sludge not only involves wastewater reduction and separation of contaminated waste from non-contaminants but also pretreatment of non-domestic wastewater.

Research shows that triclocarban and triclosan have been detected in sewage effluents and sludge (biosolids) due to their incomplete removal during wastewater treatment. Due to their hydrophobic nature, significant amounts of them in wastewater streams partition into sludge, with concentrations at mg/kg levels. The volume of triclocarban reentering the environment in sewage sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is s 127,000 ± 194,000 kg/yr. This is equivalent to a 4.8 - 48.2% of its total U.S consumption volume. Crops shown to take up antimicrobials from soil include barley, meadow fescue, carrots and pinto beans. Studies show that substantial quantities of triclocarban (227,000 - 454,000 kg/y) can break through wastewater treatment plants and damage algae on surface waters.|$|E

Many cities in China {{are trying to}} find an appropriate method of achieving this. However, {{due to a lack of}} funding, technology and research, some methods suitable for local conditions are still not available, even in the most modern and biggest cities in China. This thesis is intended to describe the method used for the treatment and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> from industries now in Shanghai, Beijing and Chongqing. Compared with these three cities, Beijing produces more sludge per day, while Shanghai has the least sludge production. Further, the industrial waste piping system is not separated from the domestic system in these three cities. Moreover, the percentage of treated sludge is still very low in Shanghai, Beijing and Chongqing. Among these three cities, even the highest treatment rate of sludge is 35. 41 % (Beijing). The lowest is only 10. 08 % (Chongqing). Considering that much more sludge will be produced in the next a few years, the current situation in these three cities presents a stern challenge.

40|$|Odor is an {{unwanted}} consequence of municipal waste processing and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge.</b> Anaerobic digestion of sludge generates {{a broad range}} of odorants during the treatment process. In the first stage (acid fermentation), sugars, lipids, colloidal solids, and dissolved carbonaceous matter are converted to organic acids with the evolution of H 2 S and CO 2; pH drops during this stage. In the next stage (acid regression), the organic acids (formed in stage 1) along with some proteins are digested to acetate and ammonia compounds; pH rises slowly during this stage. In the third stage, pH rises to neutral (pH ≈ 7) with the generation of large volumes of gases, especially methane, that can be used as fuel. The resultant humic mass has more odor if thermophilic digestion rather than mesophilic digestion is used. The sludge is then stabilized by chlorine or lime to render the material less suitable for microbial growth. It is also heated to reduce the quantity of moisture. Composing of the material and other forms of treatment byproducts can also generate odor. Questions have been raised about the potential health effects of odors from wastewater treatment plants and the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge.</b> On April 16 - 17, 1998, a workshop sponsored by Duke University, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Institute o...|$|E
