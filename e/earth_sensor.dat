50|$|A {{horizon sensor}} is an optical {{instrument}} that detects {{light from the}} 'limb' of Earth's atmosphere, i.e., at the horizon. Thermal infrared sensing is often used, which senses the comparative warmth of the atmosphere, compared to the much colder cosmic background. This sensor provides orientation with respect to Earth about two orthogonal axes. It tends to be less precise than sensors based on stellar observation. Sometimes referred to as an <b>Earth</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E

40|$|Advances {{in earth}} {{observation}} technologies {{have led to}} the acquisition of vast volumes of accurate, timely and reliable environmental data which encompass a multitude of information about the land, ocean and atmosphere of the planet. <b>Earth</b> science <b>sensor</b> datasets capture multiple facets of information about natural processes and human activities that shape the physical landscape and environmental quality of our planet, and thus, offer an opportunity to monitor and understand the diverse phenomena affecting earth’s complex system. The monitoring, analysis and understanding of these rich sensor datasets is thus of prime importance for the efficient planning and management of critical resources, since the societal costs of mitigation or adaptation decisions for natural or human-induced adverse events are significant. Hence, a thorough understanding of <b>earth</b> science <b>sensor</b> datasets has a direct impact on a range of societally relevant issues. Moreover, <b>earth</b> science <b>sensor</b> datasets possess unique domain-specific properties that distinguish them from sensor datasets used in other domains, and thus demand the need for novel tools and techniques to be developed for their analysis, adhering to their characteristic issues and challenges. ...|$|R
50|$|Amos-1 {{measures}} 11.5 m {{in length}} {{in its final}} in-orbit configuration. It is 3-axis body stabilised using Sun and <b>Earth</b> <b>sensors,</b> momentum and reaction wheels. Its solar array generates 1380 W power, backed up by 24 A·h Ni-Cd batteries. After its launch, it was raised to its final geostationary orbit by firing the apogee boost motor in phases. After it reached the geostationary orbit, its antennae and solar panels were deployed and the satellite was placed in its allocated slot at 4° West longitude. Amos 1 and Amos 2 were placed near each other to enable satellite users to aim once and reach either satellite from the same antenna.|$|R
50|$|The {{mission was}} given the go-ahead by ESA in 1980, and launchedon an Ariane 1 rocket (flight V14) on 2 July 1985 from Kourou, French Guiana. The craft was {{controlled}} from the European Space Agency ESOC facilities in Darmstadt (then West Germany) initially in Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) then in the Near Earth Phase (NEP) before the longer Cruise Phase through to the encounter. While in GTO a number of slew and spin-up manoeuvres (to 90 RPM) were carried out {{in preparation for the}} firing of the Apogee Boost Motor (ABM), although unlike orbit circularisations for geostationary orbit, the ABM for Giotto was fired at perigee. Attitude determination and control used sun pulse and IR <b>Earth</b> <b>sensor</b> data in the telemetry to determine the spacecraft orientation.|$|E
50|$|On September 8 at 12:50 UTC, the {{spacecraft}} experienced {{a problem with}} attitude control. It automatically turned on the gyros, and the cruise science experiments were automatically turned off. The exact cause is unknown as attitude sensors went back to normal before telemetry measurements could be sampled, but {{it may have been}} an Earth-sensor malfunction or a collision with a small unidentified object which temporarily caused {{the spacecraft}} to lose Sun lock. A similar experience happened on September 29 at 14:34 UTC. Again, all sensors went back to normal before it could be determined which axis had lost lock. By this date, the <b>Earth</b> <b>sensor</b> brightness indication had essentially gone to zero. This time, however, telemetry data indicated that the Earth-brightness measurement had increased to the nominal value for that point in the trajectory.|$|E
50|$|Ranger 5 was a Block II Ranger {{spacecraft}} {{similar to}} Ranger 3 and Ranger 4.

A large high-gain dish antenna {{was attached to the}} base. Two wing-like solar panels (5.2 m across) were attached to the base and deployed early in the flight. Power was generated by 8680 solar cells contained in the solar panels which charged an 11.5 kg 1 kWh capacity AgZn launching and backup battery. Spacecraft control was provided by a solid-state digital computer and sequencer and an earth-controlled command system. Attitude control was provided by six Sun and one <b>Earth</b> <b>sensor,</b> gyroscopes, and pitch and roll cold nitrogen gas jets. The telemetry system aboard the spacecraft consisted of two 960 MHz transmitters, one at 3 W power output and the other at 50 mW power output, the high-gain antenna, and an omnidirectional antenna. White paint, gold and chrome plating, and a silvered plastic sheet encasing the retrorocket furnished thermal control.|$|E
50|$|The {{payload module}} also held a conical sun shade, to prevent stray light from {{reaching}} the telescope, and two large star trackers.

It consisted of Sun and <b>Earth</b> <b>sensors,</b> the before-mentioned star trackers, a quadrant star sensor on the telescope axis, gyroscopes and reaction wheels. A complementary reaction control system (RCS), using hydrazine propellant, was responsible for orbital direction and finetuning shortly after launch.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. Horizon sensing is an {{effective}} way to determine the pitch and roll of a LEO satellite and <b>Earth</b> horizon <b>sensors</b> that operate in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum are commonly used. These sensors have the disadvantage that they cannot operate when the satellite is in eclipse. <b>Earth</b> horizon <b>sensors</b> that operate in the infrared spectral range are a solution to take attitude measurements when the satellite is in eclipse. Until recently infrared detectors could only operate at very low temperatures and needed to be cryogenically cooled. The result was that their power consumption and physical characteristics (like dimensions and mass) were such that they were not suitable for use in small and medium LEO satellites. As a result of technology expansion in the field of infrared imagers the past few years, infrared imagers were developed which do not require cooling. The scope of this project was to develop and implement an <b>Earth</b> horizon <b>sensor</b> by using a low-cost, uncooled infrared imager. The performance and physical characteristics of various imager were evaluated and it was decided to select a low resolution thermopile imager mainly {{as a result of the}} cost limitations of the project. Software algorithms were then evaluated and selected for horizon detection and attitude determination. The <b>Earth</b> horizon <b>sensor</b> that was developed did not comply with the accuracy requirement (3 s < 0. 1 o) that was set for the project because of the low resolution of the sensor. Methods to improve the accuracy were investigated and finally a sub-pixel edge estimation algorithm was developed and implemented which resulted in an improvement of 69 % in the pitch accuracy and 49 % in roll accuracy. With the sub-pixel edge estimation algorithm implemented the horizon sensor almost met the accuracy requirements (s < 0. 0811 o for pitch and s < 0. 2944 o for roll). This project confirms that, with further improvement to the design and test facilities, developing a low-cost, uncooled infrared <b>Earth</b> horizon <b>sensor</b> that meets the accuracy requirements is feasible...|$|R
