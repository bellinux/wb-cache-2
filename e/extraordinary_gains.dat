A stranger, who might have belonged to that reckless epoch, and who bore every evidence of being a successful Pike County miner out on a [...] "spree," [...] appeared at one of the tables with a negro coachman bearing two heavy bags of gold. Selecting a faro-bank as his base of operations, he began to bet heavily and with apparent recklessness, until his play excited the breathless attention of every one. In a few moments he had won a sum variously estimated at from eighty to a hundred thousand dollars.

Located in the north-eastern of Spain, Priorat has been completely transformed from a forgotten land into a top quality wine production district, becoming the second Spanish region, after Rioja, to be awarded Denomination de Origen Calificada (DOCa) status. Previous studies about the Priorat have pointed out geographical and environmental reasons to explain regional success.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. The {{establishment}} of the Altx exchange provided the opportunity for investors to invest in small high growth companies which sometimes provide spectacular returns. The firms listed on the Altx JSE exchange have provided exceptional returns in the South African market {{over the last few}} years and in March 2007 the price earnings ratio on the Altx exchange was 1. 4 times that of the JSE main exchange. Investors wanting <b>extraordinary</b> <b>gains</b> would want to include these stocks in their portfolios, but a valid asset pricing model is needed for these assets to be considered for inclusion in a portfolio. Previous studies have shown that the traditional capital asset pricing model is difficult to apply to assets of this nature. Three widely. used models of increasing complexity are identified to be tested with securities listed on the AltX exchange. These models are the Capital Asset Pricing Model; the Fama-French Three Factor Model and the Arbitrage Pricing Theory. The predictive qualities, of all three models are evaluated using a Two Step Regression methodology. The first step entails a series of time series regressions that are used to determine the model factors. The predictive abilities of these factors in the models are evaluated using a second series of cross sectional regressions over all the companies. Yearly data from the period 2000 - 2007 is used in the empirical study. This is a very small amount of data and limits the applicability of the results obtained. None of the three models used passed all of the significance tests to show that their predictive qualities are valid. It does however seem from the R 2 values that the Fama-French Three Factor Model and Arbitrage Pricing Theorem describe much more of the variation in the expected returns of Altx listed stocks. It is suggested that these results are confirmed in future studies using more data. Master...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{multi-tool}} commercial/military environment combining software Domain Analysis techniques with Reusable Software and Reengineering of Legacy Software. It {{is based on the}} development of a military version for the Department of Defense (DOD). The integrated tools in the military version are: Software Specification Assistant (SSA) and Software Reengineering Environment (SRE), developed by Computer Command and Control Company (CCCC) for Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) and Joint Logistics Commanders (JLC), and the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) STARS Software Engineering Environment (SEE) developed by Boeing for NAVAIR PMA 205. The paper describes transitioning these integrated tools to commercial use. There is a critical need for the transition for the following reasons: First, to date, 70 percent of programmers' time is applied to software maintenance. The work of these users has not been facilitated by existing tools. The addition of Software Reengineering will also facilitate software maintenance and upgrading. In fact, the integrated tools will support the entire software life cycle. Second, the integrated tools are essential to Business Process Reengineering, which seeks radical process innovations to achieve breakthrough results. Done well, process reengineering delivers <b>extraordinary</b> <b>gains</b> in process speed, productivity and profitability. Most importantly, it discovers new opportunities for products and services in collaboration with other organizations. Legacy computer software must be changed rapidly to support innovative business processes. The integrated tools will provide commercial organizations important competitive advantages. This, in turn, will increase employment by creating new business opportunities. Third, the integrated system will produce much higher quality software than use of the tools separately. The {{reason for this is that}} producing or upgrading software requires keen understanding of extremely complex applications which is facilitated by the integrated tools. The radical savings in the time and cost associated with software, due to use of CASE tools that support combined Reuse of Software and Reengineering of Legacy Code, will add an important impetus to improving the automation of enterprises. This will be reflected in continuing operations, as well as in innovating new business processes. The proposed multi-tool software development is based on state of the art technology, which will be further advanced through the use of open systems for adding new tools and experience in their use...|$|E
40|$|It {{cannot be}} said that Adam Smith has {{developed}} a systematic commercial theory. But the influence that the classical Schools' economic theories have had on commercial theory cannot be easily ignored. In addition, the commercial theories developed in recent literatures have been derived largely from the value and price theories advanced by the School. Therefore, it is quite natural that the re-consideration of the economic theories {{should be given to}} the concepts formulated by the Classical Schools. In general Smith, Say, Ricardo, M'Culloch and Senior did not regard commercial theory as a separate and distinct discipline. (The Classical economists commonly used the term "commerce", instead of the term "marketing".) Smith's explanation of the economics of commerce stems mainly from the concept of "specialization", which is a major consideration in the thought of the Classical economists. Thus, commerce is drawn directly into the picture by the Classical writers and in the words of Smith : "Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes in some measure a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a commercial society. " The theory of commerce is, I believe, essentially a part of economics. However, most students of commerce (marketing) have shown little interest in commercial studies as an economic phenomenon. But recently the need for the economic analysis of distribution has been gradually felt by some students, especially by such English economists as M. Hall and H. Smith. This article aims to contribute to the formulation of a theory of commerce by tracing the development of theories of retail price determination. The first half of this article is devoted to a consideration of the ideas of commerce which were incorporated by A. Smith, J. B. Say and J. R. M'Culloch. Smith emphasizes the functions and the economic significance of the nature and process of commerce on grounds commonly accepted today, though his definition of commerce is very broad. He also justifies the existence of retailers and wholesalers on the basis of services they perform, considering them as the convenient sources of goods to the ultimate consumers. Furthermore he insists that the commercial activity is productive because it creates time and place utilities to commodities, and so retailing is looked upon as {{part of the process of}} production. In the latter half, of this article I shall try to explain the approach of the theory of commerce propounded by the Classical School. Smith asserted that perfect competition did prevail even in the retail market and that prices would exactly cover the costs of production, that is to say, retailer's margins would just cover the expences incurred. In fact, the retail trade in those times was carried out under conditions of perfect competition. Accordingly, he argued that it would be folly for government to regulate retail prices or numbers of retailers. In sum Smith acknowledged the following conditions as essential to competition; 1. Competitors act independently, not jointly. 2. The number of competitors is sufficient to eliminate <b>extraordinary</b> <b>gains.</b> 3. The economic units possess sufficient knowledge of the market opportunities. 4. There is freedom from social restraint in order to act on this knowledge. 5. Sufficient. time elapses for the resources to flow in the directions and quantities desired by their owners. We all recognize that the basic assumption of perfect competition has played a most important role in the establishment and the development of theoretical economics. In this way, the simplifying devices of assumption and abstraction are commonly used to aid generalization, as J. S. Mill indicates this premise is the first step toward the analysis of economic activities. But I should like to emphasize that if traditional economics holds too closely to such assumptions, it cannot fail to meet many difficulties in the advanced stages of analysis of economic reality. This is the reason that modern economists such as J. Robinson and E. H. Chamberline have offered new tools to analyse the complicated problems in the field of commerce by connecting separate area of pure competition with complete monopoly. Under perfect competition. As Smith thought, merchants could not have any active role in the exchange process in retail markets. This means that there is no room for an individual merchant to establish the price of a commodity by himself. Thus it would not be possible to detect the proper field of commerce. Smith's viewpoint of commerce nevertheless contains many implications that facilitate researches in this field...|$|E

The four chief asanas (siddha, padma, simha and bhadra) are mentioned, as are the obstacles encountered by beginners - sloth, talkativeness, etc. A description of pranayama follows, together with {{the definition of the}} matra (unit of measurement for the phases of respiration), and important details of mystical physiology (the purification of the nadis is shown by external signs: lightness of body, brilliance of complexion, increase in digestive power, etc. Mircea Eliadeon Yogatattva Upanishad ...|$|R
40|$|Estimates {{suggest that}} {{international}} reserves of the Eurosystem {{could be reduced}} by one third to half ($ 130 -$ 170 bill.) of its existing level after {{the introduction of the}} Euro. While the ultimate decision, whether and how to use these excessive reserves (public debt repayment, financing of a fund, financing of a tax cut) is a political one, some general results can be stated: First, since reserves earn interest revenue, a large part of which is transferred to the government anyway, moderate (but still positive) economic gains can be expected from a reserve reduction. Second, reserve reductions exceeding a certain threshold require the ECB's approval, which could, however, only be rejected if the envisaged measures were inconsistent with the ECB's monetary and exchange rate policy. Given that unintended macroeconomic effects can easily be avoided by a carefully planned and coordinated reserve reduction, such a rejection by the ECB - which is subject to the review by the European Court of Justice - is only hard to justify. Equally important from a legal point of view is that reserve reductions, effected as transfer of an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>gain</b> to the government, do not constitute monetary financing as prohibited under Art. 101 EC Treaty. Finally, reducing reserves to an adequate level would also eliminate incompatibilities and conflicts of interest between monetary and investment policy by the central banks and reduce their field of operation to their core task: the conduct of monetary policy. Thus, a carefully planned and coordinated reserve reduction can be supported from both an economic as well as legal point of view. Series: EI Working Papers / Europainstitu...|$|R
