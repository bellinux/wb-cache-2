50|$|Any key {{can also}} be {{programmed}} with a macro and can be combined with key modifiers Alt, and/or Ctrl (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+Q, Ctrl+Alt+F1). Macros are multiple presses of various keys in sequence of arbitrary length. The “extra” <b>F</b> <b>keys</b> on {{the left of the}} keyboard are essentially reserved for having macros programmed to them, though they mirror the function of the <b>F</b> <b>keys</b> {{along the top of the}} keyboard before they are programmed. The keyboard treats both sets of <b>F</b> <b>keys</b> as separate, however. Remapping or programming one of the <b>F</b> <b>keys</b> will not change the function of its counterpart.|$|R

50|$|The high <b>F</b> <b>key</b> {{also shows}} up on various serial number ranges, though some players believe that {{instruments}} without the high <b>F</b> <b>key</b> have better natural intonation. During the mid-1960s optional keywork was offered, including the rare 'Concert' model with a high F#, right hand G#, D to E flat trill key and C to D trill key using the E flat palm key. There are also somewhat rare low A alto and baritone models. The timbre on this instrument is very nice. The low A baritone is especially sought after, whereas the low A alto model is somewhat less desirable (which presumably suffered intonation issues). Nonetheless, Ornette Coleman played a low A alto.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{transposing}} {{instrument in}} the key of E, pitched an octave plus a major sixth lower than written. It is one octave lower than the alto saxophone. Modern baritones with a low A key and high <b>F</b> <b>key</b> have a range from C2 to A4. Adolphe Sax also produced a baritone saxophone in F intended for orchestral use, but these fell into disuse. As with all saxophones, its music is written in treble clef.|$|E

50|$|According to Andrew Tracey, marimbas were {{introduced}} to Zimbabwe in 1960. Zimbabwean marimba based upon Shona music has also become popular in the West, which adopted the original use of these instruments to play transcriptions of mbira dzavadzimu (as well as nyunga nyunga and matepe) music. The first of these transcriptions had originally been used for music education in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwean instruments are often in a diatonic C major scale, which allows them to be played with a 'western-tuned' mbira (G nyamaropa), sometimes with an added <b>F</b> <b>key</b> placed inline.|$|E
50|$|Pandemic Studios {{continued}} and expanded {{the concept of}} a RTS and FPS hybrid where the player drives the vehicle in the game, but using a mixture of the reticle and the space bar, selects units and buildings to build and orders units around the battle field. The <b>F</b> <b>keys</b> {{at the top of the}} keyboard were used to create groups of units for easy selection of the units presently on the battlefield when they were not in the range of the player to select via the spacebar.|$|R

50|$|A {{transposing}} instrument {{pitched in}} the key of B, modern soprano saxophones with a high <b>F</b> <b>key</b> have a range from A3 to E6 and are therefore pitched one octave above the tenor saxophone. Some saxophones have additional keys, allowing them to play an additional F and G {{at the top of}} the range. These extra keys are commonly found on more modern saxophones. Additionally, skilled players can make use of the altissimo register, which allows them to play even higher. There is also a soprano pitched in C, which is less common and until recently had not been made since around 1940.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to straight sopranos, {{there are also}} slightly and fully curved sopranos. The fully curved variety looks much like a small alto saxophone with a straighter crook. There is some debate over {{the effect of the}} straight and curved neck, with some players believing that a curved neck on a soprano gives it a warmer, less nasal tone. The soprano has all the keys of other saxophone models (with the exception of the extra 'A' on some baritones) and some (e.g. those made by Yanagisawa, Selmer, and Yamaha) may have a top 'G' key next to the <b>F</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{simple system}} flute had a {{cylindrical}} head joint and a reverse tapered body. The six main tone holes were heavily undercut to produce even intonation and registration while providing even finger spacing. French simple system flutes (or [...] "five-key flutes") from this era typically had five keys that enabled the flute {{to play in}} any key. English and German models were typically designed with eight keys: the five of the five-key flute, plus an alternate <b>F</b> <b>key</b> running along the instrument, and two keys on the foot joint to extend the lower register down to middle C.|$|E
50|$|The Second Corps of Discovery: 1811 Journal of the Jackson and Clark Expeditionary Force is a 2011 {{alternative}} history novel {{written by}} <b>F.</b> Scott <b>Key</b> and translated by Matsu Ri. It {{is presented in}} a chronicle format from the daily journal of <b>F.</b> Scott <b>Key,</b> who documented his involvement with the Expedition from 1811 to 1812. The story depicts a follow-up attempt to reach the Pacific Coast, after the original Lewis and Clark Expedition was considered lost.

5000|$|The AnyKey {{also has}} a user {{programmable}} repeat rate (the rate at which a key will repeat its function on the computer if it is held down) that is handled by the controller inside the board and therefore overrides the BIOS or operating system controlled repeat rate on the attached computer. The repeat rate is set by pressing the “Repeat Rate” key {{and then one of}} the top row <b>F</b> <b>keys,</b> with F1 being the slowest rate and F8 being the fastest - then press [...] "Repeat Rate" [...] again.|$|R
5000|$|The mill {{was built}} by Bill Keys, a local rancher, miner and character, using {{equipment}} moved from Pinon Wells. In the 1940s, Keys {{was involved in a}} dispute with Worth Bagley over access to the Wall Street Mill. Keys shot and killed Bagley in 1943 and placed a stone commemorating the event with the inscription: [...] "Here is where Worth Bagley bit the dust at the hand of W. <b>F.</b> <b>Keys,</b> May 11, 1943." [...] The marker is {{not a part of the}} Wall Street Mill historic district.|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} the alto {{saxophone}} is from concert D3 (the D below F—see Scientific pitch notation) to concert A5 (or A5 on altos with a high <b>F</b> <b>key).</b> As with most types of saxophones, the standard written range is B3 to F6 (or F6). Above that, the altissimo register begins at F6 (or G6) and extends upwards. The saxophone's altissimo register {{is more difficult to}} control than that of other woodwinds and is usually only expected from advanced players. By covering or partially covering the bell of the saxophone when playing B3, it is possible for the alto saxophone to reach A3 as well.|$|E
5000|$|The tenor {{saxophone}} is {{a medium-sized}} {{member of the}} saxophone family, a group of instruments invented by Adolphe Sax in the 1840s. The tenor and the alto {{are the two most}} commonly used saxophones. The tenor is pitched in the key of B (while the Alto is pitched in E), and written as a transposing instrument in the treble clef, sounding an octave and a major second lower than the written pitch. Modern tenor saxophones which have a high <b>F</b> <b>key</b> have a range from A2 to E5 (concert) and are therefore pitched one octave below the soprano saxophone. People who play the tenor saxophone are known as [...] "tenor saxophonists" [...] or [...] "tenor sax players".|$|E
50|$|Baritone saxophones come in {{two sizes}} with one ranging to low A {{and the other to}} low B. Originally, all {{baritone}} saxophones were low B instruments, but over time players began modifying their horns to reach the low A below. In the 1980s, it became common for saxophone manufacturers to produce low A instruments. In modern times, the low A is considered standard and is often written in sheet music for the instrument. Despite the ubiquity of the low A horn, some players still prefer to use B horns because of the added weight and supposedly poorer tone quality of low A horns. As is true for other saxophones, the high <b>F</b> <b>key</b> was also a later addition to the horn now considered standard.|$|E
50|$|G major (or {{the key of}} G) is a major scale {{based on}} G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and <b>F.</b> Its <b>key</b> {{signature}} has one sharp, F.|$|R
50|$|The AnyKey {{keyboard}} {{is easily}} distinguished from other generic keyboards by an extra double column of <b>F</b> <b>keys</b> {{on the left}} side, a unique eight directional arrow key pad {{as opposed to the}} traditional inverted T, and a quartet of extra keys directly above the numeric pad that control the programmable aspects of the keyboard. They are labeled “Program Macro”, “Suspend Macro”, “Repeat Rate”, and “Remap”, reading left to right. All versions of the AnyKey are white or very light gray with some keys (notably the programming keys, extra function keys, and arrows) in a darker gray.|$|R
