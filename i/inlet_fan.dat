50|$|Fans can be {{installed}} parallel to each other, in series, {{or a combination of}} both. Parallel installation would be fans mounted side by side. Series installation would be a second fan in line with another fan such as an <b>inlet</b> <b>fan</b> and an exhaust fan. To simplify the discussion, it is assumed the fans are the same model.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{displayed}} with a 1.9m (75 in)-diameter <b>inlet</b> <b>fan</b> composed of 18 blades {{made from a}} titanium alloy. The fan diameter provides a bypass ratio of 8.5:1, which is significantly larger compared with previous Russian engines, but still slightly below the 10:1 bypass ratio achieved by the CFM LEAP-1A or the 12:1 ratio of Pratt & Whitney's PW1400G. The latter is the baseline engine selected by Irkut to power the MC-21 at service entry in 2017, but the PD-14 is being pursued as an indigenous option. Aviadvigatel acknowledges the PD-14 would also provide a new core that could be developed into an engine it calls the PD-18R, which would feature a fan-drive gear system similar to the PW1400G. Although the PD-14 display at MAKS revealed that Aviadvigatel has not yet adopted CFM's composite fan blade technology, the Russian manufacturer is catching up in other ways. The first-stage high-pressure turbine of the Russian engine was shown with 3D aerodynamic shaping and advanced interior cooling channels, which are hallmarks of all modern Western engine designs.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{steady-state}} and time-dependent <b>fan</b> <b>inlet</b> total temperature disturbances on {{the stability of}} a TF 30 -P- 3 turbofan engine were determined. Disturbances were induced by a gaseous-hydrogen-fueled burner system installed upstream of the <b>fan</b> <b>inlet.</b> Data were obtained at a <b>fan</b> <b>inlet</b> Reynolds number index of 0. 50 and at a low-pressure-rotor corrected speed of 90 percent of military speed.

5000|$|At this point, the {{temperature}} of the compressed cooled air is somewhat greater than the ambient temperature of the outside air. The compressed, cooled air then travels through the expansion turbine which extracts work from the air as it expands, cooling it to below ambient temperature (down to −20 °C or −30 °C). It is possible for the ACM to produce air cooled to less than 0 °C even when outside air temperature is high (as might be experienced with the aircraft stationary on the ground in a hot climate). [...] The work extracted by the expansion turbine is transmitted by a shaft to spin the pack's centrifugal compressor and an <b>inlet</b> <b>fan</b> which draws in the external air for the heat exchangers during ground running; ram air is used in flight. The power for the air conditioning pack comes from the reduction of the pressure of the incoming bleed air relative to that of the cooled air exiting the system; typical differentials are from about [...] to about [...]|$|E
5000|$|The Hyperloop concept {{operates}} {{by sending}} specially designed [...] "capsules" [...] or [...] "pods" [...] through a steel tube maintained at a partial vacuum. In Musk's original concept, each capsule floats on a 0.5-1.3 mm layer of air provided {{under pressure to}} air-caster [...] "skis", similar to how pucks are suspended in an air hockey table, while still allowing for speeds that wheels cannot sustain. Hyperloop One's technology uses passive maglev for the same purpose. Linear induction motors located along the tube would accelerate and decelerate the capsule to the appropriate speed for each section of the tube route. With rolling resistance eliminated and air resistance greatly reduced, the capsules can glide {{for the bulk of}} the journey. In Musk's original Hyperloop concept, an electrically driven <b>inlet</b> <b>fan</b> and air compressor would be placed at the nose of the capsule to [...] "actively transfer high-pressure air from the front {{to the rear of the}} vessel," [...] resolving the problem of air pressure building in front of the vehicle, slowing it down. A fraction of the air is shunted to the skis for additional pressure, augmenting that gain passively from lift due to their shape. Hyperloop One's system does away with the compressor.|$|E

40|$|Results {{are given}} of several {{analytical}} studies of nacelles suitable for advanced subsonic commercial transport aircraft. The {{impact on the}} nacelle of reduced aircraft noise and increased cruise Mach number is emphasized and initially developed {{in terms of the}} individual nacelle components: <b>inlet,</b> <b>fan</b> cowl, nozzle, etc. This is achieved by relating the noise and cruise speed constraints to which the aircraft system must be designed to specific limitations on the individual nacelle components. Performance assessments are then made (separately for each nacelle component) of competitive design concepts.

50|$|The {{scramjet}} {{is composed}} of three basic components: a converging inlet, where incoming air is compressed; a combustor, where gaseous fuel is burned with atmospheric oxygen to produce heat; and a diverging nozzle, where the heated air is accelerated to produce thrust. Unlike a typical jet engine, such as a turbojet or turbofan engine, a scramjet does not use rotating, fan-like components to compress the air; rather, the achievable speed of the aircraft moving through the atmosphere causes the air to compress within the inlet. As such, no moving parts are needed in a scramjet. In comparison, typical turbojet engines require <b>inlet</b> <b>fans,</b> multiple stages of rotating compressor fans, and multiple rotating turbine stages, all of which add weight, complexity, and {{a greater number of}} failure points to the engine.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{procedure was}} developed for design of acoustically treated nacelles for high bypass turbofan engines. The plan {{was applied to the}} conceptual design of a nacelle for the quiet engine typical of a 707 /DC- 8 airplane installation. The resultant design was modified to a test nacelle design for the NASA Lewis quiet fan. The acoustic design goal was a 10 db reduction in effective perceived fan noise levels during takoff and approach. Detailed nacelle designs were subsequently developed for both the quiet engine and the quiet fan. The acoustic design goal for each nacelle was 15 db reductions in perceived fan noise levels from the <b>inlet</b> and <b>fan</b> duct. Acoustically treated nacelles were fabricated for the quiet engine and quiet fan for testing. Performance of selected <b>inlet</b> and <b>fan</b> duct lining configurations was experimentally evaluated in a flow duct. Results of the tests show that the linings perform as designed...|$|R

Excessive heat can also damage an automobile's interior as well as personal property kept in the passenger compartment. So, a system to reduce this excessive heat by pumping out hot air and allowing cooler ambient air to enter the car by means of two micro fans was made. Also a cooling chamber was set up around the <b>inlet</b> <b>fan</b> to cool it a little further...|$|E
30|$|A thermographic camera, {{placed at}} a {{distance}} of 0.5  m, recorded the experiment. A relevant software allowed plotting average temperature of the monitoring areas of the two samples. Three wired thermocouples of type K were stapled to each sample. The sensors were pressed halfway in the wood and the LDPE foil to measure the surface temperature. Each sample was held by a weighting cell, which measured its mass change. The surface temperature and weight of each sample was recorded every 5  s. Room temperature and average RH were logged every minute by the climatic chamber sensors situated close to the <b>inlet</b> <b>fan.</b> Average air velocity and temperature, 10  mm below the monitored surfaces, were measured every 20  min by an air velocity meter placed halfway between sample and reference, see Fig.  1.|$|E
40|$|Flyover and static {{noise data}} from several engines are {{presented}} that show <b>inlet</b> <b>fan</b> noise measured in flight can {{be lower than}} that projected from static tests for some engines. The differences between flight and static measurements appear greatest when the fan fundamental tone due to rotor-stator interaction or to the rotor alone field is below cutoff. Data from engine and fan tests involving inlet treatment on the walls only are presented that show the attenuation from this treatment is substantially larger than expected from previous theories or flow duct experience. Data showing noise shielding effects due {{to the location of}} the engine on the airplane are also presented. These observations suggest that multiringed inlets may not be necessary to achieve the desired noise reduction in many applications...|$|E

5000|$|To start, a {{jet engine}} {{requires}} pneumatic {{rotation of the}} turbine, AC-electrical fuel pumps, and an AC-electrical [...] "flash" [...] that ignites the fuel. As the turbine (behind the combustion chamber) is already rotating, the front <b>inlet</b> <b>fans</b> are also rotating. After the ignition, both fans and turbine speed up their rotation. As combustion stabilizes, the engine thereafter only needs the fuel to run at idle. The started engine can now replace the APU when starting up further engines. During flight the APU and its generator are not needed.APUs are also used to run accessories while the engines are shut down. This allows the cabin to be comfortable while the passengers are boarding before the aircraft's engines are started. Electrical power is used to run systems for preflight checks. Some APUs are also connected to a hydraulic pump, allowing crews to operate hydraulic equipment (such as flight controls or flaps) prior to engine start. This function can also be used, on some aircraft, as a backup in flight in case of engine or hydraulic failure.|$|R

40|$|International audienceNoise {{reduction}} by active {{noise control}} in jet engines and its prediction is of high interest, since the acoustic goals of flightpath 2050 can hardly be achieved by passive acoustic treatments. Numerous former test campaigns showed that significant noise reduction is possible by {{active noise control}}. Simulations are needed for further understanding of test results {{and in order to}} predict the noise reduction and possibly impact on the performance of future jet engines. Therefore an ANC prediction tool in frequency domain based on a common 3 D CAA solver has been developed. The tool is validated by measurements in a simple straight duct with wall mounted sensors and loudspeakers. The primary sound field has one dominant azimuthal mode order. Varying complexity of the control concept leads to significant distinct results in noise reduction and the input signals of control sources. Later application of the tool will be the simulation of jet engines (i. e. <b>inlet,</b> <b>fan,</b> stator and nozzle). The CAA solver does not include the rotation of fan. Established models of fan scattering and sound transmission need to be implemented. The effect of the fan models on the noise control can be assumed by means of the investigated control concepts...|$|E
40|$|An {{acoustic}} radiation {{analysis was}} developed to predict the far-field characteristics of fan noise radiated from an acoustically lined unflanged duct. This analysis is comprised of three modular digital computer programs which together provide a capability of accounting for the impedance mismatch at the duct exit plane.

The detection of broadband modes {{generated by a}} laboratory-scaled <b>fan</b> <b>inlet</b> is performed using a near-field array of microphones arranged in a geodesic geometry. This array geometry is shown to allow a robust and accurate modal inversion. The sound power radiated from the <b>fan</b> <b>inlet</b> and the coherence function between different modal amplitudes are also presented. The knowledge of such modal content is useful in helping to characterize the source mechanisms of fan broadband noise generation, for determining the most appropriate mode distribution model for duct liner predictions, and for making sound power measurements of the radiated sound field...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experience}} using ANOPP {{to predict}} turbofan engine flyover noise {{suggests that it}} over-predicts overall EPNL by a significant amount. An improvement in this prediction method is desired for system optimization and assessment studies of advanced UHB engines. An assessment of the ANOPP fan <b>inlet,</b> <b>fan</b> exhaust, jet, combustor, and turbine noise prediction methods is made using static engine component noise data from the CF 6 - 8 OC 2, E(3), and QCSEE turbofan engines. It is shown that the ANOPP prediction results are generally higher than the measured GE data, and that the inlet noise prediction method (Heidmann method) {{is the most significant}} source of this overprediction. Fan noise spectral comparisons show that improvements to the fan tone, broadband, and combination tone noise models are required to yield results that more closely simulate the GE data. Suggested changes that yield improved fan noise predictions but preserve the Heidmann model structure are identified and described. These changes are based on the sets of engine data mentioned, as well as some CFM 56 engine data that was used to expand the combination tone noise database. It {{should be noted that the}} recommended changes are based on an analysis of engines that are limited to single stage fans with design tip relative Mach numbers greater than one...|$|E
40|$|An {{approximately}} 0. 25 {{scale model}} of the transition section of a tandem fan variable cycle engine nacelle was tested in the NASA Lewis Research Center 10 -by- 10 foot wind tunnel. Two 12 -inch, tip-turbine driven fans were used to simulate a tandem fan engine. Three testing modes simulated a V/STOL tandem fan airplane. Parallel mode has two separate propulsion streams for maximum low speed performance. A front <b>inlet,</b> <b>fan,</b> and downward vectorable nozzle forms one stream. An auxilliary top inlet provides air to the aft fan - supplying the core engine and aft vectorable nozzle. Front nozzle and top inlet closure, and removal of a blocker door separating the two streams configures the tandem fan for series mode operations as a typical aircraft propulsion system. Transition mode operation is formed by intermediate settings of the front nozzle, blocker door, and top inlet. Emphasis was on the total pressure recovery and flow distortion at the aft fan face. A range of fan flow rates were tested at tunnel airspeeds from 0 to 240 knots, and angles-of-attack from - 10 to 40 deg for all three modes. In addition to the model variables for the three modes, model variants of the top inlet were tested in the parallel mode only. These lip variables were: aft lip boundary layer bleed holes, and Three position turning vane. Also a bellmouth extension of the top inlet side lips was tested in parallel mode...|$|E
40|$|The NASA Refan Program {{included}} full-scale {{performance and}} noise ground tests {{of both a}} current production (JT 8 D- 15) and a refanned (JT 8 D- 115) engine. A description of the two ground tests including detailed propulsion, noise, and structural test results is presented. The primary objectives of the total test program were comparison of JT 8 D- 15 and JT 8 D- 115 overall propulsion system performance and noise characteristics and determination of incremental component noise levels. Other objectives of the test program included: (1) determination of acoustic treatment effectiveness; (2) measurement of internal sound pressure levels; (3) measurement of inlet and exhaust hardware performance; (4) determination of center-engine surge margin; and (5) evaluation of certain structural characteristics associated with the 727 refan center-engine inlet duct and JT 8 D refan engine exhaust system. The JT 8 D- 15 and - 115 tests were conducted during September 1974 and January to March 1975, respectively. Analyses of the test data indicated that the JT 8 D- 115, {{as compared to the}} JT 8 D- 15, demonstrates a 12. 5 percent to 13. 2 percent reduction in static specific fuel consumption, and a reduction of 6 to 7 PNdB in a weighted average value of static tone corrected perceived noise level. Separated into noise components, a significant reduction was shown for the <b>inlet</b> <b>fan,</b> aft fan, exhaust duct flow, turbine, and jet noises. However, core noise was increased.

40|$|The {{effect of}} forward speed on <b>fan</b> <b>inlet</b> {{turbulence}} was studied {{to determine the}} feasibility of using a wind tunnel to simulate various flight conditions where turbulence of atmospheric origin enters the engine inlet. The investigation was conducted in the Ames 7 - by 10 -foot Wind Tunnel with a small-scale low pressure-ratio fan. Results indicate that a wind tunnel of this size does produce large turbulence scale appropriate for simulation of atmospheric scale. But the tunnel's low turbulence intensity seems to cause results contrary to existing theories {{on the effects of}} <b>fan</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity ratio on turbulence scale. Limited results with artificially increased turbulence intensity removed this contradiction. Acoustic measurements showed the impact of inlet turbulence on fantone noise...|$|R
40|$|An approximately. 25 {{scale model}} of a Tandem Fan nacelle {{designed}} for a Type A V/STOL aircraft configuration was tested in a 10 -by- 10 foot wind tunnel. A 12 inch, tip driven, turbofan simulator was used to provide the suction source for the aft <b>fan</b> <b>inlet.</b> The front <b>fan</b> <b>inlet</b> was faired over for this test entry. Model variables consisted of a long aft inlet cowl, a short aft inlet cowl, a shaft simulator, blow-in door passages and diffuser vortex generators. Inlet pressure recovery, distortion, inlet angle of attack separation limits were evaluated at tunnel velocities from 0 to 240 knots, angles of attack from - 10 to 40 degrees and inlet flow rates representative of throat Mach numbers of 0. 1 to 0. 6. High inlet performance and stable operation was verified at all design forward speed and angle of attack conditions. The short aft inlet configuration provided exceptionally high pressure recovery except at the highest combination of angle of attack and forward speed. The flow quality at the fan face was somewhat degraded {{by the addition of}} blow-in door passages to the long aft inlet configuration due to the pressure disturbances generated by the flow entering the diffuser through the auxiliary air passages...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>fan</b> <b>inlet</b> {{temperature}} transients {{on the performance}} and stability of a turbofan engine were determined. The experiment was conducted at 90 and 74 percent of low-pressure-rotor military speed (9525 rpm) and with <b>fan</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature distortions having circumferential extents of 90 deg, 180 deg, 270 deg, and 360 deg. Temperature transients were controlled by varying the magnitude and rate of change of the inlet temperature rise. The engine response ranged from a momentary compressor pressure disturbance to low-pressure-compressor stall. The compressor distortion limits decreased with decreasing low-pressure-rotor speed and increased with increasing circumferential extent of distortion. Analysis of the data suggests strongly that the distortion limits of the compressor are a function of a critical magnitude of inlet temperature rise and are independent of the temperature rise rate...|$|R
