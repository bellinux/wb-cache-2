The philosopher wanted to save the individual from [...] "the tyranny of the general", to give to the individual an [...] "ontological dignity". He was deeply disturbed by the image of the individual as a simple instance of something general, as a simple particular case of a general rule. But he also intended to maintain the reality of the general natures, not wanting to reduce them to mere collections or classes of individuals. Thus, he rejected both Platonic realism, and nominalism of all kinds. Instead of choosing between nominalism and realism, he proposes a third version, which insists on the solidarity existent between the individual and the general, linked by their determinations. His triangle I-D-G forms thus an <b>irreducible</b> <b>unity,</b> reminiscent <b>of</b> Peirce's triad.|$|R

Deotyma). This paper begins with biographical information about Deotyma’s family life, upbringing {{and its influence}} on her future career; reception of her charismatic personality and writing; and finally about her attitude to the employment of fantasy motives in literature. The main aim {{of this article is}} to investigate different types of miraculous events that take place in Branki w jasyrze. Those phenomena derive from various cultural and artistic frameworks: medieval hagiography, traditional folk fairy tale and primitive beliefs connected with Mongolian shamanism. In fact, this diversity has its purpose: Łuszczewska gathered all kinds of wonders to reveal the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> people’s transcendental <b>apprehensions.</b> Publikacja dofinansowana przez Wydział Filologiczny Uniwersytetu Łódzkieg...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the Clifford superalgebra Cl(n|m) {{generated}} by m pairs of Bose operators (odd elements) anticommuting with n pairs of Fermi operators (even elements) can be deformed to Cl_q(n|m) such that {{the latter is a}} homomorphic image of the quantum superalgebra U_q[osp(2 n+ 1 | 2 m) ]. The Fock space F(n|m) of Cl_q(n|m) is constructed. At q being a root <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> (q= (iπ l/k)) q-bosons (and q-fermions) are operators acting in a finite-dimensional subspace F_l/k(n|m) of F(n|m). Each F_l/k(n|m) is turned through the above mentioned homomorphism into an <b>irreducible</b> (root <b>of</b> <b>unity)</b> U_q[osp(2 n+ 1 | 2 m) ] module. For q being a primitive root <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> (l= 1) the corresponding representation is unitary. The module F_ 1 /k(n|m) is decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible U_q[sl(m|n) ] submodules. The matrix elements of all Cartan-Weyl elements of U_q[sl(m|n) ] are given within each such submodule.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis empirically tests Becker's {{assumption of}} offenders' {{knowledge of the}} probability <b>of</b> their <b>apprehension.</b> This assumption is tested by standardised interview with an unrepresentative sample of thirty hemp growers in the Czech Republic. Growers' subjective estimations of the probability <b>of</b> their <b>apprehension</b> are compared with approximation of the real probability <b>of</b> <b>apprehension.</b> The conclusion <b>of</b> the analysis is that the growers do correctly estimate the probability <b>of</b> <b>apprehension.</b> So Becker's assumption is (at the risk) confirmed. The hypotheses that high-cost growers estimate the probability better than low-cost growers and that growers with less than five plants estimate the probability <b>of</b> <b>apprehension</b> worse than growers with more than five plants were not confirmed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} law {{enforcement}} model to include court congestion. Society suffers harm from court congestion since delay affects the credibility and {{the reliability of the}} criminal justice system. The core result of the paper is that the probability <b>of</b> <b>apprehension</b> and the probability of conviction should be considered separately by the enforcement authority. Because the level of congestion is affected by the probability <b>of</b> <b>apprehension</b> only, the use of fines and conviction should be exhausted before resorting to the costlier (in terms of court congestion costs) instrument <b>of</b> <b>apprehension.</b> ...|$|R
