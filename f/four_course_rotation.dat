50|$|James Whetter has {{detected}} {{a shift from}} wheat to barley growing {{in the first half}} of the 17th century. By 1680-1700 there were probably 7 acres of barley to each 6 acres of wheat. This situation seems to have continued in the period 1700-1750 though barley growing may have increased in western districts. Oats was less important than wheat by 1750 and the small acreage of peas and beans appears to have declined. Crop rotations in Devon and Cornwall were simple and traditional. In 1667 Colepresse reported that in both counties a six-course rotation was used; in Cornwall two crops of wheat were followed by three of barley and one of oats or peas. There is other evidence to suggest that in parts of Cornwall a less arduous three or <b>four</b> <b>course</b> <b>rotation</b> was used, as at St Tudy and Lezant in the 1680s. Colepresse in the 1660s reported yields of wheat of 10-20 bushels per acre in Cornwall; and yields both of barley and oats of 10-15 bushels an acre in Cornwall (the yields for Devon were slightly higher). In years of a good harvest Cornish farmers were able to export grain along the coast. When the harvest failed as in 1727 and 1728 it was necessary for Cornwall to import grain. The cultivation of potatoes was much more common {{in the first half of}} the 18th century in Cornwall than it was in Devon at the same period. Hemp was grown in Cornwall in fishing districts to supply the fishermen. The production of flax in Cornwall declined in the half century before 1700. The effects of climate, soils and topography resulted in livestock-rearing being of greater agricultural importance than crops in the south-western counties as a whole and in Cornwall in particular. Cattle breding was important in the interior of Cornwall and in north Devon. Much of the stock sold in the markets of east Cornwall was sold to graziers for fattening further east. In the 1710s the farmers of St Germans summered their bullocks on the common moors of St Cleer and St Neot. The growing of turnips provided winter fodder for sheep and led to an increase in flocks of sheep between 1700 and 1750. There was also greater importance of mutton rather than wool in the 2nd quarter of the 18th century. Though less than in Devon cider production was a significant proportion of farm output in some districts such as the south east and the number of orchards increased in the latter half of the 17th century. Cornwall had a larger acreage of hops than any other southwestern county. Hops were grown mainly in the south east of the county and particularly in the parishes of Goran, Mevagissey and St Michael Caerhays. In the 1720s the hop acreage in Cornwall was c. 140 acres.|$|E
40|$|South Cambridgeshire {{has some}} of the richest arable land in England and has been {{cultivated}} by man for millennia. The nucleated villages of this region lying within their open fields were originally designed to use the land to its maximum, but {{by the turn of the}} nineteenth century the inflationary effects of bad harvests, wars. industrialisation and population growth had resulted in an enormous, increase in the demand for food. The introduction of new crops and new methods of cultivation, mainly the Norfolk <b>four</b> <b>course</b> <b>rotation,</b> resulted in the more enlightened landowners demanding enclosure. But this desire to plough every available piece of land ignored the destruction of the valuable and distinctive habitats that existed, particularly in the heaths and moors of the area.

40|$|Increased {{nitrogen}} use efficiency, NUE, in crop {{plant production}} {{is the main}} challenge for agriculture in this century. Any success in this objective achievement requires {{to take into account}} not only phosphorus and potassium but also secondary nutrients, such as magnesium and sulfur, at least. In order to check this hypothesis a series of annual field experiments were conducted in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2006, testing in the <b>four</b> <b>course</b> <b>rotation</b> response of following crops: maize ? spring barley ? winter oil-seed rape ? winter wheat to increasing level of nitrogen nutritional balance imposed by set of treatments comprised potassium and magnesium. The obtained results clearly indicated on maize as the most productive crop, irrespective of the imposed fertilizing system. The highest yields of the tested crops were harvested on plots fertilized with NPK and Kieserite, provide that potassium was applied as Korn-Kali. Effects of the imposed systems of fertilizer N balancing have been assessed by means of two NUE indices, such as: (i) partial factor productivity of fertilizer nitrogen (PFPN) and agronomic net efficiency of fertilizer nitrogen (AEN). Both indices were useful in making a reliable evaluation of tested treatments, but the AEN was more conspicuous as a NUE index. The most pronounced effect of the applied nutrients on yield development was through improvement of kernel/grain number per plant. This fact indirectly stresses on the importance of the period extending from the stage of ear growth to the stage of kernel/grain growth as decisive for final grain yield establishment. The net balance of plant available potassium and phosphorus showed that their net surplus with respect to yield response was negative, in turn indicating on magnesium as a nutrient required to reach nutritional balance of N, P, K in high-yielding crops...|$|E

40|$|Risk is an {{important}} factor in crop rotation systems and cropping system management studies. The study uses stochastic simulation techniques and Stochastic Efficiency with Respect to Function (SERF) to evaluate five crop rotations risk-efficiency and economic sustainability in Sudan Gezira Scheme. Price and yield risk for five crops were simulated to calculate whole-scheme net return. The analysis shows with the present irrigation system capacity 4 <b>course</b> <b>rotation</b> is the most preferred at lower (ARAC) and the 5 <b>Course</b> <b>rotation</b> (B) with 53 % land use intensity achieve water distribution equity and is the most risk efficient crop rotation at upper (ARAC). It is downside risk oriented and resilience crop rotation. The area allocated in 5 <b>Course</b> <b>rotations</b> (B) for cotton crop is 17 %, wheat 7 %, sorghum 60 %, groundnut 4 % and fodder crops 12 %. Fodder can be grown two times in summer and winter season without creating water shortage problems. However, this will increase net return and increase soil fertilities within the selected crop rotation. The result also shows that return pack to night storage irrigation system needs a risk premium of 36 Million (SDG). The techniques used in this study could be used with any distribution estimates for the uncertain variables to incorporate new crop varieties and research recommendation packages. They also could be modified to account for new information contribution during the decision process and account for dynamic effects and policy adjustment and modification...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 610 {{patients}} with small cell lung cancer {{were entered into}} a randomised trial designed to assess the effect of duration of initial chemotherapy on survival. Patients were randomised to receive either <b>four</b> or eight <b>courses</b> of cytotoxic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and etoposide and also randomised to receive, on disease progression, either second line chemotherapy (methotrexate and doxorubicin) or symptomatic treatment only.
