Using a seamless <b>jacquard</b> <b>knitting</b> machine, {{it is possible to}} integrate these sensors and electrodes directly into the fabrics, which can then be used in clothing for monitoring of elderly people, in sports or in hazardous occupations. The total integration of the sensing elements and connections into the garment presents great advantages in physical as well as psychological comfort of the user. It has been shown that the measurements are of adequate quality for most of the applications. In some cases, as is the case of ECG and EMG, signals acquired are similar to those obtained using conventional electrodes. Keywords—e-textile; biosignal monitoring; ECG; EMG; I...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims {{with the}} {{mathematical}} modelling {{of an active}} inflatable device. This device is composed of a compressor, an Electro-pneumatic Pressure Converter (EPC) and an Inflatable Textile fabric Pocket (ITP). The later has interesting mechanical properties and is fabricated using <b>Jacquard</b> <b>knitting</b> technique which allows automatic production of unlimited varieties of pattern weaving without any mould. Thanks to these features, these ITPs have provided a better alternative to the classical airbags made by stretchable polymer material. The proposed mathematical model is obtained by combining sub-models of two main parts of the whole system. In this way, a generalised and flexible model is obtained which can easily {{take into consideration the}} ITPs of different shapes. The pressure dynamics inside the ITP are considered by taking into account the air flow rate, variation of the volume of ITP and the length of pneumatic lines joining ITP with compressed air source. The parameters of the whole mathematical model are obtained via identification techniques. The effectiveness of the model is assessed through several experimental tests {{with the help of a}} servo hydraulic fatigue testing machine...|$|R

The wrapping numbers was set at 8. 0 turns/cm for the produced metal composite yarns. Furthermore, {{a type of}} plated knitted fabric was designed and produced by using the automatic <b>jacquard</b> <b>knitting</b> machine. The plated knitted fabric presents the BC-PET/AN/SSW metal composite yarn on the knitted fabric face and the crisscross-section polyester (CSP) on the knit back. The effect of lamination numbers and angles on the electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (EMSE) were discussed in this study. EMSE measurement showed that the lamination angles will influence the EMSE, but not affect the air permeability. Finally, a novel EM shielding socks was designed with the produced plated knitted fabric. Finally, the performance of thermal resistance and evaporation resistance was also test usingThe sweating guarded hot plate apparatus...|$|R

40|$|The {{representation}} weft {{knitted fabrics}} covers {{a wide range}} of methods, which may vary from country to country or may be similar, being used identical or slightly modified. In Romania, currently, for the weft knitted fabrics are used four methods of representing the knitted structures, namely: structural or analytical representation, representation using knitting notations, symbolic representation of the section of stitch courses and representation of drawing design. Generalization of knitted fabrics design using CAD systems determined the development of software design, including 2 D representation {{that can be used for}} any type of machine. 2 D representation of stitches solves the modeling problems and is possible to be executed using different computer graphics programs (CorelDRAW, AUTOCAD, etc). With the help of the graphic editor CORELDRAW it is possible to make the graphical representation of the structure of any kind of weft knitted fabric regardless of its complexity, strating from the simplest ones such as knits with basic weaves (single jersey, rib fabric, links, links and links patterns) to the most complex structures such as knitted fabrics with different evolutionary changes of normal stitches (tuck loop knits, missed stitches knits, racked stitches knits, etc.) or those with combined designs (<b>knitted</b> <b>jacquard,</b> intarsia <b>knits</b> etc.). This paper presents the possibility of using the CorelDRAW application for representing knitted structures...|$|R

However, many patterns might not have enough attractiveness and beauty and opting patterns among a wide domain of customers’ taste can be a large challenge. To resolve such a challenge an optimization and designing a scheme founded on artificial intelligence can be applied. In this method a designing system based on customer’s preference and market demand is devised which progressively connects with users and gather feedbacks and perform acceptable results to users.|$|R

To {{improve the}} {{accuracy}} {{and efficiency of}} fabric design CAD, a wavelet-domain Markov model to image texture segmentation from a natural framework for intergrating both local and global information of jacquard fabric image behavior, together with contextual information. Firstly the Daubechies wavelet and tree-structure is selected, then the approach decomposes the low frequency part of the jacquard fabric image. Secondly within the theoretical framework of Markov random field, we construct the grey field distribution model and label field prior model with finite Gaussian mixture algorithm and multi-level logistic algorithm respectively. The experiments for almost 30 warp <b>knitting</b> <b>jacquard</b> fabric images show that this approach is a feasible way for jacquard fabric, and it supplies a theoretical platform for subsequent research...|$|R

It is difficult to appraise all of responses if there are many answers. Algorithm genetic can contain a large vast of responses and find {{the best of them}} by receiving feedbacks from problems. Several designs with different colors can be done in weft <b>knitted</b> <b>Jacquard</b> designing system. However, many patterns might not have enough attractiveness and beauty. The choice of interesting and stylish patterns of the huge set of designs according to customer judgment is difficult. An interactive {{genetic algorithm}} that received necessary feedbacks from the user, can be used in design optimization and choosing ideal patterns. In this paper a software has been constructed to optimize jacquard pattern in weft knitted fabrics based on interactive genetic algorithm.|$|R
