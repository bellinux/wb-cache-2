Some studies have <b>even</b> <b>related</b> <b>it</b> to chromosome 21 because of its high correlation with patients with Down’s syndrome and familial Alzheimer’s disease. This theory is controversial, since patients with Turner’s syndrome also present a high prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis (up to fifty percent).|$|R

You know, I used to be very proud of myself when I'd see, you know, this little truck or lorry sort of trundle by in an episode of Thunderbirds and in my playbox I had exactly the same sort of Matchbox toy. And that sort of was the beginning, really, when I think about it, of, like, the connection of 'This isn't real, these are models, you know, they're making all this stuff up'." [...] The series has also influenced the work of author Warren Ellis (for example, in the premise of his 2002 comic series Global Frequency).|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to such views, other scientists argue that the wide spread transcription and splicing that is observed in the human genome directly by biochemical testing is a more accurate indicator of genetic function than genomic conservation because conservation estimates are relative due to incredible variations in genome sizes of <b>even</b> closely <b>related</b> species, <b>it</b> is partially tautological, and these estimates are not based on direct testing for functionality on the genome. Conservation estimates {{may be used to}} provide clues to identify possible functional elements in the genome, but it does not limit or cap the total amount of functional elements that could possibly exist in the genome since elements that do things at the molecular level can be missed by comparative genomics. Furthermore, much of the apparent junk DNA is involved in epigenetic regulation and appears to be necessary for the development of complex organisms.|$|R
40|$|Transcription of ribosomal RNA genes by RNA {{polymerase}} I {{is generally}} accepted as being highly species specific, a conclusion based on numerous reports that rRNA genes of one species are not transcribed by factors of <b>even</b> closely <b>related</b> species. <b>It</b> thus was striking {{to find that}} cloned rDNA from the frog Xenopus laevis is specifically transcribed in extracts prepared from mouse cells. The data in this paper demonstrate that this heterologous transcription {{is due to a}} normal initiation process and not to a fortuitous event. Transcription of Xenopus rDNA in the mouse cell extract is directed by the same large promoter (residue- 141 to + 6) that is utilized to promote the synthesis of frog rRNA in homologous Xenopus systems. Moreover, the same factors of the mouse cell extract that transcribe the homologous mouse rDNA also catalyze transcription from the X. laevis rDNA promoter. We conclude that polymerase I transcriptional machinery does not evolve as rapidly as prior studies would suggest...|$|R
40|$|M. A. (Information Science) Management {{is usually}} {{concerned}} with the motivation and job satisfaction of employees. When workers are adequately motivated and they derive sufficient satisfaction in their job, {{it is assumed that}} their productivity is likely to be enhanced. However, <b>even</b> without <b>relating</b> <b>it</b> to productivity, workers' job satisfaction is considered important enough to deserve serious attention from managers and researchers in various disciplines. This study intends to examine the motivation and job satisfaction of information specialists in public libraries in South Africa. The study of motivation is a candid search for answers to perplexing questions that revolve around human nature. There is no doubting the fact that the problem of motivating other people is surely as old as human history. The common adage that "one can lead a horse to water but cannot force it to drink" was, and remains, {{the most important aspect of}} the motivation problem. Because human behaviour is complex, there are numerous theories of motivation. Eight of the most well known theories are discussed: Maslow, Herzberg, MacGregor, McClelland, Atkinson, Hackman and Oldham, Vroom and Porter and Lawler. Attention is paid to the possible implications of the theories for library management. It seems though that, whatever theory of motivation one consults, some fertile sense and some constraining theory turns up. The focus should therefore rather be on the development and integration of existing theories to formulating new ones. A review of literature revealed that there is a relationship between motivation and job satisfaction. Thesurvey instrument was a forty-six-item questionnaire developed specifically for this study by the researcher. The first section of the questionnaire elicited background information, such as age, marital status, qualification, tenure, salary and benefits. The second section of the questionnaire gathered information about the participation and perceived participation of the responding information specialist in the library situation...|$|R

40|$|Identifying {{risk factors}} for the {{development}} of internalizing disorders is of major importance. In this context, behavioral inhibition (BIS), the fight-flight-freeze-system (FFFS), and attentional control (AC) have been proposed as being possible {{risk factors for}} both anxiety disorders and depression. <b>Even</b> though <b>related</b> cross-sectionally, <b>it</b> is still unclear whether these factors are precursors for internalizing disorders. In this longitudinal study, 1811 participants (aged 12 - 15) completed questionnaires on BIS/FFFS. AC, and internalizing symptoms at pretest and at two year follow-up. Supporting the alleged importance of BIS/FFFS and AC in the development of internalizing symptoms, BIS/FFFS and AC showed predictive value for anxiety and depression symptoms at two year follow-up. For anxiety symptoms this predictive value was not independent of the level of symptoms at pretest. For depression symptoms, AC showed predictive value over and above pretest level of depression symptoms. In the context of early detection of at risk adolescents, results suggest that screening of current anxiety and depression symptoms is most relevant in addition to a focus on AC for the screening of depression. However, it cannot be ruled out that at a further extended follow-up also BIS/FFFS might show independent predictive value for symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|In {{response}} {{to some of}} the criticisms, other scientists argued that the wide spread transcription and splicing that is observed in the human genome directly by biochemical testing is a more accurate indicator of genetic function than genomic conservation estimates because conservation estimates are all relative and difficult to align due to incredible variations in genome sizes of <b>even</b> closely <b>related</b> species, <b>it</b> is partially tautological, and these estimates are not based on direct testing for functionality on the genome. Conservation estimates may be used to provide clues to identify possible functional elements in the genome, but it does not limit or cap the total amount of functional elements that could possibly exist in the genome. Furthermore, much of the genome that is being disputed by critics seems to be involved in epigenetic regulation such as gene expression and appears to be necessary for the development of complex organisms. The ENCODE results were not necessarily unexpected since increases in attributions of functionality were foreshadowed by previous decades of research. Additionally, others have noted that the ENCODE project from the very beginning had a scope that was based on seeking biomedically relevant functional elements in the genome not evolutionary functional elements, which are not necessarily the same thing since evolutionary selection is neither sufficient nor necessary to establish a function. It is a very useful proxy to relevant functions, but an imperfect one and not the only one.|$|R
