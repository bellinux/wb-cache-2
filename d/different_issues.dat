The group {{consists}} of eighteen elected members and it advises and assists the pastor in important decisions concerning {{the affairs of}} the church.

The main purpose of the council is to give the pastor an insight into what the parish community thinks and how it feels about <b>different</b> <b>issues.</b> All of the parish activities must go through the four standing committees, which are the Liturgy, Education, Apostolic Work, and Temporalities.|$|E

Pennies were minted at London, Calais, York, and Durham.|$|E
30|$|Used {{the theory}} of {{behavioral}} finance and game theory, we build Initial public offering (IPO) pricing and underpricing models with investors’ heterogeneity based on <b>different</b> <b>issuing</b> mechanisms. We analysis how the heterogeneous expectations of investors influence IPO underpricing under <b>different</b> <b>issuing</b> mechanisms and a comparative analysis of the <b>different</b> <b>issuing</b> mechanisms is conducted.we find that IPO underpricing will not be eliminated by using either fixed-price or bookbuilding mechanisms, but when the investors’ heterogeneity expectation is the same, lower IPO underpricing {{can be obtained by}} the issuing of bookbuilding compared with that of fixed price. we also find  the IPO underpricing may be larger than that under fixed price if the heterogeneity of investors under bookbuilding is larger than that under fixed price. In addition, numerical analysis results provide strong support for our model and explain why high IPO underpricing under bookbuilding exists in China.|$|R

25|$|Demetrius II issued only {{silver and}} mostly tetradrachms, another trait {{which he has}} {{in common with the}} last Bactrian kings. The obverse shows a diademed portrait, with a {{standing}} Pallas Athene holding a spear on the reverse. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he has no epithet. Demetrius II is depicted as a young man, though his features differ considerably among the <b>different</b> <b>issues.</b> Several coins are struck off-center and crudely; this suggests that Demetrius II used a number of temporary mints.|$|E

25|$|The Negro World {{was founded}} on August 17, 1918, as a weekly {{newspaper}} to express {{the ideas of the}} organization. Garvey contributed a front-page editorial each week in which he developed the organization's position on <b>different</b> <b>issues</b> related to people of African ancestry around the world, in general, and the UNIA, in particular. Eventually claiming a circulation of 500,000, the newspaper was printed in several languages. It contained a page specifically for women readers, documented international events related to people of African ancestry, and was distributed throughout the African diaspora until publication ceased in 1933.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} {{event in the}} way of dialogue between religions has arguably been the 1986 Peace Prayer in Assisi to which Pope John Paul II, against considerable resistance also from within the Roman Catholic church, invited representatives of all world religions. This initiative was taken up by the Community of Sant'Egidio, who, with the support of John Paul II, organized yearly peace meetings of religious representatives. These meetings, consisting of round tables on <b>different</b> <b>issues</b> and of a common time of prayer has done much to further understanding and friendship between religious leaders and to further concrete peace initiatives. In order to avoid the reproaches of syncretism that were leveled at the 1986 Assisi meeting where the representatives of all religions held one common prayer, the follow-up meetings saw the representatives of the different religions pray in different places according to their respective traditions.|$|E
25|$|The first Washington-Franklin stamp issued was a two-cent red Washington-head, {{issued on}} November 16, 1908, {{to pay the}} first class postage on a {{standard}} letter. The seven separate and distinct Washington-Franklin series appeared at intervals of {{a year or two}} and included denominations that ranged from 1-cent to 1 or 5 dollars, depending on the series. The <b>different</b> <b>issues</b> can be distinguished from one another by one or more of several factors: perforation gauge, the type of stamp paper—or, in some unusual varieties, by the printing method used. Four or five basic paper-types were employed during the life of the issue. Two of these have different watermarks (consisting of single-line and double line letters: 'USPS'), while another paper-type had no watermarks (watermarks are detected by placing the stamp in a special fluid). In 1909 a much less common type of bluish paper was used, made of 35% rag stock combined with the usual wood pulp and can readily be identified by its faint bluish-gray color. (N. B., Some contend that bluish paper contained only 10% rag stock.) Later in the same year the Post Office is supposed to have experimented with China clay paper, but whether such a paper stock actually existed has become a matter of dispute.|$|E
