5|$|Due to Zog's {{concerns}} about safety during air raids, the ladies' cloakroom was {{converted into a}} private shelter for the Albanians. Following an air raid, when a bomb fell between the Ritz and the Berkeley in Piccadilly, shattering <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ritz, most of the Albanian royal family moved to Chelsea, but Zog remained until the spring of 1941 until he was offered Lord Parmoor's house in Buckinghamshire. In total, the Ritz was damaged nine times during bombing raids, and the Restaurant had to be closed twice.|$|E

5|$|Greenland ice cores show {{evidence}} of a large volcanic eruption in 1642±5BCE, which was suggested as being associated with Santorini. However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does not match the expected Santorini fingerprint.

5|$|Other {{potential}} {{or current}} uses of rubidium include a working fluid in vapor turbines, as a getter in vacuum tubes, {{and as a}} photocell component. Rubidium is also used as an ingredient in special types of <b>glass,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of superoxide by burning in oxygen, {{in the study of}} potassium ion channels in biology, and as the vapor in atomic magnetometers. In particular, 87Rb is used with other alkali metals in the development of spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers.|$|E

5|$|The south aisle was {{shortened}} {{in about}} 1870 by Scott, and given an apsidal east end, becoming the chapel of St Erasmus. The stained <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apse window is dated 1872 and is by Clayton and Bell. Below {{this is a}} mosaic designed by J.R.Clayton and made by Salviati, and a fresco painting by Clayton and Bell, dated 1874. Elsewhere the stained <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aisle is by Wailes, and by Hardman & Co. to a design by Pugin. The aisle contains the tomb of Ranulf Higdon, a monk at St Werburgh's Abbey in the 12thcentury who wrote a major work of history entitled Polychronicon, a monument to Thomas Brassey (a civil engineering contractor who died in 1870), designed by Blomfield and made by Wagmuller, a monument to Bishop Peploe who died in 1752, and three painted monuments {{by a member of}} the Randle Holme family.|$|E
5|$|The south transept, {{formerly}} the parish church of StOswald contains a piscina and sedilia {{in the south}} wall. On the east wall are four chapels, each with a reredos, two of which were designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, one by Kempe and the other by his successor, W.E.Tower. The south window is dated 1887 and was made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne to a design by R.C.Hussey. Other stained <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transept is by Clayton and Bell, by C.E.Kempe and by Powell.|$|E
5|$|The stained <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east window, dated 1856, {{was made}} by William Wailes. The glass in a south window in the chancel of 1909 {{was made by}} Morris & Co. The east window in the north aisle, dated 1920 is by Irene Dunlop. The stained glass window {{to the left of}} the pulpit was donated by the Greg family of Styal Mill. The stained <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> window at the west end of the north aisle is to the memory of the wife of Edward John Bell, rector from 1870 to 1907, and was made by Clayton and Bell in 1877. The tower holds a ring of six bells, hung for change ringing, five of which were cast in 1787 by Rudhall of Gloucester, and the sixth by Charles and George Mears at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1847. A seventh, unused, bell dates from 1686 and has been noted as being of {{historical}} importance by the Church Buildings Council of the Church of England. The parish registers begin in 1629, and the churchwardens' accounts in 1612.|$|E

5|$|Adolphus Aylward, the vicar from 1847 to 1872 and {{overseer}} of {{the parish}} restructuring, is commemorated by a brass plaque on the south-west pillar of the tower, and by a Clayton and Bell window in the north-west chancel. Aylward's daughter Julia had died in 1862 aged 15 and is buried in the churchyard; her grave was planted with snowdrops at her mother's request, which still bloom each spring. Julia Aylward is also commemorated by a piece of Burlison and Grylls <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lancet window at {{the west end of}} the north aisle.|$|E
5|$|After a 17-month trial, {{the often}} tumultuous {{proceedings}} {{ended with a}} guilty verdict on July 8, 1912. The defendants, including 27 leading Camorra bosses, were sentenced {{to a total of}} 354 years' imprisonment. The main defendants Enrico Alfano and Giovanni Rapi were sentenced to 30 years. The priest Vitozzi received seven years and government witness Abbatemaggio five years. The jury had been held in isolation since March 1911. The reports of the proceedings were about 40,000 pages in 63 volumes. In his last statement before the verdict, a furious Alfano accused the authorities to have killed his brother Ciro, who had died in prison. Another defendant, Gennaro De Marinas, who was sentenced to 30 years as well, slashed his throat with a piece of <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Court when the verdict was delivered.|$|E
5|$|After the curacy {{was placed}} under the {{patronage}} of Christ Church, the incumbents were mostly scholars or members of the college; from 1616 to 1640 the curacy was held by Robert Burton, author of The Anatomy of Melancholy, who enlarged the church. In the English Civil War the medieval stained <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church was destroyed, {{partly due to the}} vandalism of Parliamentarian troops captured at Cirencester in 1642 and imprisoned in the church. Following the Restoration the holders of the curacy changed rapidly, often remaining in the position for only a few years at a time. From at least 1713 Christ Church leased a house in High Street to parish trustees and the profits were used for repairing the church. This continued until 1923, when the house was sold.|$|E

5|$|Harvey Littleton (June 14, 1922 – December 13, 2013) was an American {{glass artist}} and educator. Born in Corning, New York, {{he grew up}} in the shadow of Corning Glass Works, where his father headed Research and Development during the 1930s. Expected by his father to enter the field of physics, Littleton instead chose a career in art, gaining {{recognition}} first as a ceramist and later as a glassblower and sculptor in <b>glass.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> latter capacity he was very influential, organizing the first glassblowing seminar aimed at the studio artist in 1962, {{on the grounds of the}} Toledo Museum of Art. Imbued with the prevailing view at the time that glassblowing could only be done on the factory floor, separated from the designer at his desk, Littleton aimed to put it within the reach of the individual studio artist.|$|E
5|$|Scott's {{alterations}} proved {{successful in}} stabilising {{the tower and}} in serving {{the needs of the}} church, and the church remained little changed for the next 130years; the most notable alterations during this period were the replacement of the <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chancel's two leper windows with stained glass images of Pre-Raphaelite knights by Edward Burne-Jones as a memorial to a young officer killed during the Boer War, and the painting of a mural over the chancel arch by John Ward depicting the events of Holy Week in modern dress and set in the Chilterns. In 1951 the church was Grade A listed.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is {{cast in the}} Classical Revival architectural style and contains elements common to that style. Stained glass, columns and a pediment are among the more noticeable features at a glance. The rear facade of the {{building is}} designed to resemble a temple and also features stained glass windows. A stone porte-cochere covers the rear driveway. Inside the building's third floor courtroom is more stained <b>glass,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a skylight. During the early 1980s a made for television movie had scenes filmed in the DeKalb County Courthouse's courtroom.|$|E
40|$|Thermal diffusivities (α) and molar volumes (V_m) of bulk Al_ 20 As_xTe_ 80 -x alloy <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{composition}} range 0 ≤ x ≤ 35 are examined.

Earlier temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetric measurements on these glasses have revealed the non-reversing heat flow to show a global minimum(reversibility window) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same {{composition range}}. Taken together {{these results suggest that}} present <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 15 <x< 25 range are self-organized.

5|$|The cloisters were {{restored}} in the 20thcentury, and {{the stained glass}} windows contain the images of some 130saints. The cloister garth contains a modern sculpture entitled The water of life by Stephen Broadbent. The refectory roof is dated 1939 and was designed by F.H.Crossley. The east window with reticulated tracery was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and is dated 1913. The stained <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west window, depicting the Creation, was designed by Ros Grimshaw and installed in 2001 to celebrate the Millennium. On the refectory's west wall there is a tapestry depicting Elymas being struck with blindness which was woven at Mortlake in the 17thcentury from a cartoon by Raphael. The heraldic paintings on the north wall represent {{the arms of the}} Earls of Chester.|$|E
5|$|The filming in {{downtown}} Chicago {{was conducted on}} Sundays {{during the summer of}} 1979, and much of the downtown was cordoned off from the public. Costs for filming the largest scene in the city's history totaled $3.5 million. Permission was given after Belushi and Aykroyd offered to donate $50,000 to charity after filming. Although the Bluesmobile was allowed to be driven through the Daley Center lobby, special breakaway panes were temporarily substituted for the normal <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building. The speeding car caused $7,650 in damage to 35 granite paver stones and a bronze air grill in the building. Interior shots of the elevator, staircase, and assessor's office were all recreated in a film set for filming.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{church of}} St. James is also {{located near the}} centre of Taunton quite close to St. Mary Magdalene. The oldest parts of St. James Church are early 14th-century, and there are {{fragments}} of 15th-century <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west end. Like St. Mary's {{it also has a}} sandstone tower but built to a much less impressive design. The tower was also, like St. Mary's, rebuilt in the 19th century– in this case thought to be due to building defects in the original tower. The church backs onto the County Ground and forms a familiar backdrop to the popular cricket ground.|$|E
