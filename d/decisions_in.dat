Knowledge of Ancient Greek was required for admission until 1920, and Latin until 1960.|$|E
5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as {{a rejection of the}} Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory <b>decisions.</b> <b>In</b> 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the case}} has not been {{formally}} overruled, two Supreme Court <b>decisions</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s and 1980s have undone its effect by ruling that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for a federal common law cause of action for recovering possession based on the common-law doctrine of aboriginal title. Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act is no longer good law. Modern federal courts hold that only Congress can ratify a conveyance of aboriginal title, and only with a clear statement, rather than implicitly.|$|E
