50|$|Directing {{his first}} {{dramatic}} feature, Fisher Stevens {{does his best}} to give these gravel-voiced legends room to strut their stuff. But that's the problem: The movie is {{too much of a}} wide-eyed, ramshackle homage to '70s-acting-class indulgence. It needed much more shape and snap. Still, when Alan Arkin joins the party as a dying colleague, his antics—at least once he <b>gets</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> of a stolen car—give the film a fuel injection. Stand Up Guys reminds you that these three are still way too good to collapse into shticky self-parody, even when they're in a movie that's practically begging them to.|$|R
