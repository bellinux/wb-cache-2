5|$|Codium <b>fragile</b> ssp. <b>fragile</b> (formerly {{reported}} as ssp. tomentosum), now well established.|$|E
5|$|Although Morchella populiphila is an edible species, {{it is not}} {{as highly}} valued as other morels because of its <b>fragile</b> nature and its {{inferior}} flavor.|$|E
5|$|Codium <b>fragile</b> ssp. atlanticum {{has been}} {{established}} to be native, although for many years it was regarded as an alien species.|$|E
5|$|German industry, {{rather than}} being <b>fragile</b> and fixed, proved to be {{resilient}} and mobile.|$|E
5|$|Lexie is {{paranoid}} and irritated that other's {{may view}} her as <b>fragile</b> and incompetent {{due to her}} melt down and works hard to repair her image.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} complex diplomacy between {{players and}} includes real-time lip-synced animations for in-game actors. Described {{as a combination}} of SimCity 2000, Civilization and Risk, <b>Fragile</b> Allegiance uses an icon based GUI for all menus and game commands. Unlike other RTS games, there is no defined tech tree, with technology being unlocked by the purchase of 36 blueprints {{at any time during}} the course of the game. <b>Fragile</b> Allegiance is the spiritual successor to K240 and there are many similarities between the two.|$|E
5|$|Although Owen was the {{conductor}} for {{the performances of}} Cavalliera Rusticana, and remained as musical director of the company until 1952, his health was <b>fragile</b> and he conducted none of the company's other productions. His colleague, the chorus master, Ivor John, {{was in charge of}} the first season's Pagliacci and Faust.|$|E
5|$|At the British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs) in 1997, Our Friends in the North won {{the award}} for Best Drama Serial, ahead of other nominees The Crow Road, The <b>Fragile</b> Heart and Gulliver's Travels. At the same ceremony, Gina McKee won the Best Actress category. Both Christopher Eccleston and Peter Vaughan (who played Nicky's father, Felix) were {{nominated}} for the Best Actor award for their performances in Our Friends in the North, but they lost to Nigel Hawthorne {{for his role in}} The <b>Fragile</b> Heart. Also at the 1997 BAFTAs, Peter Flannery was presented with the honorary Dennis Potter Award for his work on the serial. Our Friends in the North also gained BAFTA nominations for costume design, sound, and photography and lighting.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand's rule {{remained}} <b>fragile</b> in {{the eastern}} territories of the Kingdom of Hungary {{because he did not}} send enough mercenaries to defend them. Suspecting that Martinuzzi was conspiring with the Ottomans, Castaldo had Martinuzzi murdered in late 1551. The Ottomans occupied the lowlands of Banat in the summer of 1552.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fragile</b> Allegiance {{generally}} scored {{well with}} reviewers, with PC Gamer UK giving {{the game the}} Game of Distinction award and it was praised for its graphics, interface and sound. The game has problems running on Windows XP and later Windows versions, as it was designed for MS-DOS and ported to Windows 95.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland's {{ecosystems}} can {{be particularly}} <b>fragile,</b> because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing. The climatic, geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very <b>fragile</b> ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change. Nevertheless, according to the 2014 Environmental Performance Index, Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on environmental public health, its heavy reliance on {{renewable sources of energy}} (hydropower and geothermal energy), and its control of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} {{is a very}} {{difficult}} structure to study because it is so thin and <b>fragile.</b> In spite of these limitations dozens of techniques have been developed over the last seventy years to allow investigations of its structure and function.|$|E
5|$|The {{shells of}} Amphidromus are {{relatively}} large, {{from one to}} three inches high, and colorful. Amphidromus has an elongate-conic or ovate-conic helicoid shell of 5 to 8 whorls. The shell may be thin and <b>fragile,</b> or very heavy and solid, with no known correlation of shell structure with distribution or habitats.|$|E
5|$|An acute nosebleed may {{be managed}} {{with a variety}} of measures, such as packing of the nasal cavity with {{absorbent}} swabs or gels. Removal of the packs after the bleeding may lead to reopening of the <b>fragile</b> vessels, and therefore lubricated or atraumatic packing is recommended. Some patients may wish to learn packing themselves to deal with nosebleeds without having to resort to medical help.|$|E
5|$|As a {{resident}} of Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin {{was concerned about the}} impact of insensitive tourist development and deforestation on the European Alps. At the World Economic Forum in 1990, he launched Alp Action to protect the mountain ecosystem and preserve the Alps' cultural diversity and vitality. The Bellerive Foundation program encouraged eco-tourism, aiming to reduce the impact of outdoor adventure sports on the <b>fragile</b> alpine habitat. During its years of operation, Alp Action successfully launched over 140 projects in seven countries. It found inspiration in the system of national parks of the Canadian Rockies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, conservationists became {{alarmed by the}} damage overgrazing, logging, and {{unregulated}} visitation were having on the <b>fragile</b> features of Bryce Canyon. A movement to have the area protected was soon started, and National Park Service Director Stephen Mather responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon {{be made into a}} state park. The governor of Utah and the Utah State Legislature, however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President Warren G. Harding, who on June 8, 1923 declared Bryce Canyon a national monument.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Greeks of Laconia and Arcadia, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of a certain Michael, tried to stop the Franks at the olive grove of Kountouras in northeastern Messenia. Modern scholars have traditionally identified this Michael with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, founder of the Despotate of Epirus, but this identification has been questioned more recently by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, as the <b>fragile</b> nature of his control over Epirus would have made a departure to aid the Moreote Greeks a major and unlikely gamble.|$|E
5|$|Barron's <b>fragile</b> health necessitated his resignation; {{he passed}} command to John Rodgers in late May 1805. Barron ordered Cox to command Essex, and turned President {{over to his}} brother, James Barron, on 29May. On 3June, after the Battle of Derne, the U.S signed a peace treaty with Tripoli. President sailed for the United States on 13July, {{carrying}} the ailing Barron and many sailors released from captivity in Tripoli.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were <b>fragile,</b> and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis's {{popularity}} and high-profile {{have led to}} concerns in recent decades over the impact of humans on the <b>fragile</b> mountain environment. These concerns contributed {{to the creation of}} The , a five-year programme which aims to protect, enhance and future-proof Ben Nevis by delivering nineteen ambitious environmental projects between 2014 and 2019. The Nevis Landscape Partnership is supported by five partner organisations (John Muir Trust, Forestry Commission Scotland, The Highland Council, Scottish Natural Heritage & The Nevis Partnership) and has been made possible by Heritage Lottery Funding.|$|E
5|$|Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher), a {{clinical}} social worker, warns against questioning Patricia â€” {{although she is}} an important witness, she is only a child and is in a <b>fragile</b> mental state. Black and Bletcher visit James Glen (Glynn Turman) a graphology expert, having found the killer's signature in the viewing's guestbook. Analysis of the killer's handwriting links him to almost forty open house viewings over the previous six months.|$|E
5|$|Cagney made a rare TV {{appearance}} in the lead role of the movie Terrible Joe Moran in 1984. This was his last role. Cagney's health was <b>fragile</b> and more strokes had confined him to a wheelchair, but the producers worked his real-life mobility problem into the story. They also decided to dub his impaired speech, using the impersonator Rich Little. The film made use of fight clips from Cagney's boxing movie Winner Take All (1932), {{despite the fact that}} the TV movie is about an entirely different character.|$|E
5|$|Darjeeling {{has several}} British-style public schools, which attract pupils {{from all over}} India and a few {{neighbouring}} countries. The varied culture of the town reflects its diverse demographic milieu comprising indigenous Bengali, Nepali, Lepcha, Bhutia, Tibetan, and other mainland Indian ethno-linguistic groups. Darjeeling, alongside its neighbouring town of Kalimpong, was {{the centre of the}} Gorkhaland movement in the 1980s. The town's <b>fragile</b> ecology has been threatened by a rising demand for environmental resources, stemming from growing tourist traffic and poorly planned urbanisation.|$|E
5|$|Drilling {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has {{a relatively low}} density, and these shales may not be chemically compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is relatively <b>fragile,</b> and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the drilling fluid back up through the borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the drilling process.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the Dutch {{would attempt}} to re-establish their {{authority}} over Indonesia, the new Republican Government and its leaders moved quickly to strengthen the fledgling administration. Within Indonesia, the newly formed government, although enthusiastic, was <b>fragile</b> and focused in Java (where focused at all). It was rarely and loosely {{in contact with the}} outer islands, which had more Japanese troops (particularly in Japanese naval areas), less sympathetic Japanese commanders, and fewer Republican leaders and activists. In November 1945, a parliamentary form of government was established and Sjahrir was appointed Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|For a phylum with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores {{have a wide}} range of body plans. Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so <b>fragile</b> that {{it is very difficult to}} capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera â€“ Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fragile</b> Allegiance has {{a simplistic}} combat {{system with the}} player having no direct control over units when a fleet enters combat. Enemy asteroids can be {{attacked}} using ships, missiles and agents. During a battle, laser beams criss-cross the screen and buildings catch fire before being destroyed. Ground turrets fire back at attacking ships and anti-missile turrets shoot out incoming missiles.|$|E
5|$|Geysers are <b>fragile</b> {{phenomena}} and if conditions change, they may go dormant or extinct. Many {{have been destroyed}} simply by people throwing debris into them while others have ceased to erupt due to dewatering by geothermal power plants. However, the Great Geysir of Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially inducedâ€”often on special occasionsâ€”by the addition of surfactants to the water.|$|E
5|$|Haddam Island State Park {{is home to}} a {{large number}} of bird species, {{especially}} during annual migrations, which make it suitable for birdwatching. Bird-banding and other research activities have taken place on the island. Other recommended activities are boating and fishing. Access via boat is available from the Haddam Meadows State Park boat launch, a half mile south of Haddam Island. The northern side of the island has a beach that is <b>fragile</b> and cannot support heavy visitation, and the island has a significant amount of poison ivy.|$|E
5|$|I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is {{the eighth}} studio album by the American indie rock band Yo La Tengo, {{released}} on April 22, 1997, by Matador Records. It {{was produced by}} Roger Moutenot and recorded at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee. The album expands the guitar-based pop of its predecessor Electr-O-Pura to encompass {{a variety of other}} music genres, including bossa nova, krautrock, and electronic music. Most of the songs on the album deal with melancholy emotions and range from short and <b>fragile</b> ballads to long and open-ended dissonance.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Catalan {{parliament}} {{passed a}} resolution urging development of a government plan to improve the site. A government report in 2001, re-published in 2004, included a proposal to cut down the <b>fragile</b> Pi Vell, leaving the stump in place along with a commemorative monument, and purchase and develop the site as a public amenity.|$|E
5|$|In May 2006, the {{activities}} of the Bellerive Foundation were merged into the Geneva-based Aga Khan Foundation (founded in 1967 by Prince Sadruddin's nephew Karim Aga KhanIV) to form the Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan Fund for the Environment. The US$10 million fund is dedicated to finding practical solutions to environmental problems. The fund concentrates its activities in six areas that were important to Prince Sadruddin: environmental education; natural resource management in <b>fragile</b> zones; nature parks and wildlife reserves; environmentally and culturally appropriate tourism infrastructure; environmental health; and research.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, a {{combination}} of drought and regulatory decisions passed based on the Endangered Species Act of 1973 have forced Reclamation to turn off much of the water for {{the west side of}} the San Joaquin Valley in order to protect the <b>fragile</b> ecosystem in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and keep alive the dwindling fish populations of Central Valley rivers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Mellor won drawing prizes at the ANU's Canberra School of Art and the Grafton Regional Gallery in New South Wales. Through the mid-1990s, while {{studying}} in Canberra and Birmingham, he was represented in numerous student and other exhibitions, in Australia, Belgium, Japan, Korea and the United Kingdom. These included exhibitions titled Passage, at Kyoto Seika University in Japan in 1994, and <b>Fragile</b> Objects at the National Library of Australia in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} ODIs, Gilchrist scored only 97 runs at 16.16. The Australian {{selectors}} sought to accommodate Hayden, {{who had been}} successful as a Test opener, into the ODI team by rotating him with Gilchrist and Waugh, but this appeared to unsettle the team. With a newly <b>fragile</b> top-order, Australia failed {{to qualify for the}} finals, and the Waugh brothers were dropped from the team, ending Gilchrist's four-year partnership with Mark. Ricky Ponting was promoted to the captaincy ahead of vice captain Gilchrist.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{are mostly}} soft bodied, <b>fragile</b> and almost defenseless {{compared}} to other, larger lifeforms. The immature stages are small, move slowly or are immobile, {{and so all}} stages are exposed to predation and parasitism. Insects then {{have a variety of}} defense strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids. These include camouflage, mimicry, toxicity and active defense.|$|E
