40|$|The nuclear {{symmetry}} energy {{coefficients of}} finite nuclei are extracted {{by using the}} differences between the masses of isobaric nuclei. Based on the masses of more than 2400 nuclei with A= 9 - 270, we investigate the model dependence in the extraction of symmetry <b>energy</b> <b>coefficient.</b> We find that the extraction of the symmetry energy coefficients is strongly correlated with the forms of the Coulomb energy and the mass dependence of the symmetry <b>energy</b> <b>coefficient</b> adopted. The values of the extracted symmetry energy coefficients increase by about 2 MeV for heavy nuclei when the Coulomb correction term is involved. We obtain the bulk symmetry <b>energy</b> <b>coefficient</b> S_ 0 = 28. 26 ± 1. 3 MeV and the surface-to-volume ratio κ= 1. 26 ± 0. 25 MeV if assuming the mass dependence of symmetry <b>energy</b> <b>coefficient</b> a_ sym(A) =S_ 0 (1 -κ/A^ 1 / 3), and S_ 0 = 32. 80 ± 1. 7 MeV, κ= 2. 82 ± 0. 57 MeV when a_ sym(A) =S_ 0 (1 +κ/A^ 1 / 3) ^- 1 is adopted.

40|$|The {{ratio of}} {{symmetry}} <b>energy</b> <b>coefficient</b> to temperature $C_{sym}/T$ is extracted from different prescriptions using the isotopic {{as well as}} the isobaric yield distributions obtained in different projectile fragmentation reactions. It is found that the values extracted from our theoretical calculation agree with those extracted from the experimental data but they differ very much from the input value of the symmetry energy used. The best possible way to deduce the value of the symmetry <b>energy</b> <b>coefficient</b> is to use the fragment yield at the breakup stage of the reaction and it is better to use the grand canonical model for the fragmentation analysis. This is because the formulas that are used for the deduction of the symmetry <b>energy</b> <b>coefficient</b> are all derived in the framework of the grand canonical ensemble which is valid only at the break-up (equilibrium) condition. The yield of "cold" fragments either from the theoretical models or from experiments when used for extraction of the symmetry <b>energy</b> <b>coefficient</b> using these prescriptions might lead to the wrong conclusion.

40|$|Strongly {{magnetized}} symmetric nuclear {{matter is}} investigated {{within the context}} of effective baryon-meson exchange models. The magnetic field is coupled to the charge as well as the dipole moment of the baryons by including the appropriate terms in the Lagrangian density. The saturation density of magnetized, symmetric nuclear matter was calculated for magnetic fields of the order of 10 ^ 17 gauss. For the calculated range of saturation densities the binding energy, symmetry <b>energy</b> <b>coefficient</b> and compressibility of nuclear matter were also calculated. It is found that with an increasing magnetic field the saturation density increases, while the system becomes less bound.

Condition monitoring and fault diagnostics of these bearings are {{of great concern}} in industries as most rotating machine failures are often linked to bearing failures. This paper presents a methodology for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and wavelet packet transform (WPT). In order to obtain the useful information from raw data,db 02 and db 08 wavelets were adopted to decompose the vibration signal acquired from the bearing. Further Denoising technique based on wavelet analysis was applied. This de-noised signal was decomposed up to 7 th level by wavelet packet transform (WPT) and 128 wavelet packet node <b>energy</b> <b>coefficients</b> were obtained and analyzed using db 04 wavelet.
