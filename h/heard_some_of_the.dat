25|$|The Kopernik Observatory & Science Center has a {{permanent}} ham radio station using the club call sign: K2ZRO. The station is often open during public programs on Friday evenings. The call sign K2ZRO belonged to Kazimierz Deskur, {{one of the}} founding members of the Kopernik Society, who built the Kopernik Observatory. Kaz Deskur <b>heard</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first signals from Sputnik, and this led to his interest in amateur radio satellites (the facility has an original Sputnik QSL card). He was an early pioneer in amateur radio satellites and developed a device called the OSCARLocator, a great circle map-like device to aid hams in tracking them.|$|E

500|$|In July 1945, {{after the}} Red Cross {{confirmed}} {{the deaths of}} the Frank sisters, Miep Gies gave Otto Frank the diary and a bundle of loose notes that she had saved in the hope of returning them to Anne. Otto Frank later commented that he had not realized Anne had kept such an accurate and well-written record of their time in hiding. In his memoir, he described the painful process of reading the diary, recognizing the events described and recalling that he had already <b>heard</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more amusing episodes read aloud by his daughter. He saw {{for the first time the}} more private side of his daughter and those sections of the diary she had not discussed with anyone, noting, [...] "For me it was a revelation... I had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings... She had kept all these feelings to herself". Moved by her repeated wish to be an author, he began to consider having it published.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2010, Billboard {{published}} an article stating that Apple was planning on releasing a new album in spring 2011, with musician Michelle Branch claiming to have <b>heard</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new tracks. Drummer Charley Drayton also told Modern Drummer magazine that he was co-producing the record. However, the album was not released {{in the spring and}} Billboard reported later that Epic was not aware of a record. Apple delayed the album's release until 2012, explaining that she was waiting [...] "until her label found a new president and that she didn't want her work to be mishandled amid corporate disarray." [...] In January 2012, after its new record label head, LA Reid hinted at new music from Apple, Epic Records announced that the album would be released later in the year. Apple announced performances at the South by Southwest Festival and a spring 2012 tour soon after.|$|E
2500|$|Tinderbox {{would be}} later hailed by Jean-Benoît Dunckel of Air. He {{selected}} Tinderbox for his [...] "5 albums forever" [...] list, saying, [...] "They played so well together; I saw them in concert and I never forgot that moment". Billy Howerdel of A Perfect Circle rated {{it as his}} all-time favourite album [...] Howerdel described it as [...] "one of the spookiest records I've ever <b>heard.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs on there have such a dense atmosphere. Sometimes when I'm stuck, I'll listen to that. It's like sometimes when you have no inspiration and {{you go out and}} look at the moon, that's kind of what that record is for me". Jenny Lee Lindberg [...] of Warpaint cited the band among her influences, as well as the song [...] "Umbrella", initially included in the track listing of the 1986 CD version. She said: [...] "This is a song that my husband and I bonded over – we’d definitely heard it individually before, but one day we were just playing the album and that song stopped us in our tracks… played it on repeat for the whole night. I understand why some people can hear a little Siouxsie in what we do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lewis {{completed}} her first headline tour The Labyrinth in July 2010 {{and soon after}} began making plans for her then-untitled third album. Recording and production officially began in late 2010 {{with a view to}} releasing the album in November 2011. Originally [...] "Collide," [...] a collaboration with Swedish DJ Avicii, was released in August 2011, with the album to follow in November. However Lewis was inspired to continue making music and used her Facebook account to announce that the album was being pushed back into early 2012. 26 March 2012 was confirmed as the new release date for Glassheart. To bridge the gap between Echo (2009) and Glassheart, Lewis teamed with British producer Fraser T Smith to record , an extended play (EP) of cover songs which was released in December. In January 2012, Lewis announced that the album was being pushed back again, this time to November 2012. During an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis confirmed that she had recorded with Scottish DJ Calvin Harris and that Smith had been brought on board to help with production. In April 2012, in an interview at the Ariella Couture fashion show, Lewis stated, [...] "I'm now planning to have the album out in the summer [...] Simon Cowell has <b>heard</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tracks and he loves it". Cowell would later publicly offer his support, declaring to Lewis that although there's been a lengthy wait of two years for new music, [...] "I think this new album is sensational, you've never sounded better." ...|$|E
