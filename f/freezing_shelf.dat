40|$|The {{cellular}} structure of collagen-glycosaminoglycan (CG) scaffolds used in tissue engineering must {{be designed to}} meet a number of constraints with respect to biocompatibility, degradability, pore size, pore structure, and specific surface area. The conventional freeze-drying process for fabricating CG scaffolds creates variable cooling rates throughout the scaffold during freezing, producing a heterogeneous matrix pore structure with a large variation in average pore diameter at different locations throughout the scaffold. In this study, the scaffold synthesis process was modified to produce more homogeneous freezing by controlling of the rate of freezing during fabrication and obtaining more uniform contact between the pan containing the CG suspension and the <b>freezing</b> <b>shelf</b> {{through the use of}} smaller, less warped pans. The modified fabrication technique has allowed production of CG scaffolds with a more homogeneous structure characterized by less variation in mean pore size throughout the scaffold (mean: 95. 9 microm, CV: 0. 128) compared to the original scaffold (mean: 132. 4 microm, CV: 0. 185). The pores produced using the new technique appear to be more equiaxed, compared with those in scaffolds produced using the original technique...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Temperature, salinity, oxygen, and {{chlorofluorocarbon}} (CFC) {{data obtained}} in September 1997 define the water types ventilating the deep {{eastern and central}} basins of the Bransfield Strait. These water types are observed adjacent to Joinville Island and are clearly derived from the Weddell Sea. The eastern basin bottom water characteristics closely match that of the bottom water at 310 dbar depth- 50 km east of Joinville Island. The eastern basin bottom water is a simple mixture of low-salinity <b>freezing</b> point <b>shelf</b> water (65 %) and relatively warm saline Weddell Deep Water (35 %), with a CFC- 113 : CFC- 11 ratio age of 8. 5 years. The eastern basin bottom water shares a common origin with a weak salinity minimum observed at 1000 dbar within the central basin, though overflow from the central basin to the eastern basin floor may also occur. The bottom water within the central basin is colder and saltier with higher concentrations of oxygen and CFC- 11 {{than that of the}} eastern basin. The central basin bottom water with a CFC ratio age of 7. 5 years is composed of same Weddell water types that form the eastern basin bottom water plus a large contribution of high-salinity <b>freezing</b> point <b>shelf</b> water of the characteristics of water observed 10 km northeast of Joinville Island and a small amount of Pacific pycnocline water. The components (and their percentage) are Weddell Deep Water (11 %), low-salinity shelf (24 %), high-salinity shelf (60 %), to Pacific pycnocline (5 %) ...|$|R
30|$|Distinguishing hyperpycnites from bottom-current {{deposits}} {{that are}} ubiquitous in the world’s oceans is a challenge. In particular, contourites are of importance (Hollister 1967; Rebesco and Camerlenghi 2008). The generation of thermohaline-induced density flows {{is similar to}} that of hyperpycnal flows. For example, the deep-water masses in the world’s oceans are caused by differences in temperature and salinity. When sea ice forms in the polar regions due to <b>freezing</b> of <b>shelf</b> waters, sea water experiences a concurrent increase in salinity due to salt rejection and a decrease in temperature. The increase in the density of cold saline (i.e., thermohaline) water directly beneath the ice triggers the sinking of the water mass down the continental slope and the spreading of the water masses to other parts of the ocean. These are called thermohaline water masses and are akin to hyperpycnal flows due to their excess density. It is worth noting that facies models of both contourites (Stow and Faugères 2008) and hyperpycnites (Fig.  14 a) exhibit inverse to normal grading in ascending order and both have internal hiatus (Shanmugam 2016 b, his Fig. 9.19).|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{potential}} {{applications of}} ice-templating porous materials are constantly expanding, especially as scaffolds for tissue engineering. Ice-templating, a process utilizing ice nucleation and growth within an aqueous solution, {{consists of a}} cooling stage (before ice nucleation) and a freezing stage (during ice formation). While heat release during cooling can change scaffold isotropy, the freezing stage, where ice crystals grow and anneal, deter-mines the final size of scaffold features. To investigate the path of heat flow within collagen slurries during solidifi-cation, a series of ice-templating molds were designed with varying the contact area with the heat sink, {{in the form of}} the <b>freeze</b> drier <b>shelf.</b> Contact with the heat sink was found to be critical in determining the efficiency of the release of latent heat within the perspex molds. Isotropic collagen scaffolds were produced with pores which ranged from 90 lm up to 180 lm as the contact area decreased. In addition, low-temperature ice annealing was observed within the structures. After 20 h at- 30 C, conditions which mimic storage prior to lyophilization, scaffold architecture was observed to coarsen significantly. In future, ice-templating molds should consider not only heat conduction during the cooling phase of solidification, but the effects of heat flow during ice growth and annealing...|$|R

50|$|Shelf ice is a {{floating}} mat of ice, but unlike a pond {{or a small}} lake that <b>freezes</b> over, the <b>shelf</b> is not a uniform sheet of ice. Created by the wind and waves, the shelf ice is a jumble of ice chunks, pushed onto each other. It is as if you took a pile of rubble and pushed up against a wall. The more you push, the narrow the pile becomes, and it rises in a ridge. But there is nothing stable in the pile. The individual pieces (ice {{in the case of}} shelf ice) are not initially connected; they only float upon the water surface and rest upon each other. Many become jammed together but throughout the structure, there are pockets of air. Since each piece of ice developed independently, each is of a different thickness, creating variations in strength, density, and depth.|$|R
40|$|A {{few decades}} ago, Antarctic ice sheets were {{expected}} to grow as the atmosphere warmed and increasing poleward moisture transport added snowfall to regions that would remain below freezing year-round. Concerns about their sensitivity to climate change were centered on air temperature and on glacially paced ice dynamics. Southern Ocean roles were relegated to iceberg transport, a mix of melting and <b>freezing</b> under ice <b>shelves</b> buffered by the frigid shelf waters generated by sea ice production, and slow sea level rise by other forcing. At that time, observations were lacking in the remote Amundsen Sea, where difficult ice conditions have vexed explorers for more than 200 years. Mapping of its ocean structure and circulation began in 1994, revealing that "warm" Circumpolar Deep Water has access to its continental shelf. Glacially scoured troughs in the seafloor provide conduits for that seawater to melt regional ice shelves far more rapidly near their deep grounding lines. Coincident satellite data showed the ice shelves were thinning, in turn leading to accelerated glacier flow and loss of grounded ice to the sea. Repeated measurements and modeling suggest ocean changes that could impact {{the stability of the}} marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a temperature-sensitive vaccine formulation in a glass vial {{that needs to be}} frozen prior to lyophilization. The method for freezing the vial has traditionally been liquid nitrogen tunnel freezing, but this method can be expensive and has problems with sterilization of the tunnel. We explored the advantages of a shelf-freezing method and did a comparison analysis on the two freezing methods to determine which situation was the preferred one. For our analysis, the vaccine vial dimensions were obtained from research performed by Merck & Co., Inc. We predicted that the shelf-freezing method would take too long to freeze the vaccine, which in turn would decrease the potency of the vaccine. We simulated both freezing methods using the Gambit and FIDAP programs to produce two different designs. For the sensitivity analysis, we manipulated the boundary temperatures of the shelf and the liquid nitrogen as well as the convective coefficient for the ambient air in the shelf design. We determined that the <b>shelf</b> <b>freezing</b> method was the most optimal for the freezing of the vial when we lowered the shelf temperature due to the small differences in the freezing times between the two methods...|$|R
40|$|Large {{areas of}} the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf are {{underlain}} by layers of marine ice, which form when supercooled seawater circulating beneath the ice <b>shelf</b> <b>freezes.</b> The freezing process initially produces a suspension of disc-shaped frazil ice crystals, and these are subs quently deposited onto the ice shelf base {{in areas where the}} flow of water is slack enough. This has been modeled assuming that the freezing takes place within buoyant plumes of Ice Shelf Water ascending the ice shelf base from source regions near the grounding lines of the major inlet glaciers. The deposition {{of the majority of the}} suspended frazil ice is found to occur in spatially discrete bursts, where peak rates of accumulation at the ice shelf base exceed 1 m yr− 1 of solid ice. There is a good correlation between the location of the zones of crystal deposition and the position of the upstream limits of the marine ice layers. The high rates of localized accumulation account for the rapid buildup observed in the layer thickness, which then gradually declines as the marine ice is carried downstream with the flow of the ice shelf. Model results also suggest an origin for the ice platelets observed at depth in the water column near the Filchner Ice Shelf...|$|R
30|$|In {{the last}} 30 – 40  years, {{observations}} have indicated a warming of permafrost in many northern regions with a resulting degradation of ice- and carbon-rich permafrost. Increases of permafrost temperatures observed in Northern Eurasia and North America {{have resulted in}} the thawing of permafrost in natural, undisturbed conditions in areas close to the southern boundary of the permafrost zone (Romanovsky et al. 2010, 2017). Most of the permafrost observatories in Northern Eurasia show its substantial warming since the 1980 s. The magnitude of warming has varied with location, but was typically from 0.5 to 3  °C. In the regions where permafrost surface is already “warm” (i.e., where its temperature is close to the <b>freezing</b> point: Arctic <b>shelf</b> seas, riverbeds, edges of the present permafrost boundaries), such warming causes multiple changes in the terrestrial hydrological cycle, land cover, and man-made infrastructure (Pokrovsky et al. 2012; Shvidenko et al. 2013; Shiklomanov et al. 2017). The close proximity of the exceptionally ice-rich soil horizons to the ground surface, which is typical for the arctic tundra biome, makes tundra surfaces extremely sensitive to the natural and human-made changes that resulted in the development of processes such as thermokarst, thermal erosion, and retrogressive thaw slumps that strongly affect the stability of ecosystems and infrastructure (see “Research focus 7 : changes in infrastructure”). Figure 7 b shows the number of newly emerging thermokarst lakes in West Siberia which indicate the rate of degradation there of the upper layer of the permafrost. A main aim of the future NEFI efforts related to permafrost is to evaluate its vulnerability under climate warming across the permafrost regions of the northern and high-elevation Eurasia with respect to ecosystems stability, infrastructure, and socioeconomic impact. A second aim is to estimate the volume of newly thawed soils, which could be a potential source or sink of an additional amount of carbon in the Earth system.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop useful guidelines and algorithms to allow reliable scale-up of heat and mass transfer effects from laboratory to manufacturing scale lyophilizers. Scale up issues include variations in shelf surface temperature, heterogeneity in heat transfer rates with respect to position on the <b>shelf,</b> <b>freezing</b> variations between manufacturing and laboratory lyophilizers and variations that can occur due to differences in freeze dryer design. ^ Cake shrinkage during freeze-drying is related to the heat and mass transfer characteristics of the product and highlights the importance of product temperature control during drying. A combined experimental and theoretical approach was used to show that conditions of secondary drying impact cake shrinkage and that the product temperature should be maintained below the glass transition temperature throughout secondary drying. ^ Atypical radiation heat transfer experienced by edge vials due to their clear view of a warmer surface is responsible for their higher heat transfer rates and this atypical behavior poses a scale-up issue. Convection heat transfer was not responsible for this atypical behavior. Variation in the degree of supercooling between laboratory and manufacturing cycles may lead to significant variations in primary drying time. A correlation between product resistance during primary drying and the specific surface area of the product provided a quantitative prediction of the impact of freezing variations during scale up. Control of nucleation temperature within vials of the same batch was achieved by using an ice fog technique. ^ Data obtained from controlled sublimation tests on laboratory and manufacturing freeze dryers was used to estimate inter-vial variation in heat transfer rates based on design characteristics. Shelf non-uniformity, variable emissivities of representative surfaces, and the individual resistances offered by chamber, condenser and refrigeration system, are design parameters that were evaluated from sublimation tests. ^ Steady state heat and mass transfer theory was then used to combine data obtained for various scale-up issues in order to provide overall “rules and algorithms” for successful scale up from laboratory to manufacturing scale. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{body of work}} {{presented}} in this thesis are in three main parts: [1] the effect of ultrasound on freezing events of ionic systems, [2] the importance of formulation osmolality in freeze drying, and [3] a novel system for increasing primary freeze drying rate. Chapter 4 briefly presents the work on method optimisation, which {{is still very much}} in its infancy. Aspects of freezing such as nucleation and ice crystal growth are strongly related with ice crystal morphology; however, the ice nucleation process typically occurs in a random, non-deterministic and spontaneous manner. In view of this, ultrasound, an emerging application in pharmaceutical sciences, has been applied to aid in the acceleration of nucleation and shorten the freezing process. The research {{presented in}} this thesis aimed to study the effect of sonication on nucleation events in ionic solutions, and more importantly how sonication impacts on the freezing process. This work confirmed that nucleation does occur in a random manner. It also showed that ultrasonication aids acceleration of the ice nucleation process and increases the freezing rate of a solution. Cryopreservation of animal sperm is an important aspect of breeding in animal science especially for endangered species. In order for sperm cryopreservation to be successful, cryoprotectants as well as semen extenders are used. One of the factors allowing semen preservation media to be optimum is the osmolality of the semen extenders used. Although preservation of animal sperm has no relation with freeze drying of pharmaceuticals, it was used in this thesis to make a case for considering the osmolality of a formulation (prepared for freeze drying) as a factor for conferring protein protection against the stresses of freeze drying. The osmolalities of some common solutes (mostly sugars) used in freeze drying were determined (molal concentration from 0. 1 m to 1. 2 m). Preliminary investigation on the osmolality and osmotic coefficients of common solutes were carried out. It was observed that the osmotic coefficient trend for the sugars analysed could be grouped based on the types of sugar they are. The trends observed show the need for further studies to be carried out with osmolality and to determine how it may be of importance to protein or API protection during freeze drying processes. Primary drying is usually the longest part of the freeze drying process, and primary drying times lasting days or even weeks are not uncommon; however, longer primary drying times lead to longer freeze drying cycles, and consequently increased production costs. Much work has been done previously by others using different processes (such as annealing) in order to improve primary drying times; however, these do not come without drawbacks. A novel system involving the formation of a frozen vial system which results {{in the creation of a}} void between the formulation and the inside wall of a vial has been devised to increase the primary freeze drying rate of formulations without product damage. Although the work is not nearly complete, it has been shown that it is possible to improve and increase the primary drying rate of formulations without making any modifications to existing formulations, changing storage vials, or increasing the surface area of <b>freeze</b> dryer <b>shelves...</b>|$|R
40|$|We used in situ {{measurements}} and remote-sensing data sets {{to evaluate the}} mass budgets of the Lambert, Mellor and Fisher Glaciers and the basal melting and freezing rates beneath their flowbands on the Amery Ice Shelf. Our findings show the Lambert and Mellor Glaciers upstream of the ANARE Lambert Glacier Basin (LGB) traverse may have positive imbalances of 3. 9 ± 2. 1 Gt a&# 8722; 1 and 2. 1 ± 2. 4 Gt a&# 8722; 1, respectively, while the Fisher Glacier is approximately in balance. The upstream region {{as a whole has}} a positive imbalance of 5. 9 ± 4. 9 Gt a&# 8722; 1. The three same glaciers downstream of the ANARE LGB traverse line are in negative imbalance, where the whole downstream region has a negative imbalance of &# 8722; 8. 5 ± 5. 8 Gt a&# 8722; 1. Overall the mass budgets of the Lambert, Mellor, and Fisher Glaciers are close to balance, and the collective three-glacier system is also nearly in balance with a mass budget of &# 8722; 2. 6 ± 6. 5 Gt a&# 8722; 1. The significant positive imbalances for the interior basin upstream of the ice-movement stations established in the early 1970 s (GL line) reported previously are possibly due to an overestimate of the total accumulation and an underestimate of the ice flux through the GL line. The mean melting rate is &# 8722; 23. 0 ± 3. 5 m ice a&# 8722; 1 near the southern grounding line, which decreases rapidly downstream, and transitions to refreezing at around 300 km from the southern extremity of the Amery Ice <b>Shelf.</b> <b>Freezing</b> rates along the flowbands are around 0. 5 ± 0. 1 to 1. 5 ± 0. 2 m ice a&# 8722; 1.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify significant formulation and processing variables affecting levels of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in freeze-dried solids prepared from TBA/water cosolvent systems. The TBA concentration above which eutectic crystallization takes place was determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Model formulations were subjected to extremes of freezing rate by either dipping in liquid nitrogen or by slowly <b>freezing</b> on the <b>shelf</b> of a freeze-dryer. On the basis of these studies, the most important determinant of residual TBA level is the physical state of the solute. For freeze-dried sucrose, residual TBA levels were approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than freeze-dried glycine and were significantly affected by initial TBA concentration and freezing rate. For the sucrose/TBA/water system, relatively low residual TBA levels were obtained when the initial TBA level was above the threshold concentration for eutectic crystallization of TBA, whereas samples freeze-dried from solution containing TBA concentrations below this threshold contained significantly higher levels of TBA. Formulations of sucrose/TBA/water which were frozen rapidly contained residual TBA levels which were approximately twice those measured in the same formulation after slow freezing and drying under the same conditions. For the sucrose/TBA/water system, the temperature and time of secondary drying had only minimal influence on residual TBA in the freeze-dried solid. At low initial TBA concentrations (2 %), residual TBA increases with increased cake thickness, perhaps because of the influence of depth of fill on effective freezing rate. In addition, the feasibility of preparing freeze-dried solids of tobramycin base and tobramycin sulfate that readily break apart to form powders which can be poured from the vial was investigated by incorporating TBA as a cosolvent into the formulation. Frozen solutions of tobramycin base and tobramycin sulfate in water and in various concentration of t-butanol (TBA) were characterized by thermal analysis and freeze dry microscopy, and trial batches were prepared. For tobramycin base, rehumidification of freeze-dried solids, followed by additional secondary drying results in crystallization of tobramycin base, which results in residual TBA levels well below 1 %. For tobramycin sulfate, TBA/water eutectic crystallization is critical to minimize residual TBA in the freeze-dried solids. Formulations containing tobramycin sulfate allow the TBA/water eutectic mixture to crystallize readily as compared to tobramycin base, which promotes TBA removal during primary drying. Annealing at − 20 °C after the initial freezing process was shown to result in significantly lower residual TBA levels and significantly less vial-to-vial variability in residual TBA than without annealing by promoting eutectic crystallization of the TBA/water mixture. ...|$|R
