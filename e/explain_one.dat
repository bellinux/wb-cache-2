25|$|One miracle was {{required}} {{for her to be}} beatified and {{it had to be a}} healing that science and medicine could not <b>explain.</b> <b>One</b> such case arose and was investigated in a diocesan tribunal before the findings were submitted to the competent officials in Rome for further investigation. The C.C.S. validated this process on 30 June 1984 while a panel of medical experts approved the miraculous nature of this healing on 27 June 1991. Theologians approved it as well on 20 December 1991 after confirming the miracle came as a result of Martillo's intercession while the C.C.S. approved the findings of both bodies on 18 February 1992. John Paul II approved this miracle on 7 March 1992 and beatified her in Saint Peter's Square on 25 October 1992.|$|E

500|$|The {{work was}} written {{sometime}} in the early 13th century, and is explicitly dedicated to Frederick II. The scholar James Wood Brown argues that the book was likely written and then presented to soon-to-be Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in AD 1209 {{on the occasion of}} his wedding to Constance of Aragon. Brown also adds, [...] "No date suits this publication so well as 1209, and nothing but the urgent desire of Court and people that the marriage should prove fruitful can <b>explain,</b> <b>one</b> might add excuse, some passages of almost fescennine license which it contains." [...] The philosophy and religion scholar Irven Resnick argues that the work was given to Frederick so that [...] "the emperor [...] to distinguish, from outward appearances, trustworthy and wise counselors from their opposite numbers." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} [...] "guinea" [...] in [...] "guinea pig" [...] {{is harder to}} <b>explain.</b> <b>One</b> {{proposed}} {{explanation is that the}} animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea, leading people to think they had originated there. [...] "Guinea" [...] was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal's exotic appeal. Another hypothesis suggests the [...] "guinea" [...] in the name is a corruption of [...] "Guiana", an area in South America. A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold {{for the price of a}} guinea coin; this hypothesis is untenable, because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and William Harvey used the term [...] "Ginny-pig" [...] as early as 1653. Others believe [...] "guinea" [...] may be an alteration of the word [...] (rabbit); guinea pigs were referred to as [...] "pig coneys" [...] in Edward Topsell's 1607 treatise on quadrupeds.|$|E

2500|$|Social role theory may <b>explain</b> <b>one</b> {{reason for}} why {{occupational}} sexism exists. [...] Historically women's place {{was in the}} home, while the males were in the workforce.

60|$|It is {{now more}} than fifteen years since I first showed, by a careful {{examination}} of all the facts to be accounted for, that the hypothesis of a Lemurian continent was alike unnecessary to <b>explain</b> <b>one</b> portion of the facts, and inadequate to explain the remaining portion.[103] Since that time I have seen no attempt even to discuss the question on general grounds in opposition to my views, nor {{on the other hand}} have those who have hitherto supported the hypothesis taken any opportunity of acknowledging its weakness and inutility. I have therefore here explained my reasons for rejecting it somewhat more fully and in a more popular form, in the hope that a check may thus be placed on the continued re-statement of this unsound theory as if it were one of the accepted conclusions of modern science.|$|E
