25|$|The gopher {{tortoise}} (<b>Gopherus</b> polyphemus) is {{a species}} of the <b>Gopherus</b> genus native to the southeastern United States.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{protected}} and threatened species living in Edwards, {{the most notable}} being the desert tortoise (<b>Gopherus</b> agassizii). It is illegal to touch, harass or otherwise harm a desert tortoise. Another notable species is Yucca brevifolia: the taller members of this species are called Joshua trees.|$|E
25|$|Usually seen in {{the summer}} sunning {{themselves}} or crossing the road later in the day. The tiny rattle makes a buzzing sound {{that can only be}} heard from a few feet. Some individuals are very aggressive and will strike furiously, while others seem lethargic and do not even attempt to rattle. They do not dig their own burrows, but rather use those dug by small rodents or gopher tortoises (<b>Gopherus</b> polyphemus).|$|E
25|$|Other {{reptiles}} in {{the region}} include lizards and turtles. Lizards are highly represented {{in the region}}, the most distinctive denizen being the Gila monster, native only to the American Southwest {{and the state of}} Sonora in Mexico. Other lizards include: Sonoran collared lizard (Crotaphytus nebrius); several types of geckos, including western banded gecko (Coleonyx variegatus), the common house gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus), and the Mediterranean house gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus), the last two species being non-native to the region but have been introduced; the desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis); the chuckwalla (Sauromalus ater); the greater earless lizard (Cophosaurus texanus scitulus); several sub-species of horned lizards (Phrynosoma); numerous species of spiny lizards (Sceloporus); Gilbert's skink (Plestiodon gilberti); the western skink (Plestiodon skiltonianus); Trans-Pecos striped whiptail (Aspidoscelis inornata heptagrammus); and the Arizona night lizard (Xantusia arizonae). Turtles are less numerous than their other reptilian counterparts, but several are found in the region, including: the western painted turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii); the Rio Grande cooter (Pseudemys gorzugi); the desert box turtle (Terrapene ornata luteola); the Big Bend slider (Trachemys gaigeae gaigeae); the Sonora mud turtle (Kinosternon sonoriense); and the desert tortoise (<b>Gopherus</b> agassizii).|$|E
500|$|The mouse is an omnivore, {{measures}} [...] {{in total}} length, has relatively large ears, and displays brown to orange upperparts and white underparts. [...] The mouse breeds throughout the year, and raises its {{two or three}} young per litter in the nesting chambers and passages it constructs in the burrow of the gopher tortoise (<b>Gopherus</b> polyphemus). [...] Real estate development {{and a decline in}} the gopher tortoise population threaten the mouse's future. The species is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN.|$|E
500|$|The Florida mouse {{has been}} called the gopher mouse because it shares the long, deep burrow of the gopher {{tortoise}} (<b>Gopherus</b> polyphemus). [...] The mouse makes nest chambers, small side passages, sometimes a pad of oak leaves and wiregrasses for chamber floors, and small chimney openings in the roof of the burrow. [...] It uses these openings, the main entrance, and side passages for entrance to and exit from the burrow. [...] In the absence of gopher tortoise burrows, the mouse will use those of the oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) or will make its own.|$|E

2500|$|Since July 7, 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has listed <b>Gopherus</b> polyphemus as [...] "Threatened" [...] {{wherever}} the tortoises are found {{west of the}} Mobile and Tombigbee Rivers in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Its status is listed as [...] "Under Review" [...] in Florida and in other locations. On November 9, 2009, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed rulemaking to include the eastern population of <b>Gopherus</b> polyphemus in the List of Threatened Wildlife. G. polyphemus appears on the IUCN Red List as a [...] "Vulnerable" [...] species; however, {{it has not been}} assessed {{for the purposes of this}} list since 1996. In July 2011, United States Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) determined that listing the eastern population of the tortoise as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act is warranted, however, it is precluded from doing so at this time due to higher priority actions and a lack of sufficient funds to commence proposed rule development. In the interim period of time the USFWS [...] will place the eastern population of the tortoise on its candidate species list until sufficient funding is available to initiate a proposed listing rule.|$|E
2500|$|Gopher {{tortoises}}, {{like other}} tortoises {{of the genus}} <b>Gopherus,</b> {{are known for their}} digging ability. Gopher tortoises {{spend most of their time}} in long burrows, up to [...] in length and [...] deep. In these burrows, the tortoises are protected from summer heat, winter cold, fire, and predators. The burrows are especially common in longleaf pine savannas, where the tortoises are the primary grazers, playing an essential role in their ecosystem. Except during breeding season, gopher tortoises are solitary animals, inhabiting a small home range. Within their range they dig several burrows. On average, each gopher tortoise needs about [...] to live.|$|E
2500|$|In {{some areas}} {{tortoises}} {{are more important}} in the diet than snakes, and they displace mammals and birds as the most important prey group in most of Southeastern Europe as well as the Caucasus. Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and Greek tortoises (Testudo graeca) made up 55.4% of the prey in two nests in Bulgaria and 52.9% of the prey in 19 nests in the Republic of Macedonia. The same species are also prevalent in the diet of eagles from Greece, but no quantitative analysis is known from that country. Russian tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii) made up 31.9% of the prey in 5 nests in Turkmenistan and 25.4% of the prey in 36 nests in Kazakhstan. When hunting tortoise, golden eagles use a unique technique: they pick up the tortoise and fly up to at least [...] above the rocky ground, then drop the tortoise onto the terrain below in the hope of smashing open its hard shell. The only other bird species confirmed to hunt vertebrates in this way is the lammergeier (Gypaetus barbatus), although gulls may use a similar technique on hard-shelled prey such as mussels. The larger desert tortoise (<b>Gopherus</b> agassizii) of North America has occasionally turned up as prey there. Other turtles have been reported as being hunted, such as painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) in Washington state and baby loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in Corsica, but essentially are a negligible part of the diet.|$|E
