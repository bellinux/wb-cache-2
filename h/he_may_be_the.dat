5|$|Blois was {{frequently}} {{a witness to}} Puiset's charters, and was named as rector of a parish church {{in the city of}} Durham, appointed by Puiset. By the late 1180s, Blois had moved to the household of Hugh of Avalon, the Bishop of Lincoln. Blois was a subdean, an ecclesiastical official, of the diocese of Lincoln by 22 March 1194, probably from about 1189. He was a frequent witness to Hugh's charters in the late 1180s. Although he was now serving Hugh, Blois did not entirely quit the service of Puiset, and was present at Puiset's deathbed in 1195. He was named precentor of Lincoln in 1197, in succession to the medieval writer Walter Map. Besides Hugh and Puiset, he also served Pope Innocent III. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Master William of Blois who is a witness to some Scottish charters.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} what became of Aetios after that. He most likely lost power upon Nikephoros's accession, but <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> patrikios Aetios who was killed, along with Nikephoros himself, in the Battle of Pliska against the Bulgars on July 26, 811.|$|E

25|$|Agassi {{founded the}} Andre Agassi Charitable Association in 1994, which assists Las Vegas' young people. He {{was awarded the}} ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian award in 1995 for his efforts to help {{disadvantaged}} youth. He is regularly cited as the most charitable and socially involved player in professional tennis. It has also been claimed that <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most charitable athlete of his generation.|$|E
25|$|Aaron Burr {{was a man}} {{of complex}} {{character}} who made many friends, but also many powerful enemies. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most controversial of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was indicted for murder after the death of Hamilton, but never prosecuted; he was reported by acquaintances to be curiously unmoved by Hamilton's death, expressing no regret {{for his role in the}} result. He was arrested and prosecuted for treason by President Jefferson, but acquitted.|$|E
25|$|In {{the reign}} of King Edgar (959-975), Pershore reappears {{as one of the}} abbeys to be re-established (or restored) under the {{programme}} of Benedictine reform. Writing c. 1000, the Ramsey monk Byrhtferth relates that under the auspices of Oswald, bishop of Worcester, seven monasteries were founded in his diocese, notably including Pershore. The first abbot was one Foldbriht, whose name is sufficiently rare to suggest that <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same Foldbriht whom Bishop Æthelwold previously installed at Abingdon and used to be a monk of Glastonbury before that time.|$|E

25|$|The dogs {{join the}} people, their {{inclusion}} with the servants in the portrait invites commentary on Graham's circle. Trump's officious pose and lolling tongue, while wearing Graham's wig and brandishing the scroll of paper, makes {{light of the}} formality of Graham's position. Trump represents Hogarth in the painting, while his pose with the scroll, as used by musical conductors of the time, suggest that <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> humorous conductor for the music and singing taking place. The steward stands at {{the left of the}} painting under a hanging crown compass, and carelessly drips gravy down the chaplain's neck, adding a final element of farce to the setting. In the relaxed and informal setting of the cabin, adding touches of humour and foolishness, Hogarth provides a contrast with the dangers of the pitched battle that the painting commemorates.|$|E
500|$|Frederick Reines ( [...] March 16, 1918 – August 26, 1998) was an American physicist. He {{was awarded}} the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physics for his co-detection of the {{neutrino}} with Clyde Cowan in the neutrino experiment. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only scientist in history [...] "so intimately associated {{with the discovery of}} an elementary particle and the subsequent thorough investigation of its fundamental properties".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Sue {{informs the}} staff {{that the school}} is in {{financial}} trouble, {{and the only way}} to raise money is to gain alumni donations from the upcoming football game or face firing a teacher. German teacher Willard Deutschebog informs English teacher Ennis Hofftard that a student may have caught him buying [...] "filthies" [...] (porn) at a newsstand that morning; because of this, Willard fears that if Sue hears, <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one getting fired. At the same time, Larry attempts to ask Miracle out on a date, but finds he cannot stand Miracle's [...] "stupid" [...] thoughts. As it turns out, she was the one responsible for his students' poor training in gym: she repeatedly throws out food, in honor of those in third-world countries.|$|E
5000|$|Nothing {{certain is}} known about his life. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> a [...] "Walter Cantor" [...] at Ely Cathedral between 1443 and 1466, and <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> Walter Frye who joined the London Parish Clerks in 1456; <b>he</b> also <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> Walter Frye who left a will at Canterbury in 1474.|$|R

500|$|Prior to the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, William Houston of The Globe and Mail wrote, [...] "The best of {{the group}} is Soviet star winger Pavel Bure, a {{spectacular}} player with outstanding speed. He is compared to Vladimir Krutov and also the late Soviet superstar of the 1970s, Valeri Kharlamov." [...] NHL organizations were afraid he would not leave the Soviet Union {{to play in the}} NHL thus deterring teams from selecting him early, although scouts and analysts believed he could have been selected as high as the second round had he defected. Many analysts compared him to Valeri Khalarmov. Edmonton Oilers' scout Barry Fraser commented, [...] "From what I've seen of him, Bure can play on any team in the NHL right now... he's quick, real quick, small and very exciting. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> top player in this year's draft, but because he is from the Soviet Union, we don't analyze him the same way as a kid from the West... I don't expect him to go really early because it is still too much of a gamble to hope he will defect." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{wrote and}} {{performed}} children's music {{that was different}} from {{what had been done}} previously; as Cook stated, [...] "we didn't just go down the route of what people think is kids' music". [...] They were not tied to one style or genre of music and often experimented in the studio; while some of their recordings were orchestral, others had a more live feel. The group was aware that their songs were often children's first exposure to music. Guitar Magazine speculated that since Cook {{was one of the first}} guitarists children were exposed to, <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most influential guitarist in the world. [...] Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see, and said, [...] "I always think that if it inspires kids to play guitar later on that would be great. I think it would be really nice if in 15years I read that somebody got into guitar playing because of [...] Wiggles". [...] In 2013, after Cook retired from touring with the group and became their touring manager, he reported that newer bands like Regular John approached him and said that The Wiggles were the first band [...] "they got into".|$|E
500|$|Two months later, amid {{reports that}} paleoconservative {{political}} commentator and adviser Pat Buchanan {{was about to}} join the Reform Party to seek the nomination, Trump {{announced that he would}} consider running as a sign of respect for Ventura. He labeled the views of Buchanan as [...] "prehistoric", and commented that even though he liked Pat, [...] "I'm on the conservative side, but Buchanan is Attila the Hun." [...] He expected that a primary battle between the two would be [...] "nasty." [...] According to columnist Robert Novak, Bush operatives concerned about a third party run by Buchanan contacted Ventura indirectly about preventing Buchanan's nomination. [...] Novak argued that Trump [...] "seems a bad match with Perot's party, but <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> GOP's last hope to stop Buchanan." [...] When Weicker decided not to seek the party's nomination due to internal bickering, Ventura reportedly went all in for Trump. [...] The media capitalized on a potential Trump versus Buchanan challenge, and Saturday Night Live satirized it with a skit in which Darrell Hammond portraying Trump and Chris Parnell as Buchanan pitched their candidacies to Ross Perot, played by Cheri Oteri. The segment also featured an appearance by Will Ferrell as Ventura.|$|E

500|$|Reviews were universally {{less than}} {{positive}} on other systems. While critics praised {{the idea of}} the game, they found fault in the execution. Several critics disliked that the troops spawned by the player simply walk past the troops spawned by the opponent without the two groups fighting. The game's flow also attracted significant criticism, with Peter Eykemans of IGN saying [...] "Even on double speed, the pace is painful. This makes a simple two-person battle turn into a lengthy saga of repeating the same actions over and over again." [...] and Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly complaining of [...] "long drawn out matches on even the easiest difficulty settings as you try to force your way past a virtual stalemate". While the visuals did receive praise, critics felt that they also {{got in the way of}} allowing the player to tell what was going on in the game. Opinions about the narrator were mixed. Henry Winchester of PC Gamer praised the voiceover, calling it [...] "a pleasingly booze-obsessed voiceover, delivered by what sounds like a Dalek doing an impression of Sean Connery". Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly was less kind, stating that [...] "your narrator and chief advisor sounds like an awful Sean Connery impersonator and <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best of the voice actors you come across". GamesRadar strikes a more neutral tone, stating that [...] "Pre and post-battle dialog is fully voiced by what are only technically 'actors,' but it definitely beats silent text, and does add a bit of flavor to the world." [...] Multiplayer also received mixed reviews. Eykemans of IGN suggested that multiplayer exacerbates the length and flow issues already present in the single player game, while Matt Hughes of GamesRadar calls multiplayer the game's [...] "biggest asset", stating that [...] "Playing against real humans definitely ramps up the intensity and reduces the cheap exploitation found in the campaign.".|$|E

2500|$|Cat, {{from the}} British sci-fi sitcom Red Dwarf, is another example. The {{character}} has no name other than [...] "The Cat" [...] or simply [...] "Cat". He is the humanoid descendant {{of a modern}} domestic cat called Frankenstein who had been Dave Lister's pregnant pet cat. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last remaining member of his species, Felis sapiens.|$|E

2500|$|The name of Gondophares was {{translated}} in Armenian in [...] "Gastaphar", {{and then in}} Western languages into [...] "Gaspar". <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Gaspar, King of Persia", who, according to apocryphal texts and eastern Christian tradition, {{was one of the}} three Biblical Magi who attended the birth of Christ. Through this interaction and association, Gaspar was adopted by the Europeans (and in Western tradition) as a male first name.|$|E
2500|$|There is a possibility, never {{established}} or fully investigated, that <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same Robert Morton {{who became}} Bishop of Worcester, and {{who died in}} 1497. [...] Evidence for this connection includes the complete lack of documentation for the bishop between 1456 and 1476, when Morton {{was active in the}} Burgundian court, and the presence of Cardinal John Morton, uncle of the future bishop, in Burgundy at exactly the time when Robert disappears from the payment rolls.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} with {{certainty}} about his life. [...] <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same as Antonio da Genova, a musician {{who worked in}} Ferrara in 1462, and he is probably the [...] "Antonius de Jan." [...] referenced in {{the archives of the}} Genoese ducal palace in 1456; [...] "Janue" [...] has been interpreted as meaning [...] "of Genoa." [...] If these are the same person, he would seem to have been an active composer in northern Italy in the 1450s.|$|E
