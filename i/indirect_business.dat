5000|$|However, many {{developed}} countries estimate input-output accounts annually and with much greater recency. This is because while most uses of the input-output analysis focus on the matrix set of inter-industry exchanges, the actual focus of the analysis {{from the perspective of}} most national statistical agencies is the benchmarking of gross domestic product. Input-output tables therefore are an instrumental part of national accounts. As suggested above, the core input-output table reports only intermediate goods and services that are exchanged among industries. But an array of row vectors, typically aligned at the bottom of this matrix, record non-industrial inputs by industry like payments for labor; <b>indirect</b> <b>business</b> taxes; dividends, interest, and rents; capital consumption allowances (depreciation); other property-type income (like profits); and purchases from foreign suppliers (imports). At a national level, although excluding the imports, when summed this is called [...] "gross product originating" [...] or [...] "gross domestic product by industry." [...] Another array of column vectors is called [...] "final demand" [...] or [...] "gross product consumed." [...] This displays columns of spending by households, governments, changes in industry stocks, and industries on investment, as well as net exports. (See also Gross domestic product.) In any case, by employing the results of an economic census which asks for the sales, payrolls, and material/equipment/service input of each establishment, statistical agencies back into estimates of industry-level profits and investments using the input-output matrix as a sort of double-accounting framework.|$|E

The analysis shows that companies using direct business models have a significantly lower financial performance than companies using <b>indirect</b> <b>business</b> models.

The Varshney/Tootelian report estimate of $ 182. 6 billion gross state product loss is 10 % of the total output of the California economy.

Thus the question arises as to how the authors came to these results and whether the estimates have any credibility.

Understanding the spread of economic stimulus and subsequent <b>indirect</b> <b>business</b> and consumption effects is important because of the changing patterns of business operations, employment and supply chains in the resources sector. The focus of the research reported in this paper was to identify the geographical spread of economic impacts from the resources sector across Queensland. The results of the analysis demonstrate that incomes and expenditures from the resources sectors are widely distributed across the state, and generate significant flow-on effects. It is notable that the industry makes a strong direct contribution in many of the more remote areas of Queensland, helping to underpin economic conditions in those regions.

Economic effects are {{measured in terms of}} three economic variables. Gross state product (GSP) is the broadest measure of the economy, consisting of employee compensation, proprietors ’ income, property income, and <b>indirect</b> <b>business</b> taxes. Labor income is the portion of GSP comprised of employee compensation and proprietors ’ income. Employment is a count of full- and part-time jobs expressed at an annual rate.

Multiplier effects derive from interindustry transactions and the consumer spending of affected workers. Interindustry effects arise when construction firms purchase services and materials from other Arizona suppliers. Industries with significant linkages to the construction industry are architectural and engineering services, general merchandise stores, wholesale trade, building materials, and transportation services.
