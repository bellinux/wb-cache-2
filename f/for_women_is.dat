25|$|The Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran is {{responsible}} for developing and maintaining the Iranian rial, which serves as the country's currency. The government doesn't recognize trade unions other than the Islamic labour councils, which {{are subject to the}} approval of employers and the security services. The minimum wage in June 2013 was 487 million rials a month ($134).

25|$|According to verse 4:32 of Islam's sacred text, {{both men}} and women have an {{independent}} economic position: 'For men is a portion of what they earn, and <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>is</b> a portion of what they earn. Ask God for His grace. God has knowledge of all things.' Women therefore are at liberty to buy, sell, mortgage, lease, borrow or lend, and sign contracts and legal documents. Additionally, women can donate money, act as trustees and set up a business or company. These rights cannot be altered, irrespective of marital status. When a woman is married, she legally has total control over the dowerthe mahr or bridal gift, usually financial in nature, while the groom pays to the bride upon marriageand retains this control in the event of divorce.|$|E
25|$|Women {{tend to have}} {{different}} occupational hazards and health issues than men in the workplace. Women get carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, anxiety disorders, stress, respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases due to their work at higher rates than men. The reasons for these differences may be differences in biology or in the work that women are performing. Women's higher rates of job-related stress {{may be due to}} the fact that women are often caregivers at home and do contingent work and contract work at a much higher rate than men. Another significant occupational hazard <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>is</b> homicide, which was the second most frequent cause of death on the job for women in 2011, making up 26% of workplace deaths in women. Immigrant women are at higher risk for occupational injury than native-born women in the United States, due to higher rates of employment in dangerous industries.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the biggest}} {{obstacle}} to higher education <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>is</b> the physical and cultural distance of the universities from Negev Bedouin towns. Even the nearest universities require significant travel time to and from campus. In many instances, Bedouin women are only permitted {{to make the trip}} if accompanied by a male relative. Moreover, the university is a very different cultural space than Negev Bedouin towns. Jewish-Israeli culture is largely modern and secular, as opposed to the traditional, religious culture in Negev Bedouin society. This pronounced cultural difference is both an obstacle to enrolling at universities and a challenge women must overcome once they arrive. Additionally, societal pressure to marry young can conflict with attaining a university education. While there have been cases where women could attain a university education after marrying, the familial responsibilities (childcare and housework, for instance) provide additional challenges to completing their studies. Further, studying after marriage is entirely dependent upon the approval of the women's husbands. In other words, women are always dependent upon male consent for their studies, either from their fathers (or other male guardians) or their husbands. Finally, the lack of female employment opportunities means that studying at a university {{does not seem to be}} a reasonable investment, especially in instances where family resources are limited.|$|E

500|$|A 2005 study {{reported}} that, among {{a sample of}} undergraduate students, the most frequently cited sources for knowledge about the clitoris were school and friends, {{and that this was}} associated with the least amount of tested knowledge. Knowledge of the clitoris by self-exploration was the least cited, but [...] "respondents correctly answered, on average, three of the five clitoral knowledge measures". The authors stated that [...] "nowledge correlated significantly with the frequency of women's orgasm in masturbation but not partnered sex" [...] and that their [...] "results are discussed in light of gender inequality and a social construction of sexuality, endorsed by both men and women, that privileges men's sexual pleasure over women's, such that orgasm <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>is</b> pleasing, but ultimately incidental." [...] They concluded that part of the solution to remedying [...] "this problem" [...] requires that males and females are taught more about the clitoris than is currently practiced.|$|E
500|$|The modern Summer Olympic Games {{have been}} held every four years since the first Games in 1896 (except 1916 due to the First World War, and 1940 and 1944 due to the Second World War) and Olympic records are {{recognised}} by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in each event. [...] The athletics events, which take place at each Games, are divided into four groups: track events (including sprints, middle- and long-distance running, hurdling and relays), field events (including javelin, discus, hammer, pole vault, long and triple jumps), road events (such as walks and the marathon) and combined events (the heptathlon and the decathlon). [...] Women compete in 23 athletics events during the Games, and men compete in 24; while 21 of the events are the same {{for both men and}} women, men exclusively compete in the 50km walk, the women's combined event is the heptathlon while the men compete in the decathlon, and the short distance hurdles <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>is</b> contested over 100m, ten metres shorter than the men's event.|$|E
500|$|Wearing Antoinist {{religious}} clothing {{indicates an}} intense {{involvement in the}} religion by the person who makes this choice. Although not mandatory, it is devoted to faithful who perform the worship, celebrations and other tasks in the temple—all of them are called [...] "moral work", as {{they are expected to}} participate in the moral elevation of followers. It was in 1906 that Antoine wore a special clothe for the first time, and it was the case of the faithful in 1910. Entirely black, the dress for men was designed by Antoine, and that for women by Catherine, who precisely codified their dimensions in their writings. There are also dresses for young people of both sexes, but they are never actually worn. Historically, the wearing of the dress {{was the subject of a}} debate among the first Antoinists, some of them refusing to wear it, and even generated a scandal so that Antoine had to justify himself on this subject, saying it had been revealed by inspiration. In the past, the dress was also worn in the street, and that was how the followers were immediately identified by the public. Currently, it is generally only worn in the context of worship, and it is put and removed in the locker room of the temple. Clothing for men is composed of a dress which resembles the one worn by Catholic clergy in the monastery, and closed by 13 buttons, plus a cashmere top hat. Clothing <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>is</b> a wide dress accompanied with a cape and a bonnet with a veil. In the Antoinist view, the collar is important as it is believed that the fluid resides here.|$|E
