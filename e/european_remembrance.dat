40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the wider}} context of policy conflict concerning public {{memory of the}} 1989 events. It uses Pierre Nora’s concept of lieux de mémoire in trying to explain why 23 August 1939 {{has been turned into}} a <b>European</b> <b>Remembrance</b> Day whereas 9 November 1989 has not. By investigating closely the role that various memory actors played during debates at the European level, it advances the idea that the anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact has been more successful in establishing itself within the <b>European</b> <b>remembrance</b> landscape because it has allowed for the promotion of a unifying narrative of the European past. In doing so, the article questions the frequently advanced idea that memory clashes in the EU form around an East–West divide that in some cases overlaps with a Right–Left divide. The analysis digs deep into the complex dynamics lying at the heart of memory contests concerning the end of the Cold War within the EU and provides a more differentiated view of discussions preceding EU decisions on policies of memory...|$|E
5000|$|<b>European</b> Network <b>Remembrance</b> and Solidarity (ENRS) {{was created}} in 2005 as a joint {{initiative}} by German, Hungarian, Polish, and Slovak ministers of culture. In 2014 Romania joined the structure. The purpose of the ENRS is to document and promote the study of European 20th-century history {{and how it is}} remembered. Its fields of interest evolve around times of dictatorial regimes, wars, and resistance to oppression. The organization supports academic research, educational projects and promotional events, through a network of international scholars and ENRS partner institutions. Network’s actions contribute to building better relations between European societies through discussing the common past. All program decisions are made by ENRS' international supervisory body.Since 2010, its projects are coordinated by the Secretariat of <b>European</b> Network <b>Remembrance</b> and Solidarity, which has its seat in Warsaw. From 2010 to 2014 the Secretariat was affiliated with Poland's National Centre for Culture. In early 2015, the Polish Minister of Culture and National Heritage, Professor Małgorzata Omilanowska appointed a new independent cultural institution called the Institute of <b>European</b> Network <b>Remembrance</b> and Solidarity.|$|R

40|$|The Eastern {{enlargement}} of the European Union has intensified calls for the reconstruction of a common <b>European</b> <b>remembrance</b> of the continent's multiple totalitarian legacies. Various political initiatives to condemn, along with counter-attempts to re-legitimize, the legacy of communism have emerged at the pan-European level. Each aspires to leave an imprint on the symbolic moral order and the legal regime of the broader European community. This article builds a conceptual framework for understanding the contestation of political and juridical regulation of the transnational remembrance of totalitarian communist regimes in Europe. Critically engaging the concept of cosmopolitanization of memory, {{it is argued that}} mnemonic identity in Europe is being transformed via new claims on “European memory. ” These claims are being made by various East European actors seeking recognition of the region's particular historical legacies as part of the pan-European normative verdict on twentieth-century totalitarianisms...|$|E
40|$|This {{special issue}} {{addresses}} the nexus between transnational politics of remembrance, European integration and an emerging European public sphere. The overall {{goal is to}} develop a novel understanding of how symbolic politics are negotiated and implemented at the transnational level and how they are translated into local, national and supranational practices. The authors investigate transnational politics of remembrance using a variety of methods, thus moving beyond single-country and comparative studies. Approaches employed include ethnographic research, network analysis, elite interviews and policy analysis, among others. The articles assembled here offer innovative theoretical and empirical insights that go beyond abstract and normative perspectives that have dominated this area of research thus far. They address three key themes. In the first set of articles, <b>European</b> <b>remembrance</b> is analyzed as a field of transnational policy making in which individual and institutional actors compete through the use of various resources and the articulation of norms, interests, divergent political cultures and practices. Processes of agenda-setting, lobbying, decision-making, and implementation in the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and other transnational arenas are spotlighted here. In the second set of articles, authors take a relational perspective, examining how actors at different levels (local, national, supranational) cooperate, sometimes bypassing “official” channels of policy-making. These articles seek to answer the question of how network structures impact European memory-making in new ways. The third set of articles investigates how European memory is shaped by “marginal voices. ” They offer insight into how historical experiences such as slavery, migration, and the persecution of Roma are in- or excluded from European commemoration...|$|E
