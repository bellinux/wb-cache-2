Esto traerá nuevos retos para la operación y el diseño de la red. Una de las áreas críticas más afectadas que existe es la de las protecciones eléctricas. En este trabajo se hace el estudio de cómo se afectan los ajustes de las protecciones eléctricas al trabajar con generación distribuida en una red de distribución. Para ello se simuló una red con la ayuda del {{software}} denominado PSX. Se conectó generación en distintos lugares, de diferentes capacidades y tipos. Se calcularon los niveles de cortocircuitos en los distintos escenarios para los cuales fueron ajustadas las protecciones.

The software is reviewed in this paper from several perspectives including those of natural resource economics, systems modeling, and the social context within which FERC licensing decisions are made. We examine both the software and its underlying methodology and find significant problems with each. Because of its flaws, AWARE(TM) does little to further ECPA's equal consideration requirement.

40|$|Nowadays, and in {{the next}} future, the {{increase}} of the Dispersed Generation (DG) will alter significantly the operation of distribution networks.
