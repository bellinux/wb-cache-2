Also these models are used to realize many practical systems. In this paper environmental noise signals are modelled and these modelled noise signals {{can be used as a}} reference noise signal for the noise cancellation system when the type of noise is not known priori. In this work, an approach to model the environmental noises using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Fuzzy Hidden Markov models (FHMM) are used and thereby use the modelled noise as reference noise input for cancelling the encountered noise using Fuzzy Recursive Least Square algorithm (FRLS) is proposed. The system is tested for various <b>noises</b> like <b>horn</b> <b>noises</b> from bus, car and babble noise. The performance of both the algorithms is compared. Experimental results show that Fuzzy Recursive Least Square algorithm with reference noise from fuzzy HMM based modelled noise provides 33 % better performance than Recursive Least Square algorithm with reference noise from HMM based modelled noise...|$|R

They will have 3-6 eggs {{and will have}} their babies from September to April. Then they will hatch and turn into feathery little trumpeter swan babies. This creature will live in lakes, ponds and freshwater. The size of this mammal is 150-183 cm and the width is 2-4 meters. The swan can weigh up to 28 lbs. This extraordinary creature’s diet is leaves, seeds and roots. Wild swans will eat leftover grains and vegetables and they will also eat algae and aquatic plants. trumpeter swans predators are snapping turtles, coyotes, river otters, mink, golden eagles, great horned owls and raccoons. The way they communicate is by making French <b>horn</b> <b>noises</b> like koh-hoh and oh-ho. Majority of them migrate {{all the way from}} Load farm, which is in the United States to the Yukon.

50|$|The ShakeAlert system alerts the {{surrounding}} populations of an earthquake {{that has already}} happened. When the system detects the earthquake, {{the first step is}} to release several <b>horn</b> <b>noises</b> at a high volume level. Next, an automated voice yells out the words earthquake. The shaking that follows can start after varying intervals of time- anywhere from a couple seconds to several minutes. The purpose of then ShakeAlert system is not to predict an earthquake before it happens, but instead to determine and locate the earthquake as soon as it begins to happen. Within a single second, ShakeAlert can detect the location and severity of the earthquake to warn people of its presence.The people that these type of signals reach can vary. In the state of California, where earthquakes happen quite often, some of those most important listeners of this system include the Bay area’s rapid transit system (BART). Other important organizations that need to know the early onset of earthquakes are Fire Departments all along the west coast, as well as places like Disneyland, where a large population of people is limited to a relatively small geographical space. BART is already directly connected to the ShakeAlert system, so if the system were to send out early warnings of an earthquake, the metro system will automatically pause and adjust its trains to prevent serious accidents or derailments. Doug Given, one of the main leaders of the project, also serves as the National Earthquake Early Warning Coordinator for the U.S. Geological Survey. He explains in an interview with National Public Radio, the way in which the system is designed to alert the public. He explains that the system plans to reach populations in a similar way that the public receives Amber alerts.|$|R

Inspired by Jimi Hendrix, he took up guitar when he was {{bedridden}} for several months with mononucleosis. Not inclined to formal music study, Belew was nonetheless a quick developer and rapidly became a high-school guitar hero. Mostly teaching himself by listening to records, he was ignorant of the studio trickery and sound manipulation used to create particular guitar lines, and so found ways of replicating them himself manually using unusual playing techniques and a growing interest in effects and treatments. While maturing {{as a player and}} mastering various playing styles. Belew became increasingly preoccupied with ways to avoid [...] "sounding like everybody else". He eventually found his own sound and style by learning how to make his guitar mimic sound effects (such as car <b>horns,</b> animal <b>noises,</b> or industrial sound) and then applying those sounds to relatively standard songs.|$|R

It was hosted by John Bunnell, a retired police officer and former Sheriff of Multnomah County, Oregon. Bunnell's commentary was often characterized by multiple clichés, over-dramatic descriptions of the struggle between good and evil, the police and criminals, victims and abusers, etc. Although Bunnell hosted and commented {{on most of the}} show, most police video segments were dubbed with the actual law enforcement officials acting in the situation presented. Tire screeching <b>noises,</b> <b>horn</b> beeps, automobile collision sounds and sirens are often overdubbed into these segments. This is especially noticeable in footage where vehicles are driving over dry grass or sand, and the sounds of tire screeching can still be heard.|$|R
50|$|Ames was {{serviced}} by the Fort Dodge, Des Moines and Southern Railroad via a branch from Kelley to Iowa State University and to downtown Ames. The tracks were removed in the 1960s. The Chicago and North Western Transportation Company twin mainline runs {{east and west}} bisecting the town and running {{just south of the}} downtown business district. The C&NW used to operate a branch to Des Moines. This line was removed in the 1980s when the Spine Line through Nevada was purchased from the Rock Island Railroad after its bankruptcy. The Union Pacific, successor to the C&NW, still runs 60-70 trains a day through Ames on twin mainlines, which leads to some traffic delays. There is also a branch to Eagle Grove that leaves Ames to the north. The Union Pacific maintains a small yard called Ames Yard east of Ames between Ames and Nevada. Ames has been testing automatic train horns at several of its crossings. These directional horns which are focused down the streets are activated when the crossing signals turn on and are shut off after the train crosses the crossing. This system cancels out the need for the trains to blow their <b>horns.</b> Train <b>noise</b> had been a problem in the residential areas to the west and northwest of downtown.|$|R

40|$|Tyre noise {{measuring}} {{procedures are}} used worldwide and covered by appropriate International Standards, {{but from the}} literature search and the author's 30 years' expertise in acoustics, {{it became clear that}} there are still problems to overcome. The objective of this project is to design and construct a prototype stationary acoustic device that can produce and measure the noise emitted by the grooves and treads of automotive tyres and develop a new acoustic tyre measuring procedure. Through this new procedure, the noise measurement can be performed in a controlled laboratory environment, no expensive measuring platforms are needed, the cost of the tyre developers will be kept to a minimum, different models or a portion of the tyres can be used (even before tyre production starts), the tyres can be "noise classified" by public authorities, and the procedure will be isolated from the varying surfaces, e. g. roughness and porosity of the road pavement. The constructed apparatus / device is an open platform, and by using this procedure and methodology, research and many investigations can be performed in the future, to suit each investigator's objectives, both in tyre design and in pavement design. In the second stage of the thesis, it was necessary to compare the measured noise from the developed device with an actual rolling tyre, measured according to standard procedures. So a towed one wheel trailer, installed with microphones, has been constructed and tested. Validation of the trailer's noise data has been established conducting a further literature search and has proven satisfactory. In the third stage of the thesis, the main platform of the device was used to investigate further, more tyre related acoustic phenomena.

6000|$|Mr. Dobbes was {{probably}} {{right in his}} opinion that hotels, tourists, and congregations of men are detrimental to shooting. Crummie-Toddie was in all respects suited for sport. Killancodlem, though it had {{the name of a}} shooting-place, certainly was not so. Men going there took their guns. Gamekeepers were provided and gillies,--and, in a moderate quantity, game. On certain grand days a deer or two might be shot,--and would be very much talked about afterwards. But a glance at the place would suffice to show that Killancodlem was not intended for sport. It was a fine castellated mansion, with beautiful though narrow grounds, standing in the valley of the Archay River, with a mountain behind and the river in front. Between the gates and the river there was a public road on which a stage-coach ran, with loud-blown <b>horns</b> and the <b>noise</b> of many tourists. A mile beyond the Castle was the famous Killancodlem hotel which made up a hundred and twenty beds, and at which half as many more guests would sleep on occasions under the tables. And there was the Killancodlem post-office halfway between the two. At Crummie-Toddie they had to send nine miles for their letters and newspapers. At Killancodlem there was lawn-tennis and a billiard-room and dancing every night.

5000|$|Horn {{dominated}} {{the recording of}} [...] "Relax" [...] in his effort for perfectionism. The band were overawed and intimidated by Horn's reputation, and thus were too nervous to make suggestions. Johnson said in his autobiography, [...] "Whatever he said we went along with". When attempts to record with the full band proved unsatisfactory, Horn hired former Ian Dury backing band the Blockheads for the sessions, with Norman Watt-Roy providing the original bass line. Those sessions were later deemed to be not modern sounding enough. Horn then constructed a more electronic-based version of the song with keyboards by session musician Andy Richards and with rhythm programming assistance from J. J. Jeczalik of Art of <b>Noise.</b> <b>Horn</b> developed {{this version of the}} recording in his west London studio while the band remained in their hometown of Liverpool. Horn had made 3 versions of [...] "Relax" [...] prior to Richards and guitarist Stephen Lipson joining his ZTT Production 'Theam' in late 1983. Horn left the studio late one night asking for Lipson to erase the multitrack (of version 3) due to lack of progress, but came back into the studio some time later to hear Richards playing a variety of modal chords based around the key of E minor with Lipson playing guitar along to the unerased multitrack. Ultimately lead vocalist Johnson was the only band member to perform on the record; the only contribution by the other members was a sample crafted from the sound {{of the rest of the}} band jumping into a swimming pool. Horn explained years later, [...] "I was just [...] [...] [...] Look, 'Relax' had to be a hit." [...] Despite the band's absence from the record, Horn said, [...] "I could never have done these records in isolation.

6000|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{district of}} South Devon, the greenest, most luxuriant in its vegetation, {{and perhaps the}} hottest in England, is that bit of country between the Exe and the Axe which is watered by the Clyst, the Otter, and the Sid. In any {{one of a dozen}} villages found beside these pretty little rivers a man might spend a month, a year, a lifetime, very agreeably, ceasing not to congratulate himself on the good fortune which first led him into such a garden. Yet after a week or two in this luxurious land I began to be dissatisfied with my surroundings. It was June; the weather was exceptionally dry and sultry. Vague thoughts, or [...] "visitings" [...] of mountains and moors and coasts would intrude to make the confinement of deep lanes seem increasingly irksome. Each day I wandered miles in some new direction, never knowing whither the devious path would lead me, never inquiring of any person, nor consulting map or guide, since {{to do that is to}} deprive oneself of the pleasure of discovery; always with a secret wish to find some exit as it were--some place beyond the everlasting wall of high hedges and green trees, where there would be a wide horizon and wind blowing unobstructed over leagues of open country to bring me back the sense of lost liberty. I found only fresh woods and pastures new that were like the old; other lanes leading to other farm-houses, each in its familiar pretty setting of orchard and garden; and, finally, other ancient villages, each with its ivy-grown grey church tower looking down on a green graveyard and scattered cottages, mostly mud-built and thatched with straw. Finding no outlook on any side I went back to the streams, oftenest to the Otter, where, lying by the hour on the bank, I watched the speckled trout below me and the dark-plumaged dipper with shining white breast standing solitary and curtseying on a stone in the middle of the current. Sometimes a kingfisher would flash by, and occasionally I came upon a lonely grey heron; but no mammal bigger than a watervole appeared, although I waited and watched for the much bigger beast that gives the river its name. Still it was good to know that he was there, and had his den somewhere in the steep rocky bank under the rough tangle of ivy and bramble and roots of overhanging trees. One was shot by a farmer during my stay, but my desire was for the living, not a dead otter. Consequently, when the otter-hunt came with blaze of scarlet coats and blowing of brass <b>horns</b> and <b>noise</b> of barking hounds and shouts of excited people, it had no sooner got half a mile above Ottery St. Mary, where I had joined the straggling procession, than, falling behind, the hunting fury died out of me and I was relieved to hear that no quarry had been found. The frightened moorhen stole back to her spotty eggs, the dipper returned to his dipping and curtseying to his own image in the stream, and I to my idle dreaming and watching.|$|R
5000|$|In 1857, Bebb fired {{a weapon}} {{and a man}} died. He was accused of manslaughter, and tried in Winnebago County, Illinois Circuit Court in 1858. One of his defense council {{summarized}} the case thusly: [...] In the month of May, 1857, Michael Bebb, the second son of Gov. Bebb, had married a wife and brought her home to his father's house. On {{the night of the}} 18th, a company of young men, to the number of twelve, collected cow-bells, tin <b>horns</b> and other <b>noise</b> making instruments, together with a number of guns; and about 11 o'clock opened up a , with cheers, ringing of bells, blowing of horns, rattling of pans and discharging of guns.The family of Gov. Bebb had no previous intimation of what was intended, and were very much alarmed. The Governor took a double-barrel fowling-piece in his hands and went out, and ordered the rioters off his premises. They may not have heard him, by reason of the noise they were making, being in full concert when he went out. Be that as it may, they gave no heed to the warning. He then discharged one barrel of his gun at too great a distance to do any serious execution, and again warned them to be gone. All the company except four retreated. These four made a rush toward the Governor, apparently for the purpose of seizing him. He retreated a few paces, and, turning round, shot the foremost man dead on the spot.The next morning he assembled the sheriff and other ministers of the law; showed them what was done; furnished them with the names of all the parties, so far as he had ascertained them in the meantime; and demanded an investigation. An investigation was had before the examining court, and the Governor was discharged.Some months afterward, {{when he was in the}} city of Cincinnati on business, he learned through the newspapers that the Grand Jury of Winnebago County had indicted him for manslaughter. He immediately telegraphed the sheriff of the county, informing him where he was and when he would be home. He went home, surrendered himself and gave bail for his appearance.The trial of the case was set for the 4th of February, 1858, and, in addition to the able council at home, he added the Hon. Thomas Corwin and Judge William Johnston, of Ohio, who were present, conducted the examination, and argued the case to the jury. The argument for the defense was opened by Gov. Corwin, in a speech replete with wit and eloquence. Immense numbers of people crowded to hear the trial, from various motives; chiefly to learn judicially how much an unoffending citizen might lawfully do in defense of his habituation and household when menaced by lawless assemblies.The result, it is believed, was satisfactory to all well-disposed persons. Gov. Bebb was acquitted, notwithstanding an able and learned effort on the part of the People, in which everything was done, that talent and industry could do, to secure a conviction.
