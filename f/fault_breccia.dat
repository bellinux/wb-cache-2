25|$|The Greenside {{fault is}} a normal fault with an average dip of 70° to the east. A fault plane is not a flat surface and the actual dip of the Greenside fault varies between 58° east and vertical; in one place it was 83° west. As the rock {{fractured}} and the two sides moved against each other, cavities were created, partly filled with broken rock (<b>fault</b> <b>breccia</b> and fault gouge). Hydrothermal circulation of sea water at temperatures of 110130°C, probably during the Carboniferous Period, led to mineralisation of the fault cavities. The metal content {{is believed to have}} been leached out of rocks of the Skiddaw Group, or the underlying granite batholith. The mineralisation of the fault shows some vertical zonation, with baryte (barium sulphate) in the upper part of the vein, and small amounts of both blende (sphalerite, zinc sulphide) and chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) at deeper levels.|$|E

40|$|The faults {{chosen for}} this study belong to the Iberian Chain (Northeastern Iberian Plate) and include two kinematically {{different}} kinds of structures (thrusts and strike-slip), with well-developed fault gouges several tens or hundreds of meters thick (Datos Fault System and Daroca Fault) and thinner clayey layers linked to thrust surfaces (Cameros-Demanda Thrust). The Cameros-Demanda Thrust has a relatively simple history of Mesozoic extension and Tertiary inversion. Along the thrust several areas with fault rocks include weakly oriented breccias, deformed conglomerates and clayey fault gouge with S/C structures. The Datos and Daroca faults show a more complex history of movement and are of key importance in the Variscan and Alpine evolution of the Iberian microplate.

40|$|Modeling of {{limestone}} reservoirs is traditionally developed applying tectonic fractures concepts or planar discontinuities {{and has been}} simulated dynamically without considering nonplanar discontinuities as sedimentary <b>breccias,</b> vugs, <b>fault</b> <b>breccias,</b> and impact breccias, assuming that all these nonplanar discontinuities are tectonic fractures, causing confusion and contradictions in reservoirs characterization. The differences in geometry and connectivity in each discontinuity affect fluid flow, generating the challenge to develop specific analytical models that describe quantitatively hydrodynamic behavior in breccias, vugs, and fractures, focusing on oil flow in limestone reservoirs. This paper demonstrates the differences between types of discontinuities that affect limestone reservoirs and recommends that all discontinuities {{should be included in}} simulation and static-dynamic characterization, because they impact fluid flow. To demonstrate these differences, different analytic models are developed. Findings of this work are based on observations of cores, outcrops, and tomography and are validated with field data.

40|$|Fault zone {{architecture}} and related permeability structures form primary controls on fluid flow in upper-crustal, brittle fault zones. We develop {{qualitative and quantitative}} schemes for evaluating fault-related permeability structures by using results of field investigations, laboratory permeability measurements, and numerical models of flow within and near fault zones. The qualitative scheme compares {{the percentage of the}} total fault zone width composed of fault core materials (e. g., anastomosing slip surfaces, clay-rich gouge, cataclasite, and <b>fault</b> <b>breccias)</b> to the percentage of subsidiary damage zone structures (e. g., kinematically related fracture sets, small faults, and veins). A more quantitative scheme is developed to define a set of indices that characterize fault zone {{architecture and}} spatial variability. The fault core and damage zone are distinct structural and hydrogeologic units that reflect the material properties and deformation conditions within a fault zone. Whether a fault zone will act as a conduit, barrier, or combined conduit-barrier system is controlled by the relative percentage of fault core and damage zone structures and the inherent variability in grain scale and fracture permeability.

Two other criteria necessary for recognition of seismites, i. e., the proximity to active faults and decreasing of complexity or frequency of SSDS with the increasing distance from the triggering fault are not applicable to the described succession due to Late Cretaceous tectonic movements.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} mechanisms that accommodate crystal-plastic deformation. In crustal rocks the most important processes are dislocation creep and diffusion creep. Dislocation generation acts to increase the internal energy of crystals. This effect is compensated through grain-boundary-migration recrystallization which reduces the internal energy by increasing the grain boundary area and reducing the grain volume, storing energy at the mineral grain surface. This process tends to organize dislocations into subgrain boundaries. As more dislocations are added to subgrain boundaries, the misorientation across that subgrain boundary will increase until the boundary becomes a high-angle boundary and the subgrain effectively becomes a new grain. This process, {{sometimes referred to as}} subgrain rotation recrystallization,acts to reduce the mean grain size. Volume and grain-boundary diffusion, the critical mechanisms in diffusion creep, become important at high temperatures and small grain sizes. Thus some researchers have argued that as mylonites are formed by dislocation creep and dynamic recrystallization, a transition to diffusion creep can occur once the grain size is reduced sufficiently.Mylonites generally develop in ductile shear zones where high rates of strain are focused. They are the deep crustal counterparts to cataclastic brittle faults that create <b>fault</b> <b>breccias.</b>|$|R

At the sea cliff close to the Ilha do Japonês, there is an excellent contact outcrop between them. The tectonic breccia zone is 10 to 20 m wide and has N 30 ºE direction. The breccia clasts are angular and characterized by auto-brecciation texture, and composed of breccia with similar aspect of the host tectonic breccia. The matrix is firmly consolidated by hydrothermalism and following silicification. The mafic dyke is 7 to 10 m wide and of N 45 ºE direction. Along the contact, the dyke chilled margin featured by fine-grained basalt and prismatic joints can be observed. At the Conchas Beach and Arraial do Cabo city, there are four outcrops demonstrating the mafic dyke intrusion into the consolidated tectonic breccias.
