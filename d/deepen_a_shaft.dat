50|$|Shortly {{after the}} sinking work began, the North Staffordshire Institute of Mining Engineers made {{a visit to}} the colliery, and to commemorate the {{occasion}} the Bellringer shaft was renamed the Institute. In 1874 the colliery company also started to widen and <b>deepen</b> <b>an</b> old <b>shaft,</b> originally sunk by Hugh Henshall Williamson in the 1850s and sited to the north-east of the Institute. This shaft was to act as the upcast for the Institute Pit and was named the Laura, after Mr Charles J. Homer's daughter. Both shafts were completed in 1876.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{reason for}} opening deeper mining horizon is to {{preserve}} the volume of extraction, a smooth transition to a new horizon {{with the intention of}} mining state of existing stocks. In the proposal of opening will be maintain the current direction of transport (extraction of mineral, haulage of materials, lower) through bank to the existing plant equipment. Alternative proposals for solutions of opening new horizon will be limited to the range of main opening workings (hoisting shaft), including relevant hoisting equipment and objects immediately fasten on it. Other deeper horizon equipment outside the pumping station (filling station, transformer station, depot, level gangway, etc.) will be practically independent on the horizon and will be the same essentially in all cases. The proposal will be considered three alternatives: <b>deepening</b> of <b>a</b> <b>shaft,</b> sinking blind shaft and dip road. The best alternative will be recommended {{on the basis of the}} decision-making process...|$|R

25|$|The {{weight of}} <b>an</b> arrow <b>shaft</b> can be {{expressed}} in GPI (Grains Per Inch). The length of <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> in inches multiplied by its GPI rating gives {{the weight of the}} shaft in grains. For example, <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> that is 30 inches long and has a GPI of 9.5 weighs 285 grains, or about 18 grams. This does not include the other elements of a finished arrow, so a complete arrow will be heavier than the shaft alone.|$|R

30|$|To {{decrease}} {{the variation in}} static torque in conventional Savonius rotors at a 0 ° to 360 ° rotor angle, Kamoji and Kedare[15] tested a helical rotor with a twist of 90 °. They conducted experiments in an open-jet wind tunnel at gap ratios of 0.0, 0.05, and 0.08 to study the effect of gap ratio and Reynolds number on its performance and evaluated static torque, dynamic torque, and power coefficients. They compared its performance with and without <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> between the end plates at different gap ratios. A helical rotor without <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> was also compared {{with the performance of}} the conventional Savonius rotor. They found that all helical rotors have a positive coefficient of static torque at all rotor angles, but the rotors with <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> had <b>a</b> lower power coefficient than those without. The coefficient of power of the rotor without <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> with <b>a</b> 0.0 gap ratio was marginally less than the conventional Savonius rotor.|$|R
