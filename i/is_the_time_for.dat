500|$|After Till went missing, a three-paragraph {{story was}} {{printed in the}} Greenwood Commonwealth and quickly picked up by other Mississippi newspapers. They {{reported}} on his death when the body was found. The next day, when {{a picture of him}} his mother had taken the previous Christmas showing them smiling together appeared in the Jackson Daily News and Vicksburg Evening Post, editorials and letters to the editor were printed expressing shame at the people who had caused Till's death. One read, [...] "Now <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> every citizen who loves the state of Mississippi to 'Stand up and be counted' before hoodlum white trash brings us to destruction." [...] The letter said that Negroes were not the downfall of Mississippi society, but whites like those in White Citizens' Councils that condoned violence.|$|E
500|$|On 22 April, the EFF also lodged a {{complaint}} with ICASA after the SABC banned an EFF election campaign television advert titled [...] "Now <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> economic freedom" [...] that was due to be aired on 2 occasions, 2 days before the complaint was lodged and {{on the day the}} complaint was lodged. Four days after the complaint was lodged, ICASA upheld the SABC's ban on the advert. ICASA found that wording in the advert about physically destroying contentious e-tolls in Gauteng could incite violence and therefore contravened ICASA's regulations on party election broadcasts. The EFF advert had also highlighted police brutality, using interviews and photographs related to the Marikana massacre and the same photograph of the March 2014 Bekkersdal protest that ICASA ordered removed from the DA advert.|$|E

To illustrate the point, he unveiled a mock motto for the rally: [...] "Take it down a notch for America." [...] A series of protest sign designs were proposed on the Daily Show featuring messages such as [...] "I disagree with you, but I'm pretty sure you're not Hitler." [...] Colbert responded to Stewart's proposal by challenging the theme of Stewart's rally and justifying his own [...] "March to Keep Fear Alive."

Scott Niedermayer retired as a player following the season, and the Ducks named Getzlaf his successor as team captain prior to the 2010–11 season. Ducks' head coach Randy Carlyle described {{the promotion of the}} 25-year-old in terms of Getzlaf's maturation as an NHL player. He added, [...] "We felt that with it being his sixth season in the League, now <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the transition and the veteran players agreed with us." [...] During the season, he suffered multiple nasal sinus fractures after being struck in the face by a puck, and consequently appeared in only 67 games; he recorded 19 goals. Getzlaf's 57 assists ranked fourth in the NHL and he added six points in six post-season contests, including his 50th career playoff point.|$|E
500|$|An 1837 essay of his, {{centered}} on a debate regarding the translation of Homer's works into Romanian, featured a series of counsels to younger writers: [...] "This {{is not the time}} for criticism, children, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> writing, so write as much and as good as you can, but without meanness; create, do not ruin; for the nation receives and blesses the maker and curses the destroyer. Write with a clear conscience". Paraphrased as [...] "Write anything, boys, as long as you go on writing!" [...] (Scrieţi, băieţi, orice, numai scrieţi!), this quote became the topic of derision in later decades, and was hailed as an example of Heliade's failure to distinguish between quality and quantity. The latter verdict was considered unfair by the literary historian Şerban Cioculescu and others, who argued that Ion Heliade Rădulescu's main goal was to encourage the rapid development of local literature to a European level. Although he recognized, among other things, Heliade's merits of having removed pretentious boyar discourse from poetry and having favored regular rhyme, Paul Zarifopol accused him and Gheorghe Asachi of [...] "tastelessness" [...] and [...] "literary insecurity". He elaborated: [...] "Rădulescu was arguably afflicted with this sin more than Asachi, given his unfortunate ambitions of fabricating a literary language".|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. Goebbels {{was one of the most}} enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the Reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: [...] "ow <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing." [...] In the lead-up to the Sudetenland crisis in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the Sudeten Germans while campaigning against the Czech government. Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing [...] "war panic" [...] in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity. After the western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in Danzig and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war. He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.|$|E
