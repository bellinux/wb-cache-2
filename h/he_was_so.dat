5|$|George V disliked {{sitting for}} {{portrait}}s and despised modern art; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> displeased by one portrait by Charles Sims that he ordered {{it to be}} burned. He did admire sculptor Bertram Mackennal, who created statues of George for display in Madras and Delhi, and William Reid Dick, whose statue of George V stands outside Westminster Abbey, London.|$|E
5|$|In May 1878 Gaudí {{designed}} a display cabinet for the Esteban Comella glove factory, which was {{exhibited in the}} Spanish pavilion at the Paris World Exhibition that year. It was this work that {{attracted the attention of}} the entrepreneur Eusebi Güell, visiting the French capital; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> impressed that he wanted to meet Gaudí on his return, beginning a long friendship and professional collaboration. Güell became Gaudí's main patron and sponsor of many of his large projects.|$|E

5|$|This {{incident}} and Phan's response are {{often cited as}} {{one of the reasons why}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> admired by the populace and among future generations of Vietnamese anti-colonialists: he adhered to the highest personal standards of patriotism. He identified with a countrywide cause, far removed from the questions of family and region.|$|E
5|$|When Feynman {{was nearing}} death, he asked Danny Hillis why <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> sad. Hillis {{replied that he}} thought Feynman {{was going to die}} soon. Feynman said that that {{sometimes}} bothered him, too, adding, when you get to be as old as he was, and have told so many stories to so many people, even when he was dead he would not be completely gone.|$|E
5|$|A late {{invitation}} to join Team Canada's summer camp {{in preparation for}} the 2002 Winter Olympics helped Iginla emerge as a star player. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> surprised by the invite he initially thought one of his Calgary Flames teammates was playing a prank on him. He scored two goals in the gold medal game, a 5–2 victory over the United States, as Canada won its first Olympic gold medal in 50years. With this win, Iginla became the first black man to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics. Iginla also represented Canada at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey as an alternate captain, playing on a line with Joe Sakic and Mario Lemieux. Canada won the gold medal.|$|E
60|$|I love {{to quote}} from Grimes, because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> dramatic. And because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> romantic. And because {{he seems to}} care but little whether he tells the truth or not, so he scares the reader or excites his envy or his admiration.|$|R

5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E
5|$|After this defeat, Wetherby {{moved to}} Franklin County and secured a {{position}} at Brighton Engineering with help from his old primary opponent, Bill May. From 1964 to 1966, he was a delegate to an assembly charged with revising the state constitution. In 1965, May backed Wetherby in his campaign for the Kentucky Senate. He won the election, defeating the candidate favored by Chandler, and was chosen president of that body from 1966 to 1968. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> effective in this position that the state's 1966 budget was debated for only ten days before passing {{by a vote of}} 31–5 in virtually the same form as it was presented.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but only because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> confident of his control and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E

5|$|At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also {{received}} photographic instruction from Rossier. Apparently Ueno had {{originally intended to}} learn not only the practice of photography but also the manufacture of cameras. The encounter with Rossier seems to have convinced Ueno to pursue photography as a career, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> overwhelmed by the technology of the camera that he quickly dropped the notion of making one himself. Within a few months, he and Horie had purchased a French camera and chemicals, thereafter launching their independent photographic careers.|$|E
5|$|Barbara Ketcham Wheaton and Stephen Mennell {{provided}} the definitive arguments against these claims. They {{point out that}} Catherine’s father-in-law, King Francis I, and the flower of the French aristocracy had dined at some of Italy’s most élite tables during the king’s Italian campaigns (and that an earlier generation had done so during King Charles VIII’s invasion of 1494); that a vast Italian entourage had visited France for the wedding of Catherine de’ Medici’s father to her French-born mother; {{and that she had}} little influence at court until her husband’s death because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> besotted by his mistress, Diane de Poitiers. In fact, a large population of Italians—bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci—had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning Renaissance. Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine.|$|E
5|$|Completing {{his studies}} in 1793, Rowan moved to Lexington, Kentucky and read law under former Kentucky Attorney General George Nicholas. He was {{admitted}} to the bar in May 1795 and commenced practice in Louisville. Rowan struggled financially during his early years as a lawyer. Nelson County judge Atkinson Hill took an interest in Rowan, furnishing him with money to expand his law library and taking him as a business partner. In order to earn some money, Rowan accepted an appointment as a public prosecutor, but after securing a felony conviction against a young man in his first case, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> troubled that he resigned the office and resolved never again {{to play the role of}} prosecutor. For the remainder of his career, he always represented defendants. An advocate of education, Rowan allowed several prominent young law students to study in his office, including future U.S. Treasury Secretary James Guthrie, future Supreme Court Justice John McKinley, and future Kentucky Governor Lazarus W. Powell.|$|E

5|$|Curie's {{systematic}} studies {{included two}} uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite). Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was {{four times as}} active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium. She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. Pierre was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> invested in it {{that he decided to}} drop his work on crystals and to join her.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa's {{government}} would face {{an economic crisis}} and the 2001 riots, resigning two years later. De la Rúa thought that Duhalde had organized a coup d'état against him Rodolfo Terragno, De la Rúa's Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, thought instead that the crisis was the exclusive result of keeping the peso-dollar parity despite the costs generated by it. Duhalde and other Peronists interviewed by Ceferino Reato for the book Doce noches said that the party {{had no interest in}} removing De la Rúa from power, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> unpopular that the party would win the 2003 presidential elections without a problem.|$|E

Denning was born two months earlier than {{expected}} and almost died at birth; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> small and weak that he was nicknamed 'Tom Thumb' and could fit in a pint pot. He was named after Alfred the Great by his sister Marjorie, and was baptised on 23 April 1899 at All Hallows Church, Whitchurch.|$|E

5|$|During the 1932–33 season Gardiner {{began to}} develop a tonsil {{infection}} that drained his strength. While he initially kept the infection private, Gardiner made his condition public on December 23, 1932. Even though he was ill, Gardiner played the next night in Toronto. Though his fifty-five saves were the deciding factor in the Black Hawks win and his performance was so good that both league President Frank Calder and Maple Leafs star forward Charlie Conacher praised him, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> sick he would collapse on the dressing room floor in between periods with a fever of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; after the game Gardiner was rushed to a local hospital. This was the first notable symptom of Gardiner's health issues.|$|E
5|$|For {{the winter}} of 356/7, he chose Senones (Sens) near Paris as his own {{wintering}} base, but quartered most of his troops in other towns, including the main body at Reims under Marcellus, to spread the burden. A large band of Alamanni heard of his reduced escort, however, and besieged him at Sens. Julian's forces were able to hold out until, after a month, the Germans withdrew. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> outnumbered by the enemy, however, that {{he was unable to}} sally forth and give chase. During the siege, Marcellus had failed to come to his assistance. For this omission, denounced as cowardice by Ammianus, Marcellus was dismissed as magister equitum by Constantius and replaced by Severus, a distinguished officer who was more compatible with Julian.|$|E
5|$|Governors who had {{previously}} been legislators have generally had greater success in achieving their legislative goals while governor. Three speakers of the house have become governor. Governor Joseph A. Wright had the worst relations of any governor with the assembly. He twice delivered speeches to a joint session where he harangued them for what he perceived to be corruption, accusing them of taking bribes from the Bank of Indiana. The legislature responded by overriding all his anti-banking vetoes. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> disliked by his own party that he was expelled from it after his term.|$|E
