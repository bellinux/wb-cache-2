40|$|The need of {{determining}} “free” chloride {{content in the}} aqueous phase of hardened cementitious materials arises {{from the fact that}} chloride is the responsible agent of the depassivation of the rebars in reinforced concrete. This paper presents a method of obtaining free chlorides by leaching in an alkaline solution during 24 h. The method is calibrated by comparison with the values obtained by means of the pore-pressing technique (PPT). The agreement found is reasonably good in spite of the risk of excessive leaching that aims to solve part of bound chlorides. The use of <b>decarbonated</b> <b>water</b> as extraction agent has resulted appropriately, perhaps {{due to the fact that}} the samples are not powdered, instead, pieces of around 2 mm in size are used.

40|$|Abstract [...] Rehydration {{is shown}} to be {{straightforward}} for the reconstruction f polyoxometallate-pillared layered double hydroxides. Zn-A 1 hydrotalcite-like minerals were prepared with Zn/A 1 ratios of 1 to 5 by coprecipitation atpH 7. Good crystallinity was obtained for samples with Zn/Al ratios above 2. Thermal decomposition was achieved by calcining the samples at 300 to 900 ~ The calcined samples were exposed to <b>decarbonated</b> <b>water,</b> with or without hydrothermal treatment to evaluate reconstruction f the hydrotalcite-like minerals by rehydration. Restoration of the hydrotalcite-like structure {{was found to be}} independent of the Zn/A 1 ratios for samples calcined between 300 and 400 ~ however, a second phase, aluminum hydroxide or zinc oxide, was generally detected. A spinel phase, formed during the calcination of samples at temperatures above 600 ~ inhibited reconstruction of the hydrotalcite-like phase. The rehydrated hydrotalcite-like minerals had Zn/A 1 ratios close to 2, irrespective of the chemistry of the starting material...|$|E
