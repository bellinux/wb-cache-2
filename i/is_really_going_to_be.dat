[...] "When we did Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, we didn't fit in," [...] he said. [...] "There was a little less screaming and a little more melody, but it was still us. Never was it a case of, 'Don't put that melody there because Hardcore Chuck, who took me to my first show at Fairfield American Legion Hall, <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bummed at me.' I don’t give a shit: If I had to work at McDonald's {{for the rest of my}} life to play shows and ride in a shitty van on tour? I've done it. I'll do it again." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{room was}} steady enough now, {{but she had}} lost the preternatural acuteness of her senses, and felt confused. She heard Barbara say: [...] "I can {{take you to the}} door in my cab," [...] and murmuring: [...] "I will get ready," [...] went into her bedroom. For a moment she was so utterly bewildered that she did nothing. Then every other thought was lost in a strange, soft, almost painful delight, as if some new {{instinct}} were being born in her; and quickly, but without confusion or hurry, she began packing. She put into a valise her own toilet things; then flannel, cotton-wool, eau de Cologne, hot-water bottle, Etna, shawls, thermometer, everything she had which could serve in illness. Changing to a plain dress, she took up the valise and returned to Barbara. They went out together to the cab. The moment it began to bear her to this ordeal at once so longed-for and so terrible, fear came over her again, so that she screwed herself into the corner, very white and still. She was aware of Barbara calling to the driver: [...] "Go by the Strand, and stop at a poulterer's for ice!" [...] And, when the bag of ice had been handed in, heard her saying: [...] "I will bring you all you want--if he <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ill." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kill Your Stereo's {{review of}} the album was also positive, {{awarding}} the album a score of 85/100.

Shakira declined his offer, citing personal issues, but stated {{that she would be}} open to a collaboration with him in the future, but [...] "not now". Pitbull then sent the verse he offered to Shakira song to Ne-Yo, who recorded it and [...] "knocks it out of the park". Pitbull then reached out to Shakira once again, stating that: [...] "I think this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a monster, I would love for you {{to be a part of}} it, if not cool". She declined the second verse offered to her, and it went to Nayer.|$|E

5000|$|The first album, 1980's The Return of the Durutti Column (title {{inspired}} by a 1967 Situationist International poster that includes that phrase), was produced by Martin Hannett. Reilly: [...] "...he more or less got sounds for me {{that no one else}} could understand that I wanted. And he understood that I wanted to play the electric guitar but I didn't want this horrible distorted, usual electric guitar sound and he managed to get that." [...] The record featured a sandpaper sleeve (like the title of the record, {{inspired by}} a Situationist joke, a book - Guy Debord's Mémoires - with a sandpaper cover to destroy other books on the shelf). [...] "I didn't even know {{it was going to be}} an album. It was just the case of jumping at the chance of being in the studio. I actually didn't get up in time, Martin had to physically get me out of bed to get me to the studio - that's how little I believed it would happen. I was still doing late night petrol station shifts. I was even more amazed when Tony presented me with a white label. I was completely baffled. 'What, this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an album? You must be insane! No-one's going to buy this!' And then Tony got the idea from the Situationists about the sandpaper book, and decided to do some with a sandpaper sleeve. It was Joy Division that stuck the sandpaper onto the card. I was mortified." ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter raises {{issues about}} welfare-to-work {{policies}} {{and how they}} are currently evaluated. It first explores the influence of the 2008 / 09 recession in terms of different groups in the labour market and social cohesion. The chapter then questions the conditional welfare and the ‘work first’ policy. After this, it considers the wider outcomes and how a more holistic approach to evaluation could be developed. Problems were already emerging before the 2008 / 09 recession really started to bite in terms of unemployment. During the 2008 / 09 recession, it became more difficult to justify the lack of focus on the demand side. An alternative approach to policy and frameworks for evaluation is described. It has been argued that, if long-term unemployment <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reduced, the focus on the supply side is insufficient and must be combined with an increased focus on the demand side...|$|E
40|$|Password-free login is {{a system}} that sets the user free from remembering the {{passwords}} used, so that the user can get an easy access to any website of his choice in a common password. The system is basically a password storage website that keeps all the login id’s and password in a single database. The advantage of the system is that even if in mere future the user happens to forget the login of a website that has been accessed a long time back, it can be easily retrieved by the user using the common login id details for the website. Thus, this website will set the user free from remembering the login details of any website. The details of the work done can be seen in detail in the further part of the paper. So, this website will set the user free by making him remember just a single login id and password which in turn will retrieve the required login id and its password. This system <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a boon for the all kinds of users. The paper also discusses the security aspects of the website so that the system can be proved to be a robust and concrete one. The uniqueness of the system {{can be seen in the}} further detailed discussion...|$|E

40|$|Ill-health {{can have}} a huge effect on the income of a family, writes Robert Tanton for APO MANY AUSTRALIANS in the {{workforce}} have access to paid sick leave. In fact, unless you are a casual employee, or not in the labour force, access to sick leave is probably part of your working conditions. And many of us, if asked, would say we are healthy – in 2007, 84 per cent {{of men and women}} of working age, when asked this question, responded that they had good to excellent health. But what of the 16 per cent who responded that they experienced poor health? Did they have access to sick leave? Did they experience lower incomes? Recent research by Binod Nepal, Alicia Payne and Laurie Brown at the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra, published in the AMP. NATSEM report Healthy, Wealthy and Wise?, suggests that people aged 25 – 64 who are in poor health are more likely not to be working, and therefore had lower incomes than people with good health. This effect was seen for every age group, and for both men and women. One of the strongest results was that 93 per cent of men aged 35 – 54 in good health were in the labour force; whereas only 59 per cent of men aged 35 – 54 in poor health were in the labour force. This is the age group where people are usually earning the greatest (see the AMP. NATSEM report She Works Hard for Her Money for average annual earnings by age group and gender). Among those 59 per cent in the labour force but in poor health, average income in 2007 was $ 602 per week, compared to $ 1060 per week for men in good health. Now, remembering that women earn significantly less than men at this age, due to family commitments, working part time, and taking career breaks (again, see She Works Hard for Her Money), we can see that a family with a male in poor health <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> struggling. Further, in the case we have been looking at, the male is still in the labour force. In fact, 43 per cent of men with poor health rely on government benefits, so their income may well be less than if they were working. Obviously the scenario we paint above is a bleak picture, and in fact a family may adjust to a family member in poor health by others taking more of the income-earning load. But the fact is that there are families in our community struggling due to ill health, and the problems associated with earning an income when poor health means a reduced capacity to work full time. The message from this report is that ill-health {{can have a}} huge effect on the income of a family, mainly through the capacity of an individual in the family to work. These implications can be long term, depending on when the person becomes ill. If they suffer long term illness when aged 35 – 54, lifetime earnings will be lower, and superannuation will be lower. Further, if it is the primary income earner in a family who becomes sick, then the carer is already earning less working part time or is out of the labour force, so the family is hit with a double blow. The other message from this report is that maintaining good health is, and should be, an important goal of individuals and government’s. It provides a foundation for strong employment and earnings growth, and hence a strong economy. • Robert Tanton is Principal Research Fellow at the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM) Photo: iStockphoto. co...|$|E
