5|$|Partners in Time {{features}} both original {{characters and}} those that were introduced before the game. Professor E. Gadd provides the player with advice throughout the game, while Toadsworth teaches the player new moves and skills to progress through the adventure. Although the older Peach is kidnapped, Baby Peach is retrieved from the past into the present by Toadsworth, where she is nurtured by both the old and young renditions of him. Baby Bowser appeared {{near the beginning of}} the game in the past to kidnap Baby Peach, although his plans were halted by an encounter with the Mario brothers and a subsequent attack from the Shroobs. Baby Bowser harasses the quartet frequently during their journey by stealing their Cobalt Star shards, and later attacking the group with <b>his</b> <b>older</b> <b>self.</b> Kamek the Magikoopa, Petey Piranha and Fawful, an antagonist from Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, appear in the game as well.|$|E
500|$|Kirk is {{promoted}} to Captain and given command of Enterprise while Pike {{is promoted}} to Rear Admiral. Spock encounters <b>his</b> <b>older</b> <b>self,</b> who persuades his younger self to continue serving in Starfleet, encouraging him to do, for once, what feels right {{instead of what}} is logical. Spock remains in Starfleet, becoming first officer under Kirk's command. Enterprise goes to warp as the elder Spock speaks the [...] "where no one has gone before" [...] monologue.|$|E
500|$|Two {{hundred years}} have passed for the Doctor since the events of [...] "The God Complex", taking him to the age <b>his</b> <b>older</b> <b>self</b> was in [...] "The Impossible Astronaut". He spent this time [...] "waving through time" [...] at Amy and Rory, which is seen at the {{beginning}} of [...] "The Impossible Astronaut". The Doctor takes the blue envelopes he uses to summon his companions from Craig's flat and Craig gives him the Stetson he wears at the start of [...] "The Impossible Astronaut". From River Song's perspective, the final scene takes place immediately before the picnic in [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", and she is confirmed to have been that episode's eponymous astronaut.|$|E
60|$|Her words fell {{sharp and}} clear upon the still air. A tremor passed through his whole frame, {{and the light}} of a sudden {{understanding}} flashed across his face. He was <b>his</b> <b>old</b> <b>self</b> again, and more than <b>his</b> <b>old</b> <b>self.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Scene 7: The {{seashore}} In which Pinocchio becomes <b>his</b> <b>old</b> <b>self</b> {{again and}} is swallowed {{by a big}} fish.|$|R

500|$|The {{show was}} punctuated by fantasy {{sequences}} {{in which his}} character performed his thoughts as a stand-up routine in a small club. In the commentary and the interview on the DVD, Bathurst says that {{he was told that}} they would be re-shot after filming everything else, an idea abandoned because of the expense. He has an idea of re-filming the sequences 'now', as <b>his</b> <b>older</b> <b>self,</b> to give them a more retrospective feeling. He has also said that he believes Mark was too [...] "designery" [...] and wishes that he had [...] "roughened him up a bit". The role is his favourite of his whole career; he has described it as [...] "the most enjoyable job I will ever do" [...] and considers several episodes of the series to be [...] "timeless, beautifully constructed farces which will endure". Bathurst is often recognised for his appearance in this series, mentioning that [...] "Drunks stop me on public transport and tell me details of the plot of their favourite episode". As punishment for arriving late for the series one press launch at the Café Royal in Regent Street, London, writer Steven Moffat pledged to write an episode in which Mark is naked throughout. To a large extent, this vow is realised in the second series.|$|E
2500|$|The film also {{features}} Jacob Kogan in several scenes depicting Spock's childhood, including his abuse {{at the hands}} of other Vulcan children due to his half-Human heritage, and his relationship with his parents (Ben Cross and Winona Ryder). The film also depicts Kirk and Spock's initial clashes at Starfleet Academy, and the gradual development of their friendship based on shared mutual respect, what the elder Spock calls [...] "... a friendship that will define them both in ways they cannot yet realize." [...] A major change in characterization from the primary timeline is alternate Spock's involvement with alternate Uhura (Zoe Saldana), his former student. At the end of the film, the young Spock opts to remain in Starfleet while <b>his</b> <b>older</b> <b>self</b> stays in the altered universe to aid the few surviving Vulcan refugees, as Nero had destroyed Vulcan, Spock's home planet.|$|E
5000|$|Later, the younger, time-displaced Bobby {{is forced}} to confront being gay by his teammate, Jean, who privately asks him why he calls women [...] "hot", when she knows via her psychic {{abilities}} that he is gay. This causes the younger Bobby to speculate as to the complicated identity issues faced by <b>his</b> <b>older</b> <b>self</b> and the decisions <b>his</b> <b>older</b> <b>self</b> may have made in the time between them. Together with the young Jean, the young Bobby confronts <b>his</b> <b>older</b> <b>self,</b> who admits to being gay, having 'concealed' that part of himself {{so that he could}} have avoid being prejudiced against for another part of himself.|$|E

His efforts to help Shizuka do more hurt to himself, but this makes Shizuka feel {{that she has to}} accompany Nobita saying [...] "yes" [...] before collapsing from cold she contracted from her earlier conversation with Nobita. Forcing himself to remember the moment, the two are rescued by Nobita's older self who recalled the memory. Nobita learns from <b>his</b> <b>older</b> <b>self</b> that Shizuka was answering to the latter's proposition to marry her which means that the two will indeed marry. After hearing that Shizuka's father has also accepted his daughter's spouse, Nobita and Doraemon return to the present timeline.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the final}} chapter, Winterset, a young man, {{now living in}} the [...] "true" [...] twentieth century history, enters the Colonial Service {{though it is a}} doomed {{institution}} with the Empire's colonies being ceeded to new independent nations in Africa. He meets <b>his</b> <b>older</b> <b>self</b> in 1956 in Africa and learns of the truth of time-travel.

However, Supa Mega Tippy betrays him, and to get back at him, Slightly Younger Tiny Tippy rigged the Robo-Pants system. This is what caused the Ice Age.
