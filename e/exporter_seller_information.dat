40|$|The {{first three}} essays examine whether {{strategic}} precommitment to advertising investment by an established firm can prevent a new firm from entering a homogeneous-product market under various assumptions. In Essay 1, I consider the question {{under the assumption}} that (1) advertisements contain product and <b>seller</b> <b>information,</b> and (2) firms compete in prices or quantities after sequentially advertising. I show that when firms compete in prices after advertising, an incumbent can not prevent entry through advertising. When firms do in quantities, an incumbent can optimally by underinvesting in advertising. This finding implies that an incumbent 2 ̆ 7 s ability to deter entry through this type of advertisements is sensitive to whether firms compete in prices or quantities. In Essay 2, 1 handle the question {{under the assumption that}} (1) advertisements contain product and <b>seller</b> <b>information</b> and influence consumer evaluation of products, and (2) firms set a price after sequentially advertising. Unlike my prediction in Essay 1, I demonstrate that an incumbent can optimally impede entry by investing more in advertising than when it is a monopolist. This suggests that the presence of consumer persuasion through advertising seems critical to whether overinvestment in advertising can optimally deter entry. In Essay 3, I investigate the question under the assumption that (1 a) advertisements contain product and <b>seller</b> <b>information,</b> (1 b) the relative exposure frequencies to competing advertisements influence consumer evaluation of brands, and (2) firms compete in prices after sequentially advertising. In such an environment, I show that optimal entry deterrence involves excessive, repetitive advertisements by an incumbent. Therefore, repetitively informing consumers of the same information can be justified as a reasonable economic decision by a firm. Essay 4 examines the strategic choice of advertising content by firms. I focus on a case where duopolists simultaneously choose negative or positive advertising and an advertising level in a market for vertically and horizontally differentiated products. Unlike the previous result that when price is exogenous, the firm selling a relatively high-quality product runs positive advertisements, and the firm selling a relatively low-quality product runs negative advertisements, I show that when price is endogenous, both firms may engage in negative advertising. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the holdup problem that arises when the investing party must purchase a necessary input from a second party. Consistent with many real-world settings, we suppose that the investing party must sink its investment prior to purchasing the necessary input, but before contracting with the seller of this input (e. g., a firm that contracts for necessary distribution access only after developing its new product). We study how the result-ing holdup problem {{is affected by the}} <b>seller’s</b> <b>information</b> about the investing party’s likely returns from its investment.

The effort of this research is to address those problems via proposing best fit effective maintenance management system in order to overcome prevailing issues in refinery tank farm and bring the CPC to a profitable way. This research was based on Mix method approach which consists of quantitative and qualitative methods. In the first phase of this research, it was carried out wide data survey and questionnaire data collection in order to find out prevailing maintenance management issues and barriers within refinery tank farm.

50|$|Businesses or {{fractional}} {{interests in}} businesses may be valued for various purposes such as mergers and acquisitions, sale of securities, and taxable events. An accurate valuation of privately owned companies largely {{depends on the}} reliability of the firm's historic financial information. Public company financial statements are audited by Certified Public Accountants (USA), Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) or Chartered Accountants (UK and Canada) and overseen by a government regulator. Alternatively, private firms do not have government oversight—unless operating in a regulated industry—and are usually not required to have their financial statements audited. Moreover, managers of private firms often prepare their financial statements to minimize profits and, therefore, taxes. Alternatively, managers of public firms tend to want higher profits to increase their stock price. Therefore, a firm's historic financial information may not be accurate and can lead to over- and undervaluation.

40|$|Information {{about a new}} or non-frequently {{purchased}} {{product is}} often produced by {{both sides of the}} market. We construct a monopoly pricing model consisting of both <b>seller’s</b> <b>information</b> disclosure and consumer’s information acquisition. The presence of consumer search, which lowers the probability of making sales, creates incentive for the monopolist to deter search. In contrast with most previous literature, we show that, partial information disclosure arises in equilibrium when the search cost is low. As the search cost increases to medium level, the monopolist hides information but lowers the price to prevent consumers from searching. When the search cost is very high, the monopolist charges high price and hides information. The equilibrium price is thus non-monotonic in search cost. Information disclosure and consumer search co-exist only when the search cost is low, and thus complement each other. We show that transparency policies on advertising cannot improve social welfare. Nevertheless, they benefit consumers {{in a wide range of}} values of the search costs by improving matching quality and reducing the expense of searching. But for some medium levels of search costs, transparency policies hurt consumers due to the induced high price in equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Our paper {{presents}} {{a model that}} has been elaborated to synthesize the first results of a field study. The study is led at the Marseilles wholesale fruits and vegetables wholesale market, which {{represents one of the}} main hubs of supply for retailers. All transactions take place through one-to-one interactions between retailers and whole <b>sellers.</b> <b>Information</b> about prices and quantities can be acquired through interactions linked to transactions, as well as from relations with other retailers or friendly wholesale sellers. Being regularly on the market, each participant has a set of regular relations that enables them to have either regular and trustful interactions or to choose a typically market-oriented search of their products. The time each retailer has on the market is very important to determine its attitude, its ability to reproduce its network, either as a calculative attitude or just to add pleasure to its work. In this paper, the model enables us to stress the importance of the use of time for two populations of retailers: faithful ones and selfish ones. The impact on diffusion is evaluated in relation to shortages and destructions of goods that indicate a bad circulation of information in the market.

40|$|Summary. We {{consider}} amonopolist selling {{durable goods}} to consumers with unit demands but different preferences for quality. The seller can offer items of different quality {{at the same}} time to induce buyers to self-select, as in Mussa-Rosen (1978), but is not artificially constrained to offer only one such menu. Instead the seller can offer without precommitment a sequence of menus over time. In the two-buyer case where the <b>seller</b> has complete <b>information</b> about each buyer's marginal valuation for quality, the seller's profits exceed what can be obtained from a single menu and sometimes approximate the profits of a perfectly discriminating monopolist. In companion papers (Bagnoli et al., 1990, 1992), we show that these conclusions continue to hold (1) in the infinite-horizon case with any finite number of buyers and (2) in two-period examples where the <b>seller</b> has incomplete <b>information</b> about buyer preferences. 1...|$|R
