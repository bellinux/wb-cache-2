40|$|Objectives: The wear of the <b>implant</b> <b>attachment</b> {{system is}} a success factor for OVDs. This study evaluates the {{correlation}} between implant angle and wear of an overdenture attachment system supported by two implants. The research {{is based on the}} creation of a reproducible and standardised system that permits a three-dimensional analysis {{of the relationship between the}} position of the two implants and the wear of the attachment. Methods: The <b>implant</b> <b>attachment</b> system, provided by Keystone Dental® and Rhein 83 ®, is represented by simulated implants positioned in 26 models of different angular combinations, connected to simulated prostheses by two ball attachments. Processes of prosthesis insertion and removal by a patient throughout the period of one year are simulated in the lab. During this study, 1460 cycles (4 manoeuvres per day for one year) of insertion/removal will be carried out manually on the models. An Instron® linear force dynamometer is used to evaluate the variation in retention of the <b>implant</b> <b>attachment</b> system. The data is validated by ANOVA statistical analysis. Results: At this point in the study, six of the eight planned periodical measurements have been taken after the completion of 995 from 1460 extractions. In most cases, there is a reduction in retention with continued usage, however the pattern of this reduction varies. In some cases, there is a steady, decline in retention force. In other cases the retention force drops steeply during the first 135 - 260 insertions before stabilising. Certain models showed a significant lack of consistency between tests. The retention forces measured during the first test prior to the usage simulation varied from 47. 0 N to 11. 1 N and after 995 extractions had dropped to between 14. 4 N and 2. 3 N. Conclusions: The preliminary results agree with the literature. The results indicate that parallel inserts show a more consistent behaviour over time...|$|E

While resonance frequency has been previously shown to correlate with implant stability in dental implants placed in the mandible and maxilla, this tool has not been evaluated with implants placed in the medullary canal of long bones. In an in vitro model used to simulate irregular medullary canal implant contact and osseointegration, a strong positive correlation was determined between resonance frequency implant stability quo-tient values and the force required for implant pushout.

40|$|Statement of Problem: Several {{dilemmas}} {{have been}} reported {{with regard to the}} retention and longevity of implant-retained overdentures. A few studies have investigated the influence of <b>implant</b> and <b>attachment</b> inclination on the path of insertion and withdrawal of the prosthesis and on the retention and longevity of the overdenture. However, no study has been reported with regard to the influence of labio-lingual inclination on the aforementioned indices. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the influence of <b>implants</b> and <b>attachments</b> with 5 and 10 degrees of inclination on the retention and longevity of implant-retained overdentures. Materials and Method: In this experimental study, 10 <b>implants</b> and 50 <b>attachments</b> were selected and divided into five groups: Group I: two <b>implants</b> and <b>attachments</b> parallel to each other; Group II: implants inclined at an angle of 5 degrees and attachments without any inclination; Group III: <b>implants</b> and <b>attachments</b> inclined at an angle of 5 degrees; Group IV: implants inclined at an angle of 10 degrees and attachments without any inclination; Group V: <b>implants</b> and <b>attachments</b> inclined at an angle of 10 degrees. All the <b>attachments</b> and <b>implants</b> were lubricated by artificial saliva. Initial retention (N) of blocks was measured through the Universal Testing Machine (SANTAM, STM- 20). The blocks were removed and replaced for 3000 cycles and retention was measured after each 500 cycles. The retention was measured five times for each group and the registered data were analyzed by One-way ANOVA and T-test. Results: The maximum and minimum amounts of initial retention were 5. 54 ± 0. 3 and 3. 88 ±o. 19 and were related to groups III and I, respectively. There was no significant difference among groups II, III, IV, and V with regard to the amount of retention of <b>implants</b> and <b>attachments</b> (p < 0. 3). However, there was a significant difference between the control group, group I, and the other groups (p < 0. 01). Conclusion: Although the placement of labially inclined implants results in an increase in the initial retention, it will lead to a large decrease in the amount of retention after the last cycle. However, this amount of inclination (5 or 10 degrees) does not have any negative effect on the prosthesis longevity...|$|R
40|$|Total hip {{replacement}} {{is considered to}} be a highly successful and routine surgery; however, the internal components produce particles through friction and wear in the device. These particles are identified as one of the main reasons for total hip revisions. The generated, biologically active, particles provoke the formation of osteolytic areas through the inhibition of bone formation and increased fluid production. The resulting bone loss can be managed through the use of allograft bone in combination with bone chips and cement. In addition, implants constructed with highly porous trabecular metal can be used to further facilitate rapid and extensive tissue infiltration resulting in strong <b>implant</b> <b>attachment.</b> In this case study we show the use of a tibial allograft coupled with bone chips and cement to cover and support a lytic cyst in the proximal femur, distal to the greater trochanter.

Implant cumulative survival rate, marginal bone resorption, probing depth, peri-implant inflammation, bleeding, plaque, calculus, and complications were evaluated on 24 patients who were treated with implants in conjunction with removable partial denture and have used them for at least 1 year (ISCRPD: n= 12; IARPD: n= 12). There was no failed implant and all implants were functioning without clinical mobility. Marginal bone loss of ISCRPD (1. 44 ± 0. 57 [*]mm) was significantly lower than that of IARPD (p 0. 05), while the calculus was significantly more observed in ISCRPD group than in IARPD group (p< 0. 05). The retention loss of IARPD was the most common complication. Within the limits of the present study, it was found that well-planned ISBRPD was clinically appropriate.

40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{the influence of the}} type of prosthetic abutment associated to different implant connection on bone biomechanical behavior of immediately and delayed loaded implants. Computed tomography-based finite element models comprising a mandible with a single molar implant were created with different types of prosthetic abutment (UCLA or conical), implant connection (external hexagon, EH or internal hexagon, IH), and occlusal loading (axial or oblique), for both immediately and delayed loaded implants. Analysis of variance at 95 %CI was used {{to evaluate the}} peak maximum principal stress and strain in bone after applying a 100 N occlusal load.

40|$|Surgical {{instrumentation}} for {{the correction}} of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) {{is a complex}} procedure involving many difficult decisions (i. e. spinal segment to instrument, type/location/number of hooks or screws, rod diameter/length/shape, <b>implant</b> <b>attachment</b> order, amount of rod rotation, etc.). Recent advances in instrumentation technology have brought a large {{increase in the number}} of options. Despite numerous clinical publications, there is still no consensus on the optimal surgical plan for each curve type. The objective of this study was to document and analyse instrumentation configuration and strategy variability. Five females (12 – 19  years) with AIS and an indication for posterior surgical instrumentation and fusion were selected. Curve patterns were as follows: two right thoracic (Cobb: 34 °, 52 °), two right thoracic and left lumbar (Cobb T/L: 57 °/ 45 °, 72 °/ 70 °) and 1 left thoraco-lumbar (Cobb: 64 °). The pre-operative standing postero-anterior and lateral radiographs, supine side bending radiographs, a three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction of the spine, pertinent 3 D measurements as well as clinical information such as age and gender of each patient were submitted to six experienced independent spinal deformity surgeons, who were asked to provide their preferred surgical planning using a posterior spinal approach. The following data were recorded using the graphical user interface of a spine surgery simulator (6 × 5 cases) : implant types, vertebral level, position and 3 D orientation of implants, anterior release levels, rod diameter and shape, attachment sequence, rod rotation (angle, direction), adjustments (screw rotation, contraction/distraction), etc. Overall, the number of implants used ranged from 11 to 26 per patient (average 16; SD ± 4). Of these, 45 % were mono-axial screws, 31 % multi-axial screws and 24 % hooks. At one extremity of the spectrum, one surgeon used only mono-axial screws, while at the other, another surgeon used 81 % hooks. The selected superior- and inferior-instrumented vertebrae varied up to six and five levels, respectively (STD 1. 2 and 1. 5). A top-to-bottom attachment sequence was selected in 61 % of the cases, a bottom-up in 29 % and an alternate order in 11 %. The rod rotation maneuver of the first rod varied from 0 ° (no rotation) to 140 °, with a median at 90 °. In conclusion, a large variability of instrumentation strategy in AIS was documented within a small experienced group of spinal deformity surgeons. The exact cause of this large variability is unclear but warrants further investigation with multicenter outcome studies as well as experimental and computer simulation studies. We hypothesize that this variability may be attributed to different objectives for correction, to surgeon’s personal preferences based on their previous experience, to the known inter-observer variability of current classification systems and to the current lack of clearly defined strategies or rational rules based on the validated biomechanical studies with modern multi-segmental instrumentation systems...|$|E

Ten patients (Group A) {{were treated with}} overdentures supported by two narrow (3. 3 -mm diameter) implants (Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland) and ten patients (Group B) were treated with overdentures supported by three narrow implants. Locator (Zest Anchors, USA) attachments were used for prosthetic anchorage. Standardized clinical and radiographic parameters (survival rate, plaque index, calculus index, gingival index, bleeding index, probing depth and marginal bone loss) were evaluated {{at the time of}} the completion of the prosthetic treatment (baseline) and after 6, 12 and 24 months of functional loading. Prosthodontic maintenance requirements were also scored. Results. Only one implant was lost (Group B) during the healing period. There were no significant differences with regards to any of the studied clinical and radiographic parameters between the two groups (> 0. 05). Few prosthetic complications were recorded.

25|$|In the past, spherical nonporous {{implants}} {{were placed}} in the intraconal space and the extraocular muscles were either left unattached or were tied over the implant. Wrapping these <b>implants</b> allows <b>attachment</b> of the muscles to the covering material, a technique that seems to improve implant movement and reduce the incidence of implant migration. Porous implants may be saturated with antibiotic solution before insertion. Because the brittle nature of hydroxyapatite prevents direct suturing of the muscles to the implant, these implants are usually covered with some form of wrapping material. The muscles are attached to the implant in a technique similar to that used for spherical non-porous implants. The muscles may be directly sutured to porous polyethylene implants either by passing the suture through the implant material or by using an implant with fabricated suture tunnels. Some surgeons also wrap porous polyethylene implants either to facilitate muscle attachment or {{to reduce the risk of}} implant exposure. A variety of wrapping materials have been used to cover porous implants, including polyglactin or polyglycolic acid mesh, heterologous tissue (bovine pericardium), homologous donor tissue (sclera, dermis), and autogenous tissue (fascia lata, temporalis fascia, posterior auricular muscle, rectus abdominis sheath).|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} stress patterns generated within implant-supported mandibular overdentures retained by two different attachment types: {{ball and socket}} and locator attachments. Materials and methods: Commercial CAD/CAM and finite element analysis software packages were utilized to construct two 3 D finite element models for the two attachment types. Unilateral masticatory compressive loads of 50, 100, and 150  N were applied vertically to the overdentures, parallel to the longitudinal axes of the implants. Loads were directed toward the central fossa in the molar region of each overdenture, that linear static analysis was carried out to find the generated stresses and deformation on {{each part of the}} studied model. Results: According to FEA results the ball attachment neck is highly stressed in comparison to the locator one.

40|$|AIM: This study {{aimed to}} compare the {{stresses}} generated by using two or four root form dental implants supporting mandibular overdentures that were retained with ball and locator attachments. METHODS: Under ANSYS environment, four 3 D finite element models were prepared. These models simulated complete overdentures supported by two or four implants with either ball or locator attachments as a connection mechanism. The models’ components were created by CAD/CAM package then were imported to ANSYS. Load of 100 N was applied at the right premolar/molar region vertically and at an oblique angle of 110 ° from lingual direction. RESULTS: Within the conditions of this research, in all cases, {{it was found that}} cortical and cancellous bone regions were the least to be stressed. Also, the ball attachment produced higher stresses. CONCLUSION: Caps deformation and stresses are negligible in cases of using locator attachment in comparison to ball attachments. This may indicate longer lifetime and less repair/maintenance operations in implant overdentures retained by locator attachments.

40|$|Various options {{have been}} {{introduced}} for the selection of <b>implant</b> overdenture <b>attachments.</b> Attachment wear due to the repeated insertion and removal of dentures has caused problems such as decreased retention and the requirement for suprastructure remanufacturing.

In a 55 -year-old female patient who showed three degrees of mobility in most of her teeth due to severe alveolar bone loss, a complete denture in the maxilla and an implant supported type overdenture in the mandible were planned after extracting all the remaining teeth. Six implants were placed from canine region to the distal molar region, and the locator {{was connected to the}} milled bar using the drill and tapping technique. For a 61 -year-old female edentulous patient who complained of poor retention with old denture, a complete denture in the maxilla and an implant-tissue supported type overdenture in the mandible were planned.

40|$|Introduction: While {{using an}} implant-supported {{removable}} partial prosthesis, the implant abutments should be parallel {{to one another}} along the path of insertion. If the <b>implants</b> and their <b>attachments</b> are placed vertically on a similar occlusal plane, not only is the retention improved, the prosthesis will also be maintained for a longer period. Case Report: A 65 -year-old male patient referred to the School of Dentistry in Mashhad, Iran with complaints of discomfort with the removable partial dentures for his lower mandible. Due to the lack of parallelism in the supporting implants, prefabricated ball abutment could not be used. As a result, a customized ball abutment was fabricated in order to correct the non-parallelism of the implants.

40|$|When {{compared}} to a conventional attachment, a (semi) precision attachment for a cast metal frame removable partial denture can perform a number of functions better.

With regard to technical characteristics, (semi-) precision attachments are classified according to measures of freedom. The distinct types are cast intra- and extra-coronal, adhesive and overdenture (semi-) precision attachments. With the lapse of time, some wear of the different parts of an attachment may occur, requiring specific subsequent care.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{multicentre}} observational {{study was to determine}} patient satisfaction with either conventional dentures or mandibular 2 -implant overdentures in a 'real world' setting. Two hundred and three edentulous patients (mean age 68 · 8 ± 10 · 4 years) were recruited at eight centres located in North America, South America and Europe. The patients were provided with new mandibular conventional dentures or implant overdentures supported by two <b>implants</b> and ball <b>attachments.</b> At baseline and at 6 months post-treatment, they rated their satisfaction with their mandibular prostheses on 100 -mm visual analogue scale questionnaires. One hundred and two (50 · 2 %) participants had valid baseline and 6 -month satisfaction data. Although both groups reported improvements, the implant overdenture group reported significantly higher ratings of overall satisfaction, comfort, stability, ability to speak and ability to chew.

40|$|Purpose: Different {{treatment}} protocols {{in terms}} of number, diameter, and suprastructure design have been proposed for immediately loaded implants {{that are used to}} support mandibular overdentures opposed by maxillary conventional dentures. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of these protocols on survival rates as well as clinical and prosthodontic outcomes. Materials and Methods: Several electronic databases were searched for all relevant articles published from 1966 to June 2014. Only randomized controlled trials and prospective studies with a minimum follow-up of 12 months were selected. The primary outcomes of interest were the success and survival rates of the implants. Prosthodontic complications were also evaluated. Results: Fourteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of the studies identified, nine were randomized controlled trials and five were prospective studies. The mean follow-up period was 3 years or less for the vast majority of the studies. The reported survival and success rates were comparable to that of conventional loading for most of the included studies. No specific immediate loading protocol seemed to perform better {{in terms of}} clinical and prosthodontic outcomes. Conclusion: Immediate loading protocols of mandibular overdentures seem to be a viable alternative to conventional loading. It was not possible to recommend a specific treatment protocol related to the number, diameter of the <b>implants,</b> and <b>attachment</b> system used.

Using a universal testing machine, each of the models were subjected to 100 pulls each to dislodge the overdenture from the acrylic model, and the force values as indicated on the digital indicator were tabulated both before and after thermocycling (AT). Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis comprised Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Friedman test, and Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Results: The statistical model revealed a significantly different behavior of the attachment systems both before and AT. The ball/o-ring and bar attachments developed higher retentive force as compared to the locator attachment. The bar and clip attachment exhibited the highest peak as well as the highest mean retention force {{at the end of the}} study. The Locator ® attachment showed a decrease in retentive potential after an early peak. Conclusions and Clinical Implications: The ball/o-ring and bar and clip attachments exhibit higher retentive capacities than the Locator ® attachment over time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Surgical implant {{coatings}} and grafts for {{tissue replacement}} {{have been made}} by porous surface materials to improve the <b>implant</b> to bone <b>attachment.</b> In this work, porous titanium samples were produced via powder metallurgy techniques and submitted to the biomimetic process in order to enhance its osteoconductivity. This process allows a nucleation and growth of a calcium phosphate film which makes a chemical bond with titanium. Therefore, it avoids the looseness of this film from substrate. The samples were chemically treated, heat treated at different temperatures and soaked into a modified body fluid solution (mSBF) during periods of 2 and 7 days. Samples with and without pre-treatments and not soaked in mSBF were used as controls. SEM and EDX analyses detected a calcium phosphate phase on the sample surfaces treated at 400 ºC and 600 ºC and soaked in mSBF for 2 and 7 days. The results demonstrated the potential of the methodology applied for obtaining a bonelike apatite film on porous titanium samples processed by powder metallurgy...|$|R
40|$|AIM To {{evaluate}} {{the outcomes of}} conventional periodontal maintenance therapy on patients surgically treated for peri-implantitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS 27 patients with 149 dental implants were monitored during 5 years every 6 months. At each recall visit, the prostheses were removed to have proper access for implant examination and supra- and sub-gingival instrumentation. Sub-gingival instrumentation was performed using an ultrasonic instrument with under 0. 12 % chlorhexidine irrigation. RESULTS At baseline (6 months following peri-implant surgery), 149 implants (78 not treated and 71 treated) were available for analysis. Of the 71 treated implants, 43 presented healthy peri-implant condition, while 28 had residual peri-implant pockets either of 4 - 5 mm or ≥ 6 mm associated with bleeding on probing/suppuration. The longitudinal evaluation revealed that the plaque and the bleeding index scores were low during the entire follow-up period, and healthy peri-implant conditions were maintained for both the 78 non-treated and the 43 treated "healthy" implants. Of the 28 implants with residual pockets, nine showed clinical attachment loss during the 5 -year follow-up. Thus, of 71 treated <b>implants,</b> probing <b>attachment</b> loss occurred in only in 9 (13 %) of the implants in four patients during the 5 -year period. The presence of residual pockets at three or four sites of the implants (circumferential type of pockets) was frequently associated with increased probing pocket depth (PPD) and attachment loss, while {{this was not the}} case for implants with the presence of pockets at one or two sites only (site specific). CONCLUSION In patients with a high standard of oral hygiene and enrolled in a recall system every 6 months, the peri-implant conditions obtained following peri-implant surgery were maintained stable for the majority of subjects and implants during a 5 -year period. Presence of residual pockets around the circumference of the implants seemed to be a high predictor for disease progression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ni-Ti {{shape memory}} alloy (SMA) {{products}} appeared to the medical markets in 1980 ’s, their global market being more than US $ 130 billion in 2002. In most medical applications material must be biocompatible. Ni-Ti offers the body-temperature activated shape memory effect (SME), superelasticity (SE) and the damping capacity, which all can be applied in medical use. The dental arch wires and stents are benefiting from SE. The Ni-Ti vena cava filters obtain their umbrella shaped mesh when SME-activated. Generally the Ni-Ti tubes and guidewires are applied in the minimally invasive medical procedures and in the interventional radiology. There are numerous steerable, hingeless, kink resistant, highly flexible clinical instruments that may provide constant force. Ni-Ti {{is used for the}} dental <b>implants</b> and the <b>attachments</b> of the partial dentures and for the orthopaedics. In the latter one the main applications are the clamps for connecting bone fractures or parts for e. g. the spinal bent-calibration bar. Miniaturization has enabled small SMA-actuators that are applicable in active endoscopes with all-round bending and in actuators for kidney or heart pumps. The main risks using Ni-Ti are the insecure fatigue life and possible cytotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|Edentulous {{patients}} treated with conventional dentures often experience problems as pain during mastication, insufficient stability {{and retention of}} the dentures because of impaired load-bearing capacity. These negatives enlarge {{with the amount of}} alveolar bone resorption, especially with regard to the characteristics of mandibular denture. Hybrid dentures can successfully solve these problems. The study contained 52 patients, each of them was treated with two implants and tissue borne overdenture. There was not found that the gender plays a role in patient's decision to go through treatment with overdenture supported by dental implants. It was confirmed that patients were more satisfied with implant overdentures comparing with conventional dentures. There is no relation between satisfaction of patients and their gender, age group, type of attachment and type of restoration in the opposite jaw. The age group of patients and the restoration in the opposite jaw will affect the mastication efficiency. This efficiency was not affected by gender, type of attachment and discrepancy in parallelism between the <b>implants</b> in ball <b>attachment</b> restoration. There was no relation between satisfaction and mastication efficiency. Available from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to review {{available}} information on the methods of enhancing retention of maxillary obturators. A maxillofacial prosthesis used to close, cover, or maintain the integrity of the oral and nasal compartments resulting from a congenital, acquired, or developmental disease process, i. e. cancer, cleft palate, osteoradionecrosis of the palate. The prosthesis facilitates speech and deglutition by replacing those tissues lost due to the disease process and can, as a result, reduce nasal regurgitation and hyper nasal speech, improve articulation, deglutition, and mastication. The methods enhancing retention of maxillary obturator are various and selection of it depends on the amount of retention needed {{and the nature of the}} defect. Conventional methods include clasps, silicone soft liner, and sectional prosthesis. A introduction of dental implants in obturator brings wonderful improvement in performance of obturator by exhibiting better mechanical qualities. With diff erent types of <b>attachment</b> the dental <b>implant</b> solved the major problems that encountered with conventional obturator dental <b>implants</b> with appropriate <b>attachments</b> system dramatically improve the retention of the maxillary obturators when recommended prosthetic protocols are followed for the rehabilitation of those cases...|$|R
