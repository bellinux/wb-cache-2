5|$|Although Kennan {{regarded}} the Soviet Union as {{too weak to}} risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into Western Europe through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Europe,</b> which remained demoralized by the devastation of the Second World War. To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan's solution was to direct economic aid and covert political help to Japan and Western Europe to revive Western governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so the United States would help to rebuild the balance of power. In June 1948, Kennan proposed covert assistance to left-wing parties not oriented toward Moscow and to labor unions <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Europe</b> in order to engineer a rift between Moscow and working-class movements <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Europe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of the authoritarian {{government}} in Portugal in 1974, the Spanish government was the sole surviving dictatorship <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Europe,</b> where several countries in 1975 were ruled by socialist parties which had long loathed Franco for coming to power by overthrowing a socialist democracy. Hostility to the use of capital punishment was widespread <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Europe</b> at this time and most Western European countries had ceased using it.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of people and information largely characterizes the inter-world relationships in the present day.

5|$|In 1942, the Western Allies {{agreed to}} open a second front (the Western Front) <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Europe</b> to take {{pressure}} off the beleaguered Red Army in the Soviet Union. While Britain and the United States did not yet possess the resources to mount a full invasion, invasion plans {{that came to be}} known as Operation Sledgehammer were drawn up, in case the German position <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Europe</b> weakened or the USSR's situation became dire. In August 1942 Anglo-Canadian forces attempted an abortive landing—Operation Jubilee—at the French port of Dieppe; the landing was designed to test the feasibility of a cross-channel invasion. The attack was poorly planned and ended in disaster; 4,963 soldiers were killed, wounded or captured. Following the Anglo-American victory against Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in North Africa in May 1943, British, American and Canadian troops invaded Sicily in July 1943, followed by Italy in September. By December the Allies' progress had slowed facing tenacious German resistance and the difficult geography of the Italian Peninsula.|$|E
