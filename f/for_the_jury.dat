25|$|In United States v. Jackalow (1861), the Court {{held that}} Article Three venue must be {{established}} by facts found by a jury. The act of piratical murder by Jackalow was alleged to have occurred on the high seas, between the waters within {{the jurisdiction of the}} states of New York and Connecticut; New Jersey was the first state into which Jackalow was brought upon capture. An 1820 anti-piracy statute provided that, if the crime occurred on the high seas, venue was proper in the first state into which the defendant was brought after capture. The Court held that—although the boundary of New York and Connecticut state waters were a question of law for the judge—the location of the crime was a question of fact <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b> Thus, Jackalow was granted a new trial.|$|E

25|$|One {{contention}} by {{some tax}} protesters {{is that a}} taxpayer {{should be allowed to}} introduce, as evidence in court, copies of statutes, cases or other materials to persuade the jury about what the law is. Courts do not allow this procedure as, under the U.S. legal system, the general rule is that neither side in a civil or criminal case is allowed to try to prove to the jury what the law is. For example, in a murder case the defendant is not allowed to persuade the jury that there is no law against murder, or to try to interpret the law <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b> Likewise, the prosecution is not allowed to do this. Instead, disagreements about what the law is are argued by both sides before the judge, who then makes a ruling. Prior to jury deliberations, the judge instructs the jury on the law. Examples of applications of this rule in tax controversies are United States v. Ambort, United States v. Bonneau, and United States v. Willie.|$|E
25|$|In Adams’ case, {{the court}} did not ignore the {{suggestion}} that he had hastened death and, as Devlin makes clear, he needed to clarify <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> and incidentally the medical profession, {{the extent to which the}} law allowed the orthodox doctor to go in easing the passing of the dying. Mahar regards Adam’s statements to Hannam on Mrs Morrell as less about his guilt or innocence than a disconnection between the medical and legal views on assisted dying: Adams never denied giving his patients large doses of opiates, but denied it was murder. This was not simply Adams' idiosyncratic view, as appears from the evidence of Dr. Douthwaite for the prosecution, who accepted that a physician might knowingly give fatal doses of pain relieving drugs to a terminally ill patients, adding it was not his business to say whether it was murder. Devlin’s directions to the jury confirmed that it was a medical issue, not a legal or moral one, whether Adam’s treatment was designed to promote comfort. Devlin’s view was that Adams may have been guilty of mercy killing or even perhaps finishing off a troublesome patient, but was one who cared for his patients to the best of his ability. Adams eased the passing of Mrs Morrell, but his greed brought his motives into question. Mahar notes an editorial in a medical journal following the case suggested that the publicity it caused might hamper medical discretion, but claimed the use of opiates in terminal cases was essential. Adams may be seen as an extreme case in their use, but other doctors also used them to ease the passing.|$|E

500|$|Several weeks later, Hastings {{represented}} Mosley {{and three}} {{other members of the}} British Union of Fascists (BUF) in a criminal case after they were indicted for [...] "causing a riotous assembly" [...] on 9 October 1934 at a BUF meeting. The trial opened at the Sussex Assizes on 18 December 1934 in front of Mr Justice Branson, with Hastings for the defence and John Flowers KC prosecuting. According to Mosley, Hastings told him that Flowers, a former cricketer, had a poor reputation at the bar, and that Mosley should not show him up too much. The prosecution claimed that after a BUF meeting, Mosley and the other defendants had marched around Worthing, threatening and assaulting civilians. Hastings argued that the defendants had been deliberately provoked by a crowd of civilians, and several witnesses testified that the crowd had been throwing tomatoes and threatening Mosley. The judge eventually directed the jury to return a verdict of [...] "not guilty". Hastings and Mosley were less successful in another libel action, against the Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen who had accused him of instructing his blackshirts to arm themselves. The defence, led by D. N. Pritt KC, called several witnesses to a fight in Manchester between blackshirts and their opponents. Hastings, taking the view that the incident was too long in the past to be relevant, did not call any rebutting evidence. Although Mosley won the case, he was awarded only a farthing in damages, traditionally a way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> to indicate that the case should not have been brought.|$|E
500|$|On January 25, 1996, Cisneros' {{conviction}} {{was overturned}} by the Court of Appeals for the 13th District of Texas in Edinburgh, Texas, {{due to a}} legal technicality. In court, the judge instructed the jury that unless there was evidence showing that Cisneros employed the assassins, or that there was evidence that Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez killed Fischer, {{she could not be}} convicted of capital murder. The jury had no evidence that Cisneros hired the assassins since her only contact was through Martínez. The jury analyzed the circumstantial evidence that linked Puentes Pizaña or Olivarez to the murder. They knew the pair registered at the motel the night before the murder, and left the motel a few hours after Fischer was killed. They also heard they drove a car with a similar description as the one seen at the crime scene, and made several phone calls to the same Dallas number as Garza after the killing, and that Garza said he paid the assassins at a motel. This evidence cast suspicion on the two alleged hit-men, but was not enough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Puentes Pizaña or Olivarez were behind Fischer's murder. The court also recognized that even if Puentes Pizaña or Olivarez were found guilty of the murder, there was not enough evidence to show that Cisneros employed the two or was ever in contact with them. The jury recognized there was evidence that she gave money to Martínez, who in turn gave it to Garza, but that meant there were several parties at fault. In order <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> to find Cisneros responsible for the actions of another party, the judge needed to charge the jury on the law of parties that she was [...] "acting a party to the offense".|$|E

40|$|This essay {{focuses on}} {{cultural}} constructions of infanticide and psychosis, especially {{cases in which}} the mother heard delusional commands to kill her children.

This essay argues that psychotic mothers have been disempowered and silences, so their acts cannot be seen as subversive feminist gestures. Part III, however, argues that the legal trials of Laney and Diaz demonstrate a possible subversion through trial strategy. These two trials more fully told the mother 2 ̆ 7 s story than did the Yates trial and more fully educated juries about postpartum psychosis. These differences made it more difficult <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>juries</b> - even Texas juries - to mete out retributive punishment and much easier <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>juries</b> to react with compassion...|$|R
