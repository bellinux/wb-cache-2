Scully and Briggs visit a chemical plant where a piece of the victim's liver was found, ultimately discovering a skeleton <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete.</b> Meanwhile, Mulder harasses Tooms at work as he stalks a would-be victim. Later that night, Mulder follows him when he tries to break into a man's house. Tooms flees without attacking anyone.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} factors have led to wide {{speculation}} {{that most of the}} 3.5million unsold copies of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ultimately wound up in this landfill, crushed and <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete.</b> It has also been reported that prototypes for the proposed Atari Mindlink controller system were disposed of at the site, which only further fuels speculation, since Atari Museum owner Curt Vendel actually currently owns the Mindlink prototypes. Writing for the Pacific Historical Review, John Wills speculated that location's place in the public psyche—its proximity to the sites of both the Trinity nuclear test and Roswell UFO incident—has aided the popularity of the story.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, {{the castle}} was {{suffering}} badly {{from the effects}} of coastal erosion but remained in military use until 1863. The War Office then demolished the upper levels with explosives, carrying out a second wave of demolition work in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893. The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town of Deal for £35 to form part of the local sea defences. The remaining masonry was <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> in the late 1980s to form a sea wall but remains vulnerable to further erosion by the sea.|$|E

50|$|Franz Dischinger (8 October 1887 - 9 January 1953) was a {{pioneering}} German civil and structural engineer, {{responsible for the}} development of the modern cable-stayed bridge. He was also a pioneer of the use of prestressed concrete, patenting the technique of external prestressing (where the prestressing bars or tendons are not <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> the <b>concrete)</b> <b>in</b> 1934.|$|R
5|$|In 1883 {{architectural}} historian Hayter Lewis {{complained to}} the British Archaeological Association that more {{needed to be done}} to protect the ruins, contrasting their poor treatment with that of the other castles along the coast. Despite this, concerns continued to be raised about the safety of the ruins facing along the sea, and in 1894 the Royal Engineers blew up the bastions and the keep on the seaward side using guncotton. The town of Deal then bought the remains from the government for £35 for use as part of their local sea defences. Coastal erosion continued and between 1988 and 1989 the remains were <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> to form a sea wall, although they remain vulnerable to further coastal erosion. The remains of the castle are protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
25|$|Below {{the train}} shed {{is an area}} once used as a goods station. Its cast iron columns and brick arches support the non-through {{platforms}} above. The area is now used by the Metrolink station, its tracks and sidings, as well as car parking. The columns were <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> for protection against collision.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{design for the}} towers of the bridge called {{for them to be}} <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> and granite. However, because of cost considerations during the Great Depression and favorable aesthetic critiques of the bare steel towers, this was never done. The exposed steel towers, with their distinctive criss-crossed bracing, have become one of the bridge's most identifiable characteristics.|$|E

Its confluence with the Los Angeles River is just west of Mason Avenue and north of Vanowen Avenue.The channel walls near Winnetka were damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake.|$|R
50|$|Several {{methods of}} {{depositing}} {{material in the}} ocean floor have been proposed, including <b>encasing</b> it <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> and as the United Kingdom has previously done, dropping it in torpedoes designed to increase the depth of penetration into the ocean floor, or depositing containers in shafts drilled with techniques {{similar to those used}} in oil exploration.|$|R
50|$|The cAt-project aims {{to offer}} a storage {{solution}} for low and intermediate radioactive waste with a short half-life (less than 30 years), so called category A waste. It is to be <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> modular <b>concrete</b> boxes which are stacked inside structures which ultimately will resemble tumuli on a site adjacent to Belgoprocess Site 1. This structure is to be actively monitored for 300 years.|$|R
25|$|George W. Buck {{designed}} the original skew arch bridge over Fairfield Street with ten cast iron arch ribs {{as part of}} a long brick arch viaduct topped with open stonework parapets. The bridge was widened by adding wrought iron plate girders and transverse girders, supporting longitudinal joists with iron arch plates. As part of reconstruction in the 1960s the cast iron arches and spandrels were <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete.</b> Platforms 13 and 14 are situated on the bridge.|$|E
25|$|In 1896 it was {{discovered}} that the pier needed urgent remedial works, marine worms having infested the wooden piles. Extensive works were undertaken only for the pier to be damaged again, this time by a heavy storm on 28 November 1896. Further repairs were necessary and the service to Victoria Port became intermittent, closing in the winter months with trains terminating at Sharnal Halt. In 1901 the wooden piles of the pier were <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> in an attempt to prevent further infestation, but problems continued after the area around the pier was dredged, thereby exposing the uncased parts of the piers to investigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{wind turbine}} {{originally}} operated on a wind farm in Denmark, which resold the wind turbine while repowering to newer, larger wind turbines. The ground around the wind turbine features an art display entitled Shadow and Light. The display includes walkways that align {{with the wind}} turbine's shadow at solar noon and two hours, eleven minutes after solar noon, respectively. On the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, the wind turbine's shadow also aligns with the walkways by length. Thus the wind turbine functions as a large gnomon in an incomplete sundial. The display includes boxes of light bulbs <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> {{on one side of}} a plaza around the wind turbine's base, representing the amount of electricity consumed by the average American household in a year.|$|E
50|$|The stream {{begins at}} the {{confluence}} of Hansen Heights Channel and La Tuna Canyon Lateral in Sun Valley. It runs adjacent to Interstate 5 {{for most of its}} length and is entirely <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> a <b>concrete</b> flood control channel. The stream travels southeast through downtown Burbank, the Riverside Rancho area of Glendale, ultimately joining the Los Angeles River by the edge of the Los Angeles Equestrian Center.|$|R

5000|$|Today the Tank Stream is <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> a <b>concrete</b> drain {{beneath the}} streets of the central {{business}} district [...] and all native bushland has been cleared. The head of the cove is occupied by the Circular Quay ferry terminal. On Bennelong Point at the northern end of the eastern shore of the cove stands the Sydney Opera House. On the western shore is the historic district known as The Rocks.|$|R
25|$|Measures {{other than}} {{drainage}} {{have been implemented}} to contain flooding in the city. In 1950, dikes were built to confine storm runoff. Rivers that run through the city were encapsulated in 1950 and 1951. Rivers such as the Consulado River, Churubusco River and the Remedio River are <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> tunnels which take their waters directly to the drainage system to leave the Valley. Two other rivers, the San Javier and the Tlalnepantla, which used to feed the old lake system, are diverted {{before they reach the}} city and their waters now flow directly into the Grand Canal. None of water from these rivers is allowed to sink into the ground to recharge the aquifer. While the rivers and streams that flow down from the mountain peaks still begin the way they always have, their passage through the shantytowns lacking city sanitation schemes that surround Mexico City turns them into open combined sewers. Therefore, their final stages are frequently culverted or added to the existing major culverted rivers to keep this water from contaminating the aquifer.|$|E
500|$|The next {{historic}} bridge {{listed by}} MDOT along M-28 {{is over the}} Sand River in Onota Township in Alger County. While not visible to motorists, the bridge, constructed in 1939, is the longest rural rigid-frame span in Michigan. Most bridges of this type were built in urban locations, and soil conditions in the state limit locations for this style of bridge. The bridge over the East Branch of the Tahquamenon River in Chippewa County was built in 1926 as a [...] "formative exercise in what would evolve into a state standard design." [...] The [...] bridge was built with nine lines of I-beams <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete.</b> Only one other bridge in Michigan was built with such concrete encasement.|$|E

However, {{at the request}} of the Japanese government, each of the signatory countries to the treaty agreed that Mikasa could be preserved as a memorial ship with her hull <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete.</b> On 12 November 1926, Mikasa was opened for display in Yokosuka in the presence of Crown Prince Hirohito and Tōgō. Following the surrender of Japan in 1945, the ship deteriorated under control of the occupation forces, but was restored after another campaign led by the Japan Times and Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz that allowed the ship to reopen in 1961. On 5 August 2009, Mikasa was repainted by sailors from [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{largest of}} the ravines, the Don Valley, {{is one of the}} most transformed. The {{southern}} portion of the Don was completely <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> a <b>concrete</b> channel to prevent flooding and allow industry to locate in the area. Along the length of the valley, first the rail lines and then the six-lane Don Valley Parkway were constructed. Today, the industries along the lower Don are gone, and significant efforts are underway to restore the lower Don to a more natural condition.|$|R
50|$|The creek {{begins in}} Brampton, and {{flows through the}} {{community}} of Malton (now part of Mississauga);it continues southeast, past Toronto Pearson International Airport; and through a shallow valley surrounded by the urban neighbourhoods of Islington and Mimico. The creek is often <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> a <b>concrete</b> spillway to contain the fast flowing water that occurs during rainstorms. Mimico Creek crosses Bloor Street near the Islington Subway Station, and empties into Lake Ontario about 1000 m west of {{the mouth of the}} Humber River.|$|R
5000|$|The stream begins {{just east}} of South Main Street between 107th and 108th Streets in Los Angeles. Compton Creek passes through Willowbrook and runs 8.5 mi in total. [...] Most of its route is <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> a <b>concrete</b> flood control channel. Shortly after it passes under West Greenleaf Boulevard, it changes to an earth-bottom section with riprap banks. Joined near its end by East Compton Creek, the creek {{ultimately}} empties into the Los Angeles River just south of Del Amo Boulevard.|$|R
500|$|As {{the master}} artisan, Root drew upon {{a variety of}} {{influences}} in designing the interior and exterior spaces, including Moorish, Byzantine, Venetian and Romanesque motifs. He also provided the architectural innovations that brought together many contemporary cutting edge building techniques. Of particular note was a [...] "floating" [...] foundation—a reinforced concrete slab that provided the building's weight with a solid platform atop Chicago's notoriously swampy soil. [...] The term {{for the type of}} foundation that Root designed is grillage foundation, a foundation where iron rails and the structural beams are combined in a crisscross pattern and <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> to support the building's immense weight without heavy foundation stones. [...] This construction is particularly useful when structural loads are high compared to the natural bearing capacity of the soil.|$|E
500|$|The Red Gate Woods {{later became}} the {{original}} site of Argonne National Laboratory, which replaced the Metallurgical Laboratory on 1 July 1946, with Zinn as its first director. CP-2 and CP-3 operated for ten years before they outlived their usefulness, and Zinn ordered them shut down on 15 May 1954. Their remaining usable fuel was transferred to Chicago Pile-5 at the Argonne National Laboratory's new site in DuPage County, and the CP-2 and CP-3 reactors were dismantled in 1955 and 1956. High-level nuclear waste such as fuel and heavy water were shipped to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for disposal. The rest was <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> and buried in a [...] trench {{in what is now}} known as the Site A/Plot M Disposal Site. It is marked by a commemorative boulder.|$|E
500|$|To {{support the}} 60 story condo tower, One Rincon Hill South Tower has a massive [...] thick pile-raft {{foundation}} embedded deep into serpentine rock. Although some engineers view serpentine rock with suspicion, there are massive structures, {{such as the}} Golden Gate Bridge, that have foundations on rock that is largely serpentine. Rising out of the foundation are the concrete core and large, tall columns of steel-reinforced concrete called outriggers. The core {{is attached to the}} outrigger columns by diagonal, steel buckling-restrained braces which are designed to dissipate energy during an earthquake through controlled hysteretic behavior. This type of advanced seismic system performs {{in a manner similar to}} that of shock absorbers. The braces are also <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> and steel to further mitigate risk of buckling and strength loss. Also of note is the controlled-rocking system which features vertical post-tensioning which runs the height of the building through ducts within the reinforced-concrete shear-wall core. Many of these technologies used in the One Rincon Hill South Tower have never before been applied in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The stream begins {{just south}} of Interstate 210 in the Crescenta Valley. It flows {{southeast}} along {{the eastern edge of}} the Verdugo Mountains, then south through a pass between those mountains and the San Rafael Hills, and finally west to ultimately join the Los Angeles River just northeast of Griffith Park. Its entire path is located within the city of Glendale. With the exception of the free-flowing stream inside the Verdugo Wash Debris Basin Dam, Verdugo Wash is entirely <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> a <b>concrete</b> flood control channel.|$|R
50|$|The creek {{rises in}} Bull Canyon on Oat Mountain. After leaving its canyon, it is <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> a <b>concrete</b> flood control channel, wherein it runs south from Granada Hills though North Hills, Van Nuys (including its airport), and Lake Balboa. South of Victory Boulevard, the river reverts to a {{free-flowing}} stream and joins the Los Angeles River inside the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area. Since 2009 this section {{has been restored}} under a federally funded ecosystem restoration project, in part to protect the important riparian habitat.|$|R

There, it joins Arroyo Calabasas, directly east of Canoga Park High School beside Vanowen Avenue. The confluence marks the [...] "headwaters" [...] of the Los Angeles River, [...]|$|R
500|$|The {{first season}} of the show was {{released}} on DVD after it completed its on-screen run. The show also released its Halloween special, along with two special episodes, on an additional one-disc DVD offering. The show returned for a second season in May 2006, and was {{named one of the}} best shows of the summer by the Tulsa World newspaper. The show was renewed for a third season in July 2006; as of that third season the show was A's number one rated show, with more than 1.5 million viewers. That year he promoted the show with a performance where he was suspended within a cube <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> above Times Square, escaping from the block before it was set to crash to the ground. Magic effects creator Sean Field stated of Angel this year that, [...] "Criss Angel is the biggest name in magic since Houdini ...
