25|$|Result: The interviewers {{felt that}} Stephen Higgins {{was the most}} {{impressive}} candidate out of the remaining 3 in terms of entrepreneurship. However, his CV was filled with exaggerations, and he wasn't {{shown to be a}} trustworthy teammate due to his arrogance and his self-preserved agendas. Although he appeared as a tough <b>guy,</b> <b>he</b> didn't come across with a lot of self-esteem. Geraldine was thought to be the most likeable candidate who appeared with the most determination and a good capacity to learn and develop. The problems the interviewers found with Geraldine included her distracting profile in her CV which included spelling errors, and that she didn't seem capable enough to deliver results at the level Bill wanted due to her inexperience. Steve Rayner was described as a world-class salesman. Although he has exceptionally good skills selling face to face, it was argued about whether he could rise to a much more senior position in the field of sales. Steve couldn't prove this in his CV or in the interviews (particularly to David), but it was said that he did come across with the potential to do so. It was also said that hiring Steve would be a risk, because it was revealed that he had problems with alcohol and gambling addictions in his background.|$|E

Sisko is a builder, {{a different kind of}} <b>guy.</b> <b>He</b> wears his heart a little more on his sleeve, and he acts on emotion, on instinct, more than Picard", Wolfe explained. John de Lancie offered a similar opinion: [...] "Q's relationship with Picard has always been a battle of wits, but I come into Deep Space Nine, and Sisko just bopped me on the nose!
