25|$|The NFL saluted {{four decades}} of champions during the coin toss {{ceremony}} and the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation. The coin toss featured Roger Craig (Super Bowl XXIII, 1989), John Elway (Super Bowl XXXIII, 1999), and Lynn Swann (Super Bowl XIII, 1979). Craig followed the previous year's participants and fellow San Francisco 49ers Craig Walsh (son of Bill Walsh), Ronnie Lott, Jerry Rice, and Steve Young. General David Petraeus performed the actual coin toss. The Steelers called tails, but it landed on heads, so the Cardinals won the toss. Arizona deferred their choice to the second half, and the Steelers chose to receive, making {{it the first time}} in Super Bowl history that the coin toss winner kicked off to start the game. (The NFL had <b>just</b> <b>changed</b> the rule {{before the start of the}} season allowing the team that wins the coin toss to defer the choice to the second half, similar to that in college football and Canadian football.) By winning the toss, the Arizona Cardinals were the twelfth consecutive coin toss winner from the NFC, dating back to Super Bowl XXXII. Joe Namath (Super Bowl III, 1969) participated in the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation and he previously participated in the coin toss in Super Bowl XXVIII. Coincidentally, Namath—a native of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh—ultimately handed the trophy to his hometown team.|$|E
25|$|With {{everyone}} {{now back}} in 2016, Nate reveals the first Dominator invasion {{to have been in}} Oregon, 1951. He takes Mick Rory, Amaya Jiwe, Felicity and Cisco to kidnap a Dominator for information. The Legends successfully capture a Dominator to interrogate, but are themselves captured by federal agents. While in custody, the Legends learn from the Dominator that the aliens arrived to assess the threat humanity posed now that metahumans have appeared due to the Justice Society of America. Felicity and Cisco rescue the Legends and help set the Dominator free. Meanwhile, in Central City 2016, the team learns that the Dominators know about Barry's manipulation of the timeline, deeming him as a threat, and that they demand his surrender in exchange for peace. After the Legends return, the team discovers that the Dominators' weapon is a bomb that will kill all metahumans on Earth, with millions of collateral human casualties. The teams dissuade Barry from surrendering, with Cisco reconciling with him, having realized that continuing the estrangement against Barry was hypocritical of him (having <b>just</b> <b>changed</b> the past-himself). Firestorm manages to transmute the bomb into a liquid and the teams force the Dominators to retreat using a pain-inflicting nano-weapon. Later, as the heroes celebrate their victory, Oliver offers Kara his friendship, and Cisco gives her an interdimensional device that will allow her to travel and communicate between Earth-1 and Earth-38. Martin persuades Jax not to tell the others of his daughter, Lily, whose existence {{is the result of a}} temporal paradox he inadvertently caused when the Legends were in 1987.|$|E

On the topic of O'Malley performing open heart surgery in an elevator, Knight said: [...] "It's a slow change but he's starting to realize, 'The way I have been doing things is not working.' The big thing about the open-heart surgery in the elevator was he was forced into it. He needs to be kind of kicked in the (butt) to do these things." ...|$|E

McKee offered her thoughts: [...] "Meredith and Lexie both want to succeed. They want to be strong. They want to feel normal. They want, so much, to be whole. But it’s a struggle – a genuine struggle for them. Being hardcore doesn’t come naturally. Sometimes, they have to fake it." [...] Grey's personality has been compared with that of Alex Karev's.

500|$|Originally titled as [...] "What Doesn't Kill You", [...] "Stronger" [...] {{was written}} by Jörgen Elofsson, Ali Tamposi, David Gamson, and Greg Kurstin in September 2010. In an {{interview}} with American Songwriter, Tamposi revealed that the song {{was inspired by the}} Friedrich Nietzsche adage ("That which does not kill us makes us stronger") that her mother told her as advice. Although Tamposi found the phrase as saccharine, she submitted it as an idea to Elofsson and Gamson during their writing sessions. Elofsson originally intended [...] "Stronger" [...] for Leona Lewis, who turned it down in the process. Tamposi's manager, Tom Maffei, then had one of his producers, Matty Trump, to produce a demo track later to be pitched to RCA A executive Jeff Aldrich, who later gave the song to Clarkson. Tamposi revealed that Clarkson had also altered a lyric from the track. Aldrich had then commissioned Greg Kurstin, whom Clarkson wanted to collaborate with, to produce and add additional writing to the final version. Kurstin recalled, [...] "I rethought the music part of it, I guess. It had a different tempo, beat, chords, and I kinda just came up with that guitar riff that goes into the verse, {{and that was the first}} thing that I kinda contributed <b>just</b> <b>changed</b> the feel of the song." [...] The song's uplifting theme of empowerment led Clarkson to name her fifth studio album Stronger. saying that it is one of her favorite songs in the album, she said, [...] "Everybody loves the message 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' It's a perfect representation of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} advances {{were also}} highly praised by critics: Lopez claimed that [...] "Relic not only tackled space, but may have <b>just</b> <b>changed</b> strategy games forever." [...] Reviewers praised the full 3D {{nature of the}} game as elevating it from its otherwise standard real-time strategy gameplay systems; Levine said that the 3D was what made the game unique, and Ryan explicitly termed the base gameplay as [...] "fairly similar to any tried-and-true real-time strategy game" [...] but said that the 3D elements and connected mission structure {{turned it into a}} [...] "different breed" [...] of game. Fortune, however, focused instead on the difficulty of the missions themselves, praising the challenge and variety of tactics needed to complete the game and lauding it for having [...] "some of the best fleet battles ever seen in a computer game". Levine, Ryan, Keefer, and Lopez all noted the connected mission structure as an innovation in the genre: by limiting the resources to build ships and pulling the same fleet through the missions, Homeworld converted what would usually be a set of disconnected missions into [...] "chapters" [...] of a continuous game. They felt this connected the player to their fleet as more than disposable units, and added a level of strategy to the game. Keefer and Levine did note, however, that this added a great deal of difficulty to the game, especially for more casual players, as the player could make decisions in earlier levels that rendered later ones very difficult to complete without an explicit difficulty level to counteract it. Ryan and Keefer also considered the 3D movement disorienting at first, though Levine and Samuel said the controls were [...] "as easy as possible".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the conquest}} of the old Republic in 1795, the war had not ended; the Netherlands had <b>just</b> <b>changed</b> sides and now fully participated in the {{continuing}} conflagration, but its role had changed. France did not need its army so much as its naval resources, in which France itself was deficient. In 1796, under the new alliance, the Dutch started a programme of naval construction. Manning the new ships was a problem, because the officer corps of the old navy was staunchly Orangist. People like the [...] "Hero of Doggerbank" [...] Jan Hendrik van Kinsbergen honourably withheld their services. The new navy was therefore officered by people like Jan Willem de Winter, who were of the correct political hue, but had only limited experience. This directly led to the debacles of the surrender at Saldanha Bay in 1796, and of the Battle of Camperdown in 1797. At Camperdown the Batavian navy behaved creditably, but this did not lessen the material losses, and the Republic had to start its naval construction programme all over again. This programme soon brought the Batavian navy up to sufficient strength that Great Britain {{had to worry about}} its potential contribution to a threatened French invasion of England or Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|Ten {{years after}} the decree Paolo Veronese was summoned by the Inquisition to explain why his Last Supper, a huge canvas for the {{refectory}} of a monastery, contained, {{in the words of}} the Inquisition: [...] "buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs and other such scurrilities" [...] as well as extravagant costumes and settings, in what is indeed a fantasy version of a Venetian patrician feast. Veronese was told that he must change his painting within a three-month period – in fact he <b>just</b> <b>changed</b> the title to The Feast in the House of Levi, still an episode from the Gospels, but a less doctrinally central one, and no more was said. But the number of such decorative treatments of religious subjects declined sharply, as did [...] "unbecomingly or confusedly arranged" [...] Mannerist pieces, as a number of books, notably by the Flemish theologian Molanus (De Picturis et Imaginibus Sacris, pro vero earum usu contra abusus ("Treatise on Sacred Images"), 1570), Cardinal Federico Borromeo (De Pictura Sacra) and Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti (Discorso, 1582), and instructions by local bishops, amplified the decrees, often going into minute detail on what was acceptable. One of the earliest of these, Degli Errori dei Pittori (1564), by the Dominican theologian Andrea Gilio da Fabriano, joined the chorus of criticism of Michelangelo's Last Judgement and defended the devout and simple nature of much medieval imagery. But other writers were less sympathetic to medieval art and many traditional iconographies considered without adequate scriptural foundation were in effect prohibited (for example the Swoon of the Virgin), as was any inclusion of classical pagan elements in religious art, and almost all nudity, including that of the infant Jesus. According to the great medievalist Émile Mâle, this was [...] "the death of medieval art".|$|E

The Colts did well under Shula, despite losing to the Cleveland Browns in the 1964 NFL Championship Game and, in 1965, losing in overtime to the Green Bay Packers in a tie-breaking game to decide the NFL Western Division championship. The Colts finished a distant second in the West to the Packers in 1966, and in 1967, with the NFL divided into four divisions of four teams each, went undefeated with two ties through their first 13 games, but lost the game and the Coastal Division championship to the Los Angeles Rams on the final Sunday of the season—under newly instituted tiebreakers procedures, L.A. won the division championship as it had better net points in the two games the teams played (the Rams win and an earlier tie). The Colts finished 11–1–2, out of the playoffs. In 1968, Shula and the Colts were considered a favorite to win the NFL championship again, which carried with it an automatic berth what was now becoming popularly known as the [...] "Super Bowl" [...] against the champion of the younger AFL. The NFL champion, in both cases the Green Bay Packers, had easily won the first two Super Bowls (1967 and 1968) over the AFL winner, establishing for a while then the superiority of the older NFL circuit.|$|E
