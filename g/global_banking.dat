This paper examines how European <b>global</b> <b>banks</b> channelled finance, raised in US wholesale funding markets, via cross-border banking flows to Irish retail banks during the first decade of the euro. The results indicate that global factors, namely the US-sourced funding of European <b>global</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>global</b> risk, were influential in driving cross-border banking inflows to Ireland. Furthermore, the empirical analysis suggests these global factors contributed to changes in domestic private non-financial sector credit during the Irish credit boom. These results shed new light on the factors influencing the international funding of Irish retail banks and changes in domestic credit during the credit boom. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} international Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) by <b>global</b> <b>banks</b> targeting a Jordanian audience. The main research question addressed in this work is concerned with adaptation versus standardisation of international IMC by <b>global</b> <b>banks.</b> The aim of the {{research is}} to establish whether the standardised IMC approach is sufficiently effective when targeting Jordanian customers or whether adaptation of the IMC mix is necessary. A mixed methodological approach has been used consisting of qualitative in depth interviews and a more quantitatively based sample survey. Semistructured interviews were conducted with bank managers. Likewise, a survey instrument in the form of questionnaires were sent to the clients through bank management because of the confidentiality issues. The purpose of the research is to answer the standardisation versus adaptation question with the intention of deriving specific, operationally useful suggestions for IMC improvements for <b>global</b> <b>banks</b> operating in Jordan. The problems and weaknesses identified in current IMC policies used by <b>global</b> <b>banks</b> in Jordan are identified and suggestions for future marketing communications improvements made. These weaknesses and suggestions are integrated into a conceptual model. The managerial implications of adapting the suggestions made are examined and discussed. The weaknesses identified, suggestions made to overcome them and the managerial implications of implementation make an important and original contribution to the subject area from both a practical and conceptual point of view. The findings of the research strongly indicate that significant adaptation is required in order for the IMC approach by <b>global</b> <b>banks</b> to be effective. The findings should be specifically relevant to <b>global</b> <b>banks</b> operating in Jordan but may have relevance to other international companies from different sectors operating in or wishing to operate in Jordan...|$|R
