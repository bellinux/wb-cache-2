25|$|From his {{responsibility}} for documentation and testing, Raskin had great influence on early engineering projects. Because the Apple II only displayed uppercase characters on a 40-column screen, his department used the Polymorphic Systems 8813 (an Intel-8080-based machine running a proprietary operating system called Exec) to write documentation; this spurred {{the development of}} an 80-column <b>display</b> <b>card</b> and a suitable text editor for the Apple II. His experiences testing Applesoft BASIC inspired him to design a competing product, called Notzo BASIC, which was never implemented. When Steve Wozniak developed the first disk drives for the Apple II, Raskin went back to his contacts at UCSD and encouraged them to port the UCSD P-System operating system (incorporating a version of the Pascal programming language) to it, which Apple later licensed and shipped as Apple Pascal.|$|E
500|$|Watchmen {{was first}} {{mentioned}} publicly in the 1985 Amazing Heroes Preview. When Moore and Gibbons {{turned in the}} first issue of their series to DC, Gibbons recalled, [...] "What really clinched it [...] was [...] Howard Chaykin, who doesn't give praise lightly, and who came up and said, 'Dave what you've done on Watchmen is fuckin' A.. Speaking in 1986, Moore said, [...] "DC backed us all the way [...] and have been really supportive about even the most graphic excesses". To promote the series, DC Comics released a limited-edition badge ("button") <b>display</b> <b>card</b> set, featuring characters and images from the series. Ten thousand sets of the four badges, including a replica of the blood-stained smiley face badge worn by the Comedian in the story, were released and sold. Mayfair Games introduced a Watchmen module for its DC Heroes Role-playing Game series that was released before the series concluded. The module, which was endorsed by Moore, adds details to the series' backstory by portraying events that occurred in 1966.|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This paper {{reports on the}} {{formative}} research process {{in the development of}} a series of tuberculosis prevention and treatment <b>display</b> <b>cards,</b> aimed at a community with a low level of literacy. The aim of the project was to evaluate existing posters and to develop a new series of <b>display</b> <b>cards</b> that health workers could use to discuss tuberculosis symptoms and treatment with their patients. Fifty two patients from eight tuberculosis clinics participated in the evaluative process of existing posters and the formative design process of <b>display</b> <b>cards</b> during a structured interview with a qualitative approach. The results indicated that the subjects had difficulty in understanding some of the Western-oriented graphic conventions, and the symbolic and latent messages in the existing posters. Only one of the existing posters obtained an acceptable comprehension level. The comprehension rating of the twelve new <b>display</b> <b>cards</b> improved when they were developed during a formative process with tuberculosis patients. A realistic photographic approach proved to be more effective in communicating the prevention and treatment messages to an audience with a low level of literacy, than did a simplified-illustrative approach. This paper compares the results of this project with those of others and suggests guidelines that graphic designers can use when designing for developing communities. The paper is illustrated with examples of both the existing and the new <b>display</b> <b>cards...</b>|$|R

50|$|Some work on {{automating}} the B-T {{system was}} carried out {{just prior to the}} opening of World War II, especially by French engineers Maurice Deloraine and Henri Busignies, working in the French division of the US's ITT Corporation. Their system motorized the search coil as well as a circular <b>display</b> <b>card,</b> which rotated in sync. A lamp on the <b>display</b> <b>card</b> was tied to the output of the goniometer, and flashed whether it was in the right direction. When spinning quickly, about 120 RPM, the flashes merged into a single (wandering) dot that indicated the direction. The team destroyed all of their work in the French office and left France in 1940, just before Germany invaded, and continued the development in the US.|$|E

Only one mechanical side could operate and <b>display</b> <b>cards</b> at a moment and the operator would rotate the whole drum to perform another shuffling. A shuffling box would be split into five compartments using what they called [...] "partition fingers".
