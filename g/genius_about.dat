500|$|Wisden viewed Hutton, with Jack Hobbs, as [...] "one of the {{two most}} {{accomplished}} professional batsmen to have played for his country", and following the Second World War, critics regarded him as the best batsman in the world. In October 2010, he was chosen as part of the ESPNCricinfo All-time World XI, a team selected by a panel of respected commentators and cricket writers to represent the greatest cricketers of all time. As part of the same process, he was also chosen in England's greatest team. The official Yorkshire history describes him as [...] "technically and aesthetically the best batsman to play for Yorkshire". E. W. Swanton believed that if Hobbs was the greatest professional batsman, Hutton, along with Hammond and Compton, came next. Hutton was more cautious than these others. Following the lead of Herbert Sutcliffe, he saw the role of an opening batsman as defensive. The basis of his game was a good defensive technique, although he was able to accelerate and play attacking shots when the situation demanded. Cricket historian David Frith believes that [...] "there was an apparent touch of <b>genius</b> <b>about</b> his batsmanship", and Alan Gibson described Hutton's off drive as [...] "the glory of the game." [...] He was particularly effective on difficult batting pitches. Of the next generation of England batsmen, Peter May tried to adopt Hutton's mental approach to both batting and captaincy, while Colin Cowdrey later said [...] "I had tried to model myself on Len Hutton ever since I started playing serious cricket." [...] Statistically, Hutton stands near the highest achievers. When he retired, only two men had scored more than his 6,971 Test runs; his average of 56.67 is seventh highest of those who played at least fifty Test matches, as of 2016, while only Sutcliffe has a higher average among openers who scored over 4,000 runs. He also displayed consistency; his annual average only fell below 50 three times, he averaged over 50 each year from 1947 to 1954 and scored 20 or more in 90 of his 138 innings.|$|E

That is my opinion, gentlemen. I know very little of military matters, {{but it seems to me}} that is the course that any man of moderate intelligence would pursue, and I therefore should strongly advise that at least half your volunteer force should take post to defend the native town, and so give time to the remainder to come up and assist in the defence. I shall post my sailors in a position where they can best aid in the defence in this direction, and shall have the guns of my ship in readiness to open fire on the native town if you are driven back." ...|$|E

50|$|During {{her writing}} life, Hofland became {{a friend of}} the {{architect}} John Soane, who asked her to provide a description of his museum in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and of the writers Maria Edgeworth and Mary Russell Mitford. Her first story, The History of an Officer's Widow (1809), earned her £6 from John Harris, a London publisher. One of her many popular books (as Mrs. Hofland) was The Blind Farmer and His Children (1816). Her most popular children's book was The Son of a <b>Genius,</b> <b>about</b> an impulsive artist, which may contain autobiographical elements. It had been reprinted at least 14 times in England by 1841, as well as nine times in America, and translations into French and other languages. Most of her works depict the struggles of a Christian family against hardships. Hofland's Tales of the Priory (1820), Tales of the Manor (1822) and Self-Denial (1835) can be read online, as can The Young Crusoe (1828), and a number of others. She also wrote geographical and topographical books for teaching purposes, and a longer work in verse: A Season at Harrogate (1812).|$|E

40|$|The Synod of Bishops (Rome 1994) {{acknowledged}} {{that women in}} Africa are the backbone of church and society; and yet, in a patriarchal church and society, women are marginalised in both subtle and overt ways. The article interrogates engagement since the African Bishops Synods (Rome 1994 and 2009) with inclusion of women in all sectors of church life and, in particular, the unity and disparity between deliberations and implementation concerning the Roman Catholic Church in Zimbabwe. Pertinent issues include common claims that women are equal to and yet different to men, that women and men play complementary roles, about harnessing the feminine <b>genius,</b> <b>about</b> the exclusion of women from ordained ministry and the accompanying impasses, about a patriarchal church and Shona culture’s impact on women, and about empowerment of women to become proactive agents of their own “her-story”.

40|$|In {{a famous}} Parisian chess café, a down-and-out, HIM, accosts a former acquaintance, ME, {{who has made}} good, more or less. They talk about chess, about <b>genius,</b> <b>about</b> good and evil, about music, they gossip about the society in which they move, one of extreme inequality, of corruption, of envy, and about the circle of hangers-on in which the down-and-out abides. The down-and-out {{from time to time}} is possessed with {{movements}} almost like spasms, in which he imitates, he gestures, he rants. And towards half past five, when the warning bell of the Opera sounds, they part, going their separate ways. Probably completed in 1772 - 73, Denis Diderot’s Rameau’s Nephew fascinated Goethe, Hegel, Engels and Freud in turn, achieving a literary-philosophical status that no other work by Diderot shares. This interactive, multi-media and bilingual edition offers a brand new translation of Diderot’s famous dialogue, and it also gives the reader much more. Portraits and biographies of the numerous individuals mentioned in the text, from minor actresses to senior government officials, enable the reader to see the people Diderot describes, and provide a window onto the complex social and political context that forms the backdrop to the dialogue. Links to musical pieces specially selected by Pascal Duc and performed by students of the Conservatoire national supérieur de musique et de danse de Paris, illuminate the wider musical context of the work, enlarging it far beyond its now widely understood relation to opéra comique. This new edition includes: - Introduction - Original text - English translation - Embedded audio-files - Explanatory Notes - Interactive Material...|$|E
