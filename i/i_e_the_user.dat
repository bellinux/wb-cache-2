40|$|Attribute-based {{encryption}} (ABE) is {{a promising}} cryptographic primitive that allows one-to-many encryption. In such a system, users 2 ̆ 7 private keys {{are linked to}} their access rights. We note that if a user can generate a new private key {{for a portion of}} his/her access right, this could potentially lead to some undesirable situations, which violate the access control policy. Interestingly, to date, there is no work that looks into this matter in detail nor addresses it. We point out that this is a 2 ̆ 2 property 2 ̆ 2 that exists in ABE systems, which we refer to 2 ̆ 2 key-delegation abuse 2 ̆ 2.

Then, considering the mutual interference suppression, we propose an extended zero-forcing (eZF) and an extended maximum ratio transmission (eMRT) precoding methods to minimize the total transmit power of base station and to maximize the received signal power of users, respectively. Thanks to the exploitation of statistical CSI, pilot-based channel estimation is avoided enabling more active users, higher system sum rate and shorter transmission delay. Finally, simulations are performed to validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and the advantages of the proposed precoding methods. Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures, transaction...|$|R

The impact of the densification of different SCells on the network performance is also analyzed to give insights on the network design.
