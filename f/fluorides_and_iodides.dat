40|$|M embrane-based water {{desalination}} processes and hybrid technologies are often {{considered as a}} technologically and economically viable alternative for desalination of geothermal waters. This has been conﬁrmed {{by the results of}} pilot studies concerning the UF-RO desalination of geothermal waters extracted from various geological structures in Poland. The assessment of the feasibility of implementing the {{water desalination}} process analysed on an industrial scale is largely dependent on the method and possibility of disposing or utilising the concentrate. The analyses conducted in this respect have demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} use the solution obtained as a balneological product owing to its elevated metasilicic acid, <b>ﬂuorides</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodides</b> ions content. Due to environmental considerations, injecting the concentrate back into the formation is the preferable solution. The energy efﬁciency and economic analysis conducted demonstrated that the cost effectiveness of implementing the UF-RO process in a geothermal system on an industrial scale largely depends on the factors related to its operation, including without limitation the amount of geothermal water extracted, water salinity, the absorption parameters of the wells used to inject water back into the formation, the scale of problems related to the disposal of cooled water, local demand for drinking and household water, etc. The decrease in the pressure required to inject water into the formation as well as the reduction in the stream of the water injected are among the key cost-effectiveness factors. Ensuring favourable desalinated water sale terms (price/quantity) is also a very important consideration owing to the electrical power required to conduct the UF-RO process...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{concerns}} {{over the role of}} nitrite and high sodium chloride concentrations in cured meat products, nitrite-free alternative meat curing systems consisting of a colorant, the pre-formed cooked cured-meat pigment (CCMP) and antioxidant/chelator mixtures with or without an antimicrobial agent and other usual curing adjuncts have been developed. The present study was conducted to examine the antioxidative efficacy of CCMP (at 2. 2, 6. 2 and 10 μM), alone or in combination with sodium ascorbate (SA) and/or sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), in a β-carotene/linoleate model system. For comparative properties, pro- or anti-oxidative effects of metmyoglobin (MMb), nitrosylmyoglobin (NOMb) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), were also investigated in the same model system at the same concentrations. CCMP exhibited an antioxidative effect at 6. 2 and 10 μM concentrations and its activity was greater than that of NOMb, but less than that of BHA, whereas MMb exhibited a prooxidative effect. Moreover, the antioxidative properties of CCMP in the presence of both SA and STPP (at 550 and 500 ppm, respectively) was marginally enhanced when compared to that of CCMP alone. [...] Sodium chloride, generally regarded as a prooxidant, is always used in curing mixtures. In order to investigate whether this prooxidant effect as well as the influence of salt on water-binding capacity (WBC) and texture originates from the sodium ion or the chloride ion of the molecule, a number of halides and sulphates of alkali and alkali-earth metals (at 100 and 200 meq/kg meat) were examined in a meat model system. Similar studies were carried out using Pan®-salt (52 % NaC 1 + 28 % KC 1 + 12 % MgSO₄ + 3 % Lysine. HC 1), a commercially-available low-sodium salt, at 1, 2 and 3 %. Results were compared with those for 1, 2 and 3 % NaC 1. Lipid oxidation was monitored over a 7 -day storage period at 4 °C using the 2 -thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) test. For systems exhibiting an antioxidative effect, further studies were carried out to determine their content of hexanal. Furthermore, salts with antioxidant activity were tested in a β-carotene/linoleate model system. <b>Fluorides</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodides</b> of alkali metals inhibited lipid oxidation in meat model systems as reflected in TBARS values and hexanal contents and in a β-carotene/linoleate model system. Meanwhile, chloride and bromide salts of alkali and alkali-earth metals had generally a minor prooxidative influence on lipid oxidation in both systems examined. Fluorides of alkali-earth metals did not exhibit an antioxidant activity, presumably due to an ion-pairing mechanism, while their iodide analogues remained effective. Pan®-salt showed a slight prooxidative effect in meat model systems similar to that of NaC 1. [...] Halides and sulphates of alkali and alkali-earth metals (except MgF₂, MgBr₂, MgI₂ and CaF₂) increased the cook yield (ie., WBC) of treated samples whereas most salts (except LiF, NaF and LiCl) imparted a firm texture (ie., high shear force values) to meat. The effect of Pan®-salt on increasing the cook yield and improving the texture of meat was generally less than that of NaCl at the same concentrations examined...|$|E

The simulated reorientation times are consistent with NMR and ultrafast IR experimental results. They are also in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of the analytic Extended Jump Model. Analysis through this model shows that while sudden, large amplitude jumps (in which the reorienting water exchanges hydrogen-bond partners) are the dominant reorientation pathway for the I À case, they are comparatively less important for the F À case. In particular, the diffusive reorientation of an intact F À Á Á ÁH 2 O hydrogen-bonded pair is found to be most important for the reorientation time, a feature related to the greater hydrogen-bond strength for the F À Á Á ÁH 2 O pair.

Their binding {{to a variety of}} anion guests was investigated through nuclear magnetic resonance as well as electrochemical studies. These macrocycles possess extremely interesting binding affinity: 1 H-NMR investigations revealed selectivity in the macrocycles-host binding, particularly with medium sized halide anions, namely chloride and bromide, being most strongly bound. Generally, electrochemistry-based titrations showed good agreement with the NMR host-guest titrations results, with potential shifts being dependent on binding affinities -although there are some specific differences in the results with <b>fluoride</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodide.</b> In the case of nuclear magnetic resonance we found that the fluoride ion is too small in size to be suitable for the macrocycle cavity to bind strongly, whilst in the case of electrochemistry titrations larges shifts are seen after addition of fluoride due to the high charge density of this ion. It was found that more complex oxo-anions also bound to the host and affected the RuII based oxidations. However, in general, the binding affinities for these more complex anions were lower than the highest values for halide guests. Again electrochemical potential shifts generally correlated with binding affinity. Studies also revealed that the electrochemical response to addition of anion guest was complex, as the guest induced shifts of the three RuII oxidations of the bowls were not always the same...|$|R

Methods Human mid-coronal dentin was used; the adhesives were bonded according to the manufacturers' instructions or after the dentine surfaces had been treated with the Riva Star. Teeth were sectioned into 1 mm× 1 mm samples and subjected to a microtensile bond strength test. Results were analysed using univariate analysis of variance and Tukey HSD test. Results Adhesive strengths were adversely affected for all adhesives: manufacturer instructions: Optibond FL 32 MPa, SE Bond 28. 5 MPa, Optibond Versa 35, Riva Bond LC 18. 4 MPa; Riva Star treated groups: Optibond FL 22 MPa, SE Bond 10. 9 MPa, Optibond Versa 9. 6 MPa, Riva Bond LC 14. 5 MPa. Only the GIC and etch-and-rinse adhesive were less effected by the Riva Star application. SEM analysis showed that Riva Star left a precipitate on the dentine surface. Conclusions It was concluded that if Riva Star is used as a desensitizing and cavity cleaning agent then tooth surfaces should be lightly roughened. Riva Star should not be used as a 'whole cavity' 'disinfecting' agent but may be used for spot application where a cavity floor approximates the pulp where caries-affected dentine may still exist, otherwise adhesion may be compromised. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{validity}} of the widely used polarographic method for the determination of stability constants is considered for adsorbable ligands. A polarographic study of the stability constants of the lead(II) -halides indicates that results become less reliable down the group. Agreement with accepted values for the <b>fluoride</b> <b>and</b> chloride systems is good. However, the bromide <b>and</b> <b>iodide</b> stability constants are significantly higher than values obtained by other techniques. This is attributed to complexation with adsorbed ligand in the double layer. It is concluded that polarographically determined stability constants of metal ions with adsorbable ligands are liable {{to be higher than}} “true” values. Such systems would be better evaluated by other techniques...|$|R
40|$|The chemosensing {{properties}} of the polyaza-macrocycle 1 -(6, 7) -acridine- 3, 6, 9, 12 -tetraaza-tridecaphane have been investigated by means of emission fluorescence spectroscopy, considering halide ions as substrates. As {{in the case of}} the free ligand, the fluorescence emission of the complexes is due to the acridinium species which are formed after photoinduced proton transfer reaction. The complexation constants have been obtained for the bi- and tri-protonated ligands in deoxygenated aqueous solutions. Two different emission behaviours have been observed varying the anion. <b>Fluoride</b> <b>and</b> chloride give rise to fluorescence enhancement whereas bromide <b>and</b> <b>iodide</b> strongly quench the emission. The macrocycle shows an unusual higher selectivity towards the chloride anion rather than fluoride. The fluorescence emission has been modelled considering a modified Stern–Volmer equation, taking into account the quenching effects of the largest anions, which can be considered negligible for <b>fluoride</b> <b>and</b> chloride anions. Ab initio calculations allow us to interpret the fluorescence emission of the complexes in terms of activation energy related to the proton transfer reaction responsible for the emission process...|$|R
40|$|In the {{presence}} of hydrogen peroxide <b>and</b> either potassium <b>iodide,</b> sodium chloride, or potassium bromide, purified human myeloperoxidase was rapidly lethal to several species of Candida. Its candidacidal activity was inhibited by cyanide, <b>fluoride,</b> <b>and</b> azide, and by heat inactivation of the enzyme. A hydrogen peroxidegenerating system consisting of d-amino acid oxidase, flavine-adenine dinucleotide, and d-alanine could replace hydrogen peroxide in the candidacidal system. Horseradish peroxidase and human eosinophil granules also exerted candidacidal activity in {{the presence}} of <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> hydrogen peroxide; however, unlike myeloperoxidase or neutrophil granules, these peroxidase sources were inactive when chloride replaced iodide. Cells of Saccharomyces, Geotrichum, and Rhodotorula species, and spores of Aspergillus fumigatus and A. niger were also killed by the combination of myeloperoxidase, <b>iodide,</b> <b>and</b> hydrogen peroxide. Peroxidases, functionally linked to hydrogen peroxide-generating systems, could provide phagocytic cells with the ability to kill many fungal species...|$|R
40|$|Chloride self-exchange was {{determined}} by measuring the rate of 36 Cl efflux from human red blood cells at pH 7. 2 (0 degrees C) {{in the presence of}} <b>fluoride,</b> bromide, <b>iodide,</b> <b>and</b> bicarbonate. The chloride concentration was varied between 10 [...] 400 mM and the concentration of other halides and bicarbonate between 10 [...] 300 mM. Chloride equilibrium flux showed saturation kinetics. The half-saturation constant increased and the maximum flux decreased in the presence of halides and bicarbonate: the inhibition kinetics were both competitive and noncompetitive. The competitive and the noncompetitive effects increased proportionately in the sequence: fluoride less than bromide less than iodide. The inhibitory action of bicarbonate was predominantly competitive. The noncompetitive effect of chloride (chloride self-inhibition) on chloride transport was less dominant at high inhibitor concentrations. Similarly, the noncompetitive action of the inhibitors was less dominant at high chloride concentrations. The results can be described by a carrier model with two anion binding sites: a transport site, and a second site which modifies the maximum transport rate. Binding to both types of sites increases proportionately in the sequence: fluoride less than chloride less than bromide less than iodide...|$|R
