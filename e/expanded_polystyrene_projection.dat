40|$|<b>Expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> {{insulated}} {{panel is}} a building {{material that is}} manufactured by adhering light gauge sheet metal to {{both sides of a}} core of <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene.</b> This report examines how the combustible core of <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> insulated panel behaves when exposed to a radiant heat source at elevated temperatures. A number of fires in commercial/industrial buildings constructed from this product, mainly in Europe, have highlighted concerns about its performance and safety. A series of experiments were conducted which simulated the situation of a flue passing through a roof or ceiling in a building that was constructed from <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> insulated panel. Specimens of the product were placed immediately adjacent to a stainless steel flue with surface temperatures ranging from 600 - 900 °C approximately. The behaviour of the <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> core of the insulated panel was monitored. The primary conclusion of the project was that, although the <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> core of the specimens ignited for the higher flue temperatures, {{there was no evidence of}} the combustion spreading through the core. In all cases, the flaming died out after the core had shrunk far enough away from the flue...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of the addition of various types and various concentrations of <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> foam (both commercial and recycled) on the durability of Portland cement mortars is studied. In particular, the microstructure is studied utilizing the following methods: capillary absorption of water, mercury intrusion porosimetry, impedance spectroscopy and open porosity. In addition, the effects of heat cycles and freeze–thaw cycles on compressive strength are examined. Scanning electron microscopy {{is used as a}} complementary technique. An air-entraining agent, water retainer additive and superplasticizer additive are used to improve the workability of mortars. The results show that the presence of <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> in mortar results in a decrease in the capillary absorption coefficient. The mercury intrusion porosimetry technique and the equivalent circuits previously used by researchers to interpret impedance spectra of ordinary cementitious materials were found to be inadequate for interpreting the microstructure of mortars with <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene.</b> This is due to the polymeric nature as well as the internal porous structure of <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene.</b> A slight increase of compressive strength is observed in mortars with <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> subjected to heat cycles. The compressive strength of mortars subjected to freeze–thaw cycles likely improves because <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> particles absorb part of the pressure of ice crystallization. It is concluded that the durability of mortars improve with the presence of <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene,</b> making them viable for more sustainable usage in masonry, stucco and plaster mortars.

40|$|Article gives {{analysis}} of experimental results of water absorption by <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> slabs. The investigation {{was carried out}} applying different test methods. It was established that the most precise results of water absorption by <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> are obtained when method of increased pressure is applied. Results obtained applying this method show that the water absorption of <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> considerably increases when its density decreases. When the specimen is immersed, the largest amount of water is accumulated between the pores. Due to an even pressure distribution around {{the walls of the}} specimen, water does not push out the air, which is between the pores, and, therefore, a part of the specimen does not soak through. Moreover, spaces between <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> pores usually interact, and, depending on the density of a product, the diameter of them may be up to few millimetres. When the specimen is withdrawn from water, {{all of a sudden the}} greatest amount of water retires from the spaces between the pores...|$|R

The lightweight <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> wall panel was establishing in this study {{in order to develop}} as the {{load bearing wall}}. This study provide the <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> lightweight concrete (EPS - LWC) wall panel with square opening at the centre of wall panel. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the ultimate axial load and maximum deflection of <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> light weight concrete (EPS - LWC) wall panel. At the same time, this study also to evaluate crack behaviour of <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> light weight concrete (EPS - LWC) wall panel with square opening. The material using to establish lightweight concrete wall panel are steel fibre and <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> beads. The using of steel fiber is to minimize the major and minor crack around the opening. For the <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> beads (EPS), it’s using to replace the coarse and fine aggregate to ensure the lightweight wall panel is establish. In this study were conducted two samples which are EPS - LWC wall panel with and without opening. The sample of EPS - LWC wall panel without opening is a control sample to compare with EPS - LWC wall panel with square opening. The result further confirm that the ultimate load of EPS - LWC without opening was 771 kN higher than EPS - LWC with square opening which is 428 kN. The deflection profile was not compliance the Euler’s rule because the wall was experience the maximum deflection at 1350 mm from the base of wall panel...|$|R

Novel preparation method of microencapsules was developed {{on the basis of}} the liquid coalescence method followed by phase separation. Oil droplets of limonene dissolving <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> as a shell material were forced to collide and coalesce with the Isopar oil droplets of core material in the continuous wates phase. When two kinds of oil droplets are collided and coalesced with each other, <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> dissolved in the limonene oil may be phase-separated in the oil droplets newly formed to form the microcapsule shell, because the Isopar oil was a poor solvent for <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> but a good solvent for the limonene oil. In the experiment, the diameter (or number) of limonene oil drop-lets dissolving <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> was mainly changed, because the coalescence frequency between the droplets is strongly dependent on the number of droplets.

40|$|Polymeric foams are {{extensively}} used in {{applications such}} as packaging, sports goods and sandwich structures. Since in-service loading conditions are often multi-axial, characterisation of foams under multi-axial loading is essential. In this article, quasi-static combined shear-compression behaviour of isotropic <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> foam and anisotropic polyethersulfone foam was studied. For this, a testing apparatus which can apply combined compression and transverse shear loads was developed. The results revealed that the shear and compression energy absorption, yield stress and stiffness of foams are dependent on deformation angle. The total energy absorption of the anisotropic polyethersulfone foam is shown to be direction dependent in contrast to isotropic <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene.</b> Furthermore, for similar relative density, polyethersulfone foam absorbs more energy than <b>expanded</b> <b>polystyrene</b> foam, regardless of deformation angle. This study {{highlights the importance of}} correct positioning of foam cells in anisotropic foams with respect to loading direction to maximise energy absorption capability. status: publishe...|$|R
