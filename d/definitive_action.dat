40|$|Objectives. The Government Department of Health (England) has set {{a target}} that by 2008 {{patients}} on pathways that do or may involve medical or surgical consultant-led care should wait no longer than 18 weeks from referral to start of definitive treatment. Department of Health guidance must be interpreted and applied to patients with rheumatological problems. Methods. Provisional guidelines have been prepared in collaboration between the British Society for Rheumatology, British Pain Society, Department of Health (England) and other key stakeholders. Results. Definitive rheumatological treatment comprises a package of care rather than a single action. The care package usually requires input from a multidisciplinary team using several modalities in parallel. Actions within the care package that must be taken before treatment {{can be said to}} have started, are <b>definitive</b> <b>actions.</b> <b>Definitive</b> <b>actions</b> should be based on evidence of cost-effectiveness, tailored to the individual patient and offered irrespective of local availability or accessibility. They should be agreed between partners in the patient’s care. This requires face-to-face consultation between the patient and a health care professional with appropriate expertise and knowledge. All <b>definitive</b> <b>actions</b> specified at the outset of management within specialist care must be initiated or removed by agreement from the patient’s care package before the clock can be stopped in the 18 -week-patient pathway. Conclusions. Service redesign may be necessary in order to achieve an 18 -week-patient pathway for all patients. A consistent and appropriate definition of clock-stops should ensure that patients will benefit from excellent rheumatology specialist care without unnecessary delay...|$|R

You will, of course, in conjunction with him, persevere in the suaviter in modo as long as is consistent with our dignity and honour, and I measure that time by days--perhaps by some very small number of hours. If however, the Greek Government does not strike, Parker must do so. In that case you should embark on board his fleet before he begins to take any hostile steps, in order that you and your mission may be secure against insult.

30|$|Before {{concluding}} on our results, {{which have}} been extensively discussed in the previous section, it is worth emphasising the limitations of this research. There have been restrictions to what we could consider and implement due {{to the structure of}} the model employed. As such, our recommendations are a base for further study rather than a list of <b>definitive</b> <b>actions.</b> The main limitation of this study is the representation of the manufacturer agent as a conglomerate without competing manufacturers. This prevents us from analysing lock-in effects once a certain manufacturer has decided to invest heavily in a given technology. Thies et al. [21] considered this for two manufacturers. Further work could revolve around explicitly modelling competition among more than two manufacturers. Secondly, we have not considered in detail the wider impact on air pollution and GHG emissions that the introduction of new electric powertrain technologies may have should they become widespread. This may dependen on many factors, mainly upstream emissions, resource sources, power grid implications and the opportunity for energy storage from batteries. Nor have we explicitly considered any other externalities of sustainability concerns of EVs (e.g. resource depletion, transport poverties, social exclusion). A further restriction is the conservative approach to user choice modelling that is currently employed in the PTTMAM. We recognise the sophistication of the automobile market and purchase preferences and this has already been identified as an area of ongoing improvement and will be addressed in future work. Similarly, our model pre-dates the changing attitude towards diesel fuel due to its high NOx emissions and observed related accelerated shift towards EVs. Such changing preferences will be incorporated into future model developments. Finally, we appreciate that with such a long-term time horizon to 2050, that there exists many other uncertainties both in the political-economic future of the EU and within the structure of the transport system, through the introduction of new technologies (e.g. autonomous, smart and connected vehicles) and a possible move towards a sharing economy and mobility-as-a-service (MAAS). However, all research has its boundaries and these limitations do not invalidate our findings, merely contextualise them.|$|R

It emerged from {{the work in the}} 1770s of Americus Backers, who {{established}} the normal action for English pianos. In the 19th century, the English action was further modified by French builders, notably in the invention of the repetition lever, which facilitated rapidly repeating notes. Perhaps the best-known English piano action of the nineteenth century is the Brooks action of 1810. One of the most well-known French piano actions was created by Jean Schwander in 1844 (the Schwander action is still used in Bechstein pianos) and improved upon by his son-in-law Josef Herrburger. At the turn of the century, Schwander-Herrburger merged with Brooks, giving us the Herrburger-Brooks piano action, which was the <b>definitive</b> piano <b>action</b> of the twentieth century. Throughout the history of the action, piano makers tended to make it heavier and sturdier, in response to the increasing size, weight, and robustness of the instrument, which was itself part of a general demand for a more powerful sound.|$|R

Mitchell Palmer's home was bombed and numerous bombs intended for other government officials were intercepted http://www.smartpedia.com/img/thumb-slash-a-slash-ae-slash-200px-Palmer_Bumbing.jpg. Terror and outrage, remembered as the Red Scare, swept the country. Riots broke out in {{cities across the country}} against the Union of Russian Workers and other organizations that the public believed to be filled with Communist conspirators. In response to these riots, Palmer created the General Intelligence Division in the Justice Department. J. Edgar Hoover was selected as the leader of this new division that would investigate the identities and actions of suspected revolutionaries.Palmer http://www.crimelibrary.com/graphics/photos/gangsters_outlaws/cops_others/hoover/4a.jpg, who was still not convinced of Bolshevik responsibility, was highly criticized for a lack of <b>definitive</b> <b>action.</b> However, once he believed the country to be in danger of a revolution, Palmer acted decisively. After meeting with his advisors, he decided that the most appropriate action was mass arrests and deportation of foreign radicals. It was on this premise that he ordered the first of the Palmer Raids. In these raids, Hoover and his agency orchestrated a series of massive dragnets and the simultaneous arrests of suspected revolutionaries in multiple cities. During these raids, many suspects were arrested without warrants and suffered from physical injuries incurred from the raiding forces. These abuses of civil liberties were overlooked by the public who enthusiastically backed Palmer and Hoover. They conducted these raids with the mindset that Constitutional Rights were a necessary sacrifice in order to preserve the Government of the United States. Amid these raids, there was still little evidence that the Communists were even involved in the bombings or labor strikes, and many of those arrested were released because of lack of evidence.http://newman.baruch.cuny.edu/digital/redscare/IMAGES_LG/Boosting_him_Up.jpgIt was not until men such as Francis Fisher Kane, a member of the Justice Department, and Lewis F. Post, Acting Secretary, exposed the violation of civil liberties that the public began to question the actions of the Palmer Raids. With the economy stable once again and no violent anarchist acts since the bombing of Palmer's home, the public began to criticize Palmer once again for these violations. The Red Scare was coming to an end.|$|E

The documents include the Articles of the Organization, correspondence and press releases, membership and recruitment materials, newsletters, newspaper clippings and ephemera. Acquisition information is unknown. The collection may have been compiled by AJHS archivists. The Jewish Defense League was founded in 1968 by Rabbi Meir Kahane, Bertram Zeweibon, Morton Delinsky, Irving Calderon, and Chaim Bieber, as an Orthodox Jewish organization with the mission to combat inner city crime, Antisemitism, and the decline in the quality of Jewish life employing direct, often militant, tactics. The JDL also became one of the pioneer organizations in the American Soviet Jewry movement. It advocated Jewish interests in African-American/Jewish relations and in the IsraeliâPalestinian conflict, and promoted Aliyah Zionism and opposed the assimilation of Jews outside of Israel. The JDL philosophy included restoring Jews to their ancient values and the expulsion of the Arab population from Israel. By 1970, the JDL was an ultra-nationalist militant youth movement composed of urban, suburban, student and working-class Jews. The Soviet Jewry movement gave the JDL national prominence and wide support, transforming it from a small vigilante group to an organization up to 15, 000 members strong. The controversial methods of the JDL earned it a reputation of a terrorist and racist organization among the mainstream Jewish agencies and U. S. law enforcement agencies. Members of the JDL conducted bombings of Soviet and Arab properties in the United States. A series of threats and violent attacks were directed at individuals and organizations that the JDL perceived as antisemitic and dangerous to the Jewish people. The Anti-Defamation League characterized the JDL's ideology as racist, violent, and extreme, and multiple instances of JDL activity were officially classified as terrorist attacks by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

CONCLUSION: Cancer guideline content is variable between similarly developed nations and poor guideline adherence does not explain differential survival. Guidelines that fail to cover high-risk presentations or that recommend non-definitive action may reduce definitive diagnostic action.

40|$|Multiple {{clinical}} trials {{have demonstrated the}} beneficial effects of statins in lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein and {{in the prevention of}} cardiovascular disease. However, although statins have a good safety profile, a debate has been ongoing as to whether use of statins increases risk of new-onset diabetes. Recent large scale meta-analyses of statin trials support the concept of a diabetogenic effect of statins, as do some other small trials assessing changes in glycaemia parameters and insulin levels. However, a <b>definitive</b> mechanism of <b>action</b> has not yet been elucidated. Nevertheless, the level of evidence has been sufficient to lead the FDA to make a change to the labelling of statins. This review assesses the current available evidence and offers a clinical perspective...|$|R
40|$|This closing chapter draws {{together}} overall emerging {{points from}} the volume, having resonance with societal {{aspects of the}} wider series of which this is a part. It offers reflection and guidance for an expanding field of study built from the rationale outlined in the Introduction with summative comments influenced by the three chapter sections. It is concluded that dealing with hazards, risks, and disasters in society requires an understanding of cognition and behavior and would require a cultural shift for much of humankind. Although a <b>definitive</b> checklist of <b>actions</b> to be taken is beyond the realms of any one volume, previous learning and the insights {{that are on the}} whole empirically presented within this volume indicate processes that are required to progress for the better...|$|R
40|$|The {{medicinal}} {{value of}} plants lies in some chemical substrates that produce a <b>definitive</b> physiological <b>action</b> {{on the human}} body. Ankaferd comprises a standardized mixture of the plants Thymus vulgaris, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Vitis vinifera, Alpinia officinarum and Urtica dioica. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess in vitro antimicrobial activities of Ankaferd medicinal plant extract. The antimicrobial activity assay was performed by agar well diffusion to assess the antagonistic activity of Ankaferd against 26 indicator strains including human pathogens and food spoilage, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Ankaferd was found to be active against all bacteria tested while nisin, the only commercial bacteriocin for food preservation, was inactive against Gram-negative indicator strains. Besides a high inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including human pathogens and food spoilage bacteria, Ankaferd was found to be more stable than nisin in different heat and enzyme treatments. Antibacterial activity of Ankaferd can be extended to extreme environmental conditions such as potential use of the preparation for the therapy of infectious diseases and preservation of different type foods from food-born pathogens or food spoilage bacteria. The demonstration of the anti-infective properties of Ankaferd adds a new value to its haemostatic effect in the healing of infected hemorrhagic wounds, as well as opening new avenues for its potential use in anti-infective actions and food preservation...|$|R
