5000|$|His {{dismissal}} {{as editor}} became known on 25 May 2016, and followed his appearance on a talk programme on Onda Cero, {{in which he}} asked the presenter whether they accepted [...] "ex-editors". His termination took place during a serious crisis for the newspaper and its owner Unidad Editorial, which was undertaking its third round of redundancies since 2009. The workforce were taking <b>intermittent</b> <b>strike</b> action in protest against a proposal to dismiss over 160 staff, a plan that Jiménez had opposed. Jiménez attributed his dismissal to his resistance to pressures that would have compromised {{the independence of the}} newspaper, and in June 2016 he was the first editor of a Spanish newspaper {{to take advantage of a}} constitutional [...] "conscience clause" [...] intended to protect the freedom of the press, when he denounced Antonio Fernández-Galiano, the president of Unidad Editorial.|$|E
40|$|Although {{over thirty}} {{years have passed since}} the {{enactment}} of our Constitution, and the right to strike is thereby acknowledged as a fundamental right that therefore needs to be set out in an Organic Law, the regulations on the matter date from before the Constitution and consequently the Constitutional Court, through its doctrine (STC 11 / 1981 of 8 th April [RTC 1981, 11]), has had to step in to save them from being unconstitutional. But despite the existence of doctrine of case-law from the Constitutional and the Supreme Courts, disputes about the qualification of the right to strike have continued, especially if we go into topics such as the need to regulate the establishment of minimum services and in view of the range of new situations of conflict that occur today because they are not provided for. An example of this situation is the recent ruling of the Social Court No. 16 of Madrid, dated 24 th January 2011, on the failure to comply with minimum services in the Madrid Metro, which judged the strike on 29 th and 30 th June 2010 to be illegal; in the same ruling reference is also made to the failure to enact an Organic Law and the need to resort to the Constitutional Court (STC 11 / 1981 of 8 th April) to interpret {{the extent to which a}} service can be considered essential when it comes to scheduling minimum services. As pointed out by the Constitutional Court, the judge has decided to declare the strike illegal based on a careful weighing up or evaluation of the effects of the strike in each case, since, on the one hand, it is necessary to guarantee a service where constitutional precepts converge with the fundamental right to strike and the right to communication, transport, attendance at place of work, and so forth (STC 56 / 1983 of 5 th May [RTC 1983, 56], which we will address in the Ruling that we now go on to discuss below. In my opinion, the Ruling of the National High Court of Spain (AS 2011, 3) mentioned above does not address the issues underlying the strikes in enough depth and neither does it get to grips with the effects that might arise from calling strikes that coincide with one another or overlap. The Court insists on its being exceptionally called off, without addressing the fact that this cancellation cannot be compared with withdrawal, since, as indicated by the Supreme Court in its Ruling dated 17 th December 1999 (RJ 2000, 522) “(…) Withdrawal is an act of will by the strike committee or body that has promoted the conflict measure that puts an end to the declared labour conflict, thus declaring it to be over on a permanent or at least unlimited basis (…) ” and calling off a strike entails an act of withdrawal, hence withdrawal in an <b>intermittent</b> <b>strike</b> must affect all of it and not just the “stoppages” that are interspersed between times of actual work; the cancellation of a period of time could therefore never affect the withdrawal of the whole strike (FJ Noveno, STS 17 th December 1999). So, why is it called an exceptional cancellation? A strike that has been called should not be qualified until it has finished, because who can assure us that during the period between 8 th June and 30 th June there will not be another "exceptional cancellation"? Moreover, neither does it address the issue of the strike that “overlaps” that day with the evening cancellation of the <b>intermittent</b> <b>strike,</b> the fact that it is noted that it affects the whole enterprise and it is eluded by rejecting the appeal in joint litigation with the Sindicato Ferroviario SF (which had called a strike for that day), when, additionally, the enterprise had not even taken the steps necessary to propose a series of minimum services, how was the enterprise going to bring proceedings against that Sindicato...|$|E

40|$|Background Kickboxing is a high-intensity <b>intermittent</b> <b>striking</b> combat sport, {{which is}} {{characterized}} by complex skills and tactical key actions with short duration. Objectives The present study compared and verified the relationship between mental toughness (MT), countermovement jump (CMJ) and medicine ball throw (MBT) power tests by outcomes of high-level kickboxers during National Championship. Materials and Methods Thirty two high-level male kickboxers (winner = 16 and loser = 16 : 21. 2 ± 3. 1 years, 1. 73 ± 0. 07 m, and 70. 2 ± 9. 4 kg) were analyzed using the CMJ, MBT tests and sports mental toughness questionnaire (SMTQ; based in confidence, constancy and control subscales), before the fights of the 2015 national championship (16 bouts). In statistical analysis, Mann-Withney test and a multiple linear regression were used to compare groups and to observe relationships, respectively, P ≤ 0. 05. Results The present results showed significant differences between losers vs. winners, respectively, of total MT (7 (7; 8) vs. 11 (10. 2; 11), confidence (3 (3; 3) vs. 4 (4; 4)), constancy (2 (2; 2) vs. 3 (3; 3)), control (2 (2; 3) vs. 4 (4; 4)) subscales and MBT (4. 1 (4; 4. 3) vs. 4. 6 (4. 4; 4. 8)). The multiple linear regression showed a strong associations between MT results and outcome (r = 0. 89), MBT (r = 0. 84) and CMJ (r = 0. 73). Conclusions The findings suggest that MT will be more predictive of performance in those sports and {{in the outcome of}} competition.

The logistic equation has often been used to describe population growth processes and replacement processes. It sometimes suffers from contradicting observational data.
