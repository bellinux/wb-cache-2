50|$|Even {{though more}} {{individual}} jackbolts must be tightened, installation is still fast {{in comparison to}} other methods. Because the torque required to tighten each small <b>jackbolt</b> is exponentially less than the torque required to tighten one large nut, it takes less time and effort overall to tighten the larger number of jackbolts. Also, no additional time is spent moving around heavy equipment to tighten each nut. Installation processes have been developed using air tools, which also greatly reduces installation time. Additionally, multiple workers can work on a joint simultaneously since the tooling required is inexpensive. Another common method, thermal tightening, can {{take a long time}} because the stud must be heated, and clamping force is not obtained and cannot be checked until it is cooled since it depends on shrinkage. If the stud is not at proper stretch, the heating process must be repeated.|$|E
50|$|Bolt type MJTs, {{otherwise}} known as Torquebolts, have a ring of <b>jackbolts</b> almost touching the bolt shank. They typically have a smaller outside diameter than Torquenuts. With Torquebolts, {{it is possible to}} have very close spacing even at high preloads.|$|R
50|$|Multi-jackbolt {{tensioners}} (MJTs), registered {{under the}} trademark Superbolt or Supernut, {{are designed to}} decrease the torque required to tighten large bolted joints. One of the major problems associated with traditional bolt tightening methods is as {{the diameter of the}} bolt increases, the amount of torque required to tighten it increases in the third power of the diameter. Because of this, the largest size bolt a person can typically tighten by hand is 1".Multi-jackbolt tensioners reduce the amount of torque required to clamp the joint by using multiple <b>jackbolts</b> threaded through the nut or bolt head.The <b>jackbolts,</b> which are small enough to be tightened by simple hand tools, thrust against a hardened washer and generate clamping force on the joint. Loads up to 20,000,000 pounds and greater are attainable using only hand tools. MJTs and related products are produced by Superbolt, Inc. in Carnegie, PA.|$|R
5000|$|MJTs {{can also}} be {{engineered}} to specifications for almost any application. There are few size limitations, {{and they can be}} used with extremely large thread sizes (as high as 32" [...] thread diameter). [...] They {{can also be}} used effectively in high temperature applications, given proper materials are used. Overall, the unique properties of MJTs created by the use of <b>jackbolts</b> can simplify complicated applications, especially for large thread sizes.|$|R
50|$|Multi-jackbolt {{tensioners}} (MJT) {{provide an}} alternative to traditional bolted joints rather than needing to tighten one large bolt, MJTs use several smaller <b>jackbolts</b> to drastically reduce the torque required to attain a certain preload. MJTs range in thread sizes from 3/4” to 32” and can achieve up to 20 million pounds of force and greater. MJTs only require hand-held tools, such as torque wrenches or air/electric impacts, for loading and unloading bolted joints.|$|R
50|$|A superbolt, or multi-jackbolt {{tensioner}} is {{an alternative}} type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual <b>jackbolts,</b> which are threaded through {{the body of the}} nut and push against a hardened washer. Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced. Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.|$|R
50|$|Thrust-collar type MJTs {{are used}} in {{applications}} where {{it is difficult to}} use threaded tensioners, such as on rolling mills where the joint would typically need to be tightened by crane wrenching. <b>Jackbolts</b> push a threadless nut against a retainer ring, which is fitted into a groove and transfers the jacking force to the main bolt or stud. Because there are no threads, they can also be used in press column applications, eliminating the problems and hassles associated with large nut threads.|$|R
