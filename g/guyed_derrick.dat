50|$|In the end, the Bad Asses emerged victorious, {{winning an}} {{additional}} $150,000 {{on top of}} the $90,000 that they earned in the previous missions, for a grand total of $240,000, while the Good Guys earned $60,000. Defeating the Good <b>Guys,</b> <b>Derrick</b> Kosinski and Tonya Cooley finally took home their first win. Kosinski and Cooley participated in five prior challenges, two of which Kosinski was eliminated the day before the final challenge and one where Cooley was in the finals only.|$|R

50|$|The Stiffleg derrick, {{also known}} as a Scotch derrick, is a derrick with a boom similar to a <b>guy</b> <b>derrick,</b> but instead of using guy wires to secure the top of the mast, it uses two or more stiff members, called stifflegs, which are capable of {{resisting}} either tensile or compressive forces. Sills may also be used to connect between the bottom ends of the stifflegs and the base of the mast. There may be a counterweight to place on the sills behind the stifflegs in heavy load lifting. Stiffleg derrick on a vessel is called a floating stiffleg derrick. Derricks are especially useful for high rise rigging, jobs that cover a long period of time, or jobs when the impact to the street/pedestrian traffic is a concern.|$|R
50|$|Jay, as a fair cop, {{has to be}} {{partnered with}} some other <b>guy</b> named <b>Derrick</b> (Jordan Peele). The problem is that <b>Derrick</b> is the <b>guy</b> who he fought with few minutes earlier about a parking space. The two {{of them seem to}} get along though and they enjoy their duties as fair cops.|$|R
50|$|A derrick is a {{lifting device}} {{composed}} at minimum of one guyed mast, as in a gin pole, {{which may be}} articulated over a load by adjusting its <b>guys.</b> Most <b>derricks</b> {{have at least two}} components, either a guyed mast or self-supporting tower, and a boom hinged at its base to provide articulation, as in a stiffleg derrick.|$|R
50|$|<b>Guy</b> <b>derrick</b> (also {{known as}} boom derrick) is a fixed <b>guyed</b> mast <b>derrick</b> {{that can be}} rotated and {{connected}} to a boom. The mast is in upright position with the base that can make the mast rotate, but not to be lean in any direction. The top of the mast is connected to many guy wires which are anchored to the ground to support the load. At the base, the mast is also connect to the bottom end of the boom. The boom extends outward and upward to the desired position. The top of the boom is a pulley system that {{is connected to the}} top of the mast to control how far the boom is to be from the mast. When the mast is rotated, the connected boom is swung from to the side. The control of the lifting location is done by the manipulation of the top pulley system and the rotation of the mast at the base. The load is lifted by another pulley system connected {{to the top of the}} boom. In a medium load lifting, another construction method can be used. In this case, the mast is fixed without being rotated, but the boom can be swung around the mast. This can be done by connecting the bottom of the boom with two boards on the opposite sides around the surface of the boom to form a fork. The fork and the bottom part of the boom is lashed to secure them together. Another lashing is between the fork area and the mast at a higher position to support the weight of the boom. The fork is put around the mast such that the bottom of the boom is rested on the mast without permanently fixed to it. The fork prevent the boom to come off the mast while swinging up to 180 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Governors Cup: Donnie Seale {{played two}} games in which Pepsi {{narrowly}} lost to Shell and Purefoods, Seale was sent home in favor of Gregory Guy, who lasted three games and also didn't impressed the coaching staff, coming in to replace Greg <b>Guy</b> was <b>Derrick</b> Canada. On October 15, Pepsi Mega won over Ginebra San Miguel, 112-106, in a match-up between the league's two doormat teams. The Bottlers close out their season campaign by winning their last game against Sta.Lucia Realtors, 97-91 on November 10.|$|R
5000|$|The boom is {{connected}} with {{the lower part of}} the mast which is shaped like a [...] "Y" [...] or a bipod and therefore it is a single swinging derrick. On the cross trees, two guys are fastened using swivel outriggers which are stayed vertically and horizontally. In order to maintain a good controlling angle between <b>guys</b> and <b>derrick,</b> the outriggers cannot pass the inboard parallel of the centerline. Looking at the illustration, one can easily see that the right outrigger stays in the centerline and the left outrigger has moved outboard. This derrick will lower or heave cargo as both guys are veered or hauled. Three winches, controlled by joystick, are necessary to operate the Hallen Derrick; two for the guys and one for the purchase. To avoid an over-topping or over-swinging limit-switches are used. However, the limits can be modified if a different working range or a special vertical stowage is required. The safe working load (SWL) of the Hallen is between 10 and 80 tonnes. In a Hallen Universal derrick, which has no Hallen D-Frame, the halyard has an extended length since it runs through further blocks on the centerline. The Universal Hallen derrick, replacing the D-frame option, is a kind of traditional topping lift. The Hallen D-Frame is a steel bracket welded on the mast in the centerline. For an observer standing a beam, the frame has a [...] "D"-shape. The D-Frame supersedes the outriggers and provides a good controlling angle on the <b>guys.</b> The Hallen <b>derrick</b> has a good purpose for e.g. containers, logs, steel rail, sawn timber and heavy lifts and doesn't lend itself for small, general cargo. It keeps the deck clear of guy ropes and preventors. Only one winchman is needed and within a few minutes the Hallen is brought into use. It is less expensive than a crane. A disadvantage is the low working range of the Hallen Derrick, it is able to swing 75° from the centerline and can work against a list of up to 15°.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Conventionally, the {{influence}} of guy wire and wind load on derrick was often ignored in the static strength analysis of derrick of truck-mounted workover rig, it does not accord with the actual working conditions. This paper made the finite element analysis for one derrick of Truck-mounted workover rig through ABAQUS software. The author derive the maximum static hock load which derrick can bear, and reasonably shorten projective radius of guy wire, under different static hock load and wind load, determining the weakest position of derrick. Truck-mounted workover rigs are widely used in the filed of workover and drilling operation, due to their characteristic of power maneuverability and convenient to use. Derrick is the mainly working part of workover rig, {{as well as the}} weak links of workover. In order to guarantee relatively high security performance, we should accurately make simulated calculation for carrying capacity of derrick in the process of designing. The author derive the maximum static hock load which derrick can bear, and reasonably shorten projective radius of guy wire, by using the ABAQUS FEM system, apply for statics analysis of derrick under different static hock load and wind load. 1.
