5|$|Thirty-one {{isotopes}} of actinium {{and eight}} excited isomeric states {{of some of}} its nuclides were identified by 2010. Three isotopes, 225Ac, 227Ac and 228Ac, were found in nature and the others were produced in the laboratory; only the three natural isotopes are used in applications. Actinium-225 {{is a member of the}} radioactive neptunium series; it was first discovered in 1947 as a decay product of uranium-233, it is an α-emitter with a half-life of 10 days. Actinium-225 is less available than actinium-228, but is more promising in radiotracer applications. Actinium-227 (half-life 21.77 years) occurs in all uranium ores, but in small quantities. One <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> uranium (in radioactive equilibrium) contains only 2 <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> 227Ac. Actinium-228 is a member of the radioactive thorium series formed by the decay of 228Ra; it is a β− emitter with a half-life of 6.15 hours. In one tonne of thorium there is 5 <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> 228Ac. It was discovered by Otto Hahn in 1906.|$|E

5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> glucose consumed. Nitrogen fixation requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric nitrogen is not fixed, the source of nitrogen can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for the growth and nitrogen fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen is available in the soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E
