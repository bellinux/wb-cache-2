The building is postmodern in style and includes rose windows, false chimneys, and gables. The entire station was designed by the architectural firm OTAK Inc. and also includes an electrical substation. Hatfield's name is <b>etched</b> <b>in</b> the façade of the main station building in stone.|$|E
5|$|Items include granite pavers {{that have}} {{memories}} of past Hillsboro citizens {{carved into the}} stone and photographs etched onto glass. Photographs range from pioneer times {{to life in the}} 1990s. There are also letters <b>etched</b> <b>in</b> glass from people such as Albert E. Tozier, Robert Summer, Chavela Mendoza, Lester C. Mooberry, Mary Ramsey Wood, George Iwasaki, and Howard Vollum. Gunfights, hangings, funerals, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the Great Depression, and an outbreak of diphtheria in the 1890s are among the events represented. More recent photographs show the defunct Oregon Electric Railway, which the westside line often uses the old right-of-way of the former line, and employees at Intel dressed in cleanroom suits.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, a geisha {{was paid}} {{for the number of}} senkodokei (incense sticks) that had been {{consumed}} while she was present, a practice which continued until 1924. Incense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock; while religious purposes were of primary importance, these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals. The seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves <b>etched</b> <b>in</b> it into which incense was placed. These clocks were common in China, but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan. To signal the passage of a specific amount of time, small pieces of fragrant woods, resins, or different scented incenses could be placed on the incense powder trails. Different powdered incense clocks used different formulations of incense, depending on how the clock was laid out. The length of the trail of incense, directly related {{to the size of the}} seal, was the primary factor in determining how long the clock would last; all burned for long periods of time, ranging between 12 hours and a month.|$|E

25|$|Although {{he spent}} the {{majority}} of his life in America, Muir never forgot his roots in Scotland. He held a strong connection with his birthplace and Scottish identity throughout his life and was frequently heard talking about his childhood spent amid the East Lothian countryside. He greatly admired the works of Thomas Carlyle and poetry of Robert Burns; he was known to carry a collection of poems by Burns during his travels through the American wilderness. He returned to Scotland on a trip in 1893, where he met one of his Dunbar schoolmates and visited the places of his youth that were <b>etched</b> <b>in</b> his memory. He also never lost his strong Scottish accent despite having lived in America for many years.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{application}} of CE in forensic science {{is the development of}} methods for amplification and detection of DNA fragments using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which has to lead to rapid and dramatic advances in DNA typing in forensic. DNA separations are carried out using thin CE, 50-mm, fused silica capillaries filled with a sieving buffer. These capillaries have excellent capabilities to dissipate heat, permitting much higher electric field strengths to be used than slab gel electrophoresis. Therefore separations in capillaries are rapid and efficient. Additionally, the capillaries can be easily refilled and changed for efficient and automated injections. Detection occurs via fluorescence through a window <b>etched</b> <b>in</b> the capillary. Both single-capillary and capillary-array instruments are available with array systems capable of running 16 or more samples simultaneously for increased throughput.|$|E

5000|$|Cuspicephalus {{was first}} named by David M. Martill and Steve <b>Etches</b> <b>in</b> 2013 {{and the type}} species is Cuspicephalus scarfi. The generic name is derived from cuspis, Latin for [...] "point", after its pointed rostrum, and a Latinised Greek κεφαλή, kephalè, for [...] "head".

25|$|His first {{venture into}} etching {{seems to be}} a single self-portrait {{inserted}} into a large print of the ceremonial entry of the new Duke Henri into Nancy in 1610. The established printmaker Friedrich Brentel and his young assistant Matthias Merian—later a major producer of maps and town views—had been brought in to produce a series of prints depicting the funeral of the old Duke Charles in 1608, and the celebrations for the new duke after mourning was complete. Plate 10 of the series shows a large group of mounted courtiers as part of a procession, and it was realized in 1971 that one of the figures, and his horse, is <b>etched</b> <b>in</b> a completely different style, that can be related to Bellange's other prints. It is now generally agreed that Bellange persuaded Brentel (or vice versa) that he should portray himself. This would have been in 1611, and a bookplate that looks to be an early effort is dated 1613; after that, none of his prints are dated, although most are signed.|$|E
25|$|Microdispensing {{was used}} to create micropatterns on {{polystyrene}} culture dishes by dispensing droplets of adhesive laminin and non-adhesive bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions. The microdispenser is a piezoelectric element attached to a push-bar {{on top of a}} channel <b>etched</b> <b>in</b> silicon, which has one inlet at each end and a nozzle in the middle. The piezoelectric element expands when voltage is applied, causing liquid to be dispensed through the nozzle. The microdispenser is moved using a computer-controlled x-y table. The micropattern resolution depends on many factors: dispensed liquid viscosity, drop pitch (the distance between the centre of two adjacent droplets in a line or array), and the substrate. With increasing viscosity the lines become thinner, but if the liquid viscosity is too high the liquid cannot be expelled. Heating the solution creates more uniform protein lines. Although some droplet overlap is necessary to create continuous lines, uneven evaporation may cause uneven protein concentration along the lines; this can be prevented through smoother evaporation by modifying the dispensed solution properties.|$|E
25|$|The Tigers {{went into}} the finals without a single player who had played finals before, which seemed the only chink in the team's armour. However, in the semi final against Carlton, Hart led the way with a best afield {{performance}} and booted six goals. Two weeks later, Richmond played a Grand Final against Geelong considered {{as one of the}} classic matches of Australian football. Hart gathered 13 kicks and six handpasses but it was one of his seven marks that remains eternally <b>etched</b> <b>in</b> the memory. In the dying minutes, Hart rose above his opponent to grab the ball from a kick in by Geelong's Roy West and helped keep the momentum going the Tigers' way. In the end, Richmond hung on to win by nine points to end a 24-year premiership drought. Richmond's emphasis on attacking and kicking high scores became the new trend, and within a few years the game would be much more offense-orientated. To cap an extraordinary first year, Hart won the club goalkicking award, was voted recruit of the year and represented Australia in Ireland in the first contact between Australian and Gaelic football.|$|E

25|$|Ferdowsi's Shahnameh inspires {{tales of}} heroic act by protagonists {{fighting}} against their antagonists. In that sense it {{is a national}} epic that encompasses not only fictional and literary figures but also incorporates parts {{of the history of}} pre-Islamic Iran. This has led to the interior of the edifice of Ferdowsi to reflect the same heroic scenes. The chief architect responsible for the design of the interior of the tomb of Ferdowsi is Feraydoon Sadeghi who created deep frieze scenes using three dimensional statues each depicting a scene from Shahnameh. Rostam, the hero of the book of Shahnameh is the focus {{of the majority of the}} scenes inside of the edifice. As Shahnameh is essentially a text, artistic recreation of its heroic scenes are multiple. Centered inside the edifice surrounding by the frieze scenes and other artistic endeavors is the tomb stone of the poet. <b>Etched</b> <b>in</b> the tomb stone in Farsi (Persian) is the description of Ferdowsi's contribution to the Persian-speakers and at the end it ends by denoting the poet's date of birth, date of death, and the date at which the mausoleum was built.|$|E
25|$|Field of Empty Chairs: 168 empty chairs hand-crafted from glass, bronze, {{and stone}} {{represent}} {{those who lost}} their lives, with a name <b>etched</b> <b>in</b> the glass base of each. They sit on {{the site where the}} Murrah Building once stood. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The chairs are arranged in nine rows to symbolize the nine floors of the building; each person's chair is on the row (or the floor) on which the person worked or was located when the bomb went off. The chairs are also grouped according to the blast pattern, with the most chairs nearest the most heavily damaged portion of the building. The westernmost column of five chairs represents the five people who died but were not in the Murrah Building (two in the Water Resources Board building, one in the Athenian Building, one outside near the building, and one rescuer). The 19 smaller chairs represent the children killed in the bombing. Three unborn children died along with their mothers, and they are listed on their mothers' chairs beneath their mothers' names.|$|E
500|$|According to {{military}} historian Ronald Spector, {{it is impossible}} to reasonably record the fighting at Khe Sanh as an American victory.

25|$|Undercuts from etching are {{somewhat}} {{different than the}} undercuts explained above, {{because it is a}} side effect, not an intentional feature. Undercuts from etching can occur from two common causes. The first is over etching, which means the etchant was applied too long. The second is due to an isotropic etchant, which means the etchant <b>etches</b> <b>in</b> all directions equally. To overcome this problem an anisotropic etchant is used.|$|R
