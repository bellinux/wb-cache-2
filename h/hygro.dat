40|$|The {{selectin}} {{class of}} adhesion molecules plays {{a critical role}} in facilitating leukocyte adhesion to and subsequent transmigration of endothelium. On this basis, selectins have been suggested to promote tumor cell attachment to endothelium, thereby facilitating metastasis of certain types of tumors, although direct evidence for such a role is lacking. To explore this hypothesis, two sets of transgenic mice were developed: TgnES, which constitutively expresses cell surface E- selectin in all tissues, {{under the control of the}} beta-actin promoter; and TgnEsol, which expresses truncated, soluble E-selectin in the liver, under the control of the alpha 1 antitrypsin promoter. B 16 F 10 melanoma cells were stably transfected with alpha(1, 3 / 1, 4) fucosyltransferase-specific cDNA (B 16 F 10 ft), allowing them to express E- selectin ligands or with hygromycin resistance selection vector only B 16 F 10 <b>hygro).</b> Normal mice injected with B 16 F 10 ft and B 16 F 10 <b>hygro</b> and transgenic mice injected with B 16 F 10 <b>hygro</b> developed lung tumors exclusively.

40|$|Recombination {{occurs at}} high {{frequencies}} in all examined retroviruses. The previously determined homologous recombination rate in one retroviral replication cycle is 4 % for markers 1. 0 kb apart in spleen necrosis virus (SNV). This {{has often been}} used to suggest that approximately 30 to 40 % of the replication-competent viruses with 7 - to 10 -kb genomes undergo recombination. These estimates {{were based on the}} untested assumption that a linear relationship exists between recombination rates and marker distances. To delineate this relationship, we constructed three sets of murine leukemia virus (MLV) -based vectors containing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo) and the hygromycin phosphotransferase B gene (<b>hygro).</b> Each set contained one vector with a functional neo and an inactivated <b>hygro</b> and one vector with a functional <b>hygro</b> and an inactivated neo. The two inactivating mutations in the three sets of vectors were separated by 1. 0, 1. 9, and 7. 1 kb. Recombination rates after one round of replication were 4. 7, 7. 4, and 8. 2 % with markers 1. 0, 1. 9, and 7. 1 kb apart, respectively. Thus, the rate of homologous recombination with 1. 0 kb of marker distance is similar in MLV and SNV. The recombination rate increases when the marker distance increases from 1. 0 to 1. 9 kb; however, the recombination rates with marker distances of 1. 9 and 7. 1 kb are not significantly different. These data refute the previous assumption that recombination is proportional to marker distance and define the maximum recombining population in retroviruses...|$|E
40|$|Retroviruses contain two {{complete}} viral genomic RNAs in each virion. A {{system to}} study in a single round of replication the products of virions with two different genomic RNAs was established. A spleen necrosis virus-based splicing vector containing both the neomycin-resistance gene (neo) and the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (<b>hygro)</b> was used. Two frameshift mutants were derived from this vector such that the neo and the <b>hygro</b> genes were inactivated in separate vectors. Thus, each vector confers resistance to only one selection. The vectors with frameshift mutations were separately propagated and were pooled to infect DSDh helper cells. Doubly resistant cell clones were isolated, and viruses produced from these clones were used to infect D 17 cells. This protocol allowed virions containing two different genomic RNAs (heterozygotes) to complete one round of retroviral replication. The molecular nature of progeny that conferred resistance to single or double selection and their ratio were determined. Our data demonstrate that each infectious heterozygous virion produces only one provirus. The rate of retroviral recombination is approximately 2 % per kilobase per replication cycle.

Adventitious shoot regeneration initiated from leaf margins and maximum of 5. 11 shoots per explant were induced on MS medium contain-ing 1. 0 mg/l BA. After 6 weeks of culture. explants were transferred to culture medium supplemented with 0. 50 - 2. 50 mg/l BA plus 1. 0 mg/l Gibberellic acid (GA 3) for shoot elongation and multiplication.

40|$|Retroviruses mutate at a {{high rate}} during replication. We used a spleen {{necrosis}} virus-based vector system and helper cell line to characterize mutations occurring during a single round of retrovirus replication. The vector used, JD 216 HyNeo, codes for two drug resistance genes, hygromycin resistance (<b>hygro)</b> and neomycin resistance (neo). The downstream neo gene is expressed only when a mutation alleviates a block to splicing which {{is located in the}} upstream <b>hygro</b> gene. The mutations allowing splicing were large deletions, ranging in size from about 500 to about 2, 000 bp. Most of the mutant proviruses lacked the encapsidation sequence, as shown by our inability to rescue the mutant proviruses with wild-type reticuloendotheliosis virus strain A and confirmed by Southern blotting and direct DNA sequence analysis. We therefore concluded that most of the deletions arose during reverse transcription in the target cell, rather than during transcription in the host cell. The sequence data also indicated that the deletions occurred by at least three different mechanisms: (i) misalignment of the growing point; (ii) incorrect synthesis and termination in the primer-binding sequence during synthesis of the plus-strand strong-stop DNA; and (iii) incorrect synthesis and termination before the primer-binding sequence during synthesis of the plus-strand strong-stop DNA. The second mechanism also led to the incorporation of cellular sequences into the proviral genome, pointing to a potential novel mechanism by which retroviruses can acquire cellular genes...|$|E

The plating efficiency of hygromycin-resistant MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells after transfection of pSV 2 <b>hygro</b> were also {{increased by more than}} three fold with the cotransfection of p 53 val 135 and the efficiency was also decreased 0. 2 fold by cotransfection of p 53 -wt. These indicate that p 53 val 135 enhances and p 53 -wt suppresses not only oncogene focus formation but also the cellular growth of the murine MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell line. Southern blot hybridization detected the tran-sfected p 53 -wt sequence only in three out of ten MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell lines established from foci induced by p 53 -wt and oncogenes, and failed to detect the p 53 -wt DNA in hygromycin-resistant MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell lines transfected with pSV 2 <b>hygro</b> and p 53 -wt. These suggest that MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells containing p 53 -wt are at a dis-advantage to form transformed foci or colonies, and suggests that MC 3 T 3 -E 1 provides a good in vitro system to test the biological activity of murine wild-type and mutant p 53 genes...|$|E

A unique feature of the present model is to incorporate the effect of <b>hygro</b> and thermal stresses into actual three-dimensional fuel cell model.

The model is shown {{to be able to}} understand the many interacting, complex electrochemical, transport phenomena, and stresses distribution that have limited experimental data. The results show that the non-uniform distribution of stresses, caused by the temperature gradient in the cell, induces localized bending stresses, which can contribute to delaminating between the membrane and the gas diffusion layers. These results may explain the occurrence of cracks and pinholes in the membrane during regular cell operation. This model is used to study the effect of operating, design, and material parameters on fuel cell hygro-thermal stresses in polymer membrane, catalyst layers, and gas diffusion layers. Detailed analyses of the fuel cell durability under various operating conditions have been conducted and examined. The analysis helped identifying critical parameters and shed insight into the physical mechanisms leading to a fuel cell durability under various operating conditions. Optimization study of a PEM fuel cell durability has been performed.

40|$|Dwarf <b>hygro</b> (Hygrophila polysperma) is an {{ornamental}} {{aquatic plant}} that changes its leaf colours to pinkish in high light. It {{is listed as}} a medicinal plant in medicinal plant lists of Indian states of West Bengal and Karnataka. It is also used as a screening tool for toxicities and a bioindicator to detect and control algae. The study reported in vitro adventitious shoot regeneration from leaf explants cultured on MS medium containing 0. 10 – 1. 60 [*]mg/L Kin/TDZ with or without 0. 10 [*]mg/L IBA and 500 [*]mg/L Amoklavin to eradicate endogenic bacterial contamination. Direct adventitious shoot regeneration started within one week from both culture mediums followed by late callus induction which was more prominent on TDZ containing media compared to Kin containing media. Addition of 0. 10 [*]mg/L IBA with both Kin and TDZ increased shoot regeneration frequency, mean number of shoots per explant, and mean shoot length. Maximum number of 16. 33 and 20. 55 shoots per explant was obtained on MS medium containing 0. 80 + 0. 10 [*]mg/L Kin-IBA and 0. 10 + 0. 10 [*]mg/L TDZ-IBA, respectively. Regenerated shoots were rooted on MS medium containing 0. 20 – 1. 00 [*]mg/L IBA followed by successfull acclimatization in aquariums. Regenerated plantlets were also tested in jars containing distilled water that showed the pH 6 – 9 for the best plant growth and development...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the large}} group of Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERa) -negative breast cancer patients, there is a {{subgroup}} carrying the phenotype ERa 2,PR 2, and Her 2 2, named accordingly ‘‘Triple-Negative’ ’ (TN). Using cell lines derived from this TN group, we wished to establish cell clones, in which ERa is ectopically expressed, forming part of a synthetic lethality screening system. Initially, we generated cell transfectants expressing a mono-cistronic ERa transcription unit, adjacent to a separate dominant selectable marker transcription unit. However, the yield of ERa expressing colonies was rather low (5 – 12. 5 %), and {{only about half of}} these displayed stable ectopic ERa expression over time. Generation and maintenance of such cell clones under minimal exposure to the ERa ligand, did not improve yield or expression stability. Indeed, other groups have also reported grave difficulties in obtaining ectopic expression of ERa in ERa-deficient breast carcinoma cells. We therefore switched to transfecting these cell lines with pERa-IRES, a plasmid vector encoding a bicistronic translation mRNA template: ERa Open Reading Frame (ORF) being upstream followed by a dominant-positive selectable marker (<b>hygro</b> R) ORF, directed for translation from an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES). Through usage of this bicistronic vector linkage system, it was possible to generate a very high yield of ERa expressing cell clones (50 – 100 %). The stability over time of these clones was also somewhat improved, though variations between individual cell clones were evident. Our successful experience wit...|$|E
40|$|Protein-protein {{interactions}} are {{a hallmark of}} all essential cellular processes. However, many of these {{interactions are}} transient, or energetically weak, preventing their identification and analysis through traditional biochemical methods such as co-immunoprecipitation. In this regard, the genetically encodable fluorescent proteins (GFP, RFP, etc.) and their associated overlapping fluorescence spectrum have revolutionized our ability to monitor weak interactions in vivo using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) 1 - 3. Here, we detail our use of a FRET-based proximity assay for monitoring receptor-receptor interactions on the endothelial cell surface. Protocol The protocol consists of three major steps. The first, step cloning of your gene of interest into a mammalian expression vector amino-terminally to the monomeric versions of CFP and/or YFP will only be discussed briefly. The second and third steps; transfection of vector DNA into EA. hy 926 endothelial cells, and confocal imaging with FRET, are outlined in more depth below. 1. Construction of CFP and YFP Chimeric Receptors Receptors of interest should be cloned amino-terminally to monomeric enhanced versions of CFP and YFP. Determination of FRET is empirical and is critically dependent upon the length of linker between the transmembrane spanning region and start of the fluorophore 1. Therefore, several different lengths of linker must be explored for each new receptor pair under investigation. 1. Into the pcDNA 3. 1 <b>hygro</b> R or neo R vector containing monomeric C- or YFP (this vector {{can be obtained from}} our lab), clone your receptor o...|$|E
40|$|Glyoxalases are {{involved}} in a ubiquitous detoxification pathway. In pursuit of {{a better understanding of the}} biological function of the enzyme. the recombinant glyoxalase I (LdGLOI) protein has been characterized from Leishmania donovani, the most important pathogenic Leishmania species that is responsible for visceral leishmaniasis. A 24 kDa protein was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. LdGLOI showed a marked substrate specificity for trypanothione hemithioacetal over glutathione hemithioacetal. Antiserum against recombinant LdGLOI protein could detect a band of anticipated size similar to 16 kDa in promastigote extracts. Several inhibitors of human GLOI showed that they are weak inhibitors of L. donovani growth. Overexpression of GLOI gene in L. donovani using Leishmania expression vector psp alpha <b>hygro</b> alpha, we detected elevated expression of GLOI RNA and protein. Comparative modelling of the 3 -D structure of LDGLOI shows that substrate-binding region of the model involves important differences compared to the homologues, such as E coli, specific to glutathione. Most notably a substrate-binding loop of LDGLOI is characterized by a deletion of five residues compared to the E coli homologue. Further, a critical Arg in the E coli variant at the substrate-binding site is replaced by Tyr in LDGLOI These major differences result in entirely different shapes of the substrate-binding loop and presence of very different chemical groups in the substrate-binding site of LDGLOI compared to E coli homologue suggesting an explanation for the difference in the substrate specificity. Difference in the substrate specificity of the human and LDGLOI enzyme could be exploited for structure-based drug designing of selective inhibitors against the parasite...|$|E
