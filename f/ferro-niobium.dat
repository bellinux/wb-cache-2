40|$|In {{the present}} research, to form niobium carbide coating {{on the surface}} of AISI L 2 steel Thermo-Reactive Deposition method (TRD) in a molten bath was used. Niobium carbide coating {{treatment}} was carried out at 1173 K, 1273 K, and 1373 K for 2, 4, and 8 hours. The molten bath contained 20 wt. % borax (Na 2 B 4 O 7), 5 wt. % boric acid (B 2 O 3), and 75 wt. % <b>ferro-niobium.</b> The presence and properties of the coated layer were studied by means of Optical Microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis. The thickness of coating ranged between 6. 6 µm to 33 µm depending on treatment time, and temperature. The effects of treatment time and temperature on the coating thickness were studied. Kinetic study of the formation of NbC coating showed that growth of the coating is under the control of diffusion. The activation energy of the process was estimated to be 122 kJ/mol. A practical formula to estimate the coating thickness was suggested...|$|E

Thermo-diffusion {{coatings}} containing Nitrogen, Carbon and Niobium (N+C+Nb) on AISI D 2 steel {{have been}} carried out by an initial tufftriding process followed by saturation with Niobium. The properties of the diffusion layer, namely microstructure, phase composition and micro-hardness of the Niobium carbonitride layer, have been studied. The influence of treatment time of Niobizing on the thickness of the metallized layer and its phase composition has been studied. Nitriding treatment was performed at 575 °C for 2 h. Then, the Niobizing treatment was performed by pack method in the powder mixture consisting of <b>ferro-Niobium,</b> ammonium chloride and alumina at 1000 °C for 1 – 4 h. The phases formed on the Niobium carbonitride coated steel were NbN and NbC, confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The longer the treatment times, the thicker the Niobium carbonitride layer became. The thickness of Niobium carbonitride layer was changing between 6. 53 µm and 17. 45 µm, depending on treatment time and temperature. The microhardness of Niobium carbonitride layer formed on the AISI D 2 steel was changing between 2132 ± 203 and 2814 ± 245 HV 0. 01 from surface to interior...|$|E
40|$|The Fen Complex {{which is}} {{situated}} {{in the south of}} Norway, represents a magmatic bedrock area enriched in thorium (Th), iron (Fe), niobium (Nb) and rare earth elements (REE), and is well known for the elevated levels of natural ionizing radiation. This area has been of public interest from the 17 th century when Fe mining started in the central wooded zone of the Fen Complex. Intensive mining of Fe continued until the 20 th century, while mining and the production of <b>ferro-niobium</b> were conducted at the site Søve {{in the western part of}} the Complex in 1950 s. Recently, intensive focus has been directed to the estimated large quantities of Th and REE ores, their value and possibility for future use, but also to environmental issues linked to the legacy enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) in the area. Many studies investigating different aspects of specific bedrock geology, as well as human health risk related to elevated ionizing radiation levels in the area, have been published. Still, no comprehensive investigation of different environmental compartments and radionuclides impact on biota at both legacy enhanced and undisturbed NORM sites in the Fen Complex has been undertaken. The present work was initiated as an integrated ecological and human impact assessment whose main objectives were to assess the possible radionuclide and trace elements contamination of the Fen Complex environment, impact on biota and radiation doses to humans due to outdoor radiation exposure. The Fen Complex area which is comprised of both legacy NORM and undisturbed 232 Th-rich sites served as a natural laboratory where environmental compartments and biota could be investigated in the natural state, under realistic conditions. With respect to the specific Fen area and previously published data, the main focus of this work was on radionuclides such as 232 Th and uranium (238 U) and their progenies, as well on trace elements such as arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb). The generated data provided information on the current environmental status at both undisturbed and legacy NORM sites in the area, and could be used in planning of eventual remediation activities or for future monitoring. To assess the impact of radionuclides and trace elements on the ecosystem and humans, information was needed regarding the characterization, mobility and biological uptake of radionuclides and trace elements, as well as their different exposure pathways. These aspects were studied and presented in five scientific papers on which this thesis is based on...|$|E
