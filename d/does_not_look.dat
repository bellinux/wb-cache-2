5|$|Hector and Tabitha leave. Katy is spooked by the house, {{especially}} when she finds a stuffed cat on the sofa. She sees an old photograph of Hector, Tabitha and Andras as children, but Andras <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> disabled. Katy's friend Shell arrives and plays with Hector's stairlift, sending it upstairs. Katy warns Shell not to break anything, and is startled to see the now-live cat. Katy tries to call her father so she can leave, but the house has no mobile phone signal and the house phone's party line is tied up. As she prepares to leave, the stairlift returns downstairs and Andras's bell rings. Katy is scared of going upstairs, but, at Shell's insistence, the two go to check on him.|$|E
60|$|Well, my friends, and {{the very}} danger of these spiritual temptations is-- that they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like temptations. They <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> ugly, absurd, wrong, they look pleasant, reasonable, right.|$|R

He closed his eyes, and she wiped his cheeks and his mouth. Still he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> at her. She bent very close to him, feeling her heart crushed with grief for him.|$|R
5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E
25|$|Ursa Minor is not {{the only}} {{constellation}} that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> very much like what it represents; very few do. This has led to nicknames for some of the constellations. These nicknames are another variety of asterism. A glance at the stick-figures shown in the charts under the constellation names will easily explain the origin of these asterisms.|$|E
25|$|At first glance, {{the primary}} {{sequence}} of PA <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> {{like that of}} a membrane-spanning protein. A hydrophobicity plot lacking any patterns which are common to possible membrane-spanning domains. The structures of other multimeric membrane proteins (such as diphtheria toxin) provide the answer to how PA manages to span the membrane. It is thought that PA acts like these multimeric membrane proteins that form β-barrels made from stretchs of both polar and non-polar amino acids from each monomer.|$|E

25|$|A second Metro {{line from}} Laajasalo via Kamppi to Pasila {{north of the}} city centre, and {{possibly}} onwards to Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, is also in the planning stages. This is being taken into consideration in city plans and has been discussed by the city assembly, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> likely to be seriously planned before the mid-2030s at the earliest. To prepare for this eventuality, a platform level for a crossing line was already excavated during the original construction of the Kamppi station.|$|E
25|$|Unkei's Miroku Butsu {{is in the}} {{tradition}} of previous Buddha figures, including those of his father and ultimately Tori Busshi. Like the works of those sculptors, the Buddha is depicted as seated and backed by an intricate halo. However, Unkei's work features further strides toward realism. Crystal inlays cause the eyes to shine, and details are carved deeply and in new detail. Furthermore, Unkei's work does not follow the canon of proportions established by Jōchō in the Heian period. Unkei's figure instead has a long torso that does not match the distance between the figures knees (a style used by sculptors for the preceding 150 years). Despite this, Unkei's Buddha <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> unbalanced or unwieldy. Rather, it is a lifelike Buddha who seems kind and empathic. In essence, Unkei created a new style of sculpture.|$|E
25|$|Jake, Riggan's {{best friend}} and lawyer, is {{producing}} the play which co-stars Riggan's girlfriend Laura and Broadway débutante Lesley. Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering drug addict whom {{he is trying to}} reconnect with, is working as his assistant. The day before the first preview, a light fixture falls onto Riggan's hopeless co-star Ralph, which Riggan tells Jake he caused. At Lesley's suggestion, Riggan replaces Ralph with her boyfriend, the brilliant but volatile method actor Mike Shiner. The first previews are disastrous: Mike breaks character over the replacement of his gin with water, attempts to have real sex with Lesley during a sex scene and claims that the prop gun <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> real which is hindering his performance. Riggan clashes continually with Mike and is incensed at influential theater critic Tabitha Dickinson's praise for Mike's performance, but Jake persuades him to continue with the play. Riggan catches Sam using marijuana and berates her; she tells him he is expendable and that his play is a vanity project.|$|E

30|$|Iteration {{procedures}} in fixed point theory {{are led by}} considerations in summability theory. For example, if a given sequence converges, then we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> for the convergence of the sequence of its arithmetic means.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, as {{expected}} Janus {{is present in}} region I of Martianus Capella's division of Heaven and in region XVI, the last one, {{are to be found}} the Ianitores terrestres (along with Nocturnus), perhaps to be identified in Forculus, Limentinus and Cardea, deities strictly related to Janus as his auxiliaries (or perhaps even no more than concrete subdivisions of his functions) as the meaning of their names implies: Forculus is the god of the forca, a iugum, low passage, Limentinus the guardian of the limes, boundary, Cardea the goddess of hinges, here of the gates separating Earth and Heaven. The problem posed by the qualifying adjective terrestres earthly, can be addressed in two different ways. One hypothesis is that Martianus's depiction implies a descent from Heaven onto Earth. However Martianus's depiction <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> to be confined to a division Heaven-Earth as it includes the Underworld and other obscure regions or remote recesses of Heaven. Thence one may argue that the articulation Ianus-Ianitores could be interpreted as connected to the theologem of the Gates of Heaven (the Synplegades) which open on the Heaven on one side and on Earth or the Underworld on the other.|$|E

[...] Love neither rules, nor is it unmoved; also {{it is a little}} oblivious as to morals. [...] It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> to the future; for it finds its own reward in the immediate present." ...|$|E
500|$|Coghill {{was cast}} as Tony on 20 June 2008. He deemed {{the role the}} most {{challenging}} he had ever played, but hoped that it would help to raise public awareness of child abuse. Of his off-screen relationship with McGarty, Coghill explained that it helped that she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> or act like a young child, deeming her [...] "fantastic to work with", as well as [...] "very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress", commenting: [...] "There isn't any uncomfortable feeling at all." [...] Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008.|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} marks {{a departure}} from conventional and contemporary European epitaphs by placing the saints and mortal donor within the same pictorial space. Van der Paele kneels {{to the right of}} the Virgin and Child and seems a somewhat distracted and absent-minded figure. This is intentional, an indication that he is, in the words of art historian Bret Rothstein, [...] "disconnected from the perceptible world", and fully absorbed in the spiritual realm. This notion is reinforced by his glasses which, although they imply education, wealth and learning, also allude to fallibility of the human, earthly senses. In keeping with the conventions of late medieval art, van der Paele <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> directly at any of the heavenly figures, but stares into the middle distance, observing social and spiritual decorum.|$|E
500|$|Trescothick {{began the}} 2014 season strongly. He scored 112 in a warm-up game against Middlesex, {{followed}} by 95 against a university team. Subsequent scores of 20, 17 and {{five in the}} next three innings prompted George Dobell of ESPNcricinfo to comment that [...] "Trescothick <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> anything like the batsman he once was," [...] but he returned to form on 28 April with a further century against Sussex. It was his first in the County Championship since 2012, and was followed on 22 May with a second hundred, against Durham at Taunton. This century came 618 days after the last time he scored a hundred at his home ground. He passed 1,000 runs for the season on 25 September against Yorkshire, in the final game of the year's County Championship.|$|E

Jim {{does not know}} what a rundown is, but is too embarrassed to ask because he has been making such a poor {{impression}} with Charles.

When he finally finishes what he believes is a rundown, Charles <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> at it and simply asks Jim to fax it to everyone on the distribution list. Jim {{does not know what}} the distribution list is either, but rather than asking Charles, he simply faxes the rundown to his father.|$|E

500|$|Square Enix {{had changed}} its mind, {{and no longer}} liked the Nordic style of this {{spin-off}} game, so a last-minute style change was attempted. [...] The game {{had been such a}} well-guarded secret, and had been through so many changes, that most employees did not know they had been working on a Final Fantasy game until very late in development. Grin attempted to change the art style to fit more with traditional Final Fantasy games, but still did not receive any positive feedback. In response, Grin sent Square Enix an image of one of the latter's own games, Final Fantasy XII, and were told that it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like a game in Final Fantasys style. Following that exchange, Grin {{came to the conclusion that}} there was no longer any way to satisfy the publisher.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Bush, in {{her book}} Myth-X, noted that the oil {{platform}} is named [...] "Galpex-Orpheux", {{a reference to the}} ancient Greek religious and mythological figure Orpheus, who was a legendary musician, poet, and prophet. According to the myth, Orpheus's wife Eurydice was killed by a serpent. Hades, the god of the underworld—after hearing Orpheus' moving music—allowed Orpheus to retrieve his wife as long as he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> back at her until they are safely out of the underworld. Orpheus fails, and his wife's soul slips back into the underworld. Bush compared Orpheus's otherworldly singing to the [...] "broadband signal which is the catalyst for the events on the rig". In the episode, Mulder, Doggett, and the two Huecha Indians [...] "wreck havoc" [...] because of their fear, and the [...] "black oil slips back to the underworld".|$|E
500|$|An intense {{performer}} on {{the playing}} field, Youkilis {{was known for his}} scrappiness, grittiness, dirt-stained jerseys, home-plate collisions, and his strange batting stance.

He was called [...] "roly-poly" [...] by his high school coach, [...] "pudgy" [...] by his college coach, a [...] "fat kid" [...] by general manager Billy Beane, and a [...] "thicker-bodied guy" [...] by the Red Sox scout who recruited him. As Jackie MacMullan wrote for the Boston Globe: [...] "He <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like an MVP candidate; more a refrigerator repairman, a butcher, the man selling hammers behind the counter at the True Value hardware store."
