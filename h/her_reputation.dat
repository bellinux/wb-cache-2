5|$|The two {{exchange}} wits; Jessica requests that Dain {{send her}} brother back to England {{in exchange for}} a valuable religious icon she will sell him, while Dain wants the icon or else he will destroy <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> and ruin her brother. They reach an impasse, and while <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> remains intact, Dain spends the week personally overseeing Bertie's disintegration from excessive drinking and gambling. Jessica angrily confronts him and the two unexpectedly kiss. Later, at a party they almost consummate their relationship before being discovered by other party-goers. Dain coldly departs, assuming Jessica invited the others to force him to honorably marry her, leaving her angry that he would leave <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> in tatters so casually.|$|E
5|$|However, {{it is for}} her tumultuous {{love life}} that she is {{primarily}} known from the Renaissance. <b>Her</b> <b>reputation</b> {{was based on the}} bias of the Romans to the Eastern princesses, like Cleopatra or later Zenobia.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau was popularly {{seen as a}} spendthrift {{and irresponsible}} philanderess. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries historians re-examined the {{extensive}} chronicles of her lifetime, concluding that many elements of <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> were unearned and stemmed from factionalism and propaganda.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s and '80s, the {{communist}} censorship attempted to conceal <b>her</b> international <b>reputation.</b> <b>Her</b> works were banned in Czechoslovakia, and the catalogues {{for the exhibition}} Pilgrims in the Victoria and Albert Museum were lost {{on their way to}} Czechoslovakia.|$|R

5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower {{published}} a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> {{for almost a}} century. However, {{with the emergence of}} the feminist movement {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E
5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show {{what she could}} do – which in reality was {{far more than the}} vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1940s, Turner {{established}} {{herself as a}} leading actress in such films as Johnny Eager (1941), Honky Tonk (1941), Ziegfeld Girl (1941), and Somewhere I'll Find You (1942). She appeared in the 1941 horror film Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> as a glamorous femme fatale was enhanced by her performance in the film noir The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946). Her popularity continued through the 1950s in such films as The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) and Peyton Place (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, Ferrier {{made her}} stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later {{she made her}} first {{appearance}} as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United States between 1948 and 1950 and her many visits to continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Procter was the {{favourite}} poet of Queen Victoria. Her poetry {{went through}} numerous editions in the 19th century; Coventry Patmore called {{her the most}} popular poet of the day, after Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Her poems were set to music and made into hymns, and {{were published in the}} United States and Germany as well as in England. Nonetheless, by the early 20th century <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> had diminished, and few modern critics have given her work attention. Those who have, however, argue that Procter's work is significant, in part for what it reveals about how Victorian women expressed otherwise repressed feelings.|$|E
5|$|Riley renewed his {{relationship}} with Bottsworth for a third and final time in 1883. The two corresponded frequently and had secret lovers' rendezvous. He stopped visiting other women and their relationship became more dedicated and stable. Bottsworth, however, became convinced Riley was seeing another woman, and they terminated their relationship in January 1885. Riley's sister, Mary, had become {{a close friend of}} Bottsworth and scolded him for his mistreatment of her. <b>Her</b> <b>reputation</b> was tarnished by the affair and she found it difficult to find employment once their relationship ended.|$|E

5000|$|In all {{the plays}} Quickly is characterised {{as a woman}} with strong links to the {{criminal}} underworld, but who is nevertheless preoccupied with <b>her</b> own respectable <b>reputation.</b> <b>Her</b> speech is filled with malapropisms, double entendres and [...] "bawdy innuendo".|$|R
5|$|The {{turning point}} in her acting career came in December 1947, when she {{appeared}} as Galileo's daughter Virginia in the New York production of Bertolt Brecht's play Galileo, starring Charles Laughton {{in the title role}} and directed by Joseph Losey. Unlike her previous roles, Galileo was a straight dramatic role with no dancing. The play helped establish <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> as a legitimate actress. She also studied acting with Sanford Meisner and Herbert Berghof at the Neighborhood Playhouse.|$|E
5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print {{half a century}} later, and <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books {{paved the way for}} other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr ("the galloping gourmet"), and Robert Carrier.|$|E
5|$|Amy Dudley's death {{caused a}} scandal. Despite the inquest's outcome, Robert Dudley was widely {{suspected}} to have orchestrated his wife's demise, a view {{not shared by}} most modern historians. He remained Elizabeth's closest favourite, but with respect to <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> she could not risk a marriage with him. A tradition that Sir Richard Verney, a follower of Robert Dudley, organized Amy Dudley's violent death evolved early, and Leicester's Commonwealth, a notorious and influential libel of 1584 against Robert Dudley, by then Earl of Leicester, perpetuated this version of events. Interest in Amy Robsart's fate was rekindled in the 19th century by Walter Scott's novel, Kenilworth. The most widely accepted modern explanations of her death have been breast cancer and suicide, although a few historians have probed murder scenarios. The medical evidence of the coroner's report, which was found in 2008, is compatible with accident as well as suicide and other violence.|$|E

5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. <b>Her</b> <b>reputation</b> was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October 1962, Plath {{experienced}} a great burst {{of creativity and}} wrote most of the poems on which <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> now rests, writing at least 26 of the poems of her posthumous collection Ariel during the final months of her life. In December 1962, she returned alone to London with their children, and rented, on a five-year lease, a flat at 23 Fitzroy Road—only a few streets from the Chalcot Square flat. William Butler Yeats once lived in the house, which bears an English Heritage blue plaque for the Irish poet. Plath was pleased by this fact and considered it a good omen.|$|E
5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E
5000|$|Torraco's {{work in the}} New Mexico State Senate gained her notoriety {{and earned}} <b>her</b> a <b>reputation</b> as a risk taker and often {{politically}} courageous.http://www.santafenewmexican.com/opinion/local_columns/it-s-time-for-n-m-s-citizen-legislature-to/article_c0d04f81-5f81-5c8f-92dc-9842bc7732bb.html ...|$|R

50|$|Marjorie Chandler (1897-1983), was a British paleobotanist {{who made}} <b>her</b> own <b>reputation</b> as a {{scientist}} after a long partnership with Eleanor Mary Reid, as a research assistant.|$|R
5|$|From 1950 onwards David {{was well}} known for her {{magazine}} articles and, in the 1960s and '70s, for her kitchen shop, but <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> rested and still rests principally on her books. The first five, published between 1950 and 1960, cover the cuisine of continental Europe and beyond. In the 1970s David wrote two books about English cooking. The last of her books published in her lifetime was a collection of previously-printed essays and articles. From the extensive notes and archives left by the author, her literary executor, Jill Norman, edited and completed four more books that David had planned. Six other books published since the author's death in various formats in hardback and paperback have been compilations drawn from her existing works.|$|E
5|$|Glinda and Elphaba {{meet again}} at the site where Nessarose has been crushed by {{a house with a}} girl named Dorothy inside. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument. The guards arrive, and Elphaba guesses that Glinda {{arranged}} for all of this. Fiyero arrives as well, and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba can escape. Glinda realizes that Fiyero does truly love Elphaba, and tells the guards not to hurt him, but they don't listen as they escort Fiyero to the field where they can interrogate him into revealing where Elphaba has fled to so they can recapture her. Elphaba tries to cast a spell to save his life and protect him from injury, but is frustrated by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> as the Wicked Witch of the West ("No Good Deed").|$|E
5|$|In {{her early}} to mid-thirties, {{she became a}} lady-in-waiting (nyōbō) at court, most likely because of <b>her</b> <b>reputation</b> as an author. Chieko Mulhern writes in Japanese Women Writers, a Biocritical Sourcebook that {{scholars}} have wondered why Murasaki made such a move at a comparatively late period in her life. Her diary evidences that she exchanged poetry with Michinaga after her husband's death, leading to speculation that the two may have been lovers. Bowring sees no evidence that she was brought to court as Michinaga's concubine, although he did bring her to court without following official channels. Mulhern thinks Michinaga wanted to have Murasaki at court to educate his daughter Shōshi.|$|E

50|$|Around 1732, Kitty Raftor married George Clive, a {{barrister}} {{brother of}} Baron Clive. The marriage {{was not a}} success and the two separated, though never officially divorced, and Kitty Clive remained economically independent. Because she never openly took on lovers, Clive {{was able to keep}} her marriage vows and preserve <b>her</b> public <b>reputation.</b> <b>Her</b> good standing with the public helped to strengthen the reputations of actresses in general, who were often looked down upon as morally lax.|$|R
