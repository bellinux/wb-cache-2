The Marines credited 40 percent of intelligence available to the Khe Sanh fire support coordination center to the sensors.

5|$|As one of {{the larger}} towns in the French Basque Country, Bayonne <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main bases of ETA {{organisation}} there. From 1975 onwards this had prompted a reaction from anti-ETA groups. In April 1975, Mugalde, a Basque bookshop in the town, was bombed, though no one was injured. On 25 June 1979, Enrique Gómez Álvarez, an alleged ETA member, was killed by the Batallón Vasco Español (BVE), a right-wing paramilitary group active since 1975.|$|E
5|$|During {{the return}} from the Galápagos through the Sargasso Sea, Beebe once again failed to find the thick mats of Sargassum whose study <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary goals of the expedition. Searching {{for a way to}} satisfy his expedition's donors, Beebe hit upon the idea of documenting the marine life of the Hudson Gorge just beyond the shore of New York City. Applying the same {{techniques}} to studying the Hudson Gorge that he had used in the Galápagos, Beebe encountered a surprising variety of sea animals, many of which had previously been thought to be exclusive to the tropics.|$|E

From 1926, when Lloyd George became leader of the Liberals, Keynes took a major role in defining the party's economics policy, but by then the Liberals had been displaced into third party status by the Labour Party.|$|E
5|$|Khalil al-Banna's wealth {{allowed him}} to take several wives. According to Abu Nidal in an {{interview}} with Der Spiegel, his father had 13 wives, 17 sons and eight daughters.

The family disapproved of the marriage, according to Patrick Seale, and as a result Abu Nidal, Khalil's 12th child, was apparently looked down on by his older siblings, although in later life the relationships were repaired.|$|E

The four largest companies in the city were Mitsubishi Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90% of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90% of the city's industry. Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography {{made it difficult to}} locate at night with AN/APQ-13 radar.|$|E
5|$|The initial concept talks for Final Fantasy VII {{began in}} 1994 at Final Fantasy {{developer}} Square, following {{the completion of}} Final Fantasy VI.

The next installment was initially planned as a 2D game for Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). After creating an early 2D prototype of Final Fantasy VII for the SNES, the team postponed development to help finish Chrono Trigger.|$|E
5|$|The win set {{up another}} rematch for the Giants, {{this time in}} the Super Bowl against the Buffalo Bills. Throughout the 1990 season, the Bills' {{emergence}} as a championship caliber team <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest storylines. The Bills had a cutting edge, no-huddle offense, led by head coach Marv Levy, quarterback Jim Kelly, running back Thurman Thomas, wide receiver Andre Reed and an offensive line led by Kent Hull. They had also recorded a 13–3 record during the 1990 season, culminating with a 51–3 victory over the Los Angeles Raiders in the AFC Championship game. Heading into the game the Bills were installed as seven point favorites.|$|E

The sale was worked out before the Super Bowl but not announced until afterwords, to avoid distracting the team. It {{marked the first time}} since their inception in 1925 that the Giants had not been wholly owned and controlled by the Mara family.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of France, Clouzot and several other {{directors}} were tried in court for collaborating with the Germans. For his sentence, Clouzot was forbidden from going on set of any film or from using a film camera {{for the rest of}} his life. Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot's sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked with one of his supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first people to defend Le Corbeau.|$|E
5|$|Before the kickoff, seven Maryland players, {{including}} six starters, received partial-game suspensions {{for violating the}} team's curfew. Maryland took a quick lead within the first two minutes of play, but repeated errors allowed Nevada to remain competitive and the lead changed hands five times. In the second quarter, Nevada's dual-threat quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, was hobbled by an ankle injury that altered the complexion of the game. Nevertheless, Kaepernick remained in the game for almost its entirety {{and was able to}} scramble for a touchdown. Halfway through the third quarter, Maryland's leading running back, Da'Rel Scott, made his first appearance of the game.

5|$|Britain had {{remained}} neutral throughout the first {{stages of the}} war. Although unsympathetic to the violence and upheaval of the French Revolution, Britain's Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger was unwilling {{to go to war}} alongside the absolutist monarchies of Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, the Royal Navy had made extensive preparations for war should it occur, starting with the Spanish Armament of 1790. The French Atlantic Fleet however was in poor condition: the principal fleet base at Brest in Brittany had been the scene of a significant mutiny in 1790 and by 1791 desertion rates among French naval officers were running at more than 80%. Despite its strong republican politics and command difficulties, the fleet itself was very strong, having been expanded and improved during the 1780s – indeed the tax rises to pay for the French Navy <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> causes of the original Revolution in 1789.|$|E
5|$|Craig was {{selected}} for his first tour of England in 1953 as the last player to make the cut, after only 10first-class matches. The youngest Australian player ever {{to be sent to}} England, Craig was 15months younger than Clem Hill in 1896. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading batsmen of the summer, scoring 867first-class runs at a batting average of 54.18 with seven half-centuries in addition to his double century. This placed him fourth among Australian batsmen for the season in terms of run-scoring, with only leading Test batsman Neil Harvey averaging higher. Craig had a strong preparation before departing for England, scoring fifties in three consecutive matches for the Australians on home soil.|$|E
5|$|Distrust of Charles's {{religious}} policies {{increased with}} {{his support of}} a controversial anti-Calvinist ecclesiastic, Richard Montagu, who was in disrepute among the Puritans. In his pamphlet A New Gag for an Old Goose (1624), a reply to the Catholic pamphlet A New Gag for the New Gospel, Montagu argued against Calvinist predestination, the doctrine that salvation and damnation were preordained by God. Anti-Calvinists – known as Arminians – believed that human beings could influence their own fate through the exercise of free will. Arminian divines <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few sources of support for Charles's proposed Spanish marriage. With the support of King James, Montagu produced another pamphlet, entitled Appello Caesarem, in 1625 shortly after the old king's death and Charles's accession. To protect Montagu from the stricture of Puritan members of Parliament, Charles made the cleric one of his royal chaplains, increasing many Puritans' suspicions that Charles favoured Arminianism as a clandestine attempt to aid the resurgence of Catholicism.|$|E
