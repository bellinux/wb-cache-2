5000|$|Carburettors are {{provided}} with a float chamber to provide a constant hydrostatic head of fuel above the carburettor's <b>metering</b> <b>jets,</b> thus a constant pressure. The float chamber itself does not vary the pressure according to demand, but it does vary the supply flowrate with demand, to keep this pressure constant.|$|R
50|$|When {{the engine}} starts and air {{begins to flow}} through the venturi, the {{pressure}} in the venturi drops according to Bernoulli's principle. This causes the pressure in chamber B to drop. At the same time, air entering the carburetor compresses {{the air in the}} impact tubes, generating a positive pressure based on the density and speed of the air as it enters. The difference in pressure between chamber A and chamber B creates the air metering force which opens the servo valve and allows fuel in. Chamber C and chamber D are connected by a fuel passage which contains the fuel <b>metering</b> <b>jets.</b> As fuel begins to flow, the pressure drop across the <b>metering</b> <b>jet</b> creates the fuel metering force which acts to close the servo valve until a balance is reached with the air pressure and the spring.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Fish carburettor was to avoid {{the problems of the}} float chamber, and its sensitivity to sideways forces from acceleration and cornering. In the conventional carburettor, a venturi in the airflow creates a lowered pressure and this is enough to encourage the flow of fuel through the <b>metering</b> <b>jets.</b> The flow rate is critically sensitive to the fuel pressure at the jet, i.e. the hydrostatic head owing to the depth of fuel between the jet and the float level. Any sloshing within the float chamber affected this. Fish's design kept the float chamber, but avoided the dependency of flow rate on fuel depth. The float chamber was sealed and pressurised by a ram air effect from the air inlet, which then caused fuel to flow through the <b>metering</b> <b>jet.</b> This flow rate was entirely independent of fuel level, but did remain approximately proportional to the mass airflow. The Fish carburettor was also sensitive to mass airflow, rather than volume airflow, making it self-compensating for changes due to temperature or altitude.|$|R
50|$|The 'choke' for constant-depression {{carburettors}} {{such as the}} SU or Stromberg {{does not}} use a choke valve in the air circuit but instead has a mixture enrichment circuit to increase fuel flow by opening the <b>metering</b> <b>jet</b> further or by opening an additional fuel jet or 'enrichment'. Typically used on small engines, notably motorcycles, enrichments work by opening a secondary fuel circuit below the throttle valves. This circuit works exactly like the idle circuit, and when engaged it simply supplies extra fuel when the throttle is closed.|$|R

50|$|Alternative to {{employing}} a power valve, the carburetor may utilize a metering rod or step-up rod system {{to enrich the}} fuel mixture under high-demand conditions. Such systems were originated by Carter Carburetor in the 1950s for the primary two Venturis of their four barrel carburetors, and step-up rods were widely used on most 1-, 2-, and 4-barrel Carter carburetors {{through the end of}} production in the 1980s. The step-up rods are tapered at the bottom end, which extends into the main <b>metering</b> <b>jets.</b> The tops of the rods are connected to a vacuum piston or a mechanical linkage which lifts the rods out of the main jets when the throttle is opened (mechanical linkage) or when manifold vacuum drops (vacuum piston). When the step-up rod is lowered into the main jet, it restricts the fuel flow. When the step-up rod is raised out of the jet, more fuel can flow through it. In this manner, the amount of fuel delivered is tailored to the transient demands of the engine. Some 4-barrel carburetors use metering rods only on the primary two Venturis, but some use them on both primary and secondary circuits, as in the Rochester Quadrajet.|$|R

40|$|The {{two stroke}} engine was {{developed}} to obtain a greater output from the same size of engine. The engine mechanism eliminates the valve arrangement making it mechanically simpler. Theoretically a two stroke engine develops twice {{the power of a}} comparable four stroke engine, thus making it more compact. Getting air into an engine is the key to making power and {{there are many ways to}} increase the air flow into the engine. There are such forced induction, nitrous system, better port and valve shapes to improve flow. But for this study the technique that has been selected were the better port size. The claims that this where the harnessing the inertia of the airs velocity to better fill the cylinders. Modification in intake port is made. Also use of different fuel <b>metering</b> <b>jets</b> is used for different A/F mixtures. At various throttle positions and with torque and speed as input,performance parameters of engine are calculated. Based on the results various performance curves are plotted. The objective of the project is to determine how much power improvement with the modification in intake system in compared to the original intake system. Modification to the engine without additional system attach tothe engine operation were the best solution to have an optimum engine operation in term of torque and horsepower. To optimize the power and intake port flow produce by the engine modification were through avery limited value. The value is limited due to the restricted area of the engine production by the manufacturer. Hence modification must be planned carefully as over modification of the inlet port can end up with a device slower than its stock counterpart...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the newest}} {{technologies}} to produce environmentally friendly energy is to harness wind energy by sending up unmanned gliders that are con- nected to a generator on the ground through a cable. One of the biggest chal- lenges with this technology {{is to keep the}} glider airborne when the wind is still. This thesis work investigated methods to do this by reverse pumping of the cable. Two methods to lift the glider are tried and then compared with each other to see which one is the most energy ecient and the most practical. In method 1 the glider dives with an applied force from the cable and take use of the gained speed to ascend. In method 2 the glider is winched with a constant lead angle. In the descent phase was the trajectory for maximum endurance calculated. A comparable value was found, the energy consumed per <b>gained</b> <b>meter.</b> This showed that method 2 consumed about one sixth of the energy that method 1 did. The whole ight, the ascend and descend phase combined, found out too keep the glider airborne for a sucient time and at a low enough energy cost. This thesis has only looked at the basic mechanics of ight to determine if it was possible to keep the glider airborne by reverse pumping of the cable. To analyze this method more thorough some further analysis is required. This analysis could contain simulation in 3 D, use of real regulation, consideration of weather conditions and also to see the cable as nonlinear...|$|R
