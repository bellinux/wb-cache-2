40|$|Abstract: This study {{discusses}} {{about the}} synthetic fuel made from plastic waste using gasification method. The instrument used {{is a simple}} one phase distillatory. Sample has been tested and analyzed at PT. Pertamina RU V Balikpapan laboratory and Department of Transportation Banjar District. The result shows that this fuel is more alike to diesel fuel type according to its <b>Final</b> <b>Boil</b> <b>Point</b> and density. The smoke result shows that synthetic fuel has 19. 73 % and diesel fuel has 29. 67 %. The gas analyses also showed the carbon monoxide of synthetic fuel is 0 % and the carbon monoxide of diesel fuel is 0. 01 %. Both of smoke and gas analyses test of synthetic fuel are less than diesel fuel. Since the distillation process has been done for four to five hours, and the ratio of plastic bucket waste (PP) and plastic bottle waste (PET) is 3 : 1 (PP:PET) so the pressure vessel capacity is 800 grams. 4000 grams of plastic waste is required to produce 1000 mL of synthetic fuel. The cycle time was approximately 20 hours. The sample testing using ASTM D. 1298 method showed that the fuel condition is good and the density 15 oC of temperature of 0. 8031 g/mL. The result using ASTM D. 85 method shows the Initial <b>Boil</b> <b>Point</b> (IBP) is 60 °C, and the <b>Final</b> <b>Boil</b> <b>Point</b> (FBP) is 345 oC...|$|R

The technique was used to obtain 13 heavy petroleum cuts from three atmospheric residues (ARs) at 673. 15 K and above. The cuts present initial and <b>final</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> between (673. 15 and 951. 15) K. To evaluate {{the efficiency of the}} technique, chemical characterization of residues and distillate cuts, which included SARA fractionation, 13 C NMR, elemental composition, and density and viscosity analysis, was performed. In addition, extended true <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> curves of crude oils by simulated distillation and by molecular distillation were compared. An increase in the viscosity and in the density was observed in all cuts with an increased molecular distillation temperature. Such behavior demonstrates that highly polar components that have a high structural complexity, such as resins and asphaltenes, are concentrated at the higher temperatures of the process. A sensitivity analysis of these two properties, together with the temperature, showed that viscosity and density decreased with increased temperature. On the other hand, the thermal expansion coefficient values obtained were equivalent to those reported in literature for petroleum products. Furthermore, a complete characterization of crude oils was made using the molecular distillation process to extend the true <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (TBP) curves...|$|R
40|$|In an {{industrial}} hydrocracking plant, except to the reactor, the separation section {{can affect the}} accuracy of the developed mathematical model. In this study, two combined-bed six and seven-lump kinetic models for the hydrocracking of vacuum gas oil in a real refinery are developed and their accuracies for the prediction of product yields are compared. In the six-lump model, the engaged components are selected according to the actual products of the plant, but the seven-lump one is included of lumps which are partitioned based on the specified initial and <b>final</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>points.</b> For both approaches, a complete kinetic network with the catalyst-decay functions is considered. It is found that over a 17 -month period of operation from the start of run, the average absolute deviation (AAD%) of the six-lump and the seven-lump models for the yield prediction are 20. 51 % and 5. 21 %, respectively for all products. Additionally, the sum of residuals for the seven-lump model has been appreciably decreased in comparison to the six-lump one. Therefore, it is confirmed that partitioning of the products to the lumps with specific <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> can acceptably decrease the deviation of the prediction.
