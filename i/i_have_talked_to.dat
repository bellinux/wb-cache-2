25|$|I {{suspect that}} I know {{more of the}} English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2002 interview, {{when asked}} if he would work with Jones again, Jackson {{suggested}} he might. But in 2007, when Jones was asked by NME, he said: [...] "Man, please! We already did that. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him about working with him again but I've got too much to do. I've got 900 products, I'm 74 years old." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> some of 'em myself," [...] said Dave. [...] "The Washington {{blacks are}} {{particularly}} faithful. If {{they were set}} free I don't suppose they'd {{know what to do}} with themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear, I believe so. He {{wished to}} see you, too; but I asked his {{permission}} to postpone that till after <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe you're right, old chap," [...] he said, {{extending}} {{his hand to}} the banker, [...] "and <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you before. But it's too late now, and I've given my word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good! And {{you will}} have a {{pleasant}} companion. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Scipione Moratini about it; it did not occur to me that you would go. But it will be all the better to have two of you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not joking, Miss Purcell; are you?" [...] the Colonel said, {{looking at}} her earnestly. [...] "Why, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you a dozen times and it never struck me {{that you were in}} the {{slightest}} degree deaf." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please {{do not be}} long," [...] she whispered. [...] "You {{must admit}} that I have been an admirable dinner companion. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{you all the time}} on your own subject. You must come and talk to me {{presently}} about art." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{can make}} nothing of him," [...] {{continued}} he, [...] "He is perfectly stolid and seems incapable of feeling anything, though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him as I {{never thought to}} have to speak to any son of mine; but he is deaf to all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about is of the utmost importance," [...] said Worthington. [...] "Let us say Saturday night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No, Christina, not to-day,” he said. “To-day <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you seriously. Sit ye down, please, {{there where}} you were. Please!” he repeated.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Christina, not to-day," [...] he said. [...] "To-day <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you seriously. Sit ye down, please, {{there where}} you were. Please!" [...] he repeated.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That at {{any rate}} is well, Paul. And now,--now that we have got back into our old way of talking, tell me what all this means. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> no one after this fashion since we parted. Why should our {{engagement}} be over? You used to love me, did you not?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not to-day, but to-morrow I shall fetch you {{to spend}} the evening with me. Caroline Helstone, if you really are what at present to me you seem, you and I will suit. I have never {{in my whole life}} been able to talk to a young lady as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you this morning. Kiss me--and good-bye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is some {{foundation}} for this, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{some of the}} better class of Welsh; who have, like Glendower, studied in our universities. The Welsh are, above all things, fond of long pedigrees, and can trace, or pretend to trace, the lineage of all their principal families up to Noah; {{and some of them}} admit that there is some ground for the claim Glendower is said to have made.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was. There are two, you know. But {{they don't}} {{mean so much}} to me now. You'd take them for natives anywhere. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them in Samoan." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went up to}} the Hardingham {{through a}} dense London fog to see how things really stood. Before <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> my uncle for ten minutes I felt like a man who has just awakened in a bleak, inhospitable room out of a grandiose dream.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] said Veronica. [...] "I don't {{really mean}} any harm. He's a sailor, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him like that, else he don't know he's being talked to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Unchanged indeed," [...] he answered,--"unchangeable, I think almost that I {{might now}} say. They have been {{wonderful}} months, these last months, Baron," [...] he continued. [...] "I {{have seen some}} of those things which we in Japan have heard about and wondered about all our lives. I have seen the German army at manoeuvres. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> their officers. Where I could, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the men. I have been to some of their great socialist meetings. I have heard them talk about their country and their Emperor, and what would happen to their officers if war should come. I have seen the French artillery. I have been the guest of the President. I have tried to understand the peculiar attitude which that country has always adopted toward us. I have been, unrecognized, in St. Petersburg. I have tried to understand a little the resources of that marvellous country. I came back here in time for the great review in the Solent. I have seen the most magnificent ships and the most splendid naval discipline the world has ever known. Then I have explored the interior of this island as few of our race have explored it before, not for the purpose of studying the manufactures, the trades, the immense shipbuilding industries,--simply to study the people themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{will not}} weary thee. I have looked to that also. Holy One, {{my heart is}} very heavy for my many carelessnesses towards thee.' An hysterical catch rose in his throat. 'I have walked thee too far: I have not picked good food always for thee; I have not {{considered}} the heat; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> people {{on the road and}} left thee alone ... I have--I have ... Hai mai! But I love thee ... and it is all too late ... I was a child ... Oh, why was I not a man? ...' Overborne by strain, fatigue, and the weight beyond his years, Kim broke down and sobbed at the lama's feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Don't hate me any more, Joe. Let my {{children}} stand between us. I {{know what you}} have suffered, and, in all my happiness, the thought of your loneliness has been a trouble, as my husband will tell you. I so often thought of you--a broken, lonely man. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the children of you till they loved the man that saved their mother's life. I cannot give you what you have lost, Joe--no one can do that; but you may make us happy in making you comfortable. At least, if you cannot help hating me, let the love I know you bear {{my children}} weigh with you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said. [...] "That is finished. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{to see you}}. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. Go away, please. I cannot bear to see you any more. It is too terrible--too terrible!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To avert suspicion, most dear Betty. Also <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her of this Peter, in {{whom she}} seems so greatly interested. You are very shrewd, Betty--tell me, {{is that to}} be a match?" ...|$|R
5000|$|I wished <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you —:Just to say goodbye, Bobby Jean ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear boy, I do {{not blame}} you. It {{was the most}} natural thing in the world. I should have looked upon anyone as a madman who had talked to me as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you. But for all that, Robert, you were wrong, and I have never yet in our conversations {{proposed}} any scheme which it was not well within my power to carry out. I tell you in all sober earnest that the amount of my income is limited only by my desire, and that all the bankers and financiers combined could not furnish the sums which I can put forward without an effort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{it is not}} brave," [...] said Lydgate, [...] "but if a man {{is afraid}} of {{creeping}} paralysis?" [...] Then, in another tone, [...] "Yet {{you have made a}} great difference in my courage by believing in me. Everything seems more bearable since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you; and if you can clear me in a few other minds, especially in Farebrother's, I shall be deeply grateful. The point I wish you not to mention is the fact of disobedience to my orders. That would soon get distorted. After all, there is no evidence for me but people's opinion of me beforehand. You can only repeat my own report of myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tonight," [...] he said, [...] "I am {{speaking}} to you as one {{who is willing to}} show everything that is in his heart. I will tell you, then. I have been to Germany, and I can assure you of my own knowledge that Germany possesses the mightiest fighting machine ever known in the world's history. That I do truthfully and honestly believe. Yet listen to me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the men and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the officers. I have seen them in barracks and on the parade ground, and I tell you this. When the time arrives for that machine to be set in motion, it is my profound conviction that the result {{will be one of the}} greatest surprises of modern times. I say no more, nor must you ask me any questions, but I tell you that we do not need Germany as an ally. I have been to Russia, and although our hands have crossed, there can be no real friendship between our countries till time has wiped out the memory of our recent conflict. France hates us because it does not understand us. The future of Japan is just as clear as the disaster which hangs over Great Britain. There is only one possible ally for us, only one possible combination. That is what I have written home to my cousin the Emperor. That is what I pray that our young professors will teach throughout Japan.. That is what it will be my mission to teach my country people if the Fates will that I return safely home. East and West are too far apart. We are well outside the coming European struggle. Our strength will come to us from nearer home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you dread {{the pain}} for him? <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Tom about taking his profession; but the poor boy thinks he dislikes it greatly, though, I believe, his real taste lies that way, and his aversion only arises a few grand notions he has picked up, {{out of which}} I could soon talk him." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{tried to}} collect all the beauty I could, and also all the youth, so {{that for a}} moment I was at a loss. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> many people and {{provided}} for the music, and there were figures in the crowd that were still lost to me. [...] "What old woman do you mean?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{felt the}} {{greatest}} {{respect for the}} captain. Instead of telling us why the ship rolled, he just stopped her rolling. I liked that way of doing things. And I was sure that every one on board that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{would be glad to}} have the vessel lie to, and make herself comfortable until the storm was over.|$|R
60|$|Besides this, {{in order}} to give cavalry {{officers}} as many opportunities of seeing active service as possible, subalterns should be allowed to volunteer for emergency employment with native cavalry. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> several officers who command native cavalry regiments, and they tell me that such an arrangement would work excellently, and that, as they are always short of officers, it would supply a want. I would suggest that subalterns should, with the approval of their colonels, be attached to the native regiment, and after passing in Hindustani and being reported as qualified to serve with the native troops, be considered available for employment as described. I shall be told there are financial difficulties. I do not believe this. There are plenty of cavalry subalterns whose eagerness to see service is so strong, that they would submit to any arrangement that the rapacity of Government might impose. Indeed there is no reason that an actual economy should not be effected. The sums of money that the Indian Government offer, as rewards for officers who can speak Hindustani, have not hitherto tempted many cavalry officers to make a study of the language. Here is an incentive, more powerful and costing nothing.|$|E
60|$|I {{found myself}} {{becoming}} fretful. I know {{a man with}} whom {{it is impossible to}} disagree. Men at the Club--new-comers--have been lured into taking bets that they could on any topic under the sun find themselves out of sympathy with him. They have denounced Mr. Lloyd George as a traitor to his country. This man has risen and shaken them by the hand, words being too weak to express his admiration of their outspoken fearlessness. You might have thought them Nihilists denouncing the Russian Government from the steps of the Kremlin at Moscow. They have, in the next breath, abused Mr. Balfour in terms transgressing the law of slander. He has almost fallen on their necks. It has transpired that the one dream of his life was to hear Mr. Balfour abused. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him myself for a quarter of an hour, and gathered that at heart he was a peace-at-any-price man, strongly in favour of Conscription, a vehement Republican, with a deep-rooted contempt for the working classes. It is not bad sport to collect half a dozen and talk round him. At such times he suggests the family dog that six people from different parts of the house are calling to at the same time. He wants to go to them all at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not that}} I wouldn't trust you," [...] the bishop went on. [...] "I have watched you, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Asa Waring, I have read the newspapers. In spite of it all, you have kept your head, you have not {{compromised}} {{the dignity of the}} Church. But oh, my friend, I beg you to bear in mind that you are launched upon deep waters, that you have raised up many enemies--enemies of Christ--who seek to destroy you. You are still young. And the uncompromising experiment to which you are pledged, of freeing your church, of placing her in the position of power and influence in the community which is rightfully hers, is as yet untried. And no stone will be left unturned to discourage and overcome you. You have faith,--you have made me feel it as you sat here,--a faith which will save you from bitterness in personal defeat. You may not reap the victory, or even see it in your lifetime. But of this I am sure, that {{you will be able to}} say, with Paul, 'I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.' Whatever happens, you may count upon my confidence and support. I can only wish that I were younger, that my arm were stronger, and that I had always perceived the truth as clearly as I see it now." ...|$|E
5000|$|Out [...] - [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{finished}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> you and do {{not expect}} a reply.|$|R
60|$|NICHOLLS (almost brusquely). <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{you from}} the hall. You're silly to take chances just now.|$|R
60|$|D'you mind if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him? <b>I</b> think I {{can save}} you from all that.|$|R
