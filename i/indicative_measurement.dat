40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to carry out a search based on {{available}} literature that focused on historical development of timbered houses in the Czech Republic that are intended for permanent living. A survey was conducted subsequently to this search. This survey concentrated on firms that nowadays build timbered houses and also on construction solutions and structure composition of such houses. The conducted survey describes prevalent construction solutions of timbered houses in the current housebuilding sector of the Czech market. The thesis focuses on thermal properties of today's timbered wooden structures. Next, an <b>indicative</b> <b>measurement</b> of these buildings {{was carried out by}} a blower door test and thermal imaging diagnostics. Furthermore, the thesis compares timbered structures with standard requirements for permanent housing. Interestingly, the measurements for instance showed that one new building met the requirements of the blower door test. Next, several thermography measurements demonstrated seamless heat transfer of a timbered wall as a whole. The conclusion of the thesis summarizes the current use and construction of timbered houses in the Czech Republic. Moreover, it sums up the results of the measurements and outlines the survey results regarding the thermal properties of these houses...|$|E

The objectives of this thesis are {{based on the results of}} Environmental Health System in the Czech Republic (Subsystem III), which provides the long-term monitoring of the noise in the municipal environment of the chosen agglomerations. A part of the noisy location monitoring is also the questionnaire survey confirming hypothesis n. 1 : "At the traffic noise perceiving, there is an important psychosocial bound, which often stands in opposition to the results of the noise measurements". Furthermore, the thesis describes the results of the <b>indicative</b> <b>measurement</b> of the chosen noisy localities in comparison with same locality measurements in the technical accuracy class. The indicative gauge tests were made on the traffic-busy roads in Jihlava city. The measurement has proved the link between the intensity of the traffic flow and indicatively determined noise levels and practical applicability for the local planning or local controlling incentives solution. The results of the indicative measurements point out to breaking of the equivalent night noise levels for sleep disturbance in three chosen localities. Breaking of the equivalent day noise levels has a nature of the noise annoyance. The measured road-traffic-caused night and day noise levels may be compared to the recommendations for the risks of increased incidence of selected civilization diseases published by the World Health Organisation...|$|E

40|$|Higher-order languages, such as Haskell, {{encourage}} the programmer to build abstractions by composing functions. A good compiler must inline {{many of these}} calls to recover an efficiently executable program. In principle, inlining is dead simple: just replace the call of a function by an instance of its body. But any compiler-writer {{will tell you that}} inlining is a black art, full of delicate compromises that work together to give good performance without unnecessary code bloat. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to articulate the key lessons we learned from a full-scale "production" inliner, the one used in the Glasgow Haskell compiler. We focus mainly on the algorithmic aspects, but we also provide some <b>indicative</b> <b>measurements</b> to substantiate the importance of various aspects of the inliner...|$|R

One of its activities is the evaluation of sensors-based measurement systems. In Europe, the monitoring of benzene in ambient air is mandatory as set by the European Directive for air quality (AQD) [1]. This Directive states that the reference method of measurement shall consist of active or on-line sampling followed by gas chromatography [2]. These methods are time consuming, expensive to implement and not easily portable prohibiting more local estimation of the population exposure.

40|$|Automated program repair (APR) has {{attracted}} great research attention, and various techniques have been proposed. Search-based APR {{is one of}} the most important categories among these techniques. Existing researches focus on the design of effective mutation operators and searching algorithms to better find the correct patch. Despite various efforts, the effectiveness of these techniques are still limited by the search space explosion problem. One of the key factors attribute to this problem is the quality of fault spaces as reported by existing studies. This motivates us to study the importance of the fault space to the success of finding a correct patch. Our empirical study aims to answer three questions. Does the fault space significantly correlate with the performance of search-based APR? If so, are there any indicative measurements to approximate the accuracy of the fault space before applying expensive APR techniques? Are there any automatic methods that can improve the accuracy of the fault space? We observe that the accuracy of the fault space affects the effectiveness and efficiency of search-based APR techniques, e. g., the failure rate of GenProg could be as high as 60 % when the real fix location is ranked lower than 10 even though the correct patch is in the search space. Besides, GenProg is able to find more correct patches and with fewer trials when given a fault space with a higher accuracy. We also find that the negative mutation coverage, which is designed in this study to measure the capability of a test suite to kill the mutants created on the statements executed by failing tests, is the most <b>indicative</b> <b>measurement</b> to estimate the efficiency of search-based APR. Finally, we confirm that automated generated test cases can help improve the accuracy of fault spaces, and further improve the performance of search-based APR techniques...|$|E
40|$|Poultry {{housings}} with litter are a {{major contributor}} to fine dust emissions (PM 10 /PM 2. 5) in the Netherlands. Poultry producers are in need of dust mitigation options that are cost effective. Such an option could be provided by adequately designed water scrubbers. Catchment of dust particles by water droplets and deposition of dust particles on the surface of wetted packing material will lead to removal of dust from ventilation air. The aim of this research was to test water scrubbers under real poultry farm conditions. Prototypes of two water scrubber concepts were tested: prototype A was based on treating outlet air in a cross flow scrubbing setup. Synthetic packing material is continuously drained with a specified large volume of water, that is recirculated from a storage basin below. Prototype B was based on spraying of water by high pressure nozzles in an open treatment chamber, through which the ventilated air was led. A drip catcher was constructed at the outlet of this chamber to prevent loss of water. For prototype A an <b>indicative</b> <b>measurement</b> scheme was carried out on a poultry farm with non-productive raising pullets on cages. Four measurements based on 24 h sampling periods were carried out during which dust removal was measured by a gravimetrical method. Mean removal percentages for PM 2. 5 and PM 10 amounted 9 and 62 % respectively. The observed removal percentage for PM 10 was in accordance with an earlier theoretical assessment study. It is concluded that this prototype {{can be used as a}} basis to develop of this water scrubber for use in poultry production. Prototype B was tested on a broiler farm. First measurements based on gravimetrical methods showed negative removal results. To avoid biasing effects of high humidity on the results, subsequent gravimetrical measurements in the outlet air of the scrubber were carried out after heating and drying the outlet air to lower humidity levels. Accompanying particle counter measurement in particle size classes from 1 to 25 micrometer were carried out in both untreated and treated air. PM 10 removal performance was negative, and particle numbers especially increased in the smaller size classes. Inspection of outlet dust samples by electron microscopy indicated that formation of salt aerosols might provide an explanation for this increase. It is concluded in general that humidity effects on dust measurement methods and potential salt crystal formation may complicate dust removal performance of scrubbers and should be more deeply investigated...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{evaluation}} of grain yield formation and state of health {{of the line and}} hybrid wheat. For this target it was founded a one-year small-land experiment on the land of the Faculty of Agriculture of The University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice in September 2014. The experiment had 16 different variants in four repetitions, where the main factor was the different cultivar - Hybrid Hymack and line Tobak were sown at two different dates (early date 20 th September, late date 29 th October). In both of sowing dates, cultivars also differed in amount of seed quantity, where for Hymack it was 1, 1 and 2, 2 MKS/ha and for Tobak it was 3, 5 and 4, 2 MKS/ha. The last option was the stimulation by using the products from the company EGT and checking. During the vegetation, the number of plants per square meter, number of tillers and number of spikes were monitored and the state of health was evalueted. After the harvest were evalueted the grain yield, volume weight, HTZ and the number of grains per spike. The <b>indicative</b> <b>measurement</b> was made by the N - tester and a Sun Scan. The results achieved during the one-year small-land experiment show, that due to the influence of favorable year and high intensity of cultivation, a line cultivar Tobak achieved a higher yield (10, 4 t/ha) compared to hybrid cultivar Hymack (10, 4 t/ha) about 7 %. In the evaluated parameters the biggest difference was in HTZ, when Tobak had 47 grams and Hymack had 43, 5 grams. This difference was the reason for higher yield of the line cultivar. Both of cultivars have achieved a better yield in the early sowing date and responded positively to the application of the growth stimulators. On the contrary, in the late date of sowing, cultivars reached a higher volume weight of the grain. During the growing season, the hybrid cultivar had better state of health and considerably higher tillering capability and the leaf area. The hybrid wheat's yield potential can be applied especially in unfavorable conditions such as drought or poor quality soil. At high intensity of cultivation supported by suitable climatic conditions, hybrid wheat hasn´t got an economic application in comparison with profitable line cultivars. The reason for this, is the high price of the seed and need for higher doses of nitrogen. The hybrid wheats are suitable for unfavorable growing regions with early sowing...|$|E
40|$|Passive {{samplers}} {{provide an}} excellent opportunity to perform <b>indicative</b> <b>measurements</b> or establish a dense network of measuring sites. A drawback compared with conventional active measuring methods is the larger spread of results. This variation can, to a large extent, {{be attributed to the}} influence of temperature, sampler geometry and wind on sampling results. A proper design of sampler geometry and optimum choice of draught shield can reduce the influence of wind velocity on a badge type sampler to less than 10 %. Wire mesh screens prove to be inadequate in damping turbulence. Filters give good results. Attention should be paid to the size and isolation value of the walls of the sampler to prevent thermal updrafts occurring within the sampler. Tube type samplers are less influenced by wind, provided that turbulence is prevented from influencing diffusion within the sampler...|$|R

We {{investigate the}} validity of this claim {{in the context of}} our highly-portable implementation of an implicitly-parallel functional language: the GUM implementation of Glasgow Parallel Haskell (GpH). We discuss architecture independence at two levels: lowlevel (i. e. the implementation) and high-level (i. e. the programmer). Low-level architecture independence is achieved by chosing a message-passing model for GUM, and implementing it using portable C and a widely-supported message-passing library like PVM. In fact GUM is largely independent of the message-passing library, and has been adapted to use MPI and the CM- 5 CMMD libraries as well as PVM. As a result, GUM is easily ported, and is currently available on seven platforms including shared-memory machines, distributed-memory machines, and networks of workstations.

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} of benzene measurements {{obtained by the}} analysis of thermally desorbable Radiello diffusive samplers was evaluated according to the recent standard EN 14662 - 4 (2005). Considering the results of laboratory experiments, all the sources of uncertainty regarding the diffusive sampler method characteristics were accessed for the sampling times of 7 and 14 days. The {{major part of the}} uncertainty budget (> 79 %) was explained by the variation of the sampling rate due to the environmental factors (temperature and concentration level). For weekly sampling, the diffusive sampler method satisfies the data quality objectives of the European Directive to supply the <b>indicative</b> <b>measurements</b> as well as the reference measurement, since the expanded uncertainty is found lower than 25 %. Using a model-predicted sampling rate which depends on the concentration and temperature, the expanded uncertainty is significantly decreased. The Radiello sampler was found to give correct results for weekly sampling provided that the range of benzene concentrations remained between 0 and 10 µg. m- 3, which is generally observed in ambient air monitoring. For 2 -week sampling, the expanded {{uncertainty of}} measurements exceeds 30 %. However, this diffusive sampler can still be used to carry out an objective evaluation of benzene (minimum quality objective for the accuracy of 100 %).

These samplers benefit from new model equations capable of estimating their uptake rate. For O 3, the aim here was to demonstrate the equivalence for the reference period of 8 hours and 120 µg m-³, the target value stated in the 3 rd Daughter Directive. For benzene, the demonstration of equivalence to the annual limit value of 5 µg. m- 3 as stated in the 2 nd Daughter Directive was examined. In the case of NO 2, the equivalence to the annual limit value as stated in the 1 st Daughter Directive (40 µg m-³) was considered. Results show that the radial sampler for O 3 fails to meet the Data Quality Objective (DQO) for continuous monitoring. However, with an expanded uncertainty of less than 30 %, the O 3 diffusive sampler fulfils the DQO for <b>indicative</b> <b>measurements.</b> For benzene, the Radiello sampler exposed for 7 days gave satisfying results showing the ability of the sampler to meet the DQO of the reference method. Nevertheless, the field tests should be complemented by measurements for a wider range of benzene concentrations. In the case of NO 2, all the results of the laboratory and field experiments respected the requirements of the demonstration of equivalence. Overall, these findings thus show that the Radiello sampler and the MCPT are equivalent to the reference methods only for assessment of benzene and NO 2 respectively. JRC.

40|$|Poor {{air quality}} has been {{projected}} to be the world’s top cause of environmental premature mortality by 2050 surpassing poor sanitation and dirty water (IGBP / IGAC press release, 2012). One of the major challenges of air quality management is how to adequately quantify both the spatial and temporal variations of pollutants {{for the purpose of}} implementing necessary mitigation measures. The work described in this thesis aims to address this problem using novel electrochemical based air quality (AQ) sensors. These instruments are shown to provide cost effective, portable, reliable, <b>indicative</b> <b>measurements</b> for urban air quality assessment as well as for personal exposure studies. Three principal pollutants CO, NO and NO 2 are simultaneously measured in each unit of the AQ instrument including temperature / RH measurements as well as GPS (for time and position) and GPRS for data transmission. Laboratory studies showed that the electrochemical sensor nodes can be highly sensitive, showing linear response during calibration tests at ppb level (0 - 160 ppb). The instrumental detection limits were found to be < 4 ppb (CO and NO) and < 1 ppb for NO 2 with fast response time equivalent to t 90 < 20 s. Several field studies were carried out involving deployment of both the mobile and static electrochemical sensor nodes. Results from some short-term studies in four different cities including Cambridge (UK), London (UK), Valencia (Spain) and Lagos (Nigeria) are presented. The measurements in these cities represent snapshot of the pollution levels, the stark contrast between the pollution level especially CO (mean mixing ratio of 16 ppm over 3 hrs) in Lagos and the other three cities {{is a reflection of the}} poor air quality in that part of the world. Results from long-term AQ monitoring using network of 46 static AQ sensors were used to characterise pollution in different environments ranging from urban to semi-urban and rural locations. By coupling meteorological information (wind measurements) with pollution data, pollution sources, and phenomena like the street canyon effect can be studied. Results from the long-term study also revealed that siting of the current fixed monitoring stations can fail to represent the actual air quality distribution and may therefore be unrepresentative.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Measurements</b> <b>indicative</b> of the {{internal}} behavior of full-scale geosyn-thetic-reinforced soil walls typically consist of reinforcement strains and overall defor-mations. The focus {{of this paper is}} the development of a methodology {{that can be used to}} convert measured reinforcement strains to load using properly selected reinforcement stiffness values. The loading of the geosynthetic in the field can be simulated in the lab-oratory using creep, relaxation, and constant-rate-of-strain tests. It was found that in-iso-lation creep stiffness data is sufficiently accurate to estimate reinforcement loads from strain measurements, at least for geogrids and most woven geotextiles. The approach is validated using data from carefully instrumented wall case histories in which reinforce-ment loads were measured directly and compared to loads estimated from measured rein...|$|R

40|$|Gas sensors are {{identified}} as emerging devices for <b>indicative</b> <b>measurements</b> as defined in the European Directive for Air Quality (2008 / 50 /EC, 2008). Compared to reference measurements, gas sensors would allow air pollution monitoring at lower cost. Recent development in sensors platforms mainly focused {{on the use of}} amperometric sensors (Mead et al., 2013 and Castell et al., 2013) because of the high linearity of their response and their limited drift over time. Conversely, this type of sensors suffers from a lack of selectivity that makes especially difficult to distinguish between ozone (O 3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) (Spinelle et al., 2014.). Their wide application is also limited by their relative high price and short life time. On the contrary, Metal Oxides sensors (MOx) can be easily manufactured resulting in a moderate price. Unfortunately, MOx sensors have been shown by experiment to be difficult to calibrate because of their lack of linearity and their dependence on interfering variables as for example temperature and humidity (Gerboles and Buzica, 2009). Moreover, the stability of their calibration function over long period (longer than 100 days) is also a limitation to their applicability in field studies (Spinelle et al., 2015). Conversely, MOx sensors appear to be enough sensitive for monitoring inorganic gases in ambient air (Aleixandre and Gerboles, 2012). In this paper we present an accurate evaluation of MOx sensors including commercial sensors and laboratory prototypes for monitoring O 3 in ambient air at ppb level in order to give quantitative estimation of the effect of several parameters on sensor measurements. The list of sensors consisted of: O 3 Sens 3000 (Unitec – IT), NanoEnvi (Ingenieros Assessores - SP), MiCS 2610 and Oz- 47 (SGX Sensotech - CH), SP- 61 (FIS – JP) and a prototype of WO 3 sensor designed by IMN 2 P (FR). Experiments were conducted in a laboratory exposure chamber and were designed to evaluate several metrological parameters: response time, sensitivity, repeatability, limit of detection, short term drift (over 3 days), long term drift (over more than 100 days), interference from gaseous compounds (NO 2, NO, CO, CO 2, NH 3), differences of sensor values when measuring mixtures diluted with indoor, outdoor or filtered air and the effect of change of temperature and humidity. Additionally, the presence of hysteresis in sensor responses when changing O 3 concentration levels, temperature or humidity was studied. The experimental design follows the Protocol of evaluation of low-cost gas sensors for air pollution (Spinelle et al., 2013). Precise set up of experiments and details of the data treatment are given in this protocol. A discussion of the experimental results allows advising which parameters needs attention, correction or control. An attempt of estimating the sensor measurement uncertainty from laboratory experiment is also carried out. JRC. C. 5 -Air and Climat...|$|R
40|$|Composite resin {{materials}} used in restorative dentistry should closely match the surrounding tooth structure so that the restoration blends with the dental tissue in a natural manner that results to an invisible, aesthetic restoration. The optical properties of the materials are of paramount importance {{as well as the}} proper finishing and polishing of the restoration. Aim : The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the correlation between the color characteristics and the gloss of contemporary composite resin materials available in the market today with their roughness, after different surface treatments. Also, to investigate the effect water aging has on the aforementioned characteristics. Materials and Methods : Disk shaped specimens (10 mm in diameter, 2 mm thick, n= 6 per material) were fabricated from the composite resin materials Ceram-X (Dentsply, DeTrey, Surrey, UK), Herculite XRV (Kerr Co, Orange, CA, USA), Filtek Supreme (3 M,ESPE, St Paul,MN,USA), Premise (Kerr Co, Orange, CA, USA) and Renamel Microfill (Cosmedent Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Consecutive treatments of the specimens were conducted, first with the abrasive system recommended by the manufacturer and then in a metallographic grinding/polishing device. The abrasives used were Enhance (Dentsply, DeTrey, Surrey, UK), Optidisc (Kerr Co, Orange, CA, USA), Soflex (3 M,ESPE, St Paul,MN,USA) and Flexidisc (Cosmedent Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) respectively. Then, the specimens were aged in a water environment for 2 years. At baseline (Mylar strip polymerized - Resin Rich Layer), after each treatment of the surface, and after water aging, measurements of roughness (Ra, Rz, Rq, Rt), color (L*, a*, b*) and gloss (GU) were performed. Roughness was measured with a skid profilometer in four different areas of each specimen after rotating them, resulting in 24 measurements per material. A 3 D optical profilometer was also used to take <b>indicative</b> <b>measurements</b> of roughness (Ra, Rz, Rq, Rt) and images of the specimen surfaces. With the same method, the roughness of the abrasive systems used in this study was also indicatively measured. The optical profilometer was set in VSI function, with an area scan size of 100 μm. Gloss was measured with a small area glossmeter with a square measurement area of 2 x 2 mm and 60 o geometry. The roughness, color and gloss results were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS software (SPSS Inc, IBM Co, IL, USA). Means and standard deviations were calculated for each material on every surface condition. The normality of the data was checked with the Shapiro test and the homogeneity of variances with the Levene test. Statistically significant differences of roughness and gloss through the different surface conditions were obtained using Student’s t - test or Wilcoxon test, depending on the normality of distribution of the data. To test for differences between the materials for each one of the surface conditions, One Way Anova or Kruskal - Wallis test was used [...] . ...|$|R
