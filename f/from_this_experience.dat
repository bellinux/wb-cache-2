5|$|The first {{shipments}} {{took place}} in 1806 when Tudor transported an initial trial cargo of ice, probably harvested from his family estate at Rockwood, to the Caribbean island of Martinique. Sales were hampered, however, {{by the lack of}} local storage facilities, both for Tudor's stock and any ice bought by domestic customers, and as a result the ice stocks quickly melted away. Learning <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>experience,</b> Tudor then built a functioning ice depot in Havana and, despite the U.S. trade embargo declared in 1807, was trading successfully again by 1810. He was unable to acquire exclusive legal rights to import ice into Cuba, but was nonetheless able to maintain an effective monopoly through his control of the ice houses. The 1812 war briefly disrupted trade, but over subsequent years Tudor began to export fruit back from Havana to the mainland on the return journey, kept fresh with part of the unsold ice cargo. Trade to Charleston and to Savannah in Georgia followed, while Tudor's competitors began to supply South Carolina and Georgia by ship from New York or using barges sent downstream from Kentucky.|$|E

50|$|The Armenian {{national}} rugby union {{team has}} recently begun {{playing in the}} European Nations Cup. The team is unexpectedly strong due to the large Armenian diaspora in France (as well as other traditionally strong rugby nations).

The miners had struck in sympathy with the smeltermen, but other unions—notably, craft unions—had not.|$|E

25|$|From 1952 until 1962 Dijkstra {{worked at}} the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam, where he worked closely with Bram Jan Loopstra and Carel S. Scholten, who had been hired to build a computer. Their mode of {{interaction}} was disciplined: They would first decide upon the interface between the hardware and the software, by writing a programming manual. Then the hardware designers {{would have to be}} faithful to their part of the contract, while Dijkstra, the programmer, would write software for the nonexistent machine. Two of the lessons he learned <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>experience</b> were the importance of clear documentation, and that program debugging can be largely avoided through careful design.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, the Rev. Mowry led {{the school}} {{orchestra}} {{in participating in}} the March 1st Movement, a nationwide effort among Koreans to protest against Japanese rule over the Korean peninsula. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>experience,</b> Ahn developed a fervor for the Korean independence movement, and began a student-held movement to protest against pro-Japanese teachers; the school deemed Ahn's actions inappropriate, and punished him accordingly. Sometime in September, Ahn involved himself {{in an effort to}} raid a jail in order to rescue the March 1st Movement activists caught by the Japanese police. When the police raided one of the meetings, Ahn successfully fled to Dr. Mauri's. The doctor treated Ahn's injuries for a week, and, upon receiving requests from the police to surrender Ahn, made a personal visit to the local police station to discuss alternatives. Impressed with Dr. Mauri's character, the department head let Ahn forego imprisonment by forging papers that permitted Ahn to study music in Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} six months of World War II, Bowlby worked at a clinic in Canonbury in the child {{psychiatry}} unit. Later on in the war, Bowlby became a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps, where he conducted research on psychological methods of officer selection (which contributed to the creation of War Office Selection Boards) and where he came into contact with members of the Tavistock Clinic. Alongside his job in the Royal Army Medical Corps, Bowlby explained that he also worked for the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) during the months of May and June in 1940 where he dealt with tragic war neurosis cases. Additionally, the children that were being treated at the Canonbury clinic were evacuated to the child guidance clinic in Cambridge, due to the air raids from the War. Bowlby explained in an interview that he spent time going back and forth from Cambridge to London, where he would see patients in private. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>experience,</b> Bowlby was able to work with several children at Cambridge that were evacuated from London and separated from their families and nannies. This actually extended his research interested on separation that he was focused on pre-war.|$|E

Alan Morrison, {{a former member of}} the regiment, later recalled that for the two battalions that returned to Australia [...] "...the first eighteen months of the regiment's existence were harrowing times".

500|$|Blek {{was built}} for iOS by {{brothers}} Denis and Davor Mikan. While both had coding experience, neither were game developers by trade. This was their first game together as Kunabi Brother. Denis had published short stories and a novel, and Davor released music on a Crónica Electrónica. Davor previously made Flash games and developed the idea for Blek <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>experience.</b> He approached Denis about converting the video game Snake for touchscreens, and Denis returned {{with the idea of}} [...] "a line representing an idea that springs to life after it has been drawn". This thought was likely inspired by the calligraphy and ink drawings in a book by Japanese poet Matsuo Basho that Denis was reading. They had several prototypes by mid-2013, when Davor joined an Parisian artist in residence program, where he felt he was treated differently when he introduced himself as a game developer instead of as a musician. This experience invigorated his interest in the game medium and led to the brothers' push to finish the game over the next six months.|$|E
