This pattern of results demonstrated that acquiring another language modality disadvantages ASL learners.

Thus, updates falling into the same leaf of the B-tree can be performed simultaneously and disk accesses are saved. In this thesis, new batch-update algorithms for B-trees are presented and analyzed. First, an efficient batch-insertion algorithm for a situation where no concurrency control is needed is presented and analyzed. The algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the number of structure modification operations needed to rebalance the tree after the batch insertion. Next, new batch-update algorithms for different types of B-trees such that the batch update can be performed concurrently with other actions are presented. Experimental tests have been performed to compare the new algorithms with an earlier algorithm. According to simulation results, the new algorithms allow much more concurrency than the previous algorithm. Finally, a <b>differential</b> <b>indexing</b> system is presented.

40|$|This study uses a stylised {{simulation}} model to consider potential behavioural {{responses to the}} reduction in pension taper rates associated with replacing the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) with the Pension Credit (PC). A range of long-run responses to the policy change are identified, summarised by four behavioural "types": 1. Households on very low incomes, who do not save any wealth under the MIG — comprising 17 {{percent of the population}} in 2004. The behaviour of these households is affected only slightly by replacing the MIG with the PC. These households do not save for retirement and choose to exit the labour market before state pensionable age because of their low labour incomes (relative to welfare benefits), rather than in response to the effects of means tested pensions. 2. Households (other than those described under 1) for which a marginal increase in savings would be subject to a 100 % taper under the MIG — comprising 12 percent of the population in 2004. Substitution effects dominate with the introduction of the PC, and these households choose to increase their savings for retirement (by £ 11, 000 on average between ages 60 and 64), and to choose a later retirement age (an additional 18 % to 20 % choose to be employed between ages 60 and 64). Interestingly, the increase in government expenditure implied by the reduced taper rates on private income for this population subgroup under the PC is more than off-set by the increase in revenues associated with the subgroup’s increase in savings. The responses of this population group consequently appear to most accurately reflect the suppositions of those who argued for a move away from the MIG. 3. Households (other than those described under either 1 or 2) with sufficient savings under the MIG to generate incomes close to the upper threshold for which benefits can be received under the PC — approximately corresponding to the third population quintile (31 % of the population 1). These households are unambiguously better off under the PC. In the absence of behavioural responses, some of these households would receive a state retirement benefit under the PC where they would not under the MIG, and the PC implies a smaller cost of consumption during the working lifetime than the MIG. Hence, both substitution and income effects motivate these households to reduce their retirement savings (by £ 6, 500 -£ 7, 300 on average between ages 60 and 64), and to take earlier retirement (between 4 % and 7 % fewer choose to be employed between ages 60 and 64) under the PC relative to the MIG. The behavioural responses of these households draw a clear contrast with those described under 2. 4. Households that earn sufficiently high incomes, so that they lie beyond the thresholds of means tested pension benefits under either the MIG or the PC — comprising the fourth, and in particular, highest population quintile (approximately 40 % of the population). As could be expected, these households {{do not appear to be}} much affected by the policy counterfactual considered here. Aggregating the behavioural effects over a population cohort suggests that substitution effects on poorer households will dominate the long-run impact on retirement of the shift from the MIG to the PC, so that an additional 0. 5 - 1. 4 % of the population will choose to supply labour between ages 60 and 64. In contrast, the offsetting savings responses of alternative households produce an insubstantial fall in aggregate population savings. In terms of the long-run budgetary impact of the change from the MIG to the PC, the study supports the view that the reduction in pensions means testing will reduce the reliance on the welfare state. The effect of the policy change on the aggregate Government budget, however, suggests overall budget neutrality. Under the PC, the effects of reduced government expenditure on means-tested benefits, reduced tax receipts from savings and increased tax receipts from working longer all offset one another. This last observation is a key result of the current study, and arises due to an interesting relation between the behavioural responses of lower and middle income households. In the absence of behavioural responses, it is clear that many households in receipt of the MIG would receive a larger state benefit under the PC. Our analysis, however, implies that lower income households will actually impose a smaller burden on the public purse under the PC than they would have under the MIG, because of their responses to the improved incentives to save. This net benefit to the government budget is almost exactly offset in our analysis by the responses of middle income households, who save less and retire earlier under the PC. The finding of budgetary neutrality is important as it suggests that the policy reform is welfare improving, since all households are at least as well off under the PC as they would have been under the MIG, and some are made strictly better off. Sensitivity of the above results to aspects of the policy environment are also reported here, and are summarised in Table 1. This table indicates that reducing means testing beyond the PC by providing a Citizen’s Pension equal to the MIG, exaggerates the behavioural responses of households in the first and second quintiles, increases the consumption (both pre and post retirement) of households above the second quintile, and imposes a higher cost on the public purse. Furthermore, we consider the effects of allowing the PC to extend up the income distribution, as is implied by the <b>differential</b> <b>indexing</b> that is currently applied to the Savings Credit. This analysis suggests that extending the PC up the income distribution will not have a substantial effect on the behaviour of the lowest quintile (as these households are indifferent to policy changes that affect incomes beyond a lower threshold), will reduce the behavioural responses observed for the second quintile (as the range of means tested incomes in retirement is extended), will motivate the third quintile to save and work less (as a larger proportion are subject to means testing), and motivate households in the fourth and fifth quintiles to save more (due to the income effects of a relative fall in the value of the basic state pension). ...|$|E
40|$|The major {{intent of}} the {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} existing level of cost differentials for selected education program categories in the state of Indiana. The categories of prekindergarten and kindergarten, grades one through six, grades seven through-twelve, mentally handicapped, physically handicapped, compensatory and vocational education were selected as program categories for study. Secondary concerns were to describe the patterns of 1971 - 72 public school funding for the state of Indiana by government level and to recommend a new concept for distribution of state funds to Indiana local schools based on the developed program cost differentials. Sources of revenue were taken from Report of Statistical Information for Indiana School Corporations 1971 - 72 School Year for the 1967 - 68, 1968 - 69, 1969 - 70, 1970 - 71, 1971 - 72 school years. Percentages as to major categories of revenue were computed for the above years. The Education Cost Differential Basic Data Instrument was developed for collecting data to achieve the major purpose of the study. Seventy-four Indiana school corporations were sampled from a population of all Indiana reorganized school corporations which had grade organizational patterns of 6 - 6, 6 - 2 - 4, or 6 - 3 - 3 for the school year 1971 - 72. Eighteen responded with timely usable data. State cost differentials for each program were computed by dividing reported net current operating expenditures for each program area by total full time equivalent pupils in ADM for the program. State cost differentials were computed by dividing the average cost per full time equivalent pupil in ADM for each program by the cost per pupil for the basic program, grades one through six. Conclusions of the study included: 1. The major fiscal support for public school corporations in Indiana is provided from localsources. 2. Percentage of the total revenue from local sources has constantly increased for the public school systems from July 1, 1967 through June 30, 1972. 3. The Indiana General Assembly has not provided fiscal support commensurate with the rising costs of public education. 4. Federal support as a percentage of total fiscal support of public education in Indiana is below the national average. 5. Elementary programs, grades one through six, have the lowest net current operating expenditure and were assigned a cost <b>differential</b> <b>index</b> of 1. 000. 6. Secondary programs, grades seven through twelve, represent the second lowest net current operating expenditure with a cost <b>differential</b> <b>index</b> of 1. 095. 7, The cost <b>differential</b> <b>index</b> for vocational education programs is 1. 256. 8. Prekindergarten and kindergarten have a cost <b>differential</b> <b>index</b> of 1. 271. 9. The cost <b>differential</b> <b>index</b> for compensatory education is 1. 633. 10. Mentally handicapped programs have a computed cost <b>differential</b> <b>index</b> of 2. 559. 11. The cost <b>differential</b> <b>index</b> for physically handicapped programs is 2, 821. In comparing Indiana cost <b>differential</b> <b>indices</b> with cost <b>differential</b> <b>indices</b> developed in similar studies but different populations, the vocational index of 1. 256 is indefensibly lower and, therefore, questioned. Only five of the 18 respondents supplying data may account for the variation. The Indiana General Assembly should enact legislation which would provide a distribution formula for state aid to local school districts which weights per pupil allocations based upon program cost indices. The weighted pupil concept could be effectively employed to determine state allocations by multiplying the number of weighted pupils in ADM by a uniform dollar allotment for pupils with an index of 1. 000. The cost of the state guaranteed program, to avoid built-in inequities, should be defined as net current operating expenditures. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the reduction of}} differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems. Modelling of physical or chemical processes often results in an equation system with both differential and algebraic equations. For various applications (e. g. applications in real-time) the simulation time of the model should be sufficiently short, which {{might not be the}} case when the model size is too large. In order to reduce the simulation time, mathematical methods for model reduction are deployed. In this thesis, a new method based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is proposed for the reduction of linear and nonlinear DAE systems which performs better than the POD methods available in literature. The proposed POD method involves a system transformation which separates the DAE system into a dynamic subsystem and an algebraic subsystem before reducing the system by a Galerkin Projection. The connection between the POD reduction method and the balanced truncation reduction method which exists for ODE systems is generalized to DAE systems in this way. Linear DAE systems with an arbitrary <b>differential</b> <b>index</b> can be reduced by the proposed method in contrast to the POD methods previously proposed in literature that might fail for systems with a <b>differential</b> <b>index</b> larger than one. The various empirical reduction methods are also applied to a nonlinear DAE system with strangeness index zero. The newly proposed method is able to reduce this type of system, where one of the classical methods fails. Since reducing the size of a nonlinear system by projection does not always result in a shorter simulation time, a grey-box modelling approach is proposed, which replaces the high number of computationally expensive nonlinear functions by a smaller number of parametrized nonlinear functions...|$|R

Meanwhile, remote sensing is known as {{an important source of}} information to estimate fractional vegetation cover in large areas. Today spectral indices have been very popular in the remote sensing of vegetation features. But often reflections of soil and rocks are much more than reflections of sparse vegetation in these areas, that makes separation of plant signals difficult. So in this study measured fractional vegetation cover of a desert area were evaluated with 20 vegetation indices in five different categories as the most appropriate category, or indicator for desert vegetation to be identified. The five categories were including: (1) conventional ratio and <b>differential</b> <b>indices</b> such as NDVI; (2) indices corrected and derived from the traditional indicators such as NDVIc and GNDVI; (3) soil reflectance adjusted indices such as SAVI; (4) triangle indices based on three discreet bands in their equation (Green, Red and NIR) like TVI; and (5) non-conventional ratio and <b>differential</b> <b>indices</b> such as CI.
