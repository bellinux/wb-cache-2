It introduced a state monopoly of the grain trade, prohibited private trading in grain and established the surplus-appropriation system, under which all surplus produce {{in the hands of the}} peasants was to be registered and acquired by the state at fixed prices, so as to accumulate stores of grain for the provisioning of the army and the workers.

5000|$|The {{ensemble}} approach differs {{significantly from}} the Copenhagen approach in its view of diffraction. The Copenhagen interpretation of diffraction, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewpoint</b> <b>of</b> Niels Bohr, puts weight on the doctrine of wave-particle duality. In this view, a particle that is diffracted by a diffractive object, such as for example a crystal, is regarded as really and physically behaving like a wave, split into components, more or less corresponding to the peaks of intensity in the diffraction pattern. Though Dirac does not speak of wave-particle duality, he does speak of [...] "conflict" [...] between wave and particle conceptions. He indeed does describe a particle, before it is detected, as being somehow simultaneously and jointly or partly present in the several beams into which the original beam is diffracted. So does Feynman, who speaks of this as [...] "mysterious".|$|E
50|$|The new {{paradigm}} of power system operation allows a multitude of DERs, including distributed generators, ﬂexible/controllable loads, and energy storage facilities, to be coordinated {{under the umbrella of}} Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). A VPP acts as an intermediary between DERs and the wholesale market and trades energy on behalf of DER owners who are not able to participate in the electricity market alone. In fact, the VPP aggregates the capacity of DGs, ESSs, and FLs to form a coalition of heterogeneous technologies in the hope of trading in the wholesale electricity market. The VPP behaves as a conventional dispatchable power plant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewpoint</b> <b>of</b> other market participants, although it is indeed a cluster of many diverse DERs. Also, in the competitive electricity markets, a virtual power plant acts as an arbitrageur by exercising arbitrage between diverse energy trading ﬂoors (i.e., bilateral and PPA contracts, forward and futures markets, and the pool).|$|E

5000|$|The terms [...] "pro-choice" [...] and [...] "pro-life" [...] are {{examples}} of political framing. They are terms which purposely try to define their philosophies {{in the best possible}} light, while attempting to define their opposition in the worst possible light: [...] "Pro-choice" [...] implies the alternative viewpoint is [...] "pro-coercion" [...] or [...] "anti-choice", while [...] "pro-life" [...] implies the alternative viewpoint is [...] "pro-death" [...] or [...] "anti-life". Similarly each side's use of the term [...] "rights" [...] ("reproductive rights", [...] "right to life of every unborn child") implies a validity in their stance, given that the presumption in language is that rights are inherently a good thing and so implies an invalidity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewpoint</b> <b>of</b> their opponents. (In liberal democracies, a right is seen as something the state and civil society must defend, whether human rights, victims' rights, children's rights, etc. Many states use the word rights in fundamental laws and constitutions to define basic civil principles; both the United Kingdom and the United States possess a Bill of Rights.) Other examples of political framing frequently employed in this context are: [...] "unborn baby", [...] "unborn child", and [...] "pre-born child".|$|E
5000|$|Goldstein strived {{to capture}} {{mountain}} portraits in all seasons, weather, and lighting. This way of photographing included {{a lot of}} observation and study of the mountains photographed. He stated {{that it takes a}} series of photographs to be a [...] "complete portrait of a majestic mountain", but that it was still a [...] "barely adequate introduction". Goldstein focuses on individual peaks instead of the vast mountain ranges. He shows that they all have something interesting and beautiful to be captured. He strived to illuminate or expose the beauty in nature to those that may overlook the grand simplistic wonder of these mountain forms. Goldstein said, [...] "The greatest challenge, and most thrilling exhilaration, comes from reducing the artist's materials to a stark simplicity." [...] He wanted to bring the viewer to a new sense of appreciation. In one of his Zion compilations, Goldstein says, [...] "To those who think that to have seen one mountain is to have seen them all, (as I heard an exhausted husband yell at a thrilled wife, in Yosemite), {{it may be difficult to}} realize that one can never completely see even one mountain. Even its basic form will be continually hanging, re-shaped by light and shadow, during the course of any day. In addition, changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewpoint</b> <b>of</b> the observer, the color and tones of light, and the moods of the sky, provide any mountain with so many faces that its appearance is always a fresh vision." [...] In his photography he exposes the wonders of God's creation as if to say [...] "How can you not believe?" [...] Goldstein often quotes the words of Romantic poets because of their shared interest in Nature. John Keats, William Wordsworth, John Muir, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau are some that are frequently quoted in his works.|$|E
5000|$|A {{major factor}} in Unionist {{thinking}} was the [...] "devaluation of life", the belief that eastern peoples like the Japanese and the Turks attached no value to human life including their own, and unlike the westerners who allegedly clung pathetically to their lives when confronted with danger, easterners supposedly died willingly and happily for the cause. The Unionists intended to emulate the Japanese example by creating a militaristic educational system designed to make every man a soldier and every woman into essentially a soldier-making machine; the concept of jihad would play the same role in motivating the Turkish soldier to fight and die for the caliph (regarded as Allah's representative on the Earth) as bushido did for the Japanese soldier to die for his emperor (regarded by the Japanese as a living god). Ultimately for the Unionists, war was a test of wills, and the side that had the stronger will and hence lesser fear of death would always prevail, and as an eastern people who supposedly cared nothing {{for the value of}} human life, the Unionists believed that the Turks had an innate advantage over the decadent west. It was accepted by the Unionists that provided that an eastern army had the same level of training and technology as a western army, the eastern army had the advantage because of their greater will to win. It was believed by the Unionists that the combination of German training and weapons together with the greater willingness to die motivated by their own superior Islamic and Turkish traditions would make the Ottoman military invincible in war. Reflecting the Unionists' intense sense of Turkish nationalism, the Unionist writer proudly argued in a book that: [...] "We Turks are a first-class warrior nation." [...] Past Ottoman victories over western nations like those over the Serbs at Kosovo in 1389, which ended Serbia as an independent kingdom; over the French, Hungarian, German and other Christian knights at Nicopolis in 1396, which crushed the crusade proclaimed by Pope Boniface IX; the fall of Constantinople in 1453 which ended the eastern Roman Empire; and the battle of Mohacs in 1526 which led to conquest of Hungary were used by the Unionists to argue that the Turks were naturally the greatest soldiers in the world and were much superior to western soldiers. As it were, the Turks had <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewpoint</b> <b>of</b> the Unionists become lazy since those glorious days, and what the Turks needed now was a series of reforms to allow the Turkish society to become the [...] "nation in arms".|$|E
