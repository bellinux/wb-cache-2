50|$|Another {{example of}} a {{behaviour}} that {{has been described as}} a FAP is the egg-retrieval behavior of the <b>graylag</b> <b>goose,</b> reported in classic studies by Niko Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz. Like many ground-nesting birds, if an egg becomes displaced from the nest, the greylag rolls it back to the nest with its beak. The sight of the displaced egg is the sign stimulus and elicits the egg-retrieval behaviour. If the egg is removed from the goose during the performance of egg-rolling, the bird often continues with the behavior, pulling its head back as if an imaginary egg is still being maneuvered by the underside of its beak. The greylag will also attempt to retrieve other egg-shaped objects, such as a golf ball, door knob, or even a model egg too large to have possibly been laid by the goose itself (i.e. a supernormal stimulus).|$|E
40|$|The first {{catalytic}} asymmetric total {{synthesis of}} mycocerosic acid was achieved via {{the application of}} iterative enantioselective 1, 4 -addition reactions and allows for the efficient construction of 1, 3 -polymethyl arrays with full stereocontrol; further exemplified by the synthesis of tetramethyl-decanoic acid, {{a component of the}} preen-gland wax of the <b>graylag</b> <b>goose,</b> Anser anser. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{interference}} from nuclear copies of mitochondrial DNA (numts), mtDNA of the white Roman goose (domestic goose) was extracted from liver mitochondria. The mtDNA control region was amplified using a long PCR strategy and then sequenced. Neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum-likelihood approaches were implemented using the 1, 177 bp mtDNA control region sequences to compute the phylogenetic relationships of the domestic goose with other geese. The resulting identity values for the white Roman geese were 99. 1 % (1, 166 / 1, 177) with western graylag geese and 98. 8 % (1, 163 / 1, 177) with eastern graylag geese. In molecular phylogenetic trees, the white Roman goose was grouped in the graylag lineage, indicating that the white Roman goose came from the <b>graylag</b> <b>goose</b> (Anser anser). Thus, the scientific name of the white Roman goose should be Anser anser 'White Roman. '...|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 119 fresh faecal samples were {{collected}} from graylag geese migrating northwards in April. Also, cloacal swabs were taken from 100 carcasses of graylag geese shot during the hunting season in August. In addition, samples were taken from 200 feral pigeons and five mallards. The cultivation of bacteria detected Campylobacter jejuni jejuni in six of the pigeons, {{and in one of}} the mallards. Salmonella diarizona 14 :k:z 53 was detected in one <b>graylag</b> <b>goose,</b> while all pigeons and mallards were negative for salmonellae. No avian paramyxovirus was found in any of the samples tested. One mallard, from an Oslo river, was influenza A virus positive, confirmed by RT-PCR and by inoculation of embryonated eggs. The isolate termed A/Duck/Norway/ 1 / 03 was found to be of H 3 N 8 type based on sequence analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase segments, and serological tests. This is the first time an avian influenza virus has been isolated in Norway.

40|$|Bird sound {{classification}} {{and recognition}} using wavelets In this paper a new method for automatic classification {{and recognition of}} bird sounds is presented. Our main idea is to study, how inharmonic and transient bird sounds can be recognized efficiently. The data consisted of sounds of eight bird species. Five species, the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), the <b>Graylag</b> <b>Goose</b> (Anser anser), the Corncrake (Crex crex), the River Warbler (Locustella fluviatilis), and the Magpie (Pica pica) have inharmonic sounds, whereas the remaining three reference species, the Quail (Coturnix coturnix), the Spotted Crake (Porzana porzana), and the Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) have harmonic sounds. The wavelet analysis was selected due to its ability to preserve both frequency and temporal information, {{and its ability to}} analyse signals which contain discontinuities and sharp spikes. The feature vectors calculated with the proposed algorithm from the wavelet coefficients were used as the inputs of two neural networks, the self-organizing map (SOM) and the multilayer perceptron (MLP). The results were encouraging, for the unsupervised SOM network recognized 78 % and the supervised MLP network 96 % of the test sounds correctly...|$|E
40|$|The egg-rolling {{behavior}} of the <b>graylag</b> <b>goose</b> is an often quoted example of a fixed-action pattern. The bird will even attempt to roll a brick back to its nest! Despite excellent visual acuity it apparently "takes a brick for an egg. " Evolution optimizes utility, not veridicality. Yet textbooks take it {{for a fact that}} human vision evolved so as to approach veridical perception. How do humans manage to dodge the laws of evolution? I will show that they don't, but that human vision is an idiosyncratic user interface. By way of an example I consider the case of pictorial perception. Gleaning information from still images is an important human ability and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. I will discuss a number of instances of extreme non-veridicality and huge inter-observer variability. Despite their importance in applications (information dissemination, personnel selection,...) such huge effects have remained undocumented in the literature, although they can be traced to artistic conventions. The reason appears to be that conventional psychophysics-by design-fails to address the qualitative, that is the meaningful, aspects of visual awareness whereas this is the very target of the visual arts.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} dietary fiber sources on the meat quality, {{oxidative}} stability, and blood parameters of growing <b>Graylag</b> <b>geese</b> (28 – 112 d) were investigated. The birds were randomly allocated into 4 treatments, of which dietary fiber was mainly from corn straw silage (CSS), steam-exploded corn straw (SECS), steam-exploded wheat straw (SEWS), and steam-exploded rice straw (SERS). No influence (P> 0. 05) {{on the basic}} chemical components, oxidative stability, or organolep-tic traits of muscle were observed, except that birds fed SECS had a higher (P < 0. 05) protein propor-tion than those fed CSS or SERS, and CSS increased (P < 0. 01) the cholesterol content when compared to SEWS or SERS. Regarding fatty acid profile in meat, CSS and SECS increased (P < 0. 01) the proportion of C 18 : 2 n 6 t and decreased that of C 21 : 0 and C 22 : 0 {{when compared to the}} others. The birds fed SERS had a higher (P < 0. 05) proportion of C 20 : 0 and C 22 : 0 than the others, a higher proportion of C 20 : 5 n 3, n- 3 fatty acids, Δ- 9 desaturase (18) index compared to those fed CSS or SECS, and a lower (P < 0. 01) proportion of C 20 : 1 n 9 than those fed SECS or SEWS. Additionally, SEWS resulted in a higher (P < 0. 01) proportion of C 20 : 2 when compared to the others. In conclusion, these fibers affect just the protein propor-tion, cholesterol content, and fatty acid profile of breast muscle, along with the concentration of TG and MDA in blood, but not the other characteristics. No supe-rior fiber source exists with respect to meat quality, suggesting that <b>Graylag</b> <b>geese</b> feeding should make the most economically of the convenient fiber source with appropriate pretreatment...|$|R
50|$|In psychology, {{imprinting}} is {{any type}} of rapid learning that occurs in a particular life stage. While this rapid learning is independent of the behavioral outcome, it also establishes it and can effect behavioral responses to different stimuli. Konrad Lorenz {{is well known for}} his classic studies of filial imprinting in <b>graylag</b> <b>geese.</b> From 1935 to 1938, he presented himself to a group of newly hatched gosling and took note of how he was instantly accepted, followed, and called to {{as if he were the}} one who laid them himself. As the first moving object they encountered, Lorenz studied the phenomenon in how quickly the geese were able to form such an irreversible bond. Through his work he demonstrated that this only developed during a brief “critical period,” which was about a few hours after hatching. Lorenz also discovered a long-lasting effect of his studies, and that was a shift in the species' sexual imprinting as a result from imprinting upon a foster mother of a second species. For certain species, when raised by a second one, they develop and retain imprinted preferences and approach the second species they were raised by rather than choose their own, if given a choice.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, an {{extensive}} study {{was carried out}} on the synthesis of deoxypolypropionates via zirconium-catalyzed asymmetric carboalumination of alkenes. Three major protocols were developed and discussed. (1) The ZACA (Zr-catalyzed Asymmetric Carboalumination) reaction based on 3 -buten- 1 -ol were developed. By higher alkylalumination of unprotected 3 -butene- 1 -ol, the (R) - or (S) - 3 -methyl- 1 -alkanol could be produced with 95 % enantiopurity in 90 % yield in one step. An efficient 3 -step protocol was developed based on this method {{for the construction of}} α-monoheterofunctional deoxypolypropionates. (2) ZACA reaction based on styrene combined with the in situ negishi cross-coupling tandem process were developed. This method provide an efficient protocol to the synthesis of α,ω-diheterofunctional deoxypolypropionates starting with anti-dimethyl motif. (3) We discovered the “One-Pot” conversion of inexpensive free allyl alcohol to (R) - or (S) - 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol (with or without TBS-protection) with 91 % enantiopurity in 82 % yield. An efficient protocol was developed based on this method for the construction of α,ω-diheterofunctional deoxypolypropionates starting with syn-dimthyl motifes. ^ Natural products synthesized with our novel protocols were discussed, for example the major acid component of preen-gland wax of <b>graylag</b> <b>goose,</b> Anser anser; C 5 -C 13 fragment of (-) -callystatin A; key intermediates for the synthesis of ionomycine and doliculide. In the fifth charpter, the ZACA reaction of the 1, 4 -pentadiene was discussed. ...|$|E

Most of the 20 species are found in the cooler parts of the Northern Hemisphere, the exceptions being 3 species of Southern Hemisphere swans. All are vegetarians, obtaining much of their food from terrestrial surface vegetation in the case of geese, and from subsurface aquatic vegetation in the case of swans. The patterns of the downy young tend to be pale and simple, without strong head or back patterning, and in most species the adult plumages are also fairly simple, with whites and blacks often predominating. The white plumage of most adult swans appears to be related to visibility needs associated with their high degree of territorial spacing. The most highly territorial swans are also the most strongly vocal ones, for the same reason. However, vocalizations of the sexes are very similar, and usually differ only in minor pitch characteristics. Most of the swans and geese are quite strongly migratory, but the insular Hawaiian goose not only has become nonmigratory but also has become semiterrestrial and has evolved reduced toe webbing as it has adapted to a mountainous existence on old lava fields...|$|E
40|$|The aim {{of study}} was to {{determine}} of basic values slaughter meat production and histological parameters of pectoral muscle in quadruple 24 weeks old crossbred geese. The hybrids produced using Graylag, White Kołuda and Slovakian geese. The geese were divided to 4 groups differing crosses scheme. The body weight before slaughter was in the range from 4, 752 g to 4, 921 g, weight of carcass with neck from 3, 101 g to 3, 175 g and weight of breast muscles from 649 g to 698 g. Histological analysis of pectoral muscle showed that diameters of white fibers (αW) was in the range from 43 μm to 46 μm, red fibers (βR) from 19. 4 μm to 22. 1 μm. The percentage share of αW muscle fibers was in the range from 25. 3 % to 28. 9 %, βR fibers from 71. 1 % to 74. 7 %. The number of muscle fibers per unit area was in the range from 256 to 316 and intramuscular fat content from 3. 9 % to 6. 7 %.

40|$|Infectious {{bronchitis}} virus (IBV) {{causes a}} costly respiratory viral disease of chickens. The role of wild {{birds in the}} epidemiology of IBV is poorly understood. We detected diverse coronaviruses by PCR in wildfowl and wading birds in England. Sequence analysis showed some viruses {{to be related to}} IBV. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a group 3 coronavirus, causes a costly viral disease of chickens that is found worldwide (1). It can cause respiratory disease in chickens of all ages and a loss of production and egg quality in mature hens (2). Some strains are nephropathogenic, resulting in renal-induced mortality rates of up to 25 % for susceptible flocks (1). Currently, the poultry industry controls disease through the use of vaccines. However, IBV continuously generates antigenic variants; current vaccines offer no protection against some of them (3). Wild birds may play a role as both reservoirs and long-distance vectors of IBV. Recently, group 3 coronaviruses genetically similar to IBV were detected in healthy galliform and nongalliform birds (4, 5). This finding may suggest that wild birds are able to carry IBV-like viruses asymptomatically. Other studies have detected coronaviruses that are genetically distinct from IBV in wild birds, including <b>graylag</b> <b>geese</b> (Anser anser), rock doves (Columba livia), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), Chinese bulbuls (Pycnonotus sinensis), red-whiskered bulbuls (Pycnonotus jocosus), gray-backed thrushes (Turdus hortulorum), blackbirds (Turdus merula), white-rumped munias (Lonchura striata), and scaly-breasted munias (Lonchura punctulata) (6, 7).

40|$|Anseriformes deserve special {{attention}} in the epidemiology of Brachyspira spp. because diverse Anseriformes species have been described to act as highly efficient carriers of several Brachyspira spp. that can also infect livestock. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence and diversity of Brachyspira spp. in waterfowl that winter in Spain. Brachyspira spp. were isolated from 51 of the 205 faecal samples collected from <b>graylag</b> <b>geese</b> and mallards in the Villafáfila Lagoons Nature Reserve (Northwestern Spain). The Brachyspira species identified through phenotyping, PCR and sequencing of the nox gene were B. pilosicoli (5. 9 %), B. alvinipulli (11. 8 %), "B. hampsonii" (19. 6 %), B. murdochii (23. 5 %) and B. innocens (39. 2 %). The most relevant finding of this study is the description of "B. hampsonii" in specimens from birds for the first time. Phylogenetic analysis of the nox gene sequences grouped all of the obtained "B. hampsonii" isolates into a cluster with Brachyspira strains previously identified by others as "B. hampsonii" and separated from other Brachyspira spp. isolates and reference strains. Additionally, this cluster was related to clades that grouped B. murdochii and B. innocens isolates. The identification of "B. hampsonii" was also achieved in 8 of the 10 isolates by sequencing the 16 S rRNA gene and tlyA gene. Regardless of the species identified, no antimicrobial resistance was observed in any of the enteropathogenic isolates recovered. This is the first description of "B. hampsonii" in European waterfowl, which might represent hosts that serve as natural reservoirs of this Brachyspira species. This finding indicates that this spirochete is not limited to North America, and its presence in wild birds in Europe poses a risk of transmission to livestock...|$|R
