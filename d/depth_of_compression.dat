A non zero mean flow-rate is established via a reciprocating flat plate compressing and decompressing {{a portion of the}} flexible tube with a controllable frequency and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression.</b> Four parameters of the problem were examined, namely the frequency of the oscillating plate, its length, the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> and the location where the tube is compressed. Four signals were simultaneously recorded, namely the flow-rate at the mid length of the hard tube, the static pressure at the tube’s ends and the displacement of the oscillating plate. Also, the tube cross-sectional area was measured versus the displacement of the oscillating plate for various values of the maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression.</b> Analysis of the obtained data showed that a unidirectional flow is established increasing the frequency of compression and it maximizes when the compression frequency coincides with the natural frequency of the hydraulic loop. The mean value of the flow-rate increases when the point of compression moves far from the mid length of the flexible tube, when the length of the reciprocating plate increases and when the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> increases.

LPB can provide deep compression for improved surface characteristics. The study focuses on the surface roughness, micro-hardness and surface integrity aspects on soft AISI 420 STAVAX ESR martensitic stainless steel AISI 420 material. This material is pronounced as difficult to cut materials like titanium, Inconel 718 etc. The investigation of surface integrity was done on this materials in terms of operating parameters like sliding speed, feed rate and depth of penetration (DOP) identifying the predominant factors among the selected parameters. The steel balls used were cryogenically treated at sub zero temperature of - 176 degrees. Sub-surface micro-hardness study were also done to asses the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> altered zone, surface roughness and surface hardness. The process can be applied to critical components effectively as the LPB process has cycle time advantages and also low investment cost.

This also improved on concentricity of work material. More the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> produced low surface roughness at low sliding speed, feed rate with larger ball diameter.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} effects of shot peening (SP) coverage on the compressive residual stress magnitude, depth, and relaxation of residual stresses due to thermal exposure, as well as fatigue strength of IN 718, a nickel-base superalloy. The residual stress-depth profiles (both <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> and magnitude) for coupons shot peened to different coverage levels of 82 % (0. 2 T where T = time to achieve full area coverage) to 400 % (4 T) show a slight trend of increased <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> with increase in coverage. Though having similar residual stress distributions, the coupons exhibited markedly different cold work distributions. While 82 % (0. 2 T) coverage resulted {{in less than five}} percent cold work, increasing coverage to 400 % (4 T) resulted in cold work as high as thirty-five percent. The heavily cold worked surfaces of the higher coverage coupons exhibited significant relaxation of surface residual stresses, accompanied by corresponding reduction of cold work upon thermal exposure at 525 °C for 10 hours. In contrast, the low cold work associated with lower SP coverage resulted in little relaxation of residual stresses under the same conditions. These observations were consistent with findings in other alloy systems. High cycle fatigue (HCF) performance at 525 °C showed little dependence on peening coverage. Even with deeper compression achieved through low plasticity burnishing (LPB), the 525 C fatigue performance of IN 718 was only marginally improved. There may be other controlling elevated temperature fatigue mechanisms, such as oxidation, operating here that do not depend on residual stresses.

The effect of low plasticity burnishing (LPB) on the HCF performance and FOD tolerance of a first stage Ti- 6 Al- 4 V turbine engine vane have been investigated in both tension-tension (R= 0. 1) and fully revered bending (R=- 1). Actual vanes from fielded engines and blade-edge feature samples were fatigue tested with FOD simulated by EDM notches. The fatigue strength for LPB processed blades increased over 4 -fold for both vanes and vane-edge feature specimens with FOD 0. 020 in. deep, and was undiminished by 0. 030 in. deep FOD. Assuming a Kt = 3 HCF performance criteria, LPB provided tolerance of FOD up to 0. 10 in. deep.

The vibration fatigue performance of the standard test coupons made by Ni-based superalloy K 417 with and without laser shock peening is researched.

The results indicated that the compress residual stress is up to 1. 0 mm in the test coupons after LSP, and the maximum residual compressive stress is about 660 MPa under the surface. At the same time, the high pressure shock wave caused by laser propagate into the material which formed high density dislocation in the surface of the samples, and the γ ' is divided leading to increase the sub-grain. Because of the deep residual compressive stress, high density dislocation and much more sub-grains, the vibration fatigue strength is improved about 180 MPa by LSP.

Compressive residual stresses {{of the order of}} material yield strength in quenched and tempered, 38 HRC 4340 steel were achieved via LPB on as-corroded surfaces and sub-surface layers. The total <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> was about 1. 25 mm (0. 05 in.).

40|$|AIM: Feedback during CPR may {{facilitate}} quality in chest compressions, but {{has also been}} associated with caregiver complaints such as stiff wrists, {{the need for more}} force and increased fatigue. This concern about extra work is, when using the CPREzy with its own spring-loaded surface, particularly relevant {{in the face of an}} increased number of successive compressions. This manuscript evaluates the objective workloads for caregivers with and without the CPREzy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An air pressure driven, piston device was used to generate controlled compressions in a manikin model. The pressure was applied for chest compressions with each of the following: the cylindrical end of the piston, a wooden block as dummy for the CPREzy, and the CPREzy itself. Three manikins with subjectively different spring compliances were selected for the tests. Series of 20 compressions were performed over a wide range of pressures. RESULTS: No additional force is required to achieve a given <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> with or without the CPREzy. However, some additional work is required, ranging from 21 to 26. 5 %. This work is caused by the longer compression distance associated with the need to compress two springs (e. g. the CPREzy and the chest wall) instead of one (e. g. the chest wall). CONCLUSION: The subjective feeling of increased rescuer fatigue with the CPREzy can, at least in part, be attributed to the extra work required for compressing the spring of the CPREzy. Improved accuracy in chest compression depth is likely to be another, more significant, factor in rescuer fatigue...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{the present}} study, {{response}} surface methodology {{has been used}} to optimize turn-assisted deep cold rolling process of AISI 4140 steel. A regression model is developed to predict surface hardness and surface roughness using response surface methodology and central composite design. In the development of predictive model, deep cold rolling force, ball diameter, initial roughness of the workpiece, and number of tool passes are considered as model variables. The rolling force and the ball diameter are the significant factors on the surface hardness and ball diameter and numbers of tool passes are found to be significant for surface roughness. The predicted surface hardness and surface roughness values and the subsequent verification experiments under the optimal operating conditions confirmed the validity of the predicted model. The absolute average error between the experimental and predicted values at the optimal combination of parameter settings for surface hardness and surface roughness is calculated as 0. 16 % and 1. 58 % respectively. Using the optimal processing parameters, the surface hardness is improved from 225 to 306 HV, which resulted in an increase in the near surface hardness by about 36 % and the surface roughness is improved from 4. 84 µm to 0. 252 µm, which resulted in decrease in the surface roughness by about 95 %.

We collected data regarding compression rate, hand placement, depth, and recoil via a questionnaire to determine knowledge, and then we assessed performance using 60 seconds <b>of</b> <b>compressions</b> on a simulation mannequin. Results: Data from 200 enrollments were analyzed by evaluators blinded to subject knowledge. Regarding knowledge, 94 % of participants correctly identified parameters for rate, 58 % for hand placement, 74 % for depth, and 94 % for recoil. Participants identifying an effective rate of  ≥ 100 performed compressions at a significantly higher rate than participants identifying < 100 (µ= 117 vs. 94, p< 0. 001). Participants identifying correct hand placement performed significantly more compressions adherent to guidelines than those identifying incorrect placement (µ= 86 % vs. 72 %, p< 0. 01). No significant differences were found in depth or recoil performance based on knowledge of guidelines. Conclusion: Knowledge of guidelines was variable; however, CPR knowledge significantly impacted certain aspects of performance, namely rate and hand placement, whereas depth and recoil were not affected. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compressions</b> was poor regardless of prior knowledge, and knowledge did not correlate with recoil performance. Overall performance was suboptimal and additional training may be needed to ensure consistent, effective performance and therefore better outcomes after cardiopulmonary arrest.

40|$|One of {{the three}} {{contraindications}} to initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a condition where the patient is in the terminal stage of the disease. (Bydžovský, 2008) The patient's terminal condition of incurable disease must be diagnosed by a doctor, not a paramedic or other health professional. (Sláma, 2009) The paramedic can ( [...] .) initiate and perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. (Decree 55 / 2011 Coll., § 17, letter. B) In an atmosphere where over-optimistic presentation of resuscitation protocol outcomes is growing, {{many people believe that}} it is the only orrect procedure for circulatory arrest regardless of life stage or terminal conditions. This increases the pressure put on the rescuers and doctors in pre-hospital emergency care by loved ones and family members of victims of sudden circulatory arrest. A paramedic and a doctor may respond the fear of legal challenges for failure to provide heroic care by actually begining resuscitation on patients with end-stage disease, but with less emphasis on the frequency and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> of the sternum against their knowledge and beliefs. This phenomenon is called "hollywood resuscitation. " (Sláma, 2009) The purpose of this thesis is to outline the ethical issues of resuscitation on patients in the terminal phase of illness as perceived by emergency workers. The research question that I deal with is, ?How do emergency medical rescue service staff access the decision to resuscitate terminally ill patients with particular regard to the expectations of family members?? The introduction introduces the reader with the nature of the paramedic profession, the importance of resuscitation and my relationship to the topic. In the theoretical part I define terms such as emergency medical service, resuscitation and its indications and contraindications, medical law and terminal condition. To get the results I used qualitative research that I realized at Emergency Medical Service South Moravian Region. I asked ten basic questions. The research group consists of two male doctors, four female doctors and seven paramedics. The interviews show that the notion of hollywood resuscitation is not known, but resuscitation at the interface of ethics and justice is experienced by all. Four paramedics rate their actions as unethical, this leaves them with the feeling of disapointment in themselves and their profession. They feel forced into this bind by the legislation. For the other three paramedics ethics at the place of the event were either do not percieve or they transfered esponsibility to the doctor by calling him. All of these doctors were fully qualified and most of them have not launched the resuscitation against their ethical beliefs. Some doctors avoid the issue by speaking with sensitivity to the family, others by solving the patient's current difficulties and they get the general information about him later. To improve this situation by contributing quality education to families in the facility where the patient is monitored for his primary diagnosis. Another solution could be specific document outlining end of life choices as desired by the patient or card on which ?Do Not Resuscitate? direction is clearly given. According to these specific documents pre-event direction is given that will direct amendment the standard procedure for emergency medical services. The rescue workers will feel greater legal certainty. This final designation document solution will increase paramedic´s competences...|$|E
40|$|Out-of-hospital {{cardiac arrest}} (OHCA) is a {{globally}} important public health issue {{that continues to}} be a significant cause of premature death. The incidence of OHCA treated by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is around 50 to 55 / 100, 000 per person-years across the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. There is significant disparity in the rates of survival to hospital discharge from OHCA. For OHCA treated by EMS this rate can vary as much as 1 % to 31 %. In order to improve outcomes for cardiac arrests the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) aims to integrate resuscitation science with real world clinical practice. ILCOR states {{there is a need to}} develop a culture of high quality resuscitation using a quality improvement approach. Survival from cardiac arrest is a complex issue with many stakeholders that form the basis of a system of care. ILCOR proposes that individual performance needs to be evaluated so that participants within the system of care are informed and can therefore effectively intervene to improve care Paramedics are the primary treatment providers for OHCA. Recently the resuscitation guidelines, which paramedics use in their practice, have emphasised the performance of quality chest compressions. With this in mind this thesis sought to investigate whether the position of the paramedic performing chest compressions, either from-the-side (FTS) or over-the-head (OTH), influenced the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A review literature identified only a few small studies in which OTH CPR was investigated over short durations. There was heterogeneity in the study design, types of participants and quality metrics measured with inconsistencies in the results across the studies. All of the studies identified in the review were manikin studies that used manikin-based technology, such as the Laerdal Skill Reporter (LSR), to measure the quality of CPR. Subsequent to these studies defibrillator technology has evolved and now devices that can measure CPR quality have been integrated into the defibrillator, an example of which is Q-CPR associated with the MRx defibrillator. Such devices enable measurement of CPR quality in both manikin and human studies. The first study (Chapter 3) investigated if the new defibrillator technology could be used to measure CPR quality in a manikin study. This study compared the measurement of CPR quality metrics simultaneously using LSR and Q-CPR, for chest compression performed OTH and FTS. The principle finding of this study was that there is no significant difference in the majority of chest compression quality metrics measured between the LSR and the Q-CPR devices. However, there were significant differences in the measurement of duty cycle and also the depth of compressions between the two devices. The mean difference in the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> was observed to increase with an increasing incidence of leaning. The conclusion was that Q-CPR is a suitable alternative to LSR for measurement of the CPR quality and thus it was used in the main study. The main study compared OTH and FTS CPR quality (performed by 30 paramedics) during two simulated cardiac arrest scenarios, each of approximately 25 minutes duration. There was no significant difference in mean CPR quality between compressions performed OTH or FTS for all metrics measured. We concluded that for two rescuer CPR the composite technique, where the paramedic that is positioned at the head of the manikin performs OTH CPR, is an effective alternative to the traditional method of only performing CPR FTS...|$|E

40|$|Background - Cardiopulmonary {{resuscitation}} {{is a life}} {{skill that}} requires proper psychomotor skill development. It is a key component in the Concept of the "Chain of Survival. Training in CPR has been advocated since 1974 with subsequent courses and training programs. Like many programs, the curricula tend to be instructor centered, few, {{if any of the}} curricula have addressed the issue of learning styles. There is a significant amount of literature describing the lack of success in the acquisition and retention of skills. Several investigations have demonstrated that this system may improve CPR delivery and skill retention. Individuals vary in their ability to perceive, organize, store, process, understand, and use information. These differences are known as cognitive styles. Methods - This project used an experimental design with an aptitude (learning style) treatment (feedback) interaction design. In this study two factors used in the analysis of variance. Subjects were administered the Group Embedded Figures Test to determine their level of field dependence. Groups were then randomized to receive feedback on skill performance. Following initial instruction subjects were asked to complete a three- minute bout of CPR each week for four weeks, using their assigned method of feedback. At the conclusion of the fourth week, subjects were tested without feedback. Performance measures were rate <b>of</b> <b>compressions,</b> mean <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>compressions,</b> percentage <b>of</b> correct <b>compressions,</b> and percentage <b>of</b> correct ventilations. Results - No significant interaction was found between learning style and method of feedback for any of the variables. No main effect was noted for any of the variables and learning style. A main effect was noted for method of feedback relative to the percentage <b>of</b> correct <b>compressions</b> and the percentage of correct ventilations. Both the computer auditory and computer visual groups achieved a greater percentage <b>of</b> correct <b>compressions</b> than instructor driven feedback. For the percentage of correct ventilations, computer auditory feedback resulted in a high percentage of correct ventilations compared to instructor driven feedback. Conclusions - Computer feedback has been demonstrated to enhance student performance, irrespective of learning style. Enhanced performance has a clinical significance...|$|R

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training in school systems has been questioned, considering that young {{students may not}} have the physical or cognitive skills required to perform complex tasks correctly. In the study conducted by Fleishhackl and coworkers, students as young as 9 years were able to successfully and effectively learn basic CPR skills, including automated external defibrillator deployment, correct recovery position, and emergency calling. As in adults, physical strength may limit the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> chest <b>compressions</b> and ventilation volumes given by younger individuals with low body mass index; however, skill retention is good. Training all persons across an entire community in CPR may have a logarithmic improvement in survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest because bystanders, usually family members, are more likely to know CPR and ca...|$|R
