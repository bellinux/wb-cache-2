40|$|We {{consider}} traffic scheduling {{in performance}} guaranteed switches with optical fabrics to ensure 100 % throughput and bounded packet delay. Each switch reconfiguration consumes a constant {{period of time}} called reconfiguration overhead, during which no packet can be transmitted across the switch. To minimize the packet delay bound for an arbitrary traffic matrix, the number of switch configurations in the schedule should be no larger than the switch size. This is called minimum delay scheduling, where the ideal minimum packet delay bound is determined solely by the total overhead of the switch reconfigurations. A speedup in the switch determines the actual packet delay bound, which decreases toward the ideal bound as the speedup increases. Our objective is to minimize the required speedup <b>S</b> <b>schedule</b> under a given actual packet delay bound. We propose a novel minimum delay scheduling algorithm quasi largest-entry-first (QLEF) to solve this problem. Compared with the existing minimum delay scheduling algorithms MIN and α- i-SCALE, QLEF dramatically cuts down the required <b>S</b> <b>schedule</b> bound. For example, QLEF only requires <b>S</b> <b>schedule</b> = 17. 89 for N = 450, whereas MIN and α i-SCALE require <b>S</b> <b>schedule</b> = 37. 13 and 27. 82, respectively. This gives a significant performance gain of 52 % over MIN and 36 % over α i-SCALE. © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} examined interval timing in rats {{during a}} momentary, unsignaled, {{increase in the}} time to reinforcement. A session began with intervals programmed according to a fixed interval (FI) 60 <b>s</b> reinforcement <b>schedule,</b> changed to either an FI 90 s, FI 120 s, or FI 180 <b>s</b> <b>schedule</b> at an unpredictable point, {{and then returned to}} an FI 60 <b>s</b> <b>schedule</b> after 1, 8, or 24 successive long intervals had elapsed. Overall, postreinforcement wait time duration increased with increases in the scheduled time to reinforcement. The amount by which wait time increased did not depend on the duration of longer intervals, but did depend on the number of longer intervals intercalated into a session. The results indicate that rats are sensitive to moment-by-moment changes in the time to reinforcement and support other studies showing an asymmetry between timing upward and downward shifts in the criterion for reinforcement of an FI schedule...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} a synopsis {{of the responses}} of forwarder and airline air cargo executives to a survey administered in late 1999 and early 2000. The study was directed at understanding information technology adoption and use in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>scheduled</b> air cargo sector. The report investigates dimensions of perceptions of IT, IT adoption, operational performance and airline-forwarder relations in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>scheduled</b> air cargo industry. Technologies include EDI, electronic commerce, cargo community systems, barcoding, tracking and tracing, radio, wireless, and automated vehicle location systems. The study finds that IT adoption is not evenly distributed and varies across several dimensions. It suggests that a strategy of “one size fits all” for information systems is problematic. The development of information systems that do not support firms to invoke their desired modes of differentiation does not engage the existing structure of the industry. Forwarders and airlines and larger and smaller firms have different goals and strategies. To the extent that larger firms have different trust and cooperative relations with their airline partners, they will integrate information systems differently into their supply chains. Smaller firms {{may not be able}} to integrate information systems in the same manner as larger firms. Across dimensions of size and other attributes, these firms require appropriate information technology solutions...|$|R

40|$|Based on the delay-reduction hypothesis, a less {{profitable}} schedule {{should be}} rejected if its duration exceeds the mean delay to reinforcement. It should be accepted if its duration is {{shorter than the}} mean delay. This was tested for humans, using a successive-choice schedule. The accessibility of the less profitable (variable-interval 18 <b>s)</b> <b>schedule</b> was varied by changing the duration (in terms of a fixed interval) of the waiting-time component preceding its presentation. Forty-eight students {{were randomly assigned to}} three groups. In Phase 1, the duration of the less profitable schedule equaled the mean delay to reinforcement in all groups. In Phase 2, waiting time preceding the less profitable schedule was reduced in Group 1 and increased in Group 2. Thus, the schedule was correlated either with a relative delay increase (Group 1) or a delay reduction (Group 2). In Group 3, conditions remained unchanged. As predicted, acceptance of the less profitable schedule decreased in Group 1 and increased in Group 2. The increased acceptance in Group 2 was accompanied by a decreased acceptance of the more profitable (variable-interval 3 <b>s)</b> <b>schedule,</b> resembling a pattern of negative contrast.

40|$|Pigs are non-specialist feeders {{with high}} {{capacities}} to adapt their diets within wide limits to prevailing and unpredictable conditions. Under husbandry conditions however, pigs are usually fed under extremely predictable conditions, i. e. with highly uniform and standardized diets, ad libitum or at standardized times. Although pigs, in this way, obtain their food {{with the lowest}} amount of effort and costs, studies in various different species have shown that animals may prefer to work for food, rather than receiving food for free. In addition, recent studies showed that animals may also be sensitive to risk and variance associated with food sources which may be expressed as a preference for unpredictable over predictable schedules when working for food in an operant task (risk-sensitive foraging). Since feeding is {{an important aspect of}} the daily animal husbandry routine which is likely to have a high impact on animal welfare, {{it is important to know}} whether (domesticated) pigs also prefer to work for unpredictable as opposed to predictable feeding schedules under husbandry conditions. For that purpose, nine gilts (Finish Landrace × York) were trained to respond in a two-choice operant task. In Test 1, pigs could choose between response options associated with either a FI- 8 <b>s</b> <b>schedule</b> (predictable delay) or a VI- 8 <b>s</b> reinforcement <b>schedule</b> (unpredictable delay). In Test 2 they could choose between choice options associated with the delivery of either a predictable food item (identical at all times) or an unpredictable food item (differing in nature across trials), delivered according to a FI- 8 <b>s</b> <b>schedule.</b> Based upon natural foraging strategies of pigs it was expected that that pigs would prefer the unpredictable options in each test. However, the results from our experiment did not support this hypothesis. Factors that may influence the pig's sensitivity to variability in food rewards, are discussed...|$|R
