25|$|This misfortune, {{which for}} a time seemed so bitter and was so hard to bear, {{has proved to be}} a blessing in disguise. The cruel blow which blighted the joys of earth, was the means of turning my eyes to heaven. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> had known Jesus Christ, had not the sorrow that clouded my early years led me to seek comfort in him.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Thompson's {{father died}} as a result of circulatory {{problems}} at the age of 52. The actress has commented that this [...] "tore [...] to pieces", and [...] "I can't begin to tell you how much I regret his not being around". She added, [...] "At the same time, it's possible that were he still alive <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have had the space or courage to do what I've done ... I have a definite feeling of inheriting space. And power." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, the Institute for Historical Review, an {{organization}} known for propagating Holocaust denial, published Robert John's Behind the Balfour Declaration, including a single acknowledgment to Freedman. John wrote that Freedman [...] "gave me copies of materials on the Balfour Declaration, which <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have found {{on my own}} and (he) encouraged my own research." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{certainly}} committed a grave fault here, my friend," [...] he said, [...] "and {{one that is}} seldom forgiven in Leaplow--perhaps <b>I</b> <b>might</b> say <b>never,</b> during the occultation of the great moral postulate, as {{happens to be the}} case at present." ...|$|R
5000|$|After brief spells at Bedford School (1886-1888) and Cheltenham College (1890-1895), {{he became}} a {{schoolmaster}} at Rugby School, where he encouraged Arthur Ransome - against his parents' wishes - to become a writer. Ransome later wrote, [...] "My greatest piece of good fortune in coming to Rugby was that I passed so low into the school ... that I came at once {{into the hands of}} a most remarkable man whom <b>I</b> <b>might</b> otherwise <b>never</b> have met. This was Dr W.H.D. Rouse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said. [...] "Once I {{would have}} put my hand in the fire for you; but when you left me in that dance house I knew {{all there was to}} know of you,--and <b>I</b> hoped you <b>might</b> <b>never</b> come in my way again. Shamed as I am, I could not fall so low as you did then." ...|$|R
2500|$|I will {{be forever}} indebted to Dan [...] for his {{companionship}} and inspiration. Indebted, too, {{because it was}} Dan who insisted on giving my name to the Wulff Series and gave me stature <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have had otherwise. We were fishing together on the Esopus {{in the spring of}} 1930 when I was trying out some new flies I'd designed in revolt to the then available Catskill patterns. The new flies had bucktail wings and tails for better floatation. I had planned to call one of them the Bucktail Coachman. It was Dan who insisted that I call them Wulffs and he started tying them under that name— Lee Wulff in the tribute in Mist on the River-Remembrances of Dan Bailey.|$|E
2500|$|Dismayed to {{find that}} {{groundbreaking}} work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds {{by means of a}} similar tuning fork [...] "contraption", Bell pored over the German scientist's book. Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition, Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: [...] "Without knowing much about the subject, {{it seemed to me that}} if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech." [...] He also later remarked: [...] "I thought that Helmholtz had done it... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a valuable blunder... If I had been able to read German in those days, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have commenced my experiments!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But the Royal Mary fell {{a victim}} to a Spanish privateer, and <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> {{have arrived at}} all but for the gallantry of Captain Blood, who rescued me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I came {{as quickly}} as I could," [...] said a tender voice close to his ear. [...] "But it has taken me some time to find thee. Had {{it not been for}} Folces and his devotion <b>I</b> <b>might</b> mayhap <b>never</b> have found thee. We came to Jerusalem yesterday. To-day at noon I saw thee {{starting}} forth from out the city. I followed thee, but the way was rough.... I feared I should never reach the summit ... and yet 'twas here I wished to speak to thee." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Baxter {{published}} {{a selection of}} children's letters received by the Blue Peter team. Amongst them was a letter from Anthony Hollander who {{wanted to become a}} doctor: he went on to become Professor of Rheumatology and Tissue Engineering at Bristol University, and said that he owes his career to Miss Baxter: [...] "If her letter had shown any hint of ridicule or disbelief <b>I</b> <b>might</b> perhaps <b>never</b> have trained to become a medical scientist or been driven to achieve the impossible dream, and really make a difference to a human being's life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd never 'ave {{got better}} if it 'adn't been for your aunt. 'Tom,' {{she says to}} me, 'you got to get well,' and I 'AD to. Then SHE sickened. She sickened but there ain't much dyin' about your aunt. 'Lor!' she says, 'as if I'd leave you to go muddlin' along alone!' That's what she says. She's got a tongue, 'as your aunt. But it took 'er 'air off--and arst though <b>I</b> <b>might,</b> she's <b>never</b> cared for the wig I got 'er--orf the old lady {{what was in the}} vicarage garden.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{that our}} chief {{occupation}} {{would have been}} gone," [...] said Aileen, with a slight twinkle of her lustrous blue eyes, [...] "and perhaps you and <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have met." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eat {{as much as}} you want," [...] {{said the}} Barmecide. [...] "I bought the woman who makes it for five hundred pieces of gold, so that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> be without it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no blessing {{left for}} me, neither will I ask it!" [...] cried Margaret, {{with a fresh}} burst of tears. [...] "Would it were His will that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> taste food more!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not only}} because it would hurt me to see you and the others tricked out of what you have worked so hard for that I feel I must tell you. If there was nothing more than that, <b>I</b> <b>might,</b> perhaps, <b>never</b> have told you, after all. I want to save my father from a shameful thing." [...] Her voice broke away, and the crimson flush on her face deepened as she went on again. [...] "He has been {{offering}} to sell land that can't belong to him," [...] she asserted accusingly.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Biddy Baxter, {{the editor}} of the children's {{television}} programme Blue Peter published a selection of children's letters received by the Blue Peter team. Amongst them was a letter from Hollander who had written in 1973 that he knew how to save lives. He now says that he owes his career to Miss Baxter: [...] "If her letter had shown any hint of ridicule or disbelief <b>I</b> <b>might</b> perhaps <b>never</b> have trained to become a medical scientist or been driven to achieve the impossible dream, and really make a difference to a human being's life." ...|$|R
6000|$|This I did {{for quite}} a long time, till at last the absurdity of the {{position}} and, I will admit, my own curiosity overcame me, especially as I was very tired and wanted to go to sleep. So advancing most gingerly, I turned down the kaross from over the head of the sleeping woman, much wondering whom I should see, for what man is there that a veiled woman does not interest? Indeed, does not half the interest of woman lie in the fact that her nature is veiled from man, in short a mystery which he is always seeking to solve at his peril, and <b>I</b> <b>might</b> add, <b>never</b> succeeds in solving? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very {{comfortable}} quarters, George," [...] remarked Mr. Stiles, gazing {{round the}} room approvingly; [...] "ship-shape and tidy. I’m glad I met old Dingle. Why, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> ha’ seen you again; and us such pals, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You blessed accidents!" [...] she said, with {{a little}} tremble in her voice. [...] "If you hadn't {{happened}} just then Ted would have gone away in a rage and <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have seen him again. Come now, Sue, and help me dress." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Hester," [...] said Jaquetta, [...] "it is {{so lucky}} {{for me that}} I came down from being a fine lady. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have known Arthur; and if I had, what an absurd {{creature}} I should have been as a poor man's wife!" ...|$|E
6000|$|After all this, papa and mamma both wished <b>I</b> {{think they}} <b>might</b> <b>never</b> [...] hear or be spoken {{to on the}} subject of the Christian Union article, [...] and {{whenever}} any has spoken to me and told me [...] "How much they did [...] enjoy my father's article in the Christian Union" [...] I almost laughed [...] in their faces when I remembered what a great variety of oppinions [...] had been expressed up{{on the subject of}} the Christian Union article [...] of papa's.|$|R
40|$|In late October 1995, I found a {{remarkable}} message on {{my answering machine}} from Ed Weiler, then the Program Scientist for the Hubble Space Telescope. Would I work on the next generation space telescope, the successor to the beautiful HST? It took me mere moments {{to work out the}} answer: Of course! At the time, my work on the COsmic Background Explorer (COBE) was finished, I was writing a book about it (The Very First Light, with John Boslough), and <b>I</b> thought NASA <b>might</b> <b>never</b> do anything nearly as spectacular again. Wow, was I happy to be surprised by that call...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Except {{that when}} Pancks told us of your having {{embarked}} {{in this business}} and with difficulty persuaded us {{that it was really}} you I said to Mr F.'s Aunt then we would come and ask you if it would be agreeable to all parties that she should be engaged at our house when required for I know she often goes to your mama's and I know that your mama has a very touchy temper Arthur--Doyce and Clennam--or <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>might</b> have married Mr F. and might have been at this hour but I am running into nonsense.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if she does," [...] swore the Duke internally, [...] "I would, as Sir Andrew Smith saith, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> touch fair lady's hand." [...] And {{stepping}} back, {{he spoke}} {{a few words}} with Empson the musician, who left the apartment, for a few minutes, and presently returned.|$|E
6000|$|... "Roderick {{would make}} but a faithless treasurer," [...] he said. [...] "Still {{it is not}} too late to restore him to his friends. The loss of the gold can be repaired; but, should any serious {{calamity}} befall the boy, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> regain a perfect peace of mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Friends," [...] she said, as she {{surveyed}} its darksome entrance, [...] "it {{looks like}} {{the door of a}} tomb. Well, in the tomb there is rest, and rest I must have. Leave me to sleep, who, were it not for you, O Oliver, would pray that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> wake again.|$|E
60|$|The red-room was {{a square}} chamber, very seldom slept in, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> say <b>never,</b> indeed, unless when a chance influx of {{visitors}} at Gateshead Hall rendered {{it necessary to}} turn to account all the accommodation it contained: yet {{it was one of}} the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion. A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany. Out of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled- up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane. Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.|$|R
40|$|Actually I {{am not so}} {{sure that}} to look hard at a thing is to forget its name — Valéry’s hasty quip which says as much seems to duck the {{troublesome}} and ever-present tangle of sights and words. For, try as <b>I</b> <b>might,</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> quite break free from language when I take in a work of art by Irwin; studying it involves in some basic way either recognizing by name that which already has one, or else discovering that what is there does not yet have a name. Perhaps Valéry got it wrong on purpose, though. He may have wished to disrupt at any cost our habit of glancing at something in front of us only for the sake of identifying and classifying it with a term. To truly see such a thing, so the claim goes, is altogether different. For this we have to pick up on aspects of it that are unforeseeable beforehand, in spite of our familiarity with the category of things like it that its name names. But even if this is so, the word we have for the particular sort of a thing which is under examination proves helpful. As you set about viewing one of Irwin’s works, you can hazard names or descriptions or metaphors, and, having done this, thereupon attempt to figure out all that still remains unsaid. Seeing his art does not entail forgetting names, then, so much as verifying the limits of what they report. And writing about it amounts to settling on the best words you can find in anticipation of knowingly overburdening them. When you want to really focus in on Irwin’s art, it could be that you have got to adjust how you use language such that it plays a more noticeable role than ever before...|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} {{he stood there}} beside me, {{scratching}} his head. Evidently it was no less {{difficult for him to}} readjust his preconceived conclusions than it is for most human beings; but finally the idea percolated--which it <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have done had he been a man, or <b>I</b> <b>might</b> qualify that statement by saying had he been some men. Finally he spoke.|$|R
60|$|But my {{thoughts}} soon reverted to the dear companions whom I {{had left on}} shore; and as I turned towards the Coral Island, which was now far away to leeward, I sighed deeply, and the tears rolled slowly down my cheeks as I thought that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> see them more.|$|E
60|$|From my father's {{store of}} powder and balls I took {{as much as}} could be {{conveniently}} carried, and this, with such small supply of corn bread and salt pork as filled my hunting-bag, made up an outfit for a journey from which it was reasonable to believe <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> return.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear host," [...] he said, [...] "I left Berlin a {{year ago}} with only one hope--or rather two. The first was that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have to visit Berlin again! The second was that I might have the {{pleasure}} of meeting you as speedily and as often as possible." ...|$|E
60|$|I can {{conceive}} the King's {{relief and}} joy in {{his conviction that}} thus had he drawn my teeth, that betide now what <b>might,</b> <b>I</b> could <b>never</b> defend or justify myself. The immediate sequel took me by surprise. We were {{at the end of}} '85, and my health was suffering from my confinement and its privations. And now my captivity was mitigated. My wife Juana even succeeded in obtaining permission that I should be taken home to Madrid, and there for fourteen months I enjoyed a half liberty, and received the visits of my old friends, among whom were numbered most {{of the members of the}} Court.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did it all}} and I {{have been}} punished for it. Even at the end she <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have gone off if I had not shouted out and tried to climb the wall. She must have {{recognised}} my voice, and, knowing that I had her secret, feared that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> kill her and him too, and so she went. She would not have gone as she did, without even a bonnet or a shawl, {{if it had not}} been for that." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Gray was thirty, and {{so sweet}} and so lovely, you cannot imagine it; and Sadie was ten, {{and just like}} her mother, just a darling slender little copy of her, with auburn tails down her back, and short frocks; and the baby was a year old, and plump and dimpled, and fond of me, and never could get enough of hauling on my tail, and hugging me, and {{laughing}} out its innocent happiness; and Mr. Gray was thirty-eight, and tall and slender and handsome, a little bald in front, alert, quick in his movements, business-like, prompt, decided, unsentimental, and {{with that kind of}} trim-chiseled face that just seems to glint and sparkle with frosty intellectuality! He was a renowned scientist. I do not know what the word means, but my mother would {{know how to use it}} and get effects. She would know how to depress a rat-terrier with it and make a lap-dog look sorry he came. But that is not the best one; the best one was Laboratory. My mother could organize a Trust on that one that would skin the tax-collars off the whole herd. The laboratory was not a book, or a picture, or a place to wash your hands in, as the college president's dog said--no, that is the lavatory; the laboratory is quite different, and is filled with jars, and bottles, and electrics, and wires, and strange machines; and every week other scientists came there and sat in the place, and used the machines, and discussed, and made what they called experiments and discoveries; and often I came, too, and stood around and listened, and tried to learn, for the sake of my mother, and in loving memory of her, although it was a pain to me, as realizing what she was losing out of her life and I gaining nothing at all; for try as <b>I</b> <b>might,</b> <b>I</b> was <b>never</b> able to make anything out of it at all.|$|R
