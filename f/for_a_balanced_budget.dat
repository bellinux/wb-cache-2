2500|$|Portman is {{a leading}} {{advocate}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> amendment. Portman worked with Democratic Senator Jon Tester in 2012 to end the practice of government shutdowns and partnered with Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill on an inquiry into the Obama administration's public relations spending. [...] Portman has proposed [...] "a balanced approach to the deficit" [...] by reforming entitlement programs, writing [...] "eforms should not merely squeeze health beneficiaries or providers but should rather reshape key aspects of these programs {{to make them more}} efficient, flexible and consumer-oriented." [...] Portman became known for his ability to work in a bipartisan fashion when working to pass a repeal of the excise tax on telephone service. [...] He also unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to the surface transportation reauthorization bill to allow states to keep the gas tax money they collect, instead of sending it to Washington with some returned later.|$|E
2500|$|Arkansas {{governor}} Bill Clinton was {{one such}} figure, {{who was elected}} President in 1992 as the Democratic nominee. [...] He labeled himself and governed as a [...] "New Democrat". The party adopted a centrist economic but socially progressive agenda, with the voter base after Reagan having shifted considerably to the right. In an effort to appeal to both liberals and fiscal conservatives, Democrats began to advocate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> and market economy tempered by government intervention (mixed economy), along with a continued emphasis on social justice and affirmative action. The economic policy adopted by the Democratic Party, including the former Clinton administration, {{has been referred to}} as [...] "Third Way". The Democrats lost control of Congress in the election of 1994 to the Republican Party. Re-elected in 1996, Clinton was the first Democratic President since Franklin Roosevelt to be elected to two terms. Following twelve years of Republican rule, the Democrats regained majority control of both the House and the Senate in the 2006 elections.|$|E
2500|$|As OMB {{director}} from May 2006 to August 2007, Portman {{helped to}} craft a $2.9 trillion budget for fiscal year 2008. The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote that [...] "The plan called for making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, {{at a cost of}} more than $500 billion over the five-year life of the proposal. It requested a hefty increase in military spending, along with reductions in low-income housing assistance, environmental initiatives, and health care safety-net programs." [...] Portman {{is said to have been}} [...] "frustrated" [...] with the post, calling the budget that President Bush's office sent to Congress, [...] "not my budget, his budget," [...] and saying, [...] "it was a fight, internally." [...] Edward Lazear of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers said that Portman was the leading advocate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget,</b> while other former Bush administration officials said that Portman was the leading advocate for fiscal discipline, within the administration.|$|E
50|$|Indeed, {{the federal}} {{government}} itself has been criticized heavily for its role in Western Pennsylvania's transportation funding situation; in 2010, it forbade the state's plan <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> transportation <b>budget,</b> which would have involved converting Interstate 80 into a toll road. The killed plan would have accounted not only for transit budgets, but also for funding of significant road and bridge infrastructure, which will now face an additional 5,200 Pittsburgh-area cars because of the federally forced transit cuts, according to one analyst.|$|R

2500|$|McMahon {{campaigned on}} a {{platform}} of fiscal conservatism, lower taxes, and job creation. She opposed the 2009 stimulus act, saying the money from the stimulus [...] "went into government agencies, not the hands of small businesses that are going to create 70% of jobs." [...] McMahon also denounced deficit spending, expressing support <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Constitutional <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> amendment. McMahon blamed Democrats for not reclaiming unspent money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the bailout package, saying the money should be used to repay government debts. She also accused the Executive Branch of evading the system of checks and balances through the use of [...] "policy czars" [...] and executive orders.|$|R
50|$|Although Stevens's {{dealings}} with Country Party leader and Deputy Premier Sir Michael Bruxner were friendly, {{the same was}} not true of his working relationship with the United Australia Party's deputy leader, Eric Spooner. From 1936 onward, Spooner often censured Stevens <b>for</b> not running <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget.</b> Finally, in July 1939, Spooner resigned from cabinet. On 1 August, Spooner moved a parliamentary no confidence motion against Stevens's administration, succeeding by two votes.

50|$|The 1978 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention is {{considered}} the watershed political event in the modern State of Hawaii.

50|$|During the Presidential primaries, Fernandez campaigned in both English and Spanish, {{emphasizing}} that private enterprise {{can do a}} better job than government and calling <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> federal <b>budget.</b> His campaign focused heavily on the first primary in the nation in Puerto Rico, believing that the Hispanic vote would go to a fellow Hispanic. Fernandez's campaign manager, David Miller, later admitted that the Puerto Rico strategy was a failure, as the early voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa completely overshadowed the Puerto Rico primary. After a lackluster showing in Puerto Rico, Fernandez admitted that he was unable to fire up his Hispanic base as much as he thought he could, and the lack of TV coverage of his campaign made it difficult to raise money and garner name recognition.|$|R

5000|$|The {{rationale}} behind the need <b>for</b> achieving <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> {{in the financial}} climate following the Great Recession has been questioned by some Keynesian economists. Andrew Gamble writing in Parliamentary Affairs in 2015 commented: Most macroeconomists now agree that the austerity programme pursued by the Coalition Government in its first two years was both too severe and unnecessary and set back the economic recovery which was underway {{in the first half}} of 2010. The Office of Budget Responsibility confirmed that the austerity programme reduced GDP, while the Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis has calculated that the Coalition Government's austerity programme cost the average household £4000 over the lifetime of the Parliament and severely damaged those public services which were not ring-fenced. [...] Ha-Joon Chang, writing in 2017, observed that [...] "in today’s UK economy, whose underlying stagnation has been masked only by the release of excess liquidity on an oceanic scale, some deficit spending may be good - necessary, even".|$|R

5000|$|However, the Southern Democrats {{controlled}} the entire South with only token Republican opposition, and thus had both {{liberal and conservative}} factions. While the South had many New Deal supporters it also had many conservatives opposed {{to the expansion of}} federal power. Among their leaders were Senators Harry Byrd and Carter Glass of Virginia and Vice President John Nance Garner of Texas. U.S. Senator Josiah Bailey (D-NC) released a [...] "Conservative Manifesto" [...] in December 1937, which included several statements of conservative philosophical tenets, including the line [...] "Give enterprise a chance, and I will give you the guarantees of a happy and prosperous America." [...] The document called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> federal <b>budget,</b> state's rights, and an end to labor union violence and coercion.

50|$|Washington {{provides}} {{strong support}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> federal <b>budget,</b> {{arguing that the}} nation's credit is {{an important source of}} strength and security. He urges the American people to preserve the national credit by avoiding war, avoiding unnecessary borrowing, and paying off any national debt accumulated in times of war as quickly as possible in times of peace so that future generations do not have to take on the financial burdens that others have taken on themselves. Despite his warnings to avoid taking on debt, Washington does state his belief that sometimes it is necessary to spend money to prevent dangers or wars that will in the end cost more if not properly prepared for. At these times, he argues, it is necessary for the people to cooperate by paying taxes created to cover these precautionary expenses. He emphasizes how important it is for the government to be careful in choosing the items that will be taxed, but also reminds the American people that, no matter how hard the government tries, there will never be a tax which is not inconvenient, unpleasant, or seemingly an insult to those who must pay it.|$|R
