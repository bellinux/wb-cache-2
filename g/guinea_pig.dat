The following observations were made: 1. The sera of germ-free <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs,</b> when infected with the organisms of Lactobacillus acidophilus, had a lower bactericidal power against strain 0 - 901 of Salmonella typhi than did those of the germ-free <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> infected with strain F 6 of Esch. coli.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the capacity of a live avirulent mutant form of the intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila to induce immune responses and protective immunity in <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs.</b> The mutant L. pneumophila is nonlethal to <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> and does not revert to virulence with passage through <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs.</b> In contrast, exposure of <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> to aerosols containing wild-type L. pneumophila induces a pneumonic illness that clinically and pathologically resembles Legionnaires' disease in humans. <b>Guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> immunized by aerosol exposure to mutant L. pneumophila developed a strong humoral immune response to wild-type L. pneumophila antigens with reciprocal antibody titers of 32 - 512 (median 256) by the indirect fluorescent antibody assay, compared with titers of less than 2 for control (sham immunized) <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs.</b> Mutant immunized but not control <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> also developed strong cell-mediated immune responses to wild-type L. pneumophila antigens, as demonstrated in assays of cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity and in vitro splenic lymphocyte proliferation.

5|$|Spanish, Dutch, and English traders brought {{guinea pigs}} to Europe, where they quickly became popular as exotic pets among {{the upper classes}} and royalty, {{including}} Queen Elizabeth I. The earliest known written account of the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> dates from 1547, in {{a description of the}} animal from Santo Domingo; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola, the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers. However, based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands, the animal must have been introduced by ceramic-making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC, and it was present in the Ostionoid period, for example, on Puerto Rico, long before the advent of the Spaniards. The <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner. Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777; it is an amalgam of Pallas' generic designation (1766) and Linnaeus' specific conferral (1758). The earliest known illustration of a domestic <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> is a painting (artist unknown) {{in the collection of the}} National Portrait Gallery in London, dated to 1580, which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise-shell <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> in her hands; she is flanked by her two brothers, one of whom holds a pet bird.

5|$|Guinea pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig.</b> Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible.

5|$|The <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> is able {{to breed}} year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; {{as many as five}} litters can be {{produced}} per year. The gestation period lasts from 59–72 days, with an average of 63–68 days. Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and eggplant-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies. Unlike the offspring of most other rodents, which are altricial at birth, newborn pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight; they are immediately mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to suckle. Litters yield one to six pups, with an average of three; the largest recorded litter size is 17. The <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> mother only has two nipples, but she can readily raise the more average-sized litters of 2 to 4 piglets.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> {{are infected with}} infl uenza virus in nature, we conducted a serologic study in domestic <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> in Ecuador. Detection of antibodies against infl uenza A and B raises {{the question about the}} role of <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> in the ecology and epidemiology of infl uenza virus in the region. Influenza A virus infection causes disease in humans and domestic animals, including pigs, horses, and chickens, and seasonal epidemics among humans in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres result in hospitalizations and deaths worldwide. Influenza A virus transmission studies are often conducted in laboratory <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> (1, 2) because the virus can efficiently spread from infected animals to naive <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> by direct and indirect (short-range infectious aerosols) contact (3, 4). However, whether <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> are naturally infected with influenza virus outside the laboratory setting is not known. In some regions of South America, <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> are part of the traditional cuisine and are produced as livestock and sold commercially for human consumption. <b>Guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> are customarily raised on small rural farms in proximity to other livestock. Circulation of influenza virus in these populations has not been studied. Given the effect of influenza virus on human health and the susceptibility of <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> to influenza virus infection in the laboratory, it is worthwhile to {{determine whether}} influenza virus can spread among <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> in agricultural settings.

Finally, OA can also be induced in <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> via surgical methods, for instance meniscectomy [8]. <b>Guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> are a good choice for medial meniscitomy studies because both <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> and human beings tend to load the medial meniscus more than the lateral meniscus, so destabilizing the medial meniscus will lead to a similar disease progression [8].|$|R
