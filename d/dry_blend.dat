Our overall objective has been to develop cost-effective flame-retarded and antistatic polyethylene compounds suitable for rotomolding. This communication considers the surface resistivity and mechanical properties of rotationally molded linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) /graphite composites containing natural Zimbabwean graphite, expandable graphite, or expanded graphite. <b>Dry</b> <b>blending</b> and melt compounding were employed to obtain antistatic composites at the lowest graphite contents. <b>Dry</b> <b>blending</b> {{was found to be}} an effective mixing method for rotomolding antistatic LLDPE/graphite composites, thereby eliminating an expensive compounding step. Dry-blended Zimbabwean graphite composites showed the lowest surface resistivity at all graphite contents, with a surface resistivity of 105 Ω/square at 10 wt% loading. Although rotomolded powders obtained following the melt compounding of Zimbabwean graphite exhibited higher resistivity values, the variability was much lower. Injection molding resulted in surface resistivity values above 1014 Ω/square for all compositions used. The rotomolded composites exhibited poor mechanical properties, in contrast to injection-molded composites.

40|$|The polymer phase {{separation}} of P(VDF-TrFE) :F 8 BT blends is studied in detail. Its morphology {{is key to}} the operation and performance of memory diodes. In this study, it is demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} direct the semiconducting domains of a phase-separating mixture of P(VDF-TrFE) and F 8 BT in a thin film into a highly ordered 2 D lattice by means of surface directed {{phase separation}}. Numerical simulation of the surface-controlled de-mixing process provides insight in the ability of the substrate pattern to direct the phase separation, and hence the regularity of the domain pattern in the final <b>dry</b> <b>blend</b> layer. By optimizing the ratio of the blend components, the number of electrically active semiconductor domains is maximized. Pattern replication on a cm-scale is achieved, and improved functional device performance is demonstrated in the form of a 10 -fold increase of the ON-current and a sixfold increase in current modulation. This approach therefore provides a simple and scalable means to higher density integration, the ultimate target being a single semiconducting domain per memory cell.

40|$|Plans for {{disposal}} of the low-level fraction of selected double-shell tank wastes at Hanford include grouting. Grout disposal {{is the process}} of mixing low-level liquid waste with cementitious powders and pumping the slurry to near-surface, underground concrete vaults; hydration results in the formation of a solid product that binds/encapsulates the radioactive/hazardous constituents.

Major conclusions: grouts from dry blends with 40 wt% limestone had lower strengths; compressive strengths and leach resistance decreased with increased curing temperature/time; leach resistance increased for grouts prepared with dilute DSSF; nitrate leach resistance increased with high slag/cement ratios, dilute DSSF, and low curing temperatures; amount of drainable liquids for grouts using diluted DSSF was lowest when slag content was high; the 2 most significant factors affecting grout properties were the slag/cement ratio and waste dilution (slag-waste reactions appear to dominate the properties of DSSF grouts) ...|$|E

We will study how the solid-state shear ball milling is employed to prepare the polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan hydrogel crosslinked without using the crosslinking agent. The PVA/CS was characterized by LDS, X-ray diffraction, FTIR and SEM. The results revealed that {{during the process of}} ball milling at ambient temperature, a PVA/CS blending can be effectively pulverized resulting in crosslinking of PVA/CS hydrogel having nanosized particles. Also, the removal of Mn (II) ion {{has been found to be}} pH, adsorbent dosage and contact time dependent and the optimum pH was 6. 0. From the testing of equilibrium data by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, it was found that the adsorption equilibrium was fitted well by Freundlich isotherm model. In addition, the kinetic adsorption was fitted well by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The thermodynamic study indicated that the adsorption of Mn (II) ion onto PVA/CS was spontaneous and endothermic in nature. Also, it showed that the PVA/CS binary blend was a good adsorbent for the removal of Mn (II) ion from aqueous solution...|$|E

The processing of compounds of poly(vinyl chloride) {{in the form}} of a <b>dry</b> <b>blend</b> with silica–lignin hybrid material and, separately, with the two components from which that material was prepared, was performed in a Brabender mixing chamber.

Additionally, the effects of filler content on the fusion characteristics of PVC composites were investigated. The homogeneity of dispersion of the silica–lignin hybrid material in the PVC matrix was determined by optical microscopy and SEM. Finally, it should be noted that it is possible to obtain a PVC composite containing up to 10 wt % of silica–lignin filler using a melt processing method.
