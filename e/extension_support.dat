25|$|The FAT {{file system}} {{itself does not}} impose any limits on the depth of a {{subdirectory}} tree {{for as long as}} there are free clusters available to allocate the subdirectories, however, the internal Current Directory Structure (CDS) under MS-DOS/PCDOS limits the absolute path of a directory to 66 characters (including the drive letter, but excluding the NUL byte delimiter), thereby limiting the maximum supported depth of subdirectories to 32, whatever occurs earlier. Concurrent DOS, MultiuserDOS and DRDOS3.31 to 6.0 (up to including the 1992-11 updates) do not store absolute paths to working directories internally and therefore do not show this limitation. The same applies to Atari GEMDOS, but the Atari Desktop does not support more than 8 sub-directory levels. Most applications aware of this <b>extension</b> <b>support</b> paths up to at least 127bytes. FlexOS, 4680OS and 4690OS support a length of up to 127bytes as well, allowing depths down to 60 levels. PalmDOS, DRDOS6.0 (since BDOS7.1) and higher, NovellDOS, and OpenDOS sport a MS-DOS-compatible CDS and therefore have the same length limits as MS-DOS/PCDOS.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of iOS 10 {{were mostly}} positive. Reviewers {{highlighted}} the significant updates to iMessage, Siri, Photos, 3D Touch, and the lock screen as welcome changes. The third-party <b>extension</b> <b>support</b> to iMessage meant it was [...] "becoming a platform", although the user interface {{was criticized for}} being difficult to understand. Third-party integration in Siri was [...] "great", although the voice assistant was criticized for not having become smarter than before.

The lock screen was [...] "far more customizable than before", and reviewers enjoyed that notification bubbles could be expanded to see more information without needing to unlock the phone.|$|E

Its version number, 1607, means that it was supposed to launch in July 2016, however it was delayed until August [...] 2016. Tons of new features were included in the version, including more integration with Cortana, a dark theme, browser <b>extension</b> <b>support</b> for Microsoft Edge, click-to-play Flash by default, tab pinning, web notifications, swipe navigation in Edge, and the ability for Windows Hello to use a fingerprint sensor to sign into apps and websites, similar to Touch ID on the iPhone. Also added was Windows Ink, which improves digital inking in many apps, and the Windows Ink Workspace which lists pen-compatible apps, as well as quick shortcuts to a sticky notes app and a sketchpad. Microsoft, through their partnership with Canonical, integrated a full Ubuntu bash shell via the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Notable tweaks in this version of Windows 10 include the removal of the controversial password-sharing feature of Microsoft's Wi-Fi Sense service, a slightly redesigned Start menu, Tablet Mode working more like Windows 8, overhauled emoji, improvements to the lock screen, calendar integration in the taskbar, and the Blue Screen of Death now showing a QR code which users can scan to quickly find out what caused the error.

50|$|Persistent {{connection}} support {{was introduced in}} PHP 5.3 for the MySQLi <b>extension.</b> <b>Support</b> was already present in PDO MYSQL and ext/mysql. The idea behind persistent connections is that a connection between a client process and a database can be reused by a client process, rather than being created and destroyed multiple times. This reduces the overhead of creating fresh connections every time one is required, as unused connections are cached and ready to be reused.|$|E

50|$|At {{the heart}} of the {{agricultural}} value chain concept is the idea of actors connected along a chain producing and delivering goods to consumers through a sequence of activities. However, this “vertical” chain cannot function in isolation and an important aspect of the value chain approach is that it also considers “horizontal” impacts on the chain, such as input and finance provision, <b>extension</b> <b>support</b> and the general enabling environment. The approach has been found useful, particularly by donors, in that it has resulted in a consideration of all those factors impacting on the ability of farmers to access markets profitably, leading to a broader range of chain interventions. It is used both for upgrading existing chains and for donors to identify market opportunities for small farmers.|$|E
50|$|ICTs {{are also}} being used to {{strengthen}} the capacity of extension officers and NGO field staff to reach farmers with timely and accurate information and, at the same time, help capture data from the field. The Grameen Foundation’s Community Knowledge Worker (CKW) programme is an example. Farmer representatives are trained to use ICT applications on a smartphone to provide agricultural information and <b>extension</b> <b>support.</b> Most market price information is now delivered to farmers via SMS. Further along the chain, technologies offer considerable possibilities to enhance traceability, which is particularly relevant as certification grows in importance. Where necessary many exporters can now trace consignments back to individual farmers and take necessary measures to address problems. Finally, systems such as FARA’s eRails are also supporting agricultural researchers through {{data collection and analysis}} and access to up-to-date research publications.|$|E
