5|$|Instead of withdrawing, the British {{remained}} in a forward line of trenches and redoubts. The regiment positioned itself around Karim Abu El Hiseia, on the Wadi Ghuzze. McCarroll assumed {{command of the}} regiment again, Mackesy being appointed as the administrator of the Khan Yunus-Deir and the Belah region. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> patrol duty was interspersed with occupying the front line and training.|$|E
5|$|After Combat Rock, the Clash {{began to}} disintegrate. Headon {{was asked to}} leave the band just before the album's release because heroin {{addiction}} was damaging his health and drumming. Chimes was brought back to drum <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months.</b> The loss of Headon, well-liked by the others, exposed growing friction within the band. Jones and Strummer began to feud. The band opened for the Who on a leg of their final tour in the US, including a show at New York's Shea Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} German counterattack came in early February, {{was against the}} British 1st Division. Two regiments of the 45th (the 179th and 157th Infantry) {{were sent to the}} Aprilia sector to {{reinforce}} the British. The 179th Infantry and a tank battalion of CCA tried to recapture Aprilia but were repulsed. Lucas then moved the rest of the 45th Division to the left-center of the perimeter, at Aprilia and along the west branch of the Mussolini Canal. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> the 45th Infantry Division was mostly stuck in place, holding its ground during repeated German counterattacks, and subjected to bombardment from aircraft and artillery.|$|E

5|$|Connecticut {{departed}} Philadelphia for California on 4 October {{for duty}} with the Pacific Fleet. After touching at San Diego on the 27th, she arrived on 28 October at San Pedro, where Rear Admiral H.O. Stickney designated her the flagship of Pacific Fleet Training. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> Connecticut cruised along the West Coast, {{taking part in}} exercises and commemorations. Under {{the terms of the}} Washington Naval Treaty, which set tonnage limits for its signatory nations, the Navy designated Connecticut for scrapping. Getting under way for her final voyage on 11 December, she made a five-day journey to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, where she was decommissioned on 1 March 1923. On 1 November, the ex-Connecticut was sold for scrap to Walter W. Johnson of San Francisco for the sum of $42,750.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a request from the New Zealand government, Barrowclough was nominated by Freyberg for command of the Pacific Section of 2NZEF, which was based in Fiji. With the entry of Imperial Japan into the war, this was an important command as Fiji was {{the last line of}} defence for mainland New Zealand. Barrowclough embarked for New Zealand in early 1942 but during his transit, the commanding officer of the Pacific Section became seriously ill and was invalided home to be immediately replaced by Major General Owen Mead. On Barrowclough's arrival in New Zealand, he was disappointed to find that his expected command was no longer available. He was eventually posted as the commander of the Northern Division with the rank of major general. He was responsible for the defence of the upper North Island, and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> oversaw the reorganisation and training of his new command.|$|E
5|$|The planned {{movement}} of the 20th Division to Madang was revised {{in the light of}} events in the Bismarck Sea. The operation was postponed for two days, and the destination was altered from Madang to Hansa Bay further west. To reduce the Allied air threat, the Allied airfield at Wau was bombed on 9 March, and that at Dobodura on 11 March. Three Allied aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and one P-40 was lost in the air, but the Allied fighters claimed to have shot down nine Japanese planes. The transports reached Hansa Bay unscathed on 12 March, and the troops made their way down to Madang on foot or in barges. The 20th Division then became involved in an attempt to construct a road from Madang to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys. It toiled on the road <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> but its efforts were ultimately frustrated by New Guinea's weather and the rugged terrain of the Finisterre Range.|$|E

5|$|Connecticut {{then went}} to Maine and the Virginia Capes for battle practice, after which {{she went into the}} Philadelphia Naval Yard for an overhaul. After more than 15 weeks, Connecticut emerged on 15 January 1915 and steamed south to Cuba, where she {{conducted}} training exercises. During maneuvers there in March 1915, a chain wrapped around her starboard propeller, breaking the shaft and forcing her return to Philadelphia for repairs. She remained there until 31 July, when she embarked 433 men from the Second Regiment, First Brigade, of the United States Marine Corps for transport to Port-au-Prince, where they were put ashore on 5 August as part of the US occupation of Haiti. Connecticut delivered supplies to amphibious troops in Cap-Ha√Øtien on 5 September and remained near Haiti <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> supporting landing parties ashore, including detachments of Marines and sailors from Connecticut under the command of Major Smedley Butler. After departing Haiti, Connecticut arrived in Philadelphia on 15 December and was placed into the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, DiBiase {{signed a}} {{developmental}} deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and debuted in their training territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). He made his FCW debut on August 4 in a tag team match, {{in which he}} and Jake Hager defeated Keith Walker and Heath Miller. In October, DiBiase {{became a member of}} the Next Generation Hart Foundation faction alongside Harry Smith, TJ Wilson, Nattie Neidhart, and Teddy Hart. He quickly separated from the group, however, and gained Maryse as a valet. On December 18, 2007, DiBiase defeated TJ Wilson to win the FCW Southern Heavyweight Championship in New Port Richey, Florida. DiBiase, however, was unable to defend it due to an injury sustained, so he awarded the championship to his partner Heath Miller on January 19, 2008. As of March 2008, DiBiase had suffered from a multitude of injuries including sciatica, a fractured left knee, separated ribs, broken finger, and bone spurs in his elbow. Due to these injuries, DiBiase competed sporadically in FCW <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> competing in both tag team and singles competition.|$|E
5|$|In early 2009, Torres began a scripted {{feud with}} Michelle McCool after McCool {{attacked}} her. On the February 6 episode of SmackDown, Eve made her singles match debut in a losing effort against McCool via submission. Their feud continued <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> {{with the two}} competing {{against each other in}} singles and tag team matches. In mid-2009, Eve started competing in dance and arm wrestling competitions against Layla, later defeating her on the May 29 episode of SmackDown in a singles match. On the June 18 episode of Superstars, Eve pinned Layla once again. After the match, they both shook hands. Around the same as her scripted rivalry with Layla, Eve became associated with Cryme Tyme (Shad and JTG), where Torres accompanied them to the ring as their manager. Eve and Cryme Tyme then participated in multiple six-person mixed tag team matches against The Hart Dynasty (David Hart Smith, Tyson Kidd, and Natalya), with Eve also facing Natalya in singles and tag team matches involving other Divas. Her final match on SmackDown was on October 9, when she was defeated in a singles match by McCool.|$|E

5|$|New Ironsides {{completed}} her overhaul in late August 1864, {{now under the}} command of Commodore William Radford, but did not join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in Hampton Roads until October when her crew finished gunnery training. She participated in a major assault in December on Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in an effort to stop blockade running into the port of Wilmington. Though this attack was called off on Christmas Day after an extensive bombardment, the Union fleet returned to resume the operation on 13 January 1865. New Ironsides was one of several warships that heavily shelled Fort Fisher, preparing the way for a ground assault that captured the position on 15 January. Afterward and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> New Ironsides supported Union activities on the James River. She was decommissioned on 6 April 1865 and was laid up at League Island, Philadelphia, where, on the night of 16 December 1865, New Ironsides was destroyed by a fire. The ship was towed to shallow water where she burned and sank. Her wreck was salvaged and her boilers were offered for sale in 1869.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> Cranmer and {{the king}} worked on {{establishing}} legal procedures on how the monarch's marriage would be judged by his most senior clergy. Several drafts of the procedures have been preserved in letters written between the two. Once the procedures were agreed, Cranmer opened his court on 10 May, inviting Henry and Catherine of Aragon to appear. Gardiner represented the king; Catherine did not appear or send a proxy. On 23 May Cranmer pronounced the judgement that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God. He even issued a threat of excommunication if Henry did not stay away from Catherine. Henry was now free to marry and, on 28 May, Cranmer validated Henry and Anne's marriage. On 1 June, Cranmer personally crowned and anointed Anne queen and delivered to her the sceptre and rod. Pope Clement VII was furious at this defiance, {{but he could not}} take decisive action as he was pressured by other monarchs to avoid an irreparable breach with England. However, on 9 July he provisionally excommunicated Henry and his advisers (which included Cranmer) unless he repudiated Anne by the end of September. Henry kept Anne as his wife and, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Elizabeth. Cranmer baptised her immediately afterwards and acted as one of her godparents.|$|E
