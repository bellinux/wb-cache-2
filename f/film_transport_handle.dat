40|$|The LHC cryodipoles will be <b>transported</b> and <b>handled</b> {{to their}} final {{position}} in the tunnel and, therefore, they will be subjected to dynamic loads that could damage the dipoles cold masses and cryostats components. The dynamic behaviour of the LHC cryodipoles should be considered when designing the <b>transport</b> and <b>handling</b> equipment. To predict the dynamic behaviour of the cryodipoles under <b>transport</b> and <b>handling</b> conditions, a finite element model of the LHC 15 m cryodipole was developed and validated with experimental data. The natural frequencies and mode shapes predicted by the model were in good agreement with experimental data. The model was used to simulate both a transport on a truck and a handling with a crane of the cryodipole assembly...|$|R
