Over the last 12 months, I have constantly pressed the case for reform of world trade rules to give the poorest people on the planet a chance to sell their products and improve their quality of life. The plight of the people of Darfur, Western Sudan, has also been a regular theme. They have suffered too much for too long with too little done about the situation. I shall go on arguing for Britain {{to take the lead in}} the international community in seeking decisive action for peace and justice.|$|E

500|$|Hillary Goldstein of IGN {{praised the}} comic book, {{saying that it}} [...] "is truly {{the cream of the}} crop when it comes to Vertigo books. Neil Gaiman's work on the series is {{considered}} legendary for a reason. This story, in its entirety, is every bit as good as Watchmen and of equal (if not greater) literary merit. Were I to list the 100 best single comic-book <b>issues</b> <b>I</b> have ever read, three would come from this collection. Whether you have read The Sandman before or are a first timer, this is the one book you need to buy this fall. The stories within are magnificent and the care taken in reproducing Gaiman's work is the same you'd expect for any great work of literature." ...|$|E
500|$|Of {{his career}} in the Senate, Ford said [...] "I wasn't {{interested}} in national <b>issues.</b> <b>I</b> was interested in Kentucky issues." [...] Nevertheless, he influenced several important pieces of federal legislation. He sponsored an amendment to the Family Medical Leave Act exempting businesses with fewer than fifty employees. He was a key player in securing passage of the motor voter law in 1993. He supported increases to the federal minimum wage and a 1996 welfare reform bill. A supporter of research into clean coal technology, he also worked with West Virginia senator Jay Rockefeller to secure better retirement benefits for coal miners. Never known as a major player on international issues, Ford favored continued economic sanctions against Iraq {{as an alternative to the}} Gulf War. He voted against the Panama Canal Treaty, which he perceived to be unpopular with Kentucky voters. Despite having chaired Bill Clinton's inaugural committee in 1993, Ford broke with the administration by voting against the North American Free Trade Agreement [...]|$|E
500|$|After Rowan County clerk Kim Davis defied Judge David L. Bunning's {{order to}} issue {{marriage}} licenses to same-sex couples, Bevin commended her [...] "willingness {{to stand for}} her First Amendment rights". Davis was confined to the Carter County jail for six days on contempt of court charges for refusing to comply with Bunning's order. On September 8, 2015, Bevin met with Davis in the jail and later attended a rally organized by Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee celebrating her subsequent release. Following a September debate at Bellarmine University, Bevin said, [...] "My intention {{has always been to}} execute this race on financial issues, on economic issues. In the last several weeks, 85 percent of what people talk about are these social <b>issues.</b> ... <b>I</b> think the issue has redefined this race whether any of us candidates want {{that to be the case}} or not." [...] Associated Press reporter Adam Beam wrote that the Davis case [...] "ignited the passions of religious conservatives in an already conservative state", and University of Kentucky political science professor Stephen Voss opined that a campaign focused on cultural and social issues would be [...] "bad for Conway".|$|E

500|$|Westley {{subsequently}} {{went about}} overhauling the squad {{ahead of the}} 2012–13 season. In May 2012, Preston announced that 21 players would be leaving the club; 14 of which were released {{at the end of}} their contracts, while a further seven were transfer-listed. Preston signed 18 players during the summer transfer window, including Scott Laird, John Mousinho, Joel Byrom, and [...] Chris Beardsley, four players from Westley's former club, Stevenage. Westley stated a desire for the new group of players to be committed to his ideas [...] "My job is to develop a plan that would see the club back on an upward curve. The plan is in place. I'm looking forward to working with a group that thinks along the same lines that I do". Preston started the season well, beating Championship side Huddersfield Town 2–0 at Deepdale in the League Cup. Later on in the month, Preston went on to secure consecutive 4–1 home victories, beating Crystal Palace and Swindon Town respectively, as well as defeating Hartlepool United 5–0 a month later. However, the club went on to win just two leagues matches in a four-month period from October 2012 to February 2013. A day after Preston's 3–1 away defeat to Yeovil Town on 12 February 2013, the club released a statement announcing Westley had been sacked. With Preston sitting just five points above the relegation zone, it was revealed that [...] "the board felt that a change of manager was the only way forward". On his time at Preston, Westley stated he had to [...] "slash the wage bill by 60 percent", and as a result the [...] "re-building was well underway but the club lost confidence in me whilst I was doing it. They just want results. Short-term pain is necessary sometimes. It was necessary at Preston. And the fans got restless. I get that. Just as managers have to be brave enough to grit their teeth and face up to that, so owners have to be brave at difficult times. And they have to be able to understand the <b>issues.</b> <b>I</b> knew the answers to problems but I wasn't being allowed to solve all the problems".|$|E

2500|$|Days before Swartz's funeral, Lawrence Lessig eulogized {{his friend}} and {{sometime}} client in an essay, Prosecutor as Bully. He decried the disproportionality of Swartz's prosecution and said, [...] "The question this government needs to answer is {{why it was so}} necessary that Aaron Swartz be labeled a 'felon'. For in the 18 months of negotiations, that was what he was not willing to accept." [...] Cory Doctorow wrote, [...] "Aaron had an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and intelligence about people and <b>issues.</b> <b>I</b> think he could have revolutionized American (and worldwide) politics.

The business and enterprise secretary, John Hutton, responded in a Radio 4 interview [...] "It is not the government that has got a closed view on these <b>issues,</b> <b>I</b> think it is organisations like Greenpeace that have got a closed mind.

2500|$|A January 24 {{debate at}} Florida Atlantic University was sedate, {{with none of}} the {{candidates}} attacking each other and economics the predominant theme. By the next day, however, McCain and Romney were going at each other, with McCain accusing Romney of having once advocated timetables for withdrawal from Iraq, and Romney saying that was untrue — an assessment shared by news organizations, which labeled McCain's charge as misleading—and demanding an apology. Certain statements dogged McCain. NBC News' Tim Russert during a debate raised a McCain quote in which McCain said, [...] "I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy <b>issues.</b> <b>I</b> still need to be educated." ...|$|E

Cox noted that the comment characterizing the est organization as a [...] "destructive cult" [...] came from [...] "a credible source", Los Angeles magazine, {{and that it was}} properly quoted. Referring to Rosenberg's involvement in the Erhard-related organization The Hunger Project, Cox said: [...] "(Rosenberg) claimed to be a leader in one of the foremost organizations devoted to solving world hunger.
