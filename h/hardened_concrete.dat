40|$|Since the {{durability}} depends, among other things, {{on the quality}} of the concrete and presence of cracks, it is necessary to calculate the probability of cracking in <b>hardening</b> <b>concrete</b> as reliable as possible in case of durability predictions. In this thesis, it is investigated how the accuracy of stress prediction in <b>hardening</b> <b>concrete</b> can be improved by a more detailed description of microstructural and transport phenomen. First it is described how hydration of cement and the microstructural development can be described. Two basically different models for cement hydration are explained, which introduced the possibility to couple results and information from the simulations with accurately property development of <b>hardening</b> <b>concrete</b> (strength, stiffness, porosity), however, the relation between visco-elastic behavior of <b>hardening</b> <b>concrete</b> and the microstructural development is still under development. Some history of development of visco-elastic models is presented, from which it turned out that there is a need for a step forward in understanding and explicit modeling of visco-elastic behavior of <b>hardening</b> <b>concrete,</b> by taking into account the microstructural development of hardening cement paste and moisture movements in order to make stress predictions in <b>hardening</b> <b>concrete</b> elements more accurate and reliable. The moisture state is modeled explicitly in the solidification theory by including hollow permeable shells in a microstructural hydration model. A hollow shell, or annular space, is defined as the zone between an anhydrous cement grain and the gel shell. This space is filled with water. The Shell Deformation Model (SDM) as developed in this thesis relates the time dependent deformations of a loaded cement paste to the transport of load bearing water inside the shell of cement gel to the capillary pores. The model assumes equal time dependent deformations for cement paste loaded in tension and compression. From the simulated results, it turned out that the fineness of cement does not influence the visco-elastic behavior of <b>hardening</b> <b>concrete.</b> In order to obtain reliable and accurate results from the proposed model, the moisture state in the capillary pores is considered accurately. For this purpose, moisture movements are modeled at microlevel. Due to the inhomogeneous distribution of cement particles in the cement paste between the aggregates, pressure differences exist between water in the pores of cement paste located near the aggregates and the water in the pores of cement paste in-between the aggregates. A model is developed which describe pressure driven moisture movements based on the conservation of volume. The influence of capillary water transport on visco-elastic behaviour of hardening cement paste is studied. Taking those movements into account, an influence up to 8 % on the visco-elastic behaviour is observed. The differences are bigger for higher water/cement ratio’s and arise earlier for higher Blaine values of the used cement. As a first validation of the proposed model, two test series are performed. First test serie contains sustained loading experiments. The results are used to study the influence of the cement fineness and to study the influence of the load sign. Result of this program is that no influence on the visco-elastic behaviour can be ascribed to both parameters. Second test serie contains degree of restraint experiments to validate the Shell Deformation Model. For three mixtures with different cement finenesses, it turned out that stress predictions are predicted more accurate by using the proposed Shell Deformation Model (SDM) compared to a model previously proposed.

40|$|Every year roughly 2 % to 10 % of the {{estimated}} 455 million cubic yards of ready mixed concrete produced in the USA (est. 2006) is returned to the concrete plant. The crushed returned concrete aggregate (CCA) is obtained from crushing the returned concrete that was discharged at the concrete pant and left {{for a period of}} time before crushing. It is estimated that about 60 % of all returned concrete is managed with this manner by the concrete plant according to the national ready mixed concrete association report. But the reuse of the returned concrete aggregate is very much limited so that most of the returned concrete aggregate has been diverted to the landfill. The main obstacle to limit the use of the returned concrete aggregate is the current type of prescriptive specifications by controlling the concrete composition, which limits the ability to optimize concrete mixtures for performance. The CCA aggregate has useful aggregate properties among which it is free of any contamination. Thus, CCA aggregate is distinguished from other recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) that comes out of existing old structures with high contamination from many years of exposure during the service life. The objective of this research was to develop technical data that will support the use of the CCA aggregates from the returned concrete by the ready mixed concrete industry. Three CCA aggregates at three strength levels were characterized. Thereafter, the virgin coarse/fine aggregates and the three CCA aggregates were used with various amounts to prepare concrete mixtures so as to investigate the effect on the fresh and <b>harden</b> <b>concrete</b> properties. The second objective of this research was to develop the performance models of <b>harden</b> <b>concrete</b> properties. The <b>harden</b> <b>concrete</b> properties of a selected number of mixtures containing CCA aggregates were used for the modeling of compressive strength, drying shrinkage, elastic modulus, and rapid chloride ion penetrability.

The fine CCA aggregates were further investigated for their potential use as internal curing agent due to their unique aggregate properties (i. e. low specific gravity and high water absorption capacity). Those two properties are crucial factors for the internal curing. The fine CCA aggregates were used with mortar mixtures to evaluate the strength and autogenous shrinkage behavior along with the lightweight fine aggregate. This new approach can promote the use of CCA aggregate in a specialized application. Another objective of this study was to demonstrate the advantages of using a performance based specification.

40|$|The {{start of}} the {{chemical}} reaction between cement and water is the moment that concrete starts to develop its properties. More precisely, it is the paste that starts to generate a loadbearing microstructure that exhibits {{a certain number of}} mechanical properties. One of the properties generated during hardening is the so-called hardening shrinkage. Quite often, this property is measured from <b>hardening</b> <b>concrete</b> by linear measurements and related to the paste deformation by using mathematical models. The opposite way, by measuring the paste deformation and relate it to the deformation of concrete is another possibility that can be applied. In the paper, a new apparatus called “mini-TSTM” (Thermal Stress Testing Machine) for measuring the hardening shrinkage of paste will be presented and discussed [1]. The device has been developed to measure the hardening deformations directly from the paste. It provides more insight in the contracting forces that act on the paste located in between the aggregates. The mini-TSTM is scaled down from the “full-scale” TSTM machine which is commonly used for measuring the thermal stresses of <b>hardening</b> <b>concrete</b> elements.
