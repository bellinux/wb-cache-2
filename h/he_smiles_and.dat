5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while making excuses for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and laugh at the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. <b>He</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
2500|$|The stark lyrics by Vedder for [...] "Even Flow" [...] {{describe}} {{the experience of}} being a homeless man. The subject sleeps [...] "on a pillow made of concrete" [...] and panhandles passersby for spare change. In addition to being illiterate, he may also be mentally ill, as he [...] "looks insane" [...] when <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> struggles to keep coherent thoughts ("Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies/Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away").|$|E
2500|$|... "The little picture {{which he}} is doing is of a Madonna seated {{as if she were}} about to spin yarn. The Child has placed his foot on the basket of yarns and has grasped the yarn-winder and gazes attentively at four spokes that are {{in the form of a}} cross. As if desirous of the cross <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> holds it firm, and is unwilling to yield it to his Mother who seems to want to takeit away from him." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> {{a charming}} <b>smile.</b> (<b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> his <b>smile</b> was charming.) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> {{lifting her}} hand to his lips, lightly kissed it.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> {{there was}} a shadow still of sadness in his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{say to him}} sometimes, 'Leon, {{you must}} be ruining yourself;' but <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> says, 'I am well content, captain; if you are satisfied, I am so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... (She tries {{hard not}} to smile, but she smiles and <b>he</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> they make comic faces at each other, as they have done in similar {{circumstances}} since she first opened her eyes.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{he brings}} home a {{sum of money}} every day--about thirty shillings--sometimes fifty: and then <b>he</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> says it's a good day's work. This is not like a forger," [...] said pore Mrs. A.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> {{with his}} stick traced a quaint {{pattern in the}} sand.|$|R
60|$|Skim frowned. Then <b>he</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>smile</b> {{disclosed}} a front tooth missing.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> looked earnestly for {{a moment}} at the dainty {{apparition}} before him.|$|R
60|$|Death appears {{behind him}} and {{encloses}} the uplifted hand in his. Appelles shudders, wearily and slowly turns, and recognises his life-long adversary. <b>He</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> puts all his gratitude into one simple and touching sentence, 'Ich danke dir,' and dies.|$|E
6000|$|Where {{the apples}} are heap'd on the barrows in piles, [...] You see him stop short, he looks long, and he smiles; [...] He looks, and <b>he</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> a Poet might spy [...] The image of fifty green fields in his eye.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have no fear," [...] she said. [...] "When Gallus {{looks so}} solemn he brings good tidings, for {{if they are}} bad <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> makes light of them," [...] and {{advancing}} she took him {{by the hand and}} led him past the porter's room into the atrium.|$|E
60|$|He {{had spoken}} his last words. <b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> I {{understood}} his touch {{to mean that}} he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid it there, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> again, <b>and</b> put both his hands upon it.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> {{assured her}} that {{whatever}} she wished him to say should be said.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> said I {{might make}} myself easy; {{he had told}} us the worst.|$|R
6000|$|Chef Ragozzi. With pomp {{of words}} beyond a soldier's cunning, [...] And shrugs and {{wrinkled}} brow, <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> whispers! [...] Talks in dark words of women's fancies; hints [...] 55 [...] That 'twere a useless and a cruel zeal [...] To rob a dying man of any hope, [...] However vain, that soothes him: and, in fine, [...] Denies all chance of offspring from the Queen.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{now they}} have {{let me come back}} to my Jock, and I see visibly his improvement. He holds out his hand, and <b>he</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> he speaks now and then, the dreadful oppression is gone, and all the {{dangerous}} symptoms are abating, and I cannot tell how happy and thankful we are. 'Send my love, and tell Sydney she has a blessed Monk,' he says, as he wakes, and sees me writing.|$|E
6000|$|Another {{interruption}} to my letter, {{caused by}} another {{change in the}} weather. The fog has vanished; the waiter is turning off the gas, and letting in the drab-coloured daylight. I ask him if it is still raining. <b>He</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> rubs his hands, and says, [...] "It looks like clearing up soon, sir." [...] This man's head is gray; he has been all his life a waiter in London--and he {{can still see the}} cheerful side of things. What native strength of mind cast away on a vocation that is unworthy of it! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> {{rested his}} hand for a moment once more upon her thin white fingers.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> {{left his}} {{sentence}} unfinished, <b>and</b> she <b>smiled</b> {{back at him}} to show she understood.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> shot as evil {{a glance}} at me as could come from his dark eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Deering agreed, but Jimmy {{thought he}} hesitated before he resumed: [...] "In some ways, the fellow's the {{standard}} type of highbrow Englishman. He's urbane and won't dispute; <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> lets you down. He wears the proper clothes {{and uses the}} proper talk. If you're his friend, he's charming; but that's not all the man. Stannard doesn't plunge; he calculates. He knows just {{where he wants to}} go and gets there. I guess if I was an obstacle, I'd pull out of his way. The man's fine, like tempered steel, and about as hard-- Well, the doctor stated you wanted quiet and I'll quit talking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Jimmy {{declared}} with a {{touch of}} enthusiasm Laura saw was sincere. [...] "Mr. Stannard has all the qualities I'd like to cultivate. My habit, so to speak, is to shove along laboriously; he gets where he wants without an effort. On the trains and steamers he gets for nothing things another couldn't buy, and at the hotel the waiters serve him first. People trust him and are keen about his society. He's urbane and polished, but when you go with him on the rocks you note his steely pluck. When I'm stuck and daunted <b>he</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> somehow I get up the awkward slab. Besides, he stands for much I wanted but couldn't get until he helped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary, he {{recognises}} {{them with}} effusion, especially in public: <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> bows and beckons {{across the street}} to them. But when they pass over he turns away, and he speedily loses them in the crowd. The recognition's purely spiritual--it isn't in the least social. So he leaves all his belongings to other people to take care of. He accepts favours, loans, sacrifices--all with nothing more deterrent than an agony of shame. Fortunately we're a little faithful band, and we do what we can." [...] I held my tongue about the natural children, engendered, to the number of three, in the wantonness of his youth. I only remarked that he did make efforts--often tremendous ones. [...] "But the efforts," [...] I said, [...] "never come to much: the only things that come to much are the abandonments, the surrenders." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a second}} Mr. Sumner was puzzled. Then <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> {{led the way}} to his private office.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wilmot did {{not look}} too hopeful, but <b>he</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> asked after Granny Hall, and the children.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} me over his cigarette, and I laughed at his quiet {{exposure}} of my modest pretence.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there is}} he who seeing {{the misfortune of}} that great one, tells himself that patriotism, judgment, industry, and eloquence will not suffice for him unless he himself can be loved. To do great things a man must have a great following, and to achieve {{that he must be}} popular. So <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> learns the {{necessary}} wiles. He is all for his country and his friends,--but for his friends first. He too must be eloquent and well instructed in the ways of Parliament, must be wise and diligent; but in all that he does and all that he says he must first study his party. It is well with him for a time;--but he has closed the door of his Elysium too rigidly. Those without gradually become stronger than his friends within, and so he falls.|$|E
6000|$|Cain. [...] You {{have said}} well; I will contain [...] My heart till then. <b>He</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> sleeps!--sleep on, [...] And smile, thou little, young inheritor [...] Of a world scarce less young: sleep on, and smile! [...] 20 [...] Thine are the hours and days when both are cheering [...] And innocent! thou hast not plucked the fruit-- [...] Thou know'st not thou art naked! Must the time [...] Come thou shalt be amerced for sins unknown, [...] Which were not thine nor mine? But now sleep on! [...] His cheeks are {{reddening}} into deeper smiles, [...] And shining lids are trembling o'er his long [...] Lashes,[125] dark as the cypress which waves o'er them; [...] Half open, from beneath them the clear blue [...] Laughs out, although in slumber. He must dream-- [...] 30 [...] Of what? Of Paradise!--Aye! dream of it, [...] My disinherited boy! 'Tis but a dream; [...] For never more thyself, thy sons, nor fathers, [...] Shall walk in that forbidden place of joy! ...|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT [quite touched, mutely {{offering}} him a cigar to console him, at which <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> shakes his head]. Yes, Mr Keegan: you're quite right. There's poetry in everything, even [looking absently into the cigar case] {{in the most}} modern prosaic things, {{if you know how}} to extract it [he extracts a cigar for himself and offers one to Larry, who takes it]. If I was to be shot for it I couldn't extract it myself; but that's where you come in, you see [roguishly, waking up from his reverie and bustling Keegan goodhumoredly]. And then I shall wake you up a bit. That's where I come in: eh? d'ye see? Eh? eh? [He pats him very pleasantly on the shoulder, half admiringly, half pityingly]. Just so, just so. [Coming back to business] By the way, I believe I can do better than a light railway here. There seems to be no question now that the motor boat has come to stay. Well, look at your magnificent river there, going to waste.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> {{taking the}} box from her hands, touched a little spring. Almost {{at once the}} lid flew open.|$|R
60|$|His voice {{died away}} abruptly. The {{expression}} on his face changed. <b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> this time the effort was obvious.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Tom knitted {{his brows}} a little, then <b>he</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> {{looked out over}} the flower-beds without saying anything.|$|R
