5000|$|The {{original}} hydropneumatic {{system used}} a vegetable oil liquide <b>hydraulique</b> végétal (LHV), {{similar to that}} used in other cars at the time, but later switched to a synthetic fluid liquide <b>hydraulique</b> synthétique (LHS). Both of these had the disadvantage that they are hygroscopic, {{as is the case with}} most brake fluids. Disuse allows water to enter the hydraulic components causing deterioration and expensive maintenance work. The difficulty with hygroscopic hydraulic fluid was exacerbated in the DS/ID due to the extreme rise and fall in the fluid level in the reservoir, which went from nearly full to nearly empty when the suspension extended to maximum height and the six accumulators in the system filled with fluid. With every [...] "inhalation" [...] of fresh moisture- (and dust-) laden air, the fluid absorbed more water.|$|R
50|$|In 1753, French {{engineer}} Bernard Forest de Bélidor published Architecture <b>Hydraulique</b> which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines. By {{the late}} nineteenth century, the electric generator was developed by {{a team led by}} project managers and prominent pioneers of renewable energy Jacob S.

50|$|After {{leaving the}} navy de Pierrefeu devoted himself {{in part to}} applied science and technology, in {{particular}} to urban planning, and in part to intellectual speculation inspired by the symbolism of numbers and forms. In August 1924 he married Fanita d'Onthcorn. As an engineer, de Pierrefeu was prime contractor for the Oued-Beth Dam {{in the region of}} Meknes, Morocco.He then became director of the company Grands travaux <b>hydrauliques</b> de Marseille (Great Hydraulic Works of Marseille).|$|E
5000|$|In 1954, Frenchman Paul Magès {{developed}} a functioning air/oil hydropneumatic suspension, incorporating {{the advantages of}} earlier air suspension concepts. [...] Citroën replaced the conventional steel springs on the rear axle of their top-of-range model, the Traction Avant 15 <b>Hydraulique.</b> In 1955, the Citroën DS incorporated four wheel hydropneumatic suspension. This combined a very soft, comfortable suspension, with controlled movements, for sharp handling, together with a self-levelling suspension.|$|R
50|$|In 1886 {{the company}} was renamed {{becoming}} Société anonyme Électricité et <b>Hydraulique</b> à Charleroi (E&H), {{by this time the}} factory was producing dynamos with over 100 kW power. By 1900 the company had supplied electric lighting to the cities of Liege, Charleroi and Schaerbeek, and opened a new 50 ha factory in Marcinelle/Marchienne. In 1904 the company supplied trams for a line in Cointe, Liege- - the first entirely Belgian built trams.|$|R
50|$|To {{overcome}} these shortcomings of LHS, Citroën {{developed a new}} green fluid, LHM (Liquide <b>Hydraulique</b> Minéral). LHM is a mineral oil, quite close to automatic transmission fluid. Mineral oil is hydrophobic, unlike standard brake fluid; therefore, gas bubbles do not form in the system, as {{would be the case}} with standard brake fluid, creating a 'spongy' brake feel. Use of mineral oil has thus spread beyond Citroën, Rolls-Royce, Peugeot, and Mercedes-Benz, to include Jaguar, Audi, and BMW.|$|R
50|$|The {{experiments}} of JB Francis (Lowell Hydraulic Experiments, Boston, Mass., 1855) led him {{to propose}} variations in the accepted formulae for the discharge over weirs, and a generation later a very complete investigation of this subject {{was carried out by}} H Bazin. An elaborate inquiry on the flow of water in pipes and channels was conducted by HGP Darcy (1803-1858) and continued by H Bazin, {{at the expense of the}} French government (Recherches <b>hydrauliques,</b> Paris, 1866).|$|E
50|$|JNP Hachette in 1816-1817 {{published}} memoirs {{containing the}} results of experiments on the spouting of fluids and the discharge of vessels. His object was to measure the contracted part of a fluid vein, to examine the phenomena attendant on additional tubes, and to investigate {{the form of the}} fluid vein and the results obtained when different forms of orifices are employed. Extensive experiments on the discharge of water from orifices (Experiences <b>hydrauliques,</b> Paris, 1832) were conducted {{under the direction of the}} French government by JV Poncelet (1788-1867) and JA Lesbros (1790-1860).|$|E

40|$|CTA has {{published}} two books which describe examples of successful development. All too often such projects are not {{brought to the}} attention of wider audiences, mainly because developers are more concerned with matters of more immediate concern. The first book concerns village irrigation in the Sahel. It describes nine examples from three areas, each typical of its geographical location, with the potential for being copied and used elsewhere. The authors compare the results of the projects with the objectives, and describe the socio-economic conditions of the new rural communities which have been created. The second book covers a micro-hydraulic project in Madagascar which is now ten years old and which has improved the small-scale irrigated rice-growing areas by allowing farmers better control of the available water. The operation was cheap, efficient, successful and sustainable, and could be replicated elsewhere.

40|$|The Economic Mentalité and Great Hydrological Works At the Origins of a Model: The Drainage of Lake Fucino Swamplands {{have long}} been {{regarded}} as undesirable ecological features and their drainage a wholly beneficial operation. In modern times, the disappearance of marshes has been advanced as a benefit brought by conquering European societies to colonial peoples. As in many other cases, the Roman precedent has been widely cited. Yet a close examination of the historical record indicates that the comparison of modern with Roman imperial ends and methods is not entirely accurate. This becomes especially apparent {{when we consider the}} draining of Lake Fucino, an enormous undertaking that serves as a point of reference for modern engineers. Still, with respect to the means at their disposal and their objectives, the Emperor Claudius and his successors did not fail; rather, the results are not what we would expect when those expectations are based on the observation of modern drainage operations.

40|$|Some of the {{important}} elements to be considered by the designer {{in the field of}} water defenses and hydraulic structures include the determination of the maximum environmental loads such as maximum wave height, maximum water level and maximum river discharge at locations of interest. These maxima can be estimated by various statistical methods based on observations. The main point of interest is the behaviour of each method for predicting these extrema and its deviation from the true value. An overview of statistical methods is given to determine the extreme values of river and sea related variables. The method of Regional Frequency Analysis (RFA) is proposed to predict the occurrence probabilities of these extrema. The RFA intends to extend the dataset by pooling the data of neighboring locations and establishes the regional growth curve of a so-called “homogenous region”. An important aspect is the formation of the homogeneous regions because only for those regions data can be pooled. Statistical methods will also be presented to derive homogeneous clusters. Applications include the prediction of extreme river discharges in Northwest and Central Europe and extreme waves along the Dutch North Sea coasts.

50|$|The {{hydraulic}} fluid change in 1967 was another brain teaser for U.S. automotive regulators at the Department of Transportation. NHTSA follows the precautionary principle, also {{used by the}} Food and Drug Administration, where new innovations are prohibited until their developers can prove them to the regulators; this stifles the experimentation that automakers need to advance their products. NHTSA had already approved a brake fluid they considered safe - DOT 3 brake fluid, which is red and hygroscopic to promote internal rust. This completely different fluid, used in aircraft applications - the technically superior green LHM (Liquide <b>Hydraulique</b> Mineral) - took NHTSA two years to analyze for automotive use. Approval finally came in January 1969, so half the U.S. cars of the 1969 model year use red fluid and half use green fluid.|$|R

Bélidor enlisted in the army at a young age. After leaving the army, he developed an interest in science and engineering, and became professor of artillery at the school of Fère-en-Tardenois in Aisne. For a while he worked on measuring the arc of the earth. In the years to come he published several works of great importance, {{on a wide range of}} subjects, including hydraulics, mathematics, and civil and military engineering. His most famous book is L'architecture <b>hydraulique</b> (published in four volumes from 1737-1753). Here, integral calculus is used for the first time in solving technical problems.|$|R
