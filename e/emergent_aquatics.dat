P. Production levels then declined. Very low lcvcls of aquatic production (indicated by 1 ow pigment concentrations) seem jndicated by about 6, 000 B. P., in the middle part of a warm, dry interval following which pigment concentrations remained low (cxccpt for a brief interval about 5, 000 B-P.), but with a mnrkcd rise in the ratio of chlorophyll derivatives to carotenoids, indicating an increase in allochthonous organic input accompanying the return of cooler moister conditions. These resulted in an encroachment of oak forest on the prairie, followed by the succession to reed-swamp on the lake. A return to more truly aquatic conditions was reflected {{by an increase in}} scdimcntary pigments from about 3, 000 B. P. to a peak at 1, 700 B. P., accompanied by a decline in the ratio of chlorophyll derivatives to carotenoids. Subsequently pigment concentrations fell, and their ratio incrcascd sharply, as <b>emergent</b> <b>aquatics</b> became well established and caused a rapid evolution of pond to grass-sedge meadow. The pigment data are gcncrally in harmony with the ecological conclusions from pollen and macrofossils, but they provide much more information on changes in aquatic pro-ductivity at the site.

40|$|In recent years, {{the impact}} of aquatic {{invasive}} species on biodiversity {{has become a major}} global concern. In the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region in the Central Valley of California, USA, dense infestations of the invasive <b>aquatic</b> <b>emergent</b> weed, water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) interfere with ecosystem functioning. This silent invader constantly encroaches into waterways, eventually making them unusable by people and uninhabitable to aquatic fauna. Quantifying and mapping invasive plant species in aquatic ecosystems is important for efficient management and implementation of mitigation measures. This paper evaluates the ability of hyperspectral imagery, acquired using the HyMap sensor, for mapping water hyacinth in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region. Classification was performed on sixty-four flightlines acquired over the study site using a decision tree which incorporated Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm, absorption feature parameters in the spectral region between 0. 4 and 2. 5 μm, and spectral endmembers. The total image dataset was 130 GB.

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{technical}} note describes an ecological modeling approach {{that can be}} used to explore relationships between species of <b>emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> vegetation communities and their environmental conditions. The modeling approach was used to evaluate the potential persistence of two desired — and quantitatively important — rhizomatous plant species under various climatological conditions: Sagittaria latifolia, common in freshwater systems, can produce tubers as well as rhizomes; Spartina alterniflora is typical for coastal marshes. Both species are endemic to the United States. BACKGROUND: <b>Emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> vegetation may play important roles in aquatic ecosystems. Functions attributed to “desirable ” species are: stabilization of sediment and shores, amelioration of water transparency, regulation of nutrient availability in the water column and service as a habitat and food source for invertebrates, fish and waterfowl. Conversely, effects attributed to “nuisance ” or “invasive ” species are: excessive biomass production that interferes with human utilization of water resources, or displacement of desirable indigenous communities. Distribution and abundance of emergent vegetation in large water bodies in the Mississippi River System (UMRS) and Coastal Louisiana (CL) have changed for decades and declined in recent years.

40|$|Summary <b>Emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> insects can {{represent}} an important subsidy to terrestrial ecosystems {{but may also}} transport accumulated contaminants across ecosystem boundaries when larvae develop in contaminated sediments. We sampled tetragnathid spiders (terrestrial predators), larval chironomids (spider prey of aquatic origin) and terrestrial insects (terrestrial prey) from two contaminated and two control sites in the Norfolk Broads (U. K.) {{to determine whether the}} organotin compound tributyltin (TBT) is transferred by <b>emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> insects. TBT, a biocide in antifoulant paints, was prohibited in the U. K. in 1987 and globally since 2008 but persists in sediments for decades. Combining stable-isotope analyses commonly used in ecology with ecotoxicological methods enabled us to test whether aquatic subsidies could transport organotin to terrestrial predators. Stable-isotope mixing models (δ 15 N and δ 13 C) indicated that chironomids contributed 31 – 98 % to spider biomass. Subsequent organotin analyses revealed consistent, low-level butyltin (dibutyltin; DBT) contamination of chironomids from the most contaminated site but not from the other three sites. Spiders from the most contaminated site had DBT concentrations similar to those of their chironomid prey. To assess bioaccumulation, we used δ 15 N values as a proxy for trophic position of sediments, chironomids and spiders, and correlated these values with the respective DBT concentrations. Notwithstanding indications of 15 N-enrichment along this short food chain, chironomid DBT concentrations were significantly greater than those of their spider predators. Biota sediment accumulation factors (sediments to chironomids) and biomagnification factors (chironomids to spiders) were below the thresholds defining the occurrence of bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Although biomagnification was not detected, it is of concern that butyltins are still present in freshwater food webs c. 25 years since last known TBT use in the U. K., and continue to be transferred to terrestrial consumers...|$|R

In order to characterize this particular ecological niche, which is out of reach for a direct investigation, environmental factors likely to influence the interaction between larvae and host plant roots were investigated using a simplified laboratory microcosm. Environmental light and oxygen concentrations appeared to be the main factors influencing larval attachment, a dark anoxic environment being significantly more favourable. Carbon dioxide produced by the root system of the host plant appeared to be an attractive cue for larval attachment. Knowledge of the hierarchy of these environmental factors may enable us to better understand the ecological traits of larval C. richiardii in deep water. With regard to their management, new ecological data are required to develop a long-term control strategy against Coquillettidia mosquitoes...|$|R
