He felt guilty that his weather-related problem caused Mootz to crash his car, so he would cause it to rain for Mootz.

5|$|Both Murphy and Universal gave serious {{considerations}} to {{a follow-up}} {{version of his}} post-war life. Murphy rejected the Richard J.

Desi Arnaz offered to bankroll a 1965 project titled Helmets in the Dust. At Murphy's request McClure wrote a film treatment, but the project never came to fruition.|$|E

60|$|Thereafter, {{life on the}} Lonely Island flowed as <b>happily</b> as <b>ever</b> {{for many}} years, with the {{exception}} of a brief but dark interval, when a scoundrel, named Joshua Hill, went to the island, passed himself off as an agent of the British Government, misled the trusting inhabitants, and established a reign of terror, ill-treating Nobbs, Buffett, and Evans, whom for a time he compelled to quit the place.

5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live <b>happily</b> <b>ever</b> after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E

5000|$|... "Never" [...] Evers - [...] "Never" [...] Evers is aptly nicknamed, {{since he}} never turns down any {{assignment}} {{regardless of how}} risky it may be. When other Ring Raiders don't want a mission because it's too dangerous, they call Evers. He's the ultimate showboat: cocky, and with little respect for authority...even Victor Vector's. Evers {{has been known to}} disobey a direct order when he thought his superiors were [...] "being too cautious". This daredevil never flies anywhere without loud rock n’ roll blasting away in his cockpit. <b>Happily,</b> <b>Evers</b> is almost as good as he rates himself, which is very good indeed. Despite his penchant for bending procedures, and even breaking safety rules, this fighter jockey is definitely someone you want on your side; just ask anybody who's ever flown against him and survived to tell the tale, if you can find them. He would be a better Ring Raider if he were less hot headed and more reliable, but then he wouldn't be [...] "Never" [...] Evers. He pilots the Fearless Falcon, a customized F-16 fighter equipped with a special fuel-nozzle that allows it to train un-ignited fuel in the face of pursuing Skull Squadron planes. When Evers' afterburner is kicked in, the pursuer finds himself in a hot spot, and the Fearless Falcon finds itself miles away, almost instantly. Evers did not appear in the cartoon or the toy line.|$|R

60|$|The town is in a foam with politics. The {{report is}} that the Lords will throw out the Bill, and now, morning of 8th October, I learn it is quoited downstairs like a shovel-board shilling, with a plague to it, as the most uncalled-for attack upon a free constitution, under which men lived <b>happily,</b> which <b>ever</b> was ventured in my day.

Well, I will have time enough to think of all this.|$|R
60|$|And {{who were}} Halcyone and Ceyx? You shall hear while the chest floats on. Halcyone was a fairy maiden, the {{daughter}} of the beach and of the wind.

And Halcyone saw him drowning, and leapt into the sea to him; but in vain. Then the Immortals took pity on them both, and changed them into two fair sea-birds; and now they build a floating nest every year, and sail up and down <b>happily</b> for <b>ever</b> upon the pleasant seas of Greece.|$|R

I write to her weekly, and get answers; everything passing between us as cheerfully, and apparently, as <b>happily</b> as <b>ever.</b> No, do not blame Lucy; who, I am certain, would quit everything and everybody to come to me, had she the smallest notion of the truth. On the contrary, I believe she thinks I would rather not have her at Clawbonny, just at this moment, much as she knows I love her; for, one of Lucy's observation and opportunities cannot but suspect the truth. Let me lie on your breast, brother; it wearies me to talk so much." ...|$|R

60|$|The child sat down, in this old, silent place, {{among the}} stark {{figures on the}} tombs--they made it more quiet there, than elsewhere, to her fancy--and gazing round {{with a feeling of}} awe, {{tempered}} with a calm delight, felt that now she was happy, and at rest. She took a Bible from the shelf, and read; then, laying it down, thought of the summer days and the bright springtime that would come--of the rays of sun that would fall in aslant, upon the sleeping forms--of the leaves that would flutter at the window, and play in glistening shadows on the pavement--of the songs of birds, and growth of buds and blossoms out of doors--of the sweet air, that would steal in, and gently wave the tattered banners overhead. What if the spot awakened thoughts of death! Die who would, it would still remain the same; these sights and sounds would still go on, as <b>happily</b> as <b>ever.</b> It would be no pain to sleep amidst them.|$|R

He ought to be much comforted by the reflection that she was quit of it forever; that she was, or would soon be, married (vague rumours of her father's projects in that direction had reached Bleeding Heart Yard, with the news of her sister's marriage); and that the Marshalsea gate had shut for ever on all those perplexed possibilities of a time that was gone.|$|R
