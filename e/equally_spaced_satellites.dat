40|$|Phase-change {{materials}} (PCMs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} promising candidates for emerging storage class memory (SCM) technology. SCMs aim at bridging the cost-performance gap between nowadays established memory solutions (fast, but volatile, e. g. DRAM) and data storage technologies (slow, but non-volatile, e. g. FLASH). The application potential of PCMs rests on a high endurance, high bit density (multi-level cell capability) and programming times of the order of nanoseconds. In conventional PCM technology, the binary information is encoded by two different solid states: a crystalline (SET state) and an amorphous phase (RESET state) which differ by orders of magnitude in their electrical resistance. The phase transition is induced thermally allowing for crystallization (SET operation) or melt-quenching (RESET operation) and thereby amorphization. Only recently, superior switching properties have been reported for device-integrated GeTe/Sb 2 Te 3 superlattice (SL) PCMs that outperform GeTe-Sb 2 Te 3 alloys in terms of programming time, power consumption and endurance. In difference to conventional PCM technology, the contrast between SET and RESET is argued to stem from two crystalline states that differ in their local atomic arrangement at the GeTe/Sb 2 Te 3 interface. The switching between these two atomic configurations is argued to be electric-field-driven, rather than thermally induced as in conventional PCMs. This novel switching mechanism has been ascribed for the improved device performance. At present, the superior switching behavior is confirmed in numerous publications, yet the underlying switching mechanism is under strong debate. This thesis provides insights into the structure, growth, thermal stability and thermal conductivity of GeTe/Sb 2 Te 3 superlattices (chalcogenide superlattice: CSL). Highly textured CSLs were grown by direct-current magnetron sputter deposition. Their structural quality is mirrored in prominent SL X-ray diffraction features such as SL Bragg peaks and <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> <b>satellites.</b> CSLs have been prepared with bilayer thicknesses Λ as small as Λ= 34 Å. Yet, intermixing was observed at such small values of Λ giving rise to local GeTe-Sb 2 Te 3 alloying at the interface. This tendency for intermixing was also found in case of post-deposition annealing of the CSLs. The SL stacking is unaffected by any thermal treatment at temperatures up to 300 °C. At higher temperatures, the artificial stacking dissolves into a stable GeTe-Sb 2 Te 3 compound. At the beginning of this thesis, no data on the thermal conductivity κ was available for GeTe/Sb 2 Te 3 SL. Yet, κ is a parameter that crucially determines the device performance in conventional PCM technology. Therefore, the thermal conductivity of CSLs with different values of Λ was measured. It was found that κ is significantly reduced compared to GeTe and Sb 2 Te 3, respectively. Moreover, κ develops a minimum in dependence of Λ which approaches values of amorphous PCMs. Such a minimum is a fingerprint of SL structures with high interface quality. The present switching models consider neither the local intermixing at the GeTe/Sb 2 Te 3 interface, nor the strikingly small thermal conductivity κ of CSLs. This thesis hence provides valuable results that may help to unravel the cause for the improved device performance of CSLs...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{behavior of}} N coorbital satellites {{moving with the}} same average mean motion around a primary has been studied both analytically and by numerical integrations for N from 2 to 9 satellites. Simplified dynamical equations are {{used to determine the}} different stationary configurations and their local stability against infinitesimal perturbations. The ring of <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> identical <b>satellites</b> is found to be locally unstable for N of six or less, while for N from two to eight there exists another stable compact stationary configuration with separations of 60 deg or less between adjacent satellites. For N of seven or more the <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> configuration becomes locally stable, and for N of nine or more it is the only stationary configuration. The motion becomes chaotic for large-amplitude perturbations. The chaotic motion fills a restricted region of phase space whose outer boundary is determined by the maximum velocity curve...|$|R
40|$|Because {{atmospheric}} attenuation is greater for EHF frequencies than lower frequencies, {{it is necessary}} to design EHF satellite constellations so that the minimum elevation angles of the ground station antennas are larger than for satellite communication links using lower frequencies. The need for larger elevation angles reduces the coverage provided by geosynchronous equatorial satellites. This paper examines how the size of the polar regions not receiving adequate EHF coverage varies with the number of <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> equatorial <b>satellites.</b> The suitabilities of 24 hour Tundra, 12 hour Molniya, and six hour circular orbits for providing the missing coverage are then examined. The geographical location requirements for ground stations which link these satellites into global communication networks are analyzed. Three standard small satellite launch vehicles (SSLVs) can launch either three 12 hour Molniya satellites or six circular orbit satellites. While three Molniya satellites complete coverage of the northern hemisphere, six circular orbit satellites complete coverage of the entire globe. Finally, ground station location is shown to be critical for networking Molniya constellations, while circular orbit constellations offer the use of existing defense communication system architecture EHF terminals...|$|R

40|$|The Iridium® System {{satellite}} constellation consists of 66 satellites in circular, polar, 780 km altitude orbits in six <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> planes. Each <b>satellite</b> carries an engineering magnetometer which has sufficient resolution {{to sense the}} Birkeland currents. This paper presents a spherical harmonic fitting (SHF) technique for estimating field aligned currents (FACs) using the cross track component of the magnetic field measurements from the Iridium satellites. The SHF magnetic field perturbations along with Ampere’s law are used to derive the global FACs from 40 ° MLAT to the pole in either hemisphere. Data for 10 – 11 UT, 23 August, 1999 were obtained from Iridium, Defense Meteorology Satellite Program (DMSP) F 13 and the Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) onboard the POLAR satellite. The SHF data were evaluated along the DMSP F 13 track. The range of east-west component, SHF magnetic perturbations from Iridium was (− 530, 465) nT compared with (− 630, 634) nT from DMSP F 13. The derived upward FACs ranged from − 0. 8 to 0. 9 μAm⁻². Upward FACs were co-located with bright dayside UVI emissions...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the area and}} entropy spectra of black holes in topologically massive gravity with gravitational Chern-Simons term. The examples we consider are the BTZ black hole and the warped AdS black hole. For the non-rotating BTZ black hole, the area and entropy spectra are <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> and independent of the coupling constant of the Chern-Simons term. For the rotating BTZ black hole case, the spectra of {{the inner and outer}} horizon areas are not <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> in general and dependent of the coupling constant. However the entropy spectrum is <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> and independent of the coupling constant. For the warped AdS black holes for >̌ 1 by using the quasinormal modes obtained without imposing the boundary condition at radial infinity we find again that the entropy spectrum is <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> and independent of the coupling constant, while the spectra of the inner and outer horizon areas are not <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> and dependent of the coupling constant. Our result implies that the entropy spectrum has a universal behavior regardless of the presence of the gravitational Chern-Simons term, and therefore it implies that the entropy is more `fundamental' than the horizon area.
