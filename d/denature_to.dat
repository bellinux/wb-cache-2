Due to a decreasing availability of cytochrome b5, necessary for reduction of met-Hb, the transition of HbO2 into met-Hb will, in contrast to inside the body, no longer be reversed.

50|$|The use of {{temperatures}} {{much lower}} than for conventional cooking is an equally essential feature of sous-vide, resulting in much higher succulence: at these lower temperatures, cell walls in the food do not burst. In the case of meat cooking, tough collagen in connective tissue can be hydrolysed into gelatin, without heating the meat’s proteins high enough that they <b>denature</b> <b>to</b> a degree that the texture toughens and moisture is wrung out of the meat. In contrast, with the cooking of vegetables, where extreme tenderness or softness is seen as undesirably overcooked, {{the ability of the}} sous-vide technique to cook vegetables at a temperature below the boiling point of water allows vegetables to be thoroughly cooked (and pasteurized, if necessary) while maintaining a firm or somewhat crisp texture. While the cell walls will generally not burst, the de-polymerization of the pectic polysaccharides that connect the vegetable cells together and/or the gelatinisation of starch in the vegetable can be achieved without overcooking.|$|E

40|$|Microbial {{attachment}} to contact lenses is utilized {{in this study}} as a model to examine microbial/substrate interactions. These interactions commonly occur on a biofilm, containing microbes and exopolymeric secretions (EPS). EPS commonly contains sugars for attachment. Silica hydrogel contact lenses were studied with relation to microbial attachment. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) and Fourier Transform Infared Spectrometry (FTIR) were utilized to examine this mechanism. A novel method was developed to prepare lenses and attached microbial communities for SEM imaging. A common marine fixative was utilized with extended fixation times which resulted in fixation osmolarities that preserved the delicate lens polymers {{as well as the}} attached microbial communities. In addition, a 24 hemisphere shaped well assaylike tray was developed that aided in lens shape retention during dehydration. SEM analysis of P. aeruginosa EPS yielded information on its 3 -dimentional morphology on the attached lens. TEM analysis using gold nanoparticles confirmed that active sites on EPS secreted for attachment were comprised mainly of highly supported structures {{on the periphery of the}} EPS, with strut like supports crossing the surface. FTIR analysis of the EPS revealed chemical signatures related to the nature of its bonds as spectral peaks. When heated to 34 °C and then cooled to 20 °C the EPS did not return to its original chemistry. Compared to some polymers, which retain “memory” and return to original chemistry and shape, the bacteria EPS appeared to <b>denature</b> <b>to</b> the point that major components of its molecular structure went into solution. These results have possible implication to the in vivo behavior of bacteria. Assessment of several Acanthamoeba species attachment success found that cysts were in generally more successful in attachment compared to trophozoite stages. Results indicate that in all species and experimental conditions, cyst forms of Acanthamoeba sps. were more successful at attachment then the trophozoite forms. Furthermore, there was a suggested differential pattern in attachment if pathogen and non-pathogen species are compared. The results suggest that in pathogen forms (between 1 / 2 and 12 hours after inoculation) attachment was greatest at 8 hours compared with non-pathogen species, which had lower success attachment at 8 hr, and higher relative success attachment at ½ and 12 hours. It was also found that one species in which pathogeniety is not known (FL 32) was intermediate in attachment success. These findings warrant further study of pathogen Acanthamoeba sps. in terms of attachment success...|$|E

40|$|Common {{formulation}} batters {{were prepared}} by pork meat comminution and processed for 30 min by pressure/thermal combinations of 200 and 400 MPa with five temperatures from 10 to 70 °C. Processing performance was monitored by determination of pH, cooking loss, and three textural parameters {{to assess the}} quality of pressurized versus unpressurized samples. Protein thermal denaturation was determined by differential scanning calorimetry to evaluate the unfolding effects of processing. Net effects were pressure-temperature interdependent, pressure denaturation being particularly effective at nondenaturing temperatures. Pressure suppressed subsequent thermal denaturation at unfolding temperatures, preventing batter proteins from <b>denaturing</b> <b>to</b> an extent dependent on the magnitude of both pressure and temperature processing parameters. Pressurized batters needed higher temperatures to overcome pressure effects and regain total protein thermal denaturation. Pressure/thermal treatments impaired meat gelling at normal cooking temperatures, leading to undesirable effects on the pressurized batters.

40|$|Many {{rare and}} {{valuable}} ancient specimens now carry {{the scars of}} ancient DNA research, as questions of population genetics and phylogeography require larger sample sets. This fuels the demand for reliable techniques to screen for DNA preservation prior to destructive sampling. Only one such technique has been widely adopted: the extent of aspartic acid racemization (AAR). The kinetics of AAR {{are believed to be}} similar to the rate of DNA depurination and therefore a good measure of the likelihood of DNA survival. Moreover, AAR analysis is only minimally destructive. We report the first comprehensive test of AAR using 91 bone and teeth samples from temperate and high-latitude sites that were analysed for DNA. While the AAR range of all specimens was low (0. 02 – 0. 17), no correlation was found between the extent of AAR and DNA amplification success. Additional heating experiments and surveys of the literature indicated that d/l Asx is low in bones until almost all the collagen is lost. This is because aspartic acid is retained in the bone within the constrained environment of the collagen triple helix, where it cannot racemize for steric reasons. Only if the helix <b>denatures</b> <b>to</b> soluble gelatin can Asx racemize readily, but this soluble gelatine is readily lost in most burial environments. We conclude that Asx d/l is not a useful screening technique for ancient DNA from bone...|$|R

50|$|Protein {{distribution}} in egg whites is as follows: (54%) ovalbumin, (13%) conalbumin/ ovotransferrin, (11%) ovomucoid, (4%) ovoglobulins, (3.5%) lysozyme, and (2%) ovomucin. Ovoglobulins drive foaming, ovomucin {{is the main}} stabilization agent, and {{the remainder of the}} proteins interact to contribute to overall foaming and stability. When egg whites are beaten, some of the hydrogen bonds in the proteins break, causing the proteins to unfold ("denature") and to aggregate non-specifically. When these egg white proteins <b>denature</b> (due <b>to</b> agitation from beating), their hydrophobic regions are exposed and the formation of intermolecular protein-protein interactions is promoted. These protein-protein interactions, usually disulfide bridges, create networks responsible for the structure of the foam and this change in structure leads to the stiff consistency required for meringues. The use of a copper bowl, or the addition of cream of tartar is required <b>to</b> additionally <b>denature</b> the proteins <b>to</b> create the firm peaks, otherwise the whites will not be firm.
