40|$|Recently Einstein’s {{invariance}} of {{the phase}} of a plane wave (1905) {{has been described as}} ”questionable” [Y-S Huang 2007]. Another definition of this phase, taking into account a ”relativistically induced optical anisotropy ” for isotropic medium in moving, has been proposed [A. Gjurchinovski 2007]. We suggest (logically) to determine this ”relativistically induced effect ” if the isotropic medium is the vacuum. We prove that the basic Lorentz invariant, in vacuum, is not {{the phase of}} a plane wave (ωt−˜k. ˜r) but the phase of a spherical wave (ωt − kr). According to Poincaré, an <b>isotropic</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> is not LTed (Lorentz transformed) into an <b>isotropic</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> (Einstein 1905) but LTed into an anisotropic ellipsoïdal wave (c = 1, relativity of simultaneity). Poincaré’s ellipsoidal wavefront (1906) is an equiphase surface. Our approach consists in deleting (˜ k. ˜r → kr) and not adding (ω → ˜ k. ũ) a scalar product [A. Gjurchinovski 2007]. The Lorenz gauge is connected with the invariance of the phase of a spherical wave and the transverse gauge with Einstein’s invariant. From Poincaré’s invariant we deduce a Doppler formula that {{is not the same as}} Einstein’s one. We call this formula ”Poincaré’s formula ” because it is unseparable of Poincaré’s theory of expansion of space and therefore the measurements of Hubble. 1 Invariance of the phase of a plane wave, transverse gauge an...|$|E

40|$|Sum {{rules and}} {{physical}} limitations within electromagnetic theory and antenna theory have received significant {{attention in the}} last few years. However, the derivations are often relying on application specific and sometimes unsupported assumptions, and therefore a mathematically rigorous and generally applicable approach seems timely. Such an approach is presented in this thesis, along with examples and all the necessary proofs. The approach is also applied in the thesis to derive sum rules and physical limitations on electromagnetic <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> scattering. This has not been done before, despite the widespread use of <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> decompositions. For example, <b>spherical</b> <b>waves</b> and the antenna scattering matrix provide a complete and compact description of all the important properties of an antenna, are crucial parts in spherical near-field antenna measurements, and have been used recently to model antenna-channel interaction and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. This thesis is also the first to present a method to estimate <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> coefficients from propagation channel measurements. The results of this thesis can roughly be divided into three categories: Firstly, a general approach to derive sum rules and physical limitations on input-output systems based on the assumptions of causality and passivity is presented (Paper I). Secondly, sum rules and physical limitations on the scattering and matching of electromagnetic <b>spherical</b> <b>waves</b> are derived, and the implications for antennas are explored (Papers II-IV). Thirdly, a method to estimate <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> coefficients from channel measurements, and the results of a measurement campaign, are presented and analysed (Paper V).
