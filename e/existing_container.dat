40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the reasons for moisture ingress in ready to drink mixes. The containers for this product were supposed to be moisture resistant. However, after a certain period it was observed that the product inside was prone to caking and lump formation due to moisture ingress. The dimensions of the containers were compared with the actual dimensions and the containers were exposed to accelerated aging to simulate a longer duration of shelf life. Several recommendations were made for new design of containers which were also tested for moisture ingress. Some observations were also made at the packaging line. The results indicated that the <b>existing</b> <b>containers</b> were defective and the recommended containers supported all the hypotheses.

40|$|Introduction : Containers for {{the storage}} of {{platelets}} are made using polyvinyl chloride plasticised with di, (2 -ethyl hexyl) phthalate, n-butyryl, tri (n-hexyl) citrate and tri (2 -ethyl hexyl) mellitate or using special poly olefins without plasticiser. Of these, the first two have disadvantages such as plasticiser leaching and impairment of platelet function. Polyolefin bags cannot be HF welded or steam sterilized. Mellitate plasticised bags can store platelets well for five days {{but they are not}} completely phthalate free. Research and Development: We have developed a new generation of containers made of PVC plasticised with the non DEHP, non aromatic plasticiser, 1, 2 - Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, diisononyl ester (Hexamoll DINCH) which can store platelets without loss of function for at least six days. Observation: The present studies show that DINCH plasticised PVC bags (TPL- 167) are well suited for {{the storage of}} platelet concentrates for more than five days. Conclusion: The present studies show that the PVC plasticised with the non phthalate, non aromatic, non toxic plasticiser DINCH is a viable alternative to other <b>existing</b> <b>containers</b> for the storage of platelets for more than five days...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} data envelopment analysis for analysing {{the performance of a}} number of spanish municipalities in terms of the amount of glass recycled. The inputs considered are the number of glass containers assigned to each municipality on one hand and the population and the number of bars and restaurants in town on the other. The number of containers is the only discretionary input; the other two are considered non-controllable. In order to establish for each municipality a target to aim at, an aggregated-output orientation is used. That is, instead of projecting each municipality independently, a centralised approach is used. Thus, the model does not require that each municipality keeps at least the same number of containers but only that the total number of <b>existing</b> <b>containers</b> not be exceeded. The goal of the regional authority is to assign the available containers so as to maximise the total amount of glass recycled by all the municipalities. The fact that the number of containers is an integer variable has been taken into account. Numerical results are shown. Recycling operations Resource allocation Data envelopment analysis...|$|R

The Kieldrecht Lock, a new lock {{at the end of the}} Deurganckdock, giving access to the docks in the port area on the left bank opened in June 2016 and is the largest dock in the world. The lock is deeper than the Berendrecht Lock, the previous largest, in response to the trend towards ever-larger ships. The lock, which represents an investment of 340 million euros, is the second lock into the enclosed harbours and represents a failsafe feature; had the sole lock failed, any vessels inside would have been trapped, whereas it is highly improbable that both locks might simultaneously fail. On the landward side, facing the dock complex, the lock leads into the Waasland canal. From there the ships have easy access to all the other docks on the left bank: the Doel dock, the Verrebroek dock, the Vrasene dock and the North and South mooring docks.|$|E

This thesis analyses the advantageousness of introducing a load unit with a new size. There are three reasons why the current choice of containers is not sufficient. Firstly, {{there is a certain}} range of assembly parts that does not fit very well into the existing standard load units. Secondly, the average measurements of the parts have grown in the last years and thirdly, several of the <b>existing</b> <b>containers</b> leave unused space in the transportation vehicles. For this the relevant costs and other, more qualitative aspects like the placing at the assembly line are considered. A container size is identified that offers a significant savings potential. For this potential the handling and transportation costs are identified as the relevant leverages. These costs are found to depend mainly on the utilisation degree of the load units. To calculate the different utilisation degrees, a packing-algorithm in form of a four-block heuristic is applied and its results are extrapolated on the basis of existing BMW packing information. Thus, several assembly parts are identified that fit better into the suggested load unit than in the existing ones. These results are assessed using BMW’s expense ratios for handling and transportation. 80 parts are determined for which the migration to the new size would result in savings of more than 5, 000 EUR for each per year in Dingolfing. Together, these parts offer a savings potential of about 0. 9 million Euro...|$|R

In this paper, we aim at providing a quality model for making explicit the quality features (those concerning functionality, suitability, etc.) that determine the form that such a library might take. Quality features are arranged hierarchically according to the ISO/IEC quality standard. We tailor this standard to the specific context of container libraries, by identifying their observable attributes and establishing some tradeoffs among them. Afterwards, we apply the resulting model {{to a pair of}} <b>existing</b> <b>container</b> libraries. As main contribution of our proposal, we may say that the resulting quality model provides a structured framework for (1) discussing and evaluating the capabilities that the prospective Ada Standard Container Library might offer, and (2) analyzing the consequences of the decisions taken during its design. ...|$|E
