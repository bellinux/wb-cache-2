5|$|The 2-acre (1 ha) walled <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> {{was built}} in the early 1700s to provide fruit and {{vegetables}} for the estate. The Victorian head gardener's cottage is built into the southern wall. Alongside the west wall is a private path, known as the Colonel's Walk, used by the family to bypass the <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> on their way to church. There are traces of original chimneys built into the wall supporting espaliered fruit trees, located there in order to maintain an optimum temperature for year-round growth. One of these chimneys has been restored. The garden is still in use today and includes traditional and exotic varieties , and fruit bushes, some of which are used to make jams and chutneys for sale in the hall's tearooms.|$|E

5000|$|To {{the west}} of the terraces, {{woodland}} separated the grounds of the hall from a gardener's cottage and <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens.</b> The <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> were constructed in the early 1840s, and provided vegetables, fruit and flowers to the Hall. By the end of the 19th century [...] the 10-acre <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> gained an outer wall, {{making it one of the}} largest walled gardens in the UK. The wall featured flues to heat the gardens to avoid frost, using a Trentham design. The <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> also featured potting sheds, and glasshouses containing cucumber plants, melons, grape vines and peach trees.|$|R
50|$|Through the 1800s much of Long Branch’s {{land was}} {{taken up by the}} wheat plantation. The main house was {{supported}} by a greenhouse (burned down in 1861), orchards, and <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens.</b> Records show that roses, chrysanthemums, and violets were grown on the property. The orchard had cherries, plums, and peaches. The <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> grew a variety of vegetables and herbs. By the 1930s the gardens were lost, however, the Hewitts reintroduced the flower and <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> to Long Branch.|$|R
5|$|To the south, is the Croquet lawn, {{previously}} {{a tennis}} court – Lady Churchill was an accomplished and competitive player of both, although Churchill was not. Beyond the lawn {{are a number of}} structures grouped around the Victorian <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden,</b> many of which Churchill was involved in building. He had developed an interest in bricklaying when he bought Chartwell and throughout the 1920s and 1930s constructed walls, a summerhouse and a number of houses on the estate. In 1928 he joined the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, a move which caused some controversy. Near the <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> are the Golden Rose walk, a Golden Wedding anniversary present to the Churchills from their children in 1958, and Churchill's painting studio, constructed in the 1930s, which now houses a large collection of his artistic works.|$|E
5|$|The castle is {{approached}} {{through the}} castle meadow, {{an area of}} open parkland, lined with Holm oaks planted in the 1860s, and is surrounded by the dry moat, now a garden dating from at least the 1850s and planted with trees and shrubs. Adjacent to the castle are the Queen Mother's Garden and the <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> and glasshouses. The Queen Mother's Garden was built by English Heritage as a 95th birthday gift for the then Lord Warden in 1997, the site having been originally part of the wider kitchen gardens, before being turned into a tennis court in the 1920s. Designed by Penelope Hobhouse, the garden incorporates classical and Islamic themes, with a 92-foot-long (28 m) pool, a viewing mound and a classical pavilion. The two glasshouses have been restored, functioning as cold greenhouses, while {{the remainder of the}} <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> is planted with a mixture of vegetables, fruit trees and flowers.|$|E

The present study was conducted with the objective to study the constraints in adoption of <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardening</b> techniques under Mokokchung district of Nagaland. Accordingly 25 families from the four villages of the district who were already practicing <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardening</b> were selected for the study. The constraints as perceived by the respondents were scored on the basis of magnitude of the problems. Constraints were related to inputs, socio-culture, post-harvest technology etc. The general constraints were the most serious constraints followed by input, socio-cultural, post-harvest and technical constraints in adoption of <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardening.</b> While analyzing overall constraints as perceived by the farmers the study highlighted that unavailability of quality planting material of fruits and seeds of HYVs of vegetables, lesser availability of bio-pesticides and bio-fertilizers, lack of knowledge about seed treatment, lack of knowledge regarding major pests and diseases identification and their management, continuous adoption of traditional practices for growing vegetables, lack of interest among rural youth, difficulty in selling small amount of surplus of produce, lack of knowledge regarding preservation and processing of surplus produce, frequent inundation of <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> during rainy season due to high water table, acidic soil and high EC were reported major bottlenecks in successful adoption of <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardening...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{sustainable}} city must incorporate the environmental dimension {{in the development}} of the dense and complex urban area. To reach that, the urban agriculture and the green spaces with multiple uses, such as urban <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens,</b> must be incorporated in the cities sustainable development model. In Portugal, Braga is a good example of those cities where the preservation of rurality tradition is important in the urban development, for the city presents an eminent agricultural involving landscape that coexists with the urban centre activities. Nowadays, city centre <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> represent the remaining portions of the agricultural life once intensely lived. However, Braga also presents typical environmental problems of large cities, such as the significant increase of mobility and road traffic, which puts the viability of the urban <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> health at risk. The present work describes the methodology used in a monitoring process in order to analyse the environmental condition of Braga urban <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens.</b> Soil and lettuce samples from eight different sites had been analysed taking into account their chemical composition. The analysis results show viable problems for the urban <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> as agricultural spaces that produce food with an appropriate quality for a nutritious diet. The results reveal preoccupying levels of contamination and pollution of heavy metals such as Cadmium, Lead and Zinc...|$|R
5|$|In 1809, the {{industrialist}} Sir Joseph Bailey leased the castle, {{going on}} to purchase it outright in 1844, and established a walled <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> known as Castle Gardens to the south-west of the main castle. It {{was used as a}} vicarage from 1825 onwards, including by Archdeacon William Bevan. The terraced gardens were maintained during the 19th century, with various trees planted behind the castle in the 1860s and 1870s, and a stable block was built within the grounds.|$|E

5|$|Built in 1897, it {{is a rare}} {{surviving}} {{example of}} a late Victorian orangery in the Classical style, constructed from ashlar and red brick. It has a seven-bay east/west plan with central entrances and three bays north/south, topped by a fully glazed ironwork hipped-roof. An entablature with protruding horizontal geison sits above Ionic half-column supports and corner pilasters. The centre entrance bay on the west front towards the <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> breaks forward as a portico, with pairs of giant engaged columns and broken pediment with a small oculus. Between each pair of columns are large round-headed windows with Gibbs surrounds and keystones.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger {{was then}} made the Lord Warden in 1792. Pitt was badly {{in debt and}} King George III {{believed}} that the post, which came with a salary of £3,000 a year, would usefully supplement Pitt's income. Pitt made extensive use of the castle and by 1803 he used it as his main residence {{in an effort to}} reduce his living costs. Pitt's niece, Lady Hester Stanhope, joined him at Walmer between 1803 and 1806; together with Pitt, she carried out extensive work on the castle gardens, transforming them from a simple <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> into a set of landscaped ornamental enclosures; Stanhope enlisted the Dover militia to help with the landscaping and planting.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the estate}} had been managed as a coppiced woodland, giving Robinson the {{opportunity}} to plant drifts of scilla, cyclamen, and narcissus between the coppiced hazels and chestnuts. On the edges, and in the cleared spaces in the woods, Robinson established plantings of Japanese anemone, lily, acanthus, and pampas grass, along with shrubs such as fothergilla, stewartia, and nyssa. Closer to the house he had some flower beds; throughout he planted red valerian, which he allowed to spread naturally around paving and staircases. Robinson planted thousands of daffodils annually, including 100,000 narcissi planted along one of the lakes in 1897. Over the years he added hundreds of trees, some of them from American friends John Singer Sargent and Frederick Law Olmsted. Other features included an oval-shaped walled <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden,</b> a heather garden, and a water garden {{with one of the}} largest collections of water lilies in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Petersham Gate {{served the}} Russell School, {{replacing}} the more ornate gates to Petersham Lodge. A disused carriage gate further {{up the hill}} was probably a tradesman's entrance to the school or to the Lodge stables. Bishop's Gate in Chisholm Road, previously known as the Cattle Gate, was for use by livestock allowed to pasture in the nineteenth century. It was opened for public use in 1896. <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Garden</b> Gate, hidden behind Teck Plantation, is probably a nineteenth-century gate. It has never been open to the public. Cambrian Gate or Cambrian Road Gate was constructed during World War I {{for access to the}} newly built South Africa Military Hospital. When the hospital was demolished in 1925, the entrance was made permanent and public as a pedestrian gate.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{gardens and}} {{pleasure}} grounds are situated {{close to the}} house, with an area of informal pleasure grounds extending to the south-east. Two features are the Cedar Walk and the Lime Walk, both majestic avenues {{to the south of}} the house, as well as a plantation known as Blind Wood. There is a terrace {{in front of the house}} with urns and vases, overlooking an extensive lawned area. Other features include a Victorian fernery and a sunken garden. To the west of the house, there is a rose garden with a central circular lawn. The <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> lies to the south of the pleasure grounds and is now a commercial nursery. The house and gardens are open to the public and in 2012 received about 230,000 visitors.|$|E

5|$|Built of {{red brick}} with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, {{the house has}} a compact, {{rectangular}} plan and has two main floors, plus a basement and an attic floor lit by dormer windows. On the south façade, there are eight casement windows {{in the basement and}} nine sash windows on each of the ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered hipped roof has a central flat section, surrounded by a balustrade with a cupola rising from its centre. The dormer windows are in a central, balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with balustrade extending the full width of the building, and broad shallow steps leading down to the lawns. The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry and <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden.</b>|$|E
5|$|For the XI Corps, {{it was a}} sad {{reminder}} of their retreat at Chancellorsville in May. Under heavy pursuit by Hays and Avery, they clogged the streets of the town; no one in the corps had planned routes for this contingency. Hand-to-hand fighting broke out in various places. Parts of the corps conducted an organized fighting retreat, such as Coster's stand in the brickyard. The private citizens of Gettysburg panicked amidst the turmoil, and artillery shells bursting overhead and fleeing refugees added to the congestion. Some soldiers sought to avoid capture by hiding in basements and in fenced backyards. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig was one such person who climbed a fence and hid behind a woodpile in the <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> of the Garlach family {{for the rest of the}} three-day battle. The only advantage that the XI Corps soldiers had was that they were familiar with the route to Cemetery Hill, having passed through that way in the morning; many in the I Corps, including senior officers, did not know where the cemetery was.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century the {{writings}} of Humphrey Repton (1752–1818) were highly influential in {{the return of the}} formal garden near to the house. His sons were directly involved in the restructuring of the landscape at Valleyfield, Fife. Walter Scott's dislike of the sweeping away of the old formal gardens was also influential in creating an emphasis on preservation and restoration. His ideas were taken up by John Claudius Loudon (1783–1843), the most prolific gardening author of the century in Britain, and were highly influential throughout the world. By 1850 ambitious formal gardens had been recreated at Drummond Castle, Dunrobin and Drumlandrig. New plants from around the world, often discovered and sampled by Scots, such as the rhododendron and monkey puzzle tree, meant that Victorian and Edwardian gardens were characterised by an eclectic mix of the formal, picturesque and gardenesque. By {{the end of the century}} the ideas of William Robinson (1838–1935), Gertrude Jekyll (1843–1932) and the Edinburgh-based Frances Hope (d. 1880), arguing for informal flower-based gardens, had begun to dominate. They resulted in a revival of the seventeenth-century mixed flower and <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden,</b> as carried out at Kellie Castle, and Earlshall, Fife by Robert Lorimer.|$|E
