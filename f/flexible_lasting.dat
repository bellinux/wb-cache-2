However, most 2 -D material-integrated photonic devices demonstrated to date are fabricated by transferring a layer of 2 -D material on top of already fabricated photonic structures, which limits full utilization of their capability. Here we introduce a new photonic integration approach via direct deposition and fabrication of chalcogenide glass photonic devices on 2 -D materials. We have applied the new process to fabricate high-performance, broadband on-chip graphene-based optical polarizers with a high contrast ratio of 740 dB/cm leveraging the remarkable optical anisotropy of graphene, and thermo-optic switches with a record heating efficiency of 10 nm/mW using in-waveguide low-loss (20 dB/cm) graphene transparent electrodes. The low processing temperatures of chalcogenide glasses further enables monolithic integration on plastics and the first waveguide-integrated graphene photodetector on <b>flexible</b> substrates. <b>Last</b> but not least, we have also demonstrated monolithic integration of chalcogenide photonic components on several other 2 -D materials including WSe 2, WS 2, and MoTe 2.

The way they speak to their boss or their colleagues is likely to be different. Attracted with the fact, the writer tries to find the language style used by the co-workers, boss towards his employees and employees toward their boss as well as the reasons of using particular style of language when the coworkers are communicating one another. In this study the writer relies on some theories, namely: language function, language style, language variations, social factors and social dimensions; and the last is sentences and the elements of bahasa Indonesia. The nature of the study is a descriptive and qualitative study for it does not concern with any numbers instead of the descriptions of the co-workers conversations that lead them to vary their language. The data is taken from the coworkers that involved in the Pro-XL Zona X-tra Luas Program, which was held from April 9 until May 20, 2001. The instruments of the study are the writers herself, the tape recorder and cassettes and also questionnaire. The parameters of the study are the characteristics of each language style of Five Clocks such as frozen style, formal style, consultative style, casual style, intimate style; social dimensions and social factors. Then, the procedure of the data analysis is data reduction, data display and verification. The result of the study shows that there is no particular style of language in most of the conversations. Mostly, the participants do not use special kind of language when they are interacting one another. The choice of using one or two of styles of language depends on how close their relationship and the settings of the conversations not their social positions or status (boss or employee). The participants (The Managers, The Female Presenter and the Male Presenter) who have a very close and intimate relationship use an Intimate style of language when communicating among them.

Both market shares and budget shares have been used as dependent variables in econometric models which were partly motivated by microeconomic theory. However attempts of econometricians (and other statisticians) to treat share equations adequately led mostly to unsatis-factory approaches: Some researchers although admitting that shares satisfy a sum constraint simply repressed the fact that shares cannot be norgially dls-tributed.

As their clock frequencies have increased and rise times of signals have decreased, the signal integrity of interconnects in the packaging and printed circuit boards plays a more and more important role.

40|$|A {{trend towards}} softer regulation, {{especially}} {{in the form of}} negotiated environmental agreements, is observable in national and international environmental policies. Such agreements are controversial, because there are fears that government will relinquish its responsibility for environmental protection. This paper analyses recent experiences with voluntary agreements in Germany. Topical German examples that have prompted public debates include the takeback agreement for cars, the voluntary agreement made by a number of industries on a C 02 reduction by the year 2005 and the voluntary agreement made by the automobile industry on the development of energy-efficient cars. Proponents of voluntary agreements argue that this instrument provides incentives to the business sector for the development of efficient, innovative and environmentally-friendly solutions. Analysing the examples mentioned above, we conclude {{that it is hard to}} detect solutions derserving such attributes. These agreements are unlikely to produce results that go beyond what industry would have done in any case and they avoid using economic incentives. The agreements are' non-binding and unenforceable, with the negotiating process leading to a watering down of the environmental goals government had originally aimed at. A preference for negotiated solutions on principle, as currently espoused by the Federal Government in Germany, seems to be counterproductive. If the government clearly signals its willingness to refrain from using regulatory or economic instruments in favour of industry agreements, it weakens its negotiating position. The government also limits its options should the implementation of the agreement prove unsatisfactory. Government needs to be in control in order to leave its choice of policy instruments open and to be <b>flexible.</b> In a <b>last</b> step, we derive some general conclusions concerning reasonable strategies and applications of voluntary agreements within the European Union.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{what it means}} to patients afflicted by a minor heart attack to participate in cardiac rehabilitation (CR). CR is well-established internationally to support patients towards moving forward in satisfying, healthy, and well-functioning lives. Studies indicate that patients achieve improvement in quality of life when participating in CR. However, knowledge of how patients are supported during CR is sparse. Moreover, knowledge of what participating in CR means to patients afflicted by a minor heart attack is lacking. In-depth knowledge in this area is crucial in order to understand these patients’ particular gains and needs. In a phenomenological-hermeneutic frame field observations, focus group interviews, and individual interviews were conducted among 11 patients during and after their participation in CR. Field notes and transcribed interviews underwent three-phased interpretation. It was found that patients were supported to gain renewed balance in their lives during CR. Three themes were identified: (1) receiving a helpful but limited caring hand, (2) being supported to find new values in life, and (3) developing responsibility for the remaining time. The patients were carefully guided through a difficult time and supported to continue in healthy everyday lives. They were given hope which enabled them to find themselves a new foothold in life with respect to their own sense of well-being. This guidance and a sense of hopefulness were provided by heart specialists and more seasoned heart patients. In conclusion, patients were empowered to achieve a healthier lifestyle and improve their personal well-being during CR. However, structural barriers in the programme prevented adequate support regarding the patients’ total needs. Knowledge of the benefits of CR emphasizes the significance of the programme and highlights the importance of high inclusion.

The ceremony took place at Christ Church College in Oxford during the annual congress of the League. Technological convergence' is an expression depicting the blurring of boundaries between television and telecommunications. As a consequence of this process, the economic assumptions underlying legacy regulatory regimes no longer reflect market realities. Thus, technological convergence pushes for regulatory change, and this, in three directions: (i) deregulation, i. e. the removal of tools providing for exclusive and special rights; (ii) regulatory convergence, i. e. the creation of a level-playing-field between incumbents and new entrants and (iii) re-regulation, i. e. the introduction of new tools, either to replace legacy ones or to respond to emerging concerns. The first part of the dissertation examines the reaction to technological convergence in television and telecommunications regulation. While deregulation was unavoidable in both sectors, so pressing were technological developments, there are marked differences in other respects between them. Television regulation is an example of a 'defensive' reaction, in the sense that steps towards regulatory convergence and re-regulation have been slow and incremental. As a result, legislation is remarkably unstable and distortions, unavoidable. In addition, competition law has emerged as a source of regulation to deal with some concerns neglected in explicit regulatory regimes. In the telecommunications sector, by contrast, the Regulatory Framework for electronic communications constitutes an attempt to lay down, ex novo, a <b>flexible</b> and <b>lasting</b> regime. The second part examines choices around 'conflict points' between regimes, i. e. those areas of substantive overlap between the three sources of regulation identified above. Two conclusions follow from the analysis. First, it appears that one must differentiate, for normative purposes, between regulatory objectives (pluralism, effective competition, harmonisation [...] .) and the specific tools through which these are implemented. In this sense, it seems feasible and justified to reconcile conflicting objectives across the value chain along the lines of tools that are more suited to apply in a changing environment. Secondly, it is noted that television and telecommunications activities are so inextricably linked that any attempt to regulate one of the two sectors in isolation from the other, as is currently the case, is artificial and unsustainable...|$|R
40|$| {{about current}} language-problems in Switzerland. These were {{examined}} {{from every angle}} by a committee of experts. It concluded that Raeto- Romansch was in its death-throes and that even the Italian language was not beyond danger. In addition, the experts claimed that the rapid advance of English and also the Mundartwelle – the penetration of the media, {{and to some extent}} also the domain of the written word, by Swiss German dialect – marked a trend that put the Swiss national identity in jeopardy: four-language Switzerland was in danger of becoming two-and-a-halflanguage Switzerland. This may have meant the reduction of Italian to internal use, alongside German and French, or the prospect of English becoming the language of V V communication between Swiss people of differing language-groups who had only rudimentary knowledge of another national language besides their own. However, the extensive debates and parliamentary deliberations about the language clause then revealed how complex and fraught with contradiction was the task of balancing differing – indeed, opposing – principles for preserving linguistic harmony in Switzerland. Anyone who is familiar with this great national challenge – which is far from being finally resolved – will take care not to go around hawking multilingual Switzerland as a readymade blueprint for solving nationality conflicts. The revised language clause, which was eventually adopted in a referendum in 1996, leaves almost everything as it was. Since it is impossible to ignore the way in which Switzerland came into being, or its democratic institutions, or its political culture, geared to compromise and balance, any attempt to distil a few "inexpensive" remedies from it, for use on differently configured situations, is precluded. To this extent, the question in my title must be answered in the negative. None the less, study of Switzerland, and a knowledge of the country, will provide some helpful stimuli and pointers for the international debate about nationalism. The most important of these are probably the following: – Where religious, territorial-cum-cantonal, and ethnic affiliations are not congruent, but cut across each other in multiple ways, the ethnic majority–minority dividing-line is broken; this puts almost every grouping (depending on the constellation) in a minority in the political decision-making process; it creates pressure to enter into comparatively flexible compromises and coalitions and arouses the expectation that the majority – which the party concerned may well form part of on the next occasion – will take political account of others. – A comparatively well-developed form of federalism, which guarantees a high degree of individual self-government and democratic participation, can weaken the pull of the nationality-principle, especially when the neighbouring nation-states are extremely centralistically structured. – Combined with extensive power-sharing, the very marked ideological handing-down of historical particularisms and heterogeneous peculiarities {{within the framework of the}} whole helps prevent democracy from being reduced to the majority principle, and the majority culture from being asserted to the detriment of the others. Switzerland has developed numerous forms of over-representation and active economic and cultural support for minorities as a way of ensuring their integration. – Switzerland’s concordance-based democracy differs not just from the Westminster model of parliamentary rule, but from many others too, by virtue of its extensive and much-used instruments of direct democracy. The way in which the federal state came into being, the federalist institutions, and the constraints of concordance democracy have generated a political culture which, on every issue, aims at power-sharing. This is articulated not only in the territorial, religious, and ethnic differences; it also shows in the balance of power between cantons, federation, government, and people, which is geared to compromise and coalition, and in social bargaining – as witnessed in the collective labour-agreements in the metal-working and watch-making industries. VI – The territoriality principle, which defines the limits of linguistic freedom in Switzerland, has been one of the major methods by which linguistic harmony has been preserved. But it is no cure-all – as the debate about the revision of the language clause in the constitution revealed. Where the survival of minorities is under threat, the territoriality principle has to be applied in a <b>flexible</b> way. – <b>Last</b> but not least, the cultivation of historically generated cantonal particularisms in the face of national trends towards standardization compelled the Swiss very early on to seek compromises and maintain a liberal and tolerant stance. One dimension of this is the recurrent and challenging experience, known to every Swiss child, of realizing that there are people who, though linguistically different, are unquestionably also part of its own world, and must therefore be respected...|$|R
