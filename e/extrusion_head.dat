5000|$|Another {{milestone}} {{in the development}} of the modern marshmallow was the extrusion process by the Greek American confectioner Alex Doumak in 1954. In this process, marshmallow mixture is pumped through <b>extrusion</b> <b>heads</b> with numerous ports aligned next to each other which form long continuous [...] "ropes" [...] of marshmallow. This invention allowed marshmallows to be manufactured in a fully automated way, and gives us the familiar cylindrical shape of today's marshmallow. In today's modern marshmallow processing plants, the following process may be used to make marshmallows in large quantities. In large industrial kettles, water, sugar, and corn syrup are heated to a precise temperature and cooked for a precise time. This mixture is then pumped to another kettle to cool. Re-hydrated gelatin is added and blended in, once the mixture has cooled enough to not denature the gelatin. To give the marshmallow its fluffiness, it is pumped through a blender while air is pumped into it. At this point, it still needs to be cooled down further, so it will hold its shape when extruded, it is pumped through a heat exchanger prior to being pumped through the <b>extrusion</b> <b>heads</b> and onto a wide conveyor belt. The conveyor belt is coated in corn starch and more corn starch is dusted onto the top of the marshmallow extrusion as it passes down the conveyor. A large knife the width of the conveyor is located at the end of this conveyor table that will then chop the extrusion into the size marshmallow desired. The pieces will then be tumbled in corn starch in a large drum, in order for the marshmallow to form its familiar skin and to allow pieces that did not get cut all the way to break apart.|$|R
40|$|Many forging, <b>extrusion,</b> <b>heading</b> {{and other}} metal forming {{processes}} use graphite-based lubricants, phosphate coatings, and other potentially hazardous or harmful substances {{to improve the}} tribology of the metal forming process. The application of phosphate-based coatings has long been studied to determine if other synthetic ''clean'' lubricants could provide {{the same degree of}} protection afforded by phoscoatings and its formulations. So far, none meets the cost and performance objectives provided by phoscoatings as a general aid to the metal forming industry. In as much as phoscoatings and graphite have replaced lead-based lubricants, the metal forming industry has had previous experience with a legislated requirement to change processes. However, without a proactive approach to phoscoating replacement, many metal forming processes could find themselves without a cost effective tribology material necessary for the metal forming proces...|$|R
50|$|The nozzle can {{be moved}} in both {{horizontal}} and vertical directions by a numerically controlled mechanism. The nozzle follows a tool-path controlled by a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software package, and the part is built from the bottom up, one layer at a time. Stepper motors or servo motors are typically employed to move the <b>extrusion</b> <b>head.</b> The mechanism used is often an X-Y-Z rectilinear design, although other mechanical designs such as deltabot have been employed.|$|E
50|$|Co{{extrusion}} is the extrusion {{of multiple}} layers of material simultaneously. This type of extrusion utilizes two or more extruders to melt and deliver a steady volumetric throughput of different viscous plastics to a single <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> (die) which will extrude the materials in the desired form. This technology is used {{on any of the}} processes described above (blown film, overjacketing, tubing, sheet). The layer thicknesses are controlled by the relative speeds and sizes of the individual extruders delivering the materials.|$|E

Revolving sets of blow molds capture the parison or parisons as they pass over the <b>extrusion</b> <b>head.</b> The revolving sets of molds are located on clamp [...] "stations".|$|E

For the backward <b>extrusion</b> and the <b>head</b> nosing, the tool geometries were designed based on the desired configuration of the aluminum liner. Furthermore, the structural integrity of the tooling was evaluated to ensure adequate tool life. The seamless aluminum liner has an endurance limit of about 1. 47 MPa (15 Kgf/cm 2), estimated based on the required inner pressure.

30|$|Radiographic {{outcomes}} {{were determined by}} preoperative, post-operative as well as biannual radiographs after surgery; these included a standing anteroposterior view of the pelvis. Acetabular coverage was evaluated by measuring <b>extrusion</b> index (EI: <b>head</b> width divided by width of head covered by the acetabulum) [12] and lateral center edge angles (LCEA) [13]. To assess the neck-shaft angle and see the greater trochanter better, an anteroposterior radiograph of the involved hip was obtained with the limb rotated inward 15 °. We measured neck-shaft angles and noted the degree of femoral head involvement, stage of the disease (fragmentation versus healing) and relative limb lengths, and evaluated Shenton’s line [14]. We determined the center-head trochanteric distance (CTD), {{the height of the}} tip of the greater trochanter relative {{to the center of the}} hip, and deemed a positive value as the center of the head being above the tip of the greater trochanter [15] (Fig.  1 d).|$|R
50|$|In fused {{deposition}} modeling, the model or part {{is produced by}} extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder). The nozzle head heats the material and turns the flow on and off. Typically stepper motors or servo motors are employed to move the <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> and adjust the flow. The printer usually has 3 axes of motion. A computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software package is used to generate the G-Code that is sent to a microcontroller which controls the motors.|$|E
5000|$|Liquids are {{encapsulated}} using {{a rotating}} <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> containing concentric nozzles. In this process, a jet of core liquid {{is surrounded by}} a sheath of wall solution or melt. As the jet moves through the air it breaks, owing to Rayleigh instability, into droplets of core, each coated with the wall solution. While the droplets are in flight, the molten wall may be hardened or a solvent may be evaporated from the wall solution. Since most of the droplets are within ± 10% of the mean diameter, they land in a narrow ring around the spray nozzle. Hence, if needed, the capsules can be hardened after formation by catching them in a ring-shaped hardening bath. This process is excellent for forming particles [...] in diameter. Since the drops are formed by the breakup of a liquid jet, the process is only suitable for liquid or slurries. A high production can be achieved, up to 22.5 kg of microcapsules can be produced per nozzle per hour.|$|E
50|$|Though {{they have}} usually {{prevented}} {{far more serious}} accidents, guardrail is considered a roadside obstacle as well and transportation engineers must weigh whether placing guardrail will reduce the severity of an impact as compared to what may be impacted if the guardrail were not placed. In general, the minimum length of guardrail with an end anchor at the trailing end and an end terminal on the approach end will be 62.5 to 75 feet in length. An example would be where an overhead roadside sign structure is placed within what is considered the clear recovery zone, and an engineer determines that the structure has a potential to be impacted {{and the impact of}} a vehicle withthat structure would be much more severe than impacting the guardrail that was placed to contain and redirect a vehicle away from that structure, knowing that the potential to impact the guardrail will be much higher than that of the sign structure. Guardrail has frequently ranked amongst the highest sources of injury and fatality collisions with a fixed-object crash. Among the primary reasons for {{this is the type of}} treatment used at the end of the guardrail facing oncoming traffic. Most end terminal designs will either gate and allow a vehicle to pass through the system within the first 12.5 feet or redirect a vehicle if impacted beyond the first 12.5 feet. Some end terminals also have energy absorbing properties when impacted in the head on position, and will actually slow a vehicle upon impact by absorbing the vehicles kinetic energy and dispersing it through the rail. This is typically accomplished by forcing rail elements through an extrusion impact head that has smaller dimensions that the rail being forced through it. The force rate and flattening of the rail through the head absorbs kinetic energy dissipating it through the <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> and slowing the vehicle. These types of systems have demonstrated that an errant vehicle, impacting a system in the head on position, can be effectively stopped in a distance of 50 feet or less. As compared to non-energy absorbing end terminals which can allow a vehicle to pass through the system and travel in excess of 250 feet behind and beyond the system.|$|E
5000|$|Twisties {{are also}} {{sold on the}} Italian market with the name ''''Fonzies''''. [...] Fonzies are pale yellow in colour, {{because they do not}} use the bright orange food {{colouring}} that normal Twisties use. As well as this, they are easier to chew because they're baked, unlike its Australian inspiration which is fried. Their cheese flavouring is very similar to that used in the Oceanian varieties bearing the 'Twisties' name, lighter and less prone to clump together during consumption, and with a more natural cheese flavour. The only quality that differentiates it from said varieties is its slight egg-like taste upon first bite, though it wears away after continued consumption. It is made through the same rotary <b>head</b> <b>extrusion</b> technique as in all other localisations, though the snacks are much smaller than those found in Australia, sticking more to a general thin shape rather than a selection of both thin and stout snacks. Its smell is much more pungent, as well. Fonzies are available in 'Gli Originali' ('Original') flavour, as well as 'Time Out', 'Choco', 'Hot Passion', 'Bacon','Hot Chili' and others.|$|R
40|$|Fusarium graminearum is {{a species}} of fungal {{pathogens}} known to cause Fusarium head blight impacting grain quality and yield of Norwegian wheat. The genetic background of this disease have been studied {{over the past two}} decades. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), also called association mapping, have proven to be powerful tools in identifying the genetic composition of complex traits. In this thesis, markers from the 90 K SNP array with phenotypic data for a core collection of 172 MASBASIS spring and winter wheat lines from 2014 and previous years were analysed with the mixed linear model in Tassel correcting for kinship and population structure. STRUCTURE identified 8 subpopulations in MASBASIS differentiated by geographic origin and spring and winter growth habits. A total of 22 031 markers for spring wheat, and 16091 for winter wheat were used to identify significant markers for earliness, plant height, anther <b>extrusion,</b> Fusarium <b>head</b> blight and mycotoxin deoxynivalenol. All traits were discovered to hold significant markers around previously discovered QTL, indicating that genes controlling these traits may be located at positions around the markers of significance. Heritabilities calculated from analyses of variance demonstrated that the percentages of the observed variances resulting from genetics was much lower for FHB than for DON, suggesting a great impact of environmental effects and experimental error, such as weather and scoring, on the rate of disease. The usefulness of using FHB as a trait in genome-wide association mapping, compared to DON, must therefore be individually determined. DON is considered the most important trait due to the yield and quality loss from mycotoxin infected grain, and gave both high heritability and significant markers from the association mapping from this study. From the field trial of 2014, Norwegian breeding lines had relatively low values for DON compared to the susceptible lines, indicating that breeding for Fusarium resistance have been successful. However, compared to the highly resistant source Sumai 3, there {{is still a long way}} to go. Further analyses of resistance is recommended to identify the genes underlying traits for resistance and the specific lines carrying these for use in breeding programmes. M-BIO...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{diagnosis}} of femoroacetabular impingement {{is based on}} clinical symptoms, physical exam findings, and radiographic abnormalities. The study objective {{was to determine the}} radiographic findings that correlate with and are predictive of hip pain in femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). One hundred prospective patients with unilateral FAI symptoms based on clinical and radiographic findings were included in this study. All patients filled out a WOMAC pain questionnaire. Two independent-blinded surgeons assessed antero-posterior and lateral radiographs for 33 radiographic parameters of FAI. Correlations between pain scores and radiographic findings were calculated. A matched radiographic analysis was performed comparing symptomatic versus asymptomatic hips. Radiograph findings were also compared between males and females. Weak positive correlations were identified between increasing pain scores with radiographic findings of posterior wall dysplasia, presence of a shallow socket, and a more lateral acetabular fossa relative to the Ilioischial line. A symptomatic hip had a lower neck shaft angle, greater distance from Ilioischial line to acetabular fossa and larger distance from cross-over sign to superolateral point of the acetabulum when compared to the asymptomatic hip in the same patient. Symptomatic hips in males had more joint space narrowing, femoral osteophytes, higher alpha angles and larger, more incongruent femoral heads compared to females. Females had more medial acetabular fossa relative to the Ilioischial line and smaller femoral <b>head</b> <b>extrusion</b> index. Similar to other musculoskeletal conditions, radiographic findings of FAI are poor predictors of hip pain...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the problem {{of an increase in}} product returns for a company that produces plastic films for flexible packaging. Among the factors that have resulted in the increase of returned products are defects in the films caused by the poor manipulation of materials and, above all, the hard point in the coils caused by excessive extruder preparation time, causing the <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> to overheat as well as uneven extrusion. Extrusion is a key process in the production of plastic materials as it transforms polypropylene and additives into plastic sheets. The delay in the preparation time caused by machine operators leads to the overheating of the <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> and, therefore, defective products that are ultimately returned to the company by customers. In order to confront this problem, a proposal was developed using the SMED tool of Lean Manufacturing {{in order to reduce the}} preparation time of the extruder and to increase the productivity of the company.

40|$|Background: The Bernese (Ganz) periacetabular {{osteotomy}} is {{an effective}} surgical procedure to reorient the acetabu-lum, allowing restoration of anatomic femoral head coverage and medial translation of the hip in adults with hip dysplasia. However, it is a challenging surgical procedure, and we know of no study that has specifically analyzed the complications and associated factors seen with this procedure in adolescent patients. Methods: A retrospective clinical and radiographic review of a consecutive series of adolescent patients who underwent a Bernese periacetabular osteotomy for hip dysplasia was conducted. Results: Eighty-three osteotomies were performed in seventy-six patients {{with an average age}} (and standard deviation) of 15. 6 ± 2. 4 years. Significant improvement from the preoperative to the two-year follow-up evaluation was seen radiographically with regard to the lateral center-edge angle (– 0. 14 to 35. 5), the ventral center-edge angle (– 5. 13 to 31. 3), and the femoral <b>head</b> <b>extrusion</b> index (38. 4 % to 7. 7 %) (p < 0. 0001 for all). There were three major complications, including excessive arterial bleeding requiring embolization in a patient with a prior acetabuloplasty, osteonecrosis of the acetabular fragment in a patient with severe dysplasia and subluxation of the hip, and osteonecrosis of the femoral head following combined periacetabular and femoral osteotomies in a patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Eighteen hips (22 %) had minor complications, including nonunion of the superior pubic ramus osteotomy (five hips), a superficial stitch abscess (four), and transient lateral femoral cutaneous nerve palsy (four).

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Four {{winter and}} four spring barley cultivars {{along with their}} F₁ hybrids were grown on the Hyslop Agronomy Farm near Corvallis, Oregon, a high {{rainfall}} site (over 1000 mm annually) located in the Willamette Valley. The experiment consisted of four replications. Ten seeds of each F₁ and parents were seeded in a three meter row. Plants were spaced 30 cm between and within the rows. Investigations were made to evaluate the presence of hybrid vigor when hybridizing winter and spring barley. Gene action estimates contributing to yield and its components were obtained. Additional information concerning the inheritance and the association of 12 agronomic traits and yield were also evaluated. The data were analyzed by using the factorial technique, analysis of variance, correlations, path-coefficient, parent-progeny regressions, and by polynomial and multiple regressions. The traits measured were: (1) total yield per plant, (2) kernel weight, (3) tiller number per plant, (4) kernel number per spike, (5) heading date, (6) plant height, (7) flag leaf area, (8) flag leaf width, (9) flag leaf length, (10) culm diameter, (11) head length, and (12) <b>head</b> <b>extrusion.</b> Heterobeltiosis was observed {{in all of the}} hybrids except in the cross between Adair and Short Wocus. The absence of hybrid vigor in this cross may be attributed to the fact that these two parents are closely related. Combining ability analysis as well as narrow sense heritability estimates indicated that additive gene action is more predominant in the expression of heading date, plant height, tiller number, head length, culm diameter, flag leaf width and kernel weight. Heterobeltiosis and high SCA estimates were observed in most of the hybrids for yield per plant and kernel number per spike. This implies that most of the genetic variation associated with these two traits resulted from non-additive gene action. The high SCA estimate observed for <b>head</b> <b>extrusion</b> indicates that this trait appeared to be controlled by non-additive gene action. Both additive and nonadditive gene action are important for the expression of flag leaf area and flag leaf length. When the 12 traits were correlated and the r values partitioned into direct and indirect effects it was observed that tiller number, kernel weight and kernel number per spike exerted the highest direct effect on yield. Plant height had a small positive direct effect, but an indirect effect on yield through kernel weight. It was further observed that a negative association exists between tiller number and kernel weight. This indicates that, in this barley population, {{it would be difficult to}} select for a plant containing large grain type and short stature, but it may be easy to select short plants with a relatively large number of tillers and high kernel number per spike. Path coefficient analysis indicated further that flag leaf area has a negative direct effect on yield and the remaining six traits have a negligible or no direct effect on yield, indicating that these traits can not be used as selection criteria. More genetic variability for tiller number and kernel number per spike was noted in the winter barley while more genetic variability for kernel weight was found in the spring barley. The results of this study suggest that increases in yield could be achieved by selecting plants with relatively high tiller number and high kernel weight. Selection for a high kernel number per spike can be accomplished by selecting for large culms and longer peduncle. By this procedure the breeder can take advantage of the additive genetic variance associated with tiller number and kernel weight and by the positive correlation that exists between culm size and peduncle length with kernel number per spike...|$|R
2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an <b>extrusion</b> nozzle <b>head</b> (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|R
40|$|Digital {{fabrication}} tools, specifically {{additive manufacturing}} systems, have consistently advanced in efficiencies such as print speed, gantry size, material cost {{and ease of}} use. However most of these systems remain limited {{in their ability to}} enable automated mixing and extrusion of multiple materials with variable properties on large scales. This thesis focuses on the first steps of realizing this enabling technology by operating across two distinct trajectories. The first aims at digitally controlling precision path placement of material with high levels of tunability through analog mixing, while the second explores do-it-yourself tool customization, compactness, portability and the possibility of fabrication node-to-node communication. Inspired by the silkworm's ability to spin highly sophisticated and tunable material architectures, the aim of this thesis is to develop an enabling technology for digital fabrication requiring high levels of material tunability in product and architectural scales. Specifically, I designed, developed, built and evaluated an array of six unique customizable and compact deposition heads for tunable material properties. Amongst those tools is a freeform <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> for tunable geometry without the need for auxiliary support structure; a fast thread deposition head and a fiber winding head for tunable compressive and tensile strength respectively; a portable cable-suspended paste droplet <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> for tunable drop size of paste material; and a chitosan gel <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> for tunable plasticity using biomaterials. Operating across the two trajectories of tunability and portability, this thesis argues that highly tunable, compact and portable extrusion heads developed within a Fab Lab environment can support variable property printing of one or more materials outside of commercial based systems. This capability will in the future enable the digital fabrication of larger-scale prototypes, sustainable products and architectural structures inspired by nature in Fab Lab settings. by Jared Smith Laucks.

Th e infl uence of raw materials on soybean pressing system and the parameters of extrusion process are analyzed. Principally, the experiments confi rm the infl uences of heat process parameters in case of soybean press cakes production using classic solutions and microwave energy. Th ese experiments start up by manufacturing soybean press cake in industrial conditions at “S. C. International romoster srl ” – Dudestii Vechi, Timis County. For ensuring the best conditions, the experimental stand included an extruder, a system for toasting the soybeans press cake, a system for parameters ’ control and the system for ensuring the processing of water. Th e following possibilities were analyzed: (1) Soybeans press cake obtained by the classical method without toasting at pressure of extrusion p 1 = 75 kgf cm- 2 and fl ow Q 1 = 800 kg h- 1; (2) Soybeans press cake obtained at pressure of <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> p 2 = 85 kgf cm- 2 and fl ow Q 2 = 600 kg h- 1; (3) Soybeans press cake obtained at pressure of <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> p 3 = 95 kgf cm- 2 and fl ow Q 3 = 300 kg h- 1; Using this application we tested a new method for treatment and studied the special systems which can be applied in industrial practice at “S.

40|$|To {{reveal the}} {{potential}} {{and limits of}} multi-material three-dimensional (3 D) printed parts in droplet-based additive manufacturing, a study combining tensile experiments and 3 D imaging technique is proposed. A polymeric composite structure made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and thermoplastic polyurethane is manufactured using a two <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> printer. The quality of the interface between the two thermoplastics is quantified by adjusting the number of intertwining droplets at the interface. Tensile experiments assisted with digital image correlation are performed with two-interface orientation to discriminate shearing and traction at the interface. The 3 D imaging results, {{which are based on}} X-ray micro-tomography, show the distinct features of droplet-based additive manufacturing in terms of porosity content and connectivity. Interface properties are found to control, in an incomparable way, the mechanical response. It is found that the interface quality is determinant for enhancing the ultimate performance whereas the interface orientation is found to be the perfect leverage for varying the slope of the linear part...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a new {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) system based on extrusion and 3 D deposition of a mixture of metal (or advanced ceramic) powder and polymeric binder is described in this paper. The proposed system is totally innovative in terms of combination of deposited work material, extrusion system (head and nozzle), and deposition work table, {{which is based on}} a 5 -axes parallel kinematics machine (PKM). The <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> and nozzle have been designed {{in order to be able}} to extrude high viscosity mixtures with low polymeric content. The 5 -axes PKM is aimed at obtaining a good surface quality of the deposited work and reducing the need for supports during deposition. After the deposition, the material is de-binded and sintered to nearly the density of the solid material as-cast. The design and kinematics of the machine and especially the PKM table is described in this paper, the main design issues are discussed and some preliminary extrusion and sintering results are presented...|$|E
40|$|Current Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) {{techniques}} use fixed diameter nozzles {{to deposit}} a filament of plastic layer by layer. The consequence {{is that the}} same small nozzle, essential for fine details, is also used to fill in relatively large volumes. In practice a Pareto-optimal nozzle diameter is chosen that attempts to maximise resolution while minimising build time. This paper introduces a concept for adapting an additive manufacturing system, which exploits a variable diameter nozzle for the fused deposition of polymers. The variable nozzle allows the print resolution and the build speed to become independent variables which may be optimised. The paper discusses a concept design for the variable diameter nozzle to be fitted to a RapMan 3 D printer and the software used to generate the tool paths for the <b>extrusion</b> <b>head.</b> The methodology involves the use of existing software solutions to gather basic data from STL files and generate the tool paths. A method for integrating the data and the deposition system is proposed. The challenges and possibilities of the technology are discussed as well as future research...|$|E
40|$|When forming {{products}} from thermoplastic polymers and compositions on their basis, including sheet blanks, are passing heat and mechanical processes, which require special study: heating and cool-ing, viscous-plastic flow, sealing and shrinkage, the deformation of viscous stretching, consolidation. For sheet workpieces made of recycled polypropylene {{it was determined}} the kinetics of cooling in two modes: convective heat transfer in air and contact heat exchange in the chilled form. The work-pieces sheets for the study were obtained at the <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> of the manifold type. When molding product the experiment took place in conditions that {{are very close to}} real. Temperature measurement was carried out on the surface and {{in the center of the}} workpiece. To obtain the temperature profile across the thickness of the blank numerical analysis on the basis of the solution of the heat equation for one-dimensional flow was carried out. It is shown that the results of analytical calculation and experiment correlate well.

40|$|There {{has been}} a trend {{in recent years to}} develop {{polyetheretherketone}} (PEEK) -based medical devices due to the excellent cell biocompatibility and desirable mechanical properties of PEEK, which has elastic modulus comparable to cortical bone. Different manufacturing techniques such as injection moulding, particulate leaching, compression moulding, and selective laser sintering (SLS) have been used to produce porous PEEK for biomedical applications. Despite a large number of publications on extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) of porous structures using various materials, there have been very few general reports on extrusion AM of low quality small PEEK parts without defects such as warpage and delamination and no further assessment of mechanical properties. Successful low-cost 3 D printing of PEEK structures using filamentbased extrusion AM process is reported in this paper for the first time. Hot <b>extrusion</b> <b>head</b> design, extrusion temperature, and ambient temperature were identified as important factors need to be taken into consideration for printing PEEK structures without warpage, delamination, and polymer degradation. Compression and tensile tests were conducted to investigate mechanical properties of these new 3 D printed PEEK structures. The air gap between infill pattern and entrapped micro-bubbles inside filaments were identified as the main source of mechanical properties reduction. In addition, three-point flexural test was performed on the 3 D printed PEEK and compared with flexural specimens printed using other AM materials and techniques. status: publishe...|$|E
