5|$|Breeding {{experiments}} to study evolution and genetics. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are inbred through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics. These provide animals of a known <b>genetic</b> <b>background,</b> {{an important tool}} for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction, though some scientists take advantage of inbred domesticated animals, such as dog or cattle breeds, for comparative purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their niche) produce adaptations in their physiology and morphology. As an example, sticklebacks are now being used to study how many and which types of mutations are selected to produce adaptations in animals' morphology during the evolution of new species.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{predisposition}} for DPB susceptibility {{has been}} localized to two HLA haplotypes (a nucleotide or gene sequence difference between paired chromosomes, {{that is more}} likely to occur among a common ethnicity or trait) common to people of East Asian descent. HLA-B54 is associated with DPB in the Japanese, while HLA-A11 is associated with the disease in Koreans. Several genes within this region of class I HLA are believed to be responsible for DPB, by allowing increased susceptibility to the disease. The common <b>genetic</b> <b>background</b> and similarities in the HLA profile of affected Japanese and Korean individuals were considered in the search for a DPB gene. It was suggested that a mutation of a suspected disease-susceptibility gene located somewhere between HLA-B and HLA-A had occurred on an ancestral chromosome carrying both HLA-B54 and HLA-A11. Further, it is possible that a number of genetic recombination events around the disease locus (location on a chromosome) could have resulted in the disease being associated with HLA-B54 in the Japanese and HLA-A11 in Koreans. After further study, it was concluded that a DPB susceptibility gene is located near the HLA-B locus at chromosome 6p21.3. Within this area, the search for a genetic cause of the disease has continued.|$|E

25|$|Epistasis is the {{phenomenon}} where {{the effect of}} one gene (locus) {{is dependent on the}} presence of one or more 'modifier genes', i.e. the <b>genetic</b> <b>background.</b> Originally the term meant that the phenotypic effect of one gene is masked by a different gene (locus). Thus, epistatic mutations have different effects in combination than individually. It was originally a concept from genetics but is now used in biochemistry, computational biology and evolutionary biology. It arises due to interactions, either between genes, or within them, leading to non-linear effects. Epistasis has a large influence on the shape of evolutionary landscapes, which leads to profound consequences for evolution and evolvability of phenotypic traits.|$|E

Men who have a first-degree relative (father or brother) with prostate cancer have twice {{the risk of developing}} prostate cancer, and those with two first-degree relatives affected have a fivefold greater risk compared with men with no family history. In the United States, prostate cancer more commonly affects black men than white or Hispanic men, and is also more deadly in black men. In contrast, the incidence and mortality rates for Hispanic men are one third lower than for non-Hispanic whites. Studies of twins in Scandinavia suggest that 40% of prostate cancer risk can be explained by inherited factors.|$|E
25|$|Classical plant {{breeding}} uses deliberate interbreeding (crossing) of closely or distantly related individuals to produce new crop varieties or lines with desirable properties. Plants are crossbred to introduce traits/genes from one variety or line {{into a new}} <b>genetic</b> <b>background.</b> For example, a mildew-resistant pea may be crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, {{the goal of the}} cross being to introduce mildew resistance without losing the high-yield characteristics. Progeny from the cross would then be crossed with the high-yielding parent to ensure that the progeny were most like the high-yielding parent, (backcrossing). The progeny from that cross would then be tested for yield and mildew resistance and high-yielding resistant plants would be further developed. Plants may also be crossed with themselves to produce inbred varieties for breeding.|$|E
30|$|Thermotolerant yeast strains {{are still}} {{required}} in bio-industries. Various approaches {{have been adopted}} {{in an attempt to}} improve the thermotolerance of yeast strains, including the use of mating, fusion or genetic hybridization (Pasha et al.

However, these approaches were based on stochasticity and used various yeast strains with different <b>genetic</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> It is thus difficult to draw conclusions from these studies that would help in the acquisition of more thermotolerant strains. The results presented here are applicable to various strains that have different <b>genetic</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> It may also be possible to use these results to quantify and evaluate thermotolerance, and for the systematic construction of more thermotolerant strains.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We study gene {{expression}} data, derived from developing tissues, under multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> (mutations). Motivated by the perceived behavior under these background, our main goals are to explore time windows questions: 1) Find a large {{set of genes}} that have a similar behavior in two different <b>genetic</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> under an appropriate time shift. 2) Find a model that approximates the dynamics of a gene network in developing tissues at different continuous time windows. We first explain the biological significance of these problems, and then explore their computational complexity, which ranges from polynomial to NP-hard. We developed algorithms and heuristics for the different problems, and ran those on synthetic and biological data, with very encouraging results. ...|$|R
40|$|Two genes conferring {{the brown}} midrib (bmr) trait had been backcrossed into six elite sorghum lines, {{resulting}} in reduced lignin in the bmr lines {{when compared with}} the wild-type parent. Seed and leaf tissue from field-grown plants, planted at two locations, were screened for Alternariu spp. and Fusarium spp. on semi-selective media. The results suggest that bmr lines do not have increased susceptibility to colonization by Alternariu spp. However, significantly fewer colonies of Fusarium spp., including Fusarium moniliforme, were recovered from seed of reduced lignin lines from two <b>genetic</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> That the bmr trait in some <b>genetic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> might enable increased resistance to colonization by E moniliforme was further supported by greenhouse experiments in which peduncles of developing heads were inoculated with F moniliforme. Mean lesion measurements on bmr lines were significantly lower than those resulting from inoculations on wild-type lines. Analysis of near-isogenic lines revealed that mean lesion lengths on bmr lines were significantly less than those produced on their wild-type counterparts in four of the six <b>genetic</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> These results suggest that reduced lignin lines exhibit, in some cases, increased resistance to Fusarium spp., including E moniliforme...|$|R
25|$|In 2014, a {{research}} {{team led by}} Eric Quandt in the lab of Jeffrey Barrick at the University of Texas at Austin described {{the application of a}} new technique called Recursive Genomewide Recombination and Sequencing (REGRES) to identify potentiating mutations among the 70 present in the Ara-3 lineage that evolved Cit+. This method used multiple rounds of a process in which F plasmid based conjugation between a 33,000 generation Cit+ clone, CZB154, and the Cit− founding clone of the LTEE to purge mutations not required for either manifestation of a weak or strong form of the Cit+ trait, which they refer to as Cit++. They found that the rnk-citT module responsible for the phenotypic switch to Cit+ was sufficient to produce a weak Cit+ phenotype in the ancestor. They also identified a mutation that had occurred in the lineage leading to CZB154 after the initial evolution of Cit+ that conferred a strong, Cit++ phenotype in the ancestor absent any mutation but the rnk-citT module. This mutation, found in the regulatory region of a gene called dctA, caused a massive increase in the expression of the DctA transporter, which functions to import C4-dicarboxylates into the cell. This increased DctA expression, they found, permitted Cit+ cells to re-uptake succinate, malate, and fumarate released into the medium by the CitT transporter during import of citrate. They identified a similar mutation in Cit++ clones in the Ara-3 population that increased DctA expression by restoring function to a gene that regulates it, dcuS, that had been deactivated in the ancestral clone. Quandt et al. concluded that the dctA mutation was not involved in potentiation, but refinement. This led them to suggest that evolution of Cit+ in the Ara-3 population might have been contingent upon a <b>genetic</b> <b>background</b> and population-specific ecology that permitted the early, weak Cit+ variants to persist in the population long enough for refining mutations to arise and render growth on citrate strong enough to provide a significant fitness benefit.|$|E

Three su 1 maize populations [Country Gentleman (CG), Golden Bantam (GB), and Stowell's Evergreen (SE) ] and three Su 1 maize synthetics [EPS 6 (S) C 3 (EPS 6), EPS 7 (S) C 3 (EPS 7), and EPS 1 O] were crossed. The nine Fl populations were random mated three times. Kernel weight and germination of two phenotypic classes (Su 1 and su 1) were determined in each generation and in each of the nine populations and su 1 gene frequency was calculated. Frequency of su 1 decreased linearly through recombinations for all crosses, though the regression was not significant for EPs 7 x SE, EPS 7 x CG, and EPSlO x CG. The coefficients of linear regression were all negative and homogeneous. The coefficients of determination were generally above 0. 90.
