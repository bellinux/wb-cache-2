He stated he arrived in London on 31 October to attend the {{football}} match between Arsenal and CSKA Moscow on 1 November. When the news broke that a radioactive substance {{had been used to}} murder Litvinenko, a team of scientists rushed to find out <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> contamination had spread.

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{artillery}} guns were deployed, including heavier weapons, such as cannons, culverins and demi-cannons, and smaller pieces such as sakers, minions and falcons. Some older guns, for example slings and bases, were also deployed, but were less effective than newer weapons {{such as the}} culverin. With sites equipped with several tiers of weapons, the heaviest guns would typically be placed higher up in the fortification, with the smaller weapons closer to the ground. It is uncertain <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> guns of the period would have reached; analysis {{carried out in the}} 16th and 17th century on the ranges of artillery suggested that the largest weapons, such as a culverin, could hit a target up to between 1,600 and 2,743 metres (5,200ft and 8,999ft) away.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} most other non-avian theropods, Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not {{make contact with the}} ground and were not used for locomotion; instead they served a predatory function. The {{discovery}} of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus. The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> joints could move without dislocating. In many of the joints, the bones did not fit together exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints, as is seen in many living archosaurs. Among other findings, the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backwards slightly, the elbow bent, and the claws facing medially (inwards).|$|E

5|$|They {{followed}} {{next with}} Tenure in 2002, the double album Dilapidated Beauty in 2003, and The Road to Ellenside in 2006. In a review for Molinos, {{it was noted}} that The Paperboys consistently write pop songs with melodic hooks, which other prior Irish-rock inspired bands such as The Pogues and Oysterband, and others were not always successful at. Postcards, which has songs that range musically from bluegrass, zydeco, flamenco, Irish traditional, country, to Celtic-new-age-Native, and with songs that mix some of the themes, was described as a satisfying example of <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> versatile scope of The Paperboys' music extends.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Charles's reign, {{the issue}} of <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> English Reformation should {{progress}} was constantly brought {{to the forefront of}} political debate. Arminian theology emphasised clerical authority and the individual's ability to reject or accept salvation, and was consequently viewed as heretical and a potential vehicle for the reintroduction of Roman Catholicism by its Calvinist opponents. Charles's sympathy to the teachings of Arminianism, and specifically his wish to move the Church of England away from Calvinism in a more traditional and sacramental direction, were perceived by Puritans as irreligious tendencies. In addition, Charles's Protestant subjects followed news of the European war closely and grew increasingly dismayed by Charles's diplomacy with Spain and his failure to support the Protestant cause abroad effectively.|$|E
5|$|The player builds their {{character}} by spending acquired points {{to increase their}} ratings in the three areas. The points spent on Attributes and Abilities combine to determine a player's success or effectiveness in performing tasks such as using firearms, brawling, and lock-picking; for example, determining how accurate or <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> player can shoot, or if they can hack a computer. Attributes are represented by physical (strength, dexterity, and stamina), social (charisma, manipulation, and appearance), and mental (perception, intelligence, and wits). Abilities are talents (such as brawling and dodging), skills (such as firearms and melee) and knowledges (such as computers and investigation). The player is initially assigned points to spend in the three areas, with the amount they can spend determined by clan; for example, the Brujah can spend the most points on physical and skill attributes. During character creation, each upgrade costs one point. The upgrade cost increases as the game progresses. Each ability can be raised from zero to five, and {{it is impossible to}} accrue enough experience points to complete every skill (allowing the player to specialize or balance {{their character}}). Experience points are gained by completing quests, finding items or unlocking secret paths, rather than killing enemies, and are used to increase or unlock the character's statistics and abilities. The game features a main story, and optional side quests that can be completed at any time; the player is able to move between the available areas at will to revisit locations, characters, or merchants.|$|E

Specifically, we provide answers to the following questions: When system time is minimized, <b>how</b> <b>far</b> could <b>the</b> corresponding system cost deviate from its minimum value?
