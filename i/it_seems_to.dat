5|$|Thirdly, the teleological {{explanation}} of adaptation is uncomfortable because <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; because <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> attribute {{the action of}} a conscious mind when none {{is assumed to be}} present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test empirically.|$|E

5|$|Arabic astronomical {{contributions}} include Albatenius' {{discovery that}} {{the direction of}} the Sun's apogee (the place in the Sun's orbit against the fixed stars where <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be moving slowest) is changing. (In modern heliocentric terms, this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the Earth's orbit). Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.|$|E

5|$|Dimorphodon {{has been}} envisioned as a puffin {{analogue}} in the past, but its jaw structure and gait, combined with its poor flight capabilities, {{indicate that it}} was a terrestrial/semiarboreal feeder. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been a predator of small mammals and squamates, and possibly also preyed on large insects.|$|E
5|$|Ferret-legging was an {{endurance}} test or stunt in which ferrets {{were trapped in}} trousers worn by a participant. Also known as put 'em down and ferret-down-trousers, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been popular among coal miners in Yorkshire, England. Contestants put live ferrets inside their trousers; the winner {{is the one who}} is the last to release the animals. The world record is five hours and thirty minutes.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{frequently}} remarked, that <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been reserved {{to the people}} of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not, of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend, for their political constitutions, on accident and force.|$|E
60|$|When {{the first}} faintness {{consequent}} on having moved about had left him, he subsided into his former state. One of the night-tunes {{was playing in}} the wind, when {{the door of his}} room <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> open to a light touch, and, after a moment's pause, a quiet figure <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> stand there, with a black mantle on <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> draw the mantle off and drop it on the ground, and then <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be his Little Dorrit in her old, worn dress. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> tremble, and to clasp its hands, and to smile, and to burst into tears.|$|R

5|$|That man's a great director. He {{can make}} people feel {{perfectly}} natural. He's got what Chaplin did when he directed A Woman of Paris—he and Lewis Milestone and Mal St. Clair all have that same touch, they all belong to the new school of directors, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me. They're not so busy thinking about technique that they have actors turning into marionettes.|$|E
5|$|This classically {{designed}} wing {{has been}} attributed to Inigo Jones, but without supporting evidence; as with a similar attribution at Brympton d'Evercy, also in Somerset, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be based solely on the alternating segmental and pointed pediments over the groundfloor windows, and ignoring the irregularities in their spacings and placings, which Jones is unlikely to have countenanced.|$|E

In his eyes, she seemed distinguished. He was in a fair way to dote on her.|$|R

5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{play a role in the}} relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E
5|$|As the {{electrons}} pass through this complex, four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Exactly how this occurs is unclear, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> involve conformational changes in complex I {{that cause the}} protein to bind protons on the N-side of the membrane and release them on the P-side of the membrane. Finally, {{the electrons}} are transferred from the chain of iron–sulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in the membrane. Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to ubiquinol (QH2).|$|E
5|$|Construction of Lund Cathedral in Scania {{started in}} about 1103 when {{the region was}} part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It was the first of great Danish Romanesque cathedrals {{in the shape of a}} three-aisled {{basilica}} with transepts. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been related to earlier German buildings, though there are also traces of Anglo-Norman and Lombard influences. Ribe, which followed with its great cathedral (1150–1250), had close trade contacts with the Rhine region of Germany. Both the materials, sandstone and tufa, and the models were taken from there.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1940, Steinbeck and Ricketts hired a Monterey Bay sardine fishing boat, the Western Flyer, with a four-man crew, {{and spent}} six weeks {{travelling}} {{the coast of}} the Gulf of California collecting biological specimens. Along with Ricketts and the four crew members mentioned in the book, Steinbeck was accompanied by his wife, Carol. Steinbeck hoped that the trip would help rescue their failing marriage, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have had the opposite effect: the marriage ended soon after they returned. Steinbeck's lawyer and friend, Toby Street, was also on board as far as San Diego.|$|E
5|$|For most girls, {{childhood}} {{came to an}} {{end with}} the onset of puberty, which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage. Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, romantic love was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss of a loved one was an inalienable part of life. The main form of birth control was abstinence, and while there is evidence of contraception <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been mainly used by prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|Grissom may not ask {{to take on}} {{the role}} of mentor, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> happen naturally, going {{all the way back to}} Sara Sidle when they first met in San Francisco, then Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders in Vegas. Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times, he is visibly proud when they succeed, as Greg did by passing his field test and {{becoming}} a CSI. He is also protective of his staff and defends them as much as he can, as seen in episode 521 ("Rashomama") for example.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} {{on the history}} of bughouse, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have {{developed}} in the early 1960s. It is now quite popular as a diversion of regular chess in local chess clubs throughout Europe and the US. Grandmasters such as Joel Benjamin, Yasser Seirawan, Andy Soltis, John Nunn, Jon Speelman, Sergey Karjakin, Michael Adams, Emil Sutovsky and Michael Rohde have been known to play the game. One of the strongest matches on record took place following the 2014 Sinquefield Cup, with Magnus Carlsen and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave teaming up against Fabiano Caruana and Levon Aronian – all four being among the top ten chess players in the world at the time.|$|E
5|$|Panpsychism is {{the view}} that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of {{experience}} or point of view. Superficially, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{be a form of}} property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say mechanical behaviour is derived from primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to {{the presence or absence of}} complex structure in a compound object. So long as the reduction of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.|$|E
5|$|Skopje {{has some}} remains of Prehistorical {{architecture}} {{which can be}} seen on the Tumba Madžari Neolithic site. On {{the other side of the}} city lie the remains of the ancient Scupi, with ruins of a theatre, thermae and a basilica. The Skopje Aqueduct, located between Scupi and the city centre, is rather mysterious because its date of construction is unknown. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been built by the Byzantines or the Turks, but it was already out of use in the 16th century. It consists of 50 arches, worked in cloisonné masonry.|$|E
