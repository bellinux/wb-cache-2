25|$|Another thermo-responsive gel is {{one that}} is formed by {{combining}} chitosan with glycerophosphate (GP) salt. This solution experiences <b>gelation</b> at temperatures above 37°C. <b>Gelation</b> of chitosan/GP is rather slow, taking half an hour to initially set and 9 more hours to completely stabilize. Gel strength varies from 67 to 1572 Pa depending on the concentration of chitosan; the lower end of this range approaches the stiffness of brain tissue. Chitosan/GP has shown success in vitro, but the addition of polylysine is needed to enhance nerve cell attachment. Polylysine was covalently bonded to chitosan in order to prevent it from diffusing away. Polylysine was selected because of its positive nature and high hydrophilicity, which promotes neurite growth. Neuron survival was doubled, though neurite outgrowth did not change with the added polylysine.|$|E
25|$|In {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI), a series of damaging events is initiated that lead to cell death and overall dysfunction, which cause {{the formation of an}} irregularly-shaped lesion cavity. The resulting cavity causes many problems for tissue-engineered scaffolds because invasive implantation is required, and often the scaffold does not conform to the cavity shape. In order to get around these difficulties, thermo-responsive hydrogels have been engineered to undergo solution-gelation (sol-gel) transitions, which are caused by differences in room and physiological temperatures, to facilitate implantation through in situ <b>gelation</b> and conformation to cavity shape caused, allowing them to be injected in a minimally invasively manner.|$|E
25|$|Gelatin is {{a mixture}} of {{peptides}} and proteins produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen extracted from the skin, bones, and connective tissues of animals such as domesticated cattle, chicken, pigs, and fish. During hydrolysis, the natural molecular bonds between individual collagen strands are broken down into a form that rearranges more easily. Its chemical composition is, in many aspects, closely similar to that of its parent collagen. Photographic and pharmaceutical grades of gelatin generally are sourced from cattle bones and pig skin. Gelatin has proline, hydroxyproline and glycine in its polypeptide chain. Glycine is responsible for close packing of the chains. Presence of proline restricts the conformation. This is important for <b>gelation</b> properties of gelatin.|$|E
25|$|Cellular {{adhesion}} and development. The adhesion between {{cells is}} {{a characteristic of}} multicellular organisms that enables tissue specialization and therefore increases cell complexity. Adhesion of cell epithelia involves the actin cytoskeleton {{in each of the}} joined cells as well as cadherins acting as extracellular elements with the connection between the two mediated by catenins. Interfering in actin dynamics has repercussions for an organism’s development, in fact actin is such a crucial element that systems of redundant genes are available. For example, if the α-actinin or <b>gelation</b> factor gene has been removed in Dictyostelium individuals do not show an anomalous phenotype possibly {{due to the fact that}} each of the proteins can perform the function of the other. However, the development of double mutations that lack both gene types is affected.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} {{relaxation of}} a viscoelastic gel {{has been identified}} as primary mechanism responsible for densification and associated pore evolution in both colloidal and polymeric silica gels. Experiments in the viscoelastic properties of such skeletal networks on various time scales require a force varying with a period (or frequency) appropriate to the relaxation time of the phenomenon investigated, and inversely proportional to the distance over which such relaxation occurs. High frequencies associated with ultrasonic waves have been used extensively in the handling of polymer solutions, liquids and gels and the determination of their viscoelastic properties. Static measurements of the shear modulus have been made, as well as dynamic measurements of the speed of propagation of shear waves, which yields the dynamic modulus of rigidity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques have been utilized in order to monitor the dynamics of density fluctuations through the behavior of the autocorrelation function near the point of <b>gelation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Phase {{separation}} {{allows for}} three-dimensional sub-micrometre fiber scaffolds {{to be created}} {{without the use of}} specialized equipment. The five steps involved in phase separation are polymer dissolution, phase separation and <b>gelation,</b> solvent extraction from the gel, freezing and freeze drying in water. The final product is a continuous fiber network. Phase separation can be modified to fit many different applications, and pore structure can be varied by using different solvents, which can change the entire process from liquid–liquid to solid–liquid. Porosity and fiber diameter can also be modified by varying the initial concentration of the polymer; a higher initial concentration leads to less pores and larger fiber diameters. This technique can be used to create networks of fibers with diameters reaching type I collagen fiber diameters. The fibrous network created is randomly oriented and so far work has not been done to attempt to organize the fibers. Phase separation is a widely used technique for creating highly porous nanofibrous scaffolds with ease.|$|E
25|$|Methylcellulose (MC) is a {{material}} with well-defined sol-gel transitions in the optimal range of temperatures. MC <b>gelation</b> occurs {{because of an}} increase in intra- and inter-molecular hydrophobic interactions as the temperature increases. The sol-gel transition is governed by the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which is the temperature at which the elastic modulus equals the viscous modulus. The LCST must not exceed physiological temperature (37°C) if the scaffold is to gel upon implantation, creating a minimally invasive delivery. Following implantation into a TBI lesion cavity or peripheral nerve guidance conduit, MC elicits a minimal inflammatory response. It is also very important for minimally invasive delivery that the MC solution has a viscosity at temperatures below its LCST, which allows it to be injected through a small gauge needle for implantation in in vivo applications. MC has been successfully used as a delivery agent for intra-optical and oral pharmaceutical therapies. Some disadvantages of MC include its limited propensity for protein adsorption and neuronal cellular adhesion making it a non-bioactive hydrogel. Due to these disadvantages, use of MC in neural tissue regeneration requires attaching a biologically active group onto the polymer backbone in order to enhance cell adhesion.|$|E

Since precursors with multiple functional groups polymerize into networks of covalent C-C bonds (on average 85 kcal/mol), networks formed by self-assembly, which relies on secondary forces (generally less than 10 kcal/mol), are less stable., Theorists also have difficulties predicting characteristic <b>gelation</b> parameters, such as gel point and <b>gelation</b> time, {{with a single}} and simple equation.

An alternate approach is to promote self-assembly by triggering changes in intermolecular interactions, i.e. cis-trans isomerization, hydrogen bonding, donor-acceptor π-π stacking interaction, electrostatic interactions etc. Matsumoto et al. and Hirst et al. have reported <b>gelation</b> using light-induced isomerization and by incorporating additives into the system to influence molecular packing, respectively.|$|E

50|$|The {{homogenous}} polymer {{solution in}} {{the first step is}} thermodynamically unstable and tends to separate into polymer-rich and polymer-lean phases under appropriate temperature. Eventually after solvent removal, the polymer-rich phase solidifies to form the matrix and the polymer-lean phase develops into pores. Next, two types of phase separation can be carried out on the polymer solution depending on the desired pattern. Liquid-liquid separation is usually used to form bicontinuous phase structures while solid-liquid phase separation is used to form crystal structures. The <b>gelation</b> step plays a crucial role in controlling the porous morphology of the nanofibrous matrices. <b>Gelation</b> is influenced by temperature, polymer concentration, and solvent properties. Temperature regulates the structure of the fiber network: low <b>gelation</b> temperature results in formation of nanoscale fiber networks while high <b>gelation</b> temperature leads to the formation of a platelet-like structure. Polymer concentration affects fiber properties: an increase in polymer concentration decreases porosity and increases mechanical properties such as tensile strength. Solvent properties influence morphology of the scaffolds. After <b>gelation,</b> gel is placed in distilled water for solvent exchange. Afterwards, the gel is removed from the water and goes through freezing and freeze-drying. It is then stored in a desiccator until characterization.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gelation</b> {{occurs when}} a polymer forms large {{interconnected}} polymer molecules through cross-linking. In other words, polymer chains are cross-linked with other polymer chains to form an infinitely large molecule, interspersed with smaller complex molecules, shifting the polymer from a liquid to a network solid or gel phase.
