40|$|ABSTRACT: Stress {{functions}} for anisotropic plates, containing three holes and sub-jected to plane stress loading condition, were derived using complex variables and super-positioning the solutions {{of one and}} two hole plates. MacLaurin series expansion was {{used to calculate the}} stresses around the contour of the openings. Effects of openings ’ sizes, shapes, and relative positions on stress concentration factors were investigated. Results in-dicated that adjacent holes may be ignored if the distance between the center of the open-ings is at least five times the length of the major axis of the openings. Also, the stress con-centration factor (SCF) of a circular hole, located between the larger and a smaller hole, was affected more by the presence of the larger hole. For an <b>elliptical</b> <b>hole</b> located between an <b>elliptical</b> <b>hole</b> and a circular hole, the circular hole exerted more influence on the SCF of the <b>elliptical</b> <b>hole</b> when the plate was under vertical tension. Under biaxial tension, the other <b>elliptical</b> <b>hole</b> had greater influence on the SCF of the center <b>elliptical</b> <b>hole.</b> When the holes were arranged in triangular pattern, the SCF decreased as the angle between the holes increased.

40|$|Following Sih's {{approach}} to the rectilinearly anisotropic plane strain elasticity, the present work analytically studies the stress field, image force and shielding effect of an edge dislocation {{in the vicinity of}} an <b>elliptical</b> <b>hole.</b> The results show that the dislocation source plays a very important role in the interaction. The stress field and the image force are more pronounced for the edge dislocation emitted from the <b>elliptical</b> <b>hole</b> than that for the edge dislocation come elsewhere. Tungsten (W) single crystal is used to simulate an isotropically elastic material, and iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) to represent the anisotropic bcc, fee and hcp structures, respectively. The effects of anisotropy are the most pronounced on the stress component sigma(zz) among all stress components. When a dislocation is emitted from the hole and moves far away, the interaction between the dislocation and the hole behaves like that between the real dislocation and an image dislocation located {{at the center of the}} hole having the same Burgers vector but with an opposite sign as the real. However, there is no interaction at all between a dislocation and the hole if the dislocation come elsewhere is located far away from the hole. In general, the anisotropy produces an abnormal image force. When the dislocation is located on the x-axis and has a Burgers vector parallel to the x-axis, an abnormal image force is induced along the y-axis, while an abnormal image force is induced along the x-axis when the dislocation is located on the y-axis and has a Burgers vector parallel to the y-axis.
