40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the neutralization efficacy of a universal neutralizer proposed by the CTPA on a range of antimicrobial agents and its potential toxicity for microorganisms that are used for antimicrobial preservation testing. Several types of antimicrobial agents including a mixture of methylisothiazolinone and its 5 -chloro derivative, <b>dimethylol</b> <b>dimethyl</b> hydantoin, Quaternium- 15 ®, Bronopol®, benzalkonium chloride, phenoxyethanol, methyl and propyl paraben, chlorhexidine, imidazolidinyl urea, triclosan and thiomersal built-in pharmaceutical, cosmetic or health care products, as well as 6 types of these antimicrobials, i. e. a combination of methyl paraben (0. 18 % w/v) and propyl paraben (0. 02 %), imidazolidinyl urea (0. 3 %), chlorhexidine (0. 01 %), benzalkonium chloride (0. 02 %), Bronopol® (0. 1 %) and thiomersal (0. 02 %) in their pure and soluble form were tested. Validation of microbial recovery was carried out according to the US Pharmacopeia 27 guidelines. The universal neutralizer could inactivate all the studied antimicrobial agents against different strains tested except Staphylococcus aureus. With regards to this microorganism, only seven preservative chemicals consisting of parabens, <b>dimethylol</b> <b>dimethyl</b> hydantoin, Quaternium- 15 ®, Bronopol®, benzalkonium chloride, Phenonip® and imidazolidinyl urea were effectively inactivated. In addition, a pure solution of 0. 02 % thiomersal retained its antimicrobial properties against all studied microorganisms. The neutralizer solution showed no toxicity on any of the test organisms. In conclusion, CTPA proposed neutralizing solution is not an inclusive neutralizer. Moreover, each organism {{to be used in the}} test must be included in the validation study...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria {{from the}} Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) are {{encountered}} as industrial contaminants, and {{little is known}} about the species involved or their mechanisms of preservative resistance. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that multiple Bcc species may cause contamination, with B. lata (n = 17) and B. cenocepacia (n = 11) dominant within the collection examined. At the strain level, 11 of the 31 industrial sequence types identified had also been recovered from either natural environments or clinical infections. Minimal inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal (MBC) preservative concentrations varied across 83 selected Bcc strains, with industrial strains demonstrating increased tolerance for <b>dimethylol</b> <b>dimethyl</b> hydantoin (DMDMH). Benzisothiazolinone (BIT), DMDMH, methylisothiazolinone (MIT), a blend of 3 : 1 methylisothiazolinone-chloromethylisothiazolinone (M-CMIT), methyl paraben (MP), and phenoxyethanol (PH), were all effective anti-Bcc preservatives; benzethonium chloride (BC) and sodium benzoate (SB) were least effective. Since B. lata was the dominant industrial Bcc species, the type strain, 383 T (LMG 22485 T), was used to study preservative tolerance. Strain 383 developed stable preservative tolerance for M-CMIT, MIT, BIT, and BC, which resulted in preservative cross-resistance and altered antibiotic susceptibility, motility, and biofilm formation. Transcriptomic analysis of the B. lata 383 M-CMIT-adapted strain demonstrated that efflux played a key role in its M-CMIT tolerance and elevated fluoroquinolone resistance. The role of efflux was corroborated using the inhibitor l-Phe-Arg-β-napthylamide, which reduced the MICs of M-CMIT and ciprofloxacin. In summary, intrinsic preservative tolerance and stable adaptive changes, such as enhanced efflux, play a role in the ability of Bcc bacteria to cause industrial contamination...|$|E
40|$|P. aeruginosa is a {{versatile}} microorganism {{with high levels}} of antimicrobial resistance and a common contaminant of home and personal care (HPC) products. Relatively little is known about P. aeruginosa in industrial settings and to further investigate this, four areas were considered: (i) culture-dependent and –independent detection of P. aeruginosa; (ii) P. aeruginosa and bacterial diversity in HPC products; (iii) preservative susceptibility and phenotypic characterisation of industrial P. aeruginosa strains, and; (iv) P. aeruginosa adaptation to a preservative combination. A large collection of P. aeruginosa and non-P. aeruginosa industrial isolates was utilised to evaluate five selective agars for the detection of P. aeruginosa. Media using negative selection performed best overall, but media using positive selection had potential as enrichment media. Culture-independent detection of P. aeruginosa and overall bacterial diversity was achieved via direct DNA extraction from contaminated HPC products, species specific PCRs and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. The bacterial diversity in HPC products was low, with less than three contaminating genera in each product. The diversity of P. aeruginosa strains from industrial, clinical and environmental sources was investigated using five genotyping techniques, ranging from PCR-fingerprinting methods to whole genome sequencing, and phenotypic assays examining preservative susceptibility, growth dynamics and motility. P. aeruginosa strain diversity was high and there was no association between genotype, phenotype and isolation source. The development of adaptive resistance of P. aeruginosa to a preservative combination used in HPC products was modelled using planktonic growth and biofilm assays. P. aeruginosa PA 14 grew in elevated levels of the preservatives chloromethylisothiazolinone, methylisothiazolinone and <b>dimethylol</b> <b>dimethyl</b> hydantoin but it was unknown whether the increased tolerance was stable. Whilst eradication of P. aeruginosa from the industrial environment is unlikely, improved detection methods and understanding of the species will inform industrial practices and preservative formulations to minimise HPC product contamination...|$|E
