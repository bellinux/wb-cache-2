40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the results obtained from density measurements of pure water produced at CENAM. This water is used as <b>density</b> <b>standard</b> for calibrations services. The measurements were done into a scheme of experimental design {{in order to find}} possible sources of variability in the hydrostatic weighing system of the national <b>density</b> <b>standard.</b> The design factors checked were: days after the water is produced, positions of the solid density standards at the hydrostatic weighing system and the spheres used. The variable of interest for the scheme of experimental design was the difference between the water density measured using the solid density standards and the water density calculated by the formula of M. Tanaka et al. [1].

For the mass concentration, whatever the density considered, the ELPI-determined value {{was close to the}} reference. For the number concentration, results indicate good agreement between SMPS and ELPI number concentrations when considering effective density and, to a lesser extent, average effective density. In contrast, with the raw material <b>density</b> or <b>standard</b> <b>density,</b> large uncertainties in number concentration measurements were produced. A good estimation of number concentration was obtained based on ELPI data when assuming a <b>standard</b> <b>density</b> only when there was fortuitous agreement between the number tested aerosol size distribution and its mobility-dependent effective density.

40|$|The Powder River Basin of Wyoming is a {{semi-arid}} area dominated by sagebrush grassland vegetation communities. This region includes 15 surface coal mines. Reclamation of mined lands requires re-establishment of native species {{to meet the}} post mine land use. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) serves as the regulatory authority for the State’s surface coal mines. Wyoming statutes require that the disturbance from surface coal mining activities be reclaimed to a condition at least equal to the pre-mine condition.

40|$|We {{study how}} the {{estimation}} of the sonic Mach number (M_s) from ^ 13 CO linewidths relates to the actual 3 D sonic Mach number. For this purpose we analyze MHD simulations which include post-processing to take radiative transfer effects into account. As expected, we find very good agreement between the linewidth estimated sonic Mach number and the actual sonic Mach number of the simulations for optically thin tracers. However, we find that opacity broadening causes M_s to be overestimated {{by a factor of}} 1. 16 - 1. 3 when calculated from optically thick ^ 13 CO lines. We also find that there is a dependency on the magnetic field: super-Alfvénic turbulence shows increased line broadening as compared with sub-Alfvénic turbulence for all values of optical depth for supersonic turbulence. Our results have implications for the observationally derived sonic Mach number [...] <b>density</b> <b>standard</b> deviation (σ_ρ/) relationship, σ^ 2 _ρ/ =b^ 2 M_s^ 2, and the related column <b>density</b> <b>standard</b> deviation (σ_N/) sonic Mach number relationship. In particular, we find that the parameter b, as an indicator of solenoidal vs. compressive driving, will be underestimated as a result of opacity broadening. We compare the σ_N/ -M_s relation derived from synthetic dust extinction maps and ^ 13 CO linewidths with recent observational studies and find that solenoidally driven MHD turbulence simulations have values of σ_N/ which are lower than real molecular clouds. This {{may be due to the}} influence of self-gravity which should be included in simulations of molecular cloud dynamics. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, accepted on ApJ...|$|E
