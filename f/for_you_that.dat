500|$|... (It is good <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I leave), BWV108, is {{a church}} cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He {{composed}} it in Leipzig for Cantate Sunday, the fourth Sunday after Easter, and first performed it on 29 April 1725.|$|E
500|$|The {{similarities}} {{begin with}} the first movement, which {{like that of the}} previous year´s cantata, is given to the bass as the vox Christi. The movement is the quotation of verse 7 from the gospel, beginning: [...] "" [...] (It is good <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I leave; for if I did not go, the Comforter would not come to you.) It is between aria and arioso. An oboe d'amore as the obbligato instrument plays extended melodies. Voice and oboe share the musical material, conveying [...] "the mood of grieving at parting".|$|E
500|$|The opening movement, [...] "" [...] (Behold, I {{will send}} out many fishers), {{is given to}} the bass solo, {{possibly}} because Jeremiah has God speak in the first person. The music follows the text in two sections, as in a motet. Probably therefore Bach avoided the title aria and wrote [...] instead. Some cantatas on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler from the second annual cycle begin in a similar way with a bible quotation, of Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (I am a Good Shepherd, BWV 85), [...] "" [...] (It is good <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I leave, BWV 108), and Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (Until now you have asked for nothing in My name, BWV 87).|$|E

500|$|It {{was then}} an annual custom for the Pope {{to receive a}} {{delegation}} from Rome's Jewish community shortly after the New Year. The meeting on 2 February 1859 quickly descended into a heated argument, with Pope Pius berating the Jewish visitors for [...] "stirring up a storm all over Europe about this Mortara case". When the delegation denied that the Jews of Rome had had any hand in the anti-clerical articles, the Pope dismissed Scazzocchio as inexperienced and foolish, then shouted: [...] "The newspapers can write all they want. I couldn't care less what the world thinks!" [...] The Pope then calmed down somewhat: [...] "So strong is the pity I have <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> I pardon you, indeed, I must pardon you." [...] One of the delegates proposed that the Church should not give so much credence to Morisi's testimony, given her spurious morals—the Pope countered that regardless of her character, so {{far as he could}} see the servant had no reason to invent such a story, and in any case Momolo Mortara should not have employed a Catholic in the first place.|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} average {{reviews from}} critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "The ratio of bad to good episodes was not too favorable in this season of Family Guy. Far too many episodes were either seriously lacking in humor or were just plain poorly written", but added, [...] "While much of the original appeal seems to have washed-off, {{there are still a}} few moments from this season that really stand out", listing [...] "Chick Cancer", [...] "Road to Rupert", [...] "Saving Private Brian", and [...] "No Meals on Wheels" [...] as the best episodes of the season. Haque also gave praise to [...] "Blind Ambition", [...] "No Chris Left Behind", [...] "Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey", and [...] "Meet the Quagmires". Manisha Kanetkar of Smart House, however, felt that the series saw [...] "no sign of tiring" [...] and had [...] "as many funny moments as ever." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com regarded [...] "Airport '07", [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", and [...] "Barely Legal" [...] as [...] "gem episodes." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume five DVD, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk said [...] "There are several points to criticize {{when it comes to this}} set, including a series that's losing some of its steam and relying on comedic crutches and an oddly constructed episode structure, but in the end, the series is fun to watch, which is all you really ask for from a cartoon sitcom." [...] In a later review, Rizzo added [...] "Is Family Guy coasting on it's [...] past successes? It could be argued, as the series doesn't surprise or shock the way it once did, instead doing the things that have worked before and doing them more and larger. The DVD releases are predictable and consistent, with high quality and impressive rafts of bonus material, but if the show doesn't do it <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> doesn't make much of a difference." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{proof of}} Sheldon having feelings for Amy {{is given in}} the season 8 episode [...] "The Prom Equivalency", when he finally admits being in love with her: [...] "I love you too. There's no denying I have feelings <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love." ...|$|E

2500|$|Khomeini did {{not give}} a legal {{reasoning}} for his judgement. [...] It {{is thought to be}} based on the ninth chapter of the Qur'an, called At-Tawba, verse 61: [...] "Some of them hurt the prophet by saying, 'He is all ears!' Say, 'It is better <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> he listens to you. He believes in God, and trusts the believers. He is a mercy for those among you who believe.' Those who hurt God's messenger have incurred a painful retribution".|$|E

2500|$|The Persian slave Piruz Nahavandi (also {{known as}} Abu Lulu) brought a {{complaint}} to Umar {{about the high}} tax charged by his master Mughirah. Umar wrote to Mughirah and inquired about the tax; Mughirah's reply was satisfactory, but Umar held that the tax charged to Abu Lulu was reasonable, owing to his daily income. Umar then {{is reported to have}} asked Abu Lulu: [...] "I heard that you make windmills; make one for me as well." [...] In a sullen mood, Piruz said, [...] "Verily I will make such a mill <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> the whole world would remember it".|$|E

2500|$|When Dammeier {{argued for}} the respondents, Ginsburg and Breyer pressed him on why it was {{unreasonable}} for the department to review {{the content of the}} messages if it wanted to find out if it needed a higher character limit. The lawyer reiterated the jury's finding and said [...] "they didn't need to do that". In response to further questioning from Breyer, he restated the other ways Judge Wardlaw had suggested the department could have obtained the information without reviewing the messages themselves. Justice Sotomayor was skeptical. [...] "You're relying on the very person you're auditing to do the audit <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> <b>That</b> doesn't seem either practical or business-wise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Norwood {{noted the}} song [...] "a Brandy song" [...] and [...] "reconnect" [...] with Jerkins: [...] "Our {{experience}} this {{time has been}} very magical," [...] she said about collaboration with Jerkins.

Like the new version of who we are [...]" [...] Lyrically, [...] "Departed" [...] chronicle a woman's talks about mutual support with loved ones. Recorded with therapeutical background, Norwood has noted the fatal 2006 car accident, in which she was involved, as a reason for its inclusion on the album. [...] "To know that you have somebody by your side who is gonna always be there <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> comforts you in a way and that kinda gives you an extra confidence about yourself," [...] she said, [...] "And that's what I love about it: It's first the message and than you get into the beat and the whole musical part of it. I think everyone's gonna be able to relate to that [...] It's universal." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Figo {{returned}} to Barcelona {{for the first}} time in a Real Madrid shirt on 21 October 2000, the noise at Camp Nou was deafening. There were banners hung around the stadium with words like [...] "Traitor", [...] "Judas", [...] "Scum", and [...] "Mercenary". Figo was mercilessly taunted throughout, and when he came out of the tunnel and ran onto the field the jeers of almost 98,000 Barcelona fans escalated, with a visibly shocked Figo putting his fingers to his ears. When El Clásico started, each time Figo got the ball the noise rose with insults and missiles flying such as oranges, bottles, cigarette lighters and mobile phones. The regular corner taker for Madrid, Figo did not take any corners at the Camp Nou to avoid being in close proximity to the fans. Barcelona were victorious, winning 2–0, and Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez stated after the match, [...] "The atmosphere got to us all." [...] Madrid defender Iván Campo commented, [...] "That night when Figo first went back was incredible. I’ve never heard anything like it. Luís didn't deserve that. He'd given his all for Barcelona. It was built up before: 'a traitor’s coming,' the media said. No, Luís Figo is coming, one of the greats <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> <b>That</b> night hurt him, you could see. His head was bowed and he was thinking: 'bloody hell, I was here last season ...' But my lasting emotion was admiration: you’ve got balls." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stanford center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd {{been reading}} about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among {{ourselves}} that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us." [...] In his first address to the team, Shaughnessy told them, [...] "Boys, I am not to be addressed as 'Clark' or, especially, [...] 'Soup'. To you, I am 'Mr. Shaughnessy' or 'Coach.' Nothing else. I am a professor of football... Now, I have a formation <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> if you learn it well {{will take you to}} the Rose Bowl." [...] He asserted that one of his plays, a line plunge by a back without a blocker, would score ten to twelve touchdowns alone, which was more than the Indians had scored the entire previous season. The players were understandably skeptical, and they were not alone. Football innovator and single-wing proponent Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner said before the season, [...] "If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, you can throw all the football I ever knew into the Pacific Ocean." [...] Shaughnessy later discovered that the players, who were mostly returners from the 1939 team, were talented, but not suited to the single wing. As a contemporary newspaper noted, [...] "The [...] team looked great in some games and sour in others. The machinery was there but it wasn't running as smoothly as had been hoped for." ...|$|E
60|$|Therefore be not {{anxious about}} the morrow.
