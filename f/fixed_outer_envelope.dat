The insertion of OEP 7 into the membrane is independent of outer membrane channel proteins and can be reconstituted {{with the use of}} protein-free liposomes. In situ, the binding of OEP 7 to the membrane surface is not driven by electrostatic interaction because reduction of phosphatidylglycerol or phosphatidylinositol did not reduce the association with the liposomes.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus on the extent of phospholipid hydrolysis in envelope membrane vesicles and in intact chloroplasts. When isolated envelope vesicles were incubated in presence of phospholipase C, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol, but not phosphatidylinositol, were totally converted into diacylglycerol if they were available to the enzyme (i. e., when the vesicles were sonicated in presence of phospholipase C). These experiments demonstrate that phospholipase C can be used to probe the availability of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol in the cytosolic leaflet of the <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> membrane from spinach chloroplasts. When isolated, purified, intact chloroplasts were incubated with low amounts of phospholipase C (0. 3 U/mg chlorophyll) under very mild conditions (12 degrees C for 1 min), greater than 80 % of phosphatidylcholine molecules and almost none of phosphatidylglycerol molecules were hydrolyzed. Since we have also demonstrated, by using several different methods (phase-contrast and electron microscopy, immunochemical and electrophoretic analyses) that isolated spinach chloroplasts, and especially their <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> membrane, remained intact after mild treatment with phospholipase C, we can conclude that there is a marked asymmetric distribution of phospholipids across the <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> membrane of spinach chloroplasts. Phosphatidylcholine, the major polar lipid of the <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> membrane, is almost entirely accessible from the cytosolic side of the membrane and therefore is probably localized in the outer leaflet of the <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> bilayer. On the contrary, phosphatidylglycerol, the major polar lipid in the inner envelope membrane and the thylakoids, is probably not accessible to phospholipase C from the cytosol and therefore is probably localized mostly in the inner leaflet of the <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> membrane and in the other chloroplast membranes...|$|R
40|$|Two {{envelope}} membranes delimit plastids, {{the defining}} organelles of plant cells. The inner and <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> membranes are unique in their protein and lipid composition. Several studies {{have attempted to}} establish the proteome of these two membranes; however, differentiating between them is difficult due to their close proximity. Here, we describe a novel approach to distinguish the localization of proteins between the two membranes using a straightforward approach based on live cell imaging coupled with transient expression. We base our approach on analyses {{of the distribution of}} GFP-fusions, which were aimed to verify <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> membrane proteomics data. To distinguish between <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> and inner envelope protein localization, we used AtTOC 64 –GFP and AtTIC 40 –GFP, as respective controls. During our analyses, we observed membrane proliferations and loss of chloroplast shape in conditions of protein over-expression. The morphology of the proliferations varied in correlation with the suborganellar distribution of the over-expressed proteins. In particular, while layers of membranes built up in the inner <b>envelope</b> membrane, the <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> formed long extensions into the cytosol. Using electron microscopy, we showed that these extensions were stromules, a dynamic feature of plastids. Since the behavior of the membranes is different and is related to the protein localization, we propose that in vivo studies based on the analysis of morphological differences of the membranes can be used to distinguish between inner and <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> localizations of proteins. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach, we demonstrated the localization of AtLACS 9 to the <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> membrane.

Bacteriol. 88 : 1087 – 1103. 1964. —The ultrastructure of axial fibrils and <b>outer</b> <b>envelopes</b> {{of a number}} of oral spirochetes was studied in thin sections and by negative contrast. The axial fibrils measured 150 to 200 A in diameter. Only one end of each fibril was inserted subterminally into the protoplasmic cylinder by means of a 400 A wide disc. The free ends of fibrils inserted near one end of the cylinder extended toward, and overlapped in close apposition, the free ends of fibrils inserted at the other end. In thin sections, some axial fibrils showed a substructure, suggestive of a dense central core.

40|$|Background: Tail-anchored (TA) {{proteins}} are {{a distinct}} class of membrane proteins that are sorted post-translationally to various organelles and {{function in a}} number of important cellular processes, including redox reactions, vesicular trafficking and protein translocation. While the molecular targeting signals and pathways responsible for sorting TA proteins to their correct intracellular destinations in yeasts and mammals have begun to be characterized, relatively little is known about TA protein biogenesis in plant cells, especially for those sorted to the plastid <b>outer</b> <b>envelope.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we investigated the biogenesis of three plastid TA proteins, including the 33 -kDa and 34 -kDa GTPases of the translocon at the <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> of chloroplasts (Toc 33 and Toc 34) and a novel 9 -kDa protein of unknown function that we define here as an <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> TA protein (OEP 9). Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro assays we show that OEP 9 utilizes a different sorting pathway than that used by Toc 33 and Toc 34. For instance, while all three TA proteins interact with the cytosolic OEP chaperone/receptor, AKR 2 A, the plastid targeting information within OEP 9 is distinct from that within Toc 33 and Toc 34. Toc 33 and Toc 34 also appear to differ from OEP 9 in that their insertion is dependent on themselves and the unique lipid composition of the plastid <b>outer</b> <b>envelope.</b> By contrast, the insertion of OEP 9 into the plastid <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> occurs in a proteinaceous-dependent, but Toc 33 / 34 -independent manner and membrane lipids appear to serve primarily to facilitate normal thermodynamic integration of this TA protein. Conclusions/Significance: Collectively, the results provide evidence in support of at least two sorting pathways for plastid TA <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> proteins and shed light on not only the complex diversity of pathways involved in the targeting and insertion of proteins into plastids, but also the molecular mechanisms that underlie the delivery of TA proteins to their proper intracellular locations in general...|$|R
40|$|Chloroplasts, unique organelles of plants, {{originated}} from endosymbiosis of an ancestor of today's cyanobacteria with a mitochondria-containing host cell. It {{is assumed that}} the <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> membrane, which delimits the chloroplast from the surrounding cytosol, was thus inherited from its Gram-negative bacterial ancestor. This plastid-specific membrane is thus equipped with elements of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin. In particular, the membrane-intrinsic <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> proteins (OEPs) form solute channels with properties reminiscent of porins and channels in the bacterial outer membrane. OEP channels are characterised by distinct specificities for metabolites and a quite peculiar expression pattern in specialised plant organs and plastids, thus disproving {{the assumption that the}} <b>outer</b> <b>envelope</b> is a non-specific molecular sieve.

Although most of the OEP channels are formed by P-strands as well, phylogeny based on sequence homology alone is not feasible.
