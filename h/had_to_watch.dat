5|$|In June the {{battalion}} {{was placed in}} reserve as a ready-reinforcement unit and consequently saw little combat. From July to September, 3rd Battalion operated all throughout the I Corps area of operations, moving its command post to ten different locations. Hundreds of Marines were also affected by cellulitis. Following President Johnson's halt of the US bombing campaign on 1 November, 3rd Battalion Marines <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> as the PAVN brazenly pushed large convoys of men and munitions south along the Ben Hai River. In one instance it took three days for {{the battalion}} to get approval for a single airstrike on a North Vietnamese convoy.|$|E

5|$|The warfare {{with the}} Prussians relied on guerilla raids {{in the border}} regions. Small groups of men, a dozen to a hundred, made quick raids on farms, villages, border posts, etc. This was a {{positional}} warfare where neither side could defeat the other, but the Teutonic Knights relied on future reinforcements from Germany and Europe, while Prussians were draining their local resources. After the massacre of surrendered Teutonic soldiers in the Battle of Krücken in 1249, the Knights refused {{to negotiate with the}} Prussians. The Prussians were also unable to coordinate their efforts and develop a common strategy: while each clan had its own leader, {{there was no one to}} lead all the clans. The Natangians <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> for attacks from Balga, Brandenburg, Wehlau, and Königsberg while the Warmians were threatened by garrisons at Christburg and Elbing. This way only Diwane and his Bartians were able to continue the war in the west. They made several minor expeditions to Culmerland each year.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi {{competed in}} three events. He won the 10,000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting past {{him on the}} home straight. Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his {{qualifying}} heat for the 3000 m steeplechase. He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot. Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne gracefully refused. In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> his teammate pull away instead. Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver. Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day. Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland's steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance. On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi's time also bettered the previous record. Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.|$|E
5|$|In the {{build up}} to the World Cup Charlton gave out first caps to Gary Kelly, Phil Babb and Jason McAteer; he had {{difficulty}} convincing McAteer to join Ireland as he first had to turn down an approach by the FA {{to play for the}} England under-21s. He scheduled difficult matches before the tournament and Ireland picked up positive results by beating both the Netherlands and Germany away from home. Ireland opened the group stage of the tournament by beating Italy 1–0 at the Giants Stadium, Ray Houghton scoring the winning goal on 11 minutes. They then fell to a 2–1 defeat to Mexico at the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium, during which Charlton had a pitch-side argument with an official who was preventing substitute John Aldridge (who went on to score the consolation goal) from taking the pitch minutes after his teammate Tommy Coyne had left the pitch {{and sat down on the}} bench. For his arguing, Charlton was suspended by FIFA for the final group game against Norway, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> from the commentary box as Ireland qualified with a 0–0 draw. They faced the Netherlands in the Round of 16; Dennis Bergkamp put the Dutch ahead on 11 minutes after Marc Overmars took advantage of a mistake by Terry Phelan, and Wim Jonk scored the second and final goal of the game from 30 yards after Packie Bonner fluffed an otherwise routine save. For his achievements Charlton was awarded the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1994 by Lord Mayor Tomás Mac Giolla, the first Englishman to be given the honour since 1854.|$|E

5|$|The Bears {{returned}} from the bye week by hosting the 4–2 Minnesota Vikings. In their rivalry, the Vikings led the all-time series 55–51–2, the Vikings winning the last game 13–9, though the Vikings had not beaten the Bears at Soldier Field since 2007. Jeff Joniak wrote that the offense had to protect Jay Cutler; the Vikings defense sacked Matthew Stafford seven times in week seven, {{with a total of}} 17 in 2015. In eleven career games against Minnesota, Cutler excelled, throwing 23 touchdowns and 13 interceptions, with an 8-3 record. A player that Joniak believed Cutler could attack is cornerback Xavier Rhodes, who allowed four passing touchdowns and a league-worst ten penalties. Additionally, the running backs could target a defense that allowed six yards per carry, one of the worst in the NFL. On defense, the Bears <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> for Adrian Peterson, who averaged 88 rushing yards per game, including two consecutive games with at least 120 yards in each. Another player was quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, who completed 25 passes to eleven players in week seven, while watching for the speed of the Minnesota receiving corps. Despite such successes, as a whole, the Vikings offense was averaging 325.5 yards per game, the third-least in the league. In the red zone, the Vikings scored touchdowns on 42.11 percent of their drives, among the worst in the NFL. Terrance Mitchell, Shea McClellin, Hroniss Grasu, Jermon Bushrod, Bruce Gaston, Ka'Deem Carey and Cameron Meredith were inactive.|$|E
5|$|The Bears' first away game of {{the season}} {{occurred}} in Seattle, who led the all-time series 10–6, including the last three regular season games. However, the Bears had won the last game in Seattle in 2009 25–19. The Bears offense, not featuring Jay Cutler nor Alshon Jeffery, faced a defense led by Kam Chancellor, who returned to the Seahawks after a holdout. Without Chancellor for the first two games of the season, the defense had allowed quarterbacks to complete 72 percent of their passes with a passer rating of 116.4. Jeff Joniak believed that to counter the Legion of Boom, the Bears had to balance the rushing and passing attacks, while watching for a blitz that pressured Aaron Rodgers 19 times in week two. On defense, the Bears <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> for quarterback Russell Wilson, though he had struggled with pressure in the first two games, being sacked a total of eight times. Additionally, the run defense had to be aware of a running game led by Marshawn Lynch; the corps had averaged 121.5 yards per game. On special teams, the Bears had to stop speedy rookie receiver Tyler Lockett, who had scored on a punt return earlier in the season.|$|E

25|$|British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston urged {{a policy}} of neutrality. His {{international}} concerns were centered in Europe, where he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> both Napoleon III's ambitions in Europe and Bismarck's rise in Prussia. During the Civil War, British reactions to American events were shaped by past British policies and their own national interests, both strategically and economically. In the Western Hemisphere, as relations with the United States improved, Britain had become cautious about confronting the United States over issues in Central America.|$|E
25|$|When Cobden began what {{proved to}} be the final over, the score was still 175/7, with four runs needed to win. From the first ball, F.H. Hill played a shot which seemed sure to reach the {{boundary}} and thus to win the match. However it was brilliantly fielded and the batsmen could only run one. Hill then <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the tail-enders try to cope with Cobden in poor light. S.E. Butler was caught off the second ball of the over and T.H. Belcher was bowled by the third. With four ball overs at that time, Cobden had one ball left. If the batsman, W.A. Stewart, could survive it, then Hill would face the next over and would probably see Oxford home. But Cobden made no mistake and Stewart was bowled. Cobden finished with figures of 4/35, and 8/76 in the match.|$|E

Also {{a part of the}} VIII. corps (the garrison of Komárom) arrived in Csallóköz to support the attack. The II. corps had to attack again Királyrév and Zsigárd, the III. corps had to support them after crossing the Vág at Negyed, following the II. corps towards Zsigárd. The I. corps under the lead of General József Nagysándor had to make demonstration movements before Sempte, and if the conditions allowed it, had to start a real attack. The detachment of Colonel Horváth <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the road towards Nyitra, to advance, and demonstrate towards Galgóc. Klapka with the detached units of the VIII. corps had to protect the bridge from Aszódpuszta, and to assure the retreat way of the II. corps.|$|E

25|$|It was Fala, my husband's little dog, {{who never}} really readjusted. Once, in 1945, when General Eisenhower came {{to lay a}} wreath on Franklin's grave, {{the gates of the}} regular {{driveway}} were opened and his automobile approached the house accompanied by the wailing of the sirens of a police escort. When Fala heard the sirens, his legs straightened out, his ears pricked up and I knew that he expected to see his master coming down the drive as he had come so many times. Later, when we were living in the cottage, Fala always lay near the dining-room door where he could watch both entrances just as he did when his master was there. Franklin would often decide suddenly to go somewhere and Fala <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> both entrances in order to be ready to spring up and join the party on short notice. Fala accepted me after my husband's death, but I was just someone to put up with until the master should return.|$|E
25|$|El Paso was {{the largest}} city in the United States without a PBS {{television}} station within the city limits until 1978. El Paso viewers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> channel 22, KRWG, from Las Cruces until 1978. In fact, the city had only three English-speaking channels and two Spanish-language channels (channel 2 and channel 5) from Juarez, and cable TV subscribers in the 1970s and 1980s could receive four Los Angeles independent channels: KTLA, KHJ, KTTV and KCOP as well as Spanish-language stations KMEX of Los Angeles and KWEX of San Antonio usually sharing the same cable channel slot. Over time, as more television stations signed on, more cable channels were added and those stations added network affiliations, the L.A. and San Antonio stations would disappear from the lineup. The last to be removed was KTLA {{in the fall of}} 2006 {{as a consequence of the}} WB-UPN merger into The CW, when KVIA-TV launched a digital subchannel with the network's programming.|$|E
25|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} emperor, who had ceased his policy of grants and family alliances {{in favour of}} paying Magyar mercenaries, several Italian nobles — led by Adalbert {{and many of the}} bishops — invited Rudolph II of Upper Burgundy to take the Italian throne in 921. Moreover, his own grandson, Berengar of Ivrea, rose up against him, incited by Rudolph. Berengar retreated to Verona and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> sidelined as the Magyars pillaged the country. John, Bishop of Pavia, {{surrendered}} his city to Rudolph in 922 and it was sacked by the Magyars in 924. On 29 July 923, the forces of Rudolph, Adalbert, and Berengar of Ivrea met those of Berengar and defeated him in the Battle of Fiorenzuola, near Piacenza. The battle was decisive and Berengar was de facto dethroned and replaced by Rudolf. Berengar was soon after murdered at Verona by one of his own men, possibly at Rudolph's instigation. He left no sons, only a daughter (the aforementioned Bertha) and an anonymous epic poem, the Gesta Berengarii Imperatoris, about the many happenings of his troublesome reign.|$|E

25|$|The feeding {{was done}} {{through the use}} of specially-constructed small wooden boxes, 4cm by 7cm, {{developed}} by Weigl. The boxes were sealed with paraffin on the top which prevented the lice from escaping, and the underside consisted of a screen made of a fabric sieve, adopted by Weigl from sieves that were used by local peasants to separate wheat husks from the seeds. A typical box contained 400 to 800 lice larvae which would mature as the feeding took place. The sieve bottom allowed the lice to stick out their heads and feed on the human flesh. A standard feeding period took thirty to forty-five minutes, and was repeated with the same lice colony for twelve days. Usually, an individual feeder would accommodate from 7 to 11 boxes (of 400 to 800 lice each) on his or her leg, per feeding session. Typically men would place the boxes on their calves, to minimize the discomfort of the bites, while women feeders placed them on their thighs, so that the bite marks could be covered up by a skirt. A nurse <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over the feeding process as the lice would feed beyond the point of being gorged on the blood and could burst if left on the human flesh for too long.|$|E
25|$|Powell {{was next}} slated {{to run the}} Aviva London Grand Prix, however he pulled out, citing a groin strain. Later in late August, {{just a couple of}} days before the start of the World Championships in Daegu, Powell shocked the world by pulling out of the highly {{anticipated}} 100m as his groin strain aggravated and did not allow him to compete. Powell expressed great disappoinment but vowed to come back strong for the London Olympics in 2012, but still hoped to run the 4x100m relay in Daegu. However, he was unfit to run the relay and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> his compatriots win gold in a world record time of 37.04s. Powell competed in the 100m at the Diamond League Final in Zurich on 9 September. He looked very impressive in the first 60m, but faded to second place as newly crowned world champion, Yohan Blake, took victory in 9.82s. Powell registered a 9.95s run, which was impressive given the fact that his injury was still present. By completing the race, the sprinter took the Samsung Diamond Trophy with $40,000 in cash. Powell ended his season with another injury, almost a repeat of year 2010, where he showed excellent form in the first half of the year, but unfortunately suffered injuries.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{started their}} {{response}} quickly, but the reintroduction of Broad paid dividends for England {{when he got}} the wicket of Ronchi in the sixth over. It was Guptill who England <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> out for, however, following his performances earlier in the series, but it was another newcomer to the England side, Tredwell, who put paid to the New Zealand opener's plans of going the entire series without getting out, bowling him with his fifth ball of the match for 38. Williamson (19) was next to go, trapped plumb LBW by Root for his first ODI wicket. Bresnan then got Munro for a golden duck, before Tredwell had McCullum caught behind for 6, and Franklin edged Broad to gully for 7. Taylor and Nathan McCullum managed to put on a 53-run partnership for the seventh wicket before Broad caught McCullum off the bowling of Bresnan. Three overs later, Finn had Southee for 15 and the contest was all but over; Taylor was still in, two runs away from his half-century, but with 92 runs still to get in 12 overs and only two wickets in hand, the task was too much for New Zealand. Taylor gave it his best shot, though, making it to 71 before holing out to Bresnan off the bowling of Tredwell, and Mills added 28 runs of his own, but McClenaghan was unable to hold his own end up for long and New Zealand were bowled out for 253, 35 runs from victory.|$|E
