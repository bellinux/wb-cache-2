5|$|Casey's initial {{need was}} for {{engineer}} units {{to accomplish the}} daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of tractors, <b>graders,</b> concrete mixers and welding equipment. In {{the absence of a}} proper stock control system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke.

Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.|$|E

Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E

The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road <b>graders,</b> three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network.

The fee is not a toll charged to drive on the road, but rather an entry fee for the park itself. Various passes allow for admission to the park. A $25.00 pass is valid for unlimited entrances within a seven-day period for a private non-commercial vehicle. A seven-day pass costs $15.00 for motorcycles and $10.00 for individuals 16 {{years of age or}} older entering by means other than a private non-commercial vehicle. Commercial tours pay between $25.00 and $200.00 for a seven-day pass, depending on the number of passengers. An annual park pass costs $50.00 for a private non-commercial vehicle. Entrance can also be gained through the America the Beautiful: National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass series. In this series, the Annual Pass costs $80.00, the lifetime Senior Pass costs $10.00, the lifetime Access Pass allows free admission for persons with disabilities, and the Volunteer Pass allows free admission for volunteers who work 250 service hours for the following year.

40|$|This {{review of}} <b>grader</b> grass (Themeda quadrivalvis) {{attempts}} to collate current knowledge and identify knowledge gaps that may require further research. <b>Grader</b> grass is a tropical annual grass native to India {{that is now}} spread throughout many of the tropical regions of the world. In Australia, it has spread rapidly since its introduction in the 1930 s and is now naturalised in the tropical areas of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia and extends south along the east coast to northern New South Wales. It is a vigorous grass with limited palatability, {{that is capable of}} invading native and improved pastures, cropping land and protected areas such as state and national parks. <b>Grader</b> grass can form dense monocultures that reduce biodiversity, decrease animal productivity and increase the fire hazard in the seasonally dry tropics. Control options are based on herbicides, grazing management and slashing, while overgrazing appears to favour <b>grader</b> grass. The effect of fire on <b>grader</b> grass is inconclusive and needs to be defined. Little is known about the biology and impacts of <b>grader</b> grass in agricultural and protected ecosystems in Australia. In particular, information is needed on soil seed bank longevity, seed production, germination and growth, which would allow the development of management strategies to control this weedy grass...|$|R
40|$|One of {{important}} coffee beans quality {{is the size}} uniformity. To confirm with the standart requirement, coffee beans have to be graded before being traded. Until now, grading process is still carried out fully manual, so that the grading cost is very expensive about 40 % of total processing cost. Meanwhile, shortage of skill workers is as a limiting factor of the process. Therefore, machine for grading coffee beans is good alternative for grading cost. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed a table vibration type coffee grading machine for grouping of coffee beans in order to consistent quality and reduce grading cost. The machine has dimension of 272 cm length, 126 cm height, and 144 cm width. The machine has three primary components, i. e. <b>grader</b> table, combustion engine, and beam. The machine has three kinds of <b>grader</b> table that each <b>grader</b> table has different holes size, i. e. 7 mm x 7 mm for top <b>grader</b> table, 5 mm x 5 mm for axle <b>grader</b> table, and 4 mm x 4 mm for bottom <b>grader</b> table. Each <b>grader</b> table has dimension of 206 cm length, 105. 5 cm height, and 14 cm width. The grading mechanism is by vibration <b>grader</b> table with the power source 5. 5 HP combustion engine. The results shown that the outlet are in farms of three grades of coffee beans with connected to each compartement. Assessment of the grading machine reveals that the optimum capacity of 1, 406 kg/hour reached when the speed 2, 600 rpm and the angle 10 O.

40|$|To {{improve the}} fuel {{consumption}} of a motor <b>grader,</b> {{a method for}} shifting the power curve of the <b>grader</b> engine is proposed. The working principle, calculation method, and design procedure of the novel method are depicted. Considering the nonlinear and time-varying uncertainty of the load of a motor <b>grader,</b> the fuzzy adaptive control is provided to shift the power curve. The shifting action is decided by the gears and the corresponding engine speed together with the displacements of both the hydraulic pump and motor. As a result, the power line adapts to the frequent changes in different external loads. A prototype motor <b>grader</b> is developed to test the above-mentioned energy conservation method in different working conditions. The {{results show that the}} fuel consumption of the prototype motor is reduced by 23 %– 34 % and the skip ratio is decreased by 10 % compared with the traditional <b>grader</b> with only one power curve.
