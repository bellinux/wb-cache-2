40|$|INTRODUCTION : The study {{compared}} {{modification of}} canal curvature and {{the incidence of}} canal aberrations after glide path preparation using four different instrumentation techniques. METHODS : One hundred and twenty S-shaped Endo- Training-Blocks were selected, the canals coloured with ink and digital images acquired. Glide paths were prepared by a single operator with stainless steel K-files by hand (Group 1), stainless steel K-files in a reciprocating hand piece (Group 2), PathFile (Group 3) and X-Plorer files (Group 4). Pre-instrumentation and post-instrumentation images were superimposed to evaluate the parameters investigated. The images were also examined by three blinded operators {{for the presence of}} aberrations. Differences in canal curvature modification were analysed with respect to logarithmic transformed change from baseline using ANCOVA (p< 0. 001) with logarithmic transformed pre-instrumentation values as covariate. The incidence of canal aberrations was analyzed using Fisher’s exact test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS : There was no difference between PathFiles and X-Plorer files (p< 0. 001) and both systems demonstrated significantly less modification of curvature compared with <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> and <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> in a reciprocating hand-piece (p< 0. 001). The Groups differed significantly regarding the number of aberrations (p= 0. 005). <b>Hand</b> <b>files</b> and <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> in the reciprocating hand piece did not differ statistically (p= 0. 254; 20 % and 6. 67 %). However, <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> in reciprocating hand piece also did not differ significantly from PathFiles and X-Plorer files (p= 0. 326). There were no aberrations detected in the rotary NiTi Groups. CONCLUSION : The stainless steel K-files in the reciprocating hand-piece performed better than their use by hand only. Overall, PathFiles and X-Plorer files equally demonstrated the least modification to original canal geometry. Further research utilising the different techniques in extracted teeth is warranted.

This study compared clinical outcomes for 40 necrotic immature permanent incisors treated with calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH) 2] or mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) apexification/apexogenesis. MethodsForty necrotic open-apex incisors from 40 children aged 6. 5 – 10 years were divided evenly into four groups with each group containing teeth of similar type and similar root apex width in patients of similar age. Group 1 incisors were treated with ultrasonic filing and MTA placement; Group 2 were treated with ultrasonic filing and Ca(OH) 2 medication; Group 3 were treated with <b>hand</b> <b>filing</b> and MTA placement; and Group 4 were treated with <b>hand</b> <b>filing</b> and Ca(OH) 2 medication. ResultsGroup 1 incisors needed the shortest mean duration (5. 4  ±  1. 1 weeks) for apical hard tissue barrier formation, followed by Group 3 incisors (7. 8  ±  1. 8 weeks), Group 2 incisors (11. 3  ±  1. 3 weeks), and Group 4 incisors (13. 1  ±  1. 5 weeks). Group 1 incisors had a significantly shorter mean elongated root length (2. 1  ±  0. 2  mm) after treatment than Group 2 incisors (3. 5  ±  0. 3  mm, p <  0. 001), and Group 3 incisors had a significantly shorter mean elongated root length (2. 1  ±  0. 1  mm) after treatment than Group 4 incisors (3. 7  ±  0. 3  mm, p <  0. 001).

Methods Two hundred forty mandibular incisors were mounted in resin blocks with simulated periodontal ligaments, and the apex was exposed. The root canals were instrumented with rotary and <b>hand</b> <b>files,</b> namely K 3, ProTaper, and nickel-titanium Flex K files to the major apical foramen (AF), short AF, or beyond AF. Digital images of the apical surface of every tooth were taken during the apical enlargement at each file change. Development of dentinal defects was determined by comparing these images with the baseline image. Multinomial logistic regression test was performed to identify influencing factors. Results Apical crack developed in 1 of 80 teeth (1. 3 %) with <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> and 31 of 160 teeth (19. 4 %) with rotary files. Apical dentinal detachment developed in 2 of 80 teeth (2. 5 %) with <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> and 35 of 160 teeth (21. 9 %) with rotary files. Instrumentation with rotary files terminated 2 mm short of AF and did not cause any cracks. Significantly less cracks and detachments occurred when instrumentation with rotary files was terminated short of AF, as compared with that terminated at or beyond AF (P <. 05).

40|$|Introduction: Modern nickel-titanium {{instruments}} have various tapers {{and have}} been marketed to have superior flexibility from previous generations. Current ISO standards require force measurements at a static point along the file. Unfortunately, root canal anatomy varies and produces multiple forces {{along the length of}} the file. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of taper on the flexibility of various nickel-titanium files. Materials and Methods: The flexibility of stainless steel <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> and nickel-titanium rotary files of various tapers was measured. The sample size was 10 for each type, taper and size. The files were measured at 3, 5 and 7 mm from the tip using a digital caliper and marked with a rubber stopper and a distance of 20 mm from the tip was used as the deflection point. Each file was securely fastened on a load-sensing cell and bending was accomplished using a universal testing machine to a maximum deflection of 4. 5 mm at a rate of 2 mm/minute under room temperature conditions (22 OC ± 1 OC). Data was collected electronically via Merlin Software and transferred to Microsoft Excel. Statistical analysis was completed with IBM SPSS Statistics software and a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used as well as a Post-hoc Tukey test. Results: The force and bending moments of EndoSequence. 06 taper files was significantly greater (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) than EndoSequence. 04 and stainless steel <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> at all lengths. No significant difference was noted between EndoSequence. 04 and stainless steel <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> from 0. 25 mm to 3. 0 mm. From 3. 5 mm to 4. 5 mm, the force and bending moments for stainless steel <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> was significantly greater (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) than EndoSequence. 04 files. Within each file group, the force and bending moments were significantly greater (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) as the grasp length increased (7 mm 3 ̆e 5 mm 3 ̆e 3 mm). Conclusions: With a vast array of root canal instruments currently available clinicians should consider the properties of instruments before cleaning and shaping. Nickel-titanium files with tapers greater than 0. 04 should not be used for apical enlargement of curved canals because these files are significantly stiffer resulting in an increased chance of canal transportation...|$|E

Aim To compare {{the effectiveness of}} two Ni-Ti systems and <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> for removing gutta-percha and sealer from root canals. Methodology The root canals of 60 single-rooted human teeth were prepared, filled with gutta-percha and sealer (Pulp Canal Sealer; SybronEndo, Orange, CA, USA). Specimens were then divided into three groups (n = 20), and root filling material was removed using MTwo Retreatment Files (group 1); R-Endo (group 2); K-files and Gates-Glidden drills (group 3). After retreatment, the efficacy of each technique was assessed using radiographs that were later digitized and the images analysed using AutoCAD 2004. The percentage of residual gutta-percha was calculated for the whole canal {{as well as for}} the coronal, middle and apical thirds. Time required, apically extruded debris and the number of fractured instruments were also recorded. Data were statistically analysed using Kruskal– Wallis and Mann–Whitney U-tests. Results All instrumentation techniques left guttapercha and sealer remnants inside the root canals. Ni-Ti systems were significantly faster (P < 0. 05) than the manual technique and significantly more effective (P < 0. 05) in removing gutta-percha particularly from the middle and apical thirds of the root canal.

Filing operation {{can be used on}} a wide range of materials as a finishing and burr removing operation. However mostly <b>hand</b> <b>filing</b> is done in industrial fields which is time consuming and not effective as much. Filing is probably very important and most frequent operation in metal work. The filing is done generally by hand with one hand on wood handle and other hand on tip of file. The aim of the present work is reduce human efforts in the filing process by designing the advanced filing machine. There are many problems related to <b>hand</b> <b>filing.</b> So, this paper describes filing process by use of small machine. Prior to the development of modern machining equipment it provided a relatively accurate means for the production of small parts, especially those with flat surfaces.

Each specimen was sectioned horizontally with low speed diamond saw under water cooling into three parts at 3 mm, 6 mm and 9 mm from the apex. Sections were evaluated for the presence of fracture under stereomicroscope at 25...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Maintaining the {{original}} canal path {{and safety of}} canal preparation during instrumentation in curved canals {{have been subjected to}} many challenges. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare several parameters of root canal preparation using flexmaster rotary and hand used Nickel-Titanium instruments. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, sixty extracted human teeth with root canal curvatures between 10 and 42 degress were devided into two similar groups with equal mean curvatures. Root canals in one group were prepared using flexmaster rotary instruments and the other with NiTi <b>hand</b> <b>files.</b> After canal preparation, different parameters such as straightening of curved root canal, loss of working length, fracture rate, perforation and working time, were evaluated and compared between the two groups. Data were analyzed by t student test with p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: Results showed that both instruments maintained {{the original}} canals' curvature. No loss of working length, instruments fracture or perforation was recorded. Working time was significantly shorter for flexmaster than <b>hand</b> <b>files.</b> Conclusion: Both systems under investigation respected original root canal curvature and were safe to use. Therefore the rotary techniques could be successfully introduced to undergraduate endodontic programmes...|$|E
40|$|To {{compare the}} quality of calcium {{hydroxide}} paste fillings performed by three different techniques. Sixty extracted maxillary central incisors, with previous root canal treatment, were decoronated and the gutta-percha was completely removed from the root canals. Subsequently, the canals were filled with a calcium hydroxide-based paste composed of calcium hydroxide, bismuth carbonate, and glycerin. The study samples were divided into the following three groups {{on the basis of}} three insertion techniques (n = 20, each) : conventional technique using a hand instrument (MAN), rotary Lentulo spiral (LEN) technique, and a combined technique combining conventional <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> with sonic activation through the EndoActivator device (EA). The quality of fillings was evaluated radiographically by two examiners {{on the basis of the}} amount of voids and the apical limit. The canals filled with LEN or MAN had less void volume compared to the EA technique (P > 0. 01), with no significant differences between them. Considering the apical limits, the three tested techniques showed comparable results (P > 0. 05). A combined approach utilizing <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> with sonic activation showed no enhancements over the LEN or MAN techniques on {{the quality of}} intracanal placement of calcium hydroxide paste...|$|E
40|$|Background: One of the {{objectives}} of root canal preparation is to clean and shape the root canal system while maintaining the original configuration. Therefore, {{it is important to}} keep the instruments centered to provide a correct enlargement, without excessive weakening of the root structure. Aim: The aim of the study was to compare canal transportation and centering ability of K 3 (0. 02 % taper) and K 3 (0. 04 % taper) with stainless steel <b>hand</b> K <b>files</b> in primary teeth using a spiral computed tomography (SCT) scan. Materials and Methods: A total of 75 extracted mandibular primary second molars was collected. Canals were divided randomly into three groups of 25 teeth each. Group I: K 3 files (0. 02 % taper), Group II: K 3 (0. 04 % taper), and Group III: Stainless steel <b>hand</b> K <b>files.</b> Three regions from apical, mid-root, and coronal levels of the canal were recorded. All the teeth were scanned before and after instrumentation by using SCT. Results: K 3 (0. 02 % taper) showed less canal transportation and a better centering ratio than K 3 (0. 04 % taper) and stainless steel <b>hand</b> K <b>files.</b> Statistical Analysis: The mean values were compared between different study groups and the P-value was calculated by using Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA. The Mann-Whitney U-test followed by the Bonferroni correction method was employed to identify the significant groups at the 5 % level. Conclusion: K 3 (0. 02 % taper) shaped root canals without significant shaping errors when compared to K 3 (0. 04 % taper) and stainless steel <b>hand</b> K <b>files</b> in primary teeth...|$|R

TACTIC also acts as a librarian, sorting the files it receives into the appropriate location in the repository. If specified by the system, file names will also be renamed accordingly to make their locations more identifiable (a function cognate to card cataloguing). TACTIC's automated file management system ensures that files are uniformly named and appear in predictable and reliable locations, effectively eliminating human error in the repository.|$|R
