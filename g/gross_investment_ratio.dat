40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{a method of}} approximating the development of investment in transition economies through an amendment of the standard adjustment cost formulation for investment within dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. Letting adjustment cost depend on {{the difference between the}} investment levels of two periods (rather than only on the <b>gross</b> <b>investment</b> <b>ratio)</b> leads to an investment behavior of the representative household that resembles the observed time paths of investment in transition countries. In contrast to standard adjustment costs, which predict a sharp rise in investment due to the high marginal productivity of each unit of capital after a capital shock, augmented adjustment costs lead to a gradual rise in investment.

40|$|Heroic Plant {{research}} shows that persistently-rapid job creation by {{a select group of}} plants can be an important source of overall employment growth in manufacturing. Establishments in SICs 34 - 38 whose residual growth (after controlling for differences in plant age, size, industry, etc.) ranks in the top quarter of establishment growth rates across both 1977 - 1982 and 1982 - 1987, account for roughly 25 % of total job creation by plants operating throughout this time. While these exceptional job creators tend to participate especially in growing sectors of the economy (favoring, for example, commercial over industrial markets), they are active across a variety of product markets, production processes and price ranges. Thus, sustained job growth does not appear simply to be a sectoral phenomenon within particular industries. Neither does Heroic Plant job creation appear {{to be the result of}} random shocks to establishment growth. Rather, in spite of the difficulties in measuring performance characteristics using time-series data, Heroic Plants display numerous characteristics of successful plants. For example, when their exceptional growth begins to be tracked (1977), these establishments are more capital intensive and productive, and they pay higher wages, than do plants whose growth will be less rapid and/or persistent during the next decade. They also distinguish themselves by larger <b>gross</b> <b>investment</b> <b>ratios</b> (relative to their current employment, value added or capital stock). In 1987, Heroic Plants are more productive than other establishments, in spite of their labor-intensive operations. These plants share with other persistent (although less rapid) growers an above-average tendency to use advanced technologies in 1988. Heroic Plants also pay lower wages to production workers than do other establishments, raising questions about the division of returns, between management and workers, from superior business performance. employment growth manufacturing technology...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we make {{explicit}} {{the relationship that}} exists between a set of structural reforms –as those undertaken in Argentina at {{the beginnings of the}} nineties- and the growth process that they generate. It is argued that such reforms, and particularly those related to the external sector, improve the efficiency in resource allocation and hence bring about an increase in the marginal productivity of the existing per capita capital stock. This improvement in efficiency puts the economy on a growth path having either temporary or permanent characteristics. In this model, as in other intertemporal paradigms of open economies with optimizing agents, the country resorts to the international credit market in order to finance higher consumption and investment levels. paper also offers empirical evidence on a set of countries which implemented reforms deemed to be successful in terms of the evolution of the key economic variables, that is, the rate of per capita gross domestic product, the <b>gross</b> <b>investment</b> to product <b>ratio,</b> and the product to capital incremental ratio (as an approximation to the marginal productivity of capital). Additionally, we trace the changes in the openness coefficient as an indicator of the scope of one of the reforms that attend successful structural changes. on the results obtained from the model and the international empirical evidence, it is recommended to deepen the overall policy of structural reforms –of which external openness is a part- in order to generate a sustained growth process...|$|R

40|$|In specifying third {{generation}} models of factor demands, adjustment costs are frequently {{treated as a}} function of net rather than <b>gross</b> <b>investment.</b> Such specifications assume replacement investment is frictionless and in equilibrium adjustment costs are zero. Recognition that adjustment costs may reflect not only net but also <b>gross</b> <b>investment</b> leads to a more complex model. But the revised model implies increasing long-run average costs. Such a model can still be specified to impose constant long-run average costs, or constant returns to scale.

However, empirical work suggests that conventionally labelled expressions of adjustment costs embrace other influences.

Analyses show that the average growth rate for African countries was only 0. 6 percent, and <b>gross</b> <b>investment</b> rate of only 10 percent.

But more subtle analysis of the relationship between investment and economic growth show that, for 23 OECD countries, average growth rate was 2. 7 percent lower than the rate of growth of the Asian tigers, where the rate of investment was 24 percent, almost identical to that the Asian tigers.
