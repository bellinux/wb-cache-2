5|$|The Washington Post {{columnist}} Dana Milbank {{wrote in}} his 2010 book Tears of a Clown, that Beck had been baited by Eiland-Hall to confirm {{the importance of the}} United Nations. Alexander Zaitchik came to a similar conclusion in his 2010 book Common Nonsense, and pointed out the discrepancy between Beck's criticism of the United Nations as part of a New World Order with Beck's subsequent reliance upon the WIPO where he chose to file the case. The case was cited by Jude A. Thomas in a 2011 article published in the John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the conflicts between freedom of speech and trademark, Thomas noted that panels of the UDRP have concluded website operators had fair use over domain names even in cases where the name in question was exactly the same as that trademarked by the individual filing the complaint to the WIPO.|$|E

25|$|Ptolemy {{also wrote}} {{influential}} work Harmonics on music theory. After criticizing the approaches of his predecessors, Ptolemy argued for basing musical intervals on mathematical ratios (in {{contrast to the}} followers of Aristoxenus) backed up by empirical observation (in contrast to the over-theoretical approach of the Pythagoreans). He presented his own divisions of the tetrachord and the octave, which he derived {{with the help of}} a monochord.

25|$|The {{formation}} of proliferating buds in ebony spleenwort has also {{given rise to}} a taxonomic treatment. Bud formation was first observed by Conrad Loddiges in 1817, in specimens in cultivation in Great Britain. However, the phenomenon was overlooked until 1879, when D. C. Eaton observed it in specimens from Florida. He took this for an aberrant variety, which he named A.ebeneum var.proliferum. Willard Clute reduced its status from a variety to a form, A.ebeneum f.proliferum, in 1906. Similar specimens were subsequently reported from Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut; the buds appeared on the rachis of sterile fronds, and were often only detected when mounting the specimen. In 1924, Frederick G. Floyd argued that the {{formation of}} these proliferations was a normal characteristic of the species, which appeared regularly, if not universally, and did not warrant a varietal designation. He also observed the formation of proliferating buds on a fertile rachis of A.ebeneum var.serratum. Floyd's position was not universally accepted: Louise Tanger made a new combination for the form, A.platyneuron f.proliferum in 1933, and Taylor et al. recognized it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> infraspecific taxa in the species in 1976. However, these authors noted that specimens of A.platyneuron f.proliferum would be assigned to various other varieties if they were not proliferous. Wagner & Johnson, in 1981, declined to recognize the taxon on grounds similar to Floyd's, and Wagner's treatment in Flora of North America does not mention the form.|$|E

500|$|Music was a {{major part}} of {{everyday}} life. [...] The word itself derives from Greek μουσική (mousike), [...] "(art) of the Muses". Many private and public events were accompanied by music, ranging from nightly dining to military parades and manoeuvres. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to be reminded that much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use may not have been familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier.|$|E
500|$|Jill Deans, in a 2000 article, {{used the}} book <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> adoption, surrogacy, and particularly, embryo donation. She {{noted that it}} is [...] "a classic tale of surrogacy" [...] and that it [...] "evokes {{the intricacies of the}} nature/nurture debate". She contends that the book celebrates adoptive parents and caregivers, in the form of Horton, but vilifies birth mothers, in the form of Mayzie. Both Deans and Philip Nel point to the book's real-life {{implications}} for Geisel and his wife. Deans draws a connection between the elephant-bird in Horton and the Infantograph, a failed invention Geisel created that combined two photos and was meant to give couples an idea of what their children would look like. Nel, meanwhile, connected the book to the short story [...] "Matilda the Elephant". Noting that the Geisels could not have children, Nel argued that [...] "Matilda", and by extension Horton, may have been manifestations of the Geisels' longing for children.|$|E
500|$|The Man in the Moone was {{published}} {{five months after}} The Discovery of a World in the Moone by John Wilkins, later bishop of Chester. Wilkins refers to Godwin once, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> spots in the Moon, but not to Godwin's book. In the third edition of The Discovery (1640), however, Wilkins provides a summary of Godwin's book, and later in Mercury (1641) he comments on The Man in the Moone and Nuncius Inanimatus, saying that [...] "the former text {{could be used to}} unlock the secrets of the latter". The Man in the Moone quickly became an international [...] "source of humour and parody": Cyrano de Bergerac, using Baudoin's 1648 translation, parodied it in [...] (1657); Cyrano's traveller actually meets Gonsales, who is still on the Moon, [...] "degraded to the status of pet monkey". It was one of the inspirations for what has been called the first science fiction text in the Americas, Syzygies and Lunar Quadratures Aligned to the Meridian of Mérida of the Yucatán by an Anctitone or Inhabitant of the Moon... by Manuel Antonio de Rivas (1775). The Laputan language of Jonathan Swift, who was a distant relation of Godwin's, may have been influenced by The Man in the Moone, either directly or through Cyrano de Bergerac.|$|E

500|$|Author Joley Wood {{compared}} [...] "Lisa the Skeptic" [...] to {{an alternate}} reality game, {{in analyzing the}} effects of watching the television program Lost on contemporary culture and our own perceptions of reality. Dan O'Brien cited the episode <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> ontology, skepticism, and religious faith, in his book An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge. O'Brien leaves {{it up to the}} reader {{to decide whether or not}} Lisa was justified in her skepticism. In , [...] "Lisa the Skeptic" [...] is cited as a prime example of why Lisa is seen as the epitome of a nerd. The book also cited the episode in noting that Lisa is not infallible, for when the Angel appeared to speak at the end of the episode she became as frightened as everyone else. Lisa's frustration with the marketing gimmick used by the mall developers is seen by Turner's [...] as yet another example of her conflict with corporations throughout the series. Like O'Brien, Turner also analyzed the episode in the context of Lisa's questions about existentialism, self-absorption, and consumption. In , the authors discuss Lisa's level of anger displayed in the episode, noting that in this particular case her anger gave her the wherewithal both to confront social injustice, and keep her mind clear for critical thinking. Mark Demming of Allmovie noted that Lisa symbolically stood for the side of reason, while her mother Marge symbolized belief and spirituality in the episode.|$|E
