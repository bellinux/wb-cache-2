The term <b>functional</b> <b>filler</b> is intended to indicate that the material added to the plastic does more than take up space and extend the use of the polymer. Determining the <b>functional</b> <b>filler</b> potential of ash was not the only intent of this project, since another prime objective was to find a use for materials currently considered waste. The term <b>functional</b> <b>filler</b> also opened a door to the use of cenospheres, which are currently marketed and for which there is sufficient market demand that they do not fit the category of a waste even though they are a product of coal combustion. Cenospheres, hollow spherical ash particles, were selected because of their unique properties. Although they currently have commercial applications, the unique nature of these materials make them an excellent candidate for use as a <b>functional</b> <b>filler</b> in composites. The ability to produce a commercially viable product from waste streams and a recycled material is a positive step toward reducing solid waste. The first task, since there are numerous types of coal ash, was to select suitable ash types for use in this project.

This paper investigates a method for the mechanical recycling of thermoset polyurethane. Reaction injection moulded (RIM) polyurethane (PU) was granulated and introduced as filler in novel moulding compounds. The polyurethane recyclate granules were compounded with polyester resin for compression moulding. A variety of different materials were moulded to demonstrate the recycling possibilities, these included non-reinforced filled thermoset, glass fibre reinforced compounds and sandwich materials with a core containing recyclate. Mechanical testing of the materials showed that the addition of polyurethane recyclate increased flexibility and toughness of the mouldings, when compared with compounds containing mineral fillers. The increased toughness is explained by the microstructure, the PU granules rubber toughen the resin by allowing micro-cracking of the thermoset resin matrix without brittle failure.

In addition, the sludge is mistakenly viewed as waste that has to be disposed of in landfill. State of the art in recovery and utilisation of calcareous sawdust is mainly aimed in uses as substitute for more expensive ingredient in the building sector. Moreover limestone dust, recovered from marble sawing and processing slurry, has not yet found real economically feasible industrial usage.

30|$|In {{the last}} decades, piezoresistive {{composite}} materials have found extensive potential application {{in the fields}} of micro-sensors [1, 2], electromechanical devices, circuit breakers [3], touchable sensitive screens, and tactile sensors for robotics [4], providing cheaper, faster, and more accurate alternatives than the commercially available devices. The properties of these materials could be tuned by varying the nature and the morphology of the particles, used as <b>functional</b> <b>filler</b> and the type of matrix [5]. Several papers report on composites prepared by incorporating different conductive fillers, mostly carbon structures (carbon black and nanotubes) and metal particles in an insulating polymer matrix (e.g., silicones, polyurethane, acrylics, etc.) [6, 7]. By varying the type and amount of fillers, the composite can assume the electrical properties of an insulator up to those of a good conductor. In the piezoresistive composites based on tunneling conduction mechanism, a small variation of the external load induces a huge change of the electrical conductivity [8 – 10]. In these materials, each conductive particle is separated from the others by a thin layer of insulating polymer representing the tunneling barrier [11]. Under the effect of an applied pressure, a mechanical deformation is induced, and the polymer thickness reduces, thus decreasing the tunneling barrier. As a consequence, the probability of tunneling phenomena increases, resulting in a large reduction of the bulk electrical resistance. In these composites, the shape and dimension of the filler particles become as important as the filler nature and amount. In particular, the composites prepared with conductive particles presenting sharp and nanostructured tips on the surface exhibit a huge variation of the electrical conduction in response to a mechanical strain. In fact, this morphology is responsible for a local electric field enhancement [12] that considerably increases the tunneling probability through the insulating barrier.|$|E

30|$|Polymer based {{composites}} involving various dispersed, fibrous and layered fillers {{are one of}} {{the main}} types of modern vibration damping materials (VPM).

A wealth of property data has been generated by conducting various tests under controlled laboratory conditions and the analysis of the test results is presented in the thesis. The quality of coating in terms of mechanical, micro-structural and functional characteristics depends on a large number of variables that include both materials as well as operational parameters.

A salient structural feature of the CPE is the close-packed Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles in the liquid electrolyte-swollen ETPTA macromer matrix. Owing to this unique morphology, the CPE provides significant improvements in the mechanical bendability and suppression of lithium dendrite growth during repeated charge/discharge cycling of cells. In addition, the CPE precursor mixture (i. e., prior to UV irradiation) with well-tailored rheological properties, via collaboration with UV-assisted imprint lithography technique, enables the generation of micropatterned CPE with tunable dimensions. Notably, the cell incorporating the self-standing PCE based CPE, which acts as thermally-stable electrolyte and also separator membrane, maintains stable charge/discharge behavior even after exposure to thermal shock condition (= 130 ℃/ 0. 5 h), while a control cell assembled with carbonate-based liquid electrolyte and polyethylene separator membrane loses electrochemical activity.

In view of this, the present investigation reports on the development and performance of new class es of plasma sprayed coatings and polymer composites using Linz-Donawitz slag (LDS) as the primary material. This LDS is a major solid waste generated in huge quantities during steel making and its chemical analysis suggests the presence of oxides of silicon, calcium and iron in it. The research reported in this thesis broadly consists of two parts: The first part has provided {{the description of the}} materials used, the experimental details and the methods adopted for analysis of experimental results. This part has also presented various physical and mechanical characteristics of the plasma sprayed LDS based coatings and LDS filled epoxy and polypropylene composites. An assessment of LDS as a potential coating material and a particulate filler in polymers has been made by evaluating the physical and mechanical properties of these coatings and composites under controlled laboratory conditions. Effects of premixing of Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 powders on the physical and mechanical properties of LD slag coatings have also been reported. The second part of the thesis reports on the erosion wear characteristics of these coatings and composites. The wear response of LDS, ‘LDS + Al 2 O 3 ’ and ‘LDS + TiO 2 ’ coatings have been discussed separately. Comparisons between the erosion characteristics of LD slag filled epoxy and polypropylene composites with and without glass fiber reinforcement have also been presented. Parametric analysis and wear response prediction has been made for all the coatings and composites under this study using statistical techniques namely Taguchi experimental design and artificial neural networks (ANN). Correlations have been developed to predict the wear rate for these coatings and composites under different test conditions. x This work suggests that LDS is eminently coatable and deposition of such coatings using plasma spraying route is possible. These coatings possess desirable characteristics such as good adhesion strength, hardness etc. This work further establishes that LD slag can also be used as a <b>functional</b> <b>filler</b> in both thermoset and thermoplastic polymers. These LD slag filled composites possess very low amount of porosity and improved micro-hardness. They also exhibit improved impact strength as compared to that of the neat polymers. The tensile and flexural strength of the composites are affected by the weight fraction of LDS in the composites. With improved hardness, these composites have the potential to be used in wear related applications. Erosion wear characteristics of LDS coatings and LDS filled polymer composites have been successfully analyzed using Taguchi technique. Significant factors affecting the erosion rate of these coatings and composites are identified through successful implementation of this technique. Two predictive models; one based on artificial neural networks (ANN) approach and the other on Taguchi approach are proposed in this work. It is demonstrated that these models well reflect the effects of various factors on the wear loss and their predictive results are consistent with the experimental observations.

The objective is to explore {{the possibility of using}} multiple ceramic fillers in polymers to make composites suitable for microelectronic applications. The first part of the report is on the development of theoretical heat conduction models based on which mathematical correlations have been proposed for estimation of effective thermal conductivity of polymer composites with single as well as hybrid fillers. The second part has provided the description of the materials used, routes adopted to fabricate the various epoxy and polypropylene composites and the details of the experiments that are conducted during this research. It also presents the test results in regard to the physical, micro-structural and mechanical characteristics of all the epoxy and polypropylene based composites filled with single filler i. e. micro-sized Aluminium nitride (AlN) / Aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3). A comparative evaluation of the effects of premixing of solid glass microspheres with micro-sized AlN/Al 2 O 3 on the different physical and mechanical properties of composite systems is also reported. The last part has emphasized on the thermal and dielectric characteristics of the composites under this investigation. It includes an assessment of the effective thermal conductivity of these composites using the proposed theoretical models. Effects of inclusion of various combinations of single/hybrid fillers on the effective thermal conductivity (keff), glass transition temperature (Tg), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and dielectric constant (ɛc) of the composites are presented. Analytical models developed in this work for evaluating effective thermal conductivity of single/hybrid filler reinforced polymer composites are based on the principle of law of minimal thermal resistance and equal law of specific equivalent thermal conductivity. The values obtained from the theoretical model for single filler polymer composites are in close approximation with the corresponding measured values up to percolation threshold. For hybrid filler model, the calculated values are in good approximation for the entire range of filler content as no percolation is seen for hybrid composites. Percolation is the phenomenon which occurs when the content of conductive filler in matrix becomes substantially high so as to form thermal bridges across the planes throughout the system resulting in a sudden improvement of conductivity. The volume fraction of filler at which sudden jump in the composite effective thermal conductivity occurs is called the percolation threshold of that filler-matrix combination. This phenomenon however has not occurred for hybrid filler composites. The present research also shows that the selected aluminum based ceramic powders have the potential to be successfully used as <b>functional</b> <b>filler</b> materials in both thermoset and thermoplastic polymers. It is also noticed that the epoxy based composites have higher void fraction compared to that in the polypropylene based composites. Inclusion of spherical particles in these polymeric resins has not resulted in any improvement in the load bearing capacity (tensile strength). On the other hand, hardness and compressive strength values have been found to have improved invariably for all the composites. Inclusion of single filler i. e. micro-sized AlN/Al 2 O 3 appreciably enhances the effective thermal conductivity of polymers. Other thermal properties like CTE and Tg also get modified accordingly. But, with addition of these fillers, little increase in the value dielectric constant is noted. The polymer composite fabricated in present work must possess low dielectric constant which does not get completely fulfilled with single fillers. So SGM is introduced as a secondary filler to overcome this problem. With the addition of SGM in combination with AlN/Al 2 O 3 modifies various physical, mechanical and thermal properties. But most importantly, a noticeable change is observed in case of dielectric constant value. With SGM as the secondary filler, much lower value of dielectric constant is obtained which is almost around that of the neat polymer. It is seen that apart from the effective thermal conductivity, all the other properties shows positive modification for hybrid filler composites as compared to single filler composites as far as their applications in microelectronics are concerned. The particulate filled polymer composites developed for this investigation are expected to have adequate potential {{for a wide variety of}} applications particularly in microelectronic industries. With enhanced thermal conductivity, improved glass transition temperature, reduced thermal expansion coefficient and modified dielectric characteristics, the epoxy and polypropylene composites with appropriate proportions of fillers can be used in microelectronic applications like electronic packaging, encapsulations, printed circuit board substrates etc. ...|$|E
40|$|Functional lignin–SiO 2 hybrid fillers were {{prepared}} for potential application in binders for phenolic resins, and their chemical structure was characterized. The properties of these fillers and of composites obtained from them with phenolic resin were {{compared with those of}} systems with lignin or silica alone. The chemical structure of the materials was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and carbon- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13 C CP MAS NMR). The thermal stability of the new <b>functional</b> <b>fillers</b> was examined by thermogravimetric analysis–mass spectrometry (TG-MS). Thermo-mechanical properties of the lignin–silica hybrids and resin systems were investigated by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The DMTA results showed that abrasive composites with lignin–SiO 2 fillers have better thermo-mechanical properties than systems with silica alone. Thus, fillers based on lignin might provide new, promising properties for the abrasive industry, combining the good properties of lignin as a plasticizer and of silica as a filler improving mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|Deployment of folded paper {{architecture}} using a fluid medium as the morphing stimulus {{presents a}} simple and inexpensive methodology capable of self-actuation; where the underlying principles can be translated to develop smart fibrous materials capable of programmable actuations. In this study we characterise different paper architectures and their stimuli mechanisms for folded deployment; including the influence of porosity, moisture, surfactant concentration, temperature, and hornification. We observe that actuation time decreases with paper grammage; through the addition of surfactants, and when the temperature is increased at the fluid-vapour interface. There is a clear effect of hydration, water transport and the interaction of hydrogen bonds within the fibrous architecture which drives the deployment of the folded regions. The importance of fibre volume fraction and <b>functional</b> <b>fillers</b> in shape recovery was also observed, {{as well as the}} effect of a multilayer composite paper system. The design guidelines shown here will inform the development of synthetic fibrous actuators for repeated deployment...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the past}} decade, we have {{witnessed}} unprecedented increase in the quantities and variety of the electromagnetic field sources used for domestic, industrial, and military purposes. Of late, the protection from the ultra high frequency (UHF) electromagnetic radiation is gaining importance owing to human health care {{and quality of life}} and work improvement. Independently from the variety of produced absorbers, the problem with development of new, more effective, and cheap absorbing materials becomes a question of interest. The mainly used <b>functional</b> <b>fillers</b> in rubber-based composites effectively absorbing UHF electromagnetic radiations are carbonyl iron or magnetite, in same cases in combination with graphite or carbon black. At the same time in sinter plants of the extraction ferrous metallurgy, after gas cleaning equipment (electrostatic precipitators (ESP)) up to thousand tons of waste powder have been generated annually. The X-ray diffraction analysis shows that powder contains mainly magnetite. In the present research on the base of waste sinter powder a filler modified with carbon was obtained.
