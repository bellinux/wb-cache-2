25|$|Irrigation is {{extremely}} wasteful of water because the distribution infrastructure is old and poorly maintained. In 1993 only an estimated 5% of required maintenance expenditures was allocated. Overall, an estimated 70% of the nation's water supply network {{is in need}} of repair or replacement. The quality of drinking water from this aging system is poorly monitored—the water management staff has been cut drastically because of inadequate funds. Further, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> to buy new water disinfection equipment when it is needed. Some aquifers near industrial and mining centers have been contaminated by heavy metals, oils, and sanitary wastes. In addition, many localities rely on surface sources, making users vulnerable to agricultural runoff and livestock waste, which seep gradually downward from the surface. The areas of lowest water quality are the heavily populated regions of the Chui Valley and Osh and Jalal-Abad Regions, and areas along the rivers flowing into Ysyk-Köl.|$|E
25|$|In her day-to-day life, {{when things}} are too boring or upsetting, Selma slips into daydreams or perhaps a trance-like state where she imagines the {{ordinary}} circumstances and individuals around her have erupted into elaborate musical theater numbers. These songs use some sort of real-life noise (from factory machines buzzing {{to the sound of}} a flag rapping against a flag pole in the wind) as an underlying rhythm. Unfortunately, Selma slips into one such trance while working at the factory. Soon Jeff and Cvalda begin to realize that Selma can barely see at all. Additionally, Bill reveals to Selma that his materialistic wife Linda spends more than his salary, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> left from his inheritance, and he is behind in payments and the bank is going to take his house. He asks Selma for a loan, but she declines. He regrets telling Selma his secret. To comfort Bill, Selma reveals her secret blindness, hoping that together they can keep each other's secret. Bill then hides in the corner of Selma's home, knowing she can't see him, and watches as she puts some money in her kitchen tin.|$|E
25|$|Mariano's first {{experience}} with art was at fours years old with his cousin, teaching him how to draw simple shapes. He and his brother, Jonathan Ching who would also grow up to become an artist, would spend their time to draw instead of playing outside. He was greatly influenced by the anime Mazinger Z and Voltes V which was widely popular during his youth. They would significantly affect his future works. Reaching his high school years, his parents reminded him to think carefully about his life career. They said there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> in art and should consider medicine or engineering as career and to make art as a hobby. But despite his parents' constant reminder, Mariano still pursued the road of becoming an artist. He enrolled {{to a lot of}} art workshops to hone his skills. One of the workshops that he attended became the turn point of his life. At the art workshop which is headed by Elemer Borogan and Gina Morales, the art style of the paintings has touched him and made him to decide to switch from his fourth year engineering major to painting major in University of the Philippines. During his years in University of the Philippines, he co-founded the art group Surrounded by Water. There, he found his future wife, Yasmin Sison which {{is also a member of}} Surrounded by Water. Mariano Ching, at that time, was still new at the art scene and he has not garnered any recognition yet.|$|E

25|$|Rob Donovan reads {{an article}} in the {{newspaper}} about Johnny at the factory. He then requests a visit from Tracy and tells his prison cellmate that he plans for revenge on Tracy and Carla of how they disowned him and how they called the police and had him jailed. Tracy turned up to visit Rob and wondered why he had chosen to contact her after such time, however Rob confessed to being angry at first but could never stop loving her and he did not blame her for him being arrested. After Tracy's visit, Rob requested a visit from Johnny, and reveals that he is the father of Carla. He demands £10,000 from Johnny to keep it secret. Johnny told him that Tracy was with Robert Preston. Johnny does everything in his power to ensure that nobody finds out, but steals some of Carla's DNA to perform a paternity test behind her back. Rob then sent a visiting order to Robert. He told him about Tracy wanting to start a new relationship with him. Robert was disgusted and stormed out. He then split up with Tracy. Rob reveals to Tracy that everything was a lie and that he still hated her. Johnny reveals all to a disgusted Carla. Carla is furious, however Johnny continues to plead with Carla not to tell Aidan and Kate. Carla Sleeps with Robert. She instantly regrets it, and confides in Michelle, who attempts to persuade Carla not to tell Nick. Carla continues to threaten to tell Johnny's children the truth unless he moves away, which he does not. Carla reveals that she is their half-sister to Kate and Aidan, who are distraught. Carla is shocked to find that Robert plans to buy a share in the Bistro. Carla begs him to reconsider, but Robert threatens to reveal their affair to Nick if she does not let him buy into the Bistro. Carla finds it increasingly difficult to keep her deceit under wraps. She also begins bonding with Kate. Carla tells Nick that she cannot marry him, but changes her mind. Upon hearing that Robert is intending on going into business with Nick, Carla goes to the bistro to confront him. Carla and Robert engage in a bitter argument, with their one-night stand being mentioned. Tracy, who has recently reconciled with Robert, has overheard their conversation. Robert then leaves, and Carla drowns her sorrows. However, Jamie Bowman (James Atherton), and his friend, Lee, burst into the restaurant and violently attack Carla. Tracy, hearing the commotion, leaves Carla to the mercy of the thugs, feeling envious over Carla's liaison with Robert. After realising that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> in the restaurant, Jamie grabs Carla's handbag, causing her to fall over. She rises to her feet abruptly and gives chase. She jumps into the car, leaving the door wide open, wrestling with the thugs for her handbag. As the car drives out of the street, Jamie pushes Carla out of the vehicle, knocking her unconscious. She survived and Tracy pressures her to persuade Nick to sell the Bistro. He eventually sells to Robert, and Carla and Nick make plans to move to Devon.|$|E

When {{attempting}} to buy several disguises, they briefly meet Camorristi Firo Prochainezo and Maiza Avaro and befriend the homunculus [...] Ennis, instilling her with confidence and hope. They decide to rob {{the very small}} Martillo and Gandor families. The pair sneak into the Martillo's speakeasy, the Alveare, to scout the area, and while {{they are in the}} storage room, Isaac is nearly killed by a ceremonial gunshot from Firo's caporegime inauguration downstairs. Firo and Maiza respond to Miria's scream for help, and the couple are invited to the celebration as an apology. Shortly afterward, they leave to investigate the Gandor headquarters. Believing it contains money, they steal a box. However, they find a bottle of immortality elixir inside, which they mistake for alcohol. Disappointed there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>money,</b> they give the bottle to the Martillo thank them for their kindness. This prompts the immortal Szilard Quates, who owns the elixir and created Ennis, to attack the Alveare to retrieve the elixir. He orders Ennis to kill Isaac and Miria, but she attacks Szilard instead. When he is about to kill her, Isaac and Miria defend her, buying enough time for another immortal to devour Szilard, the only way to kill an immortal. It is later discovered that the immortality elixir was not in the bottle the duo stole. Firo, not realizing what it was, had stolen it earlier and distributed it at the celebration, bestowing immortality and eternal youth on all the guests, including Isaac and Miria. In the anime series, the bottle the pair stole is truly the immortality elixir and they inadvertently distribute it at the party as a gesture of thanks toward the Martillo. Afterward, the two travel to California and search for gold.|$|E

500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, {{how they feel about}} it... It’s amazing that they have such a connection but they seem to act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E
500|$|Avatars {{of famous}} musicians {{are part of}} the game, {{performing}} for songs by that artist and available as unlockable characters. Notably, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana is a playable avatar; Activision had sought to gain permission to use Cobain's image for the game for three years, including obtaining the necessary agreements with Courtney Love, who controls Cobain's estate, and Dave Grohl and Universal Publishing, who control Nirvana's catalog. Cobain's avatar was designed with input from Love, who provided photos and videos for the design team to use, and emphasized how she would like Cobain to appear, starting from his appearance in [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] and modifying it from there. The avatar includes the T-shirt design based on Daniel Johnston's [...] "Frog" [...] that Cobain had popularized. Johnny Cash is also a playable character, with tribute artist Terry Lee Goffee helping to provide motion capture for his character. Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson (of Garbage), and Matthew Bellamy (of Muse) are also playable avatars, all of whom performed motion capture for their own avatars. There are also unlockable fictional characters like Skeleton, Golden God, Shadow, Frankenrocker, and Gerald Contest Winner. Though Activision approached Jon Bon Jovi to appear in the game, Bon Jovi turned down the offer. [...] While the standard character creator is available for all versions of the game, the Xbox 360 version allows players to import their Xbox Live Avatar into the game, while the Freestyle mode on the Wii version of the game allows use of the players' Miis in the game. Nine of the characters from previous installments return in this game. They all have a costume that they start with and 3 more can be unlocked by completing challenges. Doing this will unlock also new pieces of clothing for the costume to use for user generated rockers. Also, while Gibson no longer sponsors the game, other guitar manufacturers, like Ibanez, ESP, Paul Reed Smith and Schecter, lent the likenesses of their instruments, allowing for new combinations on assembling custom guitars and basses. For the first time, also, sponsored clothing pieces can be used in customization (these being shoes from Vans, Dr. Martens and Converse) There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> in the game leaving everything available to use, including unlockables. Instruments can also be unlocked to use. Also some clothing now can be changed in style. There are four styles for each; the one shown, two others that were separate items in previous games (with exceptions), and one new one (with exceptions). Pregenerated characters outfits can only be changed and users can only decide which outfit they wear. However they can still edit their instruments. Virtual avatars of the real life rockers can also not be changed in any way, including instruments.|$|E
