40|$|This paper proposes omnibus and <b>directional</b> <b>tests</b> {{for testing}} the goodness-of-fit of a {{parametric}} regression time series model. We use a general class of residual marked empirical processes as the building-blocks for estimation {{and testing of}} such models.

To approximate the asymptotic null distribution of test statistics we justify theoretically a bootstrap procedure. Also, some asymptotic theory for the estimation of the principal components of the residual marked processes is considered. This asymptotic theory is used to derive optimal <b>directional</b> <b>tests</b> and efficient estimation of regression parameters.

40|$|A common {{statistical}} problem {{involves the}} testing of a "K"-dimensional parameter vector. In both parametric and semiparametric settings, two types of directional tests - linear combination and constrained tests - are frequently used instead of omnibus tests in hopes of achieving greater power for specific alternatives. In this paper, we consider {{the relationship between these}} directional tests, as well as their relationship to omnibus tests. Every constrained <b>directional</b> <b>test</b> is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to a specific linear combination test under a sequence of contiguous alternatives and vice versa. Even when the direction of the alternative is known, the constrained test in general will not be optimal unless the objective function used to derive it is efficient. For an arbitrary alternative, insight into the power characteristics of directional tests in comparison to omnibus tests can be gained by a chi-square partition of the omnibus test.

40|$|Model {{selection}} for marginal regression analysis of longitudinal data is challeng-ing {{due to the}} presence of correlation and the difficulty of specifying the full like-lihood, particularly for correlated categorical data. This paper introduces a novel BIC-type model selection criterion based on the quadratic inference function (Qu, Lindsay and Li, 2000), which does not require the full likelihood or quasilikelihood. With probability approaching one, the criterion selects the most parsimonious cor-rect model. Although a working correlation matrix is assumed, {{there is no need to}} estimate the nuisance parameters in the working correlation matrix; moreover, the model selection procedure is robust against the misspecification of the working correlation matrix. The BIC-type criterion can also be used to construct a data-driven Neyman smooth test for checking the goodness-of-fit of a postulated model. This test is especially useful and often yields much higher power in situations where the classical <b>directional</b> <b>test</b> behaves poorly. The finite sample performance of the model selection and model checking procedures is demonstrated through Monte Carlo studies and analysis of a clinical trial data set.

40|$|Local {{canonical}} correlation analysis (CCA) is a multivariate method {{that has been}} proposed to more accurately determine activation patterns in fMRI data. In its conventional formulation, CCA has several drawbacks that limit its usefulness in fMRI. A major drawback is that, unlike the general linear model (GLM), a test of general linear contrasts of the temporal regressors has not been incorporated into the CCA formalism. To overcome this drawback, a novel <b>directional</b> <b>test</b> statistic was derived using the equivalence of multivariate multiple regression (MVMR) and CCA. This extension will allow CCA {{to be used for}} inference of general linear contrasts in more complicated fMRI designs without reparameterization of the design matrix and without reestimating the CCA solutions for each particular contrast of interest. With the proper constraints on the spatial coefficients of CCA, this test statistic can yield a more powerful test on the inference of evoked brain regional activations from noisy fMRI data than the conventional t-test in the GLM. The quantitative results from simulated and pseudoreal data and activation maps from fMRI data were used to demonstrate the advantage of this novel test statistic...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analysed}} {{the relationship}} between primate mating system, size and size dimorphism by utilizing several phylogenetically based methods. An independent contrast analysis {{of male and female}} size (log weight) showed that these are tightly correlated and that size dimorphism is not a simple allometric function of size. We found no relationship between mating system and sexual dimorphism in strepsirhines but a strong relationship in haplorhines. By matched-pairs analysis, where sister groups were matched according to whether the mating system predicted higher or lower intrasexual selection for male size, haplorhine species in more polygynous clades (with a predicted higher sexual selection) were significantly more dimorphic, had larger males, and also, but to a lesser degree, larger females. Both independent contrast and matched-pairs analyses are non-directional and correlational. By using a <b>directional</b> <b>test</b> we investigated how a transition in mating system affects size and dimorphism. Here, each observation is the sum of changes in dimorphism or size in a clade that is defined by a common origin of a mating system.

METHODS: Sixteen volunteers were divided into a control (CN; 4 men and 2 women) and training group (TR; 6 men and 4 women). Laboratory measures included maximal aerobic power (VO 2 max), submaximal oxygen uptake (10. 5 percent or 6 degrees treadmill inclination) and accumulated oxygen deficit (AOD). Performance was assessed during 20 metre shuttle run tests (PST, progressive shuttle run test; HIST, high intensity shuttle run test). RESULTS: TR improved their HIST performance (m) significantly compared with CN, identified by a significant "group-by-training" interaction (p< 0. 01). Similarly, AOD values improved more in TR compared with CN (p< 0. 01). There was a trend for TR to further reduce blood pH values after training compared with CN, although this decrease (approximately 0. 05 units) did not attain statistical significance. The change in AOD was strongly correlated with the change in run time to exhaustion (r= 0. 76, p< 0. 01) and the change in estimated total work output (r= 0. 69, p< 0. 01) during 10. 5 percent gradient running and modestly correlated with the change in HIST performance (r= 0. 49, p< 0. 05, assuming a <b>directional</b> <b>test).</b> CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest changes in the anaerobic capacity, determined as AOD, due to training may be reflected in corresponding changes in laboratory and field performance...|$|E
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of pen-and-touch operated personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet computers, and wall-size displays (e. g., Liveboard and Smartboard), touch and pen input have gained popularity. Touch-based user interfaces such as mobile phones, PDAs and tablet PCs (with touch screens) have become more attractive in consumer electronics because they enable quick learning and rapid performance whilst evoking high user satisfaction. Today, countless supermarket checkouts, restaurant tills, automated-teller machines, airport check-in kiosks, museum information-booths and voting kiosks use touchscreens. Nevertheless, initial literature identified that {{the widespread use of}} a touch-based user interface has been limited by the high error rates shown in many studies, the lack of precision, the fatigue in arm motion, and the concern for screen smudging. Furthermore, most research into touch-based interaction has tended to not directly investigate efficiency, effectiveness and user satisfaction. There is therefore a need to add to the body of knowledge in this area, especially as devices using touch-based interaction are becoming more pervasive. Hence, the purpose of this research is to evaluate the usability of touch-based user interfaces in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and user satisfaction. In order to answer the question of whether a touch-based user interface is better - more effective, useful, practical and satisfying to the user -, an investigation of comparison to other, alternative interaction methods, by means of mouse, touch and stylus has been conducted. Therefore, the research sets out to concentrate on a series of empirical experiments that will be designed and developed to evaluate the efficiency, effectiveness and user satisfaction of using touchscreen interfaces. Furthermore, in order to collect the human performance data, a series of small software prototypes involving touch-based interaction were developed and designed using Adobe Flash. Initially a pilot experiment is carried out and followed by the abstract experiment and context experiment that were based on the guidance of The International Organization for Standardization known as ISO (ISO 9241 - 420, 2011). The abstract experiment consist of four tests (Tracing test, Dragging test, One direction test and Multi <b>directional</b> <b>test)</b> which are deliberately developed as abstract tasks with the purpose of analysing the user’s ability on simple tasks without a real world context. The context experiment consist of four tests as well (Tracing test, Dragging test, One direction test and Multi <b>directional</b> <b>test)</b> which are deliberately developed as contextual tasks with the purpose of analysing the user’s ability in a real world context. Overall, the aim of both abstract and context experiments was to discover if there are differences in mouse, stylus and touch on the tracing test and dragging test with different levels of difficulty that could affect users’ performance and satisfaction. The significant contribution to knowledge that may arise from this research might provoke the gaining of evidence to show if touch-based interaction is more effective and preferred by users in real-world-type tasks and scenarios. Currently there is very little evidence to indicate whether touch-based interaction is more effective and preferred by users. It seems that the proliferation of touch-based devices is market-driven rather than usability-driven. Moreover, this is the first study that has been carried out which compare three input devices (stylus, mouse and touch) in tracing, dragging, one direction tapping and multi directional tapping test for both abstract and context tasks and therefore contributes to the up-to-date HCI literature. The main strength of the current study is that it provides findings from well-designed experiment that is based on ISO standard (ISO 9241 - 420, 2011). It provided a useful guideline that can be further developed and applied to other research in this area...|$|E

Materials and Methods: Visual acuity measurement with Lea symbols and Bailey-Lovie tumbling E chart {{was performed on}} children between 3 and 6 years of age. Visual acuity data from the two charts were analyzed with Bland-Altman plot to determine the limits of agreement. The Wilcoxon signed test was performed in children aged 3 - 4 years and in children aged 5 - 6 years separately to evaluate the influence of age. The inter-eye {{difference between the two}} charts were further analyzed with the paired t-test. A p value < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 47 children were enrolled for the study. The average logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) monocular visual acuity with Lea symbols (0. 17 ± 0. 13) was better than the Bailey-Lovie tumbling E chart (0. 22 ± 0. 14). The mean difference between Bailey-Lovie tumbling E chart and Lea symbol chart was 0. 05 ± 0. 12 in logMAR units. A second analysis eliminating outliers showed the same result but lower differences (n = 43, 0. 05 ± 0. 05 logMAR units). Visual acuity results between the two charts in children aged 3 - 4 years showed a significant difference (p = 0. 000), but not for children aged 5 - 6 years (p = 0. 059). Inter-eye differences between the two charts was not statistically significant (p = 0. 77). Conclusion: Bailey-Lovie tumbling E chart is comparable to the Lea symbols chart in pre-school children.

We propose a method to construct tests that concentrate their asymptotic powers upon only such interesting alternatives.

The testing procedure can be easily modified when the main interest lies in average increment effects of binary covariates, multivariate average derivatives or linear restrictions other than those of average derivatives. Results from Monte Carlo experiments show that the asymptotic theory is a reasonable approximation of the finite-sample distributions and an application of our methods to female labor market participation illustrates the importance of this non-omnibus approach.
