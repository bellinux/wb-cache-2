5|$|Kehoe <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school {{about half}} an hour after the explosion. He saw Superintendent Huyck and summoned him over to his truck. Charles Hawson testified at the inquest that he saw the two men {{struggle}} over some type of long gun before Kehoe detonated the dynamite stored in his truck, killing himself, Superintendent Huyck, Nelson McFarren (a retired farmer), and Cleo Clayton, an eight-year-old second grader. Clayton had survived the first blast and had wandered out of the school building debris; he was killed by the fragmentation from the exploding vehicle. The explosion also mortally wounded postmaster Glenn O. Smith, who lost a leg and died later that day of his wounds, and injured several others.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of November 2, 2002, a female {{employee}} of the Camp Courtney officers' club on Okinawa <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Courtney main gate and reported to base security personnel that a Marine Corps major had just attempted to sexually assault her in her car on a deserted road near the back gate of the base. She identified the Marine as Major Michael Brown and stated that during the assault the major threw her mobile phone into the nearby Tengan River. The woman, later identified with the initials V.N., who was 40 years old, and originally from the Philippines, had lived in Okinawa for 17 years, and was married to a Japanese citizen of Okinawan descent. She reported that she had picked up Brown in her car about 1:30a.m. after the officers' club closed and that he directed her to the deserted road behind the base and after parking, Brown tried to rape her and then threw her mobile phone into the river when she tried to call the police. The Camp Courtney security personnel called the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA). Japanese officers came and took V. N.'s report.|$|E
25|$|Graham Sutherland, who {{had just}} been shot at in his car, {{reversed}} back up the road and drove to the service station close by, where he tried to inform people what was happening. Bryant <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> service station and cut off a white Toyota Corolla that was attempting to exit onto the highway. Glenn Pears was driving, with girlfriend Zoe Hall in the passenger seat. Bryant quickly exited the car with his rifle in hand and tried to pull Hall from the car. Pears {{got out of the car}} and approached Bryant. Bryant pointed the gun at Pears and pushed him backwards, eventually directing him into the now open boot of the BMW, locking Pears inside.|$|E

60|$|He {{stopped the}} vehicle {{at the lodge}} gate, had his baggage taken out there, and {{proceeded}} on foot towards the Hall, for he was afraid that, if he <b>drove</b> straight <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, the sudden delight of seeing him {{would be too much}} for his mother.|$|R
25|$|Russell Garcia - Garcia is from Oakland, California {{and is a}} {{composer}} {{who has worked with}} major Hollywood artists and producers. Garcia and his wife Gina have been members of the Bahá'í Faith since 1955. In 1966 they set sail and ended up in the south Pacific when some musicians from Auckland, New Zealand invited Russell to do some live concerts, radio and television shows and to lecture at the various universities around the country on behalf of the New Zealand Broadcasting Commission and Music Trades Association. Russell, finished with his lectures and concerts and on advice of friends, <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bay of Islands in the north of North Island where they live.|$|E
25|$|Häkkinen again {{remained}} at McLaren for 1997 and Coulthard remained his teammate. Häkkinen's season {{got off to}} a good start: In the season opening race in Australia, he <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third position and later managed to score further consecutive finishes inside of the points scoring positions in the next three races. He suffered his first retirement of the season at the Monaco Grand Prix when he was involved in a collision with Benetton driver Jean Alesi. Häkkinen later managed to take ninth position at the Spanish Grand Prix, but later suffered three consecutive retirements in the next three races—a collision with Ferrari driver Eddie Irvine in Canada and engine failures in France and Britain. At the latter race, he had seemed set for his first win, but his engine blew while he was holding off eventual winner Jacques Villeneuve.|$|E
25|$|Bryant <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> toll booth, {{where there}} were several vehicles, and blocked a BMW owned by Mary Rose Nixon. Inside were Nixon, driver Russell James Pollard and {{passengers}} Helene and Robert Graham Salzmann. An argument with Robert Salzmann ensued, and Bryant took out the FAL and shot Salzmann at point-blank range, killing him. Pollard emerged from the BMW and went towards Bryant, who {{shot him in the}} chest, killing him. More cars then arrived, but seeing this, the drivers were quickly able to reverse back up the road. Bryant then moved to the BMW and pulled Nixon and Helene Salzmann from the car and shot them dead, dragging their bodies onto the road. Bryant transferred ammunition, handcuffs, the AR-15 rifle and a fuel container to the BMW. Mary Nixon, Russell Pollard, Helene Salzmann and Robert Salzmann are the people Bryant was charged with killing at the toll booth.|$|E

2500|$|Oakville is {{the last}} town on the Iowa River before it empties into the Mississippi. The {{authorities}} believed {{it would be in}} danger when the river crested and had issued an evacuation order to take effect on Monday, June 16. However, in the early morning of June 14 a river levee near the town failed catastrophically, resulting in an immediate emergency evacuation order. In , the mayor of Oakville recounted that she was in the town hall when a National Guard vehicle <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> building and a Guardsman got out and started shouting, [...] "The levee's going, get out, get out now." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{appears that}} after {{exploding}} a small {{bomb in the}} street, presumably as a diversionary measure—this did virtually no damage—a lorry <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tradesmen's entrance of the King David Hotel and the occupants, after holding up the staff at pistol point, entered the kitchen premises carrying a number of milk cans. At some stage of the proceedings, they shot and seriously wounded a British soldier who attempted to interfere with them. All available information so far is {{to the effect that}} they were Jews. Somewhere {{in the basement of the}} hotel they planted bombs which went off shortly afterwards. They appear to have made good their escape." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{about half}} mile past Crenshaw Crossing at Moake Crossing, McDowell was already bloodied and limping, {{unable to walk}} any further. A union man told him, [...] "I'm {{going to kill you}} and use you for bait to catch the other men." [...] He and another man grabbed McDowell and led him down a side road. Gunshots were heard, and the rest {{continued}} towards Herrin. A farmer later discovered McDowell's body. He had been shot four times – twice in the stomach, and once each in the chest and head. [...] A car <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> procession, and a man came out whom some said they overheard being called [...] "Hugh Willis" [...] and [...] "the president." [...] According to the accounts of surviving captives, Willis said, [...] "Listen, don't you go killing these fellows on a public highway. There are too many women and children and witnesses around to do that. Take them over in the woods and give it to them. Kill all you can." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time Park saw Kaelin come {{from the back of}} the {{property}} to the front, Park testified that he saw [...] "a tall black man" [...] of Simpson's height and build enter the front door of the house from the driveway area, after which lights were turned on and Simpson finally answered Park's call. Simpson explained that he had overslept and would be at the front gate soon. Kaelin opened the Ashford gate to let Park drive the limo onto the estate grounds, and Simpson came out of his house through the front door a few minutes later. Both Kaelin and Park helped Simpson put his belongings (which were already outside the front door when Park <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front of Simpson's house) into the trunk of the limo for the ride to the airport. Both Kaelin and Park remarked in their testimony that Simpson looked agitated. But other witnesses, including the ticket clerk at Los Angeles International Airport who checked Simpson onto the plane and a flight attendant, said that Simpson looked and acted perfectly normal. Conflicting testimony such as this was to be a recurring theme throughout the trial.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{ignored the}} protests for six months, but on June20,1917, as a Russian {{delegation}} <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> White House, suffragists unfurled a banner which stated: [...] "We women of America {{tell you that}} America is not a democracy. Twentymillion women are {{denied the right to}} vote. President Wilson is the chief opponent of their national enfranchisement". Another banner on August14,1917, referred to [...] "Kaiser Wilson" [...] and compared the plight of the German people with that of American women. With this manner of protest, the women were subject to arrests and many were jailed. Another ongoing tactic of the National Woman's Party was watchfires, which involved burning copies of President Wilson's speeches, often outside the White House or in the nearby Lafayette Park. The Party continued to hold watchfires even as the war began, drawing criticism from the public and even other suffrage groups for being unpatriotic. On October17, Alice Paul was sentenced to seven months and on October30 began a hunger strike, but after a few days prison authorities began to force feed her. After years of opposition, Wilson changed his position in 1918 to advocate women's suffrage as a war measure.|$|E
2500|$|On the 5th Bavarian Division front the {{bombardment}} increased on 14 September, causing many casualties, cutting most telephone lines and destroying the front trenches until an overnight lull. The bombardment resumed {{early in the}} morning including gas shells and before dawn a thick mist rose, which with the gas and smoke, reduced visibility and around [...] troops of Bavarian Infantry Regiment 21 (BIR 21) near Ginchy were surprised to see three vehicles emerge from the mist, manoeuvring round shell-craters. The vehicles, with blue-and-white crosses, were thought to be for transporting wounded. Machine-gun fire was received from them and the Bavarians returned fire but the vehicles <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge of the trench and fired along it for several minutes. The vehicles drove away, one being hit by a shell and abandoned in no man's land. Soon afterwards a creeping barrage began to move towards the German defences and the German artillery reply was considered by survivors to be feeble. A wounded officer returning for treatment found that the batteries around Flers and Gueuedecourt did not know that the British were attacking because the telephone lines had been cut and visual signals had not been seen in the smoke and mist.|$|E

Al-Ahmadi was shot multiple times and {{was found dead in}} his suburb of Mithaq, located in Eastern Mosul, Iraq. Al-Ahmadi's body was taken to Mosul's department of forensic medicine. As with all the other cases of killed journalists in Iraq since 2003, the perpetrators have not been brought to justice.|$|R

2500|$|Alpha and Bravo Company, both of 8 Platoon, 1 Para, {{arrived in}} Majar al-Kabir at 9:25am on 24 June with the {{intention}} of carrying out foot patrols through the town. Before leaving, Lieutenant Ross Kennedy (the Officer in Command (OIC) of the two companies) asked for more baton rounds (plastic bullets) for his baton gun. The request was denied as all the spare rounds were packed away before the Parachute Regiment left the area to return to the UK in seven days time. This left his two patrols (Alpha and Bravo) with only 13 baton rounds. At just after 10:00am local time, the local Iraqi militia commander (Talal Abid Ahmed Zubaida) <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patrol and stopped them from going further. Zubaida told them that the town was dangerous and that they would be shot at. Lieutenant Kennedy offered to change the route of the patrol, but Zubaida warned him that the route was an issue too and that if he went into the town, {{it would have to be}} without Zubaida's militia. The British managed to negotiate a vehicle-mounted patrol through the town as a compromise with Zubaida. Alpha Company would remain at the Militia headquarters with other vehicles whilst the Iraqi Militia would accompany Bravo, mounted on Pinzgauers, on a patrol through the town; the British felt that not to have patrolled would be a sign of weakness. At 10:10am, Bravo company entered the town and almost immediately were showered with rocks thrown by [...] "smiling locals." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the right}} flank of XIV Corps, the 169th Brigade (Brigadier-General E. S. D'E. Coke) of the 56th Division was to capture Loop Trench across the Combles ravine from Reserve Infantry Regiment 28 of the 185th Division and keep {{contact with the}} French in the valley. During the night, a {{battalion}} dug jumping-off trenches parallel to Combles Trench below Leuze Wood and a tank <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corner of the wood by dawn. The tank set off again just before [...] to reach the objective with the infantry and after twenty minutes the creeping barrage began. Infantry advanced with the right wing aiming at the junction of Combles and Loop trenches and escaped a German counter-barrage which was late and easily reached the objective. The tank was a great shock to the defenders and greatly assisted the attack. The attackers were now to swing right to capture Loop Trench and the Loop but crossfire from German machine-guns prevented this and the British began to bomb up Loop Trench and down Combles Trench, which took all day and was reinforced by another battalion and a party of bombers. The tank was knocked out near the Loop but the crew held off German bombers, inflicting many casualties, until it was set on fire five hours later and abandoned. When night fell, a trench block {{was set up in}} Combles Trench beyond the junction but in the Loop the British were [...] short of the sunken road and an attack at [...] failed.|$|E

60|$|He {{changed his}} {{position}} to a vertical one. He {{glanced up at}} the quiet stars, at the same time emptying his lungs of air. With swift, vigorous propulsion of hands and feet, he lifted his shoulders and half his chest out of water. This was to gain impetus for the descent. Then he let himself go and sank without movement, a white statue, into the sea. He breathed in the water deeply, deliberately, after the manner of a man taking an anaesthetic. When he strangled, quite involuntarily his arms and legs clawed the water and <b>drove</b> him <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface and into the clear sight of the stars.|$|R
