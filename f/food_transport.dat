25|$|Protecting {{agricultural}} land reserves also {{play an important}} part in the charter of sustainability. The idea behind the {{agricultural land}} reserves is to encourage and increase the role of urban agriculture thus reducing the reliance of <b>food</b> <b>transport</b> and increasing the quality and availability of food to local people. The Charter takes the idea one step further by bringing in value adding food processing agribusiness to complete the supply chain circle.|$|E
25|$|Workers {{lower in}} the {{hierarchy}} forage individually for food items on the substrate and do not recruit other nestmates to assist with <b>food</b> <b>transport.</b> Although foraging workers do not recruit nestmates, Nascimento et al. (2012) found a positive feedback between incoming food and stimulation of new foragers as well as task partitioning once food was brought into the nest. Lower ranking females processed protein resources while higher ranking females handled small food pieces and distributed them to the larvae. Fourcassié & Oliviera (2002) found Dinoponera gigantea foraging to be concentrated {{in the early morning}} and afternoon but did not sample at night. Morgan (1993) observed the highest activity at night in Dinoponera longipes. Dinoponera quadriceps has a marked seasonal pattern in activity. It is most active in May–August, the late rainy season to early dry season in the semiarid Caatinga. Activity was strongly negatively correlated to temperature and positively correlated to prey abundance. The diets of both Dinoponera gigantea and Dinoponera quadriceps {{have been shown to be}} predominantly scavenged invertebrates, but include live prey, seeds and fruits. Araújo & Rodrigues (2006) state that the taxonomic diversity of prey is comparable to other tropical ponerines, but has an optimal prey size of 2–3cm in Dinoponera. Diet seems to be very similar across the genus, regardless of habitat.|$|E
50|$|The {{refrigeration}} system used to <b>transport</b> <b>food</b> {{is based on}} vapor compression that ensures the maintenance of certain conditions such as temperature in function of the quantity and type of <b>food</b> <b>transported.</b> The units that use this technique can work at full thus allowing controlled transport of refrigerated loads.|$|R

2500|$|Foragers collect {{food that}} {{is around the}} nesting area {{and bring it back}} to the colony to share with the other ants. [...] T. sessile has polydomous colonies, meaning that one colony has {{multiple}} nests. Because of this, T. sessile is very good at foraging for food when there is great variance in the distribution of resources. Instead of going back to a faraway nest to deliver food, they move workers, queens, and the brood to be closer to the food, so that they can reduce <b>food</b> <b>transport</b> cost. This is called 'dispersed central-place foraging'. It was also found that the nest half-life was about 12.9 days.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} food miles {{is part of}} the broader issue of {{sustainability}} which deals with a large range of environmental, social and economic issues, including local food. The term was coined by Tim Lang (now Professor of Food Policy, City University, London) who says: [...] "The point was to highlight the hidden ecological, social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way, one which had objective reality but also connotations." [...] The increased distance traveled by food in developed countries was caused by the globilization of food trade, which increased by 4 times since 1961. Food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food. Road transport produces 60% of the world's <b>food</b> <b>transport</b> carbon emissions. Air transport produces 20% of the world's <b>food</b> <b>transport</b> carbon emissions. Rail and sea transport produce 10% each of the world's <b>food</b> <b>transport</b> carbon emissions.|$|E
