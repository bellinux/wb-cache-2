40|$|This article {{examines}} the behavior and performance of speculators and <b>hedgers</b> in 15 U. S. futures markets. We find that after controlling for market risk factors, speculators are contrarians, but respond positively to market sentiment. In contrast, <b>hedgers</b> engage in positive feedback trading and trade against market sentiment. We also find that trades of speculators (<b>hedgers)</b> are positively (negatively) correlated with subsequent abnormal returns; however, {{it does not appear}} that speculators possess superior forecasting power. Therefore, hedging pressure effects likely explain the negative relation between the performance of speculators and <b>hedgers.</b> The positive feedback trading by <b>hedgers</b> together with their negative performance suggests that <b>hedgers</b> have a destabilizing impact on futures prices. ...|$|R

25|$|Press {{accounts}} in January 2016 indicated that Department of Defense staff were reviewing Department of Justice {{documents from the}} Petraeus prosecution and considering whether to recommend to the Secretary of Defense that Petraeus be demoted on the Army's retired list. Laws and regulations indicate {{that members of the}} military are retired at the last rank in which they are deemed to have served successfully; Petraeus' admission of an extramarital affair and guilty plea with regard to removing and retaining classified information while serving in the grade of General could be grounds for reduction in rank to Lieutenant General. The matter was reviewed by then-Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh before he left office in October 2015; he recommended no further action. On January 29, press {{accounts in}}dicated that Stephen C. <b>Hedger,</b> Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, had written to the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} the economy that splits investors into two groups. One group (the reference traders) trades an underlying asset according to the difference in realized returns between that asset and some evolving consensus estimate of those returns; the other group (<b>hedgers)</b> hedge options, namely straddles, on the underlying asset. We consider the cases when <b>hedgers</b> are long the straddle and when the <b>hedgers</b> are short the straddle. We numerically simulate the terminal distribution of the underlying asset price and find that <b>hedgers</b> that are long the straddle tend to push the underlying toward the strike, while <b>hedgers</b> that are short the straddle cause the underlying security to have a bimodal terminal probability distribution with a local minimum at the strike.

The disclosure of financial information induces a trade externality: if speculators refrain from trading, <b>hedgers</b> do the same, depressing the asset price. Market transparency reinforces this mechanism, by making speculators' trades more visible to <b>hedgers.</b> As a consequence, issuers will oppose both {{the disclosure of}} fundamentals and trading transparency.

2500|$|A typical <b>hedger</b> {{might be}} a {{commercial}} farmer. The market values of wheat and other crops fluctuate constantly as supply and demand for them vary, with [...] occasional large moves in either direction. Based on current prices and forecast levels at harvest time, the farmer might decide that planting wheat {{is a good idea}} one season, but the price of wheat might change over time. Once the farmer plants wheat, he is committed to it for an entire growing season. If the actual price of wheat rises greatly between planting and harvest, the farmer stands {{to make a lot of}} unexpected money, but if the actual price drops by harvest time, he is going to lose the invested money.|$|E

The inverse of the EIS measures the <b>hedger's</b> aversion to intertemporal variation and is distinct from aversion to risk.

40|$|The "received" view in {{the finance}} {{literature}} is that <b>hedgers</b> are uninformed traders who use futures to fix future price movements and prevent losses from unexpected and unknown fluctuations in the purchase or sale price of a commodity.

The findings show that the transition to IFRSs has affected the equity, earnings, leverage and liquidity of <b>hedgers</b> in a significantly positive manner as opposed to non-hedgers, who presented a generally significant negative change in their respective figures. <b>Hedgers</b> tend to be larger sized and exhibit higher profitability, growth, leverage and liquidity. <b>Hedgers</b> also tend to have foreign revenues, be cross-listed in foreign stock markets and audited by a Big 4 auditor.

40|$|Although {{frequent}} {{fluctuations in}} domestic hog prices seriously affect {{the stability and}} robustness of the hog supply chain, hog futures (an effective hedging instrument) have not been listed in China. To better understand hog futures market hedging, {{it is important to}} study the steady state of intersubjective bidding. This paper uses evolutionary game theory to construct a game model between <b>hedgers</b> and speculators in the hog futures market, and replicator dynamic equations are then used to obtain the steady state between the two trading entities. The results show that the steady state is one in which <b>hedgers</b> adopt a "buy" strategy and speculators adopt a "do not speculate" strategy, but this type of extreme steady state is not easily realized. Thus, to explore the rational proportion of <b>hedgers</b> and speculators in the evolutionary stabilization strategy, bidding processes were simulated using weekly average hog prices from 2006 to 2015, such that the conditions under which <b>hedgers</b> and speculators achieve a steady state could be analyzed. This task was performed to achieve the stability critical point, and we show that only when the value of λ is satisfied and the conditions of hog futures price changes and futures price are satisfied can <b>hedgers</b> and speculators achieve a rational proportion and a stable hog futures market. This market can thus provide a valuable reference {{for the development of the}} Chinese hog futures market and the formulation and guidance of relevant departmental policies...|$|R
