40|$|BACKGROUND: Performance {{feedback}} or <b>debriefing</b> {{in surgery}} is increasingly {{recognized as an}} essential means to optimize learning {{in the operating room}} (OR). However, {{there is a lack of}} evidence regarding the current practice and barriers to <b>debriefing</b> in the OR. METHODS: Phase 1 consisted of semistructured interviews with surgical trainers and trainees to identify features of an effective <b>debriefing</b> and perceived barriers to <b>debriefing.</b> Phase 2 consisted of ethnographic observations of surgical cases to identify current practice and observed barriers to <b>debriefing.</b> RESULTS: Surgical trainers and trainees identified key features of effective <b>debriefing</b> with regard to the approach and content; however, these were not commonly identified in practice. Culture was recognized as a significant barrier to <b>debriefing</b> across both phases of the study. CONCLUSIONS: There is a disparity between what the surgical community views as effective <b>debriefing</b> and actual <b>debriefing</b> practices in the OR. Improvements to the current <b>debriefing</b> culture and practice within the field of surgery should be considered to facilitate learning from clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|<b>Debriefing,</b> the {{reflective}} activity following an experiential learning exercise, {{has been identified}} as {{the most important part of}} simulation learning and is also important for learning in other activities utilized in nursing education. There is general agreement that <b>debriefing</b> provides learning and improves performance. However, there is little specific evidence about the phenomenon of learning acquired during <b>debriefing,</b> including how it occurs, how it is defined and identified, and how it is evaluated by <b>debriefing</b> facilitators. In addition, there are no instruments or tools specifically measuring learning acquired during <b>debriefing.</b> Without practical and theoretically grounded tools, simulation activities will continue to lack the element of objective assessment necessary to move evidence-based teaching practices forward. A measure of learning acquired during <b>debriefing,</b> independent of a specific <b>debriefing</b> method and across <b>debriefing</b> types, will aid in the design of future simulation <b>debriefing</b> research that is both rigorous and feasible. To inform future tool development, I conducted a qualitative descriptive study to provide initial evidence regarding the learning acquired during <b>debriefing.</b> Following Institutional Review Board approval, I conducted 17 semi-structured interviews of nurse educators who facilitate <b>debriefing</b> in pre-licensure nursing programs. The interviews were transcribed and data analysis was completed to provide answers to the research questions using simple descriptive statistics, inductive reasoning processes and content analysis to interpret and structure meaning from the interviews. Study results included the nurse educators’ verbatim definitions of learning as well as simple descriptions of how they measured the learning acquired during <b>debriefing.</b> Qualitative themes emerging from the interviews describe how nurse educators recognize when students are learning during debriefing; these themes also describe activities that the nurse educators used to promote student learning during <b>debriefing.</b> Nurse educators identified that nursing students are learning during <b>debriefing</b> when they express what they have learned directly, connect past and present learning, plan for future practice experiences, share with peers, experience the “Ah-ha” moment, critically review their actions, display excitement and engagement during <b>debriefing,</b> apply their simulation learning in subsequent clinical and simulation experiences, and display learning in formal and informal assessments. Nurse educators described many activities they used to promote learning when they facilitated debriefings. These activities included utilizing simulation preparation activities, aligning their <b>debriefing</b> practices with a specific <b>debriefing</b> method or learning theory, utilizing intentional <b>debriefing,</b> establishing safety, maintaining a supportive demeanor, encouraging student-led <b>debriefing,</b> engaging the student learner, using <b>debriefing</b> aids, promoting recognition of learning, facilitating to the level of the learner, attending to the <b>debriefing</b> environment, and providing post-debriefing activities. I will use the results of this study to inform future development of an instrument intended to measure learning acquired during <b>debriefing.</b> This study also provides many insights into how nurse educators can facilitate learning during <b>debriefing</b> for pre-licensure nursing student...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} video-aided oral <b>debriefing</b> on task management of anesthesiologist assistant students {{through the use of}} high-fidelity anesthesia crisis simulation scenarios. This information describes an evaluation of student learning that is valuable in student educational and workplace competency. Method: A total of 18 graduate students in an anesthesiologist assistant program voluntarily participated in two anesthesia simulation scenarios separated by one of two <b>debriefing</b> methods (oral <b>debriefing</b> versus video-aided oral <b>debriefing).</b> Task management scores of the scenarios were assessed through the Anesthetists’ Nontechnical Skills system. Task management scores after the pre-intervention scenario were compared to the scores after the post-intervention scenario. The effectiveness of video-aided oral <b>debriefing</b> was studied using a within-subjects analysis. The comparison of video-aided oral <b>debriefing</b> to oral <b>debriefing</b> was examined with a between-subjects analysis. Results: The results showed a significant improvement in the intervention group from the initial assessment to the subsequent assessment in task management (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). However, results did not show a statistically significant difference between the two <b>debriefing</b> methods after a second anesthesia crisis scenario (p= 0. 21). Conclusion: The research study found that task management during anesthesia crisis scenarios improved after video-aided oral <b>debriefing.</b> No difference was found when comparing the improvement in task management between <b>debriefing</b> methods. Therefore, video-aided oral <b>debriefing</b> was comparable to oral <b>debriefing</b> in improving task management in this study...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} post-simulation <b>debriefing</b> in maritime training. For this purpose, the scope was divided into two focal areas: the process of post-simulation <b>debriefing</b> and instructions in post-simulation <b>debriefing.</b> For each focal area, three research questions have been formulated and used as a support to give the study direction. In the matter of the process of post-simulation <b>debriefing,</b> the aim of the research questions was to identify the structural components of the <b>debriefing</b> process. As for the instructions in post-simulation-debriefing, the aim was to understand how the subject was taught. Theory: The theoretical background presents a panoramic view of <b>debriefing,</b> which includes the origin and concept of <b>debriefing,</b> the process of <b>debriefing</b> as well as the critical aspects of <b>debriefing.</b> As for the origin and concept of <b>debriefing,</b> the theoretical background depicts how historical roots have shaped various concepts of <b>debriefing.</b> Subsequently, an assortment of various conceptual frameworks, models and strategies provides perspectives on the process of <b>debriefing.</b> Henceforth, the subsection titled “critical aspects of debriefing” describe crucial features of previous research. This section presents perspective on instruction, elements of <b>debriefing,</b> how concepts and elements of <b>debriefing</b> can be understood, teaching in <b>debriefing</b> and standards of best practice, leadership in <b>debriefing</b> as well as a view of the contemporary position of previous research. Method: This study chose an educational environment of maritime training using Bridge Operations Simulators. Exercises or tasks were conducted in these simulators, where the <b>debriefing</b> sessions were held after a simulation-based exercise or task. This study was an extension of a research project and focused on approximately 16 hours of video data, where each video clip was between 2 - 12 minutes, involving three instructors at different occasions and in total involved 10 - 20 students. The study had an inductive approach, used video as a data collection method and was based on an observational approach. The data material was systematically managed, where the selected data was based on the relevance of the research objectives. Subsequently, the analysis method consisted of procedures in the shape of coding and transcripts. Results: The study resulted in several findings. First, the structure of post-simulation <b>debriefing</b> in maritime training consisted of both a general process as well as a specific process. The general process included three main phases, such as the initial phase, the central phase and the final phase. In turn, each phase involved several key steps that formed the specific process of post-simulation <b>debriefing.</b> These key steps emerged as the introduction of the <b>debriefing</b> session, overviewing the simulation-based exercise, framing and defining the problem, specifying the simulation-based scenarios, problem analysis and problem solutions, key lessons and summaries, the closures of <b>debriefing</b> and finally, the purposes with and goals in <b>debriefing.</b> Despite this, during the <b>debriefing</b> process, procedures that involved instructional guidance, the contrasts between general and specific information as well as various forms of generalizations were prominent features. As a consequence, these procedures verified that the various practices, for instance, troubleshooting, evaluation and generalizations, consistently occurred. It confirmed that the key steps in post-simulation <b>debriefing</b> process, in its consecutive order, were not affirmed. Rather, the process of post-simulation <b>debriefing</b> was flexible and consisted of versatility...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW Evidence of {{suboptimal}} {{cardiopulmonary resuscitation}} (CPR) delivery in practice has driven interest in strategies to improve CPR quality. Early {{data suggest that}} <b>debriefing</b> may be an effective strategy. In this review, we analyse types of <b>debriefing</b> and the evidence to support their usage. RECENT FINDINGS There is {{a general lack of}} standardization in terminology and methods used for <b>debriefing</b> that limits evaluation. <b>Debriefing</b> interventions generally take two different formats. Hot <b>debriefing</b> is one where individuals or teams are provided with <b>debriefing</b> immediately after the event. Although perhaps the most widely used and easiest to implement, research evidence for its effectiveness is scant. Cold <b>debriefing,</b> where individuals or teams are provided with feedback sometime after the event, is associated with improvements in process and patient outcomes. Such feedback usually involves the use of objective performance data, such as defibrillator downloads or videotape records. Before and after cohort studies have found that both verbal <b>debriefing</b> in groups and individual written feedback seem to be associated with an improvement in performance. SUMMARY <b>Debriefing</b> is a useful strategy to improve resuscitation performance, but the optimal delivery method remains unclear. Future high-quality research is required to identify the most effective form of <b>debriefing...</b>|$|R

MethodsQualitative study based on telephone <b>debriefing</b> to bystanders and interviews with bystanders who received <b>debriefing.</b> Data was analyzed using the phenomenological approach. ResultsSix themes emerged from analysis of <b>debriefing</b> audio files: (1) identification of OHCA; (2) emotional and perceptual experience with OHCA; (3) collaboration with healthcare professionals; (4) patients outcome; (5) coping with the experience and (6) general reflections. When evaluating the concept, bystanders expressed positive short term effect of receiving <b>debriefing</b> and a retention of this effect after two months. Recommendations for a future <b>debriefing</b> concept were given. ConclusionDebriefing by emergency medical dispatchers to OHCA bystanders stimulates reflection, positively influencing the {{ability to cope with}} the emotional reactions and the cognitive perception of own performance and motivates improvement of CPR skills. Importantly, it increases confidence to provide CPR in the future.

40|$|Early {{data from}} North America {{supports}} {{the use of}} educational cardiac arrest <b>debriefing</b> as a strategy {{to improve the quality}} of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the hospital setting. As some <b>debriefing</b> approaches are challenging to deliver in the NHS setting, there was a need to develop <b>debriefing</b> approaches that are both effective and suited to NHS working practices. This thesis is modelled on the Medical Research Council framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions. Undertaken between October 2011 and January 2015, it describes the development and feasibility assessment of three cardiac arrest <b>debriefing</b> approaches, which were specifically designed to be deliverable in NHS hospitals. Development work comprised three work packages (systematic review, process evaluation, qualitative study). These studies provided evidence to support the use of cardiac arrest <b>debriefing,</b> but showed that weekly group <b>debriefing</b> is undeliverable in many NHS hospitals. Through qualitative work, I identified six distinct mechanisms by which <b>debriefing</b> may affect clinical practice. Synthesis of these data led to the development of three cardiac arrest <b>debriefing</b> approaches (monthly group <b>debriefing,</b> individual oral <b>debriefing,</b> written feedback). We tested the feasibility of delivering these interventions by implementing them in three NHS hospitals (one intervention per hospital). In a before/after study, it was demonstrated that, despite practical challenges, interventions were deliverable in NHS hospitals. However, they were found to have no effect on either CPR quality or patient outcome. This finding was attributed to high performance in study hospitals at baseline. This thesis demonstrates that the developed cardiac arrest <b>debriefing</b> interventions are deliverable in NHS hospitals. It has also generated important new theory about the mechanisms by which <b>debriefing</b> may affect clinical practice. This thesis lays the foundation for future work to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of these cardiac arrest <b>debriefing</b> interventions...|$|R
