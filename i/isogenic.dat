The virus causes a very mild immune response, lending further support to its apparent lack of pathogenicity. Gene therapy vectors using AAV can infect both dividing and quiescent cells and persist in an extrachromosomal state without integrating into the genome of the host cell, although in the native virus some integration of virally carried genes into the host genome does occur. These features make AAV a very attractive candidate for creating viral vectors for gene therapy, and {{for the creation of}} <b>isogenic</b> human disease models.

'Heterosis without hybridity' {{effects on}} plant size have been {{demonstrated}} in genetically <b>isogenic</b> F1 triploid (autopolyploid) plants, where paternal genome excess F1 triploids display positive heterosis, whereas maternal genome excess F1s display negative heterosis effects.

It {{has been shown that}} hybrid vigor in an allopolyploid hybrid of two Arabidopsis species was due to epigenetic control in the upstream regions of two genes, which caused major downstream alteration in chlorophyll and starch accumulation.

50|$|<b>Isogenic</b> {{cell lines}} are created via {{a process called}} {{homologous}} gene-targeting. Targeting vectors that utilize homologous recombination are the tools or techniques {{that are used to}} knock-in or knock-out the desired disease-causing mutation or SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) to be studied. Although disease mutations can be harvested directly from cancer patients, these cells usually contain many background mutations in addition to the specific mutation of interest, and a matched normal cell line is typically not obtained. Subsequently, targeting vectors are used to 'knock-in' or 'knock out' gene mutations enabling a switch in both directions; from a normal to cancer genotype; or vice versa; in characterized human cancer cell lines such as HCT116 or Nalm6.|$|E
50|$|Susan Lindquist {{has shown}} that <b>isogenic</b> populations of yeast can express {{different}} phenotypes based on whether they had the prion form of Sup35p or the non-prion form. She did an experiment where seven strains of yeast with different genetic backgrounds were grown under many different stressful conditions, with matched PSI+ and psi- strains. In some cases, the PSI+ version grew faster, in others psi- grew faster. She proposed that PSI+ may act as an evolutionary capacitor to facilitate adaptation by releasing cryptic genetic variation in natural populations at times of stress. This variation would lie beyond stop codons, which show {{a high rate of}} in-frame loss in yeast. Mathematical models suggest that PSI+ may have evolved for this function.|$|E

With the genetic distances known predictions can be made for the best combinations concerning the two foreign genotypes carrying gene Lr37, VPMI and RL6081 and local South African cultivars.

The gene will also be transferred with the least amount of backcrosses to cultivars genetically closest to each other, generation similar genetic offspring to the recurrent parent, but with gene Lr37, Genetic distances between near <b>isogenic</b> lines (NILs) for a particular gene will also give an indication of how many loci, amplified with molecular techniques, need to be compared in order to locate putative markers linked to the gene.|$|E
50|$|Mother's curse {{predicts that}} mtDNA {{mutations}} pose a greater threat on males and male-specific detrimental mutations in mtDNA could be maintained and reach a high frequency. Several researches support these predictions. In humans, a mtDNA haplogroup that exhibits reduction in sperm mobility reaches a frequency of 20%. In Drosophila melanogaster, mtDNA polymorphism mainly affects nuclear gene expression in males {{but not in}} females and those genes are predominantly male-biased. Moreover, Camus et al. constructed 13 D. melanogaster lines with <b>isogenic</b> nuclear genome and different mtDNA haplotypes. They demonstrated that mtDNA polymorphism is responsible for male aging, {{while there is no}} significant effect on female longevity. Smith et al. analyzed two different halpotype of mtDNA in hares and found that males of those two haplogroups show variation in their reproductive success. In addition, the mitochondrial genome is associated with sperm viability and length in seed beetles (Callosobruchus maculatus).|$|E
5000|$|Experimental results {{validate}} the dominance and {{persistence of the}} ASF in the colonized mice even after four generations. The mice can be treated in the same standards as germfree mice, such as sterilized water, germfree environment, and careful handling. Although this ensures the definite ASF propagation in mice intestine, it is labor-intensive and not a good representation of physiological conditions. ASF mice can also be raised in the same conditions as normal mice, because they have addressed the immunological, pathological, and physiological weaknesses of the germfree mice. ASF mice can maintain the eight bacteria species under normal conditions. However, variations in strains of the bacteria and introduction of minor amounts of other commensal or pathogen could occur over time. <b>Isogenic</b> mice that cohabit showed little variation in ASF profile, while litter split among different cages showed divergence in bacteria strains. Once the ASF community are established though, it is highly stable over time without environmental or housing perturbation ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{bursting}} phenomenon, {{as opposed}} to simple probabilistic models of transcription, can account for the high variability (see transcriptional noise) in gene expression occurring between cells in <b>isogenic</b> populations. This variability in turn can have tremendous consequences on cell behaviour, and must be mitigated or integrated. Suggested mechanisms by which noise can be dampened include strong extracellular signalling, diffusion of RNA and protein in cell syncitia, promoter proximal pausing, and nuclear retention of transcripts. [...] In certain contexts, such as the survival of microbes in rapidly changing stressful environments, the expression variability may be essential. [...] Variability also impacts upon the effectiveness of clinical treatment, with resistance of bacteria to antibiotics demonstrably caused by non-genetic differences. [...] Similar phenomena {{may contribute to the}} resistance of sub-populations of cancer cells to chemotherapy. [...] Spontaneous variability in gene expression is also proposed to act as a source of cell fate diversity in self-organizing differentiation processes, and may act as a barrier to effective cellular reprogramming strategies.|$|E
