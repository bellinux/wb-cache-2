5|$|The {{silver dollar}} {{had never been}} a popular coin, {{circulating}} little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The Peace dollar, the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of silver certificates. This caused shortages of silver <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.|$|E

Odwalla went public in December 1993 (NASDAQ:ODWA); the company had 35 delivery trucks, almost 200 employees, and made about $13million a year. Soon afterwards, Odwalla expanded into new markets when it bought two companies in the Pacific Northwest and Colorado.|$|E

Bond meets and teams up with Pam Bouvier, an ex-CIA agent and pilot, at a Bimini bar, and journeys {{with her to the}} Republic of Isthmus.

Two Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau officers foil Bond's attempt to assassinate Sanchez and take him to an abandoned warehouse. They are joined by Fallon, an MI6 agent who was sent by M to apprehend Bond. Sanchez's men rescue him and kill the officers, believing them to be the assassins. Later, with the aid of Bouvier, Q, and Sanchez's girlfriend Lupe Lamora, Bond frames Krest by planting the $5 million in the Wavekrest. Sanchez kills Krest via a decompression chamber and admits Bond into his inner circle.|$|E

5|$|From 1964 to 1973, the GDP {{per head}} in US dollars increased. Over the {{eighteen}} years Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half in equivalent US <b>dollars.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{first half of the}} Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5 percent per annum, though this represented slightly less growth than {{in the last years of}} Khrushchev. This can be explained by the reversion of most of Khrushchev's policies when Brezhnev came to power. Over time, however, citizens did find themselves better off than under Khrushchev. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, though three-quarters of this growth happened before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his time in office. Most of the increase in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform, according to an analysis on the performance of the reform carried out by the Moscow State University.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} time-preference {{functions}} (or "discount rates") for R&D should properly {{be considered to}} be functions of <b>the</b> economic environment. <b>In</b> particular, during periods of accelerating growth and general increasing prosperity it is appropriate and rational to prefer a marginal <b>dollar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present to a marginal <b>dollar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. Conversely, during periods of saturating growth and deteriorating prospects, the converse holds: it is rational to prefer a marginal <b>dollar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future to one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present. Periods of increasing general prosperity [...] rising tide [...] are likely {{to be associated with the}} early phases of an industry "life cycle". Periods of declining prosperity, by contrast, may occur towards the end of the life cycle. The implications for R&D policy are derived in terms of a simple model. The results suggest that at the beginning of the life cycle the optimal R&D policy is to invest in short-term, low risk ventures (i. e. product or process improvements). Late <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cycle, however, the optimal policy reverses to long-term high-risk projects. In simple terms: a firm in a declining industry needs to find a new product or business to replace the old one. Unfortunately, the appropriate behavior is discouraged by most existing B/C methodologies...|$|R

By June 1887, the college had raised between $18,000–20,000 and so hired architect William Tubby to design the new hall. Tubby returned to the college with estimates from Poughkeepsie builders ranging in cost from $39,997–50,000, higher than the available budget. The Vassar Board of Trustees formed a subcommittee and attempted to find solutions, including modifying Tubby's designs. The subcommittee received estimates from builders outside of Poughkeepsie (in Kingston, Brooklyn, Troy, and Albany) but the lowest was still above budget at $32,000.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the trading}} of tiger parts in Asia {{has become a}} major black market {{industry}} and governmental and conservation attempts to stop it have been ineffective to date. Almost all black marketers engaged in the trade are based in China and have either been shipped and sold within in their own country or into Taiwan, South Korea or Japan. The Chinese subspecies was almost completely decimated by killing for commerce due to both the parts and skin trades in the 1950s through the 1970s. Contributing to the illegal trade, {{there are a number of}} tiger farms in the country specialising in breeding the cats for profit. It is estimated that between 5,000 and 10,000 captive-bred, semi-tame animals live in these farms today. However, many tigers for traditional medicine black market are wild ones shot or snared by poachers and may be caught anywhere in the tiger's remaining range (from Siberia to India to the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra). In the Asian black market, a tiger penis can be worth the equivalent of around $300 U.S. <b>dollars.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> years of 1990 through 1992, 27 million products with tiger derivatives were found.
