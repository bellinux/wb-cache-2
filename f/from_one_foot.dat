5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic {{rules of the}} modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short run up and then take off <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. The men's high jump {{was included in the}} 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an optimal}} bowling ball {{speed at which}} the player maximizes the chance to knock down all ten bowling pins. Optimal ball speed, which {{is defined as the}} time it takes for the ball to travel <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> past the foul line to the head pin, is 2.3 seconds (this number can shift to 2.2 or 2.4 {{depending}} on the dryness or slickness of the lane). A ball that is rolled too fast will not give the pins enough time to “mix” with other pins, or in other words, to knock each other down in a domino effect motion. Conversely, a ball rolled too slowly will deflect too much and {{will not be able to}} knock down all the pins.|$|E
500|$|Hull was {{promoted}} to flying officer on 16 April 1938. As war loomed, the squadron began to prepare for combat in late 1938, and in December that year was re-equipped with Hawker HurricaneMkIs. Hull reacted to {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in September 1939 with great excitement; according to Hector Bolitho, No. 43 Squadron's intelligence officer, the Rhodesian leapt <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> to the other in the officer's mess, repeating the words [...] "wizard, wizard".|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Soles {{shifted her}} weight <b>from</b> <b>one</b> slippered <b>foot</b> to the other.|$|R
5000|$|A weight {{transfer}} or weight change is dancer's movement {{so that their}} weight is moved <b>from</b> <b>one</b> supporting <b>foot</b> (or supporting limb/body part) to another one fully or partially.|$|R

500|$|The {{transmission}} of the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? on rival channel ITV {{at the same time}} as the final series of One Foot led to the ratings that year being lower than for previous series. The broadcast of [...] "Things Aren't Simple Any More" [...] coincided with the broadcast of the first UK jackpot win on Millionaire. The news of Judith Keppel's win, recorded the preceding Sunday, was leaked to the press; ITV announced Keppel's success at a press conference on the day of broadcast. Renwick was annoyed that this would take [...] "audience interest" [...] away <b>from</b> <b>One</b> <b>Foot.</b> He said that the early announcement of the outcome of Millionaire was [...] "naked opportunism", and it [...] "would have been more honorable to let the show go out in the normal way". He pointed out that they also [...] "killed off any element off tension or surprise in their own programme", but [...] "television is all about ratings". On the night of its broadcast ITV's Who Wants to be a Millionaire? attracted 13.9million viewers (48percent); One Foot, which began transmission fifteen minutes later at 21:15, attracted 10.7million (36percent). The episode peaked at 11.6 million viewers when it ran concurrently with its ITV rival.|$|E
2500|$|The walk is a four-beat gait that averages about [...] When walking, a horse's legs {{follow this}} sequence: left hind leg, left front leg, right hind leg, right front leg, {{in a regular}} 1-2-3-4 beat. At the walk, the horse will always have one foot raised {{and the other three}} feet on the ground, save for a brief moment when weight is being {{transferred}} <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> to another. A horse moves its head and neck in a slight up and down motion that helps maintain balance.|$|E
2500|$|The ISUCF'V'MB {{utilizes}} {{a unique}} and traditional marching style during its pregame presentations. The high-step march (used {{for the majority of}} pregame) incorporates a high leg/knee motion combined with a downward toe point. In addition, a similar half-height, double-time version of the high-step, called 'X'ing, is used to enter the field for pregame performances. The swing cadence the band uses to march into the tunnel is also an ISUCF'V'MB signature; members move in a half-time while jumping <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> to the other to cadence in a motion that is similar to hopping. For halftime performances the band uses [...] "glide step", which allows it to maximize its musical and marching output. This is the step the band uses during parades.|$|E

5000|$|To get the {{ironstone}} {{from the}} new quarries to the station, the Partnership's standard-gauge line was extended down the hillside where it passed under {{the north end of}} the B&CDR's viaduct. A tipping-dock here enabled ore to be tipped into standard-gauge wagons <b>from</b> a <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> eight inch tramway above. The tipping dock was known locally as the [...] "tip-up" [...] or [...] "kick-up".|$|R
50|$|To ceremonially {{shake the}} dust <b>from</b> <b>one's</b> <b>feet</b> as a {{testimony}} against another was {{understood by the}} Jews to symbolize a cessation of fellowship and a renunciation of all responsibility for consequences that might follow. It became an ordinance of accusation and testimony by the Lord's instructions to His apostles as cited in the text the New Testament. In the current dispensation, the Lord has similarly directed His authorized servants to so testify against those who wilfully and maliciously oppose the truth when authoritatively presented (see Doctrine and Covenants 24:15; 60:15; 75:20; 84:92; 99:4). The responsibility of testifying before the Lord by this accusing symbol {{is so great that}} the means may be employed only under unusual and extreme conditions, as the Spirit of the Lord may direct.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout his career, Laudrup was {{acclaimed}} for his technique, balance, elegance, vision, ball control, deep {{passes and}} dribbling ability. In regard to his vision, Jorge Valdano, the Argentinian coach of Laudrup in Real Madrid, said, [...] "e has eyes everywhere." [...] His trademark move– looking {{one way and}} passing the other– fooled countless opponents during his career. The Laudrup dribble, a feint {{also known as the}} croqueta, was perhaps the best-known part of his game, and involved him quickly moving the ball <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> to the other away from the defender. His skills and feints were combined with creativity, which he used to get past defenders in one on one situations. This led to the expression [...] "Made in Laudrup", widely used in Spain about his creative style of play. Numerous teammates of his have said, [...] "Just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "It's All in Your Mind" [...] is {{a single}} by Beck, {{released}} in 1995. Although then a non-album single (being a 7" [...] of outtakes <b>from</b> his album <b>One</b> <b>Foot</b> In The Grave), a later version was recorded and included on his album Sea Change (2002); this recording is more widely known.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{familiar}} example of moulting in reptiles is when snakes [...] "shed their skin". This is usually {{achieved by the}} snake rubbing its head against a hard object, such as a rock (or between two rocks) or piece of wood, causing the already stretched skin to split. At this point, the snake continues to rub its skin on objects, causing the end nearest the head to peel back on itself, until the snake is able to crawl out of its skin, effectively turning the moulted skin inside-out. This is similar to how one might remove a sock <b>from</b> <b>one's</b> <b>foot</b> by grabbing the open end and pulling it over itself. The snake's skin is often left in one piece after the moulting process, including the discarded brille (ocular scale), so that the moult is vital for maintaining the animal's quality of vision. The skins of lizards, in contrast, generally fall off in pieces.|$|R
6000|$|He {{shifted his}} weight <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> to the other. [...] "Well, it's a pretty rough old village, Flo--a pretty rough place for you and mother." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{other men}} shifted <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> {{to another and}} there were {{deep-drawn}} breaths. Jim Cleve alone seemed quiet and cool. But his eyes were ablaze.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Podgers's eyes blinked {{behind his}} gold-rimmed spectacles, {{and he moved}} uneasily <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> to the other, while his fingers played nervously with a flash watch-chain.|$|E
50|$|The height varied, {{generally}} <b>from</b> {{very subtle}} <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> (30 cm) {{to as much}} as two feet (60 cm). The height of these styles was generally about 1 to 1 1/2 times the length of the face, and was styled in what was considered a pyramid shape (it also looks very much like a hot air balloon).|$|R
50|$|The player's {{perspective}} of the pinball table in Pro Pinball: Fantastic Journey is <b>from</b> approximately <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> above the table. The pinball flipper and plunger controls are operated by joystick, gamepad, or keyboard, depending on the operating system. Game options allow the table to play {{as if it were}} in an aged condition and at a slight angle, and players are also given the option to change the number of extra balls they receive, how many times a ball can be saved, as well as adjusting the table slope, plunger power, and general game difficulty.|$|R
5000|$|Alan Jones from Film4's FrightFest concluded: [...] "Some {{may find}} the climax rather disconcerting as Smith pulls the rug <b>from</b> under <b>one’s</b> <b>feet.</b> However, the greater {{percentage}} will thrill {{to the way the}} eerie and puzzling intensity builds up a compelling head of scream as the stark brand of Witchfinder General shock value rears its head in the most startling of codas. This intelligent original represents a commendable break from the genre norm {{and is one of the}} most powerful films made about God, the godless and what the Devil truly represents." ...|$|R
6000|$|McIlheny: [...] "Go ahn, sor; or I'll {{have to do}} the beginnun' meself, pretty soon." [...] He shifts himself <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> {{to another}} with a saltatory briskness.|$|E
60|$|My gudesire saw {{everything}} look so muckle against him, that he grew nearly desperate--however, {{he shifted}} <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> to another, looked to {{every corner of}} the room, and made no answer.|$|E
60|$|Old Miguel stood silent, {{shifting}} <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> to another, {{his eyes}} cast down, his slender brown fingers spasmodically pressing {{the rim of}} his sombrero. But when he spoke {{it was in his}} former quiet manner.|$|E
5000|$|Nietzsche {{recognizes the}} crisis that the death of God {{represents}} for existing moral assumptions: [...] "When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out <b>from</b> under <b>one's</b> <b>feet.</b> This morality {{is by no means}} self-evident... By breaking one main concept out of Christianity, the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one's hands." [...] This is why in [...] "The Madman", a passage which primarily addresses nontheists (especially atheists), the problem is to retain any system of values {{in the absence of a}} divine order.|$|R
5000|$|These bonus {{tracks are}} outtakes <b>from</b> the <b>One</b> <b>Foot</b> in the Grave {{sessions}} and were issued on the [...] "It's All In Your Mind" [...] 7" [...] single in 1995. Both [...] "Feather in Your Cap" [...] and [...] "It's All in Your Mind" [...] were later re-recorded as full studio productions {{with a full}} band. The former was recorded in 1994 and issued as a B-side of the [...] "Sissyneck" [...] and [...] "Jack-Ass" [...] singles in 1997 while the latter appeared in a re-recorded version on the 2002 album Sea Change.|$|R

6000|$|Captain Lige listened, and {{he shifted}} <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> to the other, {{and rubbed his}} hands, which were red. Some odd trick of the mind had put into his head two people--Eliphalet Hopper and Jacob Cluyme. Was he like them? ...|$|E
50|$|The skill {{displayed}} by the Spanish desperado in handling his knife is wonderful. This weapon, {{to which all}} are so partial, is a wicked-looking affair, <b>from</b> <b>one</b> to two <b>feet</b> long, and called a navaja from its resemblance to a razor. The blade is of the finest Toledo steel...|$|R
50|$|Kol is a genus of alvarezsaurid {{theropod}} dinosaur {{from the}} Late Cretaceous of Mongolia. The type specimen was excavated from the Ukhaa Tolgod locality of the Djadochta Formation, dating to about 75 million years ago. It {{is believed to}} have been about twice the size of the contemporary Shuvuuia. However, unlike Shuvuuia, which is known from many well preserved specimens, and although Ukhaa Tolgod has been thoroughly explored, Kol is known only <b>from</b> <b>one</b> complete <b>foot,</b> suggesting that it must have been relatively rare in that ecosystem.|$|R
5000|$|The knee raise {{exercise}} {{will work}} the lower abdominals, {{and can also}} work the obliques (see abdominal external oblique muscle and abdominal internal oblique muscle) if one twists the torso during the exercise. This version of the knee raise has been praised by fitness communities for its effectiveness as working the abdominal muscles. Previous {{research has shown that}} a captain's chair knee raise will elicit a greater electromyography (EMG) response than the standard crunch. This means that the knee raise in the captain's chair will have more activation in the muscle than the standard crunch. However, 2013 research has shown that it has the same EMG activity as the standard crunch. This newer research is yet to be published. One aspect that both research agree on {{is that there is no}} difference in activation of upper rectus abdominis and lower rectus abdominis as it is speculated that the muscle acts as one and cannot be differentiated. [...] Advanced users may increase resistance by wearing a weighted vest or ankle weights, holding a dumbbell between the feet, kettlebells on the toes, a resistance band tied <b>from</b> <b>one's</b> <b>feet</b> to the bottom of the tower, or other heavy weights.|$|R
