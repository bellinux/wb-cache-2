And you go and talk about me to a perfect stranger as if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>baby.</b> And now he'll go and laugh at you with the Burtons, and they'll say it's just like you to say everything that comes into your head, that way, and think everybody's as nice as they seem.

If you Google Wikipedia for {{community}} learning and development or community education, only two examples are referenced: Scotland and the State of Wisconsin in the USA. Apparently neither terms are used {{these days in}} the policies and practice of countries worldwide. This is surprising- {{not only because it}} is wrong but also because in fact community learning and development <b>is</b> <b>a</b> worldwide phenomenon. The term may not be being used in other countries, but this work has <b>been</b> part of <b>an</b> incredible educational revolution that has been taking place certainly since the later 1960 s. <b>A</b> revolution that <b>is</b> called people power. I have recently retired after nearly 40 years in community learning and development.
