5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output per head. This can be <b>done</b> <b>if</b> the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E

25|$|During {{the ritual}} salat prayer, {{if a person}} forgets to do one {{of the actions of}} prayer he can make up for certain actions by {{performing}} two sujud {{at the end of the}} prayer.

50|$|This basic {{definition}} does not specify what to <b>do</b> <b>if</b> {{none of the}} proposed results are correct, though reciprocal rank 0 {{could be used in}} this situation. It also does not specify what to <b>do</b> <b>if</b> there are multiple correct answers in the list. In this case, mean average precision is a potential alternative metric.|$|R
25|$|The cricket season started early, on 8 April, with MCC {{playing the}} Champion County, {{or at least}} it would have <b>done</b> <b>if</b> the rain had not delayed the start till the next day. The other games played were all between the {{first-class}} counties and university sides. The first matches showed a bumper crop of centuries, with little joy for bowlers, but there were no surprises. The MCC ended up beating Warwickshire.|$|E
25|$|The diver {{must carry}} {{sufficient}} weight to remain neutral at the shallowest decompression stop {{after all the}} gas has been used. This {{will result in the}} diver being somewhat negative {{at the start of the}} dive, and the buoyancy compensator must have sufficient volume to neutralise this excess. Calculation of the required weight and buoyancy volume can be <b>done</b> <b>if</b> the mass of the stored gas is known.|$|E
25|$|Because {{double and}} single track may use {{different}} signalling systems, {{it may be}} awkward and confusing to mix double and single track too often. For example, intermediate mechanical signal boxes on a double-track line can be closed during periods of light traffic, but this cannot be <b>done</b> <b>if</b> there is a single-line section in between. This problem is less serious with electrical signalling such as Centralized traffic control.|$|E

25|$|In typical {{people who}} are not known to be at high risk of PE, imaging is helpful to confirm or exclude a {{diagnosis}} of PE after simpler first-line tests are used. Medical societies recommend tests such as the D-dimer to first provide supporting evidence for the need for imaging, and imaging would be <b>done</b> <b>if</b> other tests confirmed a moderate or high probability of finding evidence to support a diagnosis of PE.|$|E
25|$|The Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) was {{established}} in 1989 and gained affiliate membership of the ICC the same year. They were quickly promoted to associate member status the following year. Also in 1990 the national side returned to action, twice losing heavily to the Netherlands. These heavy defeats showed that much work needed to be <b>done</b> <b>if</b> the UAE were {{to be successful in}} the 1994 ICC Trophy and the ECB adopted a controversial policy.|$|E
25|$|Hillary Clinton {{followed}} {{the advice of}} Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on raising children in the White House, and asked the press to limit coverage of Chelsea to her participation in public events such as state visits. Margaret Truman, daughter of former president Harry S. Truman, supported the Clintons, and in March 1993 {{wrote a letter to}} the editor of The New York Times about the damage that could be <b>done</b> <b>if</b> the press made Chelsea a subject of intense coverage.|$|E

25|$|Laser {{therapy is}} the use of high-intensity light to destroy tumor cells while {{affecting}} only the treated area. This is typically <b>done</b> <b>if</b> the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. The relief of a blockage can help with pain and difficulty swallowing. Photodynamic therapy, a type of laser therapy, involves the use of drugs that are absorbed by cancer cells; when exposed to a special light, the drugs become active and destroy the cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|According to the workers, TEPCO {{did little}} to inform them about the hazards of the intake of {{radioactive}} iodine. All workers with an estimated dose of 100 millisieverts were offered an annual ultrasound thyroid test during their lifetime for free. But TEPCO {{did not know how}} many of these people had received a medical screening already. A schedule for the thyroid gland test was not announced. TEPCO did not indicate what would be <b>done</b> <b>if</b> abnormalities were spotted during the tests.|$|E
25|$|A {{useful and}} {{straightforward}} calculation can be <b>done</b> <b>if</b> {{we assume that}} interest, after expenses, taxes, and inflation is zero. Assume that in real (after-inflation) terms, your salary never changes during your w years of working life. During your p years of pension, you have a living standard that costs a replacement ratio R {{times as much as}} your living standard in your working life. Your working life living standard is your salary less the proportion of salary Z that you need to save. Calculations are per unit salary (e.g., assume salary = 1).|$|E

25|$|To {{interrupt}} a read burst by a {{write command}} is possible, but more difficult. It can be <b>done,</b> <b>if</b> the DQM signal {{is used to}} suppress output from the SDRAM so that the memory controller may drive data over the DQ lines to the SDRAM {{in time for the}} write operation. Because the effects of DQM on read data are delayed by 2 cycles, but the effects of DQM on write data are immediate, DQM must be raised (to mask the read data) beginning at least two cycles before write command, but must be lowered for the cycle of the write command (assuming the write command is intended to have an effect).|$|E
25|$|The Finnish National Archives website {{lists the}} names of the 95,000 Finnish war dead. The war dead {{database}} 1939-1945 includes all servicemen and women who died during being listed in the Finnish army, navy or the air force. It also includes foreign volunteers who died during their service in Finland and Finnish SS-men who died while serving in the German army.The database contains civilians in case they have been buried at a military cemetery. That was sometimes <b>done</b> <b>if</b> the deceased was, for example, an ammunition worker, air raid victim or a civilian worker who for some other reason died because of the war. Some parishes continued burying in second world war military cemeteries up to the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Most times {{a foreign}} {{language}} is spoken in film, subtitles are used to translate the dialogue for the viewer. However, there are occasions when foreign dialogue is left unsubtitled (and thus incomprehensible {{to most of the}} target audience). This is often <b>done</b> <b>if</b> the movie is seen predominantly from the viewpoint of a particular character who does not speak the language. Such absence of subtitles allows the audience to feel a similar sense of incomprehension and alienation that the character feels. An example of this is seen in Not Without My Daughter. The Persian language dialogue spoken by the Iranian characters is not subtitled because the main character Betty Mahmoody does not speak Persian and the audience is seeing the film from her viewpoint.|$|E
