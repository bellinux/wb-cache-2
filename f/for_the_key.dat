5|$|The overall {{number of}} viewers rose {{slightly}} for the thirteenth episode, {{the first of}} a two-parter, when it was watched by 157,000 people, but the viewing figures <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> 18–34 demographics was at a low of 81,000. The following week, the episode that concluded the two-parter picked up viewers, reaching an estimated total of 206,000. Brioux commented again about Degrassi: The Next Generation still being on the schedules, wondering when CTV was going to announce its cancellation and noting that The Amazing Race, which follows it in the scheduling, was watched by ten times the number of Degrassis viewers. That pattern was repeated the following week, when Degrassi: The Next Generation was watched by 222,000 viewers, compared to 1,834,000 viewers for The Amazing Race, 1,579,000 viewers for Desperate Housewives and 1,106,000 viewers for The Mentalist, which were broadcast by CTV later in the evening.|$|E

25|$|Many stream ciphers {{are based}} on linear-feedback shift {{registers}} (LFSRs), which, while efficient in hardware, are less so in software. The design of RC4 avoids the use of LFSRs and is ideal for software implementation, as it requires only byte manipulations. It uses 256 bytes of memory for the state array, S through S, k bytes of memory <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>key,</b> key through key, and integer variables, i, j, and K. Performing a modular reduction of some value modulo 256 {{can be done with}} a bitwise AND with 255 (which is equivalent to taking the low-order byte of the value in question).|$|E

The Central Asian sections of the Silk Road routes were expanded around 114 BC largely through the missions and explorations of Zhang Qian.

25|$|The Dodgers next {{started a}} key {{series against the}} San Francisco Giants at AT Park, hoping to make up ground in the standings. However, they dropped the opener of the series 5–2.

However, the team fell 5 games behind the Giants when Barry Zito shut them out the next day, 4–0. On September 11, Kershaw only allowed three hits and one unearned run against the Arizona Diamondbacks but it was too much as Ian Kennedy blanked the Dodgers 1–0.

25|$|In his Cabinet appointments, Pierce {{sought to}} unite {{a party that}} was squabbling over the fruits of victory. Pierce sought to unite the party by {{appointing}} Democrats from all factions, including those that had not supported the Compromise of 1850. He anchored his cabinet around Attorney General Caleb Cushing, a pro-compromise northerner, and Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, who had led Southern resistance to the compromise in the Senate. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> position of Secretary of State, Pierce chose William L. Marcy, who had served as Secretary of War under President Polk. To appease the Cass and Buchanan wings of the party, Pierce appointed Secretary of the Interior Robert McClelland of Michigan and Postmaster General James Campbell of Pennsylvania, respectively. Pierce rounded out his geographically-balanced cabinet with Secretary of the Navy James C. Dobbin of North Carolina and Secretary of the Treasury James Guthrie. All initial cabinet appointees would remain in place throughout Pierce's presidency.|$|E

25|$|The {{second trial}} began January 11, 1922, {{with a new}} jury, but with the same legal defense and {{prosecution}} {{as well as the}} same presiding judge. The same evidence was presented, but this time one of the witnesses, Zey Prevon, testified that Brady had forced her to lie. Another witness who testified during the first trial, a former security guard named Jesse Norgard, who worked at Culver Studios where Arbuckle worked, testified that Arbuckle had once shown up at the studio and offered him a cash bribe in exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to Rappe's dressing room. The comedian supposedly said he wanted it to play a joke on the actress. Norgard said he refused to give him the key. During cross-examination, Norgard's testimony was called into question when he was revealed to be an ex-convict who was currently charged with sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, and who was also looking for a sentence reduction from Brady in exchange for his testimony. Further, in contrast to the first trial, Rappe's history of promiscuity and heavy drinking was detailed. The second trial also discredited some major evidence such as the identification of Arbuckle's fingerprints on the hotel bedroom door: Heinrich took back his earlier testimony from the first trial and testified that the fingerprint evidence was likely faked. The defense was so convinced of an acquittal that Arbuckle was not called to testify. Arbuckle's lawyer, McNab, made no closing argument to the jury. However, some jurors interpreted the refusal to let Arbuckle testify as a sign of guilt. After over 40 hours of deliberation, the jury returned February 3, deadlocked with a 10–2 not guilty verdict, resulting in another mistrial.|$|E

Shirotsuki, whom Hibiki refers to as [...] "Master", is searching <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to immortality. He is a renowned expert at the craft known as Magic Circles, which draws its power from the art of elaborate circles that enact various enchantments. Even though Shirotsuki invites Hibiki to learn what he knows, she is unskilled in magic and rarely succeeds in anything she does. In spite of repeatedly failing, she keeps trying with her teacher's encouragement.|$|E

40|$|Shabal {{is based}} on a new provably secure mode of operation. Some related-key distinguishers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{underlying}} <b>keyed</b> permutation have been exhibited recently by Aumasson et al. and Knudsen et al., but with no visible impact on the security of Shabal. This paper then aims at extensively studying such distinguishers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>keyed</b> permutation used in Shabal, and at clarifying the impact that they exert on the security of the full hash function. Most interestingly, a new security proof for Shabal’s mode of operation is provided where <b>the</b> <b>keyed</b> permutation is not assumed to be an ideal cipher anymore, but observes a distinguishing property i. e., an explicit relation verified by all its inputs and outputs. As a consequence of this extended proof, all known distinguishers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>keyed</b> permutation are proven not to weaken the security of Shabal. In our study, we provide the foundation of a generalization of the indifferentiability framework to biased random primitives, this part being of independent interest. ...|$|R

500|$|In 1863, Evans {{employed}} Walter Crane {{to illustrate}} covers for inexpensive novels sold in railroad stations called [...] "yellow backs"—after their yellow covers. In 1865, {{they began to}} collaborate on toy books of nursery rhymes and fairy tales. Between 1865 and 1876, Crane and Evans produced two or three toybooks a year. The earliest of the series (which grew in popularity) showed only two colours—red and blue—with black or blue used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> block. Crane illustrated the early books, printed by Evans, This Is the House That Jack Built and Sing a Song of Sixpence, in which the simple designs are presented without background ornamentation and printed only in red, blue and black. Between 1865 and 1886, Crane illustrated 50 toybooks, {{all of which were}} engraved and printed by Evans. These commercially successful books established Crane {{as one of the most}} popular illustrators of children's books in England.|$|E
500|$|According to musicologist Arthur Jacobs, Gilbert's plot [...] "admirably sparked off Sullivan's genius". Sullivan {{embraces the}} {{nautical}} setting; in [...] "We Sail the Ocean Blue", for example, he [...] "presents his twist on a traditional sea shanty". In the Captain's opening song, [...] "I am the Captain of the Pinafore", {{he admits that}} his gentlemanliness [...] "never... well, hardly ever" [...] gives way to swearing at his men, and although he has experience at sea, he [...] "hardly ever" [...] suffers from seasickness. Sullivan [...] "unerringly found the right musical setting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> phrase 'What never?'... cunningly sharpened... through the chromatic touch on the bassoon." [...] Audrey Williamson argued that the music of Pinafore is quintessentially English and free of European influences {{throughout most of the}} score, from the [...] "glee" [...] for Ralph, the Boatswain and the Carpenter, to [...] "For He Is an Englishman".|$|E

Soon after Hata was tasked with coordinating another collaborative research project, this one for the Finance Ministry, {{on the subject of the}} occupation of Japan by the United States after World WarII. JohnW.
