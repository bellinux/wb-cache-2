5|$|Botanist Robert Brown was {{the first}} to write a {{detailed}} scientific description of the koala in 1814, based on a female specimen captured near what is now Mount Kembla in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Austrian botanical illustrator Ferdinand Bauer drew the animal's skull, throat, feet, and paws. Brown's work remained unpublished and largely unnoticed, however, as his field books and notes remained in his possession until his death, when they were bequeathed to the British Museum (Natural History) in London. They were not identified until 1994, while Bauer's koala watercolours were not published until 1989. British surgeon Everard Home included details of the koala based on eyewitness accounts of William Paterson, who had befriended Brown and Bauer during their stay in New South Wales. <b>Home,</b> <b>who</b> in 1808 published his report in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, gave the animal the scientific name Didelphis coola.|$|E

5|$|Under Mohammad Daoud Khan's prime ministership, {{suppression}} of radicals was common. However, {{because of his}} language skills, Taraki {{was sent to the}} Afghan Embassy in the United States in 1952. Within several months Taraki began denouncing the Afghan government under King Zahir Shah and accused it of being autocratic and dictatorial. His denunciation of the Afghan government earned him much publicity in the United States. It also attracted unfavorable attention from authorities back <b>home,</b> <b>who</b> relieved him of his post and ordered him repatriated but stopped short of placing him under arrest. After a short period of unemployment Taraki started working for the United States Overseas Mission in Kabul as an interpreter. He quit that job in 1958 and established his own translation company, the Noor Translation Bureau. Four years later, he started working for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, but quit in 1963 to focus on the establishment of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), a communist political party.|$|E

5|$|When Randall {{returned}} to Washington in 1881 {{to begin his}} term in the 47th Congress, the legislature was controlled by Republicans. After Garfield's assassination later that year, Vice President Chester A. Arthur assumed the presidency. Arthur, like most Republicans, favored high tariffs, but he sought to simplify the tariff structure and to reduce excise taxes. Randall, who had {{returned to}} his seat on the Appropriations Committee, favored the president's plan, and was among the few Democrats in the House to support the it. The bill {{that emerged from the}} Ways and Means Committee, dominated by protectionists, provided for only a 10 percent reduction. After conference with the Senate, the resulting bill had an even smaller effect, reducing tariffs by an average of 1.47 percent. It passed both houses narrowly on March3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law. Toward the end, Randall took less part in the debate, feeling the tension between his supporters in the House, who wanted more reductions, and his constituents at <b>home,</b> <b>who</b> wanted less.|$|E
