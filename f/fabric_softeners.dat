50|$|Electrically {{conductive}} {{fabric softener}} chemicals may also prevent static charge buildup in clothes dryers. Other functions manufacturers claim include less friction during ironing, increased stain resistance, reduced wrinkling and pilling, and lower drying time. Most contain fragrances. Cationic <b>fabric</b> <b>softeners</b> are added during the rinse cycle {{rather than the}} wash cycle because they can interfere with detergent cleaning action. In addition to fabric softening chemicals, <b>fabric</b> <b>softeners</b> may include acids or bases to maintain optimal pH for absorption, silicone-based anti-foaming agents, emulsion stabilizers, fragrances, and colors.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{ingredients}} affect aesthetic {{properties of the}} item to be cleaned or the detergent itself before or during use. These agents include optical brighteners, <b>fabric</b> <b>softeners,</b> and colourants. A variety of perfumes are also components of modern detergents, provided that they are compatible with the other components and do not affect the colour of the cleaned item. The perfumes are typically a mixture of many compounds, a popular component being cyclohexyl salicylate, which is related to oil of wintergreen.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, {{manufactures}} introduced distearyldimethylammonium chloride (DHTDMAC) as {{a fabric}} softener, initially {{to counteract the}} harsh feel that the machine washing imparted to nappies (cloth diapers). They had to discontinue using this compound because the cation biodegrades very slowly. Contemporary <b>fabric</b> <b>softeners</b> are most often based on salts of quaternary ammonium cations. Characteristically, the cations contain one or two long alkyl chains derived from fatty acids. Other cationic compounds {{can be derived from}} imidazolium, substituted amine salts, or quaternary alkoxy ammonium salts.|$|E
50|$|In the 2000´s, <b>fabric</b> <b>softeners</b> were {{launched}} {{to provide more}} resistant to external stress and wrinkle recovery, which can be improved by spraying fabrics with aqueous emulsions (made with vegetable oils). The sprays allow the fibers to slide closer to each other, helping them hold their shapes. More over, this process is cheaper, simpler, and minimizes chemical waste, and water/energy consumption. The anti-wrinkle sprays with higher concentration of the vegetable oil, which active agents are low in unsaturated fatty acids, are more effective.|$|E
50|$|In chemistry, a {{fatty amine}} is any amine {{attached}} to a hydrocarbon chain of eight or more carbon atoms in length. These compounds are classified as oleochemicals. More commonly fatty amines are derived from C12-C18 hydrocarbons, which in turn are derived from the more abundant fatty acids. They are often mixtures. Commercially important members include coco amine, oleylamine, tallow amine, and soya amine. Some applications of these compounds are in <b>fabric</b> <b>softeners,</b> froth flotation agents (purification of ores), and corrosion inhibitors. They are {{the basis for a}} variety of cosmetic formulations.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, distearyldimethylammonium {{chloride}} (DHTDMAC), {{was introduced}} as a fabric softener. This compound was discontinued because the cation biodegrades too slowly. Contemporary <b>fabric</b> <b>softeners</b> {{are based on}} salts of quaternary ammonium cations where the fatty acid {{is linked to the}} quaternary center via ester linkages; these are commonly referred to as betaine-esters or ester-quats and are susceptible to degradation, e.g., by hydrolysis. Characteristically, the cations contain one or two long alkyl chains derived from fatty acids linked to an ethoxylated ammonium salt. Other cationic compounds can be derived from imidazolium, guanidinium, substituted amine salts, or quaternary alkoxy ammonium salts.|$|E
50|$|Cationic head {{groups have}} a {{positive}} charge and cationic surfactants are used in several different applications. One common use for cationic surfactants is in <b>fabric</b> <b>softeners.</b> Cationic head groups are also added to laundry detergent in conjunction with anionic surfactants because they help to improve the dirt removal properties of the anionic surfactants. Cationic head groups also increase the disinfecting properties of household cleaners. Some common cationic surfactants head groups include amines and quaternary ammonium ions. Among the many types of surfactants, cationic surfactants are very useful corrosion inhibitors due of their protective effectiveness in neutral and acidic media.|$|E
50|$|Many modern washing {{machines}} have a dispenser that adds liquid fabric softener automatically {{on the final}} rinse. Users of launderette machines may need to add it manually. Some washing powder brands have fabric conditioning mixed in, which manufacturers claim saves money compared to buying separate washing powder and fabric softener. Some manufacturers claim their products make ironing easier or make clothes dry faster. All liquid <b>fabric</b> <b>softeners</b> are added to water—either by adding the product directly to the final rinse water or by 2:1 (water:softener) dilution in an automatic dispenser. Even diluted fabric softener can cause spotting when poured directly onto clothes, and can ruin them.|$|E
50|$|Multibranding {{strategy}} {{is when a}} company gives each product a distinct name. Multibranding is best used as an approach when each brand in intended for a different market segment. Multibranding is used in an assortment of ways with selected companies grouping their brands based on price-quality segments. Procter & Gamble (P&G), a multinational consumer goods company that offers over 100 brands, each suited for different consumer needs. For instance, Head & Shoulders that helps consumers relieve dandruff {{in the form of}} a shampoo, Oral-B which offers inter-dental products, Vicks which offers cough and cold products, and Downy which offers dryer sheets and <b>fabric</b> <b>softeners.</b> Other examples include Coca-Cola, Nestlé, Kellogg's, and Mars.|$|E
5000|$|By contrast, {{commercial}} washers {{for internal}} business operations (still {{often referred to}} as [...] "washer/extractor" [...] machines) may include features absent from domestic machines. Many commercial washers offer an option for automatic injection of five or more different chemical types, so that the operator does not have to deal with constantly measuring out soap products and <b>fabric</b> <b>softeners</b> for each load by hand. Instead, a precise metering system draws the detergents and wash additives directly from large liquid-chemical storage barrels and injects them as needed into the various wash and rinse cycles. Some computer-controlled commercial washers offer the operator control over the various wash and rinse cycles, allowing the operator to program custom washing cycles.|$|E
50|$|Fragrance {{chemicals}} {{are found in}} most cleaning products, perfumes, and personal care products. More than 3000 {{chemicals are}} used in these fragrance mixtures. The synthetic musks used in detergents accumulate in the environment and are harmful to aquatic organisms. Certain musks are possible endocrine disruptors that interfere with hormone functioning. Phthalates are a common ingredient in these fragrance mixtures found in laundry detergents and <b>fabric</b> <b>softeners.</b> These phthalates are suspected endocrine disrupters that affect reproduction rates including reduced sperm count in males. Certain glass cleaners and floor polishes contain dibutyl phthalate (DBP). The European Union classifies DBP as very toxic to aquatic organisms, posing a huge danger as these cleaners, especially the floor polishes are often rinsed down the drain and into aquatic environments.|$|E
5000|$|Dimethyldioctadecylammonium {{chloride}} also commonly distearyl dimethyl {{ammonium chloride}} is an organic compound classified as quaternary ammonium salt.
