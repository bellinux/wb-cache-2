Nests typically have <b>external</b> <b>dimensions</b> of 20 × 30cm (8 × 12in), but their size varies greatly. The building of the nest is initiated by the unmated male while displaying to females. The female assists in building, but is less active than the male. Some nest building occurs throughout the year, especially after moult in autumn. In colder areas house sparrows build specially created roost nests, or roost in street lights, to avoid losing heat during the winter. House sparrows do not hold territories, but they defend their nests aggressively against intruders of the same sex.|$|E

40|$|This project {{examines}} why the EU {{is developing}} an <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of their asylum policy and which humanitarian consequenses this cause. The project is build on a {{hypothesis that the}} <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of the asylum policy is a breach of the etablished rules. This breach can {{be a result of}} a securization of asylum seeker’s and refugee’s. To investigate whether the development of the externel dimension of EU’s asylum policy is an expression of a securization, the discource and legislation is analysed. The analysis conclude the conflicting result that the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> is breaking the rules of the refugee convention, but that asylum seeker’s and refugee’s haven’t been represented as a threat. In spite of this the context that asylum seeker’s and refugee’s are situated in can constitute a discource whereby the object is securized anyway. In addition to that the lacking media coverage of EU politician’s can imply that they can lead a policy that is different to the one that was represented. The ekstraterritorialization lead to a number of consequenses, partly because the right to seek asylum is restricted and partly because the quality of protection that is provided towards refugee’s is reduced...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how the European Commission incorporated and implemented migration policy {{as part of}} the European Union’s external relations, also known as the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of migration. The focus of the thesis is on the period between the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty in 1999, when migration largely came to fall under the Commission’s remit, and the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. The study compares how the Commission’s Directorates-General (DGs) involved in the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of migration during this period—Justice, Liberty and Security, External Relations and Development—made sense of the changes introduced to their responsibilities. The thesis proposes that the concept of organisational culture, drawn from organisational sociology, can explain how actors interact with and collectively make sense of their organisational environment. The main argument of the thesis is that each of the DGs possesses an organisational culture based on its members’ shared readings of priorities and the function of their unit. The thesis examines these divergent organisational cultures to gauge how policies are internalised and translated into output. The analysis contributes to the external governance literature, which has theorised the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of migration as a continuation of European integration processes without accounting for internal organisational dynamics. It also leads to reflections on organisational sociology theorising, and the implications of the findings on studies of organisational change and implementation. This thesis is divided into five chapters. The first provides a background for how the Commission came to be involved in migration policy. The second provides a theoretical framework for the study, building on organisational sociology. The remaining chapters empirically analyse the three elements of organisational culture: DG members’ sources of organisational identity, their perceptions and prioritisations of the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of migration, and their reading of the Commission’s implementation practices, focusing on relations with Morocco as a tool for illustrating the latter...|$|R

Now work is being made of the implementation and the financial implications of this new policy area. However, {{this seems to be}} quite problematic.

Regional Protection Programmes, which seek to enhance protection capacity in third countries, as well as the efforts to establish a voluntary Joint European Resettlement Programme in solidarity towards third states, are analysed.

From the rear of the two lifter galleries oil is then supplied up to the two rocker arm shafts which serve as galleries to lubricate the valve train. The fore and aft direction changes are designed to eliminate stale oil areas which tend to form sludge deposits. Juxtaposed with the Rambler V8, the Chevrolet small-block engine feeds both lifter galleries and the central cam and crankshaft galleries simultaneously through a three way split from the rear, having oil proceed to the front of the engine, the lifter galleries feeding oil to the valve train through hollow pushrods.|$|E

The next year, the 326 would become a true 326 with a new bore size of 3.72. The Tempest's popularity helped move Pontiac into third place among American car brands in 1962, a position Pontiac would hold through 1970.

The swept volume of the Diesel engine was reduced by 23.4% as the cylinders had a bore of 140mm (5.51in), compared with the A.12's 160mm (6.30in). Two camshafts were fitted to operate the four valves per cylinder, though they were driven via the same tall vertical rod used for the single camshaft of the A.12, at its top, and the water pump of both models at its bottom.|$|E
