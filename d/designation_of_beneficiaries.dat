For each of these areas of concern, the TPSC further identified specific policy objectives to be pursued with the relevant governments, with the general aim of soliciting assurances that these concerns would be addressed. For those countries for which concerns and objectives had been identified, U.S. Embassy officials in the Caribbean Basin region and other U.S. government officials conducted intensive advocacy with local government officials.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{inspired}} by a new form for registering corporate shares that is now available to certain stockholders of Southwestern Bell Corporation (SBC). Designed to replace stock registrations that make two or more persons appear to be co-owners, the new form, referred to herein as a transfer-on-death (TOD) registration, enables a sole owner to register a <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> a death <b>beneficiary</b> in whose favor a transfer on death of the registered shares may occur outside the probate process. The new registration form extends a key provision of the Uniform Probate Code (U. P. C.) {{that was designed to}} encourage development of non-probate methods other than co-ownership for arranging for asset transfers on death. Part I of the article examines the legal and practical considerations regarding joint ownership of investment securities that may have led SBC to develop curative measures. Part II analyzes statutory and decisional law questions bearing on the validity of TOD registration plans. Part III describes the major features of SBC 2 ̆ 7 s new, optional stock registration mode and explores and rejects joing registrations with a provision for control by either owner, the 2 ̆ 2 A or B 2 ̆ 2 form, as an apparently simpler solution to many co-ownership problems. Part IV explores the prospects for a new uniform law project aimed at simplifying TOD registrations and protecting intermediaries who might use the new title form...|$|R

40|$|Lack of {{appropriate}} level <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement during the project lifecycle {{may lead to}} mismatch between the project output and needs <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> Therefore, involving beneficiaries in the project helps {{to assure that the}} Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) provide the right solution to needs <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> as well as sustaining project results. Although beneficiary involvement is useful, the challenge is to determine how and when to involve beneficiaries in the project.    The {{purpose of this study is}} to improve the process <b>of</b> managing <b>beneficiary</b> involvement in NGOs. To achieve this, a review of the existing literature was done to have an initial understanding <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement. During our literature review, we identified six progressive levels of involvement which include: information sharing, listening and learning, joint assessment, shared decision-making, collaboration and empowerment.  Based on this literature review, we suggested a framework for managing beneficiary involvement.   In addition, we conducted a multiple case study and collected data from five different cases through interviews. Our respondents were professionals with several years of experience in developing and implementing development projects which are aimed at improving the livelihood of vulnerable communities. Through the analysis of the empirical findings, we got new insights on how the process <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement is managed. We identified four additional levels <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement within the project cycle. These include incentive system, peer facilitators, group forming, and cost sharing. The study also reveals the factors that affect beneficiary involvement, such as cultural context and, donors’ influence and requirements. We also highlighted that the appropriate level <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement should be chosen depending on the project context. Regardless of these factors, the research findings show that beneficiary involvement creates a sense of ownership, enhances project outcome and is useful in sustaining a project’s results in the long term. Therefore, NGOs should endeavour to involve beneficiaries as much as possible to ensure that the projects being implemented are addressing community needs...|$|R
