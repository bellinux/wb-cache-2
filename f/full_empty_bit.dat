Conversely any law that fails for some concrete Boolean algebra must have failed at a particular bit position, in which case that position by itself furnishes a one-bit counterexample to that law. Nondegeneracy ensures the existence {{of at least one}} bit position because there is only one <b>empty</b> <b>bit</b> vector.|$|R

30|$|Images with “burned in” annotations/markers {{should also}} {{retrieve}} exceptional handling.

As discussed with possibly <b>empty</b> <b>bit</b> layers and the absence of high frequencies above, we need to reduce the ratios for the irreversible encoding to avoid putting too much compression on the images, losing their diagnostic applicability.|$|R

30|$|The {{observation}} instrument {{measures the}} direction of particle arrival and propagation of electromagnetic waves synchronously with the satellite spin. Therefore, the spin index pulse (pulses notifying the timing when the sun sensor has detected the sun in each spin) should be distributed to each instrument. The MDP receives the spin index pulse from the bus part as a pulse by an RS 422 signal, a dedicated line. After the receipt, the MDP delivers the spin index pulses to each instrument using the TimeCode function with an error of 30  μs or less. The TimeCode used for the above synchronization of the time slot is distinguished by changing the identifier flag that is the <b>empty</b> <b>bit</b> of the time code in the RMAP regulation.|$|R

40|$|The Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 (CZTS) {{semiconductor}} is {{a potential}} photovoltaic material due to its optoelectronic properties. These optoelectronic properties can be potentially improved by the insertion of intermediate states into the energy bandgap. We explore this possibility using Cr as an impurity. We carried out first-principles calculations within the density functional theory analyzing three substitutions: Cu, Sn, or Zn by Cr. In all cases, the Cr introduces a deeper band into the host energy bandgap. Depending on the substitution, this band is <b>full,</b> <b>empty,</b> or partially <b>full.</b> The absorption coefficients in the independent-particle approximation have also been obtained. Comparison between the pure and doped host's absorption coefficients shows that this deeper band opens more photon absorption channels and could therefo:e increase the solar-light absorption {{with respect to the}} host...|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} flower motifs called orchids and tulips, {{but these are}} not botanical names. They are {{actually}} the names given to fantastical flowers, as neither of these flowers was commonly found in Ukraine until modern times. The names reflected the exoticism of the designs.Non-specific flowers are much more common, and consist of the ruzha and others. The ruzha (or rozha) is named after the mallow flower, although it does not resemble one, and is another name given to the eight-pointed star motif. A ruzha can be <b>full,</b> <b>empty,</b> compound, divided or even crooked. It is a sun sign. Other non-specific types often have hyphenated names: potato-flower, strawberry-flower, etc. They are usually simple arrangements of petals, six or more, and bear little resemblance to the plant they are named for.|$|R
