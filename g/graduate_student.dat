5|$|Although he {{had never}} {{finished}} high school, {{with the help of}} the GI Bill, Rothenberg completed a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois in 1954. He attended graduate school at the University of Chicago, where he was recognized as an argumentative, sometimes abrasive, <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> with a keen mind. As a <b>graduate</b> <b>student,</b> Rothenberg reviewed W.E.D. Allens Caucasian Battlefields: A History of the Wars on the Turco-Caucasian Border, 1828–1921 (Cambridge University Press, 1953) for Journal of Modern History, He wrote his 1956 masters' thesis entitled General Crook and the Apaches, 1871–1874: the campaign in the Tonto Basin. Rothenberg received his doctorate from the University of Illinois: his 1959 dissertation, Antemurales Christianitatis: then military border in Croatia, 1522–1749, was published in 1960 by the University of Chicago Press, as The Military Border in Croatia, 1522–1749; he followed this with a second study, The Military Border in Croatia, 1750–1888: a study of an imperial institution in 1966, also published by University of Chicago Press.

30|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} whether <b>graduate</b> <b>students</b> are an {{important}} factor in their supervisors’ research productivity, with the assumption that managing more <b>graduate</b> <b>students</b> would allow more research to be conducted. Specifically, Korean academics in regional universities (i.e. universities far from the capital) sometimes report having trouble in continuing their research due to the difficulty of securing <b>graduate</b> <b>students.</b> A continuous stream of <b>graduate</b> <b>students</b> is critical for the operation of university laboratories, as well as for proper career management of <b>graduate</b> <b>students</b> involved in their supervisors’ research projects. Further, a strongly unequal distribution of research resources (i.e., <b>graduate</b> <b>students</b> and funding) would, in the long run, negatively affect the knowledge production of the larger academic community.|$|R
