40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} I propose and formalize {{a theory of}} the mass-count {{distinction}} in which the <b>denotations</b> of count nouns are built from non-overlapping generators, while the <b>denotations</b> of mass nouns are built from overlapping generators. Counting is counting of generators, and it will follow that counting is only correct on count <b>denotations.</b> I will show that the theory allows two kinds of mass nouns: mess mass nouns with <b>denotations</b> built from overlapping minimal generators, and neat mass nouns with <b>denotations</b> built from overlapping generators, where the overlap is not located in the minimal generators. Prototypical mass nouns like meat and mud are of the first kind. I will argue that mass nouns like furniture and kitchenware are of the second type. I will discuss several phenomena—all involving {{one way or the}} other explicitly or implicitly individual classifiers lik...|$|R

25|$|Those {{who favor}} the non-sexual {{interpretation}} argue against a <b>denotation</b> {{of sexual behavior}} in this context, noting that while the Hebrew word for know appears over 900 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, only approximately 1% (13–14 times) of those references is it clearly used as a euphemism for realizing sexual intimacy. Instead, those who hold to this interpretation usually see the demand to know as demanding the right to interrogate the strangers.|$|E
25|$|A {{representation}} {{is a type}} of recording in which the sensory information about a physical object is described in a medium. The degree to which an artistic representation resembles the object it represents is a function of resolution and does not bear on the <b>denotation</b> of the word. For example, both the Mona Lisa and a child's crayon drawing of Lisa del Giocondo would be considered representational, and any preference for one over the other would need to be understood as a matter of aesthetics.|$|E
25|$|Appiah {{argues that}} the {{formative}} <b>denotation</b> of culture is ultimately preceded by the efficacy of intellectual interchange. From this position, his views on the efficacy of organizations such as UNICEF and Oxfam are notable for their duality: {{on the one hand}} he seems to appreciate the immediate action these organizations provide while on the other hand he points out the long-term futility of such intervention. His focus is, instead, on the long-term political and economic development of nations according to the Western capitalist/ democratic model, an approach that relies on continued growth in the “marketplace” that is the capital-driven modern world.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an extension of}} the semantic grammars used in conventional statistical spoken language interfaces to allow the probabilities of derived analyses to be conditioned on the meanings or <b>denotations</b> of input utterances {{in the context of an}} interface's underlying application environment or world model. Since these <b>denotations</b> will be used to guide disambiguation in interactive applications, they must be ef- ciently shared among the many possible analyses that may be assigned to an input utterance. This paper therefore presents a formal restriction on the scope of variables in a semantic grammar which guarantees that the <b>denotations</b> of all possible analyses of an input utterance can be calculated in polynomial time, without undue constraints on the expressivity of the derived semantics. Empirical tests show that this model-theoretic interpretation yields a statistically signi cant improvement on standard measures of parsing accuracy over a baseline grammar not conditioned on <b>denotations...</b>|$|R
25|$|Semantics is {{the branch}} of {{linguistics}} that examines the meaning of natural language, the notion of reference and <b>denotation,</b> {{and the concept of}} possible worlds. One concept used in the study of semantics is predicate logic, which is a system that uses symbols and alphabet letters to represent the overall meaning of a sentence. Quantifiers in semantics – such as the quantifier in the antecedent of a bound variable pronoun – can be expressed in two ways. There is an existential quantifier, ∃, meaning some. There is also a universal quantifier, ∀, meaning every, each, or all. Ambiguity arises when there are multiple quantifiers in one sentence.|$|E
25|$|Extension × intension = information. Two {{traditional}} {{approaches to}} sign relation, necessary though insufficient, {{are the way}} of extension (a sign's objects, also called breadth, <b>denotation,</b> or application) and the way of intension (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, comprehension, significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of information, including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole. For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies.|$|E
25|$|A {{family is}} indexed by an index set. In {{the case of}} a family of {{operations}} forming an algebra, the indices are called operation symbols, constituting the language of that algebra. The operation indexed by each symbol is called the <b>denotation</b> or interpretation of that symbol. Each operation symbol specifies the arity of its interpretation, whence all possible interpretations of a symbol have the same arity. In general it is possible for an algebra to interpret distinct symbols with the same operation, {{but this is not the}} case for the prototype, whose symbols are in one-one correspondence with its operations. The prototype therefore has 22n n-ary operation symbols, called the Boolean operation symbols and forming the language of Boolean algebra. Only a few operations have conventional symbols, such as ¬ for negation, ∧ for conjunction, and ∨ for disjunction. It is convenient to consider the i-th n-ary symbol to be n'f'i as done below in the section on truth tables.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} devoted to the {{methodology}} of using denotational techniques in software design. Since <b>denotations</b> describe the essential components comprising a system and syntax provides ways for the user to access and communicate with these components, we suggest that <b>denotations</b> be developed {{in the first place and}} that syntax be derived from them later. That viewpoint is opposite to the traditional (descriptive) style where denotational techniques are used in assigning a meaning to some earlier defined syntax. Our methodology is discussed on an algebraic ground where both <b>denotations</b> and syntax constitute many-sorted algebras and where denotational semantics is a homomorphism between them. On that ground the construction of a denotational model of a software system may be regarded as a derivation of a sequence of algebras. We discuss some mathematical techniques which may support that process especially this part where syntax is derived from <b>denotations.</b> The suggested methodology is illustrated on two small examples...|$|R
25|$|In the 1880s, the British {{arrived with}} Cecil Rhodes's British South Africa Company. In 1898, the name Southern Rhodesia was adopted. In 1888, British {{colonialist}} Cecil Rhodes obtained a concession for mining rights from King Lobengula of the Ndebele peoples. Cecil Rhodes presented this concession {{to persuade the}} government of the United Kingdom to grant a royal charter to his British South Africa Company (BSAC) over Matabeleland, and its subject states such as Mashonaland. Rhodes sought permission to negotiate similar concessions covering all territory between the Limpopo River and Lake Tanganyika, then known as 'Zambesia'. In accordance with the terms of aforementioned concessions and treaties, Cecil Rhodes promoted the colonisation of the region's land, with British control over labour as well as precious metals and other mineral resources. In 1895 the BSAC adopted the name 'Rhodesia' for the territory of Zambesia, in honour of Cecil Rhodes. In 1898 'Southern Rhodesia' became the official <b>denotation</b> for the region south of the Zambezi, which later became Zimbabwe. The region to the north was administered separately by the BSAC and later named Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia).|$|E

40|$|The best extant {{demarcation}} {{of logical}} constants, due to Tarski, classifies logical con- stants by invariance properties of their <b>denotations.</b> This classification is {{developed in a}} framework which presumes that the <b>denotations</b> of all expressions are definite. However, some indefinite expressions, such as Russell’s indefinite description operator η, Hilbert’s ε, and abstraction operators such as ‘the number of’, appropriately in- terpreted, are logical. I generalize the Tarskian framework {{in such a way}} as to allow a reasonable account of the <b>denotations</b> of indefinite expressions. This account gives rise to a principled classification of the <b>denotations</b> of logical and non-logical indefi- nite expressions. After developing this classification and its application to particular cases in some detail, I show how this generalized framework allows a novel view of the logical status of certain abstraction operators such as ‘the number of’.

500|$|After an {{unauthorized}} paperback edition of The Lord of the Rings appeared from Ace Books in 1965, Houghton Mifflin and Ballantine asked Tolkien to refresh {{the text of}} The Hobbit to renew the US copyright. This text became the 1966 third edition. Tolkien {{took the opportunity to}} align the narrative even more closely to The Lord of the Rings and to cosmological developments from his still unpublished Quenta Silmarillion as it stood at that time. These small edits included, for example, changing the phrase [...] "elves that are now called Gnomes" [...] from the first and second editions on page 63, to [...] "High Elves of the West, my kin" [...] in the third edition. Tolkien had used [...] "gnome" [...] in his earlier writing to refer to the second kindred of the High Elves—the Noldor (or [...] "Deep Elves")—thinking [...] "gnome", derived from the Greek gnosis (knowledge), was a good name for the wisest of the elves. However, because of its common <b>denotation</b> of a garden gnome, derived from the 16th-century Paracelsus, Tolkien abandoned the term.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of Sayyid {{believe they are}} one of the modern day descendants of Muhammad, and that they are therefore the descendants of Ishmael and his second son Qedar. Abu Ja'far al-Baqir (676–743 CE) wrote that his father Ali ibn Husayn informed him that Mohammed had said: [...] "The first whose tongue spoke in clear Arabic was Ishmael, when he was fourteen years old." [...] Hisham Ibn Muhammad al-Kalbi (737–819 CE) established a genealogical link between Ishmael and Mohammed using writings that drew on biblical and Palmyran sources, and the ancient oral traditions of the Arabs. His book, Jamharat al-Nasab ("The Abundance of Kinship"), seems to posit that the people known as [...] "Arabs" [...] are all descendants of Ishmael. Ibn Kathir (1301–1373) writes, [...] "All the Arabs of the Hijaz are descendants of Nebaioth and Qedar." [...] Medieval Jewish sources also usually identified Qedar with Arabs and/or Muslims. According to author and scholar Irfan Shahîd, Western scholars viewed this kind of [...] "genealogical Ishmaelism" [...] with suspicion, seeing it as, [...] a late Islamic fabrication because of the confusion in Islamic times which made it such a capacious term as to include the inhabitants of the south as well as the north of the Arabian Peninsula. But shorn of this extravagance, the concept is much more modest in its <b>denotation,</b> and in the sober sources it applies only to certain groups among the Arabs of pre-Islamic times. Some important statements to this effect were made by [...] Muhammed when he identified some Arabs as Ishmaelites and others as not. Ishmaelism in this more limited definition holds that Ishmael was both an important religious figure and eponymous ancestor for some of the Arabs of western Arabia. Prominence is given in Arab genealogical accounts to the first two of Ishmael's twelve sons, Nebaioth ( [...] , Nabīt) and Qedar ( [...] , Qaydār), who are also prominently featured in the Genesis account. It is likely that they and their tribes lived in northwestern Arabia and were historically the most important of the twelve Ishamelite tribes.|$|E
