5|$|Baltimore was <b>far</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> {{the most}} {{successful}} of any American CFL team {{on the field and}} off, averaging crowds of over 37,000 their first year. Knowing that Canadian football was considerably different from the American game, Speros stocked the Stallions mostly with CFL veterans. As coach, he brought in Don Matthews, who had already played in two Grey Cups and won one. The result was a team that eventually finished second in the East with a 12–6 record and became the first American team to qualify for the playoffs. They advanced {{all the way to the}} Grey Cup. In a thrilling match played in BC Place, the BC Lions defeated the Stallions on a last second field goal. Perhaps most remarkably, they were reported to have turned a profit in their first year after an initial US$7 million investment by Speros.|$|E

5|$|With few teams, but a long history, it is {{inevitable}} that intense rivalries have developed in Canadian football. <b>Far</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> the greatest Toronto Argonauts rivalry has been with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and its precursor teams. Fittingly, the Argonauts first game was against a club from Hamilton, while the raucous Eastern Final of 2013—featuring a Tiger-Cat win over the Argos in front of 35,000 at the Rogers Centre—proved the rivalry is alive and well. The two teams meet in Hamilton every year in the Labour Day Classic, a league wide tradition since the late 1940s in which the game's greatest rivalries are showcased.|$|E

Plowing was by means of wooden plows with iron shares; corn was planted by hand and covered using a hoe.

25|$|<b>Far</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> {{the most}} common mode by which a case reaches the Supreme Court is through an appeal from a {{decision}} rendered by a lower court. Appealed cases generally originate from lawsuits or criminal indictments filed and tried before the trial courts.

Apart from decisions of the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court may also directly review on appeal decisions rendered by the Sandiganbayan and the Court of Tax Appeals. Decisions rendered by administrative agencies are not directly appealable to the Supreme Court, they must be first challenged before the Court of Appeals. However, decisions of the Commission on Elections may be elevated directly for review to the Supreme Court, although the procedure is not, strictly speaking, {{in the nature of}} an appeal.|$|E
