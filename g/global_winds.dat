5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to <b>global</b> <b>winds</b> resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.|$|E

The mesoscale components of surf breaks are the ramp, platform, wedge, or ledge that may be present at a surf break. Macroscale processes are the <b>global</b> <b>winds</b> that initially produce offshore waves. Types of surf breaks are headlands (point break), beach break, river/estuary entrance bar, reef breaks, and ledge breaks.|$|E

5000|$|During the Last Glacial Maximum, much of {{the world}} was cold, dry, and inhospitable, with {{frequent}} storms and a dust-laden atmosphere. The dustiness of the atmosphere is a prominent feature in ice cores; dust levels were as much as 20 to 25 times greater than now. [...] This was probably due to a number of factors: reduced vegetation, stronger <b>global</b> <b>winds,</b> and less precipitation to clear dust from the atmosphere. The massive sheets of ice locked away water, lowering the sea level, exposing continental shelves, joining land masses together, and creating extensive coastal plains. During the last glacial maximum, 21,000 years ago, the sea level was about 125 meters (about 410 feet) lower than it is today.|$|E

40|$|By {{means of}} high {{resolution}} 2 D hydrodynamical simulations, we study {{the evolution of}} the hot ISM for a large set of early-type galaxy models, characterized by various degrees of flattening and internal rotation. The galaxies are described by state-of-the-art axisymmetric two-component models, tailored to reproduce real systems; the dark matter haloes follow the Navarro-Frenk-White or the Einasto profile. The gas is produced by the evolving stars, and heated by Type Ia SNe. We find that, in general, the rotation field of the ISM in rotating galaxies is very {{similar to that of the}} stars, with a consequent negligible heating contribution from thermalization of the ordered motions. The relative importance of flattening and rotation in determining the final X-ray luminosity $L_x$ and temperature $T_x$ of the hot haloes is a function of the galactic mass. Flattening and rotation in low mass galaxies favour the establishment of <b>global</b> <b>winds,</b> with the consequent reduction of $L_x$. In medium-to-high mass galaxies, flattening and rotation are not sufficient to induce <b>global</b> <b>winds,</b> however, in the rotating models the nature of the gas flows is deeply affected by conservation of angular momentum, resulting in a reduction of both $L_x$ and $T_x$.

40|$|The {{superpressure}} balloon {{was developed}} to provide a method of obtaining <b>global</b> <b>winds</b> at all altitudes from 5 to 30 km. If a balloon {{could be made to}} fly for several weeks at a constant altitude, and if it could be tracked accurately on its global circuits, the balloon would provide a tag for the air parcel in which it was embedded. The Lagrangian data on the atmospheric circulation would provide a superior data input to the numerical model. The Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) was initiated in large part based on the promise of this technique coupled with free-floating ocean buoys and satellite radiometers. The initial name proposed by Charney for GARP was SABABURA 'SAtellite BAlloon BUoy RAdiometric system' (Charney, 1966). However, although the superpressure balloon exceeded its designers' expectations for flight duration in the stratosphere (longest flight duration of 744 days), flight duration below 10 km was limited by icing in super-cooled clouds to a few days. The balloon was relegated to a secondary role during the GARP Special Observing Periods.
