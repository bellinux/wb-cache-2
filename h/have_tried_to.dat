5|$|Based on the letter, {{some historians}} <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> date the {{so-called}} Second Swedish Crusade to 1238 or 1239, listing it as Thomas' accomplishments as well.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the first}} {{historical}} figure of importance in Finland, historians <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> attribute more significance to Thomas {{than what is}} evident from the existing sources.|$|E
5|$|In response, {{official}} celebrations <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> include Indigenous people, holding ceremonies {{such as the}} Woggan-ma-gule ceremony, held in Sydney, which honours {{the past}} and celebrates the present.|$|E

50|$|Foster {{disputed the}} paper's {{claims that he}} <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> sell his story to Granada Television, though the Press Complaints Commission {{concluded}} that as he <b>had</b> appeared <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> sell the story any inaccuracy about the company he <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> sell the story to was not significant.|$|R
50|$|The {{report has}} also {{affected}} behaviour. A YouGov survey, commissioned by WCRF UK {{a year after}} the launch, revealed that since the launch 23 per cent of people <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> eat more fruit and vegetables {{as a result of the}} report; 18 per cent of people <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> watch their weight and 18 per cent of people <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> be more physically active.|$|R
5|$|Travel in the Toposa {{country was}} {{dangerous}} without a large armed escort, {{and if the}} Ethiopians had got word of the survey they would <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> occupy {{that part of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|Another {{significant}} human {{impact is}} roadkill—dead turtles, especially females, are commonly seen on summer roads. In addition to direct killing, roads genetically isolate some populations. Localities <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> limit roadkill by constructing underpasses, highway barriers, and crossing signs. Oregon has introduced public education on turtle awareness, safe swerving, and safely assisting turtles across the road.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs have {{recently}} experienced habitat loss, chytrid diseases, and collection for the pet trade. Some {{are listed as}} threatened or endangered as a result. Zoos <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> counteract this disease by treating captive frogs with an antifungal agent {{that is used to}} cure athlete's foot in humans.|$|E
50|$|The journal {{for which}} he became known {{was not the first}} he <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> keep; he <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> write one at age 17 to chronicle a romantic relationship, but {{abandoned}} it after losing interest in the project.|$|R
50|$|The New York Times {{reported}} in 2009 that Murphy <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> persuade the buyer of his neighbor's house {{to buy his}} house instead. According to the article, the effort failed and his neighbor found out what he <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|R

Also, several artists <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> produce a realistic portrait of Marko {{based on his}} frescoes. In 1924 Prilep Brewery introduced a light beer, Krali Marko.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{with the}} European Union in 2014 have {{increased}} both unions to pressure post-Soviet states {{to join their}} integration unions. Both sides have accused each other of carving spheres of influence. Members of the union, especially Russia <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> diversify their trade by signing economic agreements with China, Iran and Turkey. Trade with North and South Korea has also risen.|$|E

5|$|As La Dispute have {{promoted}} {{their music}} on headline tours they <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> create a play different songs {{and create a}} different experience for each live show. They have also used songs after {{a certain period of}} time: an example is 'King Park', which although was initially considered too emotionally draining for live performances, the band eventually started to play the song live. The band played 'St Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' from Wildlife at its first performance in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|From the {{conflicting}} {{accounts of the}} sources, historians <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> reconstruct the most likely sequence of {{events leading up to}} the battle. It is probable that Olaf Tryggvason was indeed sailing from Wendland to Norway when he was ambushed, though the kings' sagas probably play up the importance of Thyri and her marriages. While it is possible that Olaf was collecting dowry, it seems more probable that he was expecting war and seeking allies in Wendland, but met with little success. The character of Sigvaldi remains enigmatic, though there is evidence from skaldic poetry that he did indeed betray Olaf.|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{most likely}} a brown dwarf, a massive object that {{is large enough to}} fuse {{deuterium}} (something that planets are too small to do) but not large enough to ignite and become a star. Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend the line between {{whether or not it is}} a brown dwarf or a planet, astronomers <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner.|$|E

50|$|Lewsyn yr Heliwr's {{sentence}} was downgraded {{to a life}} sentence and penal transportation to Australia {{when one of the}} police officers who <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> disperse the crowd testified that he <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> shield him from the rioters.

5|$|He would <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> reconquer the {{province}} {{if he had}} the resources, but now he had neither the men nor the money to defend {{the province}} any more. Instead he retreated to the cathedral of Antioch, where he observed a solemn service of intercession. He summoned a meeting of his advisers at the cathedral and scrutinized the situation. He was told almost unanimously, and accepted the fact, that the defeat was God's decision and a result of the sins {{of the people of the}} land, including him. Heraclius took to the sea on a ship to Constantinople in the night.|$|E
5|$|In 371, the Emperor Valens split Cappadocia {{into two}} new provinces, Cappadocia Prima and Cappadocia Secunda. This {{resulted}} in complex changes in ecclesiastical boundaries, during which several new bishoprics were created. Gregory was elected {{bishop of the}} new see of Nyssa in 372, presumably {{with the support of}} his brother Basil, who was metropolitan of Caesarea. Gregory's early policies as bishop often went against those of Basil : for instance, while his brother condemned the Sabellianist followers of Marcellus of Ancyra as heretics, Gregory may <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> reconcile them with the church.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Suillus americanus has {{a similar}} appearance, but a more easterly distribution. It is {{associated}} with eastern white pine. Although some authors <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between the two with by using width of the stem, or by differences in fruit body colouration, it is acknowledged that these characteristics are variable, and depend on environmental factors. The phylogenetic analysis of Wu and colleagues (2000) suggests that the two taxa may be the same, although more samples from different geographical areas {{will be needed to}} verify this.|$|E

5|$|Philip had no {{intention}} of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as if he was just delaying the transfer of the city. He seems to have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> {{reconcile the}} conflicting {{accounts of the}} Chronicle and the De administrando imperio as implying a first recovery of Patras c. 805 {{as the result of}} Skleros' campaign, which was probably concurrent with the establishment of the Peloponnese as a separate theme from Hellas, if this had not been done slightly earlier. According to this interpretation, the Slavic revolt and attack on Patras followed as a reaction a few years later, between 807 and 811.|$|E
