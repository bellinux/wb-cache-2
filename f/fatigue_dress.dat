6000|$|The {{wonder of}} the book is its {{superior}} intelligence. In the menstruum of this man's wit, {{the past and the present}} ages, and their religions, politics, and modes of thinking, are dissolved into archetypes and ideas. What new mythologies sail through his head! The Greeks said, that Alexander went as far as Chaos; Goethe went, only the other day, as far; and one step farther he hazarded, and brought himself safe back. There is a heart-cheering freedom in his speculation. The immense horizon which journeys with us lends its majesties to trifles, and to matters of convenience and necessity, as to solemn and festal performances. He was the soul of his century. If that was learned, and had become, by population, compact organization, and drill of parts, one great Exploring Expedition, accumulating a glut of facts and fruits too fast for any hitherto-existing savants to classify, this man's mind had ample chambers for the distribution of all. He had a power to unite the detached atoms again by their own law. He has clothed our modern existence with poetry. Amid littleness and detail, he detected the Genius of life, the old cunning Proteus, nestling close beside us, and showed that the dullness and prose we ascribe to the age was only another of his masks:--"His very flight is presence in disguise:" [...] that he had put off a gay uniform for a <b>fatigue</b> <b>dress,</b> and was not a whit less vivacious or rich in Liverpool or the Hague, than once in Rome or Antioch. He sought him in public squares and main streets, in boulevards and hotels; and, in the solidest kingdom of routine and the senses, he showed the lurking daemonic power; that, in actions of routine, a thread of mythology and fable spins itself; and this, by tracing the pedigree of every usage and practice, every institution, utensil, and means, home to its origin in the structure of man. He had an extreme impatience of conjecture, and of rhetoric. [...] "I have guesses enough of my own; if a man write a book, let him set down only what he knows." [...] He writes in the plainest and lowest tone, omitting a great deal more than he writes, and putting ever a thing for a word. He has explained the distinction between the antique and the modern spirit and art. He has defined art, its scope and laws. He has said the best things about nature that ever were said. He treats nature as the old philosophers, as the seven wise masters did,--and, with whatever loss of French tabulation and dissection, poetry and humanity remain to us; and they have some doctorial skill. Eyes are better, on the whole, than telescopes or microscopes. He has contributed a key to many parts of nature, through the rare turn for unity and simplicity in his mind. Thus Goethe suggested the leading idea of modern botany, that a leaf, or the eye of a leaf, is the unit of botany, and that every part of the plant is only a transformed leaf to meet a new condition; and, by varying the conditions, a leaf may be converted into any other organ, and any other organ into a leaf. In like manner, in osteology, he assumed that one vertebra of the spine might be considered the unit of the skeleton; the head was only the uppermost vertebra transformed. [...] "The plant goes from knot to knot, closing, at last, with the flower and the seed. So the tape-worm, the caterpillar, goes from knot to knot, and closes with the head. Men and the higher animals are built up through the vertebrae, the powers being concentrated in the head." [...] In optics, again, he rejected the artificial theory of seven colors, and considered that every color was the mixture of light and darkness in new proportions. It is really of very little consequence what topic he writes upon. He sees at every pore, and has a certain gravitation toward truth. He will realize what you say. He hates to be trifled with, and to be made to say over again some old wife's fable, that has had possession of men's faith these thousand years. He may as well see if it is true as another. He sifts it. I am here, he would say, to be the measure and judge of these things. Why should I take them on trust? And, therefore, what he says of religion, of passion, of marriage, of manners, property, of paper money, of periods or beliefs, of omens, of luck, or whatever else, refuses to be forgotten.|$|E

60|$|Fortunately for Violet, Theodora {{had found}} her so much {{exhausted}} by the <b>fatigue</b> of <b>dressing,</b> that she thought it safest, considering what a bride it was, not to divulge her presence in the house; and she came down with this intelligence, trying to compensate for it by civility, and by showing the children.|$|R

5000|$|The uniform {{was also}} {{described}} by the unit commander to the governor of Georgia as follows: [...] "Our Dress uniform is a dress coat of dark green broad cloth, with gilt rifle buttons, and trimmed with gold lace and cord on the outside seams; cap of dark green with letters 'C.R.' surrounded with a gold wreath, light green pompon; wings of brass, army style. Our <b>fatigue</b> <b>dress</b> consists of a dark green cloth jacket, trimmed with gold lace, green cap and black pants." ...|$|E
50|$|This was {{basically}} a khaki cotton version of the 1886 uniform with a shorter jacket. First appearing as a <b>fatigue</b> <b>dress</b> in 1900, it was being issued as a hot-weather uniform in 1904 to replace the white summer clothing described above. The practical advantages of khaki drill over dark blue became obvious in the opening stages of the Russo-Japanese War and it became general issue for troops on active service as stocks became available. In 1906 a khaki serge cold-weather uniform and greatcoat had also been adopted.|$|E

The clothing received included serge jacket and trousers, a set of blue linen for <b>fatigue</b> <b>dress,</b> a full dress tunic, peak caps of a naval pattern, helmets for ceremonial drill and warm weather work, and chevrons and badges for the staff sergeants, sergeants, corporals, bandsmen and buglers.|$|E
50|$|Paintball {{clothing}} {{needs to}} be tough and durable. For woodsball, camouflage clothing is effective for blending in with the environment; players may wear army surplus military <b>fatigues,</b> Battle <b>Dress</b> Uniform (BDU), Army Combat Uniform (ACU) or DPM styles. For speedball, however, the small field and artificial obstacles make camouflage ineffective; players therefore will often choose to wear a brightly coloured team uniform for ease of identification. For scenario games, players will tend to dress themselves in a style appropriate to the character or force they are representing. In order to minimize the sting of close-range hits, players often wear extra layers of clothing padding as well.|$|R
5|$|The {{headgear}} of {{the typical}} Confederate Infantryman was the slouch hat, or the military Kepi. The Kepi is a short <b>fatigue</b> and <b>dress</b> cap that was easy to manufacture for the Army during the war. This type of hat had its drawbacks, however. It provided little weather protection, and was worn out easily {{after a few months}} of hard wear. The Infantryman design cap was sky-blue with a dark blue band, but this was rarely seen outside of officer private-purchase caps. More typical would be the plain gray/brown cap, with or without the branch of service trim. There are examples of deep-south made caps that were trimmed in red cotton and wool, and issued to Infantry units, showing that any available clothing was issued to the troops as the war progressed.|$|R
60|$|The surgeon saw him, and {{declared}} {{him so much}} better that he might soon be taken home, recommending his sitting up {{for a little while}} as a first stage. Peregrine, however, seemed far from being cheered, and showed himself so unwilling to undergo the <b>fatigue</b> of being <b>dressed,</b> even when good Dr. Woodford had brought up his own large chair--the only approach to an easy one in the house--that the proposal was dropped, and he was left in peace {{for the rest of the}} day.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to 1914 {{the most}} {{commonly}} worn uniform of these units was white <b>fatigue</b> <b>dress</b> with white covered kepi and blue waist sash. The medium blue greatcoat of the French infantry was worn on the march. A full dress uniform of dark blue tunic and red trousers (white in hot weather) could be worn on parade or for off-duty wear. From World War I on the Bat' d'Af' were distinguished by [...] "violet" [...] (light purple/red) collar patch braiding and numbers on their khaki drill uniforms. Khaki pith helmets appeared during the 1920s and 30s {{as an alternative to}} the kepi, which itself could be worn with khaki or white covers according to the occasion. White dress uniforms were reserved for cadres.|$|E
5000|$|From its {{foundation}} until World War I the Foreign Legion normally wore {{the uniform of}} the French line infantry for parade with a few special distinctions. Essentially this consisted of a dark blue coat (later tunic) worn with red trousers. The field uniform was often modified {{under the influence of}} the extremes of climate and terrain in which the Foreign Legion served. Shakos were soon replaced by the light cloth kepi, which was far more suitable for North African conditions. The practice of wearing heavy capotes (greatcoats) on the march and vestes (short hip-length jackets) as working dress in barracks was followed by the Foreign Legion from its establishment.One short lived aberration was the wearing of green uniforms in 1856 by Foreign Legion units recruited in Switzerland for service in the Crimean War. In the Crimea itself (1854-59) a hooded coat and red or blue waist sashes were adopted for winter dress, while during the Mexican Intervention (1863-65) straw hats or sombreros were sometimes substituted for the kepi. When the latter was worn it was usually covered with a white [...] "havelock" [...] - the predecessor of the white kepi that was to become a symbol of the Foreign Legion. Foreign Legion units serving in France during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 were distinguishable only by minor details of insignia from the bulk of the French infantry. However subsequent colonial campaigns saw an increasing use of special garments for hot weather wear such as collarless keo blouses in Tonkin 1884-85, khaki drill jackets in Dahomey (1892) and drab covered topees worn with all-white <b>fatigue</b> <b>dress</b> in Madagascar (1895).|$|E
50|$|The {{uniform of}} the Petersburg Grays was copied from the 7th New York Infantry (militia), and as such evolved from the tail coat to the frock coat during the 1850s.One image {{of a member of}} the company from 1861, (Private Donald McKenzie Dunlop,) depicts him in both the Dress uniform and the fatigue uniform. It can be assumed that this uniform may be worn company-wide, as the {{original}} unit comprised the middle and upper classes of the city; however, it is possible that this man could have been one of only a few to wear the uniform. Here is what the dress uniform image shows:The frockcoat is Cadet Grey, being the lighter shade found in VMI and West Point Academy uniforms, 9 button front, the collar has black or navy blue piping along the edge, and gold lace either 3/8‚Äù or ¬Ω‚Äù with approx. ¬Ω‚Äù-3/4‚Äù space in the center, and a 7/8‚Äù is {{at the rear of the}} lace, three gold or yellow squares adorn the cuffs, with a 7/8‚Äù button in the center of each square:White accoutrement straps, (the image, despite the clarity of it, is not fine enough to show whether or not Pvt. Dunlop wears leather or cotton straps and belting,) the white accoutrement straps have a brass, circular, (not oval) center plate; he wears the 1850 or 1860 pattern VA state militia belt plate;He wears epaulettes, either navy blue or black boards, with white fringe, 2.5-3‚Äù long;The image also shows the shako, very similar to the 1861 US artillery or the U.S.M.A. pattern, with the 1821 eagle device on the front, toward the crown, a large wreath (approx. 3-4‚Äù in width) with a large gothic B in the center,(indicating that the image may have been taken between 1859-1861), and a pompom, barely visible, being black or navy blue:The trousers he wears also has a wide stripe down the center, being 1.5‚Äù-2‚Äù in width, the exact pattern cannot be determined from the image, as the skirt of the coat covers most of the trousers.The second image shows the same man in the <b>fatigue</b> <b>dress,</b> most likely worn under the coat.A forage cap, being navy blue, or black, (one description read dark and light greys used, similar to the 13th VA Inf. Cap,) in the McDowell design, the center disc being smaller in proportion than the US Regulation 1858 cap, the brim is shined, possibly lacquered:The battle shirt worn is of a lighter shade material than the coat and trousers, with a stand and fall collar, no color trim, 6-7 button front, small buttons are used (possibly civilian), two low set pockets, and a cravat is worn:He wears the 11 button suspender pattern trousers, however, the pockets and seams cannot be seen in this image, so as to give reference to the source of his uniform.|$|E
60|$|The {{marriage}} {{proved a}} very happy one, but the household duties of the bride were extremely irksome. It <b>fatigued</b> her to <b>dress</b> the beeves for dinner; it nearly broke her back to black her lord's boots without any scaffolding. It took her all day to perform any kindly little office for him. But she bore it all uncomplainingly, until one morning {{he asked her to}} part his back hair; then the bent sapling of her spirit flew up and hit him in the face. She gathered up some French novels, and retired to a lonely tower to breathe out her soul in unavailing regrets.|$|R
6000|$|Kezia {{was equal}} to the task. Having {{declared}} her intention of staying till the master could get about again, [...] "wage or no wage," [...] she had found a certain recompense in keeping a strong hand over her mistress, scolding her for [...] "moithering" [...] herself, and going about all day without changing her cap, and looking {{as if she was}} [...] "mushed." [...] Altogether, this time of trouble was rather a Saturnalian time to Kezia; she could scold her betters with unreproved freedom. On this particular occasion there were drying clothes to be fetched in; she wished to know if one pair of hands could do everything in-doors and out, and observed that she should have thought {{it would be good for}} Mrs. Tulliver to put on her bonnet, and get a breath of fresh air by doing that needful piece of work. Poor Mrs. Tulliver went submissively downstairs; to be ordered about by a servant was the last remnant of her household dignities,--she would soon have no servant to scold her. Mr. Tulliver was resting in his chair a little after the <b>fatigue</b> of <b>dressing,</b> and Maggie and Tom were seated near him, when Luke entered to ask if he should help master downstairs.|$|R
60|$|That {{evening after}} dinner {{he had a}} return of the dizziness, {{though he did not}} faint. He would not ring the bell, because he knew it would mean a fuss, and make his going up on the morrow more conspicuous. When one grew old, the whole world was in {{conspiracy}} to limit freedom, and for what reason?--just to keep the breath in him a little longer. He did not want it at such cost. Only the dog Balthasar saw his lonely recovery from that weakness; anxiously watched his master go to the sideboard and drink some brandy, instead of giving him a biscuit. When at last old Jolyon felt able to tackle the stairs he went up to bed. And, though still shaky next morning, the thought of the evening sustained and strengthened him. It was always such a pleasure to give her a good dinner--he suspected her of undereating when she was alone; and, at the opera to watch her eyes glow and brighten, the unconscious smiling of her lips. She hadn't much pleasure, and this was the last time {{he would be able to}} give her that treat. But when he was packing his bag he caught himself wishing that he had not the <b>fatigue</b> of <b>dressing</b> for dinner before him, and the exertion, too, of telling her about June's return.|$|R
5000|$|Formerly, from 1976 to 1991, this {{grade was}} divided into ranks with {{separate}} titles: sergeant (referred to unofficially but almost universally within the USAF as [...] "Buck Sergeant" [...] or simply [...] "Buck"), a non-commissioned officer; and Senior Airman, which {{is the equivalent of}} Specialist, a non-supervisory rank. Senior Airmen were promoted to Sergeant after 12 months' time in grade and completion of the now-defunct Non-Commissioned Officer Preparatory Course. This schism reflected a desire by the Air Force in 1976 to subdivide enlisted ranks into a three-tier organization, a move which was resisted by the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, resulting in the compromise dual-rank that lasted fifteen years. The last Air Force promotions to Sergeant were effective 1 April 1991. Those personnel who had been promoted to Sergeant prior to this cut off date retained the rank until being promoted to a higher rank or leaving the service. There are no longer any personnel on active duty who hold this rank. Due to high year of tenure rules in effect at the time, the last person to hold the rank was forced out of the Air Force on 23 March 1998. Sergeants wore the same chevrons as present-day senior airmen. Senior airmen wore similar chevrons, but with a blue (green on the <b>fatigue</b> or battle <b>dress</b> uniform) subdued central star, as did all airmen in the lowest tier.|$|R
5000|$|An attempt {{dating from}} the early 1950s to provide other British {{soldiers}} with a plainer (and cheaper) dark blue or green No.1 dress did not meet with much enthusiasm; indeed, most soldiers are not issued with their own No.1 dress, and the most common occasion when it is now worn is for a wedding. Parade dress for most British regiments is khaki No. 2 dress with No 1 Dress coloured peaked caps, berets or Glengarry bonnets. Following {{the introduction of the}} Combat Soldier 95 (CS95) clothing system of Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) this is worn for most day-to-day business replacing the old 'working' uniform of green Lightweight Trousers and Shirt/Jersey, albeit that these are still used as 'Barrack Dress' by some office based personnel. However, the proposed Future Army Dress (FAD), which is currently being developed by the British Army, includes a return to Barrack Dress for all arms, including 'non-iron' shirts and trousers in a similar pattern to that of the current No.2 Dress uniform. Tradition is however still strong in British military culture and there are many regimental distinctions added to some uniforms. One example is the King's Royal Hussars who wear their historic crimson trousers with all orders other than <b>fatigue</b> or combat <b>dress.</b> The [...] "trews" [...] or tartan trousers of Lowland regiments have been retained for certain orders of dress in the amalgamated Royal Regiment of Scotland, although the kilt of the Highland regiments is the parade dress. Mess dress in traditional scarlet, blue or green is worn by officers and senior NCOs of all regiments for formal evening dress.|$|R
