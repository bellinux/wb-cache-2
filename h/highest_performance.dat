Both designs featured huge wing tip fuel tanks that could be jettisoned when their fuel was depleted before a supersonic dash to the target. The tanks also included the outer portions of the wing, which would also be jettisoned to produce a smaller wing suitable for supersonic speeds. Both became trapezoidal wings after ejection, at that time the <b>highest</b> <b>performance</b> planform known. They also featured flush cockpits to maintain the highest fineness ratio possible in spite of its effects on visibility.|$|E

After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 {{as director of the}} Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler—who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post—experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press. Nevertheless, his innovative productions and insistence on the <b>highest</b> <b>performance</b> standards ensured his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky.

40|$|As the {{discipline}} of sport management matures, <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> sport management emerges as a swiftly developing branch of knowledge. The <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> industry and sport practitioners are leading the way by adopting practices that recognise the significance of managing <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> sport. Indicative of these practices is also the recognition and establishment {{of the role of}} <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> directors on athlete performance. These shifts in industry practices (i. e., hiring <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> directors and placing an emphasis on <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> management practices) have not been matched with an equivalent focus of academic inquiry that would help define the field, distinguish it from other fields and illustrate its significance in empirical ways. Chapter 1, written by Popi Sotiriadou, represents the start of an inquiry into defining {{the discipline}} of managing <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> sport and the roles of <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> directors in athlete success. The funnel of HPSM is comprised of three interrelated components; (a) <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> management (Part A of this book), (b) managing <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> athletes (Part B of this book), and (c) issues in <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> sport (Part C of this book). The funnel of HPSM implies that athlete performance (at the lowest part of Figure A) is a factor of all three components. Unquestionably, performances at top-level sports are the result of a combination of the broader environmental and physical circumstances in which people live; the opportunities they are offered to excel through sport systems; and the genetic qualities they are born with and other athlete related issues. Accordingly, the factors that contribute to international sporting success can be classified at three different levels. The macro-level (Part A: <b>High</b> <b>Performance</b> Management), the meso-level (Part B: Managing <b>High</b> <b>Performance</b> Athletes) and the micro level (Part C: Issues in <b>High</b> <b>Performance</b> Sport).

25|$|Certain {{educational}} organizations {{viewed the}} SAT re-centering initiative {{as an attempt}} to stave off international embarrassment in regards to continuously declining test scores, even among top students.
