500|$|Meanwhile, the Duke of Edinburgh became heir {{presumptive}} to his childless paternal uncle, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, upon the Prince of Wales's renunciation of his {{rights to the}} duchy. Consequently, the family relocated to Coburg in 1889. Marie later came to view this moment as [...] "truly {{the end of a}} life that had been absolute happiness and joy without clouds, of a life with no disappointments or delusions and without any discordant note." [...] The Duchess, who was pro-German, hired a German governess for her daughters, bought them plain clothing and even had them confirmed in the Lutheran faith. The family spent their summers at Rosenau Castle. Duke Ernest was described by Marie as [...] "having his oddities"; his court was less strict than other German courts of the time. In Coburg, the princesses' education was broadened: more emphasis was placed on painting and music, which were taught by Anna Messing and Mrs. Helferich, respectively. On Thursdays and Sundays, Marie and her sisters went to the Coburg Theatre, an experience which they enjoyed greatly. Marie and Victoria Melita often observed their brother's friends and made comments on whom they liked better, an aspect which Marie believed was inevitable in the lives of girls who have brothers. Another activity which the girls enjoyed at Coburg was attending winter parties organised by their mother, during which they would <b>ice-skate</b> and play different games, such as ice hockey.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ice-skating</b> {{was also}} a popular choice of {{activity}} throughout the years. The <b>ice-skating</b> rink was constructed in January each year. A small snowplow would form a circle with tall snowbanks around the edge and park staff would use a fire hose to fill the pad with several inches of water. The process would take 24 hours until the ice finally froze. During the mid-1960s, the city built a plumbed outdoor <b>ice-skating</b> rink next to the clubhouse facility.
