5|$|Jughead regroups {{with his}} {{remaining}} friends. Some {{members of the}} group decide to split up in hopes the Predator will continue to pursue Veronica, allowing them to escape. Dilton Doily, Archie, Betty, and Jughead stay behind with Veronica. When the Predator attacks again, it kills Dilton and Jughead and critically wounds Archie. Betty and Veronica take refuge at Lodge Manor, where they hook Archie to an experimental healing machine. Archie is killed and Veronica is knocked unconscious when the Predator breaks their barricade. During a struggle, Betty's left hand is cut off, causing the Predator to show regret since it was motivated by a crush on Betty. She uses the opportunity to wound the Predator. Veronica awakens to find Betty using the <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> reconstruction system on the healing machine to transform the wounded Predator into Archie.|$|E
40|$|Human neuroimaging {{studies suggest}} that areas in {{temporal}} cortex respond preferentially to certain biologically relevant stimulus categories such as <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies.</b> Single-cell studies in monkeys have reported cells in inferior temporal cortex that respond selectively to <b>faces,</b> hands, <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> but provide little evidence of large clusters of category-specific cells that would form “areas. ” We probed the category selectivity of macaque temporal cortex for representations of monkey <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> monkey <b>body</b> parts relative to man-made objects using functional MRI in animals trained to fixate. Two face-selective areas were activated bilaterally in the posterior and anterior superior temporal sulcus exhibiting different degrees of category selectivity. The posterior face area was more extensively activated in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere. Immediately adjacent to the face areas, regions were activated bilaterally responding preferentially to body parts. Our findings suggest a category-selective organization for <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> parts in macaque temporal cortex...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the work of Francis Bacon {{in the context of}} his {{declared}} aim of giving a “visual shock. ” We explore what this means in terms of brain activity and what insights into the brain’s visual perceptive system his work gives. We do so especially with reference to the representation of <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> in the human visual brain. We discuss the evidence that shows that both these categories of stimuli have a very privileged status in visual perception, compared to the perception of other stimuli, including man-made artifacts such as houses, chairs, and cars. We show that viewing stimuli that depart significantly from a normal representation of <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> entails {{a significant difference in the}} pattern of brain activation. We argue that Bacon succeeded in delivering his “visual shock ” because he subverted the normal neural representation of <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies,</b> without at the same time subverting the representation of man-made artifacts...|$|R
5|$|When cats become aggressive, {{they try}} to make {{themselves}} appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting. Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.|$|E
5|$|Although to many she is {{best known}} for Demi's Birthday Suit, art aficionados {{consider}} her most famous work Disappearing Model. The work appeared on Ripley's Believe it or Not!. In the trompe l'oeil body painting, the <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> of the model are almost indistinguishable from the red and blue and yellow flowers of the wallpaper in the background. Her first body paintings was also memorable as she painted a moko on a female Ford Modeling Agency fashion model named Jana, which is a tabooed employment of a traditionally male ritual face mask. An example from Gair's website of her ability to trick the eye into seeing a three-dimensional subject blend with a two-dimensional background is seen in a photograph of a pregnant Elle Macpherson. Other examples of this technique include the cover of her first book (pictured below) and images from within this book.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 2014 at Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome, Devitt's fourteen-month {{reign as}} the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion {{came to an}} end, when he lost the title to Kota Ibushi in his fifth defense. Devitt {{wrestled}} the entire match in a full <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> paint, which he continued using for his bigger matches {{for the rest of}} his NJPW run. The following day, Devitt was attacked by the returning Ryusuke Taguchi, who had been sidelined with an injury for the past seven months, re-igniting the rivalry between the two former partners. On 6 April at Invasion Attack 2014, one year after the break-up of Apollo 55, Devitt faced Taguchi in a singles grudge match. During the match, Devitt repeatedly told The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson), the two newest members of Bullet Club, not to interfere in the match, which eventually led to them turning on him. In the end, Taguchi defeated Devitt, after which the two men shook hands, ending their rivalry with each other. The following day, New Japan announced Devitt's resignation from the promotion.|$|E

40|$|Prosopagnosia is {{a deficit}} in face {{recognition}} {{in the presence of}} relatively normal object recognition. Together with older lesion studies, recent brain-imaging results provide evidence for the closely related representations of <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> objects and, more recently, for brain areas sensitive to <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies.</b> This evidence raises the issue of whether developmental prosopagnosics may also have an impairment in encoding bodies. We investigated the first stages of <b>face,</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> object perception in four developmental prosopagnosics by comparing event-related potentials to canonically and upside-down presented stimuli. Normal configural encoding was absent in three of four developmental prosopagnosics for faces at the P 1 <b>and</b> for both <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> at the N 170 component. Our results demonstrate that prosopagnosics do not have this normal processing routine readily available for faces or bodies. A profound face recognition deficit characteristic of developmental prosopagnosia may not necessarily originate in a category-specific face recognition deficit in the initial stages of development. It may also have its roots in anomalous processing of the configuration, a visual routine that is important for other stimuli besides <b>faces.</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> trigger configuration-based visual strategies that are crucial in initial stages of stimulus encoding but also serve to bootstrap the acquisition of more feature-based visual skills that progressively build up in the course of development...|$|R

40|$|In {{the natural}} world, faces are not {{isolated}} objects but are rather {{encountered in the}} context of the whole body. Previous work has studied the perception of combined <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> using behavioural <b>and</b> electrophysiological measurements, but the neural correlates of emotional face-body perception still remain unexplored. Here, we combined happy <b>and</b> fearful <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> to investigate the influence of body expressions on the neural processing of the face, the effect of emotional ambiguity between the two and the role of the amygdala in this process. Our fMRI analyses showed that the activity in motor, prefrontal and visual areas increases when facial expressions are presented together with bodies rather than in isolation, consistent with the notion that seeing body expressions triggers both emotional and action-related processes. In contrast, PPI analyses revealed that amygdala modulatory activity increases after the presentation of isolated faces when compared to combined <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies.</b> Furthermore, a facial expression combined with a congruent body enhanced both cortical activity and amygdala functional connectivity when compared to an incongruent face-body compound. Finally, the results showed that emotional body postures influence the processing of facial expressions, especially when the emotion conveyed by the body implies danger...|$|R
40|$|<b>Faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> {{are more}} {{difficult}} to perceive when presented inverted than when presented upright (i. e., stimulus inversion effect), an effect that has been attributed to the disruption of holistic processing. The features that can trigger holistic processing in <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies,</b> however, still remain elusive. In this study, using a sequential matching task, we tested whether stimulus inversion affects various categories of visual stimuli: faces, faceless heads, faceless heads in body context, headless bodies naked, whole bodies naked, headless <b>bodies</b> clothed, <b>and</b> whole <b>bodies</b> clothed. Both accuracy and inversion efficiency score results show inversion effects for all categories but for clothed <b>bodies</b> (with <b>and</b> without heads). In addition, the magnitude of the inversion effect for <b>face,</b> naked <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> faceless heads was similar. Our findings demonstrate that the perception of <b>faces,</b> faceless heads, <b>and</b> naked <b>bodies</b> relies on holistic processing. Clothed <b>bodies</b> (with <b>and</b> without heads), on the other side, may trigger clothes-sensitive rather than bodysensitive perceptual mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Many people {{experience}} transient difficulties in recognizing faces {{but only a}} small number of them cannot recognize their family members when meeting them unexpectedly. Such face blindness is associated with serious problems in everyday life. A better understanding of the neuro-functional basis of impaired face recognition may be achieved by a careful comparison with an equally unique object category and by a adding a more realistic setting involving neutral faces as well facial expressions. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neuro-functional basis of perceiving <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> in three developmental prosopagnosics (DP) and matched healthy controls. Our approach involved materials consisting of neutral <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> as well as <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> expressing fear or happiness. The first main result is that the presence of emotional information has a different effect in the patient vs. the control group in the fusiform face area (FFA). Neutral faces trigger lower activation in the DP group, compared to the control group, while activation for facial expressions is the same in both groups. The second main result is that compared to controls, DPs have increased activation for bodies in the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) <b>and</b> for neutral <b>faces</b> in the extrastriate body area (EBA), indicating that <b>body</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> sensitive processes are less categorically segregated in DP.
