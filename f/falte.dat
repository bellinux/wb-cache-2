5000|$|Carne De Melocotón is {{the third}} studio album by Spanish duo Azúcar Moreno, their debut for the CBS-Epic label. The album, whose title {{translates}} as Peach Flesh, was released in 1988 and saw the Salazár sisters embracing influences from contemporary pop, rock and dance music and arrangements with prominent use of synthesizers and drum machines, combined with a new bolder and sexier image. The lead single was [...] "Aunque Me <b>Falte</b> El Aire" [...] which also was their debut single on the UK market, then released under the title [...] "Breathless". It was however a house music remix of the follow-up [...] "Debajo Del Olivo" [...] ("Under The Olive Tree") which became their breakthrough in Spain, and the track also became an underground club hit in Continental Europe and Scandinavia in early 1989. A full-length remix album entitled Mix In Spain followed that same year. The original album version of [...] "Debajo Del Olivo" [...] was included on the duo's first greatest hits album Mucho Azúcar - Grandes Éxitos, released in 1997.|$|E
5000|$|Following the duo's {{international}} {{breakthrough in}} 1990 with the Eurovision Song Contest entry [...] "Bandido" [...] and the album {{with the same}} title they released their second remix collection including the 12" [...] versions of the singles [...] "A Caballo", [...] "Bandido", [...] "Oye Como Va" [...] / [...] "Guajira" [...] and [...] "Ven Devórame Otra Vez". Just like the preceding Mix In Spain the album juxtaposed the Salazár sisters' typical flamenco vocal style against contemporary dance arrangements which drew heavily on influences from genres like house music, acid house, hip hop, R&B and rap. The Puerto Rico Mix of [...] "Oye Como Va" [...] / [...] "Guajira" [...] was the duo's first collaboration with acknowledged American remix producer Pablo Flores, {{best known for his}} work with Gloria Estefan. Flores would go on to remix several of Azúcar Moreno's hits later in the 1990s and 2000s. The Sugar Mix Album also featured two mixes previously included on the Mix In Spain album; [...] "Debajo Del Olivo" [...] (Mix In Spain) and [...] "Aunque Me <b>Falte</b> El Aire" [...] (Lerele Mix), both originally from their third studio album Carne De Melocotón.|$|E
5000|$|Consisting of sisters Antonia [...] "Toñi" [...] (14 March 1963) and Encarnación [...] "Encarna" [...] Salazar (10 January 1961), {{the singing}} duo comes from Badajoz. They {{are part of}} a large family of performers: their {{grandfather}} was a musician, their father a singer and songwriter, their brothers the members of band Los Chunguitos and their uncle is famous singer Porrina de Badajoz. The Azúcar Moreno sisters began their singing careers as back-up vocalists to their brothers, but in 1982, they were discovered and signed by record label EMI Spain, resulting in two albums with moderate commercial success released in 1984 and 1986. In 1988 they signed with CBS-Epic and relaunched their music with a bolder production style and matching sexier image and released the album Carne De Melocotón. They {{became one of the first}} Spanish acts to combine their Romani heritage and traditional cantaora vocal style with urban dance rhythms like disco, rhythm and blues, funk and techno. One of their first hit singles was a house music remix of the track [...] "Aunque Me <b>Falte</b> El Aire", released in 1988. A full-length remix album Mix In Spain was released in 1989 and the follow-up single [...] "Debajo Del Olivo" [...] also became a minor club hit in Continental Europe.|$|E

40|$|Em duas experiências de adubação da batatinha (Solanum tuberosum L.), uma em vasos e outra no campo, comparou-se, na presença de PK, o emprêgo da dose total de nitrogênio na ocasião do plantio, {{conforme}} o método tradicionalmente usado no Estado de São Paulo, com aplicações em cobertura ou parceladas. Os resultados confirmaram os de experiências anteriores e indicaram que os adubos nitrogenados devem ser empregados cedo, mas de maneira que as plantas não sejam prejudicadas, na sua fase inicial, pelo excesso de concentração local. A aplicação de parte da dose em cobertura contribui para diminuir essa concentração, mas deve ser efetuada de modo que não <b>falte</b> nitrogênio durante o período de vegetação ativa. In {{this paper}} are reported pot and field experiments with potatoes, comparing the application, {{in the presence}} of PK, of the total dose of nitrogen (urea) at planting time with treatments in which that dose was top-dressed or parceled out and added part at planting time and part afterwards. The results confirmed those of previously reported trials, indicating that large portion of the whole nitrogen requirement should be added at planting time, but in. such way as to avoid excessive concentration in the soil contacting the seed pieces. Top-dressing part of the total dose contributes to reduce that concentration; this application, however, should be made early enough to avoid nitrogen hunger during the period of active growing...|$|E

40|$|From combating to {{supporting}} pop music. The paradox of municipal {{music education in}} Sweden 1940 to 2000 Lindberg, BoelSchool of HumanitiesVäxjö universityVäxjö, SwedenOlofsson, GunnarSchool of Social SciencesVäxjö universityVäxjö, SwedenKeywordsHagstrom's music, combating popular music, Private music education, public music education, hegemonic cultural adaptationIn 1997 Sweden was the third biggest exporter of popular music in the world. This astonishing fact has often been explained as being {{the result of the}} large investments in municipal music schools that took place in Sweden from 1940. The explanation holds an interesting paradox. Most municipal music schools began with the aim to teach young people appreciate more valuable music (i. e. classical) than the popular music of the entertainment industry. Around 1940 there was a large debate on the "Dance-floor-misery". Christians and conservatives attacked the public amusements available in abundance, arguing that they led to moral shallowness among the youth. It was especially young people's contact with dance and popular music offered in open-air dance-floors and dance-pavilions that caused most harm. The debate began in 1938 with an official letter to the Government from the bishop of Växjö. It led to the forming of a Royal committee assigned to find ways to decontaminate the unsatisfactory state of the entertainment industry. In Växjö the Church and the municipality joined forces forming a Youth Council. Its main achievement was to start a music school in 1947. During the 1970 s it {{became one of the most}} successful in Sweden, thanks to its tolerant views on modern genres and instruments used in popular music. By 1980 it had driven a once prosperous music school run by the town's largest music shop out of business. This school ? Hagstrom's music school ? had started in 1944. Its main aim was to meet the demand for education on instruments like accordion, guitar, saxophone, keyboard and drums, instruments used in popular dance-music. The Växjö case elucidates the process that led the once detested popular music to become accepted and fully incorporated into the curricula of the municipal music schools. This process will be linked to the thesis that a hegemonic culture has somehow to adopt prevailing views and tastes among the dominated in order to survive (cf. Gramsci, Williams).
