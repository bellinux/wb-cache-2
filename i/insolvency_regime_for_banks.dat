40|$|This {{contribution}} {{develops a}} blueprint for a European fiscal union. The proposal addresses the shortcomings of most other reform designs which do not offer a solution for insolvent or noncooperative euro countries. We suggest a design which combines fiscal insurance with an orderly procedure to restructure the debt of an insolvent euro member. We show that fiscal insurance and a sovereign insolvency procedure are no contradiction but, on the contrary, mutually enforcing: An effective fiscal insurance helps to limit the stability risks involved {{in the implementation of}} an <b>insolvency</b> <b>regime</b> <b>for</b> sovereigns. And vice versa, a well-defined insolvency procedure reduces the danger that a fiscal capacity motivated as an insurance against transitory asymmetric shocks degenerates into a permanent transfer system. Moreover, we show that both elements are a helpful complement for the functioning of the European banking union and the new European fiscal governance. ...|$|R
40|$|The International Monetary Fund (IMF) {{stated in}} spring {{of this year}} that a more timely {{restructuring}} of Greece's sovereign debt would have been beneficial. But what are the available options for early debt restructuring? The report argues that current reforms in the Euro area, in particular, introducing collective action clauses, {{are unlikely to be}} sufficient in their present form. Alternatively, a statutory solution {{in the form of an}} international or European <b>insolvency</b> <b>regime</b> <b>for</b> sovereign states is difficult to implement politically. Therefore, the contractual approach to debt restructuring should be facilitated by redesigning future contracts for bonds in the euro area. Specifically, more powerful collective action clauses should be included in bond contracts and the ratable payment provision of all creditors should be reformed in order to limit the impact of legal disputes in the event of a debt restructuring. This approach would simplify future debt restructuring operations and make the no-bailout rule more credible, thus re-activating the disciplinary effect of interest rates on governments...|$|R

50|$|Banks need to {{evaluate}} the risk of adverse events other than credit risks and market risks. These risks, called operational risks, include the major events most likely to cause bank failure, such as massive internal fraud. The international compliance <b>regime</b> <b>for</b> <b>banks,</b> Basel II, requires that such risks be quantified using a mixture of statistical theory, such as extreme value theory, and scenario analysis conducted by internal committees of experts. A bank regulator (such as the Federal Reserve in the United States) oversees the result.

The RBNZ points to retail depositors as essential market participants with the potential to exert market discipline on banks, but there are differing opinions as to their effectiveness in this role. This paper provides background comments and develops, in the New Zealand context, arguments in support of the Llewellyn & Mayes (2003) prerequisites for the exertion of effective market discipline by stakeholder monitors. We conduct empirical tests relative to some of the Llewellyn & Mayes (2003) prerequisites but find little evidence to support the proposition that they are being met among New Zealand retail depositors. ...|$|R

In particular we comment and discuss the -ACME study on non-life long tail liabilities; reserve risk and risk margin assessment under Solvency II". In the latter study the reserve risk calculation of non-life long tail insurers is investigated, based on a sample of 45 supervised European insurance companies. We start by giving an overview of risk measures used in a solvency environment. Next, we show that the Value-at-Risk measure is the solution of a general optimization problem. In a way this supports the current regulatory <b>regime</b> <b>for</b> <b>banking</b> supervision established by the Basel Capital Accord and the Solvency II regulatory regime under construction. Indeed, both have put forward a Value-at-Risk-based capital requirement approach.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the emerging}} international supervisory <b>regime</b> <b>for</b> <b>banking</b> institutions that {{operate on a}} transnational basis. It focuses on the basle framework as an institutional regime of norms and principles that govern international financial relations amongst the g 10 countries. This paper argues that the basle committee on banking supervision has {{played a significant role}} in developing principles of sound regulatory practice for national supervisors to adopt in their jurisdictions. The increasing deregulation and liberalisation of international financial markets necessitates effective international minimum standards of supervisory practice to regulate the international activities of banking institutions. This paper further suggests that the increasing complexity of international financial markets and the need to reduce systemic risk require a global supervisor to coordinate the regulatory activities of national authorities. Indeed, a global supervisor should take the lead in providing information and expertise for national authorities and should, in some cases, take more proactive measures to ensure compliance with international norms...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{possible and}} proposed {{responses to the}} “To Big (complex, interconnected, important) To Fail (TBTF) Problem”. It argues that the corporate governance of large shareholderowned deposit taking banks is particularly problematic because of the implicit insurance their shareholders and bondholders enjoy, at the taxpayers expense. This creates issues of moral hazard and also competitive inequality, because TBTF banks can raise funds more cheaply than non-TBTF banks. The US pre-funded deposit insurance scheme with risk-related premia does {{a pretty good job}} managing the moral hazard issues relating to non-TBTF banks. A parallel mechanism involving a special resolution <b>regime</b> <b>for</b> TBTF <b>banks</b> and the equivalent of deposit insurance with risk-related premia needs to be put in place. Whether the scheme should be pre-funded or operated on a ex post „polluter pays‟ basis, and the associated tax <b>regime</b> <b>for</b> TBTF <b>banks</b> needs further consideration. Bondholders should not enjoy the current level of protection and „Co-Co‟ bonds may be part of the solution. Consumer Protection is a good idea and deposit taking banks should be regulated as other „utilities‟ are in the UK. The corporate governance problem would be simpler if all retail deposit taking banks were mutual...|$|R

40|$|One {{specific}} {{aspect of}} financial safety nets {{that has been}} in the spotlight of late is deposit insurance. As events in markets are still unfolding, {{it is too soon to}} draw definitive conclusions regarding the effects of the crisis and the adequacy of financial safety nets, including deposit insurance arrangements. Nonetheless, preliminary suggestions for policy are emerging and the article singles out four areas for special attention. First, as regards coverage, deposit insurance systems with low levels of coverage and/or partial insurance may not be effective in preventing <b>bank</b> runs. Second, <b>for</b> an explicit deposit insurance system to be effective, depositors need to understand the extent of and limits to existing deposit protection schemes. Third, when different institutions are entrusted with responsibilities that are relevant in a crisis situation, ex ante arrangements delimiting the scope of the different responsibilities as well as the respective powers may not be sufficient to ensure co-ordination that is as close and smooth as needed. Fourth, the question as to whether a specific bankruptcy <b>regime</b> <b>for</b> <b>banks</b> is needed remains an important issue. ...|$|R
40|$|Bank <b>insolvency</b> <b>regimes</b> vary widely. First, many {{countries}} maintain separate bank insolvency rules {{from those that}} govern insolvency of other firms or individuals.

40|$|The present {{crisis has}} {{revealed}} that, as expected, {{much of the}} safety net for handling failures in the banking system is deficient, particularly <b>for</b> cross-border <b>banks,</b> and the present problems had to be handled by a range of ad hoc measures. The principal new measure {{that needs to be}} undertaken in most countries is the implementation of a satisfactory special resolution <b>regime</b> <b>for</b> <b>banks.</b> This paper, however, deals with two further steps that could assist the operation of the safety net. The first is to ensure earlier intervention so there is more time to put a satisfactory rescue or resolution in place. The second is to implement a regime of prompt corrective action (structured early intervention and resolution, SEIR) so that both supervisors and banks know that a regime of increasing intensity will take place according to a strict timetable that will end in the authorities stepping into the bank while it still has positive capital, if the earlier stages are not effective. The paper evaluates the means of doing this in a European environment making use of the experience in the United States. It concludes that, while a lot can be done even within the current framework of national supervision, particularly through pre-positioning, cross-border banks can be better treated either by revising the home-host responsibilities or by moving to a supranational level of responsibility for SEIR <b>for</b> those <b>banks</b> whose continued operation is considered necessary for financial stability in any member state. early intervention; prompt corrective action; cross-border banks; pre-positioning; bank resolution...|$|R

40|$|Europe is {{struggling}} with {{the resolution of the}} severe debt crisis and {{is in the process of}} overhauling its institutional set up. One element of the reform agenda is the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which is intended to provide liquidity assistance to countries in case financial stability in the Euro Area is at stake.

In this contribution, it is argued that establishing an explicit crisis resolution mechanism is in principle useful. However, the ESM is defined too broadly, and its scope should be limited to the provision of emergency liquidity assistance only under narrowly defined circumstances.

40|$|The General Agreement on Trade in Services (known as the GATS) is an {{important}} new element in the international framework that affects the regulation of every WTO Member's financial sector. However, except for {{a limited number of}} country-specific case studies, no attempt has been made to compare WTO commitments to open the domestic banking sector to foreign banks with actual regulatory practice in a systematic and comprehensive manner on a cross-country basis. Nor has much attention been devoted to systematically and comprehensively assess the degree to which WTO Members discriminate against foreign bank. This paper draws upon a new and comprehensive dataset consisting of the commitments countries made at the WTO and the regulations actually imposed on foreign banks by those countries. The dataset covers 123 WTO Members for whom there was also information available on their current regulatory <b>regime</b> <b>for</b> <b>banking</b> (based on the responses to a World Bank survey as discussed in Barth, Caprio, and Levine (2006)). On the basis of that data, the authors develop indices measuring the degree of openness to foreign banking based upon both commitments made and actual regulatory practice, with a view to assessing the overall extent to which countries open their borders to foreign banks more than they are legally obliged to do based upon their WTO commitments. The dataset is also used to assess the overall extent to which countries discriminate against foreign banks by regulating them less favorably than domestic banks. Although our results are still quite preliminary, they do show substantial divergences between commitments and practices. Indices of market openness and discrimination reveal wide differences among the 123 countries in the sample.
