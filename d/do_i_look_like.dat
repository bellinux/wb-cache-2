One senior Nationalist Party official, Chen Lifu, later complained that the intelligence agencies knew of Ji's communist connections but that Finance Minister H.H. Kung trusted Ji because they were from the same province and Kung respected Ji's father. The next Finance Minister, T. V. Soong, Chen continued, was American trained and could not speak Chinese well. Soong and Ji got along because they both had a better command of English than Chinese, Chen charged, and that Ji fed damaging policies to both Kung and Soong, but Chiang Kai-shek trusted and defended them because they were married to his wife's sisters. Ji Chaozhu, Ji's brother, recalled that Kung had once demanded" [...] "Chaoding, tell the truth. Are you a Communist?"

Douglas won a Golden Globe award, although Minnelli said Douglas should have won an Oscar: [...] "He achieved a moving and memorable portrait of the artist—a man of massive creative power, triggered by severe emotional stress, the fear and horror of madness."

500|$|Wilkinson's {{arrival in}} the House of Commons {{attracted}} considerable press comment, much of it related to her bright red hair and the vivid colours of her clothing. She informed MPs: [...] "I happen to represent in this House one of the heaviest iron and steel producing areas in the world—I know <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>look</b> <b>like</b> it, but <b>I</b> do". The Woman's Leader [...] described her as a [...] "vigorous, uncompromising feminist and an exceedingly tenacious, forcible and hard-headed politician". As an unofficial spokesperson for women's rights, Wilkinson achieved {{one of her first}} parliamentary victories in 1925, when she persuaded the government to correct anomalies affecting widows in its Pensions Bill. She combined with Lady Astor from the Conservative benches, in March 1926, to attack the government's proposed decrease in expenditure on women's training centres. Wilkinson's ODNB biographer, Brian Harrison, acknowledges that while [...] "women's issues" [...] were often to the fore in her speeches, she was primarily a socialist rather than a feminist, and if forced to decide between them would have chosen the former.|$|R

40|$|This thesis weaves {{together}} personal {{narrative and}} scholarly analysis of autobiography and pain. Judith Butler’s book entitled, Gender Trouble {{was used to}} look at and try to understand the performative body and in the analysis of autobiography within artwork. While Butler restricts her argument to hetronormativity, I have expanded upon that to consider the role of performativity and authority within autobiography and photography. One of the important tensions within my imagery is the question of truth. Is the body you are viewing truly in pain or <b>do</b> <b>I</b> simply <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> am performing pain. When, if ever, is something authentic? And if the world is based solely on perception, then how do we all co-exist? Elaine Scarry tackles this problem of conveying pain in her book, The Body In Pain: Making and Un-making Culture. Scarry believes pain to be a shared cultural phenomenon, but critiques the way it is shared by saying that “having pain is to have certainty and hearing about pain is to have doubt. ” In my experience, embracing pain, or even just acknowledging its existence is an exercise in deep empathy. This non-judgemental emapthy or cognitive knowledge building of another situation is difficult and it is rare and undervalued as a social skill. Scarry goes on to talk about the importance of objects to this world of empathy. “Because each person’s made objects now inhabit the shareable external space outside her own body accessible to all, the objects she makes can be coupled with those objects made by the second, and the third, and so the large imagined town gets made. ” I see myself adding to the work that came before me, adding to the imagined town. I see the need for a public discourse and identity based on expressed emotion. If empathy were more prevelant in our society, imagine the difference it could make. Imagine the town. “Through tools and acts of making human beings become implicated in each others sentience. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Cancer {{patients}} often {{experience a}} large number of symptoms together. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the symptom clusters in cancer patients at palliative care clinic. Methods: Hundred and seventy consecutive patients were enrolled in the study. Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale was used for symptom assessment of the patients. Results: The most experienced symptoms by the patients during the past week before hospitalization in palliative care clinic were lack of energy (95. 4 %), weight loss (91. 2 %), lack of appetite (89. 4 %), pain (88. 2 %), dry mouth (87. 6 %), feeling sad (87. 6 %), feeling nervous (82. 9 %), worrying (81. 2 %), and feeling irritable (80. 6 %). Five symptom clusters were defined. First cluster: pain, feeling nervous, dry mouth, worrying, feeling irritable, weight loss; second cluster: feeling drowsy, numbness/tingling in hands/feet, difficulty in sleeping, dizziness, constipation, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>look</b> <b>like</b> myself; third cluster: nausea, vomiting; fourth cluster: shortness of breath, difficulty in swallowing, cough, change in the way food tastes; and fifth cluster: feeling bloated, problems with urination, diarrhea, itching, mouth sores, hair loss, swelling of arm or legs, change in the skin. Conclusions: We encountered various symptom clusters in advanced cancer patients. Identification of symptom clusters and knowledge of cluster composition in oncological population may particularly contribute individualization of the treatment...|$|R

40|$|In July 2010 Facebook {{had more}} than 400 million active users. 400 million people who on average have 130 digital friends, who create 70 pieces of content each month, and of whom 100 million even access Facebook through their mobile devices. 1 These people share their photos, keep their friends posted on their whereabouts, {{subscribe}} to user groups and visit the pages of old school mates. Since its foundation in 2004, Facebook experienced explosive growth and new applications, such as games, mobile features, a gift shop and Facebook Ads were added almost monthly, making it the most important social network site on the web. When asked about their reasons for using Facebook, users mention qualities such as being given a platform to present themselves; to maintain connections with others; to meet new people; to articulate their social networks, or to engage in romantic or professional relationships (Cf. Ellison, Steinfield, Lampe 2007 : 1). On the other hand, Wikipedia offers anyone knowing how to start up a web browser to easily find as much as fifteen different methods – some of them described in their every detail – for committing suicide. On ‘suicide-blogs’ depressed youngsters share stories, overtly discuss their plans, and ask advice on what pills to use in order to die the quickest. 2 Although at first glance these sites might seem effective ways to offer help and mutual understanding in times of crisis, the result is frequently countereffective, handing morbid suggestions to already insecure kids and helping them cross the ultimate line. To shockingly quote a 16 -year old girl on zelfmoord. nl: “Every day we talk through msn and fantasize {{about what it would}} be like in Heaven. Two weeks ago we started collecting pills. By now I get them from almost anywhere. From my parents’ medical aid kit or from friends. Soon I will have a lethal mix. Then, finally, I shall find peace. ” These are all matters of identity.
