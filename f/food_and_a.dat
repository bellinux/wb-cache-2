5|$|The Pandavas {{live under}} the guise of sadhus in a remote town. Bakasura is a very {{powerful}} monster who plagues the town. He blackmails them to send two oxen, a cartload of <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> human being everyday to quench his hunger. It so happens that, the house owners of the Pandavas get their turn to send the human being on that day. However, Kunti says that she would rather sacrifice her own son instead of their only one, since she has five children.|$|E
5|$|The rivers {{played a}} leading role in the {{lifestyle}} of the Aboriginal people, acting as a source of <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> means of communication and trade. Murray cod and shellfish were gathered for food and bark canoes were used for travel along the rivers. Scars on many trees alongside the rivers are evidence of this extensive use of canoes. In the summer it is likely that the Bangerang and Wiradjuri joined the Monaro groups in the Bogong moth feasts in the alpine country to the east.|$|E
5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder (CCD) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that occurs when}} the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear and leave behind a queen, plenty of <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> few nurse bees {{to care for the}} remaining immature bees and the queen. While such disappearances have occurred throughout the history of apiculture, and were known by various names (disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease), the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006 in conjunction with a drastic {{rise in the number of}} disappearances of western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America. European beekeepers observed similar phenomena in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, Switzerland and Germany, albeit to a lesser degree, and the Northern Ireland Assembly received reports of a decline greater than 50%.|$|E

5|$|Crocodilian {{teeth are}} adapted for seizing and holding prey, and food is {{swallowed}} unchewed. The digestive tract is relatively short, as meat {{is a fairly}} simple substance to digest. The stomach {{is divided into two}} parts: a muscular gizzard that grinds <b>food,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> digestive chamber where enzymes work on it. The stomach is more acidic than that of any other vertebrate and contains ridges for gastroliths, which {{play a role in the}} mechanical breakdown of food. Digestion takes place more quickly at higher temperatures. Crocodilians have a very low metabolic rate and consequently, low energy requirements. This allows them to survive for many months on a single large meal, digesting the food slowly. They can withstand extended fasting, living on stored fat between meals. Even recently hatched crocodiles are able to survive 58 days without food, losing 23% of their bodyweight during this time. An adult crocodile needs between a tenth and a fifth of the amount of food necessary for a lion of the same weight, and can live for half a year without eating.|$|E
5|$|The king's reign {{was marked}} by a drought lasting seven years that caused a famine in much of Imerina. According to oral history, the king {{attempted}} to purchase rice from his fief at Ambohipiainana. The town had a surplus but the local leader refused to sell rice to Andriamasinavalona, claiming none was available. The king then sent porters to purchase rice from Antsahatovoka, where the residents declared that while the land was his and it was thus unnecessary for the king to purchase what already belonged to him, there was no rice available to share. Finally Andriamasinavalona sought to purchase rice in Andraisisa. His money was refused by the local leader, Andriandrivotra, who willingly gave the king large shares of <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> tribute of silver. To reward {{the leader of the}} fief, Andriamasinavalona promised to give him anything he liked. Andriandrivotra declared that all he desired was the love of his sovereign. To show his appreciation, Andriamasinavalona declared that he would make Andriasisa into a great fief, and gave Andriandrivotra a large piece of land {{to the west of the}} territory. He then undertook a major expansion of the Betsimitatatra rice fields around Antananarivo, significantly increasing their rice production to feed the populace.|$|E

25|$|The {{mangrove}} monitor is hunted in {{many places}} for its skin, which is used for leather in making drum heads. Although international trade in this species is small, Mertens {{referred to it as}} one of the most heavily exploited monitor lizards. In 1980, trade in over 13,000 monitors was declared. However, in many remote places, they are used as a food source and are killed because of their reputation for preying on domestic animals. An ethnic group on Guam eats the monitors as a traditional <b>food,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> business there sells monitors for food.|$|E

25|$|Pasta was {{originally}} solely {{a part of}} Italian and European cuisine owing to its popularity there. With an increase in popularity on a worldwide scale, pasta has crossed international borders {{and is now a}} popular form of fast <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> staple in North America and elsewhere. This is due to the great amount of Italian immigration into Canada and the United States around the beginning of the 20th century.

25|$|Food {{security}} – Food security {{requires that}} all people at all times have both physical and economic access to basic food.

In the past, food security problems have been dealt with at both national and global levels. However, their impacts are limited. According to UN, {{the key is to}} tackle the problems relating to access to assets, work and assured income (related to economic security).|$|E
