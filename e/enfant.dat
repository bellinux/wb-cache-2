5|$|Eventually, Madlax and Margaret {{meet and}} {{embark on a}} search for Quanzitta Marison, a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who {{supposedly}} knows about Margaret's book, Enfant's involvement with it, and <b>Enfant</b> itself. Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about <b>Enfant</b> and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Enfant's leader Friday Monday possesses supernatural powers connected to the three ancient books, one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he, in fact, died 12 years ago and held on to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret. Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to advance his own plans.|$|E

25|$|Lieutenant John Thicknesse {{replaced}} Williams. Shortly thereafter, on 16 October 1798 the French 14-gun privateer <b>Enfant</b> Prodigue captured Charlotte off Cap Français or Cape François, Hispaniola. Charlotte suffered one man wounded {{before she}} struck her colours. A second, smaller schooner and two large armed launches supported <b>Enfant</b> Prodigue {{in the attack}} on Charlotte, which suffered considerable damage. Her main boom topping lift and all the braces had been shot away. One gun had been dismounted and two others disabled by broken breeches, leaving her with only five guns to continue the action. Surrounded by the enemy and unable to manoeuvre, Thicknesse was forced to surrender. Charlottes low casualty rate was {{a consequence of the}} French tactic of firing high to disable rigging.

When a [...] "picture book", presumably given to Margaret by her late father, attracts the attention of international criminal network <b>Enfant,</b> she discovers that the origins of the book lie in Gazth-Sonika. Enfant's top operative, Carrossea Doon, tracks Margaret down but tips off his superiors in the wrong direction, towards Madlax, who has been causing <b>Enfant</b> trouble for some time. Meanwhile, Vanessa Rene, Margaret's former tutor whose parents died because of Gazth-Sonikan war, discovers that her current employer, Bookwald Industries, covertly supports the war by supplying both sides with firearms and starts investigating its true cause. Her investigation brings her to Gazth-Sonika, where Madlax is hired as her bodyguard, and together, they uncover data that proves that <b>Enfant</b> orchestrated the entire conflict. <b>Enfant</b> eventually intercepts them and they are forced into hiding. Back in Nafrece, Margaret decides to help Vanessa and travels to Gazth-Sonika, accompanied by her devoted and sometimes overprotective maid Elenore Baker and Carrossea Doon.|$|E
