40|$|Naoya MasumoriDepartment of Urology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, JapanAbstract: <b>Imidafenacin</b> is an antimuscarinic {{agent with}} high {{affinity}} for the M 3 and M 1 muscarinic receptor subtypes and low {{affinity for the}} M 2 subtype, and is used to treat overactive bladder. Several animal {{studies have demonstrated that}} <b>imidafenacin</b> has organ selectivity for the bladder over the salivary glands, colon, heart, and brain. In Phase I studies in humans, the approximately 2. 9 -hour elimination half-life of <b>imidafenacin</b> was shorter than that of other antimuscarinics such as tolterodine and solifenacin. <b>Imidafenacin</b> was approved for clinical use in overactive bladder in Japan in 2007 after a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study and a propiverine-controlled Phase III study conducted in Japanese patients demonstrated that <b>imidafenacin</b> 0. 1 mg twice daily was clinically effective for treating overactive bladder and was not inferior to propiverine for reduction of episodes of incontinence, with a better safety profile than propiverine. Several short-term clinical studies have demonstrated that <b>imidafenacin</b> also improves sleep disorders, nocturia, and nocturia-related quality of life. In addition, it is speculated that addon therapy with <b>imidafenacin</b> is beneficial for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia whose overactive bladder symptoms are not controlled by alpha- 1 adrenoceptor antagonists. No cognitive impairment or influence of <b>imidafenacin</b> on the QTc interval has been observed. Although there have been very few relevant long-term clinical studies, the available information suggests the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of <b>imidafenacin,</b> with less frequent severe adverse events, such as dry mouth and constipation. In addition, <b>imidafenacin</b> can be used safely for a long time even for cognitively vulnerable elderly patients with symptoms of overactive bladder. Thus, it is highly likely that <b>imidafenacin</b> is safe, efficacious, and tolerable to control symptoms of overactive bladder even over the long term. However, it remains unknown if the practical effectiveness of <b>imidafenacin</b> is applicable to ethnic groups other than Japanese.

40|$|The binding of orally {{administered}} <b>imidafenacin,</b> used {{to treat}} overactive bladders, to muscarinic receptors in rat tissue was characterized based on pharmacokinetics. The binding in six tissues including bladder tissue was measured using [N-methyl- 3 H] scopolamine methyl chloride ([3 H]NMS). Pharmacokinetic pa-rameters were estimated from measurements of the concen-tration of <b>imidafenacin</b> in serum, the bladder, and the submax-illary gland by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The receptor binding affinity of <b>imidafenacin</b> in vitro was significantly lower in the bladder than submaxillary gland or colon. The oral administration of <b>imidafenacin</b> (0. 79, 1. 57, and 6. 26 mol/kg) was characterized by a more selective and longer-lasting binding to muscarinic receptors in the blad-der than other tissues. <b>Imidafenacin</b> showed little binding to brain muscarinic receptors, consistent with its minor effect on the central nervous system. Pharmacokinetic data showed that orally administered <b>imidafenacin</b> was distributed at a higher concentration in the bladder than the serum or submaxillary gland of rats. After the intravesical instillation of <b>imidafenacin,</b> there was significant binding of muscarinic receptors in the bladder. Furthermore, a significant level of <b>imidafenacin</b> was detected in the urine of rats given a 1. 57 mol/kg concentration of this agent. The present study demonstrated that imidafena-cin administered orally distributes predominantly to the bladder and exerts more selective and longer-lasting effect on the blad-der than other tissues, such as the submaxillary gland, colon, and brain.

40|$|<b>Imidafenacin,</b> {{a potent}} M 1 and M 3 -subtype {{selective}} antagonist, is now used clinically in Japan {{for the treatment}} of overactive bladder (OAB). Pharmacological studies of this agent showed selectivity in the bladder over salivary gland and brain. The oral administration of <b>imidafenacin</b> at low doses caused a more selective and longer-lasting binding to muscarinic receptors in the bladder than at other tissues such as the salivary gland, heart, colon, lung and brain, suggesting preferential muscarinic receptor binding in the bladder. Pharmacokinetic data showed that the orally administered <b>imidafenacin</b> distributed at a higher concentration in the bladder compared to that in the serum or submaxillary gland of rats. Furthermore, a significant level of <b>imidafenacin</b> was detected in the urine of rats treated orally with this agent. The intravesical instillation of <b>imidafenacin</b> resulted in significant binding of bladder muscarinic receptors. In experiments using autoradiography (ARG) and positron emission tomography (PET), <b>imidafenacin</b> exerted little significant binding of muscarinic receptors in rat brain and no impairment of cognitive behavior in rats and monkeys. Clinical studies indicated a favorable efficacy-to-side effect ratio of <b>imidafenacin</b> in patients with OAB. Thus,imidafenacin when given orally exhibits predominant distribution to the bladder and possibly exerting a more selective and persistent pharmacological effect on the bladder than other tissues including the submaxillary gland, colon and brain. Such selectivity may be attributable to a direct blockade of bladder muscarinic receptors by the excreted urinary <b>imidafenacin.</b> Thus, <b>imidafenacin</b> may be efficacious in treating patients with an overactive bladder, with the improved tolerability beyond the currently available agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{crushing}} of tablets {{and opening}} of capsules {{should not be}} performed without proper care, as these actions may adversely affect the pharmaceutical release mechanisms. However, various clinical circumstances occasionally necessitate these actions. The long-term stability of the commercial formulation of <b>imidafenacin</b> was confirmed after crushing of tablets. For the safe administration of crushed <b>imidafenacin</b> tablets, we examined the pharmacokinetics of crushed <b>imidafenacin</b> 0. 1 -mg tablet after single oral administration in healthy men. Plasma concentrations were measured in 6 male volunteers (age, 33. 3 ± 10. 6 years) orally administered crushed <b>imidafenacin</b> under fasting conditions. <b>Imidafenacin</b> was rapidly absorbed and plasma concentrations peaked (Cmax) at 414 ± 108 pg/ml after 1. 5 h (Tmax; median), after which the drug was rapidly eliminated with a half-life (t 1 / 2) of 2. 8 ± 0. 3 h. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 0 - 10) was 1, 680 ± 334 pg･h/ml. There {{were no significant differences}} in Cmax, Tmax and t 1 / 2 between the crushed and tablet medications. Thus, crushing has almost no influence on the pharmacokinetics of <b>imidafenacin.</b> Consequently, this study was made available as information for patients requiring crushed anticholinergic agents...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: <b>Imidafenacin</b> (KRP- 197 /ONO- 8025) is {{the latest}} antimuscarinic (AM) {{developed}} {{for the treatment of}} overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) and, at the moment, it is marketed only in Japan. This compound has been developed to improve the tolerability of AM therapy by binding specifically the M 3 receptor subtype, thus limiting undesirable adverse events (AEs). Areas covered: This systematic review offers a brief explanation of the mechanism of action and of the pharmacokinetics of <b>imidafenacin</b> and helps readers to understand the clinical efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the compound in the setting of OAB therapy. Expert opinion: <b>Imidafenacin</b> is an AM drug with excellent efficacy, tolerability, and safety. It is indicated for patients with nocturia, nocturnal polyuria, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. This compound, due to its pharmacokinetic properties, gives the opportunity to be easily adjusted in its dosages. Further studies should assess the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of <b>imidafenacin</b> in Caucasian and African populations because this AM agent, at the moment, has been evaluated just in Asian populations. More studies should evaluate and compare efficacy, safety, and tolerability of <b>imidafenacin</b> also with other largely utilized AMs, such as oxybutynin, tolterodine, and fesoterodine, or with the other M 3 selective compound, darifenacin...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMuscarinic and purinergic (P 2 X) receptors play {{critical}} {{roles in}} bladder urothelium under physiological and pathological conditions. Aim of {{present study was}} to characterize these receptors in rat bladder urothelium and detrusor muscle using selective radioligands of [N-methyl- 3 H]scopolamine methyl chloride ([3 H]NMS) and αβ-methylene ATP [2, 8 - 3 H]tetrasodium salt ([3 H]αβ-MeATP). Similar binding parameters for each radioligand were observed in urothelium and detrusor muscle. Pretreatment with N-(2 -chloroethyl) - 4 -piperidinyl diphenylacetate (4 -DAMP mustard) mustard revealed co-existence of M 2 and M 3 receptors, with the number of M 2 receptors being larger in the urothelium and detrusor muscle. Intravesical administration of <b>imidafenacin</b> and Dpr-P- 4 (N → O) (active metabolite of propiverine) displayed significant binding of muscarinic receptors in the urothelium and detrusor muscle. The treatment with cyclophosphamide (CYP) or resiniferatoxin (RTX) resulted in a significant decrease in maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) for [3 H]NMS and/or [3 H]αβ-MeATP in the urothelium and detrusor muscle. These results demonstrated that 1) pharmacological characteristics of muscarinic and P 2 X receptors in rat bladder urothelium were similar to those in the detrusor muscle, 2) that densities of these receptors were significantly altered by pretreatments with CYP and RTX, and 3) that these receptors may be pharmacologically affected by <b>imidafenacin</b> and Dpr-P- 4 (N → O) which are excreted in the urine...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effect of antimuscarinic antagonists on carbachol-induced {{contraction}} of normal human bladder and detrusor overactivity associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (DO/BPH). Samples of human bladder muscle were obtained from patients undergoing total cystectomy for bladder cancer (normal bladder), and those undergoing retropubic prostatectomy for BPH. All of the patients with DO/BPH had detrusor overactivity according to urodynamic studies. Detrusor muscle strips were mounted in 10 -ml organ baths containing Krebs solution, and concentration–response curves for carbachol were obtained in the presence of antimuscarinic antagonists (4 -DAMP, methoctramine, pirenzepine, tolterodine, solifenacin, trospium, propiverine, oxybutynin, and <b>imidafenacin)</b> or vehicle. All antagonists competitively antagonized concentration–response curves to carbachol with high affinities in normal bladder. The rank order of mean pA 2 values was as follows: trospium (10. 1)  >  4 -DAMP (9. 87), <b>imidafenacin</b> (9. 3)  > solifenacin (8. 8)  > tolterodine (8. 6)  > oxybutynin (8. 3)  > propiverine (7. 7)  > pirenzepine (7. 4)  > methoctramine (6. 6). The effects of these antimuscarinic antagonists did not change when tested with DO/BPH bladder, suggesting that each antimuscarinic antagonist has a similar effect in this condition. Schild plots showed a slope corresponding to unity, except for propiverine with DO/BPH detrusor. In conclusion, M 3 -receptors mainly mediate contractions in human bladder strips with normal state and DO/BPH...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Antimuscarinics (AMs) are the {{mainstay}} of pharmacological treatment of overactive bladder (OAB), a symptom complex defined {{by the presence of}} urinary urgency, usually associated with frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence. The AMs used to treat OAB differ in their pharmacological profiles, which may affect their potential for causing adverse effects (AEs). Areas covered: The present article aims to review the literature about pharmacokinetics (PK) of the different AMs used in the treatment of OAB. Furthermore, the AEs related to the use of these drugs and their incidence are presented. This systematic review is based on material searched and obtained via Medline, Pubmed and EMBASE up to March 2012 using the search terms "adverse events, pharmacokinetics, tolerability" in combination with "darifenacin, fesoterodine, <b>imidafenacin,</b> oxybutynin, propiverine, solifenacin, tolterodine, and trospium. " Expert opinion: Antimuscarinics are the first-line pharmacological treatment for OAB. Despite the development of new molecules that improve their efficacy/safety profile, there are some drugs that are pharmacokinetically more appropriate to be prescribed in specific populations such as patients with neurological disease or the elderly. Moreover, research should be encouraged in evaluating antimuscarinics in conjunction with other drugs such as estrogens or beta-agonists. The identification of prognostic criteria for pharmacological therapy would be helpful...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{potential}} impact of antimuscarinics (AMs) on cardiac function {{is a major concern}} in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) patients, especially in older ones who are likely to present cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities and other risk factors that may predispose them to the adverse cardiac effects of this therapy. AREAS COVERED: This article aims to review the literature on the impact on the CV system of AMs used in the treatment of OAB, giving a comprehensive explanation of the pathogenetic mechanisms of AMs' effects on CV system and the impact of each AM drug on cardiac function. EXPERT OPINION: Although the CV safety of AM drugs seems to be good, evidence provided in this manuscript does not allow to exclude an increase in HR, QT prolongation or an increase in the CV risk due to drug-drug interactions in OAB patients who are usually elderly and have comorbidities. Clinical and electrocardiographic monitoring may be necessary throughout the administration period in selected populations such as patients aged > 80 years, those with coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure. Further studies are needed to understand whether the most recently developed AM drugs, such as <b>imidafenacin,</b> are safer than the old ones...|$|E
