500|$|Although Howarth was {{familiar}} with campus fraternity life while attending George Washington University, he did not base Todd or his other roles on anyone he knew. [...] When asked about his roles, {{he was unable to}} explain why he was consistently cast as a bad guy, but said that he enjoyed it. [...] "I would never want to come in now and play a nice guy for three months. That would be dreadfully boring. This suits me fine. It's <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> to pretend I'm a bad guy as it is to pretend I'm a good guy," [...] Howarth said. Playing a rapist was like playing any other role because [...] " [...] it's all make-believe". He was perplexed by writers' need to redeem villains. [...] "Todd's a pretty interesting character just the way he is," [...] Howarth said in late 1994. [...] "There's no need to fix it if it's not broken. I don't know where the whole notion of redeeming characters comes from. People used to say to me, 'I hope you get redeemed so you can stay on the show.' Well, Todd hasn't been redeemed, and he's still on the show." [...] He added, [...] "I don't love the character I play. If I met Todd on the street, I wouldn't say 'Hi' to him, but I do love playing this character." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vowels are {{constructed}} from {{only a handful}} of basic symbols, but they can be combined with other vowel forms and semi-vowels to represent the full repertoire of diphthongs and triphthongs used in the language. Vowels cannot stand alone or begin a syllable, so the silent consonant, ອ, which can function as a vowel in its own right, is used as a base when spelling a word that begins with a vowel sound. The names of the vowels are <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> as saying sala (ສະຫລະ, [...] ) before the vowel sign. Some vowels have unique names, and these are ໃ- (ໄມ້ມ້ວນ, , rolled stem), ໄ- (ໄມ້ມາຽ, , unwound stem), [...] -ົ (ໄມ້ກົງ, [...] , straight stem), -ັ (ໄມ້ກັນ, [...] , ear stem), -ຽ (ວິຣາມ, [...] ), and -ໍ (ນິກຄະຫິດ, [...] ). [...] Although a short dash is used on this page to represent the consonant, in standard Lao orthography a small x symbol is used for this purpose. Traditionally this was a simple, stylized, sans-serif x and it was included in Lao fonts before unicode became widespread. Unicode does not make it available as part of the Lao alphabet set, and a lower-case sans-serif x is often used instead.|$|E

5000|$|This {{standard}} motorcycle {{was introduced}} as a balanced bike that was <b>just</b> <b>as</b> enjoyable yet <b>easier</b> {{to ride in}} town than its larger Magna siblings, with good power and a broad torque band. Thanks to its V4 design, power in the 500 engine is not peaky and ample torque can be found throughout the rev band, and the six-speed transmission ratio was unique to this bike versus the ratio on the VF500F.

Moreover, all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proofs in an MIP system, without any additional assumptions; this is only known for IP assuming the existence of one-way functions.|$|R

Compliance with simpler specification standards, however, can be attained <b>just</b> <b>as</b> well with <b>easier</b> to administer deterrent enforcement strategies based on frequent inspections and adequate sanctions. ...|$|R
