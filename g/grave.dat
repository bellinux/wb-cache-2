5|$|Forensic archaeologists {{can help}} {{determine}} potential <b>grave</b> sites {{that might have}} been overlooked. Differences in the soil can help forensic archaeologists locate these sites. During the burial of a body, a small mound of soil will form from the filling of the <b>grave.</b> The loose soil and increasing nutrients from the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas. Typically, <b>grave</b> sites will have looser, darker, more organic soil than areas around it. The search for additional <b>grave</b> sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and mass graves to search for additional burial locations.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, bodies {{believed}} to be those of the Imperial Family and their servants were finally exhumed from a mass <b>grave</b> in the woods outside Yekaterinburg. The <b>grave</b> had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who still ruled Russia when the <b>grave</b> was originally found. Once the <b>grave</b> was opened, the excavators realized that instead of eleven sets of remains (Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, Tsarevitch Alexei, the four Grand Duchesses, Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia; the family's doctor, Yevgeny Botkin; their valet, Alexei Trupp; their cook, Ivan Kharitonov; and Alexandra's maid, Anna Demidova) the <b>grave</b> held only nine. Alexei and, according to the late forensic expert Dr. William Maples, Anastasia were missing from the family's <b>grave.</b> Russian scientists contested this, however, and claimed it was Maria's body that was missing. The Russians identified Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest Grand Duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass <b>grave.</b> They estimated {{the height and width}} of the skulls where pieces of bone were missing. American scientists found this method inexact. A Russian forensic expert said none of the skulls attributed to the Grand Duchesses had a gap between the front teeth as Maria did.|$|E
