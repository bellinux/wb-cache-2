5|$|McCudden {{had always}} found it {{difficult}} to intercept high-flying German reconnaissance aircraft. The latest Rumpler C.VII which had entered service proved particularly elusive. With a 240 <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> engine, it could reach 24,000 feet and was thus beyond the reach of any prospective adversary. The average S.E.5, at that point, could reach only 17,000 feet. While most pilots were prepared to accept this tactical-technological situation, McCudden was not.|$|E
5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 <b>horse</b> <b>power,</b> the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 300,000 horses {{existed in}} Finland when the Finnhorse {{studbook}} {{was established in}} the beginning of the 20thcentury. The horse population, consisting almost entirely of Finnhorses, remained stable for 50 years. The rebuilding of the country after two wars had increased demand for <b>horse</b> <b>power,</b> and by the 1950s, the breed reached its all-time peak, with an estimated 409,000 animals, with a great majority of the horses being of the draught type. However, with the increased mechanisation of agriculture and forestry in the 1960s, the number of Finnhorses dropped precipitously. Horses, having been bred in large numbers only a few years earlier, were taken to slaughter by the thousands; a change in forestry tax policy made previously state-supported horse-powered forestry unprofitable and further discouraged keeping horses. Many working horse bloodlines ended, while lines more suitable for sports and recreation survived. By the 1970s, the breed's numbers had declined to 90,000 animals, and 10 years later as few as 20,000 Finnhorses existed. The breed's all-time lowest point was 1987, with only 14,100 horses. By this time, however, the overall horse population in Finland had been increasing for almost a decade, with lighter harness racing horse breeds establishing their position, counting 12,800 animals the same year.|$|E

5|$|The {{size of the}} ice houses made it {{difficult}} to load ice into them; in 1827 Wyeth invented a lever and horse-drawn pulley system to raise blocks of ice through the roofs of the warehouses. Later improvements to loading included the use of lift systems to raise the blocks of ice {{to the top of the}} building, first using <b>horse</b> <b>power,</b> then steam power; the largest warehouses later introduced conveyor belt systems to bring the ice into storage. Power houses containing the equipment to support these were built alongside the ice houses, and care was taken to avoid the risk of fire from this machinery. Warehouses were typically painted either white or yellow in order to reflect the sun during the summer. A typical Hudson River warehouse might be 400 feet (120 m) long, 100 feet (30 m) deep and three stories high, able to hold 50,000 tons (four million kg) of ice. The later railroad ice houses could hold up to 250,000 tons (220 million kg) apiece.|$|E

There is a saddler-at-work display, plus horse brasses, horseshoes and other harness. In a stable there is a blacksmith's workshop and farriery display, complete with many horseshoes, anvils, and metalworking tools.|$|E
25|$|The company {{failed to}} raise {{sufficient}} capital {{to complete their}} schemes and so sold out to a new Plymouth Tramways Company in 1886. This company closed the line from the town centre to the Barbican and introduced <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> on the remaining routes. The steam engines were sold to the Swanscombe Colliery in Kent where they worked until 1922. The company operated the tramway until 1892 when it was sold to Plymouth Corporation for £12,500.|$|E

25|$|On January 1, 1838, the M was {{extended}} their route to Morristown. On October 29 of that year, an agreement was signed {{to move the}} NJRR connection {{to the foot of}} Centre Street (via the northeast side of Park Place, to the NJRR alignment along the Passaic River), and the track on Broad Street was removed. Through car service began August 1, 1843, with <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> used along the streets, between Broad Street station and the foot of Centre Street.|$|E
25|$|Road steam {{disappeared}} through {{restrictions and}} charges that drove up their operating costs. Through 1921, steam tractors had demonstrated clear economic advantages over <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> for heavy hauling and short journeys. However, petrol lorries {{were starting to}} show better efficiency and could be purchased cheaply as war surplus; on a busy route a 3-ton petrol lorry could save about £100 per month compared to its steam equivalent, in spite of restrictive speed limits, and relatively high fuel prices and maintenance costs.|$|E
25|$|Horse buses {{supplemented}} {{the services}} whilst track relaying {{was carried out}} for the new electric trams. On 17 April 1901 a horse tram service operated from Gregory Boulevard to Bulwell Market over the new rails. As the section of track between Gregory Boulevard and the Market place was re-laid, gradually the horse tram service was extended such that on 29 June trams were operating the complete journey from Nottingham to Bulwell. This lasted {{less than a month}} and electric vehicles replaced <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> on 23 July 1901.|$|E
2500|$|Street trams {{have been}} {{operated}} since 1888, first <b>horse</b> <b>powered,</b> then electrical ones in 1896. The line ("Red") {{ran along the}} entire length of the street from Main Railway Station to Gdanska Street; in 1948, line designation was changed to [...] "A".|$|R

25|$|Thomas Somers and the Cabot Brothers {{founded the}} Beverly Cotton Manufactory in 1787, the first cotton mill in America, the largest cotton mill of its era, and a {{significant}} milestone in {{the research and development}} of cotton mills in the future. This mill was designed to use <b>horse</b> <b>power,</b> but the operators quickly learned that the horse-drawn platform was economically unstable, and had economic losses for years. Despite the losses, the Manufactory served as a playground of innovation, both in turning a large amount of cotton, but also developing the water-powered milling structure used in Slater's Mill.|$|E
25|$|The Bergen Hill Cut, {{the last}} part of the Jersey City–New Brunswick line to be finished, opened January 22, 1838, {{replacing}} the old temporary alignment over the hill and ending the use of <b>horse</b> <b>power.</b> On March 15, 1837 a supplement to the C's charter was passed, allowing the branch to New Brunswick connecting with the New Jersey Rail Road to branch off of the C at Bordentown rather than Spotswood, to pass through Trenton for a connection with the Trenton Delaware Bridge and the Philadelphia & Trenton Railroad. Portions could be built next to the Delaware and Raritan Canal or along the New Brunswick and Trenton Turnpike.|$|E
25|$|Power {{boats are}} only {{permitted}} on some Prince Albert National Park lakes. Motor boats are allowed on Waskesiu, Crean, Kingsmere, Sandy and the Hanging Heart Lakes. There {{is a limit}} of 40 <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> motors on Kingsmere. The Waskesiu Marina, Heart Lakes Marina and the Narrows have boat launches (permit and fee required) and docks. Boat, canoe and kayak rentals are available at all three, by the hour or by the day. The Waskesiu Marina has a concrete breakwater. A permit is required to use boat launch facilities. Personal watercraft are not allowed on any lakes. Canoes, kayaks and sail boats are allowed on all waters.|$|E

50|$|The mills used to manufacture, ferment, store, {{and ship}} juice {{products}} are usually located near apple orchards.

50|$|Bell {{invented the}} reaping machine {{while working on}} his father's farm. His {{interest}} in mechanics led him {{to work on a}} <b>horse</b> <b>powered</b> mechanical reaper for speeding up the harvest. In 1828 his machine was used with success on his father's farm and others in the district.|$|R
25|$|These {{advances}} were capitalised on by entrepreneurs, of {{whom the}} best known is Richard Arkwright. He is credited {{with a list of}} inventions, but these were actually developed by such people as Thomas Highs and John Kay; Arkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. He created the cotton mill which brought the production processes together in a factory, and he developed the use of power – first <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> and then water powerwhich made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry. Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling) so that the supply of yarn increased greatly. Before long steam power was applied to drive textile machinery. Manchester acquired the nickname Cottonopolis during the early 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories.|$|E
25|$|The Harlem Line in {{its current}} form {{originated}} from the New York and Harlem Railroad, which was the first streetcar company in the United States and in the world. It was franchised, on April 25, 1831, to run between the original city core in lower Manhattan to the suburb of Harlem, several miles to the north on Manhattan Island. The line was originally planned to run between 23rd Street and any point on the Harlem River between Eighth and Third Avenue. While the company wanted to run the line as a steam line, the portion of the line south of 14th Street was run by <b>horse</b> <b>power,</b> {{at the request of the}} city. On September 13, 1831, the Board of Directors of the railroad approved its route along Fourth Avenue from 23rd Street to the Harlem River. Ground broke on the construction of the line on February 23, 1832 at Murray Hill on Fourth Avenue. On April 6, 1832, the railroad's charter was amended to allow the line to be extended south to 14th Street.|$|E
25|$|Regular NJRR service began September 15, 1834 between Newark and Jersey City, using a {{temporary}} track over Bergen Hill. An extension to Elizabeth opened December 21, 1835, using the turnpike {{from the south}} end of Broad Street. Service to Rahway began January 1, 1836, again along the turnpike from a point south of Elizabeth. Locomotives were only used south of Newark until January 11, though some <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> operations continued east of Newark. The line opened to east of New Brunswick July 11, with an omnibus transfer the rest of the way; the turnpike was used north of Iselin. On September 8, 1836 the NJRR acquired a majority of stock of the New Brunswick Bridge Company to avoid its local monopoly over crossings of the Raritan River. The double-deck bridge over the Raritan opened October 31, 1837, with a road beneath the railroad, taking the NJRR to New Brunswick. The New Brunswick Bridge Company was authorized to charge a toll on the lower level on May 7, 1838. The old 1795 Albany Street Bridge was removed in 1849, but was later rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|Whilst the {{introduction}} of railways (steam or <b>horse</b> <b>powered)</b> generally spelt the end of coach services on directly competing routes, it provided opportunities for feeder coach services as shown on the advertisement for 'The Queen' coach put on between Scarborough, Pickering and Helmsley only {{two months after the}} W opened.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1956, the A5s steam {{locomotives}} {{started to be}} replaced by higher <b>horse</b> <b>powered</b> and heavy duty diesel switchers. Over the next year, these switchers were gradually replaced by diesel locomotives. Finally in 1957, the Pennsylvania Railroad converted from steam to diesel power and {{the end of an era}} was finished.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} units in across the state.
