5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron {{by means of a}} cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization. Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a <b>fining</b> process.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the Dutch brick {{industry}} has attracted unwelcome attention from the European Union (EU) competition authorities. In the early 1990s the industry had excess capacity due to technological advances, competition from other materials and an economic slowdown. Producers with combined market share of 90% agreed to reduce capacity, shutting down the older and inefficient plants. The producers compensated those who closed plants. However, the agreement also included fixing production quotas and <b>fining</b> members who produced more than their quota. The members of what was in effect a cartel were forced to drop the quota agreement by the EU.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the master thesis was a <b>fine</b> arts colony for primary school pupils as {{motivation}} for <b>fine</b> arts activity. In general, {{there have been few}} studies and papers on <b>fine</b> arts colonies for primary school pupils. A <b>fine</b> arts colony is organised outside the standard space, classroom, and provides a possibility of a wider and deeper exploration of all <b>fine</b> arts fields and techniques. Each year, educators receive tenders for <b>fine</b> arts colonies, but can apply {{only a limited number of}} pupils. Therefore, our current practice is to only apply pupils gifted in <b>fine</b> arts. We can consequently conclude that there are likely many pupils also gifted in <b>fine</b> arts that do not attend the <b>fine</b> arts colony. The objective of the study was to determine the interest for attending the <b>fine</b> arts colony, whether the colony motivates pupils for additional <b>fine</b> arts activity, or is it just another competition, or <b>fine</b> arts contest, which stimulates pupils for <b>fine</b> arts with its external motivational assets (high prizes for selected works for an exhibition, recognition for award-winning works, etc.). The objective of the study was to prove that a <b>fine</b> arts colony is a means of motivation for <b>fine</b> arts activities for all pupils. In the theoretical section, we have emphasised motivation in the learning process, motivation for <b>fine</b> arts creativity, goals and purpose of organising the <b>fine</b> arts colony, comparison of <b>fine</b> arts colonies with contests and ex tempore and <b>fine</b> arts colonies as additional work with gifted pupils. The empirical section of the study is composed of two parts: quantitative non-experimental questionnaire for pupils that attended the colony and for those that did not attend the colony. The qualitative research includes case study of pupils that were identified and included in a personalised programme for gifted pupils and those that were not. By analysing <b>fine</b> arts works, we have presented the difference in motivation for work in a classroom and <b>fine</b> arts activity in a <b>fine</b> arts colony. The results of the qualitative and quantitative study will contribute to a new didactic quality of <b>fine</b> arts courses in the <b>fine</b> arts colony framework. They will contribute an insight into methods of teaching and work with gifted pupils in the field of <b>fine</b> arts. We have designed a model for planning and implementing a <b>fine</b> arts colony, where pupils will acquire quality <b>fine</b> arts experience and will be additionally motivated for <b>fine</b> arts activity. ...|$|R

40|$|Properties of the {{recycled}} <b>fine</b> aggregates and the {{suitability of}} the same in cementitious mortar were studied and {{compared with those of}} natural <b>fine</b> aggregates. The results showed that the particle size distribution of recycled <b>fine</b> aggregates is compatible with those of natural <b>fine</b> aggregates. The recycled <b>fine</b> aggregates had <b>fine</b> fraction and bulk density of 13. 47 % and 1407 kg/m 3, respectively while those of the natural <b>fine</b> aggregates were 1. 51 % and 1453 kg/m 3, respectively. Specific Gravity of recycled <b>fine</b> aggregates was 2. 499 with compared to 2. 408 of Natural <b>fine</b> aggregates and the water absorption was 6. 325 % with compared to 0. 71 % of Natural <b>fine</b> aggregates. Chloride Content of recycled <b>fine</b> aggregate was 0. 0150 % with compared to 0. 0005 % of natural <b>fine</b> aggregate. Properties of mortar made fewer than five testing scenarios consisting different proportions of natural <b>fine</b> aggregate to recycle <b>fine</b> aggregate as 100 %- 0 %, 75 %- 25 %, 50 % - 50 %, 25 %- 75 %, and 0 %- 100 % were compared with those of 100 % natural <b>fine</b> aggregates. With increasing percentage of recycled aggregate content, compressive strength increased in 0. 7 Water cement ratio while the workability decreased. According to the results, mortar properties could be achieved with mix proportions of 50 % natural <b>fine</b> aggregate and 50 % recycled <b>fine</b> aggregate, without significantly affecting the mortar properties, indicating a 50 % saving of natural <b>fine</b> aggregates thus reducing environmental impacts and enhancing sustainability...|$|R
5|$|Sometime between May and July 1108, Henry {{addressed}} a writ to Urse and the Bishop of Worcester from Reading. The royal document commanded the sheriff not summon the shire and hundred courts to locations different than customary nor that he summon them on dates {{other than those}} normal for such courts. From this, the historian Judith Green speculates that Urse had been summoning these courts at unusual times and then <b>fining</b> {{those who did not}} attend.

The dean's actions were contrary to a royal decree, but although he appeared before a royal court he escaped secular penalties because he was a clerk. The result of the case, a precursor to the later Becket dispute, aroused King Henry's anger, but the death of the king's brother Geoffrey and the king's subsequent travel to the Continent to deal with that issue meant that the matter was eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|The parity of zero is {{relevant}} to odd–even rationing, in which cars may drive or purchase gasoline on alternate days, according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates.

However, in 1977, a Paris rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided <b>fining</b> drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did not know whether 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Barnard's Inn, {{originally}} {{known as}} Mackworth's Inn after its owner, John Mackworth, {{was established in}} 1454 as an Inn of Chancery. A large Inn, Barnard's had 112 students a year {{during the reign of}} Elizabeth I with 24 in permanent residence. When it was an institute of legal education, it enforced the odd practice of <b>fining</b> a student when he got something wrong: a halfpenny for a defective word, a farthing for a defective syllable and a penny for an improper word. Barnard's was under the supervision of Gray's Inn, who traditionally sent a Reader to the Inn every year, who was treated with great respect. Noted pupils included Sir John Holt, later a distinguished jurist. The Inn was badly damaged in the Gordon Riots after a rioter set fire to the distillery next door. In 1880 it was bought by the Worshipful Company of Mercers and used to house the Mercers' School.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Sir Roger Lewknor in 1543, his estates were divided among his descendants, and the castle and manor were split. John Levett of Salehurst {{purchased}} the castle in 1588. In 1623, most of the estates of Bodiam were bought by Sir Nicholas Tufton, later Earl of Thanet. His son, John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet, inherited Nicholas's property on his father's death in 1631; it was John Tufton who reunited possession of castle and manor when he bought Bodiam Castle in 1639. John Tufton was {{a supporter of the}} Royalist cause during the English Civil War, and led an attack on Lewes, and was involved in a Royalist defeat at Haywards Heath.

To help pay his fine, Tufton sold Bodiam Castle for £6,000 (£ today) in March 1644 to Nathaniel Powell, a Parliamentarian.|$|E
5|$|The first {{drinking}} age law in New Jersey {{was passed}} in 1846. It allowed {{the parents of a}} student under 21 to sue for up to $10 ($ in modern dollars) in damages against a tavern keeper or shopkeeper who supplied alcoholic beverages to their children. In 1880, a criminal statute was enacted, <b>fining</b> businesses that sold liquor to people under 18 if their parents had told the establishment not to sell to their child. The law was amended in 1888 to eliminate the parental consent provision, thus making it illegal in all cases for a tavern or liquor store to sell alcohol to person under 18. In 1908, the penalties were increased so that a tavern keeper who served a minor could be jailed. Upon the start of Prohibition, New Jersey repealed its laws regarding the sale of alcohol to minors since the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited almost all liquor sales.|$|E

5|$|Following Radama II's {{apparent}} death, rumors {{spread that}} he had only been rendered unconscious by the attempt on his life and had revived as his body was being transported to Ilafy for interment in his designated tomb. French historian Delval presents evidence that supports a scenario wherein the group tasked with carrying Radama's body to Ilafy became frightened as the king began to revive, prompting them to abandon the body and then falsely maintain that they had completed their task to place him in the tomb. Within months after his reported death, rumors began circulating that Radama was alive, residing {{on the west coast}} of the island and was amassing supporters for a political comeback. The rumors persisted to the point of causing political turmoil in Antananarivo. These claims may have had some substance judging by the actions of others. Prominent Christian missionaries outside the capital made extensive efforts to visit and support Radama but seemingly never succeeded. Traditionalist factions within the government were concerned enough by the rumors to have put to death sixteen of his supporters, as well as <b>fining</b> hundreds of others. According to evidence in Delval's study, Radama may indeed have survived and, failing to regain the throne, lived to old age as an ordinary citizen in the north of the island.|$|E
