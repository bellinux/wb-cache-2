5|$|Directly {{under the}} {{subtropical}} ridge are the doldrums, or <b>horse</b> <b>latitudes,</b> where winds are lighter. Many of the Earth's deserts lie near the average latitude of the subtropical ridge, where descent reduces the relative humidity {{of the air}} mass. The strongest winds are in the mid-latitudes where cold polar air meets warm air from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{are also}} classified, {{according}} to their geographical location and dominant weather pattern, as trade wind, mid-latitude, rain shadow, coastal, monsoon, or polar deserts. Trade wind deserts occur {{either side of the}} <b>horse</b> <b>latitudes</b> at 30° to 35° North and South. These belts are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large-scale descent of dry air moving from high-altitudes toward the poles. The Sahara Desert is of this type. Mid-latitude deserts occur between 30° and 50° North and South. They are mostly in areas remote from the sea where most of the moisture has already precipitated from the prevailing winds. They include the Tengger and Sonoran Deserts. Monsoon deserts are similar. They occur in regions where large temperature differences occur between sea and land. Moist warm air rises over the land, deposits its water content and circulates back to sea. Further inland, areas receive very little precipitation. The Thar Desert near the India/Pakistan border is of this type.|$|E
5|$|Isobaric {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal mean sea level pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and minima in the pressure field. The minima are called low-pressure areas while the maxima are called high-pressure areas. Highs are often shown as H's whereas lows are shown as L's. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the <b>horse</b> <b>latitudes</b> poleward, while streamline analyses {{are used in the}} tropics. A streamline {{analysis is}} a series of arrows oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. C's depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while A's depict anticyclonic flow or likely positions of high-pressure areas. An area of confluent streamlines shows the location of shearlines within the tropics and subtropics.|$|E

Most adapted by innovating to create new forms that combined pre-Soviet subsistence practices with contemporary modes. This paper explores one group's innovation, 'cows-and-kin'. Viliui Sakha, the highest <b>latitude</b> <b>horse</b> and cattle breeders in contemporary times, inhabit western Sakha, northeastern Siberia, Russia. Their cows-and-kin innovation is based on household-level cow keeping with interdependence of kin households. In addition to describing this post-soviet community-level innovation, this paper also explores relevant issues about the capacity for continued innovation such as: (1) what {{is the future of}} the cows-and-kin innovation, considering that many youth are out-migrating from the rural villages? (2) how is the cows-and-kin innovation affected by the forces of globalisation and modernity? and lastly (3) how can the cows-and-kin innovation face the challenges posed by rapid climate change?innovation; climate change; adaptation; Viliui Sakha; post-Soviet; Arctic indigenous peoples; indigenous culture; rural Russia; globalisation; modernity; agricultural infrastructure. ...|$|R
40|$|Abiotic inputs such as {{photoperiod}} {{and temperature}} can regulate reproductive cyclicity in many species. When humans perturb this process by intervening in reproductive cycles, the ecological consequences may be profound. Trophic mismatches between birth pulse and resources in wildlife species may cascade toward decreased survival and threaten {{the viability of}} small populations. We followed feral horses (Equus caballus) in three populations for a longitudinal study of the transient immunocontraceptive porcine zona pellucida (PZP), and found that repeated vaccinations extended the duration of infertility far beyond the targeted period. After the targeted years of infertility, the probability of parturition from post-treated females was 25. 6 % compared to 64. 1 % for untreated females, when the data were constrained only to females that had demonstrated fertility prior to the study. Estimated time to parturition increased 411. 3 days per year of consecutive historical treatment. Births from untreated females in these temperate latitude populations were observed to peak {{in the middle of}} May, indicating peak conception occurred around the previous summer solstice. When the post-treated females did conceive and give birth, parturition was an estimated 31. 5 days later than births from untreated females, resulting in asynchrony with peak forage availability. The latest neonate born to a post-treated female arrived 7. 5 months after the peak in births from untreated females, indicating conception occurred within 24 – 31 days of the winter solstice. These results demonstrate surprising physiological plasticity for temperate <b>latitude</b> <b>horses,</b> and indicate that while photoperiod an...|$|R

25|$|The Sahara is the world's largest low-latitude hot desert. The area {{is located}} in the <b>horse</b> <b>latitudes</b> under the {{subtropical}} ridge, a significant belt of semi-permanent subtropical warm-core high pressure where the air from upper levels of the troposphere tends to sink towards the ground. This steady descending airflow causes a warming and a drying effect in the upper troposphere. The sinking air prevents evaporating water from rising and, therefore, prevents the adiabatic cooling, which makes cloud formation extremely difficult to nearly impossible.|$|E
500|$|The westerlies, anti-trades, or {{prevailing}} westerlies, are [...] prevailing winds {{from the}} west toward the east in the middle latitudes between 30 and 60 degrees latitude. They originate from the high-pressure areas in the <b>horse</b> <b>latitudes</b> and tend towards the poles and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. Tropical cyclones which cross the subtropical ridge axis into the westerlies recurve due to the increased westerly flow. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, {{the term}} semi-tropical and quasi-tropical {{were used for}} what would become known as {{subtropical}} cyclones. [...] The term subtropical cyclone merely referred to any cyclone located in the subtropical belt near and {{just north of the}} <b>horse</b> <b>latitudes.</b> [...] Intense debate ensued in the late 1960s, after a number of hybrid cyclones formed in the Atlantic Basin. [...] In 1972, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) finally designated these storms as subtropical cyclones in real-time, [...] and updated the hurricane database to include subtropical cyclones from 1968 through 1971.|$|E
500|$|The {{westerlies}} or {{the prevailing}} westerlies are the prevailing winds {{in the middle}} latitudes (i.e., between 35 and 65 degrees latitude), which blow in areas poleward of the high pressure area known as the subtropical ridge in the <b>horse</b> <b>latitudes.</b> These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east, and steer extra-tropical cyclones in this general manner. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. [...] They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, such as when the polar cyclone is strongest, and weakest during the summer when the polar cyclone is weakest and when pressures are higher over the poles.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} climatology, high {{pressure}} forms at the <b>horse</b> <b>latitudes,</b> or torrid zone, between the latitudes of 20 and 40 {{degrees from the}} equator, {{as a result of}} air that has been uplifted at the equator. [...] As the hot air rises it cools, losing moisture; it is then transported poleward where it descends, creating the high-pressure area. [...] This is part of the Hadley cell circulation and is known as the subtropical ridge or subtropical high, and is strongest in the summer. [...] The subtropical ridge is a warm core high-pressure system, meaning it strengthens with height. [...] Many of the world's deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure systems.|$|E

500|$|The {{subtropical}} ridge, {{also known}} as the subtropical high or <b>horse</b> <b>latitudes,</b> is a significant belt of atmospheric high pressure situated around the latitudes of 30°N in the Northern Hemisphere and 30°S in the Southern Hemisphere. It is the product of the global air circulation cell known as the Hadley Cell. The subtropical ridge is characterized by mostly calm winds, which act to reduce air quality under its axis by causing fog overnight, and haze during daylight hours {{as a result of the}} stable atmosphere found near its location. The air descending from the upper troposphere flows out from its center at surface level toward the upper and lower latitudes of each hemisphere, creating both the trade winds and the westerlies. The subtropical ridge moves poleward during the summer, reaching its most northern latitude in early fall, before moving equatorward during the cold season. The El Niño southern climate oscillation (ENSO) can displace the northern hemisphere subtropical ridge, with La Niñas allowing for a more northerly axis for the ridge, while El Niños show flatter, more southerly ridges. [...] The change of the ridge position during ENSO cycles changes the tracks of tropical cyclones that form around their equatorward and western peripheries. As the subtropical ridge varies in position and strength, it can enhance or depress monsoon regimes around their low-latitude periphery. The term [...] "horse latitudes" [...] refers to and is synonymous with the subtropical ridge or subtropical high.|$|E
