A reviewer for Soulbounce commented {{that for the}} [...] "pulsing" [...] song, Jackson became a house music diva. Complex noted that [...] "Throb" [...] is [...] "the hip-house tantric jam that's Janet at her most explicit: moans, groans, 'damn, baby', you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> yes". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented: [...] "Even the nearly structure-less 'Throb', [...] feels like a (perhaps unintentional) parody of Madonna's 'Erotica', {{right down to the}} hard, house-orgy beats.|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Life" [...] was raved {{by music}} critics. John Calvert of The Quietus {{described}} the song as [...] "really big. Like R. Kelly's [...] "I Believe I Can Fly" [...] big. Like Superman eating a super hotdog while fighting King Kong while...ok you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> If {{you were looking}} around for a high concept pitch-style descriptor, with its synth brass and Philly soul strings {{you might call it}} 'Stevie Wonder meets N.E.R.D in space'. But then that would be too simplistic a definition for the multifaceted, resolutely accomplished 'Sweet Thing'." [...] Pitchforks Larry Fitzmaurice labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and noted that [...] "this was a week where Frank Ocean bravely invited us to learn more about his personal story; 'Sweet Life' is another reminder of how well he can structure a narrative in the musical realm." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick noted that Ocean took the R genre and pushed it out into strange new places, with tracks like the [...] "blissful, jazzy jigsaw of 'Sweet Life', which seems to assemble itself from disconnected elements as it goes along." [...] AllMusic's Andy Kellman mused that the track served as one of the album's lighter moments, and wrote that [...] "the bright 'Sweet Life' and the relatively exuberant 'Monks,' both of which would be standouts on any N.E.R.D. album, offer more than bright coating, dealing in surrealism and sharp observations that are equally penetrating." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] in [...] "A Transatlantic Interview - 1946", Stein insisted that this work was completely [...] "realistic" [...] {{in the tradition of}} Gustave Flaubert, stating the following: [...] "I used to take objects on a table, like a tumbler or any kind of object and try to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of it clear and separate in my mind and create a word relationship between the word and the things seen." [...] Commentators have indicated that what she meant was that the reference of objects remained central to her work, although the representation of them had not. Scholar Marjorie Perloff had said of Stein that [...] "nlike her contemporaries (Eliot, Pound, Moore), she does not give us an image, however fractured, of a carafe on a table; rather, she forces us to reconsider how language actually constructs the world we know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Director Guillermo del Toro and screenwriter Matthew Robbins wrote a {{screenplay}} based on Lovecraft's story in 2006, but {{had trouble getting}} Warner Bros. to finance the project. Del Toro wrote, [...] "The studio is very nervous about the cost and it not having a love story or a happy ending, but it's impossible to do either in the Lovecraft universe." [...] In July 2010 {{it was announced that}} the film would be made in 3D and that James Cameron would become producer, and Tom Cruise was attached to star. This [...] "was a startling prospect considering Lovecraft's tale had long been considered unfilmable." [...] Del Toro confirmed that the film would begin production as early as May 2011 and start filming in June. However, in March 2011, it was announced that [...] "Universal Studios refused to greenlight the project due to del Toro's insistence that it be released with an R rating rather than a PG-13." [...] In 2012, del Toro posted that, due to the resemblance in premise with the Ridley Scott film Prometheus, the project would probably face a [...] "long pause—if not demise". [...] In 2013, del Toro stated {{in an interview that he}} would try one more time to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> made.|$|E

Also, in some way, to the end of this rope was fastened a sizable block that might have weighed ten pounds. Possum, running free, was fooling around the chicken-coop on top the 'midship- house.
