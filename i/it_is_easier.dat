5|$|Many guitar picks {{employ the}} Reuleaux triangle, as its shape {{combines}} a sharp point to provide strong articulation, {{with a wide}} tip to produce a warm timbre. Because all three points of the shape are usable, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to orient and wears less quickly compared to a pick with a single tip.|$|E

5|$|The Koch {{index is}} the ratio between peak {{steering}} torque {{and the product}} of peak lean rate and forward speed.

5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air. He must also account for {{the height of the}} ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E
5|$|As {{they read}} the end, Joan of Arc is being burnt at the stake, still waiting for God to save her (the real Joan had said several days earlier that her voices had spoken to her of martyrdom). Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death. Marge then interrupts, {{claiming}} that Joan of Arc was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship. She then rips out the last page and eats it, remarking that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to chew than the video of Bambi.|$|E

5|$|Depending {{on their}} feeding habits, {{termites}} are placed into two groups: the lower termites and higher termites. The lower termites predominately feed on wood. As wood {{is difficult to}} digest, termites prefer to consume fungus-infected wood because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to digest and the fungi are high in protein. Meanwhile, the higher termites consume {{a wide variety of}} materials, including faeces, humus, grass, leaves and roots. The gut in the lower termites contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa, while the higher termites only have a few species of bacteria with no protozoa.|$|E
5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much more so than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E

5|$|Receipt of Banking Services: A Lebanese Identity Card holder {{can use the}} Lebanese Identity Card as {{identity}} verification document when opening bank account, withdrawing money from the bank or receiving money transfers in the Republic of Lebanon. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> for a Lebanese Identity Card holder to also take loan from the bank whether you work in an identifiable institution or not. This is because their identity can be easily verified and the banks are confident {{that they can be}} traced in the event of loan default based on their PIN or biometric information stored on the Lebanese Identity Card.|$|E
5|$|The {{accusations against}} Clarence, Stephen, Gull and Druitt also draw on {{cultural}} {{perceptions of a}} decadent ruling class, and depict a high-born murderer or murderers preying on lower-class victims. Because Druitt and the other upper-middle-class and aristocratic Ripper suspects were wealthy, there is more biographical material on them than on {{the residents of the}} Whitechapel slums. Consequently, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> for writers to construct solutions based on a wealthy culprit rather than one involving a Whitechapel resident. There is no direct evidence against Druitt, and since the 1970s, the number of Jack the Ripper suspects has continued to grow, with the result that there are now over 100 different theories about the Ripper's identity.|$|E
5|$|M34 is an {{open cluster}} that appears at {{magnitude}} 5.5, and is approximately 1,500 light-years from Earth. It contains about 100 stars scattered over a field of view larger {{than that of the}} full moon. M34 can be resolved with good eyesight but is best viewed using a telescope at low magnifications. IC 348 is a somewhat young open cluster that is still contained within the nebula from which its stars formed. It is located about 1,027 light-years from Earth, is about 2 million years old, and contains many stars with circumstellar disks. Many brown dwarfs have been discovered in this cluster due to its age; since brown dwarfs cool as they age, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to find them in younger clusters.|$|E

5|$|Since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> for a snake's {{tongue to}} fulfill its {{olfactory}} function under water, its action is short {{compared to that of}} terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch {{in the middle of the}} rostral scale. The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for an animal that must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become very large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system of}} Mortal Kombat II is an improved {{version of that}} from the original Mortal Kombat. There are several changes in standard moves: a crouching punch and turnaround kick are added, low and high kicks have greater differentiation (be they crouching or standing up), the roundhouse kick are made more powerful (knocking an opponent across the screen, like the game's uppercut), and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to perform a combo due to reduced recovery times for attacks. Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some {{to be used in}} mid-air, and the game plays almost twice as fast as the original. However, all playable characters in the game still share most generic attributes (such as power and jump height) and all normal moves are also the same between each character.|$|E
5|$|The reactivities of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. This {{is the result of}} a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.|$|E

5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{starts in}} a {{courtroom}} where Lisa is on trial. The Blue-Haired Lawyer is accusing her of bringing devastation upon Springfield because of her selfish desire {{to be accepted by}} others. Lisa starts telling everyone in the courtroom about her side of the story. A few months ago, she and her family went to the new mall in town. There, she encountered her schoolmates Sherri and Terri and asked them if she could spend some time with them at the mall. The two twins said no to Lisa, which made her realize that she has no real friends. Later, Lisa went on Homer's computer and discovered that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to make friends online than in real life, and thus she started a social networking website called SpringFace to get friends. The site became instantly popular among all the citizens of Springfield and Lisa made over a thousand friends {{in a short period of}} time. However, Lisa soon noticed that these friends only talked to her on SpringFace and not in real life. She also discovered that the website grew too big to control, with people becoming so addicted to it that they even used it while driving their cars. This caused chaos in the town after numerous car crashes and deaths.|$|E
