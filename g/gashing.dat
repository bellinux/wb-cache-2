Le Mat, Harrison Ford and Bo Hopkins were claimed to be drunk most nights and every weekend, and had conducted climbing competitions {{to the top of the}} local Holiday Inn sign. One actor set fire to Lucas's motel room. Another night, Le Mat threw Richard Dreyfuss into a swimming pool, <b>gashing</b> Dreyfuss' forehead on the day before he was due to have his close-ups filmed. Dreyfuss also complained over the wardrobe that Lucas had chosen for the character. Ford was kicked out of his motel room at the Holiday Inn. In addition, two camera operators were nearly killed when filming the climactic race scene on Frates Road outside Petaluma. Principal photography ended on August 4, 1972.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{arrived at}} Pearl on 10 June and {{remained}} {{for several days}} before departing for Bremerton to begin an overhaul scheduled to last several months. Captain Cassady was relieved by Captain Thomas Sisson on 22 June although he was only briefly in command before Captain Lucian A. Moebus assumed command on 31 July. Saratoga completed her post-refit sea trials on 13 September and arrived at the Naval Air Station Alameda on 16 September to begin loading 85 aircraft, 1500 passengers and cargo bound for Pearl Harbor. She departed San Francisco two days later and arrived on 24 September. The ship was assigned to Carrier Division 11 which was tasked to train night fighter pilots and to develop night tactics and doctrine. Rear Admiral Matthias Gardner made Saratoga his flagship on 10 October. Four days later, the ship was accidentally rammed by her plane guard destroyer , <b>gashing</b> the port side of her hull. Operations were immediately cancelled and she returned to port for temporary repairs. Permanent repairs were made during a brief refit {{during the first week}} of November. Carrier qualification and other training continued through most of January 1945.|$|E
5|$|Tired of the {{constant}} violence, Stuart quit hockey after the Stanley Cup championship in 1907 and joined his father in construction. As part of this job, Stuart was sent to Belleville, Ontario, to oversee {{the building of the}} Belleville Drill Shed, one of his father's contracts. While in Belleville, he continued to receive offers to join a new hockey team. He was asked if he wanted to manage the Belleville team; a similar offer came from Peterborough, Ontario, while a town outside Toronto was said to have offered a railroad president's salary if Stuart would join them. On the afternoon of June 23, 1907, Stuart went to the Bay of Quinte, near Belleville, to swim with some friends. Stuart swam to the nearby lighthouse, about half a kilometre away from his group, climbed onto a platform and dived into the shallow water. He dived head first onto jagged rocks, <b>gashing</b> his head and breaking his neck. He was killed instantly. His body was brought back to Ottawa, where a service was held at his family's home before he was buried at Beechwood Cemetery.|$|E

25|$|The process uses a {{milling cutter}} with a {{cross-section}} that is slightly smaller than the final cross-section of the cut; {{it has the same}} diameter as the worm. The cutter is then angled to the <b>gashing</b> angle. The <b>gashing</b> angle is calculated from the lead and pitch diameter of the worm; often tables are available with the <b>gashing</b> angles for common diameters and leads. The cutter is centered over the blank and then plunged into it to the proper depth. The cutter is finally withdrawn and the blank indexed to the next tooth space and cut. This is repeated until all of the tooth spaces have been cut.|$|E
25|$|The {{process is}} similar to that {{outlined}} for the universal milling machine except a <b>gashing</b> angle is not used. When <b>gashing</b> spur gears, racks, or bevel gears the cutter is plunged into the workpiece and then moved linearly in the proper direction. If a helical gear is being roughed out, then the table rotates and moves along the vertical axis to interpolate the helical path.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gashing</b> is a {{machining}} process used {{to rough out}} coarse pitched gears and sprockets. It is commonly used on worm wheels before hobbing, but also used on internal and external spur gears, bevel gears, helical gears, and gear racks. The process is performed on gashers or universal milling machines, {{especially in the case}} of worm wheels. After <b>gashing</b> the gear or sprocket is finished via hobbing, shaping, or shaving.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of using sigmoidal tension <b>gashes</b> as strain markers for assessing strain localisation in shear zones is discussed. The appropriate analytical methods {{for this purpose}} depend on the assumed mechanism of tension <b>gash</b> formation. Two such models are considered. The first {{is one in which}} the curvature of the <b>gash</b> is produced by passive rotation of different segments of the <b>gash</b> in response shear strain gradients across the shear zone. The other model is one in which the curvature of the <b>gashes</b> is governed by the folding of the competent rock bridges between adjacent <b>gashes.</b> In the latter case, the tension <b>gashes</b> progressively grow within spaces created by the buckling bridges and therefore lead to a bulk dilatation of the shear zone. However, for the folded bridge mechanism to continue to operate beyond shear strains greater than unity requires a significant volume loss which in turn may signal the increase of the shear strength of the zone. The geometrical characteristics of <b>gash</b> arrays resulting from these two mechanisms are described and criteria given for the recognition of the two types of <b>gash</b> arrays. A new graphical method is proposed for the analysis of deformation in shear zones containing folded-bridge tension <b>gashes.</b> Tension <b>gash</b> arrays from Marloes, West Wales are used as examples of the procedures for shear zone analysis...|$|R
