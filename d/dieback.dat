5|$|A recent threat, first {{reported}} in 1978, is forest <b>dieback.</b> In some areas, {{especially in the}} peripheral region, this has been severe with nearly a 50% in vegetation. Water deficiency has been attributed as {{the main cause of}} <b>dieback</b> as droughts are becoming more frequent. Regrowth of forest is hindered by frost which is increasingly severe. The forest <b>dieback</b> has affected 22 species of plants with Calophyllum walkeri being the most affected. A study has suggested that low calcium causes soil acidification and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as aluminium may be causing the <b>dieback.</b> Leaching of nutrients and the resulting imbalance in soil micronutrients may also be contributing to the <b>dieback.</b>|$|E
5|$|B. sceptrum {{has been}} shown to be highly {{susceptible}} to <b>dieback</b> from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike many Western Australian banksias.|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos obovatus {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to <b>dieback</b> {{caused by the}} water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi. Specimens in coastal dune vegetation were reported killed by the fungus Armillaria luteobubalina, with mycelial sheaths of the fungus beneath the bark of the root collar.|$|E
5000|$|Drought and {{temperature}} have been causal factors in many <b>diebacks.</b> This condition {{is common in}} semi-arid regions and the trees are already stressed by dehydration. There have been reported <b>diebacks</b> in the 50% mortality range across multiple species in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South and Central America, and Australia. Notable drought related <b>diebacks</b> have occurred globally from the 1970s through the 2000s. A few drought related <b>diebacks</b> have occurred before this. For instance, a 23% mortality rate was reported between 1945 and 1993 in Senegal Africa. [...] Trees stressed by drought {{and temperature}} {{are more susceptible to}} parasites.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{threatened}} by use of its habitat for pine plantations, clearing of land, and <b>diebacks</b> that {{may be caused by}} drought. It is also susceptible to introgression with commoner species ...|$|R
50|$|Fever {{trees are}} fast growing and short lived. They have a {{tendency}} to occur as single-aged stands, and are subject to stand-level <b>diebacks</b> that have been variously attributed to elephants, water tables, and synchronous senescence.|$|R
5|$|Extremely {{sensitive}} to <b>dieback</b> caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi, Banksia coccinea is an indicator species {{for the presence}} of the disease. There is no known means of eradicating <b>dieback.</b> Much of the Stirling Range National Park is infested, though Fitzgerald River National Park has been largely spared. Applying phosphite to infested areas has been shown to reduce the mortality rates to around 50%. B. coccinea has shown some symptoms of toxicity to application of phosphite, with some patchy necrosis of leaves, but the plant's uptake of the compound is somewhat lower compared with uptake by other shrub species. Unusually, the symptoms {{do not appear to be}} proportional to exposure levels.|$|E
5|$|Highly {{valued by}} Australia's horticultural and cut flower industries, B.brownii is widely {{cultivated}} in areas {{not exposed to}} <b>dieback.</b> It prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage, and must be provided with some moisture over summer.|$|E
5|$|The main {{obstacle}} to cultivation is the species' extreme sensitivity to <b>dieback,</b> which is widespread in suburban gardens. However, the species {{has been successfully}} grafted onto a rootstock of B.integrifolia (coast banksia), which renders it hardy {{on a range of}} soils.|$|E
5000|$|When young {{cranberry}} shoots become infected, {{they show}} “tip blight” symptoms: shoot tips shrivel and a tan discoloration spreads {{from the tip}} of the shoot down the stem and into leaves. Cottonball tip blight differs from other shoot <b>diebacks,</b> in that tan V- or U-shaped lesions can be observed centered on the leaf midvein. Also, white, powdery conidia (asexual spores) appear on diseased shoots just before and during bloom. Tip blight of cottonball is often inconspicuous and is easily overlooked.|$|R
5000|$|Irruptive growth, {{sometimes}} called Malthusian growth, is a growth pattern over time, defined by population explosions and subsequent sharp population crashes, or <b>diebacks.</b> It {{is an extension}} of the Malthusian growth model, specifically the growth pattern that causes a Malthusian catastrophe, and can occur when populations overshoot their carrying capacity, a phenomenon typically associated with r-strategists. Populations which exhibit irruptive growth do not stabilize around their carrying capacity, a feature of logistic growth. Irruptive growth occurs when a species reproduces more rapidly than the environment is capable of supporting with the available resources. [...] Irruptive growth is studied in population ecology.|$|R
40|$|Field surveys for ascertaining the {{sanitary}} {{status of}} hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) orchards {{located in the}} provinces of Catania and Messina, Sicily, were car-ried out. Twig and branch <b>diebacks</b> were frequently observed on the local hazelnut cultivars. Identification of the bacterial pathogen associated with these symp-toms was performed by means of biochemical, patho-genicity and molecular tests {{as well as by}} using fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphic (fAFLP) analysis. The study revealed, for the first time, the presence of Pseudomonas syringae pv. coryli in the Sicilian hazelnut orchards. All the strains obtained did not show the presence of syrB gene. The fAFLP analysis pointed out the presence of three different lineages within the strains of this pathogen...|$|R
5|$|A {{trial in}} Western Australia showed Banksia marginata to be mildly {{sensitive}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi <b>dieback.</b> At Brisbane Ranges National Park west of Melbourne, which was invaded by Phytophthora cinnamomi in the 1970s, Banksia marginata (along with such species as Grevillea steiglitziana) {{was part of}} a secondary regrowth of understory species after more resistant shrubs such as grasses and sedges had grown back.|$|E
5|$|B. verticillata is {{significantly}} threatened {{by at least}} three microorganisms. Several populations have reduced or vanished from <b>dieback</b> (Phytophthora cinnamomi), such as those at Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve and Gull Rock National Park. The honey fungus Armillaria luteobubalina has killed plants in Torndirrup National Park, and aerial canker (Zythiostroma) has decimated populations at Waychinicup National Park east of Albany.|$|E
5|$|B.spinulosa {{does not}} appear to be under threat. It is {{resistant}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi <b>dieback,</b> which poses a major threat to many other Banksia species; and its wide distribution protects against the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing. As a result, it {{does not appear}} on the list of threatened Australian plants under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E
40|$|Lake Ontario, as {{many other}} lakes in the world, has {{suffered}} {{from a variety of}} environmental problems over the past fifty years. Massive blooms followed by die-backs of Cladophora, a filamentous algae, and by <b>diebacks</b> of the alewife, a fish, fouled beaches along the Lake Ontario shoreline in the 1960 s. The phosphorus abatement program, agreed to by both Canada and the United States, successfully reduced the levels of phosphorus that stimulated the growth of algae. As a result of the reduction of phosphorus, once commonly found in detergents and sewage plant effluent, algae populations including the once ubiquitous shoreline Cladophora species were reduced by the late 1980 s.

50|$|The {{story is}} written from two viewpoints, {{equidistant}} from the novel's publication in 1980. The first thread {{is set in}} a 1998 ravaged by ecological disasters such as algal blooms and <b>diebacks</b> on the brink of large scale extinctions. Various other events are mentioned in passing, such as student riots and an event of nuclear terrorism against New York City which took place before the events of the novel. This thread follows a group of scientists in the United Kingdom connected with the University of Cambridge and their attempts to warn the past of the impending disaster by sending tachyon-induced messages to the astronomical position the Earth occupied in 1962-1963. Given the faster-than-light nature of the tachyon, these messages will effectively reach the past. These efforts are led by John Renfrew, an Englishman, and Gregory Markham, an American most likely modeled on Benford himself.|$|R
40|$|We present six tree-ring chronologies from Mount Emei and Xinglong Mountain, central China, {{which were}} used to study tree growth {{in the context of}} local climate {{variations}} and to provide insight into the regional response of tree growth to climatic and environmental change. The intra- and inter-site running correlations between tree-ring series may be related to shifts in environmental stress. Persistently declining drought response of tree growth at Mount Emei {{may be related to the}} moss-induced "swamping effect". <b>Diebacks</b> at Mount Emei at ~ 1974 may have been caused by sharply elevated levels of pollutants from a forest fire in 1972. Tree growth at the two lower sites at Xinglong Mountain shows positive correlations with moisture during a water-year, while a negative drought response is seen at the uppermost site. An increase in drought sensitivity of tree growth is observed under the persistent drying trend in recent decades at the Xinglong Mountain. © 2010 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|Banksia aculeata {{has been}} {{reported}} as susceptible to <b>dieback</b> from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, but in a 2008 study this pathogen {{was found to have}} no direct impact on the species. As a result of this finding, together with the low percentage of populations infested or facing imminent infestation, the species was classed as having a very low extinction risk.|$|E
5|$|Banksia lemanniana {{has been}} shown to have a low to {{moderate}} susceptibility to <b>dieback</b> from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike many Western Australian banksias. A study on cultivated plants in South Australia inoculated with P.cinnamomi and P.citricola found B.lemanniana to have an overall low susceptibility overall to both organisms, although 2-to-3-week-old seedlings appeared more vulnerable than 10-month-old ones.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata {{has shown}} a {{variable}} susceptibility to <b>dieback</b> from the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, the plants in sandier soils showing more resistance than those in heavier soils. Plants from Wilsons Promontory were sensitive. The resistance of plants from Flinders Island is unknown. The small size of the stand renders it vulnerable to eradication.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally the {{registration}} of seasonal changes in plant {{growth and development}} {{has been carried out}} phenologically, i. e., qualitatively using visual inspection. However, since the process of plant acclimatization to winter dormancy involves reversible biochemical and physiological changes at the level of cells, quantitative methods can be applied to determine the duration and the depth of winter dormancy in perennial plants. We used a method based on detecting thermally induced changes in the zero-level fluorescence (TICZF) on needles from four Siberian coniferous trees. Needles of Picea obovata Ledeb. and Abies sibirica Ledeb. recover from the state of winter dormancy much faster than those of Pinus sibirica Du Tour and Pinus sylvestris L. The photosynthetic apparatus in the needles of A. sibirica may be damaged during the spring period, characterized by unstable weather, when after several days of warm weather, the plants prematurely recover from winter dormancy. We conclude that under conditions of climate warming tree, species like A. sibirica may suffer from severe <b>diebacks</b> due to desiccation caused by premature break of winter dormancy...|$|R
40|$|Poplar and willow {{plantations}} {{have become}} widespread in China, {{in order to}} meet national economic and environmental needs. The emergence of several pathogens is enhanced by climatic change and associated human factors. Species of Cytospora are well-known pathogens on poplar and willow, and cause stem cankers and <b>diebacks.</b> In the present study, we conducted a survey of Cytospora species occurring on Populus spp. and Salix spp. in China. We used morphological examination and phylogenetic inferences, based on the DNA sequence data from the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS 1, 5. 8 S rDNA, and ITS 2) and partial β-tubulin gene, to identify six Cytospora species occurring on poplar and willow. Five of these species belonged to known taxa, viz. Cytospora chrysosperma (asexual state of Valsa sordida), Cytospora translucens (asexual state of Leucostoma translucens), Cytospora fugax (asexual state of Valsa salicina), Cytospora atrocirrhata, and Cytospora kantschavelii. Our study yielded a new species, Cytospora davidiana sp. nov., on poplar. The new species is characterized by typical torsellioid conidiomata. An additional Cytospora sp. 1, which formed a distinct clade in the phylogenetic inferences, remains unnamed; the paucity of available materials prevented phenotypical characterization. © 2015 The British Mycological Society...|$|R
40|$|Global average {{temperature}} has increased and precipitation pattern has altered {{over the past}} 100 years due to increases in greenhouse gases. These changes will alter numerous site factors and biochemical processes of vegetative communities such as nutrient and water availability, permafrost thawing, fire regime, biotic interactions and invasion. As a consequence, climate change is expected to alter distribution ranges of many species and communities as well as boundaries of biomes. Shifting of species and vegetation zones northwards and upwards in elevation has already been observed. Besides, several experiments have been conducted and simulations have been run {{all over the world}} in order to predict possible range shifts and ecological risks. In this paper, we review literature available in Web of Science on Europe and boreal Eurasia and give an overview of observed and predicted changes in vegetation in these regions. The main trends include advance of the tree line, reduction of the alpine vegetation belt, drought risk, forest <b>diebacks,</b> a shift from coniferous forests to deciduous forests and invasion. It is still controversial if species migration will be able to keep pace with climate change...|$|R
5|$|Banksia speciosa is {{extremely}} sensitive to <b>dieback</b> caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi and numbers in Cape Le Grand and Cape Arid National Parks have been drastically reduced as whole populations of plants have perished after exposure. It is an indicator species {{for the presence}} of the disease. Nursery plants in Italy perished from root and basal stem rot from the pathogen Phytophthora taxon niederhauserii.|$|E
5|$|Both {{plant and}} animal life endemic to snow-bound areas develop ways to adapt. Among the {{adaptive}} mechanisms for plants are dormancy, seasonal <b>dieback,</b> survival of seeds; and for animals are hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat.|$|E
5|$|Inoculation {{experiments}} {{show that}} Lambertia formosa is resistant to <b>dieback</b> (Phytophthora cinnamomi), unlike all {{other members of}} the genus.

40|$|A cross-ecosystem {{comparison}} of {{data obtained from}} 92 coastal zone ecosystems worldwide revealed a strong positive response of marine phytoplankton biomass to nutrient enrichment that is highly consistent with the general patterns reported previously in the limnological literature for freshwater lakes and reservoirs. Average concentrations of chlorophyll a in estuarine and coastal marine systems were strongly dependent on the mean concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the water column. Moreover, as is true of freshwater ecosystems, {{the identity of the}} primary growth-limiting nutrient for marine phytoplankton appeared to be generally predictable from watercolumn total nitrogen: total phosphorus (TN: TP) ratios. This similarity in physiological response to nutrients likely derives from the shared evolutionary histories of marine and freshwater phytoplankton. Much of our current knowledge of eutrophication is derived from research on lake systems in North America and Europe, which {{led to the development of}} the predictive frameworks now used worldwide in freshwater management (Smith 1998). However, it is clear that, in many nutrientsensitive coastal marine waters, eutrophication can cause increased rates of primary productivity, changes in algal and vascular plant biomass, shifts in algal and vascular plant species composition, <b>diebacks</b> of sea grasses and corals, reduced populations of fish and shellfish, reductions in transparency, losses of acceptable aquatic habitats and biodiversity, and oxygen depletion in bottom waters (National Research Council 2000). Coastal marine environmental quality is thus an issue of major global concern (United Nations Environmen...|$|R
5000|$|The whitebark {{forests of}} the Rockies {{are not the only}} forests that have been {{affected}} by the mountain pine beetle. Due to temperature changes and wind patterns, the pine beetle has now spread through the Continental Divide of the Rockies and has invaded the fragile boreal forests of Alberta, known as the “lungs of the Earth”. These forests are imperative for producing oxygen through photosynthesis and removing carbon in the atmosphere. But as the forests become infested and die, carbon dioxide is released into the environment, and contributes even more to a warming climate. Ecosystems and humans rely on the supply of oxygen in the environment, and threats to this boreal forest results in severe consequences to our planet and human health. In a forest ravaged by pine beetle, the dead logs and kindle which can easily be ignited by lightning. Forest fires present dangers to the environment, human health and the economy. [...] They are detrimental to air quality and vegetation, releasing toxic and carcinogenic compounds as they burn. Due to human induced deforestation and climate change, along with the pine beetle pandemic, the strength of forest ecosystems decrease. The infestations and resulting diseases can indirectly, but seriously, effect human health. As droughts and temperature increases continue, so does the frequency of devastating forest fires, insect infestations, forest <b>diebacks,</b> acid rain, habitat loss, animal endangerment and threats to safe drinking water.|$|R
50|$|The year is ca. 2295, almost {{fifteen years}} after the last episode. There are seven {{distinct}} groups of humans (most scientific, some religious) on the planets of the Murasaki system, but only four children have been born here during the past 30 years. Without apparent reason the carpet whales, who normally graze in the polar waters of Genji's Starside, start swimming towards Moonside, converging towards the point where Chujo is exactly overhead. The Holdens alert the other humans {{to the fact that}} the carpet whales are projecting an image of Kammer into the atmosphere. At the sub-Genji node on the sister planet, the huge living mats (now known to consist of microorganisms related to those that caused the plague) again form bioloons, but this time they transport Chupchups to Genji, guided by bioluminescent signals from the carpet whales. At the same time, all Ihrdizu interrupt whatever activity they are engaged in, and gain access to knowledge that was previously blocked. On Chujo, the aloof Chupchups suddenly seek contact with the humans and present records revealing that all these events are part of a genetically encoded cycle of evolution that knits together all three sapient races in the Murasaki system: the Chupchups bioengineer the Genjian ecology but every time they cause an environmental disaster which results in <b>diebacks</b> and in the breakdown of the Ihrdizu civilization; the carpet whales exile the Chupchups to Chujo so that they can improve their bioengineering, and call them back when the cycle can be started again. The Chupchups' attempt to return to Genji 28 years earlier failed because the Ihrdizu had killed so many carpet whales that no proper guiding signals could be produced.|$|R

40|$|A recent global {{review on}} {{the impacts of}} climate change on {{mangroves}} concluded that different regions will experience varying degrees of impacts due to the variability of expected changes in climate (shifts in precipitation, frequency and intensity of storms, droughts, sea level rise, change of ocean currents, increases in CO 2 concentrations, etc.) and the variety of types and mangrove assemblages growing in these regions, including different species composition of mangrove forests. In North America and the Caribbean, these changes are dependent upon a predicted higher frequency (and intensity) of tropical storms, sea level rise, changes in patterns of precipitation, and higher temperatures. Located at the land-sea interface, mangroves in this region are expected to expand their ranges poleward (towards North Florida), or migrate into other coastal ecosystems (e. g., the Everglades), provided no natural or urban center barriers are present to prevent this expansion. If rains increase, as is anticipated, along the United States-Mexico border, mangroves may likely begin to thrive in places currently occupied by unvegetated salt flats. However, a lack of rain may also be of benefit {{in areas such as}} Louisiana where marsh <b>diebacks</b> have been linked to droughts, which directly increases the likelihood of mangrove migrations into these ecosystems. Given the services that mangroves provide and the legal protections that mangroves receive, it is shocking to discover that their future existence may be compromised or threatened. Certainly, the greatest threats to mangroves in Florida are from direct and indirect human impacts of development, including pollution and habitat destruction. Mangroves may also be naturally damaged and destroyed from disturbance events such as tropical storms and hurricanes. However, a new threat to native mangroves has recently emerged: the introduction of invasive mangrove species. These non-native species may threaten the ecosystem dynamics of mangrove forests and may alter the natural coastal landscape of South Florida unless eradicated...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{observations}} and model simulations have highlighted {{the sensitivity of}} the forest - tundra ecotone to climatic forcing. In contrast, paleoecological studies have not provided evidence of tree-line fluctuations in response to Holocene climatic changes in Alaska, suggesting that the forest - tundra boundary in certain areas may be relatively stable at multicentennial to millennial time scales. We conducted a multiproxy study of sediment cores from an Alaskan lake near the altitudinal limits of key boreal-forest species. Paleoecological data were compared with independent climatic reconstructions to assess ecosystem responses of the forest - tundra boundary to Little Ice Age (LIA) climatic. uctuations. Pollen, diatom, charcoal, macrofossil, and magnetic analyses provide the first continuous record of vegetation -. re - climate interactions at decadal to centennial time scales during the past 700 years from southern Alaska. Boreal-forest <b>diebacks</b> characterized by declines of Picea mariana, P. glauca, and tree Betula occurred during the LIA (AD 1500 - 1800), whereas shrubs (Alnus viridis, Betula glandulosa/nana) and herbaceous taxa (Epilobium, Aconitum) expanded. Marked increases in charcoal abundance and changes in magnetic properties suggest increases in. re importance and soil erosion during the same period. In addition, the conspicuous reduction or disappearance of certain aquatic (e. g., Isoetes, Nuphar, Pediastrum) and wetland (Sphagnum) plants and major shifts in diatom assemblages suggest pronounced lake-level. uctuations and rapid ecosystem reorganization in response to LIA climatic deterioration. Our results imply that temperature shifts of 1 - 2 degrees C, when accompanied by major changes in moisture balance, can greatly alter high-altitudinal terrestrial, wetland, and aquatic ecosystems, including conversion between boreal-forest tree line and tundra. The climatic and ecosystem variations in our study area appear to be coherent with changes in solar irradiance, suggesting that changes in solar activity contributed to the environmental instability of the past 700 years...|$|R
40|$|Forest fires play a {{key role}} in the global carbon cycle and thus, can affect {{regional}} and global climate. Although fires in extended areas of Russian boreal forests have a considerable influence on atmospheric greenhouse gas and soot concentrations, estimates of their impact on climate are hampered by a lack of data on the history of forest fires. Especially regions with strong continental climate are of high importance due to an intensified development of wildfires. In this study we reconstruct the fire history of Southern Siberia during the past 750 years using ice-core based nitrate, potassium, and charcoal concentration records from Belukha glacier in the continental Siberian Altai. A period of exceptionally high forest-fire activity was observed between AD 1600 and 1680, following an extremely dry period AD 1540 - 1600. Ice-core pollen data suggest distinct forest <b>diebacks</b> and the expansion of steppe in response to dry climatic conditions. Coherence with a paleoenvironmental record from the 200  km distant Siberian lake Teletskoye shows that the vegetational shift AD 1540 - 1680, the increase in fire activity AD 1600 - 1680, and the subsequent recovery of forests AD 1700 were of regional significance. Dead biomass accumulation in response to drought and high temperatures around AD 1600 probably triggered maximum forest-fire activity AD 1600 - 1680. The extreme dry period in the 16 th century was also observed at other sites in Central Asia and is possibly associated with a persistent positive mode of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). No significant increase in biomass burning occurred in the Altai region during the last 300 years, despite strongly increasing temperatures and human activities. Our results imply that precipitation changes controlled fire-regime and vegetation shifts in the Altai region during the past 750 years. We conclude that high sensitivity of ecosystems to occasional decadal-scale drought events may trigger unprecedented environmental reorganizations under global-warming conditions...|$|R
