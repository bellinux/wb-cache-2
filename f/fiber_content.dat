They contain antioxidants such as falcarinol, falcarindiol, panaxydiol, and methyl-falcarindiol, which may potentially have anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The dietary fiber in parsnips is partly of the soluble and partly the insoluble type and comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The high <b>fiber</b> <b>content</b> of parsnips {{may help prevent}} constipation and reduce blood cholesterol levels.|$|E
5|$|A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers {{grasses and}} tender reed shoots with high protein and low <b>fiber</b> <b>content.</b> This reedbuck is {{dependent}} on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. The social structure of the bohor reedbuck is highly flexible. Large aggregations are observed during the dry season, when hundreds of bohor reedbuck assemble near a river. Males become sexually mature {{at the age of}} three to four years, while females can conceive at just one year of age, reproducing every nine to fourteen months. Though there is no fixed breeding season, mating peaks in the rainy season. The gestation period is seven and a half months long, after which a single calf is born. The calves are weaned at eight to nine months of age.|$|E

40|$|Methods for {{estimation}} of grow index of tealeaves based on Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function: BRDF measurements with ground based network cameras is proposed. Due to {{a fact that}} Near Infrared: NIR camera data is proportional to total nitrogen while that shows negative correlation to <b>fiber</b> <b>contents,</b> {{it is possible to}} estimate nitrogen and <b>fiber</b> <b>contents</b> in tealeaves with ground based NIR camera data and remote sensing satellite data. Through regressive analysis between measured total nitrogen and <b>fiber</b> <b>contents</b> and NIR reflectance of tealeaves in tea estates, it is found that there is a good correlation between both then regressive equations are created. Also it is found that monitoring of a grow index of tealeaves with BRDF measured with networks cameras is valid.

5|$|A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers {{grasses and}} tender reed shoots with high protein and low <b>fiber</b> <b>content.</b> This reedbuck is {{dependent}} on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. A study of the bohor reedbuck's diet in Rwenzori Mountains National Park (Uganda) revealed that, throughout the year, the most preferred species was Sporobolus consimilis. Other grasses the animals fed on included Hyparrhenia filipendula, Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, {{all of which are}} species commonly found in heavily grazed grasslands. Bohor reedbuck preferred Cynodon dactylon and Cenchrus ciliaris in the wet season, and switched to Sporobolus pyramidalis and Panicum repens in the dry season. Though they rarely feed on dicots, these can include Capparis and Sida species. On regularly burnt pastures, the bohor reedbuck feeds on Imperata species, while in places close by water sources, it eats Leersia and newly sprouted Vossia species (like topi and puku).|$|E

Roasting does not alter the amount of caffeine in the bean, but does give less caffeine when the beans are measured by volume because the beans expand during roasting.|$|E

Primary test results show that, the unit water consumption of mixture was increased with the dosage of PVA fibers, but the slump of concrete mixture was decreased. Experimental results show that, the compressive strength and splitting tensile strength are increased very quickly at the early ages (before the age of 28 days). The compressive strength of concrete is decreased with the increasing of <b>fibers</b> <b>content,</b> but the splitting tensile strength of concrete is increased with the increasing of <b>fibers</b> <b>content.</b> The elastic modulus of concrete was decreased with the dosage of PVA fiber, but the limit tensile strain was increased with the dosage of PVA fiber...|$|R

25|$|Minerals such as titanium, iron, and {{zirconium}} {{are commonly}} found in the soil and they, too, {{become part of the}} comb walls. The average dry weight of the nest is about 80.87 g. Cells in the paper comb are typically 4 to 5mm long and 8 to 9mm in diameter. Exact composition of nests in northern Turkey contained oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen as the main elements, while elements found in trace amounts were silicon, calcium, iron, and potassium, but no aluminum, magnesium, or sodium were detected, providing further evidence that European hornets use the surrounding soil as a resource in building their nests. The ratio of fibrous material to actual saliva affects the nest's ability to absorb water, thus how well the inside of the nest stays dry. In these same nests studied in Turkey, <b>fiber</b> <b>content</b> was 23% while 77% was hornet saliva. Just for these nests, the resulting water absorption capacity turned out to be optimal: 100%.|$|E
30|$|To obtain fibrous webs {{with the}} high thermal {{resistance}} and reasonable mechanical strength, blend webs with PS and PA 6 contents were produced by the multi-jet electrospinning process. Confocal microscopy {{can be used to}} examine <b>fiber</b> <b>contents</b> and distribution in the web, while immersion test gave more accurate <b>fiber</b> <b>contents</b> of the blend web. Fiber morphology and 3 D structure of PS fibrous web were influenced by the environmental humidity during electrospinning process and solvent selection. PS web produced in higher humidity generated more pores and corrugations at the surface. The increased surface roughness and porosity led to the increased hydrophobicity and thermal resistance.|$|R
