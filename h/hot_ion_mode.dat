40|$|Ignition {{criteria}} and fusion power density are calculated for catalyzed-D and D- 3 He plasmas for <b>hot</b> <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> (T 1 > T,) operation facilitated {{by a large}} ratio of the ion energy confinement time to the electron energy confinement time. The optimistic case of complete transfer of {{the energy of the}} charged-particle fusion products to the ions is considered; this case further enhances <b>hot</b> <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> operation. Even though <b>hot</b> <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> operation increases the fusion power density, the maximum pressure-limited fusion power densities in catalyzed-D and D- 3 He are at least a factor of thirty times lower than those in D-T plasmas; as a result the achievement of very high plasma beta and/or the maximum use of high field magnet technology are needed in order to attain high wall loadings and moderate thermal output power levels in D-D and D- 3 He reactors. The implications of ignition requirements on machine design are determined for tokamak plasmas; the electron energy confinement time is assumed to be given by an empirical energy scaling law,-r, ~ na 2. The thermal stability of advanced fuel plasmas is studied. It is found that the runaway time is short compared to the energy confinement time for ion temperatures that maximize fusion power of a pressure limited plasma. I...|$|E

Transmission system for the central-cell ECH, including a taper, mirrors and polarizers, has been designed and installed for efficient direct bulk electron heating. ECH system with a twister and a circular polarizer for central-cell region has the advantages for controllable polarization of incident wave. Recently, a high power gyrotron of ~ 500 kW at 28 GHz has been developed in collaboration with Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) and this high power gyrotron was installed in central-cell region of GAMMA 10. This high power and efficient ECH system was applied to centralcell electron heating and significant increment of soft Xray and diamagnetism signals during a pulse of ECH operation was obtained.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{changing}} beam and plasma {{species on the}} edge transport barrier are investigated for ELM-free <b>hot</b> <b>ion</b> H <b>mode</b> discharges from the recent DT experiments on JET. The measured pressure {{at the top of}} the pedestal is higher for mixed deuterium and tritium and pure tritium plasmas over and above the level measured in pure deuterium plasmas at the same heating power. The pedestal pressure increases with beam tritium concentration for mixed deuterium-tritium beam injection into deuterium plasmas where the measured edge tritium concentration remains low. Alpha heating plays a significant role in the core of such plasmas, and the possible impact on the edge is discussed together with possible direct isotopic effects. Heuristic models for the transport barrier width are proposed, and used to explore a wider range of edge measurements including full power DD and DT pulses. This analysis supports the plasma current and mass dependence for a barrier width set by the orbit loss of either thermal or fast ions, though it does not unambiguously distinguish between them. The fast ion hypothesis could well account for some of the JET observations, though more theoretical work and direct experimental measurement would be required to confirm this. An ad hoc model for the power loss through the separatrix, P(loss) proportional-to-n(edge) (2) Z(eff,edge) I(p) (- 1), is proposed based on neoclassical theory, a ballooning limit to the edge gradient and a barrier width set by the poloidal ion gyroradius. Such a model is compared with experimental data from JET. In particular, the model ascribes the systematic difference in loss power between the Mark I and Mark II diverters to the change in the measured Z(eff). This change in Z(eff) is consistent with the observed change in impurity production, which is described in some detail, together with a possible explanation provided by the temperature dependence of chemical sputtering...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the more}} ambitious uses of intense {{microwaves}} in tokamaks or in other magnetic confinement deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion devices would be to divert power from energetic alpha-particles to waves.

The parabolic type ITB has the reduced thermal diusivity,, in the core region; however, the E r shear, dE r =dr, is not so strong.

40|$|Co-injection (DO [...] > D+) {{applied to}} TEXTOR {{leads to a}} hot ion node regime with {{enhanced}} confinement. A synergistic increase of the beam effects is observed {{with the addition of}} ICRH at omega = 2 omega(cD) = omega(cH) (H minority heating scenario) resulting, beside other reviewed effects, in a significant increase of the ion temperature and of the beam driven current (respectively larger than 30 % and 50 % for the addition of an RF power comparable to the NBI one). The large ion heating efficiency of ICRH also remains when ICRH is added to balanced injection and the <b>hot</b> <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> regime remains up to the maximum achieved beta (= 2 / 3 of the Troyan limit with more than 6 MW of auxiliary heating). ICRH also leads to the formation of a more &# 039;isotropic&# 039; tail. These results are interpreted {{with the help of a}} Fokker-Planck code which computes the beam distribution function in presence of RF and of TRANSP simulations. The amount of RF absorption by the H minority by the ion beam and die bulk plasma is theoretically evaluated. It is shown that a large part of the synergistic effects can be explained by the rise of the electron temperature due to the minority heating which increases the beam slowing down time and its critical energy. A smaller contribution to the effects is due to direct coupling of the RF power to the beam (less than 10 % of the total RF absorbed power) and to the decrease of the plasma toroidal rotation induced by the RF. ICRH has also been added to co-injection at omega = 3 omega(CD). In this case no minority heating is present and the RF energy coupling to the beam is one of the dominant effects. It leads to the formation of a very energetic tail of the ion beam with a strong increase of the beam-target neutron reactivity...|$|E

30|$|The {{possibility}} {{to make a}} mass spectrum at a lower mass range was important to observe {{the presence of other}} radiolysis products, as the one derived from decarboxylation process (2 A). The decarboxylation product 3 -methylbutylammine (2 A) is the precursor of the product observed as the ion m/z 101, corresponding to 1 -amino- 3 -methylbut- 1 -enylamine (2 B). It results from the reaction of 2 A ammine with an ammonia radical. Besides the dual ESI ion polarity (positive and negative) mode provided several important indications. The mass spectrum in negative <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> showed the presence of other radiolysis products, first of all the product of deamination (2 E). Some of the ions in negative <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> were also present if the spectrum was recorded in positive <b>ion</b> <b>mode,</b> as positive <b>ion.</b> It is plausible to suppose that if a product is visible both in negative and positive <b>ion</b> <b>mode,</b> the amino and carboxylic groups are kept in the radiation product.

However, direct (i. e., with no previous separation of lipid classes) analysis of crude extracts containing a complex mixture of lipids (a problem typically encountered in shotgun lipidomics) is still a quite challenging task using a conventional MALDI matrix such as 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB).

As expected, ESI of unfolded lysozyme leads to the formation of substantially higher charge states than the tightly folded protein in both modes of operation. Surprisingly, the acid-induced unfolding of cyt c as well as the acid and the base-induced unfolding of ubiquitin show different behavior: In these three cases protein unfolding only leads to marginal changes in the negative ion charge state distributions, whereas in the positive <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> pronounced shifts to higher charge states are observed. This shows that ESI MS in the negative <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> as a method for probing conformational changes of proteins in solution should be treated with caution. The data presented in this work provide further evidence that the conformation of a protein in solution not its charge state is the predominant factor for determining the ESI charge state distribution in the positive <b>ion</b> <b>mode.</b> Furthermore, these data support the hypothesis of a recent study (Konermann and Douglas, Biochemistry 1997, 36, 12296 – 12302) which suggested that ESI in the positive <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> is not sensitive to changes in the secondary structure of proteins but only to changes in the tertiary structure...|$|R

MALDI-MS analysis of small organic compounds (< 1000 Da) is typically complex due to interferences from numerous cluster ions formed when using conventional matrices. To expand {{the use of}} MALDI {{for the analysis of}} small molecules,, novel matrices were designed by covalently linking conventional matrices (or a lysine moiety) to detonated NDs.

Using both linear theory (WHAMP) and two-dimensional electrostatic simulations, {{we show that}} ion shell distributions can cause unstable <b>ion</b> Bernstein <b>mode</b> emissions with high temporal growth rates, as well as perpendicular and parallel e-folding distances, that are {{in accordance with the}} tranverse dimensions of auroral arcs and the parallel size of the energisation region, respectively. The phase velocities of the waves are in the proper range to give parallel energisation to electrons with a Landau resonance. The simulation shows that about 90 % of the energy goes into electrons and 10 % goes into cold ion perpendicular heating. An electron heating rate of ~ 80 eV/s is obtained. Key words.

40|$|A battery-powered, controlled-current, two-electrode {{electrochemical}} cell containing a porous flow-through working electrode with high surface area and multiple auxiliary electrodes with small {{total surface area}} was incorporated into the electrospray emitter circuit to control the electrochemical reactions of analytes in the electrospray emitter. This cell system provided {{the ability to control}} the extent of analyte oxidation in positive <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> in the electrospray emitter by simply setting the magnitude and polarity of the current at the working electrode. In addition, this cell provided the ability to effectively reduce analytes in positive <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> and oxidize analytes in negative <b>ion</b> <b>mode.</b> The small size, economics, and ease of use of such a battery-powered controlled-current emitter cell was demonstrated by powering a single resistor and switch circuit with a small-size, 3 V watch battery, all of which might be incorporated on the emitter cell...|$|R
40|$|Phospholipids can be {{classified}} into glycerol- and sphingo-phospholipids and into classes based on their polar head groups. The major glycerophospholipid classes are phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine, phosphatylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinisitol (PI). In this study, total lipid and phospholipid extraction was performed according to the Bligh and Dyer method [1]. The extracts were analysed in {{both positive and negative}} <b>ion</b> <b>modes</b> ESI-MS for monitoring the present of intact phospholipids. Structural characterizations of each intact phospholipid were done in both positive and negative <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> by electrospray ionization tandem-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The MS/MS analyses of each protonated [M+H]+ and deprotonated [M-H]- molecule were performed at various different collision off set values in order to obtain the intense characteristic fragment ions in the MS/MS spectra. PC was identified in positive <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> for all extracts due to their fixed positive charged at the choline group [2, 3] PS was able to be detected in positive and negative <b>ion</b> <b>mode.</b> In the extracts protonated PS at m/z 790 was detected at with a prominent fragment ion m/z 605. The PS species observed at m/z 790 is assigned as PS (18 : 0, 18 : 1). In negative <b>ion</b> <b>mode</b> deprotonated singly charged ion and deprotonated doubly charged ion was observed at m/z 788. 5 and at 393. 8 respectively. PE, PI and plasmalogen-PE were also identified in the extracts. REFERENCES [1] Bligh EG, Dyer WJ. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.
