5|$|The Dalek Prime Minister {{explains}} {{that they have}} a planet known as the Asylum where they keep insane, battle-scarred Daleks. The Parliament has received a transmission of the Habanera Aria from the Asylum. The Doctor makes contact with the source of the transmission: the survivor of a starliner crash named Oswin Oswald. Oswin claims to have spent a year fending off Dalek attacks and making soufflés. The crash had ruptured the planet's force-field, thus risking escape of the insane Daleks. To prevent this, the Parliament wishes to destroy the planet remotely, but the force-field <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> strong to allow that. The Daleks task the Doctor, Amy and Rory with deactivating the force field from the planet. The three are given bracelets to protect them from the planet's nanogene cloud, which would convert them into Dalek puppets, before being dropped onto the planet.|$|E
25|$|The proper arsenic MCL {{continues}} to be debated. Some {{have argued that the}} 10 ppb federal standard <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> high, while others have argued that 10 ppb is needlessly strict. Individual states are able to establish lower arsenic limits; New Jersey has done so, setting a maximum of 0.005mg/L for arsenic in drinking water.|$|E
25|$|Between 2006 and 2014, {{the share}} of Brazilian {{researchers}} hosted by southeastern institutions dropped steadily from 50% to 44%. Over the same period, {{the share of}} northeastern states rose from 16% to 20%. It <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> early to see {{the effect of these}} changes on scientific output, or in the number of PhD degrees being awarded but these indicators should logically also progress.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> near the system against which he stood and his newspaper only numbered some twenty issues. The men who had played leading roles <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> powerful for such paper to be published with impunity and Année was forced to abandon it.|$|R

25|$|Socrates begins one of {{the most}} {{influential}} dialogues of Western philosophy regarding the argument for inborn knowledge. By drawing geometric figures in the ground Socrates demonstrates that the slave is initially unaware of the length that a side must be in order to double the area of a square with two-foot sides. The slave guesses first that the original side must be doubled in length (four feet), and when this proves too much, that it must be three feet. This <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> much, and the slave is at a loss.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, MSU {{accepted}} {{its first}} class of {{students for the}} Residential College in Arts & Humanities. Founded October 21, 2005, the college provides around 600 undergraduates with an individualized curriculum in the liberal, visual and performing arts. Though all the students will graduate with the same degree, MSU will encourage students in the college {{to get a second}} degree or specialization. The new college will be MSU's fourth residential college, after James Madison College, the Lyman Briggs School, and the now-defunct Justin Morrill College. Although early proposals named the college after Nelson Mandela, university officials have not decided on a permanent name , saying that it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> early to fix a permanent name to the college.|$|E
25|$|Subramanian {{also points}} out the {{limitation}} of book to explain the recent economic development in China and India. Under an authoritarian regime (theoretically extractive political institutions), China has achieved rapid economic development while democratic India (theoretically inclusive political institutions) has lagged much behind. According to Surbramanian, one can say that China and India are outliers or that it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> early to decide (that is, China might collapse and India might catch up according to the book's prediction). However, it is still unsatisfying that the theory is unable to explain the situation of 1/3 of the world's population, and {{it is unlikely that}} China or India will change drastically in the near future, according to the prediction.|$|E

25|$|The {{story begins}} {{when the family}} is about to leave Plum Creek, shortly after the family has {{recovered}} from the scarlet fever which caused Mary to become blind. The family welcomes a visit from Aunt Docia, whom they had not seen for several years. She suggests that Pa and Ma move west to the rapidly developing Dakota Territory, where Pa could work in Uncle Henry’s railroad camp at very good wages for that era. Ma and Pa agree, since it will allow Pa {{to look for a}} homestead while he works. The family has endured many hardships on Plum Creek and Pa especially is anxious for a new start. After selling his land and farm to neighbors, Pa goes ahead with the wagon and team. Mary <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> weak to travel so {{the rest of the family}} follows later by train.|$|E
25|$|Two Jewish men, Erik Weissman, and Raphael Teken, as well {{as their}} roommate Brendan Mess, were killed in a triple {{homicide}} in Waltham, Massachusetts, on September 11, 2011, the 10-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Each victim's throat had been slit with such great force as to be nearly decapitated. Thousands of dollars worth of marijuana and cash were left covering the victims' bodies, and $5,000 was left at the scene. The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other. It was reported on April 23, 2013, that local authorities believed Tsarnaev may have been responsible for the triple homicide, and they and the FBI were investigating the possibility. In May, forensic evidence connected the two brothers {{to the scene of the}} killings, and their cell phone records appeared to place them in the area. The officials cautioned that until more definitive DNA testing is complete, it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> early to consider bringing an indictment against the younger of the two brothers.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, William Houston of The Globe and Mail wrote, [...] "The best of {{the group}} is Soviet star winger Pavel Bure, a {{spectacular}} player with outstanding speed. He is compared to Vladimir Krutov and also the late Soviet superstar of the 1970s, Valeri Kharlamov." [...] NHL organizations were afraid he would not leave the Soviet Union {{to play in the}} NHL thus deterring teams from selecting him early, although scouts and analysts believed he could have been selected as high as the second round had he defected. Many analysts compared him to Valeri Khalarmov. Edmonton Oilers' scout Barry Fraser commented, [...] "From what I've seen of him, Bure can play on any team in the NHL right now... he's quick, real quick, small and very exciting. He may be the top player in this year's draft, but because he is from the Soviet Union, we don't analyze him the same way as a kid from the West... I don't expect him to go really early because it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> much of a gamble to hope he will defect." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{title track}} {{discusses}} racial classification and {{the root of}} White fear of African Americans, particularly racist concerns by some Whites over the effect of miscegenation. In the song, Chuck D argues {{that they should not}} worry as the original man was black and [...] "white comes from black / No need to be confused". The song features a vocal sample of comedian and activist Dick Gregory: [...] "Black man, black woman, black baby / white man, black woman, black baby?". [...] "Pollywanacraka" [...] also concerns interracial relations, including Blacks who leave their communities to marry wealthy Whites, and societal views of the matter: [...] "This system had no wisdom / The devil split us in pairs / and taught us white is good, black is bad / and black and white <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> bad". [...] "Meet the G That Killed Me" [...] features homophobic etiology and condemns homosexuality: [...] "Man to man / I don't know if they can / From what I know / The parts don't fit". Written by hypeman Flavor Flav and Bomb Squad-producers Keith Shocklee and Eric [...] "Vietnam" [...] Sadler, [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] features Flav as the main vocalist and criticizes the inadequacy of 9-1-1, the emergency telephone number used in the United States, and the lack of police response to emergency calls in predominantly African-American neighborhoods.|$|E

50|$|While some {{progress}} {{had been made}} in harmonising the work of international aid donors in developing countries, it was acknowledged that much more needed to be done. The aid process <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> strongly led by donor priorities and administered through donor channels, making it hard for developing countries to take the lead. Aid <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> uncoordinated, unpredictable and un-transparent. Deeper reform was felt to be essential if aid was to demonstrate its true potential in the effort to overcome poverty.|$|R

Alternatively, replacing these subintervals by ones with the left end height of each piece, we will get an approximation that is too low: for example, with twelve such subintervals we will get an approximate value for the area of 0.6203.|$|E
2500|$|After the Freud/Jung split, Jung had equally {{continued}} to use the father complex to illuminate father/son relations, {{such as in the}} case of the father-dependent patient who Jung termed [...] "a fils a papa" [...] (regarding him, Jung wrote [...] "is father <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> much the guarantor of his existence"), or when Jung noted how a positive father complex could produce an over-readiness to believe in authority. However, Jung and his followers were equally prepared to use the concept to explain female psychology, such as when a negatively charged father complex made a woman feel that all men were likely to be uncooperative, judgmental, and harsh in the same image.|$|E
