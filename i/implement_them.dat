5|$|In {{order to}} make money from Frog Fractions, Crawford first sold the game's soundtrack, with part of the {{proceeds}} going to the game's music team. He later decided to sell T-shirts containing jokes from the game in order to benefit its art team. While developing Frog Fractions, Crawford said that {{he came up with}} a lot of other video game ideas, but he then realized that he could <b>implement</b> <b>them</b> immediately into Frog Fractions rather than start a new project, due to the game's unpredictable nature.|$|E
5|$|North Korea {{has set up}} {{specific}} government {{objectives for}} tobacco control {{and there is a}} national agency to <b>implement</b> <b>them,</b> with eight full-time staff members. Although there is no free of charge smoking cessation quitline that callers could phone and discuss their problems, most health-care facilities offer support in cessation, including cessation programs and nicotine replacement therapy. Costs are covered for the patient partially or in full by the state. In addition to regular health-care clinics, there are 11 specialized anti-smoking centers in the country where consultation is free, but medicine is not. Of medicines, bupropion and varenicline are not legally available in North Korea, but herbal medicines are used as smoking cessation aids.|$|E

5|$|The 1949 Intelligence Survey Group had {{produced}} the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report, {{which found that}} the CIA had failed in its responsibilities in both the coordination and production of intelligence.

It remained to <b>implement</b> <b>them.</b> In May 1950, President Truman decided that Smith was the man he needed for the CIA. Before Smith could assume the post on 7 October, {{there was a major}} intelligence failure. The North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950, which started the Korean War, took the administration entirely by surprise, and it raised fears of a third world war.|$|E
5|$|A {{more complex}} example of stepped {{impedance}} design {{is presented in}} figure 6. Again, narrow lines are used to implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors, but in this case, the lumped-element counterpart has resonators connected in shunt across the main line. This topology {{can be used to}} design elliptical filters or Chebyshev filters with poles of attenuation in the stopband. However, calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to <b>implement</b> <b>them</b> as m-derived filters instead, which perform well and are much easier to calculate. The purpose of incorporating resonators is to improve the stopband rejection. However, beyond the resonant frequency of the highest frequency resonator, the stopband rejection starts to deteriorate as the resonators are moving towards open-circuit. For this reason, filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped-impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter. This also ensures good rejection at high frequency.|$|E
5|$|Although {{best known}} as Night of January 16th, the play's title changed {{multiple}} times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was Penthouse Legend. When Clive picked up the play, he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. The play was called The Verdict during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title Woman on Trial. When Woods took the play to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between The Black Sedan and Night of January 16th. Rand liked neither, but picked the latter. Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not <b>implement</b> <b>them.</b> Prior to the opening, he considered renaming the play The Night is Young. After the play opened, he considered changing its name each day to match the current date.|$|E

5|$|Muramasa was {{worked on}} by 16 people, {{over half the}} entire staff of Vanillaware, {{including}} Kamitani as the game's writer. The Wii {{was chosen as the}} game's platform of release as its specs were fairly close to that of the PlayStation 2, the console for which Odin Sphere was developed. This meant that the team could carry over their earlier experience rather than start from scratch learning about new hardware. Kamitani did create design proposals for versions on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but went undeveloped due to budget limitations. Using the Wii's motion controls was tested by the team, but due to the game's old-fashioned style there was little need to <b>implement</b> <b>them.</b> The biggest problem when developing for the Wii was the graphics, especially how to get the various pieces of artwork in the game's scenery to interact and respond properly. They also wanted to keep loading times down to a minimum, which was made possible due to the Wii's area pre-loading abilities. Technical tinkering of this kind went on until the end of development. The game's programmer was Kentaro Ohnishi, whose biggest challenge was creating a battle system which allowed for cancelling of attacks, while maintaining the appearance of smooth attack animation. The resultant code looked so strange that another programmer thought it was a fault and deleted it, forcing Ohnishi to rebuild it. The team was highly dedicated {{to the success of the}} project, putting a large amount of work to make it as good as it could be for players. By the time of release, funds for the company had been drained.|$|E

25|$|The {{distribution}} of benefits from adaptation and mitigation policies {{are different in}} terms of damages avoided (Toth et al., 2001:653). Adaptation activities mainly benefit those who <b>implement</b> <b>them,</b> while mitigation benefits others {{who may not have}} made mitigation investments. Mitigation can therefore be viewed as a global public good, while adaptation is either a private good in the case of autonomous adaptation, or a national or regional public good in the case of public sector policies.|$|E
25|$|In ObjC, {{and most}} other {{languages}} implementing the protocol concept, {{it is up to}} the programmer to ensure that the required methods are implemented in each class. Swift adds the ability to add these methods using extensions, and to use generic programming (generics) to <b>implement</b> <b>them.</b> Combined, these allow protocols to be written once and support a wide variety of instances. Also, the extension mechanism can be used to add protocol conformance to an object that does not list that protocol in its definition.|$|E

25|$|According to the Mexican {{government}} agency Conapo (National Population Council), Oaxaca {{is the third}} most economically marginalized state in Mexico. The state has 3.3% of the population but produces only 1.5% of the GNP.

Eighty percent of the state's municipalities do not meet federal minimums for housing and education. Most development projects are planned for the capital and the surrounding area. Little has been planned for the very rural areas and the state lacks the resources to <b>implement</b> <b>them.</b> The largest sector of Oaxaca's economy is agriculture, mostly done communally in ejidos or similar arrangements. About 31% of the population is employed in agriculture, about 50% in commerce and services and 22% in industry.
