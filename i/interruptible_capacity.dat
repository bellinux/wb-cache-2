40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to perform a cost benefit {{analysis}} of the different options for connecting distributed generation (DG) customers in a specific constrained area (the March Grid), under the context of the Flexible Plug and Play trial. The study shows the importance of the development of levels of understanding and trust among the customers and suppliers of the system-level complexities of an interconnected grid that affect all involved, of the need to achieve acceptability for all involved and the development of a shared, confident forward awareness of future evolution capability, both technically and contractually. This research required a comprehensive revision of the current regulatory framework applied to DG and the search of the most recent estimations of generation costs with a focus on wind, solar PV and anaerobic digestion (AD) generators. Specific assumptions were made in terms of <b>interruptible</b> <b>capacity</b> quota, generation mix, embedded benefits, curtailment levels and load factors. The results are presented in four different scenarios. Two kinds of connection options have been assessed: smart option (non-firm or interruptible) and reinforcement option (firm). Results suggest that in general small wind generators will always have advantage over the large wind generators regardless the type of connection, solar PV would struggle to connect and AD generators would always connect...|$|E
40|$|This study explores and quantifies the {{benefits}} of connecting more distributed generation (DG) with and {{without the use of}} smart connections in Great Britain. We examine the impacts on different parties (Distribution Network Operators, wider society and generators). As illustration we use a specific case study. Alternative connection scenarios are proposed (with partial and full <b>interruptible</b> <b>capacity</b> quota under a mix of generation with different technology-specific curtailment levels) for integrating DG units in a constrained area of the East of England covered by the Flexible Plug and Play project. The smart (interruptible) connection option is the preferred option across all the scenarios (higher NPV/MW). The analysis of the distribution of benefits between the different parties suggests that generators capture most of {{the benefits}} while DNOs and wider society capture much less benefit. A smart connection incentive, which recreates the benefits to DNOs from an earlier losses incentive, is proposed. By contrast with other societally desirable metrics which are usually incentivised or penalised, there is currently no direct connection between more DG MWs connected and DNO incentive payments. Our proposed smart connection incentive, by charging DG for smarter connection may help to distribute more efficiently the benefits for connecting more DG.

30|$|A 3 -stage {{day-ahead}} TCL scheduling {{model is}} proposed. In the first stage, the TCL aggregator solve a capacity estimation model to estimate their maximum <b>interruptible</b> TCL <b>capacities.</b> In the second stage, the system operator solves a day-ahead dispatch model {{to determine the}} load shedding instructions for TCL aggregators. In the third stage, based on the load shedding instructions, the TCL aggregators schedule the ON/OFF states of the TCLs to follow the instructions.|$|R
30|$|In {{the first}} stage, the load {{aggregators}} solve an optimization model to estimate their <b>interruptible</b> TCL <b>capacities</b> at each system dispatch interval. This {{is followed by}} the system operator that determines the load shedding instructions based which the aggregators solve a day-ahead TCL dispatch model to schedule the control plans of the TCL groups, while accounting for the occupants’ thermal comfort. The HDDE algorithm and AMPL software are employed to solve the optimization models, and the simulation results validate the proposed framework.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} interruptible load {{management}} model via incentive compatibility is researched. Simulated the <b>interruptible</b> load <b>capacity</b> and disruption of economic compensation of the interruptible load management with using MATLAB {{and compare the}} cost of interruptible load management and construction of standby units, find that interruptible load management can {{reduce the cost of}} electricity companies. But {{it should be noted that}} when the interrupt the load is too large, the implementation of interruptible load management will increase the operating costs of the utilities...|$|R
40|$|Unbundling and {{restructuring}} of local distribution services {{is the focus}} of the natural gas industry. As a result of regulatory reforms, a competitive local distribution market has emerged, and the validity of traditional cost-based regulation is being questioned. One alternative is to completely unbundle local distribution services and transform the local distribution company into a common carrier for intrastate transportation services. Three kinds of alternative pricing mechanisms are examined. For firm intrastate transportation services, cost-based pricing is the preferred method unless it can be shown that a competitive secondary market can be established and maintained. Pricing <b>interruptible</b> transportation <b>capacity</b> is discussed...|$|R
30|$|For the TCL aggregator, {{both the}} <b>interruptible</b> TCL <b>capacity</b> {{estimation}} model (14) and day-ahead TCL dispatch model (27) are non-linear, complex combinatorial optimization problems. Control {{actions of the}} TCL groups {{at a given time}} interval are dependent with the control actions at other time intervals. Considering G TCL groups and T' TCL control intervals, for both models the number of search path for the global optimization is in the order of 2 ^G × T'. This would be a tremendous, if not impossible, search task for the global optimization for models (14) and (27). In order to effectively search for the global/near-global solutions in affordable time scales, we employ a heuristic based optimization method proposed in [24], history driven differential evolutionary (HDDE) algorithm, to solve the two models.|$|R
