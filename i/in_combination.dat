40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study {{possibilities}} of efficient reasoning <b>in</b> <b>combinations</b> of theories over possibly non-disjoint signatures. We first present {{a class of}} theory extensions (called local extensions) in which hierarchical reasoning is possible, and give several examples from computer science and mathematics in which such extensions occur in a natural way. We then identify situations <b>in</b> which <b>combinations</b> of local extensions of a theory are again local extensions of that theory. We thus obtain criteria both for recognizing wider classes of local theory extensions, and for modular reasoning <b>in</b> <b>combinations</b> of theories over non-disjoint signatures. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} evidence model gives a computational {{account of}} how people classify items in single categories and <b>in</b> category <b>combinations</b> (complex categories formed by combining two or more single categories). This model sets out to explain generativity <b>in</b> category <b>combination</b> (the fact that people can classify items <b>in</b> new category <b>combinations</b> {{even if they have}} never seen any examples of those combinations). The model also aims to explain context effects such as overextension <b>in</b> category <b>combination.</b> <b>In</b> an experiment people learned to identify imaginary diseases from artificiallyconstructed patient descriptions, and then classified new patient descriptions into combinations of those disease categories. The model accurately predicted people's classification scores for patient descriptions <b>in</b> these disease <b>combinations,</b> requiring no free parameters to fit the experimental data. The experiment showed that both generativity and overextension can occur <b>in</b> <b>combinations</b> of artificially-constructed disease categories, and confirmed the model's predictions about when overextension and generativity will occur...|$|R
