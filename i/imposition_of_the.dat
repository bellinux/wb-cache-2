5|$|Capital {{punishment}} is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, {{and used in}} 31 states. No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing {{in part to a}} U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> death penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma. Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Stephen I granted {{privileges}} to the Roman Catholic Church, {{for example}} by ordering the general <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tithe upon the population. Burials in most local pre-Christian cemeteries, for example at Hunedoara, only ceased around 1100. Stephen I also divided his kingdom, including the territories of modern Romania he had occupied, into counties, that is administrative units around royal fortresses, each administered by a royal official called count. In time the voivode, a higher royal official first attested in 1176, became {{the principal of}} all the counts in Transylvania. In contrast with Transylvania, the counts in modern Banat and Crişana remained {{in direct contact with}} the king who appointed and replaced them at will.|$|E

40|$|William Blake, {{a renowned}} English poet whose {{religious}} understandings are still of controversy, has written in his poems, about <b>the</b> greatness <b>of</b> God and his creations along with <b>the</b> stressful <b>impositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church. This essay aims {{to show the}} contradiction between <b>the</b> positive perception <b>of</b> God and <b>the</b> negative perception <b>of</b> religion, which is caused by <b>the</b> <b>impositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church, through poetic pathways. Therefore, the research question is: “How does William Blake depict the contradiction between <b>the</b> positive perception <b>of</b> God and <b>the</b> negative perception <b>of</b> religion that is imposed by the Church in his poems, “The Tyger”, “The Lamb”, “The Garden of Love” and “The Little Vagabond”? <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poems given in the research question will be done {{in order to make}} certain points. The poems “The Tyger” and “The Lamb” will be analyzed to emphasize how Blake expresses <b>the</b> wonders <b>of</b> God and his creations while <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> “The Garden of Love” and “The Little Vagabond” will be done to give the reader an idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cruelty and deceit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church in William Blake’s day. During <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four poems, it is seen that <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> God is a positive one, with God being the supreme power in the universe that gives life to its creations and bestows his creations with endless resources. On the other hand, the Church is seen to create a negative perception of religion with its strict rules and deceptive practices. The essay will conclude that <b>the</b> negative perception <b>of</b> religion, created by <b>the</b> <b>impositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church, inhibits <b>the</b> true interpretation <b>of</b> Christianity and casts a shadow on <b>the</b> wonders <b>of</b> God and his creation...|$|R

5|$|In January 1629, Charles {{opened the}} second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a {{moderate}} speech on the tonnage and poundage issue. Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles's policies {{in light of the}} case of John Rolle, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage. Many MPs viewed the <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax as a breach of the Petition of Right. When Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March, members held the Speaker, Sir John Finch, down in his chair so that the ending of the session could be delayed long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism and tonnage and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber. The provocation was too much for Charles, who dissolved Parliament and had nine parliamentary leaders, including Sir John Eliot, imprisoned over the matter, thereby turning the men into martyrs, and giving popular cause to their protest.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} {{room of the}} {{transept}} there is a low slate slab altar stone, with an etched red Chi-Ro emblem, with Alpha and Omega incised. A Chi-ro is an early form of Christogram, and is formed by the super <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first two letters of the Greek alphabet onto a circle. There is a rough Cornish granite monolith seat and prie-dieu, which with the altar stone are inset with gold-enamelled small tiles by Andrew Rowe. The wall plaster has an incised red line. There is a white glazed tiled floor with red tile border around the two early Celtic crosses. In the south wall above the stone crosses are 1920s/1930s windows representing Saints Padarn, Dewi and (in the centre and above) Teilo. The Padarn window is a single-light window with a standing figure of St Padarn holding a staff and chalice, with a valley and hills behind him. It was given in memory {{of members of the}} Bonsall family, and was made by the Heaton, Butler & Bayne, London, around 1930, thus preceding Peter Lord's work on the transept.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between sections 3 and 4 and parliamentary sovereignty has been commented on most extensively. The most common criticism {{has been of}} the implied limitations on legislative supremacy. Opponents of this criticism has questioned both its factual accuracy and its suggestion that the weakening of parliamentary sovereignty should be avoided. They instead cite morality and constitutionalism as among positive features of this change. The limits of courts' powers have also been queried. The retroactivity of law making is one criticism related {{to the rule of}} law, although the advancement of human rights is seen as a positive feature also associated with the rule of law. Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague and there have been warnings of to the <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judiciary on parliament's domain, these have also been challenged.|$|E

5|$|The {{storming}} of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, {{had been}} celebrated annually since 1790, initially through quasi-religious rituals, {{and then later}} during the Revolution with grand, secular events including the burning of replica Bastilles. Under Napoleon the events became less revolutionary, focusing instead on military parades and national unity {{in the face of}} foreign threats. During the 1870s, the 14 July celebrations became a rallying point for Republicans opposed to the early monarchist leadership of the Third Republic; when the moderate Republican Jules Grévy became president in 1879, his new government turned the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille into a national holiday. The anniversary remained contentious, with hard-line Republicans continuing to use the occasion to protest against the new political order and right-wing conservatives protesting about the <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holiday. The July Column itself remained contentious and Republican radicals unsuccessfully tried to blow it up in 1871.|$|E
5|$|Following the French Revolution in 1789, {{the cause}} of republicanism was taken up in many countries, {{including}} the Kingdom of Ireland, at that time ruled by the Kingdom of Great Britain. Opposition to British rule had existed in Ireland for centuries, but the French example, combined with the <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Penal Laws which discriminated against the Catholic majority and a large Presbyterian minority, prompted {{the creation of the}} Society of United Irishmen, a broad non-sectarian coalition of groups seeking to create an Irish Republic. Initially a non-violent political movement, the United Irishmen were forced to operate as a secret society after membership was made illegal in 1793 at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Deciding that their only hope of creating the Irish Republic lay in armed revolt, the United Irishmen began secretly organising and arming their forces. In search of external aid, two of their leaders, Lord Edward FitzGerald and Arthur O'Connor travelled to Basle to meet with French General Lazare Hoche. Their efforts were supported by Protestant Dublin lawyer Theobald Wolfe Tone, who travelled to Paris to appeal to the French Directory in person. During this period, the British government repealed some of the Penal Laws, in an attempt to quell unrest.|$|E

40|$|In {{everyday}} conversation, much {{communication is}} achieved using indirect language. This {{is particularly true}} when we utter requests. The decision to use indirect language is influenced {{by a number of}} factors including deniability, politeness, and <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>imposition</b> on <b>the</b> receiver <b>of</b> a request. In this paper we report <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> an eye-tracking experiment examining the influence on reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> a request. We manipulate whether context describes a situation in which <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>imposition</b> on <b>the</b> receiver <b>of</b> <b>the</b> request is high (which thus motivates <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> indirect language) with one in which <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>imposition</b> is low (and thus does not motivate <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> indirect language). We compare <b>the</b> comprehension <b>of</b> statements that are phrased indirectly with <b>the</b> comprehension <b>of</b> statements that are phrased more directly. We find that statements phrased indirectly are read more quickly in contexts where <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>imposition</b> on <b>the</b> receiver is high versus when <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>imposition</b> is low. In contrast, we find <b>the</b> processing <b>of</b> statements phrased directly does not vary as a function <b>of</b> level <b>of</b> <b>imposition.</b> This indicates that readers use pragmatic knowledge to guide interpretation of indirect requests. Our data provide an insight into the interface between pragmatic and semantic processing...|$|R
