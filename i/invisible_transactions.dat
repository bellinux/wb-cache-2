40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{literature}} on the political economy of global financial liberalisation shows how little has been written {{on the role of the}} OECD, and how the Principal-Agent (PA) theory, complemented by Constructivist tools, can be applied helpfully to analyse this process. We show that the OECD’s Committee on Capital Movements and <b>Invisible</b> <b>Transactions</b> (CMIT) played an entrepreneurial role in encouraging the liberalization of capital flows. In particular, we argue that the CMIT slipped by acting beyond its core delegation roles and against the preferences of the OECD member states’ governments. This was done by discussing and seeking to expand the list of issue areas on which controls should be lifted to include short-term capital movements and the right of establishment, to adopt an extended understanding of reciprocity, and to eliminate a range of additional discriminatory measures on capital flows. Acting as institutional entrepreneurs, the CMIT members took advantage of the overlap among the networks in which they were engaged to spread their ideas to the member states. The CMIT’s work affected the member states’ willingness to make irrevocable, multilateral commitments through a combination of peer pressure and vertical institutional interconnectedness. Through the work of the CMIT, the OECD was an important actor in capital liberalization, in addition to the role played by other international organizations...|$|E
40|$|Cyprus is broadly {{compliant}} with International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) core principles {{in a number}} of areas including enforcement, cooperation with domestic and foreign regulators, principles for issuers, principles for market intermediaries, and market regulation. The following statistical data are presented: composition of gross-fixed capital formation, tourist travels and receipts, wage and productivity indicators, price indices, implicit deflators, monetary survey, financial indicators, social insurance funds, direction of trade, <b>invisible</b> <b>transaction,</b> balance of payments, international reserves, imports by commodity, and so on. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a case study {{that is part of}} a larger Ph. D. {{dissertation}} project: an exploration of the networks of references and ideas that make up the social lives of books online. In a time of rapidly evolving ecologies of reading and writing, I argue that the Internet affords us massive amounts of new data on previously <b>invisible</b> cultural <b>transactions.</b> New architectures for reviewing, discussing and sharing books blur the lines separating readers, authors and critics, and these cultural structures capture thousands of conversations, mental connections and personal recommendations that previously went unrecorded. I call these webs of references...|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, the BBC's Panorama {{alleged that}} Lloyds TSB Offshore in Jersey, Channel Islands was {{encouraging}} wealthy customers to evade tax. An employee of Lloyds was filmed telling a customer how several mechanisms {{could be used}} to make their <b>transactions</b> <b>invisible</b> to the UK tax authorities. [...] This action is also in breach of money laundering regulations in Jersey. Lloyds subsequently claimed that this was an isolated incident which they were investigating.|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} {{abundant}} evidence that perceived availability of support buffers {{the effects of}} stressors on mental health, the relatively meager research on support transactions has failed to show an association between actual receipt of support and adjustment to stressors. The authors examined a possible explanation for this inconsistency, that awareness of receiving support entails an emotional cost and that the most effective support is unnoticed by the recipient. Using data from a daily diary study of support provision and receipt in couples, the authors show that many transactions reported by supporters are not reported by recipients. They also show that these <b>invisible</b> support <b>transactions</b> promote adjustment to a major stressor. It is now well established that perceptions of social support availability predict better adjustment to stressful events (Cohen...|$|R
50|$|A {{transaction}} is {{a logical}} unit of processing delimited by BeginTransaction and CommitTransaction, or Rollback, operations. All updates performed during a transaction are atomic; they either all appear in the database {{at the same time}} or none appear. Any subsequent updates by other <b>transactions</b> are <b>invisible</b> to a <b>transaction.</b> However, a transaction can update only data that has not changed in the meantime; else the operation fails at once without waiting. Read-only transactions never need to wait, and update transactions can interfere only with one another updating transaction. Transactions which are terminated by Rollback, or by a system crash, leave no trace on the database. In general, the data state is restored on Rollback to what it was prior to BeginTransaction.|$|R
40|$|In {{their pursuit}} for {{sustainable}} agriculture, populations are increasingly searching for efficient utilization of resources. History suggests that human settlements actually become more sustainable when they adapt to climactic conditions confronting them. They develop built-in institutional adjustments for yielding maximum benefit from resources to achieve sustainable agriculture by converting externalities that become <b>invisibles</b> in market <b>transactions,</b> such as climate, family, and insurance, to become integral inputs {{in the production}} of agriculture. Therefore, efficient utilization can only become effective in the long run if it can promote sustainable practices which can adequately link output, technological change, and resources. After examining three alternative links among these aspects simultaneous action is suggested on two fronts. They are: (a) costs of adjustments must be paid for in their entirety, and (b) changes to resource utilization must be accomplished by institutional adjustments...|$|R
