The profile of the mirror was consistent within the range of the systematic error. For the <b>flat</b> <b>mirror,</b> the repeatability was almost 1.0 nm PV.

During the measurement, each axis is controlled numerically. The numerical control parameter is calculated in advance from the ideal shape of the sample. We detect the gap in the normal vector for the figure error using QPD because the sample has a figure error. Therefore, we can acquire the declination of the normal vectors from the QPD output signal.|$|R

40|$|Classical {{fabrication}} methods alone do not enable manufacturing {{of large}} <b>flat</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{that are much}} larger than 1 meter. This dissertation presents the development of enabling technologies for manufacturing large high performance <b>flat</b> <b>mirrors</b> and lays the foundation for manufacturing very large <b>flat</b> <b>mirrors.</b> The enabling fabrication and testing methods were developed during the manufacture of a 1. 6 meter flat. The key advantage over classical methods is that our method is scalable to larger <b>flat</b> <b>mirrors</b> up to 8 m in diameter. Large tools were used during surface grinding and coarse polishing of the 1. 6 m flat. During this stage, electronic levels provided efficient measurements on global surface changes in the mirror. The electronic levels measure surface inclination or slope very accurately. They measured slope changes across the mirror surface. From the slope information, we can obtain surface information. Over 2 m, the electronic levels can measure to 50 nm rms of low order aberrations that include power and astigmatism. The use of electronic levels for flatness measurements is analyzed in detail. Surface figuring was performed with smaller tools (size ranging from 15 cm to 40 cm in diameter). A radial stroker was developed and used to drive the smaller tools; the radial stroker provided variable tool stroke and rotation (up to 8 revolutions per minute). Polishing software, initially developed for stressed laps, enabled computer controlled polishing and was used to generate simulated removal profiles by optimizing tool stroke and dwell to reduce the high zones on the mirror surface. The resulting simulations from the polishing software were then applied to the real mirror. The scanning pentaprism and the 1 meter vibration insensitive Fizeau interferometer provided accurate and efficient surface testing to guide the remaining fabrication. The scanning pentaprism, another slope test, measured power to 9 nm rms over 2 meters. The Fizeau interferometer measured 1 meter subapertures and measured the 1. 6 meter flat to 3 nm rms; the 1 meter reference flat was also calibrated to 3 nm rms. Both test systems are analyzed in detail. During surface figuring, the fabrication and testing were operated in a closed loop. The closed loop operation resulted in a rapid convergence of the mirror surface (11 nm rms power, and 6 nm rms surface irregularity). At present, the surface figure for the finished 1. 6 m flat is {{state of the art}} for 2 meter class <b>flat</b> <b>mirrors...</b>|$|R
40|$|MUSTANG is a {{bolometer}} {{camera for}} the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) {{working at a}} frequency of 90 GHz. The detector has a field of view of 40 arcseconds. To cancel out random emission change from atmosphere and other sources, requires a fast scanning reflecting system with a few arcminute ranges. In this paper, the aberrations of an off-axis system are reviewed. The condition for an optimized system is provided. In an optimized system, as additional image transfer mirrors are introduced, new aberrations of the off-axis system may be reintroduced, resulting in a limited field of view. In this paper, different scanning mirror arrangements for the GBT system are analyzed through the ray tracing analysis. These include using the subreflector as the scanning <b>mirror,</b> chopping a <b>flat</b> <b>mirror</b> and transferring image with an ellipse mirror, and chopping a <b>flat</b> <b>mirror</b> and transferring image {{with a pair of}} face-to-face paraboloid mirrors. The system analysis shows that chopping a <b>flat</b> <b>mirror</b> and using a well aligned pair of paraboloids can generate the required field of view for the MUSTUNG detector system, while other systems all suffer from larger off-axis aberrations added by the system modification. The spot diagrams of the well aligned pair of paraboloids produced is only about one Airy disk size within a scanning angle of about 3 arcmin. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|Many {{instruments}} and techniques {{are used for}} measuring long mirror surfaces. A Fizeau interferometer {{may be used to}} measure mirrors much longer than the interferometer aperture size by using grazing incidence at the mirror surface and analyzing the light reflected from a <b>flat</b> end <b>mirror.</b> Advantages of this technique are data acquisition speed and use of a common instrument. Disadvantages are reduced sampling interval, uncertainty of tangential position, and sagittal/tangential aspect ratio other than unity. Also, deep aspheric surfaces cannot be measured on a Fizeau interferometer without a specially made fringe nulling holographic plate. Other scanning instruments have been developed for measuring height, slope, or curvature profiles of the surface, but lack accuracy for very long scans required for X-ray synchrotron mirrors.

The new interferometer is built with three <b>flat</b> <b>mirrors,</b> which include two <b>flat</b> moving <b>mirrors</b> fixed {{as a single}} moving part by a rigid structure and one <b>flat</b> fixed <b>mirror.</b> The optical path difference (OPD) is obtained by the straight reciprocating motion of the double moving mirror, and the OPD value is four times the physical shift value of the double moving mirror. The tilt tolerance of the double moving mirror of the novel interferometer is systematically analyzed by means of modulation depth and phase error. Where the square aperture is concerned, the formulas of the tilt tolerance were derived. Due to the novel interferometer&# 39;s large OPD value and low cost, it is very applicable to the high-spectral-resolution Fourier-transform spectrometers for any wavenumber region from the far infrared to the ultraviolet.
