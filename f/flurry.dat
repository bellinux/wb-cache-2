5|$|The second fight {{began with}} Jackson moving forward {{and getting into}} a clinch early. The two {{exchanged}} strikes in this position before breaking up. Jackson followed by throwing a brief <b>flurry</b> of punches and landing a knee. About halfway into the first round, Silva threw a <b>flurry</b> of punches and landed several knees from the Muay Thai Clinch before pushing Jackson against the turnbuckle. Jackson scrambled out of the clinch and scored a takedown {{with a combination of}} a leg trip and a headlock. Jackson attacked with ground and pound, but to limited damage, while Silva attempted submissions unsuccessfully. The referee then stood the fighters up due to inactivity.|$|E
5|$|As president-elect, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849. He spent the {{months following the}} election formulating his cabinet selections. He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions, to the frustration of his fellow Whigs. While he despised patronage and political games, he endured a <b>flurry</b> of advances from office-seekers looking {{to play a role}} in his administration.|$|E
5|$|In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} led to {{the creation}} of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a <b>flurry</b> of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France, and by April 1805, Britain and Russia had signed an alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, and being keen on revenge, Austria joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E

5|$|In later years, {{there was}} a <b>flurry</b> of {{contradictory}} statements from convention members (including Mason) about who composed which articles. Randolph credited Henry with Articles 15 and 16, but the latter (dealing with religious freedom), was written by Madison. Mason had imitated English law in drafting language requiring toleration of those of minority religions, but Madison insisted on full religious liberty, and Mason supported Madison's amendment once made.|$|E
5|$|M-theory is {{a theory}} in physics that unifies all {{consistent}} versions of superstring theory.

5|$|The {{death of}} Gaius in AD4 {{initiated}} a <b>flurry</b> {{of activity in}} the household of Augustus.

Along with his adoption, Tiberius received tribunician power {{as well as a}} share of Augustus's maius imperium, something that even Marcus Agrippa may never have had.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} sign of dissent {{occurred}} in 1989 when a WCG minister, Gerald <b>Flurry,</b> published a manuscript outlining {{what he and}} others believed were disturbing trends in the work, including {{the beginnings of the}} doctrinal departure from what had been established by Armstrong. <b>Flurry</b> and another minister, John Amos, were disfellowshipped and went on to form the Philadelphia Church of God (PCG). The PCG began an alternative radio program and magazine, and {{over the next several years}} a few thousand WCG members left to join the PCG. Despite this, Tkach continued to implement additional changes in thinking including: the shift in emphasis away from observing world events primarily through the lens of prophetic interpretation; the removal of the prohibition of interracial marriage; the allowance of work on the Sabbath; the acceptance of the trinitarian doctrine; and the acceptance of the validity of other Christian denominations, among many other changes. Older Armstrong publications that supported the church's once unique doctrines were allowed to go out-of-print.|$|E
5|$|The {{second round}} {{began with the}} two fighters exchanging a <b>flurry</b> of strikes.

5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed.

From {{the ranks of the}} allied army he could hear the singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E
5|$|In 1777, Henry Hamilton, a British Lieutenant Governor of Canada, {{began to}} recruit American Indian war parties to raid the Kentucky settlements. On April 24, Shawnee Indians led by Chief Blackfish {{attacked}} Boonesborough.

5|$|One {{response}} to this popularity was in commissioning the construction of replica castles. These were particularly popular at beginning of the 19th century, and again later in the Victorian period. Design manuals were published offering details of how to recreate the appearance of an original Gothic castles in a new build, leading to a <b>flurry</b> of work, such as Eastnor in 1815, the fake Norman castle of Penrhyn between 1827 and 1837 and the imitation Edwardian castle of Goodrich Court in 1828. The later Victorians built the Welsh Castell Coch in the 1880s as a fantasy Gothic construction and the last such replica, Castle Drogo, was built as late as 1911.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{demand for}} Greek New Testaments {{led to a}} <b>flurry</b> of further {{authorized}} and unauthorized editions in the early sixteenth century; almost {{all of which were}} based on Erasmus's work and incorporated his particular readings, although typically also making a number of minor changes of their own. Tregelles gives Acts 13:33 {{as an example of the}} places in which commonly received text did not follow Erasmian text (εν τω ψαλμω τω πρωτω → εν τω ψαλμω τω δευτερω).|$|E
5|$|Retaining {{his place}} for the third Test that started just days later on the same ground, Kippax {{maintained}} his superb form and hit his maiden Test century in Australia’s first innings. With Australia struggling against the pace of England's Harold Larwood, Kippax steadied the innings and then launched an assault on Larwood, hooking him for four boundaries. Journalist Ray Robinson pointed out that before Kippax’s <b>flurry</b> of fours, Larwood had taken 14 wickets at 18.3runs in the series. After, he managed only four wickets for 472runs. Kippax followed up with 41 in the second innings, as Australia fell to their third consecutive defeat in the rubber and lost the Ashes.|$|E

5|$|Speaking at {{the string}} theory {{conference at the}} University of Southern California in 1995, Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study made the {{surprising}} suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality {{and the appearance of}} two- and five-dimensional branes in string theory. In the months following Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming that the new theory involved membranes in an important way. Today this <b>flurry</b> of work is known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E
5|$|Stage eleven was {{marred by}} rainy weather, which caused many splits in the peloton. Fabio Fontanelli won the stage {{as a member of}} the lead group, but tenth-place {{finisher}} Bruno Leali gained a six-second race lead by finishing more than three minutes in front of overall leader Miguel Indurain. The Giro's twelfth stage began with a large climb which led to many attacks.

5|$|The Petition {{caused a}} <b>flurry</b> of {{broadside}} satires, poems and ballads {{on the subject}} through the following year.

Two years after the riots, a mob gathered once more and again swore they would raze Cresswell's cathouse to the ground, though protection from the local beadles prevented the attack.|$|E
