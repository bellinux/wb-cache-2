5|$|In late 1962, {{after the}} Cuban Missile Crisis had settled {{well enough to}} permit the {{evacuated}} servicemen's families to return to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more for morale there. He asked Perry Como to bring his television show to the Naval base. Perry and his cast and crew were at Guantanamo when the loved ones began their return. The first entertainers to visit the base since the crisis, the Como show filmed there for eight days. Some highlights of the program, which {{was seen in the}} US on December 12, 1962, included Como's shaving a serviceman with a Castro-like beard and the enthusiastic participation when Perry asked for volunteers to come on stage to do the Twist with the lovely ladies who were part of the visiting dance troupe.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins by}} {{summarizing}} Soul Reavers ending: Raziel confronts Kain in Nosgoth's wasteland, and pursues {{him through a}} portal leading to the past. Moebius, {{the leader of a}} vampire-hunting crusade in this age, coerces Raziel to re-embrace his former heritage as a Sarafan vampire hunter by killing Kain. Though Raziel is initially <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, his enthusiasm wanes over time as he witnesses the ruthlessness of Moebius's soldiers. Kain, who is destined to die at Raziel's hands in this era, implores Raziel to thwart fate and instead facilitate his quest to restore the Pillars. After he learns that Moebius serves The Elder God, and that he has thus been duped, Raziel faces a decision: indulge his lust for vengeance but submit to fate by killing Kain, or defy his cohorts and exercise his free will by exerting mercy.|$|E
5|$|Will Burton (Gaelan Connell) is a music enthusiast and a David Bowie fan {{with a hint}} of {{rock and}} roll and boy next door. Throughout the movie, Will writes journal-like e-mails to Bowie every day, {{although}} Bowie never answers. When Will's mother Karen (Lisa Kudrow) finds a new job, he switches to a new school, which he is <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> since he was bullied at his previous one. During lunch one day at his new school, he meets a girl who says her name is written Sa5m but pronounced Sam, the 5 is silent (Vanessa Hudgens). She tells him about Bandslam, an annual music competition in which the winning band gets a recording contract. Will and Sa5m quickly become friends but, shortly after, he is sought after by another girl named Charlotte Barnes (Aly Michalka). One afternoon, Charlotte asks Will to join her in an after-school day-care center. When she starts inviting him to hang out with her, the teenager is stunned—as is his single mother Karen. Impressed by his eclectic knowledge of music, Charlotte, who is a gifted singer-songwriter, asks Will to manage her rock/ska band. Her goal is apparently to take revenge on her egocentric musician ex-boyfriend Ben Wheatley (Scott Porter) during Bandslam.|$|E

25|$|The Gordon family, {{like the}} Byron family, {{had a history}} of turmoil and death; her {{grandfather}} drowned in 1760, her sister Abercromby died in 1777, her father drowned in Bath Canal in 1779, her other sister Margaret died in 1780, and her mother died in 1782. Her parents, to preserve the family name, had introduced a clause in their will that required the husband of their daughter to take the Gordon name as his own, which John Byron was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The two married in Bath, 13 May 1785. By July the newly-weds had settled at Gight where John Byron ran through most of the £23,000 Catherine had brought to their marriage. Soon after, he sold her property, the Castle of Gight, for £18,690 to pay off his debts. In March 1786 they went through a second marriage ceremony and John Byron became John Byron Gordon to fulfil the need to sell the estate in Gight. By the end of 1786, Catherine had lost her fortune and her land to John Byron's creditors but she never blamed him for her loss. In July 1787 John fled from the Isle of Wight, where the couple had been living to avoid creditors, to Paris. He was joined there the following September by Mrs Byron who was pregnant. In December she returned to London whilst Byron's father remained on the move to avoid creditors.|$|E

25|$|La música en Cuba (The Music of Cuba) is an ethno-musicological {{study of}} the Music of Cuba {{starting}} from the sixteenth century {{with the arrival of}} European explorers, until the present day of publication, the mid-twentieth century. The blending of different culturesblack, white, mulattoes, criollos and nativesmirrors the blending of Cuba’s two main musical styles, the Christian European music and the elemental percussion and rhythm-based music of the transported Africans and aboriginal peoples of the island. The book includes a general history of music in colonized Latin America but mainly focuses on Cuban styles of music and dance, influential Cuban musicians and Cuban musical identity. Carpentier devotes a great deal of his study to exploring the influence African descendants had on Cuban music. He has an entire chapter titled, “Los Negros” ("The Blacks") that explores the many substantial ways African music influenced all of Latin American music. According to Carpentier, the African influence on Cuban music in particular was deliberately concealed by the colonist prejudice of 18th and 19th century Cuba. At the time of the book's publication many white Cubans were reluctant to even acknowledge the blending of the cultures much less investigate it. Carpentier, though, was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so and by making bold statements about Cuba’s past and integral relationships {{with a wide range of}} cultures he succeeded in giving back to Cuba an in-depth academic perspective of its own cultural identity through its music.|$|E

Unfortunately for Charles Theodore, he was already the Elector Palatine.

He was not <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, even though Bavaria was larger and more important. He preferred living in the Palatinate, with its salubrious climate and compatible social scene. He patronized the arts, and had developed in Mannheim, his capital city, an array of theaters and museums at tremendous cost to his subjects. He hosted Voltaire at one of his many palaces. During the visit, he had enticed Voltaire's secretary, the Florentine noble Cosimo Alessandro Collini (1727–1806), into his own employment, considered a coup in some of the Enlightenment circles.

He is amused by toilet humor and bodily functions, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes.

500|$|Theme Hospital {{took over}} two years to develop. The idea came from Peter Molyneux and {{journalist}} James Leach, who explored the possibility of other Theme games while discussing Theme Park. Leach suggested a hospital, and Molyneux was enthusiastic about the idea. Development began when the designer Mark Webley selected Theme Hospital {{from a list of}} possible games put together by Molyneux, and Webley, along with the artist Gary Carr, visited the Royal Surrey County Hospital and Frimley Park Hospital to get inspiration. Carr was initially displeased at the prospect of working on Theme Hospital: he had previously left Bullfrog to work for The Bitmap Brothers because he did not have faith in Theme Park. He chose to return based on his belief that he would work on Dungeon Keeper, which he was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Initially, Theme Hospital was to feature real diseases, but these were replaced with fictional, comedic afflictions as it was decided that the game's maladies should not be too realistic: the team were faced with the dilemma of having to make the hospital fun and interesting, as Webley stated that theme parks are [...] "colourful" [...] compared to hospitals, and Carr believed that hospital rooms looked very similar and that {{it was hard to tell}} what each machines does. It was during a hospital visit that they came up with the idea of using made-up illnesses and cures: Carr considered death [...] "quite sad" [...] and believed that illness was not a popular subject. He stated that using made-up illnesses gave them [...] "creative freedom", which he believed was essential. Webley said that Carr was concerned that using real diseases might be considered distasteful. According to Carr, the team were aiming for humour rather than gore. During the initial stages of programming, Bullfrog hired James Leach, who wrote the game's text and came up with the diseases. Molyneux was not directly involved in the game's production as he was then working on Dungeon Keeper.|$|E
