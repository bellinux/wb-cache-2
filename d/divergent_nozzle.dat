40|$|In this paper, we are {{concerned}} with the global existence and stability of a smooth supersonic flow with vacuum state at infinity in a 3 -D infinitely long <b>divergent</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The flow is described by a 3 -D steady potential equation, which is multi-dimensional quasilinear hyperbolic (but degenerate at infinity) with respect to the supersonic direction, and whose linearized part admits the form _t^ 2 - 1 (1 +t) ^ 2 (- 1) (_ 1 ^ 2 +_ 2 ^ 2) + 2 (- 1) 1 +t_t for 1 << 2. From the physical point of view, due to the expansive geometric property of the <b>divergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> and the mass conservation of gas, the moving gas in the nozzle will gradually become rarefactive and tends to a vacuum state at infinity, which implies that such a smooth supersonic flow should be globally stable for small perturbations since there are no strong resulting compressions in the motion of the flow.

40|$|Abstract. The present work {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of computer code which allow the engine designer investigate the flow behavior through a <b>divergent</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The flow is assumed as quasi one dimensional and steady inviscid compressible flow. In other word the flow is governed by compressible Euler equation depending on the local Mach number. Solving such a mixed type of equation is difficult. The boundary between hyperbolic and elliptic region is not clear. To avoid such difficulty can be done through treating a steady flow problem as unsteady flow problems with the boundary condition is fixed with respect to time. As unsteady flow problem, the Euler equation becomes hyperbolic type of partial differential equation with respect to time. This approach allows one to solve the unsteady flow problem goes to a steady state solution. There are various methods can used for solving hyperbolic type of equation, such as MacCormack’s scheme, Steger – Warming’s scheme, Beam – Warming’s Scheme and TVD Scheme.

40|$|A high-beta, {{supersonic}} plasma flow plays {{a crucial}} role in MHD phenomena in space and fusion plasmas. There are a few experimental researches on production and control of a fast flowing plasma in spite of a growing significance in the magnetized-plasma flow dynamics. A magneto-plasma-dynamic arcjet (MPDA) is one of promising devices to produce a supersonic plasma flow and has been utilized as an electric propulsion device with a higher specific impulse and a relatively larger thrust. We have improved the performance of an MPDA to produce a quasi-steady plasma flow with a transonic and supersonic Mach number in a highly-ionized state. There are two methods in order to control an ion-acoustic Mach number of the plasma flow exhausted from an MPDA: one is to use a magnetic Laval nozzle to convert a thermal energy to a flow energy and the other is a combined system of an ion heating and a <b>divergent</b> magnetic <b>nozzle.</b> The former is an analogous method to a compressible air flow and the latter is the method proposed in an advanced thruster for a manned interplanetary space mission.

40|$|High-quality {{jet noise}} {{spectral}} data {{measured at the}} Aero-Acoustic Propulsion Laboratory (AAPL) at NASA Glenn is used to develop jet noise scaling laws. A FORTRAN algorithm was written that provides detailed spectral prediction of component jet noise at user-specified conditions. The model generates quick estimates of the jet mixing noise and the broadband shock-associated noise (BBSN) in single-stream, axis-symmetric jets within {{a wide range of}} nozzle operating conditions. Shock noise is emitted when supersonic jets exit a nozzle at imperfectly expanded conditions. A successful scaling of the BBSN allows for this noise component to be predicted in both convergent and convergent-divergent nozzles. Configurations considered in this study consisted of convergent and convergent- <b>divergent</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Velocity exponents for the jet mixing noise were evaluated as a function of observer angle and jet temperature. Similar intensity laws were developed for the broadband shock-associated noise in supersonic jets. A computer program called sJet was developed that provides a quick estimate of component noise in single-stream jets at a wide range of operating conditions. A number of features have been incorporated into the data bank and subsequent scaling in order to improve jet noise predictions. Measurements have been converted to a lossless format. Set points have been carefully selected to minimize the instability-related noise at small aft angles. Regression parameters have been scrutinized for error bounds at each angle. Screech-related amplification noise has been kept to a minimum to ensure that the velocity exponents for the jet mixing noise remain free of amplifications. A shock-noise-intensity scaling has been developed independent of the nozzle design point. The computer program provides detailed narrow-band spectral predictions for component noise (mixing noise and shock associated noise), as well as the total noise.

40|$|A {{previous}} axisymmetric {{model of}} the supersonic expansion of a collisionless, hot plasma in a <b>divergent</b> magnetic <b>nozzle</b> is extended here in order to include electron-inertia effects. Up to dominant order on all components of the electron velocity, electron momentum equations still reduce to three conservation laws. Electron inertia leads to outward electron separation from the magnetic streamtubes. The progressive plasma filling of the adjacent vacuum region is consistent with electron-inertia being part of finite electron Larmor radius effects, which increase downstream and eventually demagnetize the plasma. Current ambipolarity is not fulfilled and ion separation can be either outwards or inwards of magnetic streamtubes, depending on their magnetization. Electron separation penalizes slightly the plume efficiency and is larger for plasma beams injected with large pressure gradients. An alternative nonzero electron-inertia model [E. Hooper, J. Propul.
