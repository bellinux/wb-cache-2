40|$|AbstractThe {{detailed}} {{evaluation of}} regional diastolic <b>filling</b> at multiple ventricular {{levels in the}} normal human left ventricle has not previously been reported. Ultrafast computed tomography was used to characterize global and regional early diastolic <b>filling</b> in the left ventricle of 11 normal male volunteers. Regional early diastolic <b>filling</b> data from six distinct ventricular levels (apex to base) were fit to a third-order polynomial curve, and the peak rate of diastolic <b>filling</b> and time of peak <b>filling</b> were determined. Peak <b>filling</b> rate was 259 ± 17 ml/s (±SEM) as a global average, where peak <b>filling</b> rate referenced to end-diastolic volume and stroke volume across the levels examined was 3. 78 ± 0. 17 s−and 4. 83 ± 0. 20 s−respectively. Average <b>filling</b> fraction was 39 ± I%, and time to peak <b>filling</b> from end-systole was 145 ± 5 ms. Regional (tomographic) peak <b>filling</b> rates, except for the most apical level examined, were not statistically different across the ventricle. <b>Filling</b> fraction and time to peak <b>filling</b> were remarkably constant from one level to another. However, reference of regional peak <b>filling</b> rate to regional end-diastolic volume demonstrated significant nonuniformity from apex (120 % of average for all levels) to base (87 % of average for all levels). Peak <b>filling</b> rate referenced to tomographic stroke volume was less variable and not statistically different across the ventricle as a whole. In conclusion, values of regional absolute early peak diastolic ventricular <b>filling</b> rate or values normalized for regional end-diastolic volume are characteristically nonuniform across the left ventricle, whereas other variables such as <b>filling</b> fraction, time to peak <b>filling</b> and regional peak <b>filling</b> rate referenced to regional stroke volume are highly uniform. This confirms an intimate relation between rates of regional diastolic <b>filling</b> and regional ventricular size and stroke volume in the normal human heart...|$|R

Diastolic <b>filling</b> parameters {{were obtained by}} pulsed Doppler echocardiography at the tricuspid and mitral annular levels. The tricuspid early to late <b>filling</b> velocity ratios and the normalized peak <b>filling</b> rates were significantly reduced, while the atrial <b>filling</b> fraction was increased and tricuspid deceleration time was prolonged in hypertensive patients compared to controls. Right ventricular diastolic <b>filling</b> parameters correlated significantly with septal and posterior diastolic wall thickness, while left ventricular mass index correlated significantly with right ventricular diastolic <b>filling</b> parameters and right ventricular diastolic wall thickness in hypertensive subjects. Right ventricular diastolic wall thickness correlated significantly with the tricuspid early to late <b>filling</b> velocity ratio, tricuspid inflow total velocity-time integral, normalized peak <b>filling</b> rate, and peak <b>filling</b> fraction. Right ventricular diastolic <b>filling</b> parameters were closely related to left ventricular diastolic <b>filling</b> parameters in both groups.

The correlation between different <b>filling</b> defect patterns and pathologic findings was assessed using Pearson's Chi-squared and logistic regression methods.
