40|$|Abstract Background Safe and {{effective}} colonoscopy is {{aided by the}} use of endoscopic techniques and maneuvers (ETM) during the examination including patient repositioning, stiffening of the endoscope and abdominal pressure. Aim To better understand the use and value of ETM during colonoscopy by using a device that allows real-time imaging of the colonoscope <b>insertion</b> <b>shaft.</b> Methods The use of ETM during colonoscopy and their success was recorded. Experienced colonoscopists and endoscopy assistants used a commercially available electromagnetic (EM) transmitter and a special adult variable stiffness instrument with 12 embedded sensors to examine 46 patients. In 5 of these a special EM probe passed through the instrument channel of a standard pediatric variable stiffness colonoscope was used instead of the EM colonoscope. Results Thirty-nine men and 7 women {{with a mean age of}} 64 years (range 33 – 90) were studied. The cecum was intubated in 93. 5 % (43 / 46). The mean time to reach the cecum was 10. 6 minutes (range 3 – 25). ETM were used a total of 174 times in 41 of the patients to assist with cecal intubation. When ETM were required to reach the cecum, and the cecum was intubated, an average of 3. 82 ETM/patient was used. While ETM were used most often when the tip of the colonoscope was in the left side of the colon (rectum 5. 0 %, sigmoid colon 20. 7 %, descending colon 5. 0 %, and splenic flexure 11. 6 %), when the instrument was in the transverse colon (14. 8 %), hepatic flexure (20. 7 %) and ascending colon (19. 8 %) the use of ETM was also required. When the colonoscope tip was in the transverse colon, hepatic flexure and ascending colon, ETM success rates were less (61. 1 %, 52. 0 %, and 41. 7 % respectively) compared to the left colon success rates (rectum 83. 3 %, sigmoid colon 84. 0 %, descending colon 100 %, and splenic flexure 85. 7 %). Conclusion The EM colonoscope allows imaging of the <b>insertion</b> <b>shaft</b> without fluoroscopy and is a useful device for evaluating the efficacy of ETM. ETM are important tools of the colonoscopist and are used most often in the left colon where they are most effective. </p...|$|E

The packing removal tool has a cylindrical base ring {{the same size as}} the packing ring with a surface finish, perforations, knurling or threads for adhesion to the seal ring. Elongated leg shanks are mounted axially along the circumferential center. A slit or slits permit <b>insertion</b> around <b>shafts.</b> A removal tool follower stabilizes the upper portion of the legs to allow a spanner wrench to be used for insertion and removal...|$|R

30|$|Therefore, we {{devised a}} new {{construction}} method “shrink fitting method by high-frequency induction heating”, and optimized construction method by applying dynamic characteristic evaluation in robust design which can efficiently evaluate {{the feasibility of}} the construction method. Shrink fitting is a method of heating the rotor to about the recrystallization temperature and smoothly fitting the shaft by expanding {{the diameter of the}} <b>shaft</b> <b>insertion</b> hole. Compared with press fitting, this method has the advantage that it does not apply a large load to the shaft, it hardly causes a runout at the time of insertion, and even if the shaft diameter changes, it can deal with the same conditions.|$|R
50|$|More than 3,500 {{arrows and}} 137 whole longbows were {{recovered}} from the Mary Rose, a ship of Henry VIII's navy that capsized and sank at Portsmouth in 1545. It is an important source {{for the history of}} the longbow, as the bows, archery implements and the skeletons of archers have been preserved. The bows range in length from 1.87 to 2.11 m with an average length of 1.98 m. The majority of the arrows were made of poplar, others were made of beech, ash and hazel. Draw lengths of the arrows varied between 61 and 81 cm with the majority having a draw length of 76 cm. The head would add 5-15 cm depending on type, though some 2-4.5 cm must be allowed for the <b>insertion</b> of the <b>shaft</b> into the socket.|$|R
50|$|A street {{hockey stick}} {{is similar to}} an ice hockey stick in shape and size, but made of {{materials}} that will better stand up to use on asphalt or a similar playing surface. It has two main parts, the shaft and the blade. The shaft is often made of aluminum, graphite, or wood. The blade is usually made of some type of plastic, typically a blend of polyurethane, and attaches to the <b>shaft</b> by <b>insertion</b> into the <b>shaft,</b> with {{the inside of the}} shaft being coated with a specialized type of glue that requires heating to settle and solidify. Other shafts are designed to have the blade screwed onto the shaft and secured in place with screws. Some street hockey sticks are made in one-piece form and are made out of plastic, polyurethane, graphite, aluminum, wood, or a blend of these and other materials. Ice hockey and inline hockey sticks can also be used. However, street hockey sticks are usually cheaper and more durable for playing on asphalt and concrete, and as such are more common for this reason where the game is played on those surfaces. In organized dek and ball hockey leagues, most players use more expensive sticks as the quality of game play is much higher caliber than pickup street hockey and the Mulit Modular Surfaces see the games played which allow a safer and faster version of Dekhockey and are mmuch safer for running that concrete or blacktop.|$|R
40|$|Recombinant adenoviruses {{have emerged}} as {{promising}} agents in therapeutic gene transfer, genetic vaccination, and viral oncolysis. Therapeutic applications of adenoviruses, however, would benefit substantially from targeted virus cell entry, for example, into cancer or immune cells, {{as opposed to the}} broad tropism that adenoviruses naturally possess. Such tropism modification of adenoviruses requires the deletion of their natural cell binding properties and the incorporation of cell binding ligands. The short fibers of subgroup F adenoviruses have recently been suggested as a tool for genetic adenovirus detargeting based on the reduced infectivity of corresponding adenovectors with chimeric fibers in vitro and in vivo. The goal of our study was to determine functional insertion sites for peptide ligands in the adenovirus serotype 41 (Ad 41) short fiber knob. With a model peptide, CDCRGDCFC, we could demonstrate that ligand incorporation into three of five analyzed loops of the knob, namely, EG, HI, and IJ, is feasible without a loss of fiber trimerization. The resulting adenovectors showed enhanced infectivity for various cell types, which was superior to that of viruses with the same peptide fused to the fiber C terminus. Strategies to further augment gene transfer efficacy by extension of the fiber <b>shaft,</b> <b>insertion</b> of tandem copies of the ligand peptide, or extension of the ligand-flanking linkers failed, indicating that precise ligand positioning is pivotal. Our study establishes that internal ligand incorporation into a short-shafted adenovirus fiber is feasible and suggests the Ad 41 short fiber with ligand insertion into the top (IJ loop) or side (EG and HI loops) of the knob domain as a novel platform for genetic targeting of therapeutic adenoviruses...|$|R
