Its claim to fame {{lies in the fact that}} it was the first to give a fully abstract model for the programming language PCF. It has been claimed that game semantics can give a more <b>intensional</b> <b>meaning</b> for programs. This paper aims to present a strong connection between game semantics and abstract machines; basically, a step in the abstract machine corresponds to a step in a game. The abstract machines we use are based on proof-nets and proof-net cut elimination...|$|E

The model uses finite-state transducers (FSTs) to mark denoted periods of time {{on a set of}} timelines represented as a finite-state automaton (FSA). We present a treatment of SCEs corresponding to quantified phrases (any Monday; every May) and an implication operation for requiring the denotation of one SCE to contain completely that of another. ...|$|R

In particular, the biproduct dagger category of finite dimensional vector spaces over the field of real numbers accommodates both the extensional models of predicate calculus and the intensional models of quantum logic. The morphisms representing the extensional meanings of a grammatical string are translated to morphisms representing the <b>intensional</b> <b>meanings</b> such that truth is preserved. Pregroup grammars serve as the tool that transforms a grammatical string into a morphism. The chosen linguistic examples concern negation, relative noun phrases, comprehension and quantifiers...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{clarification}} {{of the category}} of content of concepts. This category is the key one for Kant and Lewis, {{as well as for}} Quinean refutation of distinction between the synthetic and the analytic. The question is: to what extent does Quine’s critique apply to Lewisean understanding of the synthetic and the analytic? The answer is a negative one. In fact, Quine’s critique in his famous Two Dogmas of Empiricism is based on resignation from the category of conceptual content. Just the opposite to Kant and Lewis, who both grounded the opposition of synthetic and analytic judgments in just this category. It brings about the necessity of some explanation of “content of concepts”. According to Kant this content is the presentations of senses, which at the same time are the arguments of concepts. In Critique of Pure Reason concepts are understood as intellectual functions, the value of which is the synthetic unity of apperception. This explanation is far from suffi cient clarity. Thus one needs to describe it in appropriate logical terms. And this was done in Analysis of Knowledge and Valuations by C. I. Lewis. Lewis achieved it by means of his <b>intensional</b> modes of <b>meaning,</b> that is: (1) comprehension, (2) signification and (3) intension. In our cognition these three <b>intensional</b> modes of <b>meaning</b> are primary to the forth mode, namely – extension. The three <b>intensional</b> modes of <b>meaning</b> determine what Lewis called the sense meaning. Sense meaning is at its bottom a kind of imaginary schema, enabling applications of linguistic terms to the world of possible experience...|$|R

40|$|My thesis studies {{communication}} systems {{that arise in}} the absence of linguistic conventions: restricted linguistic systems. Home sign and the language of unsupervised adult second language learners are examples of such systems. Jackendoff (2002) observed that utterances in these systems are governed by semantic principles, such as Agent First (a principle responsible for the intuitive difference between the two simple utterances HIT-TREE-FRED and HIT-FRED-TREE), and argued that they reflect ancient linguistic structures. As such, studying restricted linguistic systems offers a window into the earliest stages of language evolution, as well as offering insights into the cognitive biases which act to shape modern linguistic systems. In my thesis I related restricted linguistic systems to a novel experimental approach, improvised communication. I showed that gesture sequences in the improvised communication experiment are governed by semantic principles which are essentially the same as those governing restricted linguistic systems: we can therefore use improvised communication experiments as a source of evidence for semantic principles in evolutionarily early language. Moreover, I used improvised communication experiments to reveal a new semantic ordering principle governing the expression of <b>intensional</b> <b>meaning.</b> In an improvised communication experiment, participants are asked to describe events using only gesture and no speech. The methodology was first presented by Goldin-Meadow et al. (2008), who showed that participants by-pass the grammar rules of their native language and use a gesture order that is consistent with SOV (i. e. Subject-Object-Verb). Goldin-Meadow et al. conclude that this is the order in which we naturally represent events. In one study I contrasted extensional (e. g., ‘Man kicks ball’) and intensional (e. g., ‘Man searches for ball’) events. These two kinds of events differ semantically (e. g., ‘ball’ is a concrete object when it is an argument of ‘kick’, and an abstract object when it is an argument of ‘search for’), and participants use different orders to communicate about them: they consistently use SOV order for extensional and SVO order for intensional events. In a follow-up study I show that this flexibility in word order has a communicative function: ambiguous SOV gesture sequences are interpreted extensionally, while ambiguous SVO sequences are interpreted intensionally. These findings suggest added subtlety to the Goldin Meadow account: word order in improvised communication is flexible and determined by fine-grained properties of the meaning to be conveyed...|$|E

40|$|Anselm's {{argument}} {{for the existence of}} God in Proslogion Chap. II starts from the contention that `lq when a Fool hears `something-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-thought', he understands what he hears, and what he understands is in his mind. This is a special feature of the Pros. II argument which distinguishes the argument from other ontological arguments set up by, for example, Descartes and Leibniz. This is also the context which makes semantics necessary for evaluation of the argument. It is quite natural to ask `lq What is understood by the Fool, and what is in his mind? It is essential for a proper consideration of the argument to identify the object which is understood by the Fool, and so, is in his mind. A semantics gives answers to the questions of `lq What the Fool understands? and `lq What is in the Fool's mind? If we choose a semantics as a meta-theory to interpret the Pros. II argument, it makes an effective guide to identify the object. It is a necessary condition for a proper evaluation of the Pros. II argument to fix our universe of discourse, especially since, in the argument, we are involved in such talk about existing objects as Anselm's contention that `when a Fool hears `something-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-thought', he understands what he hears, and what he understands is in his mind. The ontology to which a semantic theory commits us will be accepted as our scope of objects when we introduce our semantic theory to interpret the Pros. II argument, and this ontological boundary constrains us to identify the object in a certain way. Consistent application of an ontology, most of all, is needed for the evaluation of the logical validity of an argument. If we take Frege's three-level semantics, we are ontologically committed to <b>intensional</b> entities, like <b>meaning,</b> as well as extensional entities. Sluga contends that Frege's anti-psychologism for meanings should not be interpreted as vindicating reification of intensional entities in relation to Frege's contextualism, that Frege's anti-psychologism with his contextualism is nothing but a linguistic version of Kantian philosophy for the transcendental unity of a judgement. There is, however, another possible interpretation of Frege's contextualism. According to Dummett, the significance of Frege's contextualism must be understood as a way of explanation for a word's having meaning. If Dummett's view is cogent, we could say that Frege's contextualism does not prevent our interpreting his semantics as being committed to intensional entities. We need not worry that Frege's over all semantics, especially with his contextualism, would internally deny the ontological interpretation of his theory. We see Anselm's {{argument for}} the existence of God in Pros. II is an invalid argument if we introduce Frege's three-level semantics, i. e. if we acknowledge meanings of words as entities in our universe of discourse. We can also employ extensional semantics for the interpretation of the Pros. II argument. According to extensionalists, like Quine and Kripke, we need not assume <b>intensional</b> entities, like <b>meaning,</b> to be part of our ontological domain. They argue that we can employ our language well enough without assuming intensional entities. If we choose extensional semantics as a meta-theory to interpret the Pros. II argument, it commits us only to extensional entities as objects in the Universe of our interpretation. In Sections 1. 4 and 1. 5, I show that extensional semantics makes the Pros. II argument a valid {{argument for the}} existence of God. `lq Necessary existence is the central concept of Anselm's argument for the existence of God in Proslogion Chap. III. It has been said that, even if the argument is formally valid, it cannot stand as a valid argument for the existence of God, since `lq necessary existence is an absurd concept like `lq round square. And further that even if there is a meaningful combination of concepts for `lq necessary existence, it cannot quality as a subject of an a priori argument. As objections to the interpretations which make the Pros. III argument valid, {{it has been argued that}} even if there is a concept of `lq necessary existence which is meaningful and there is another concept of `lq necessary existence which is suitable as a subject of an a priori argument, there is no concept of `lq necessary existence which is meaningful and at the same time suitable as a subject of an a priori argument. In Chap. 2 and Chap. 3, I try to show that there can be concepts of `lq necessary existence which are proof against these objections. Anselm's arguments for the existence of God in Proslogian Chap. II and Chap. III are logically valid arguments on some logical principles. Some fideists, K. Barth, for example, argue that Anselm's arguments for the existence of God in Proslogion are not proofs for the existence of God even if they are logically valid arguments. I raise the question how this attitude could be possible, in Chap. 4 and Chap. 5. Barth's fideistic interpretation of Anselm's Proslogion arguments does not find any flaw in the validity of the arguments, and it accepts the meaningfulness and truth of the premises even to the fool in Proslogion. If this is the case, i. e. if Barth's interpretation accepts the validity of the arguments and the truth of the premises, I raise the question, how can the arguments not be interpreted as proofs for the existence of God? How is it possible that the function of the arguments is not that of proving the existence of God? According to Wittgensteinian fideism, premises in the arguments should not be intelligible to those who do not believe in God's existence already, and so the real function of the arguments is the elucidation, the understanding of believer's belief, rather than proving articles of belief to unbelievers. Barth's fideistic interpretation of the arguments, however, fully recognizes the meaningfulness and truth of the premises in the arguments as well as the validity of the arguments. I argue that there could be a justification for the Barthian fideism. As Malcolm notices, there are still atheists who understand Anselm's arguments as valid, but the only possibility for the people who recognize the validity of Anselm's arguments still to remain atheists has been thought to be to challenge the truth of premises employed in the arguments. Now, of the atheistic possibility, we can change the direction of our attention, that is, to the question about the function of a logically valid argument itself. What has not been thought of in relation to Anselm's arguments is the significance of logical truth or the logical validity of an argument. We have not asked such questions as `lq What does a logical truth say? and `lq What does a logically valid argument guarantee with true premises? Let us assume that even the premises are accepted by atheists. Do they all convert to theism? If that were so, the disagreement between atheist and believer over the ontological arguments should turn only on the truth of premises. If that is not so, there is some point in raising this other question. If there are people who, recognizing the premises and validity of an argument, are still reluctant to accept the conclusion, we have reason to question the function of a valid argument. I argue that there is a way of being consistently reasonable while accepting the premises and the validity of the ontological arguments and yet remaining an atheist or an agnostic...|$|R
