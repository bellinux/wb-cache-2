25|$|Formerly {{the camel}} house, this {{enclosure}} adjoining the giraffe house was remodelled in 2006 to house okapi. Initially two males were kept: Dicky arrived from Marwell Wildlife in 2005 and Mbuti came from Bristol Zoo {{in the same}} year. In 2006 Dicky left for London Zoo {{to make way for}} a female named Stuma from Germany. In 2009 Mbuti and Dicky were swapped back, with Mbuti going to London Zoo and Dicky coming back to Chester. Other animals that can be seen here include Red forest duikers, Gambian pouched rats, butterfly barbs, <b>Gaboon</b> vipers and short-eared elephant shrews. Mount Kulal spiny mice and Mesic four-striped grass mice have also been kept here in the past along with various other small species. The Okapi bred for the first time in 2012, producing a female calf named Tafari. The success was repeated in 2014 with the birth of a new male calf.|$|E
500|$|Snakes {{have been}} a motif in human culture and {{religion}} and an object of dread and fascination all over the world. The vivid patterns of snake scales, such as the <b>Gaboon</b> Viper, both repel and fascinate the human mind. Such patterns have inspired dread and awe in humans from pre-historic times and these {{can be seen in}} the art prevalent to those times. [...] Studies of fear imagery and psychological arousal indicate that snake scales are a vital component of snake imagery. Snake scales also appear to have affected Islamic art in the form of tessallated mosaic patterns which show great similarity to snake-scale patterns.|$|E
2500|$|The Skylark 4 has a {{high wing}} with a single inner section of {{parallel}} chord extending out almost to mid span, followed by outer sections with taper on the trailing edges. [...] Ailerons filled {{almost all of the}} outer sections and airbrakes, operating in pairs above and below the wings, are mounted on the main spar in the inboard section. [...] The wing is wooden, built around a main spar of Spruce and a lighter rear spar and <b>Gaboon</b> ply covered from this rear spar forward. [...] Behind this spar the wing was fabric covered, though the ailerons were ply skinned. The <b>Gaboon</b> ply was applied diagonally across the ribs, which produced a very smooth wing-surface that is claimed to generate a laminar airflow. This in turn gives a best-glide ratio of 1:36 which is comparable with early fibreglass gliders.|$|E
2500|$|The zoo's reptile and {{amphibian}} house exhibits seventy {{species of}} reptiles and amphibians. These include [...] Aldabra tortoises, radiated tortoises, spider tortoises, Cuban crocodiles, a Gharial, a Philippine crocodile, Eastern indigo snakes, <b>Gaboon</b> vipers, gila monsters, green anacondas, [...] Burmese rock pythons, green tree pythons, Timor pythons, king cobras, northern copperheads, Eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, hellbenders, [...] eastern red-backed salamanders, [...] long-tailed salamanders, Alligator snapping turtles and many more.|$|E
2500|$|The Slingsby Swallow was a wooden-framed aircraft, {{covered in}} a mixture of plywood and fabric. [...] Its high mounted, cantilever, straight-tapered and square-tipped wing had 3.3o dihedral. [...] It was <b>Gaboon</b> plywood-skinned and built around a single spruce spar, with a leading-edge torsion box. Its {{unbalanced}} ailerons were fabric covered; there were no flaps but dive brakes could be extended in pairs above and below the wings. [...] The prototype had a 12 m span wing, but all production aircraft had their performance enhanced by an extension to 13.05 m.|$|E
2500|$|Located {{across from}} the Tropical Bird House, the herpetarium {{is home to the}} zoo's snakes, American alligators, lizards, and frogs. [...] It {{includes}} the rare Louisiana pine snake in addition {{to some of the most}} venomous snakes in the world, including the green mamba and <b>Gaboon</b> viper. It is home to an alligator snapping turtle. In a seasonal exhibit, a simulated shallow pond provides favorable breeding habitat for the highly endangered Mississippi gopher frog; this exhibit also features a slide presentation describing the zoo's participation in the frog's recovery program.|$|E
2500|$|The first canard {{aircraft}} {{designed and}} built by Roger Junqua was the one-off Volucelle RJ02, first flown by the designer's son Jean-Claude in 1985. This, the first modern French canard, {{was used as a}} development vehicle to refine the final Ibis design. [...] The Ibis first flew in 1991 and retains much in common with the Volucelle both in general layout and in some detail, though it has a more powerful Volkswagen engine. It is designed to be homebuilt from plans, not from a kit; its structure is entirely constructed from spruce or similar wood, covered with birch and <b>Gaboon</b> mahogany plywood.|$|E
2500|$|The Slingsby Dart was {{the last}} of a long line of gliders and {{sailplanes}} built by Slingsby Sailplanes Ltd almost entirely from wood. [...] From the Slingsby Skylark 2 of 1953 onwards, the company had used <b>Gaboon</b> ply, thicker but less dense than the traditional birch for surfacing wings and fuselage, as it gave a smoother surface capable of maintaining the more demanding profiles of the newer aerofoils. The Capstan flew ten years later with double curvature parts of the fuselage skin produced from glass-reinforced plastic (G.R.P). Combined, these were the construction methods initially used for the Dart.|$|E
2500|$|The Skylark 3 had high, pylon mounted wings with {{an inner}} section of {{parallel}} chord extending out almost to mid span, {{followed by an}} outer section with taper on the trailing edge. [...] Ailerons filled much of the outer sections and airbrakes, operating in pairs {{above and below the}} wings, were mounted on the main spar in the inboard section. The structure of the wing, like that {{of the rest of the}} aircraft was wooden, built around a main spar and a lighter rear spar and <b>Gaboon</b> ply covered from this rear spar forward. [...] Behind this spar the wing was fabric covered, though the ailerons were ply skinned. [...] The fuselage was a semi-monocoque, elliptical in cross section and built around spruce frames with a plywood skin. [...] The cockpit was immediately ahead of the pylon and wing leading edge, enclosed with a perspex canopy. [...] Tapered and clipped tailplane and elevators were mounted on top of the fuselage, far enough forward that the rudder hinge was behind the elevators. [...] These surfaces were plywood covered. [...] Fin and rudder together were tapered and flat topped; the fin was also ply skinned, but the unbalanced rudder was fabric covered. [...] Compared with the Skylark 2, vertical tail areas were increased by 35% and horizontal areas by 23%. [...] The undercarriage was conventional, with a nose skid, fixed monowheel and a small, faired tailskid.|$|E

6000|$|The only pelagic islands off the <b>Gaboon</b> coast are the Brancas, Great and Little; Corisco Island, {{which we}} shall {{presently}} visit; Great and Little Elobi, called by old travellers Mosquito Islands, probably for [...] "Moucheron," [...] a Dutchman {{who lost his}} ship there in 1600. The land about the mouths of the Ogobe is a mass of mangrove swamps, like the Nigerian Delta, which high tides convert into insular ground; these, however, must be considered terra firma in its infancy. The riverine islands of the <b>Gaboon</b> proper will be noticed as we ascend the bed.|$|E
60|$|We shall ascend the <b>Gaboon</b> estuary to its sources. South of it, {{a number}} of sweet little water-courses break the shore-line {{as far as the}} Nazareth River, which debouches north of Urungu, or Cape Lopez (Cabo de Lopo Gonsalvez), and which forms by anastomosing with a {{southern}} river the Ogobe (Ogowai of M. du Chaillu), a complicated delta whose sea-front extends from north to south, at least eighty miles. Beyond Cape Lopez is an outfall, known to Europeans as the Rio Mexias: it is apparently a mesh in the net- work of the Nazareth-Ogobe. The same may be said of the Rio Fernão Vaz, about 110 miles south of the <b>Gaboon,</b> and of yet another stream which, running lagoon-like some forty miles along the shore, has received in our maps the somewhat vague name of R. Rembo or River River. Orembo (Simpongwe) being the generic term for a stream or river, is applied emphatically to the Nkomo branch of the <b>Gaboon,</b> and to the Fernão Vaz.|$|E

60|$|The French naval officers, whose {{letters are}} {{appended}} {{to the late}} M. Isidore Geoff. Saint Hilaire's excellent essay on the Gorilla [5], note in similar terms {{the width of the}} <b>Gaboon,</b> the trees that line its banks down to the water's edge, and the strong current that sets out of it. They describe two islands in its estuary;--one low, called Perroquet; the other high, presenting three conical hills, called Coniquet; and one of them, M. Franquet, expressly states that, formerly, the Chief of Coniquet was called 'Meni-Pongo', meaning thereby Lord of 'Pongo'; and that the 'N'Pongues' (as, in agreement with Dr. Savage, he affirms the natives call themselves) term the estuary of the <b>Gaboon</b> itself 'N'Pongo'.|$|E
6000|$|They are {{not wanting}} who declare {{them to be}} rich in {{precious}} metals. Some thirty years ago an American super-cargo ascended the Rembwe River, the south-eastern line of the <b>Gaboon</b> fork, and {{is said to have}} collected [...] "dirt" [...] which, tested at New York, produced 16 dollars per bushel. All the old residents in the <b>Gaboon</b> know the story of the gold dust. The prospector was the late Captain Richard E. Lawlin, of New York, who was employed by Messrs. Bishop of Philadelphia, the same house that commissioned the chasseur de gorilles to collect [...] "rubber" [...] for them, and who was so eminently useful to the young French traveller that the scant notice of his name is considered curious.|$|E
60|$|The French naval officers, whose {{letters are}} {{appended}} {{to the late}} M. Isidore Geoff. Saint Hilaire's excellent essay on the Gorilla,* ([Footnote] *'Archives du Museum', tome x.) note in similar terms {{the width of the}} <b>Gaboon,</b> the trees that line its banks down to the water's edge, and the strong current that sets out of it.

6000|$|The {{last thing}} the prince did was to carry off, without a word of leave, the mission boat and the three Kru-boys, whom he kept two days. I was uneasy about these fellows, who, hating and fearing the <b>Gaboon</b> [...] "bush," [...] are ever ready to bolt.|$|E
6000|$|The {{language}} of the Mpongwe has been fairly studied. T. Edward Bowdich ("Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee," [...] London, Murray, 1819) when leaving the West Coast for England, touched at the <b>Gaboon</b> in a trading vessel, and visited Naango (King George's Town), on Abaaga Creek, which he places fifty miles up stream. He first gave (Appendix VI.) {{a list of the}} Mpongwe numerals. In 1847 the [...] "Missionaries of the A. B. C. F. M." [...] <b>Gaboon</b> Mission, Western Africa, printed a [...] "Grammar of the Mpongwe Language, with Vocabularies" [...] (New York,Snowden and Pratt, Vesey Street), perhaps a little prematurely; it is the first of the four dialects on this part of the coast reduced to system by the American Missionaries, especially by the Rev. Mr. Leighton Wilson, the others being Bakele, Benga, and Fán.|$|E
60|$|My {{first visit}} to the Rev. William Walker made me regret my {{precipitate}} trip to Mbátá: he told me what I now knew, that it was the wrong line, and that I should have run two or three days up the Rembwe, the first large influent on the southern bank of the <b>Gaboon.</b> He had come out to the River in 1842, and had spent twenty years of his life in Africa, with occasional furloughs home. He greatly interested me by a work which he was preparing. The <b>Gaboon</b> Mission had begun its studies of the many native dialects by the usual preparatory process of writing grammars and vocabularies; after this they had published sundry fragmentary translations of the Scriptures, and now they aimed at something higher. After spending years in building and decorating the porticoes of language, they were ambitious of raising the edifice to which it is only an approach; in other words, of explaining the scholarship of the tongue, the spirit of the speech.|$|E
60|$|When the palaver {{ended and}} the tide served, a fierce tornado broke upon us, and the sky looked grisly in the {{critical}} direction, north-east. Having no wish to recross the <b>Gaboon</b> River during a storm blowing a head wind, I resolved to delay my departure till the morrow, and amused myself with drawing from the nude {{a picture of the}} village and village-life in Pongo-land.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>Gaboon</b> country, {{to retain}} the now {{familiar}} term, although no one knows much about its derivation, is placed, by old travellers in [...] "South Guinea," [...] the tract lying along the Ethiopic, or South Atlantic Ocean, limited by the Camarones Mountain-block in north latitude 4°, and by Cabo Negro in south latitude 15° 40' 7", a sea-line of nearly 1,200 miles. The <b>Gaboon</b> proper is included between the Camarones Mountains to the north, and the [...] "Mayumba,"properly the [...] "Yumba" [...] country southwards, in south latitude 3° 22',--a shore upwards of 400 miles long. The inland depth is undetermined; geographically we should limit it to the Western Ghats, which rarely recede more than 60 miles from the sea, and ethnologically no line can yet be drawn. The country is almost bisected by the equator, and by the Rio de Gabão, which discharges in north latitude 0° 21' 25" [...] and east longitude 9° 21' 23"; and it corresponds in parallel with the Somali-Galla country and the Juba River on the east coast.|$|E
60|$|Whilst English Gambia is monopolised by the French, French <b>Gaboon</b> is, {{or rather}} was, in English hands. For {{a score of}} years men of sense have asked, 'Why not {{exchange}} the two?' When nations so decidedly rivalistic meet, assuredly {{it is better to}} separate à l'aimable. Moreover, so long as our economical and free-trade 'fads' endure, it is highly advisable to avoid the neighbourhood of France and invidious comparisons between its policy and our non-policy, or rather impolicy.|$|E
60|$|Ostik implored {{his master}} {{to take him}} with him across the sea; but Frank pointed out {{to him that he}} would not be happy long in England, where the customs were so {{different}} from his own, and where in winter he would feel the cold terribly. Ostik yielded to the arguments, and having earned enough to purchase for years the small comforts and luxuries dear to the negro heart, he agreed to start for the <b>Gaboon</b> immediately Frank left for England.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{the word}} 'Pongo' be of African origin, it is {{probably}} a corruption of the word 'Mpongwe', {{the name of the}} tribe {{on the banks of the}} <b>Gaboon,</b> and hence applied to the region they inhabit. Their local name for the Chimpanzee is 'Enche-eko', as near as it can be Anglicized, from which the common term 'Jocko' probably comes. The Mpongwe appellation for its new congener is 'Enge-ena', prolonging the sound of the first vowel, and slightly sounding the second.|$|E
60|$|In regions {{richer than}} the Upper Gambia the {{disappearance}} of man is ever followed by a springing of bush and forest so portentous that a few hands are helpless and hopeless. Such {{is the case with}} the great wooded belt north of the Gold Coast, where even the second-growth becomes impenetrable without the matchet, and where the swamps and muds, bred and fed by torrential rains, bar the transit of travellers. The Whydah and <b>Gaboon</b> countries are notable specimens of once populous regions now all but deserted.|$|E
6000|$|Those {{who have}} shot under such {{circumstances}} will readily understand that everything depends upon [...] "luck;" [...] one man may beat the forest assiduously and vainly {{for five or six}} weeks; another will be successful on the first day. Thus whilst I, without any fault of my own, utterly failed in shooting a gorilla, although I saw him and heard him, and came upon his trail, and found his mortal spoils, another traveller had hardly landed in the <b>Gaboon</b> before he was so fortunate as to bring down a fine anthropoid.|$|E
60|$|There was {{not much}} {{to see in the}} town of Clarence, whose {{population}} consists entirely of traders from Sierra Leone, Kroomen, etc. The natives, whose tribal name is Adiza, live in little villages in the interior. They are an extremely primitive people, {{and for the most part}} dispense altogether with clothing. The island belongs to Spain, and is used as a prison, the convicts being kept in guard ships in the harbor. After a stay of three days there Mr. Goodenough and Frank took passage in a sailing ship for the <b>Gaboon.</b>|$|E
60|$|On {{the sixteenth}} day after leaving Fernando Po {{they entered the}} <b>Gaboon.</b> On the right hand bank were the fort and {{dwellings}} of the French. A little farther up stood the English factories; and upon a green hill behind, the church, school, and houses of an American mission. On the left bank was the wattle town of King William, the sable monarch of the <b>Gaboon.</b> Mr. Goodenough at once landed and made inquiries for a house. He succeeded in finding one, consisting of three rooms, built on piles, an important point in {{a country in which}} disease rises from the soil. At Bonny Mr. Goodenough had, {{with the assistance of the}} agent, enlisted six Houssas. These people live much higher up on the coast, but they wander a good deal and may be met with in most of the ports. The men had formed a guard in one of the hulks, but trade having been bad the agent had gone home, and they were glad to take service with Mr. Goodenough. They spoke a few words of English, and, like the Kroomen, rejoiced in names which had been given them by sailors. They were called Moses, Firewater, Ugly Tom, Bacon, Tatters, and King John. They were now for the first time set to work, and the goods were soon transported from the brig to the house.|$|E
6000|$|In 1847, Dr. Savage had {{the good}} fortune to make another and most {{important}} addition to our knowledge of the man-like Apes; for, being unexpectedly detained at the <b>Gaboon</b> river, he saw in the house of the Rev. Mr. Wilson, a missionary resident there, [...] "a skull represented by the natives to be a monkey-like animal, remarkable for its size, ferocity, and habits." [...] From the contour of the skull, and the information derived from several intelligent natives, [...] "I was induced," [...] says Dr. Savage (using the term Orang in its old general sense) [...] "to believe that it belonged to a new species of Orang. I expressed this opinion to Mr. Wilson, with a desire for further investigation; and, if possible, to decide the point by the inspection of a specimen alive or dead." [...] The result of the combined exertions of Messrs. Savage and Wilson was not only the obtaining of a very full account of the habits of this new creature, but a still more important service to science, the enabling the excellent American anatomist already mentioned, Professor Wyman, to describe, from ample materials, the distinctive osteological characters of the new form. This animal was called by the natives of the <b>Gaboon</b> [...] "Enge-ena," [...] a name obviously identical with the [...] "Ingena" [...] of Bowdich; and Dr. Savage arrived at the conviction that this last discovered of all the great Apes was the long-sought [...] "Pongo" [...] of Battell.|$|E
6000|$|My trip to Gorilla-land {{was limited}} by the cruise upon which H.M.S.S. [...] "Griffon" [...] had been ordered, namely, {{to and from the}} South Coast with mail-bags. Many of those whom I had wished to see were absent; but Mr. Hogg set to work in the most business- like style. He {{borrowed}} a boat from the Rev. William Walker, of the <b>Gaboon</b> Mission, who kindly wrote that I should have something less cranky if I could wait awhile; he manned it with three of his own Krumen, and he collected the necessary stores and supplies of cloth, pipes and tobacco, rum, white wine, and absinthe for the natives.|$|E
6000|$|The coiffure of the <Greek> [...] is {{peculiar}} {{and elaborate}} {{as that of}} the Gold Coast. These ladies seem to have chosen for their model the touraco or cockatoo,--they have never heard of [...] "Kikeriki,"--and the effect is at first wondrously grotesque. Presently the eye learns to admire pretty Fanny's ways; perhaps the pleureuse, the old English corkscrew ringlet, might strike the stranger as equally natural in a spaniel, and unnatural in a human. Still a style so peculiar requires a toilette in keeping; the [...] "king" [...] in uniform is less ridiculous than the <b>Gaboon</b> lady's chignon, contrasting with a tight-bodied and narrow-skirted gown of pink calico.|$|E
