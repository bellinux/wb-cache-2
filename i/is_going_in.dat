He cannot allow the woman he loves to be dragged down into his world of degradation and disgrace and he cannot escape his own evil fate; he resolves this paradox by stabbing Amalia to death.

25|$|The {{striping}} {{pattern of}} the zebra is unique among sympatric ungulates. One suggested function for the stripes is to provide crypsis for the animal in tall grass or in the dappled shade beneath bushes and trees. However, cryptically coloured species, such as the kudu and bushbuck, tend to be quiet and stealthy. They freeze when there is danger and flee only at the last moment. By contrast, the zebra is active and noisy, and makes no attempt to hide itself. Another suggestion is motion camouflage, that the stripes affect a predator's judgement of the zebra's size, distance and what direction it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>in.</b> A 2014 study supports this hypothesis, finding that, when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, via two visual illusions, the wagon wheel effect, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the barber pole illusion, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction. A related hypothesis is that the stripes {{make it difficult for}} a predator to single out and learn about an individual during a chase.|$|E

In an {{interview}} with MTV News, she announced that [...] "the new music <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> a different direction. Not on purpose, but I just want to hear something fresh and mostly uptempo. I think that's where I {{want to go on}} this one. You feel different every album, and [...] this stage I feel like I want {{to do a lot of}} uptempo [...]" [...] The same year, Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by actress Charlize Theron's bob cut in the 2005 science fiction thriller Æon Flux.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: {{to conduct}} {{researches}} of influence of classes of the sportswomen who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> for bodybuilding and fitness-bikini on manifestation of physical qualities in different {{phases of the}} ovarian-menstrual cycle. Material & Methods: researches were conducted in sports fitness-clubs of Kharkov "Feromon", "Gorod", “King” with the qualified sportswomen who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> for bodybuilding and fitness-bikini within 3 months of the preparatory period in number of 14 people. We used as methods of the research: the analysis of references and testing of level of motive qualities in separate phases of OMC. Results: the theoretical analysis of features of the accounting of phases of OMC at sportswomen is submitted and the testing {{of the level of}} development of physical qualities in different phases of the specific biological cycle at the qualified sportswomen, who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> for bodybuilding, <b>is</b> held. Conclusions: the received results demonstrate that physical efficiency of the qualified sportswomen, who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> for bodybuilding, <b>is</b> not identical in phases of the ovarian-menstrual cycle. It is revealed that the best conditions for performance of considerable exercise stresses in post-ovulatory and post-menstrual phases of OMC, therefore it is expedient to plan them in the preparatory periods of the qualified sportswomen, who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> for bodybuilding...|$|R
500|$|Chicago's bid was {{supported}} by major preliminary corporate commitments, philanthropic efforts by wealthy Chicagoans, promised planning participation by {{a wide range of}} community and government leaders, and the enthusiasm of the citizenry. Local support for the bid on the South Side, particularly in the Washington Park and Woodlawn community areas, was divided. Ben Joravsky, a Chicago Reader columnist, was one of the strongest critics of the Chicago 2016 bid. However, 2007 opinion polls indicated 76 percent public support. [...] In 2009, as the final selection approached, opponents of the bid became vocal even though organizers seemed to be pleased with the bid's progress and presentation. Peter Ueberroth stated, [...] "Chicago <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> the right direction, and we are impressed by that." ...|$|E
500|$|Soviet Strike {{received}} criticism {{regarding the}} player's limited {{view of his}} surroundings and attacks from enemies out with it. To offset this potential problem, the developers added a radar to the HUD, which illustrated surrounding enemies to the player. Gamers also criticized the difficulty of Soviet Strike. A high difficulty level being traditional to the Strike series, the team {{did not wish to}} alienate long-term fans by making Nuclear Strike directly easier, but instead more accessible, using such devices as the new radar, a new compass indicating the direction of the next objective and [...] "a lot more visual and audible clues". Producer Kosaka explained: [...] "A lot of the stuff we couldn't fit in [...] <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> this one". The team added several new vehicles, as well as continuing the occasional real time strategy sections found in Soviet Strike. The jets proved problematic in early testing due to their speed, but appeared in the final game. Heat-seeking missiles were among other new additions, as was a proprietary technology termed the Interactive Music System. This generates more [...] "pulse pounding" [...] music depending on the level of action occurring in-game. Palomar Studios created the full motion video, for which some footage was shot in both Thailand and the Bronson Cave, used as the Batcave in the 1960s television incarnation of Batman. This latter shoot also employed a live tiger.|$|E
500|$|Peter Gaston of Spin {{wrote that}} the video for [...] "Hard" [...] resembles [...] "Janet Jackson's 'Rhythm Nation' meets Christina Aguilera's 'Dirrty' phase—Rihanna vamps in dimly lit outposts, dodges explosions in the desert, and, quite enticingly, takes a break from boot camp to smother herself with mud. Morale-boosting, indeed!" [...] James Dinh of MTV News showed the video, on a small player, to fans in Times Square in New York City to ask their opinions. Most said she looked [...] "sexy" [...] in the video, and {{agreed that it was}} {{different}} from previous videos and shows where she came from and where she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> her personal life. Bill Lamb of About.com wrote, [...] "I must confess that I do fail to understand the point of Rihanna humping the gun turret of a pink tank dressed in Mickey Mouse ears. It seems pains were taken to make the setting look like Afghanistan or Iraq with the other actors looking as close to real military personnel as possible." [...] Lamb criticized the video's lack of sensitivity and respect for using an army and weapons of destruction to glamorize war, saying, [...] "Does Def Jam, Rihanna's label, need to be reminded that this comes on the heels of sadly sending off an additional 30,000 troops from our country to real war? In my mind {{this is one of the}} most tasteless, offensive moves by a major pop artist in recent memory." ...|$|E

500|$|Burton's {{portrayal}} of Dylan has been generally well received. The character's romance with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), however, garnered a negative response from viewers and critics alike. Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that their storyline was [...] "everyone’s favorite storyline for curing insomnia". Despite negative reviews, Burton's portrayal during the storyline was praised, specifically by journalist Connie Passalacqua Hayman, who wrote: [...] "But it was Steve Burton as Dylan who {{stole the show}} with Dylan’s tearful and very sensitive reaction to the news, as his character loves what he believed to be his baby very much." [...] When {{the truth about the}} paternity of Chelsea's child was revealed, Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps remarked (in reference to Burton), [...] "When the truth came out it provided some meaty material for this fan favorite." [...] Sara Bibel of Xfinity gave a mixed review when Dylan was revealed as Nikki's son, writing: [...] "However, the foreshadowing that Dylan (Steve Burton) is going to turn out to be Nikki’s long-lost son is so heavy-handed that it seems hard to believe that the show <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> any other direction. Dylan is the right age. He looks like he could be related to Nikki. The character is in desperate need of a more ties to the canvas; being Avery’s ex is not enough to keep him in town, much less front-and-center. My big objection to this twist is, what’s the actual story? We have spent months learning every single thing about this character who probably would not exist if Y hadn’t {{jumped at the chance to}} poach Burton from GH." [...] She added: [...] "Dylan would get a mother to replace his father that passed away. Nikki would get a child who can use his carpentry skills to build her a nice bookcase. That’s sweet, but it’s a situation, not a plot. There really aren’t any consequences. Nick would be angry that the guy he’s convinced Avery still loves is his half-brother, but he already has one half-brother he despises. Another one really isn’t a big deal." [...] Burton's portrayal earned him a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Tashan {{opened to}} mixed reviews. Most of the Indian critics criticised the film's lacklustre script penned by {{director}} Vijay Krishna Acharya. Critic Taran Adarsh from indiaFM gave the film a 1.5 out of 5 rating {{and concluded that}} it was [...] "...one of the weakest films {{to come out of}} the Yash Raj banner." [...] Rajeev Masand from CNN-IBN described the film as [...] "...a road movie...that <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> all the wrong directions." [...] On the other hand, Sanjay Ram, who gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5, wrote, [...] "The film, though with many slips, is thoroughly engaging and entertaining.

2500|$|Senator Chris Dodd, who co-proposed {{the legislation}}, has {{classified}} the legislation as [...] "sweeping, bold, comprehensive, [...] long overdue". In {{regards to the}} Fed and what he regarded as their failure to protect consumers, Dodd voiced his opinion that [...] " [...] I really want the Federal Reserve {{to get back to}} its core enterprises [...] We saw over the last number of years when they took on consumer protection responsibilities and the regulation of bank holding companies, it was an abysmal failure. So the idea that we're {{going to go back and}} expand those roles and functions at the expense of the vitality of the core functions that they're designed to perform <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> the wrong way." [...] However, Dodd pointed out that the transfer of powers from the Fed to other agencies should not be construed as criticism of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, but rather that [...] "t's about putting together an architecture that works".|$|E
