40|$|Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) {{provide a}} vast {{possibility}} in enabling {{the brain to}} communicate directly with the computer, hence providing an alternative in controlling the machines without much effort. <b>In</b> fields of <b>rehabilitations</b> robotics, the applications of an exoskeletons in assisting a spinal cord injured (SCI) patients were growing. Steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) based BCIs that utilizes the human visual reactions to the constant flickered stimulus quickly showed its potentials among the BCIs used <b>in</b> <b>rehabilitations</b> devices because of its advantages such as a higher immunity to noises and artefacts and also its robustness compared to other BCIs. Rehabilitation exoskeletons demands an approach that are more user friendly and the aspects of control scheme and mechanical parts that are more focused on assisting the patients <b>in</b> <b>rehabilitations</b> and providing a SCI patients an alternatives to explore their surroundings in a more intuitive ways. This paper highlights the current development trends in SSVEP based BCIs for rehabilitation exoskeletons and proposed the potential research scopes {{in the future that}} can improve the effectiveness, and its potential applications <b>in</b> <b>rehabilitations...</b>|$|R

5|$|Beiderbecke's most {{influential}} recordings date from {{his time with}} Goldkette and Whiteman, although they were generally recorded under his own name or Trumbauer's. The Whiteman period also marked a precipitous decline in Beiderbecke's health, {{brought on by the}} demand of the bandleader's relentless touring and recording schedule in combination with Beiderbecke's persistent alcoholism. A few stints <b>in</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> centers, as well as the support of Whiteman and the Beiderbecke family in Davenport, did not check Beiderbecke's decline in health. He left the Whiteman band in 1930 and the following summer died in his Queens apartment at the age of 28.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved <b>in</b> <b>rehabilitation.</b> Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E

40|$|Methods of {{identifying}} malnutrition <b>in</b> the <b>rehabilitation</b> setting require further examination so that patient outcomes may be improved. The {{purpose of this}} narrative review was to: (1) examine the defining characteristics of malnutrition, starvation, sarcopenia and cachexia; (2) review the validity of nutrition screening tools and nutrition assessment tools <b>in</b> the <b>rehabilitation</b> setting; and (3) determine the prevalence of malnutrition <b>in</b> the <b>rehabilitation</b> setting by geographical region and method of diagnosis. A narrative review was conducted drawing upon international literature. Starvation represents one form of malnutrition. Inadequate energy and protein intake are the critical factor in the aetiology of malnutrition, which is distinct from sarcopenia and cachexia. Eight nutrition screening tools and two nutrition assessment tools have been evaluated for criterion validity <b>in</b> the <b>rehabilitation</b> setting, and consideration {{must be given to}} the resources of the facility and the patient group in order to select the appropriate tool. The prevalence of malnutrition <b>in</b> the <b>rehabilitation</b> setting ranges from 14 - 65 % worldwide with the highest prevalence reported in rural, European and Australian settings. Malnutrition is highly prevalent <b>in</b> the <b>rehabilitation</b> setting, and consideration must be given to the patient group when determining the most appropriate method of identification so that resources may be used efficaciously and the chance of misdiagnosis minimise...|$|R
5|$|In early 1994, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a European tour. Nirvana's final concert took place in Munich, Germany, on March 1. In Rome, {{on the morning of}} March 4, Cobain's wife, Courtney Love, found Cobain unconscious in their hotel room and he was rushed to the hospital. A doctor from the hospital told in a press conference that Cobain had reacted to a combination of prescribed Rohypnol and of alcohol. The rest of the tour was cancelled. In the ensuing weeks, Cobain's heroin addiction resurfaced. An intervention was organized, and Cobain was convinced to admit himself into drug rehabilitation. After less than a week <b>in</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> Cobain climbed over the wall of the facility and took a plane back to Seattle. A week later, on Friday, April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head at his home in Seattle.|$|E
5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical and occupational therapy <b>in</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> especially if they interfere with activities of daily living. Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.|$|E
5|$|Karen devastated Guam {{with wind}} gusts {{estimated}} up to 280 km/h (185 mph). Ninety-five percent of homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving at least 45,000 people homeless. Communication and utilities were crippled, forcing officials {{to set up}} water distribution centers to prevent disease. Total losses on the island amounted to $250 million. Despite {{the severity of the}} damage, only 11 people were killed. In the wake of the storm, a massive relief operation evacuated thousands to California, Hawaii, and Wake Island. Thousands more were sheltered in public buildings, and later tent villages, for many months. More than $60 million in relief funds were sent to Guam over the following years to aid <b>in</b> <b>rehabilitation.</b> Though the storm was devastating, it spurred new building codes and a revitalized economy.|$|E

5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing <b>in</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United's {{starting}} right-winger {{from the}} 2008 final, Owen Hargreaves, missed the match {{as he was}} still <b>in</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> after a double knee operation to cure his tendinitis problems that had seen him play little part in the 2008–09 Champions League campaign. It had been expected that defender Wes Brown would also miss the match after suffering a recurrence of a foot injury, but he returned to training quicker than expected and was involved in United's match against Hull City on 24 May, although {{he picked up a}} slight knock during the game. Rio Ferdinand was also a doubt following a calf injury that has kept him out of the United side since the semi-final second leg against Arsenal; Alex Ferguson had said that Ferdinand might not start in Rome if he was not fit to play against Hull, but he later admitted that Ferdinand was on course to recover in time to play in the match. Second-choice goalkeeper Ben Foster also missed the match after requiring surgery to repair a ruptured ligament in his right thumb in May 2009. On the other hand, following John O'Shea's winning goal in Manchester United's semi-final first leg victory over Arsenal, United manager Alex Ferguson suggested that the Irish utility player would be guaranteed a place in the starting line-up were United to reach the final. O'Shea's place in the team was confirmed at Manchester United's media day the week before the final. South Korean midfielder Park Ji-sung was also promised a place in the team after he missed the 2008 final, finally making him the first Asian to appear in a European Cup final. Cristiano Ronaldo suffered a slight injury scare in training the night before the final, requiring a bandage on his lower right leg, but he was eventually fit enough to play in the match.|$|E
