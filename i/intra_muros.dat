40|$|Studying Bobbio’s cathedral – a recently-established {{institution}} {{when compared}} to the wellknowm monastery of Saint Columbanus and retaining a secondary role in administering pastoral care to the community – poses a series of difficulties to any research aiming at reconstructing its century-old library. Such a study in fact, is an absolute novelty {{when compared to}} the literature which has hitherto been produced. The first part of the paper provides a codicological, paleographic, philological and textual study of the surviving attestations, which have mostly been ignored and are preserved in a surprisingly unexplored institution: Bobbio’s Archivi Storici Diocesani. Thus, also thanks to invaluable inventories, the number of the armaria originally found in the sacristy, as well as a list of the volumes destined to the canons’ study, can be reconstructed. At least eleven ascriptions can be dated with certainty to the 14 th- 18 th century. During these later centuries certain peculiar customs persevered, such as the celebration of Saint Columbanus, and a series of processions which took place <b>intra</b> et extra <b>muros,</b> with stationes in those places of worship which were of most significance to Bobbio’s ecclesiastical and devotional history...|$|R
40|$|For many years, the {{territory}} along {{the course of}} the Crni Timok river in northeast Serbia was not presented as an interesting area for early Neolithic excavation. However, recent inspection of older unpublished data, with newer reconnaissance, has shed new light on this period of prehistory. A larger number of sites have been discovered with similar topographical positions on the edges/rims of large areas or on ridges above river courses. Thanks to cooperation between the geographical project TOPOI from Berlin and the Archaeological Institute in Belgrade, work has begun on the production of a digital »archaeological model of probability« (ARM), which will improve reconnaissance of this region. Alongside the only systematic excavation/investigation of settlements in Kučajna, 16 more localities have been confirmed, situated in the area between the Roman imperial palace of Felix Romuiana in the south and Bor in the north. They are located at the following sites: Cerova Faca and Dubrava in Brestovac; Kot 1 and 2, Punđilov potok (Punđil’s stream) in Metovnica; La Bunar in Šarbanovac; Smolnica, Abri above Lazareve pećine (Lazarus’ cave), Donja Stopanja (Lower Stopanja) Kobila in Zlot. In the area around Felix Romuliana several settlements have been discovered: in sectors <b>Intra</b> and Extra <b>muros,</b> Kravarnik, Varzari, Petronj 2, sites between Magura and Rimski majdan (Roman mine) and Višicina Bašta. From the examination of finds discovered at these sites it can be concluded that on {{the territory}} along {{the course of the}} River Timok the population of the Starčevo-Kereš-Kriš cultural complex was relatively well established during the early Neolithic period. The Neolithic occupation of the region had proceeded from the Đerdap gorge in the north and Sićevačka, Svrljiška and Trgoviška gorges in the south, towards the course of the River Timok i. e. the central part of north-east Serbia. The Mesolithic populations had gradually accepted the production of food. Utilizing the optimal climate and fertile soil, they improved their husbandry through new agricultural methods and the better domestication of animals. This experimental process demanded successive migrations, which impoverished the quality of soil and the seasonal movements of animals that needed to be tamed. By analysis of the topographical and geomorphologic character of this terrain, early Neolithic settlements can be described as being agricultural-livestock husbandry and livestock husbandry-hunting based. The first settlements were located on gently inclined terrains relatively close to water sources, at altitudes of 180 to 300 m. The second category of settlements were formed on uplands, offering a better view of the terrain, 230 to over 450 metres above sea level. These were probably short-term or seasonal settlements since such territories were usually unsuitable for habitation during the winter months. The poor geomorphology of the land, the magma-rock substratum and ill-drained soil, in combination with primitive agriculture, guaranteed greater soil erosion, which would destroy the economic worth of the soil. With the disappearance of the early- Neolithic population from this region, human habitation did not reoccur until several millennia later, during the middle Bronze age...|$|R

40|$|Le Périphérique is a 35. 04 kms long {{inner ring}} road built around Paris {{following}} {{the line of the}} former defensive wall demolished in 1929. Ever since it opened in 1973 there have been attempts to reduce its physical impact on the landscape. It is generally taken as marking the administrative boundary of the city. At 50 km/h it takes 26 minutes to complete a full circle, the inside of which is always marked by red distance markers, the outer side by blue. This highly visual and strongly physical boundary has been seen as having a profound impact on the psychology of those living either side: There are 2. 2 million people <b>intra</b> <b>muros</b> (Parisiens) and 9. 6 million extra muros (banlieusards.) The former perceived as glamorous, the latter peripheral. The road has featured in film and literature as symbolising a divide between two worlds, {{and at the same time}} being a world of its own. This research explores the struggle for identity at this ‘periphery’ of Paris, the spatial manifestation of which begs the question: are you in Paris or not? The research charts a contemporary battle at the wall of Paris where the defence is being ‘breached’ by those outside who do not want to be seen as on the periphery and so want the symbolism of Paris extended beyond the wall; whilst at the same time the wall is ‘repaired’ or even ‘rebuilt’ by those who want to remain separate and not Parisian. Symbols, colours, signs, and material particular to one side or the other of this identity clash are the ordnance of this battle. In the case of Paris the struggle to assert identity is played both consciously and subconsciously. The research takes a deep mapping approach to understanding the periphery, drawing upon the work of William Least Heat-Moon as well as some of the more psychogeographical thinking of from Benjamin to Sinclair. The field work was carried out in the communes of St Mandé and Montreuil The findings suggest that Paris exhibits an ‘inverted periphery’ in which the walls of a city not seeking to extend its boundaries are being ‘attacked’ by those outside who emulate its imagery and so bring <b>intra</b> <b>muros</b> symbolism to their territory. Yet at the same time there is an institutional drive to reinforce the walls visually and retain extra muros identities.

40|$|During the {{excavations}} of {{the site}} of rue de Dinant in the historic centre of Brussels (Belgium), remains of the first city wall dating from the 13 th century have been discovered. <b>Intra</b> <b>muros</b> thick dark sediment units predating this wall are observed. These dark units are among the oldest occupation traces so far encountered in this higher, eastern, part of the historic centre of Brussels. In order to characterise them, and to understand the human activities and natural processes behind their formation, an interdisciplinary research, integrating archaeopedology and phytolith study, has been undertaken. This approach permitted us to identify a range of natural and cultural processes leading {{to the formation of}} these dark layers, and to characterise different activities. Remains of a hearth, old plough land (cropfields) and grassland have been identified, all activities referring to a rural landscape organisation. Later on, the area changes into an enormous silt extraction area, whereby Dark Earth is thrown into the dug pits.

Steep slopes, a complex network of narrow paved streets, dead-ends, small glades and picturesque squares compose the road system. These characteristics cause unfavorable travel conditions for pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles. The findings of the research show that the improvement of infrastructure for pedestrians, the development of a dense public transport network connecting the district with the city centre, the improvement of the urban landscape and the preservation and enhancement of its spatial features are the main priorities. The operation of the new bus line has to meet the expectations of the residents and serve the mobility needs of the area.
