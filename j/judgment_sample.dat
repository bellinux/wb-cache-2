40|$|Background To {{improve the}} {{information}} position {{of health care}} consumers and to facilitate decision-making behavior in health the Dutch ministry of Health commissioned the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment to develop, host and manage a public national health and care portal (www. kiesbeter. nl) on the Internet. The portal is used by over 4 million visitors in 2010. Among them, an increasing amount of patients that use the portal for information and decision making on medical issues, healthy living, health care providers and other topics. Objective First objective is to examine what usability aspects of the portal kiesBeter. nl matter for chronic patients and their informal carers with regard to information seeking, self-management, decision making, on line health information and other variables. Second objective is to make evidence-based practical recommendations for usability improvement. Methods An innovative combination of techniques (semi-structured interviews; eHealth Literacy scale; scenario-based study using think-aloud protocol and screen capture software; focus group) is used to study usability and on line information seeking behavior in a non random <b>judgment</b> <b>sample</b> of three groups of patients (N = 21) with long-term medical conditions (arthritis, asthma and diabetes). Results The search strategy mostly used (65 %) by the relatively well-educated subjects is ‘orienteering’. Users with long-term conditions and their carers expect tailored support from a national health portal, to help them navigate, search and find the detailed information they need. They encounter serious problems with these usability issues {{some of which are}} disease-specific. Patients indicate a need for personalized information. They report low impact on self-management and decision making. Overall judgment of usability is rated 7 on a Likert type 0 – 10 scale. Based on the outcomes recommendations could be formulated. These have led to major adaptations to improve usability. Limitations A non-representative composition of a small non random <b>judgment</b> <b>sample</b> does not permit generalization to other populations and cognitive bias cannot be quantified. However if mixed methods are applied valid conclusions can be drawn with regard to usability issue...|$|E

Differentiating the products, which are getting more similar today, becomes more difficult for the firms. In differentiating the products emotional factors come to the forefront. If the characteristics of the product are subjective and difficult to evaluate, consumers start to trust brand personality. The importance of brand personality is increasing nowadays. The reason is that brand personality increases the trust and loyalty of the consumers for the brand by affecting costumers’ preferences and uses. Pragmatic and personality factors have determinative effects on the formation of consumers’ attitude toward product and brand.

Due to the heterogeneity of actors and contexts involved in service innovation, the social dimension appears to be important, even if not adequately analyzed until now. In this paper we adopt social construction theories as a lens to explore the relationship between service innovation and value co-creation in a multi-stakeholder setting. In particular, we focus on the role of sense-making and boundary objects in enabling service innovation through resource integration. Design/Methodology/Approach Close to relativist epistemology, this study is the outcome of contextual knowledge. An interactive, qualitative, multi-case-study approach is applied to gain insights into the investigated phenomena. We studied service innovation in practice within networks of the service system. We deepened the role of social context and social structures affecting and being affected by value-enabling innovation. In this paper, findings concern a <b>judgment</b> <b>sample</b> formed by ten cases operating in the food market Findings In a multi-stakeholder system service innovation takes place through networked resource integration, where the resources to be integrated can be cultural, social, collective, and linked to live contextual experiences.

The empirical results and theoretical literature are examined to facilitate {{a better understanding of the}} borrower-specific financial constraints preventing access to finance for start-ups by youth entrepreneurs. These learnings contributed to the body of knowledge relating to entrepreneurship development in South Africa. The literature review revealed that although youth entrepreneurial activity is vital to sustained economic growth, access to finance is the challenge that negatively impacts youth entrepreneurial activity globally. More specifically, the literature indicates that borrower-specific factors to a large extent prevent youth entrepreneurs from accessing finance for their start-ups. The borrower-specific financial constraints are described. During this research, data was obtained by way of a <b>judgment</b> <b>sample</b> using a structured questionnaire consisting of 40 questions. A total of 110 useable questionnaires were returned. The findings of the study reveal that there are no significant differences for respondents in relation to factors for personal savings, business acumen and credibility differences. There are significant differences to certain factors for borrower-specific financial constraints, such as the intention to commence business start-up, gender and the educational level of respondents in relation to their attempt to access finance. Finally, significant learnings from the research are that the poor attitude of black youth towards saving are similar to youth reviewed in the literature, and the culture of South African black youth towards entrepreneurship has improved.

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this study {{completed}} in 1999 was to create an accurate, documented description of the experiences of nine students, three faculty members and two administrators in higher education in Chile during the military government 1973 - 1990. A qualitative approach was selected as the most appropriate methodology to' complete the study. A variety of methods and data collection strategies were used. The major data collection strategies were interviews and reviewing of primary and secondary written sources. The interviews were used to collect evidence concerning interviewees' experiences, as well as their attitudes, and perceptions regarding the events that occurred in higher education during the rule of the military government 1973 - 1990. The researcher decided to use a <b>judgment</b> <b>sample</b> of interviewees from the population based on their knowledge about the topic and their willingness to share their knowledge and experiences. Geographical representation, position within the institutions, kind of institution represented, and gender were major the considerations at the moment of selecting the sample too. Thanks to the U. S. A. Freedom of Information Act, which established an effective statutory right to access by any person or organization to federal government information, the researcher found official information that allowed for triangulation of evidence. The findings showed that the changes the military government implemented through their modernization of the educational system did not follow the historical trend of educational development in Chile. Furthermore, under the military government, policymaking in higher education was circumscribed to autocratic arenas, which usually coincided with government policy. Education was utilized to serve the purpose of the government. The educational system 1973 - 1990 failed to serve those with special needs. Free-market policies profoundly transformed education from a right available to all, to a commodity available in varying quantity and quality according to purchasing power of individuals. The impact of military government on higher education during the military rule was notorious and huge. Even though they were destructive in some aspects the military government did good things for the educational system. The issue in discussion is the price that was paid.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were: (a) to identify which of four competing theories best accounted for self help as a learned outcome of chronic illness experience, and (b) to generate a Self Help Model {{that could be used to}} explicate self help as a learned response to chronic illness. The concepts of severity of chronic illness, intimate dependency reinforcers, self induced dependency reinforcers, cue outcome independence reinforcers, enabling skill, self help and life quality were specified in a causal format that allowed a competitive test of four different theories. The theories tested were instrumental passivity theory, self induced dependency theory, an adaptation of learned helplessness theory and learned resourcefulness theory. The study utilized a causal modeling design to assess a five stage model. A <b>judgment</b> <b>sample</b> of 786 individuals having a diagnosis of arthritis or an arthritis related condition were mailed questionnaires. Two hundred seventy-eight subjects responded, a 36 percent return rate. Seven scales using a visual analogue response format indexed the theoretical concepts. Reliability and validity estimates were conducted to assess psychometric properties of the instruments. Model parameters were estimated using multiple regression statistical techniques. Residual analysis was conducted to estimate violations of the causal model and statistical assumptions. Factors from one theory, the learned resourcefulness theory, emerged as more credible than factors from any single other theory. However, the data did evidence factors from other theories that were significant. Self induced sick role reinforcers and cue outcome independence reinforcers were found to slightly reduce perception of enabling skill (B = -. 31 and B = -. 12, respectively; R² =. 11). Intimate dependency reinforcers and cue outcome independence reinforcers were found to slightly reduce perception of self help (B = -. 34 and B = -. 24, respectively; R² =. 19). These factors helped to identify environmental and intra-person contingencies that led to reduction in self help. The learned resourcefulness factor, enabling skill, demonstrated the mediating skills that worked to enhance self help (B =. 44; R² =. 29). The Self Help Model generated to explicate self help as a learned response to chronic illness explained 50 percent of the variance in perceived self help. Self help had a direct positive impact on life quality (B =. 61; R² =. 46). By knowing the factors influencing a patient’s self help response to chronic illness experience, the nurse is better able to plan more effective self help promoting interventions for individuals, or groups of patients.
