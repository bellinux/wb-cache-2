5|$|As {{part of her}} {{preparation}} for entering the studio, Bush toured pubs with the KT Bush Band. However, for her début album, The Kick Inside (1978), she was persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> had brought her bandmates back on board. Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin, unlike on later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as the balalaika and didgeridoo. Stuart Elliott played some of the drums and would become her main drummer on subsequent albums.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Hammond married Dorothy Lister, the {{daughter}} of a Yorkshire textile merchant, in a highly publicised ceremony at a parish church in Bingley. They met at a cricket match in 1927 but spent little time together before the wedding, having little in common. When married, they rarely communicated or got on well. Acquaintances believed Hammond treated her badly, particularly once her father lost nearly everything in the Depression, causing them financial worry. She remained loyal, but their relations gradually broke down, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> sailed to South Africa, joining Hammond on tour in 1939 in an attempt to save the marriage. By that time, he was already seeing his future second wife, Sybil Ness-Harvey, a former beauty queen whom he had met while on tour.|$|E
25|$|Out of {{economic}} necessity, Falkenstein inventively used inexpensive nontraditional materials for her artwork, including wooden logs, stovepipe wire, and lead bars. She used stovepipe wire, in particular, in innovative ways, {{and continued to}} do so <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> was able to afford other materials. The large, airy forms constructed of this material became part of her famous style.|$|E

25|$|He {{committed}} suicide, dying by gas asphyxiation, on March 8, 1916 in {{his room}} in New York City.

When he tried to have her paroled from Bedford Reformatory by proposing marriage, she rejected him.|$|E
25|$|Cooperation {{provides}} survival benefits; multiple-foundress {{groups are}} more likely to survive to produce offspring than are single-foundress groups, and individual foundresses in multiple-foundress colonies are less likely to disappear before worker emergence than foundresses nesting alone. Therefore, association provides significant productivity and survival advantages for cooperating foundresses. Cooperation provides survival benefits only if individual foundresses on a multiple-foundress nest have a greater chance of survival than individuals that found nests alone or the foundress' contribution to the nest is preserved <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> leaves.|$|E
25|$|Hills {{supported}} {{herself in}} part with commercial artwork, painting watercolors for greeting cards and calendars (especially for Louis Prang), drawing patterns for needlework, and decorating pottery. Her 1897 calendar Dream Roses—which featured Art Nouveau–inspired images of young women surrounded by masses of flowers—was particularly well received. She also sold illustrations to the children's magazine St. Nicholas and illustrated children's books such as an 1889 edition of Kate Douglas Wiggin's The Birds' Christmas Carol and Anna M. Pratt's Flower Folk. She continued this work <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> was routinely selling out her exhibitions of pastels and watercolors and gaining commissions for her miniatures.|$|E
25|$|The play's {{lead role}} is Cornelia Van Gorder, {{played in the}} first {{production}} by Effie Ellsler. Despite The Bat unusually long run, Ellsler appeared in almost every performance (including the <b>evening</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> heard about her husband's death); she left the part only briefly, after collapsing onstage during the production's final week. The Bat was her last Broadway role.|$|R

25|$|Some of her wealthy friends contributed {{often to}} her {{financial}} needs, such as Doane, Sankey, and Phoebe Knapp, although she still tended to give generously to those whom she saw as less fortunate than herself. Her longtime publisher The Biglow and Main Company paid her a small stipend of $8 each week {{in recognition of}} her contributions to their business over the years, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> submitted fewer lyrics to them. However, Knapp and others believed that Biglow and Main had made enormous profits because of Crosby without compensating her adequately for her contributions, and {{that she should be}} living more comfortably in her advanced years.|$|E
25|$|In 1536 Lady Kingston {{is said to}} {{have played}} a role in Mary Tudor's {{reconciliation}} with her father, and in his life of Mary Tudor, historian David Loades states that Lady Kingston had charge of a joint household for Henry VIII's daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, from March 1538 until April 1539. A letter from her to Thomas Wriothesley on 3 January 1538 advises of Mary's illness ('My Lady's Grace has been sick ever since Christmas'). <b>Even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> was discharged from that position, Lady Kingston's continuing relationship with the King's elder daughter is attested to by gifts from her listed in Mary Tudor's privy purse accounts, including gifts of £4 in May 1540 and a gold spoon in January 1544.|$|E
25|$|It was Carlock {{who gave}} Grandin {{the idea to}} build herself a 'hug box' (referred to as a 'squeeze machine' by Grandin) when she {{returned}} from her aunt's farm in Arizona in her {{senior year of high}} school. With Carlock's assistance, Grandin built her 'squeeze machine' at the age of 18 when she was still attending Mountain Country School. Carlock's supportive role in Grandin's life continued <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> left Mountain Country School. For example, when Grandin was facing criticism for her 'squeeze machine' at Franklin Pierce College, it was Carlock who suggested that Grandin undertake scientific experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the device. It was his constant guidance to Grandin to refocus her rigid obsessions with the 'squeeze machine' into a productive assignment that allowed this study undertaken by Grandin to be subsequently widely cited as evidence of Grandin's resourcefulness.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 February 1824 Fame {{caught fire}} about 50 miles {{south-west}} of Bencoolen in the <b>evening</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> had left there for England. A fire started when a careless steward carrying a candle accidentally ignited fumes while drawing brandy from a cask in a storeroom. Fortunately all aboard {{were able to}} leave the ship in two boats before the fire reached the magazine, which exploded. Sir Stamford Raffles (former Governor-General of Bencoolen (1817–1822)), and Lady Raffles were among the passengers who were rescued.|$|R
60|$|When {{they got}} home Gwendolen {{declared}} {{that she would not}} dine. She was tired, and would come down in the <b>evening</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> had taken some rest. The probability that her uncle would hear what had passed did not trouble her. She was convinced that whatever he might say would be on the side of her accepting Grandcourt, and she wished to accept him if she could.

25|$|Dev {{constantly}} takes Paro's {{love and}} affection for granted. He grows up to be arrogant and lazy, which causes his father {{to send him to}} London to complete his education. While separated by distance, Paro and Dev's youthful love only blossoms more, despite Dev becoming increasingly more egotistical and entitled. After finishing his studies, Dev returns to Chandigarh and meets Paro, and they rekindle their romance. After some time, Dev overhears scandalous rumours about Paro concerning her reputation and sexual history, which he immediately believes. Paro is shocked to see Dev's chauvinist attitude towards her, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> claims innocence. Dev hypocritically passes judgement on Paro and does not approve {{of the things that he}} has heard. Paro turns her back on him when she hears him insult her and rashly agrees to marry a man of her parents' choice. On her wedding day, Dev learns that the rumors were false but his ego doesn't let him accept his mistake, and he lets Paro marry someone else.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in mid-1908, Mary had {{an affair}} with Gilbert Cannan (who was twenty years younger than her and an {{associate}} of Barrie's in his anti-censorship activities), including a visit together to Black Lake Cottage, known only to the house staff. When Barrie learned of the affair in July 1909, he demanded that she end it, but she refused. To avoid the scandal of divorce, he offered a legal separation if she would agree not to see Cannan any more, but she still refused. Barrie sued for divorce on the grounds of infidelity– the divorce was granted in October 1909. Knowing how painful the divorce was for him, some of Barrie's friends wrote to a number of newspaper editors asking them not to publish the story. In the event, only three newspapers did. Barrie continued to support Mary financially <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> married Cannan, by giving her an annual allowance which was handed over at a private dinner held on her and Barrie's wedding anniversary.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} honor is another social {{characteristic}} Holý identifies as being related to Middle Eastern cousin marriage. The {{honor of the}} males surrounding a woman is sullied in many societies when she misbehaves or when she is attacked. In societies like Europe that place greater value on affinal relations, responsibility for a married woman rests with both her husband's family and her own. In the Middle East the situation is different in that primary responsibility continues to rest with the woman's own family <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> is married. Her agnates therefore cannot release her from control upon marriage due to the risk to their honor. They and not the husband {{may be responsible for}} killing her, or sometimes her lover, if she commits adultery. Similar rules may apply in case of the payment if she is killed and for the inheritance of her property if she has no male heirs. Her natal family may continue supporting her even against her husband. This is an idealized system: some Middle Eastern societies do mix it with other systems that assign more responsibility to the husband's family.|$|E

[...] She takes him to the {{abandoned}} dance hall. Without exchanging a word, she just allows him to mount her, but he soon stops and rolls aside (apparently the victim of premature ejaculation). Not giving up, she fellates him. She then mounts him herself {{while at the same}} time giving him a handjob, moving in spasms and moaning loudly as she finally gains her long sought orgasm.|$|R
5000|$|After a brief initial attraction, Pete has a poor {{relationship}} with H.G. Wells, apparently never fully trusting her <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she’s</b> reinstated as a Warehouse agent in season 2. In season 3 episode 5, Pete {{has the most}} adverse reaction {{to the arrival of}} the H.G. hologram, using most of the opportunities he can to belittle her. Despite Myka's efforts to stop this, it is only {{at the end of the}} episode that he starts to mellow somewhat on H.G. Pete finally embraces H.G. (literally) in the season 3 finale after H.G. demonstrates through her actions that her commitment to the good of the Warehouse is genuine.|$|R
25|$|Another {{behavior}} {{observed in}} D. media workers is gastral vibration. This is observed in workers of many Dolichovespula and Vespula species. Workers tap their gaster rapidly {{up and down}} onto the comb of the nest and this is associated with feeding of larvae. The behavior typically occurs while wasps are walking on the comb and ceases after feeding each larvae {{a small amount of}} flesh and then resumes before feeding the next larvae. A behavior that appears to be homologous to this is observed in the foundresses queen and is called tapping. Queens have been observed tapping mid or hind legs on the comb after returning with prey. These taps can last a few seconds to a couple minutes and are loud enough to be heard outside of the nest. This signal is believed to function {{in the same way as}} gastral vibration in workers and is to signal to the larvae when it is time to feed. Sometimes this tapping or vibration occurs even when there is no pellet to feed the larvae and it is speculated that this corresponds to the feeding of liquids, but this has not been confirmed. Tapping continues in the queen <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> has ceased foraging when she feeding larvae pellets that she receives from the workers. This supports the idea that it is involved in signaling larvae during feeding.|$|E
25|$|Once {{a devoted}} and bright faerie, she {{questioned}} the King {{as to why}} a faerie like herself was not permitted to visit him as often and freely as Oran. The King responds by saying that she and Oran are different by birth, and faery as lowly as Seraphina can not possibly compare herself with Oran. This left Seraphina jealous and determine to best Oran, {{no matter what it}} took, and constantly strove towards what ever goal Oran was headed to. She tricks Oran into staying on Earth by ordering Goodfellow to lead Sindo to the bathing spring, then altering the barrier that was supposed to hide them from humans so that Oran's gown was exposed for stealing. Seraphina uses the opportunity to achieve her ambitions and become the Queen of Avalon. Unfortunately, she is rejected again and again by the King, who constantly reminds Seraphina that no matter how hard she works, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> becomes a 1st class faerie, she will never compare to Oran because Seraphina simply tries too hard to be something Oran comes by naturally. When Pain and Fanta arrive in Avalon, Seraphina appears again to eliminate Pain only to find that he is powerful enough to detect her spells with ease. Oreadia eventually masterminds Seraphina's downfall by using Fanta, Pain, and Syndra; Seraphina is punished for her attempt to get rid of Oreadia and reborn as a human on earth who would remember her heavenly origins only when she turned fifteen.|$|E

From the Nazi perspective, this was Rassenschande, a racial pollution, a crime against the German blood. The heroine's suicide is a proper response of a German to such a tragedy.|$|E

The man was between 25 and 30 years of age and slightly overweight. Martin's friends and family called the police and started a search, but her disappearance was difficult to publicize since the local newspapers were on strike.|$|R

She eventually decided that the reason she didn't like the book was her own selfishness in seeking to fulfill her own desires rather than leaving her desires for God to work out. She then read the book again, and wrote that God used her reading of it to make her thankful for her time as a single person. She also wrote that she found the book to be [...] "mostly about letting God's love overflow into all areas of your life rather than tales of perfect Christian couples." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly before Naomi's first {{scenes were}} broadcast, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy {{reported}} that she would test one of the show's established relationships by setting her sights on a married man. Cast member Ryan Moloney, who plays Toadfish Rebecchi, previously hinted that his character might be tempted by another woman and it was later confirmed that Naomi would develop feelings for Toadie. The storyline began shortly after Toadie hired Naomi to be his new personal assistant at his law office. While Naomi ran the office well, Toadie's wife, Sonya (Eve Morey) did not fully trust her, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> helped Sonya out with a business problem. Naomi later convinced Toadie that Sonya would be a liability if she attended a meeting with some important clients with him, and then made sure that Sonya was busy when the meeting took place. Sheila, noticing her daughter's [...] "intimate" [...] celebrations with Toadie at the office, then accused her of trying to seduce another married man.
