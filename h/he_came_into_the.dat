5|$|Alec Coxon took match {{figures of}} 4/113 for Yorkshire against Australia, taking four middle-order wickets, and scored 21 and 16 not {{out in the}} middle-order. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> team as an all-rounder, even though his {{performances}} {{during the rest of}} the English season had been mediocre; he had a batting average of 20.25 for the summer and took only ten wickets in seven matches prior to the county fixture against Australia. Bowes saw him as an attacking bowler compatible with Robins's strategic thinking.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{started his}} 2010 {{season at the}} AAMI Kooyong Classic in Melbourne, Australia with a win over Croatian world No. 24 Ivan Ljubičić. On 11 January, he moved up to a career high world No. 4. He was {{scheduled}} to face Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on day 2 of the Kooyong Classic exhibition tournament, but withdrew due to a wrist injury. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 2010 Australian Open with the injury not healed, {{and was forced to}} take a month off after the event. In the fourth round, he fell to eventual semifinalist Marin Čilić.|$|E
5|$|Felipe Massa {{tried to}} make up places after his pit lane-start, but was caught in midfield battles. He went into the pit lane {{simultaneously}} with Felipe Nasr in front and Pastor Maldonado behind him. A swift stop by the Lotus pit crew meant that Maldonado {{was able to get}} out ahead and gain two positions. Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson was running eighth when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit lane on lap 26. A 27-second pit stop due to problems with the front left tyre meant that he fell out of reach for a points finish. Carlos Sainz Jr. retired from the race right after exiting pit lane on lap 30, due to an issue with his front left wheel. His Toro Rosso teammate Max Verstappen joined him on the sidelines on lap 34 due to an electrical failure.|$|E

5|$|While {{the rain}} had stopped come race time, the track was still wet and {{slippery}} and all drivers opted to start on intermediate tyres. Hamilton got away better at the start, entering the first corner alongside pole-sitter Rosberg and, by forcing the German wide, took the lead exiting turn one. Getting off track saw Rosberg lose additional positions, running fifth behind Hamilton, Kvyat, Ricciardo and Pérez. Further back, a collision involved Alonso, Massa, the two Sauber cars of Ericsson and Nasr as well as Bottas, who made a pit stop after the first lap, as did Nasr, who was the first to fit slick tyres, as the track was starting to dry. Will Stevens was touched from behind by teammate Alexander Rossi, breaking his rear wing and forcing him to retire. Having started {{from the back of the}} grid, Carlos Sainz profited from the incidents and was up to tenth by the end of the first lap. While Rosberg soon took back fourth from Pérez, Hamilton in front came under pressure from Kvyat, with the Red Bull drivers running fast in the damp conditions. With Kvyat just half a second behind the championship leader, a virtual safety car period was declared on lap five to clear the debris from the first corner incident. On lap 7, Valtteri Bottas retired with a damper failure caused by the turn one contact. When the virtual safety car ended on lap 8, Rosberg made an immediate move on Ricciardo to move into third, overtaking Kvyat for second on the same lap. Romain Grosjean became another victim of the accident on lap one, when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit lane for a second time on lap 12 and retired. By the same time, Sebastian Vettel had moved up into sixth place from thirteenth on the grid. Up front, Kvyat went wide while trying to overtake Rosberg, allowing teammate Ricciardo through into third; Ricciardo in turn made a successful manoeuvre on Rosberg to move up into second.|$|E

25|$|I {{should be}} {{inclined}} to give first place among bowlers on both sides to Trueman. This gallant soul broke through in both innings.

25|$|It {{seemed that}} no one in the Channel Nine box could make a comment about him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It just seemed kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some seemed happy when he was out. But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> captaincy without playing a game. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he was pretty much everything he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E

25|$|Hershiser {{was called}} up to the Dodgers {{for the first time}} on September 1, 1983, and made his debut the same day, against the Montreal Expos. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game in the seventh inning and retired all three batters he faced on two ground outs and a strikeout (of Tim Wallach). However, in his second inning of work he allowed a double and a single for a run and was {{promptly}} taken out of the game. In eight appearances that month, he had an ERA of 3.38.|$|E
25|$|Following his suspension, Somma was {{available}} {{to return to the}} Leeds side against Millwall, and duly scored twice on his league debut after coming on as a 75th-minute substitute, as Leeds won 3–1. Somma claimed after his debut that he could replace Jermaine Beckford and score the goals the departed hitman previously scored for Leeds. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> starting line-up for the following match against Leicester City in the League Cup, scoring his third goal in two games. In his fourth game of the season, he scored his fourth goal of the season in the 5–2 defeat against Barnsley, with Somma scoring a late consolation goal for Leeds.|$|E

Against Sri Lanka in the Super Eight stage he produced his best figures in an ODI match, taking the wickets of Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara in his spell of 4–50. After {{his successful}} bowling figures against Sri Lanka, he was picked for the match against Australia. Despite being England's most expensive bowler in that match, he was picked for the following match against Bangladesh, in which he took 3 wickets for 27 runs. England won and Mahmood was awarded Man of the Match.|$|E

25|$|Having {{achieved}} {{little success}} as an opening batsman at junior-level cricket, Ashwin dropped down {{the order and}} turned into an off break bowler. He made his first-class debut for Tamil Nadu in December 2006, and captained the team the following season. But {{it was not until}} the 2010 Indian Premier League in which he played for the Chennai Super Kings, that <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> limelight with his economical bowling and earned his maiden international call-up in the limited-overs formats in June 2010. He was the leading wicket-taker and player of the tournament of the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 in South Africa. He was also part of the Indian squad that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Later that year, he made his Test debut against West Indies and became the seventh Indian to take a five-wicket haul on Test debut. He took two five-wicket hauls and scored a century in that series and won the player of the series award.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, Lisch re-signed {{with the}} Wildcats for the 2010–11 NBL season. Lisch gladly put pen to paper after contemplating {{a move to}} Europe and being on the radar of several other NBL clubs. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 2010–11 season {{sporting}} a more muscular tone, having bulked up for his second season after spending countless hours running and working out in the weights room. Lisch scored in double figures in all but nine games during the regular season, as he scored over 20 points three times. The Wildcats were hit by numerous long-term injuries during the 2010–11 season that derailed their chances at defending their title. They finished the regular season in fourth place with a 16–12 record, and faced the first-placed New Zealand Breakers in the Semi Finals. Behind a 29-point effort, Lisch helped the Wildcats take Game 1 of the series in Auckland, before the Breakers came back to win Games 2 and 3. Lisch appeared in all 31 games for the Wildcats in 2010–11, averaging 13.5 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game. His strong season saw him share the Gordon Ellis Medal as the Perth Wildcats' MVP along with co-captain Shawn Redhage.|$|E
25|$|His next appearance, {{and first}} in 2009, came almost three months later, on 1 March {{in a league}} match against Slaven Belupo. After {{that he made a}} string of six {{consecutive}} appearances in the league, which ended with a match against Inter Zaprešić on 11 April. He made three more appearances {{before the end of the}} season, reaching a total number of 23 league appearances for the club, five of which he made an appearance as a substitute. He also started in all of the club's UEFA Cup matches. The club went on to win the double, and Ibáñez helped with 7 appearances in the Croatian Cup, also scoring a goal against Hrvatski dragovoljac in the second round of the competition. On 13 May in the first leg of the Cup finals against Hajduk Split <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> match as a late substitute, while he failed to make an appearance in the second leg a fortnight later. He made a total of 37 appearances throughout his first season with the club, scored two goals and made one assist. In the post-season break he picked up an injury which then ruled him out for three months.|$|E
