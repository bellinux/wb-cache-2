500|$|The 1972 {{election}} {{returned a}} Liberal minority government and elected {{the greatest number}} of NDP MPs until the 1988 [...] "Free Trade" [...] election, and left the NDP holding the balance of power until 1974. The NDP propped up Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government in exchange for the implementation of NDP proposals such as the creation of Petro-Canada as a crown corporation. Lewis wanted to topple the government in a vote of no-confidence as early as possible, because he saw no strategic advantage to supporting the Trudeau government: he believed that Trudeau would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> if a program was well-received, and that the NDP would be vilified if it was unpopular.|$|E

Peter Debruge of Variety said McAdams played [...] "the most competent—and human—of Marvel’s window-dressing girlfriends," [...] while Gregory Ellwood of Indiewire remarked: [...] "It {{goes without saying}} that McAdams will never <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> she deserves for transforming the barely sketched out role of Strange’s former medical colleague Christine Palmer into a captivating three-dimensional character that feels like {{an integral part of the}} storyline even when she isn’t." [...] Also in 2016, McAdams narrated an audiobook version of L. M. Montgomery's novel Anne of Green Gables, released by Audible.|$|E
500|$|Although Gervais came up {{with the}} plot of the episode and wrote parts of it on his own, the whole writing team of The Simpsons worked on the script and pitched ideas, as is done with all episodes. Gervais has said in {{interviews}} that he thinks he received too much credit for writing the episode, claiming he merely sent his plot ideas, along with some written scenes, to Jean through email, and it was then the staff of the show that [...] "made it look like a Simpsons script." [...] He commented in a Dazed & Confused article that [...] "I'm going to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit,</b> but I think everyone in the industry knows it was a joint effort." [...] One of the scenes that Gervais wrote himself was Charles' love song for Marge, which later appeared on the 2007 soundtrack album [...]|$|E

2500|$|Some of {{the failure}} to shift to more {{productive}} agricultural products {{may be related to}} ignorance about the benefits of changing land use. [...] A second explanation is a lack of availability of credit, caused by the high rate of failure of banks in the Plains states. [...] Because banks failed in the Dust Bowl region at a higher rate than elsewhere, farmers could not <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> they needed to buy capital to shift crop production. In addition, profit margins in either animals or hay were still minimal, and farmers had little incentive in the beginning to change their crops.|$|E

Miller was critical of the New York club in particular:"When a club deliberately imports six or eight {{of the best players}} in Canada, feeds them like fighting cocks, keeps them with nothing to do from one week's end to another but play lacrosse, and then plays them against a team composed of business men who don't get a chance to practice more than three or four hours a week, I think it's about time to stop it ...

2500|$|Throughout this era, {{development}} of automotive technology was rapid, {{due in part}} to hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention.

Leaf springs were widely used for suspension, though many other systems were still in use, with angle steel taking over from armored wood as the frame material of choice. Transmissions and throttle controls were widely adopted, allowing a variety of cruising speeds, though vehicles generally still had discrete speed settings, rather than the infinitely variable system familiar in cars of later eras. Safety glass also made its debut, patented by John Wood in England in 1905. (It would not become standard equipment until 1926, on a Rickenbacker.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Gervais guest-starred in {{an episode}} of The Simpsons {{entitled}} [...] "Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife". He is the only British comic to write and star in a Simpsons episode. The episode was the highest rated in Sky One's history; it revolved around the angle that Gervais was the episode's sole writer (and the first guest star on the show to also receive a writing credit for the episode of his appearance). Gervais clarified {{the extent of his}} input in a joint interview (with Christopher Guest) for Dazed and Confused magazine (January 2006): [...] "No, all I did was put down a load of observations on an email and they made it look like a Simpsons script.

[...] The tour was controversial for its sexuality and portrayal of domestic violence, most notably within performances of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] and [...] "What About". Its advertisements, depicting Jackson in a transparent outfit with her nipple piercing and bikini partially visible, also drew media attention. Several publications refused to publish the ad, while billboards of the image caused traffic accidents in Europe. The tour's HBO broadcast received over 15 million viewers, surpassing the ratings of all four major networks. It won an Emmy Award for [...] "Outstanding Technical Direction/Camera/Video for a Special". The final date at Hawaii's Aloha Stadium became the most attended concert in the venue's history.

2500|$|Robert Hilburn of The Los Angeles Times favorably {{reviewed}} the tour, exclaiming [...] "There {{is so much}} of the ambition and glamour of a Broadway musical in Janet Jackson's new Velvet Rope Tour that it's only fitting that the concert program credits her as the show's creator and director." [...] Although [...] "those aren't terms normally employed in the pop-rock world", Hilburn applauded Jackson's credibility in portraying [...] "a dazzling package, complete with snappy choreography, a colorful array of costumes and often striking staging." [...] Hilburn observed [...] "there were several moments in the show when Jackson stepped beyond the production values and touched us in a way the best pop performers have done over the years." [...] Emphasis was placed on the [...] "playfulness of the fairy tale staging" [...] of [...] "Escapade", the [...] "artful musical stretch" [...] of [...] "Got 'Til It's Gone", and the intimacy of [...] "soul-searching" [...] ballad [...] "Special", adding [...] "Jackson has put a personal stamp on this show that humanizes not only the music but also the performer too." [...] Jackson's [...] "radiance and warmth" [...] was believed {{to be the result of}} [...] "her own new-found self esteem", overcoming some of the insecurities plaguing her since childhood. Upon the show's encore Jackson [...] "lingered, clinging to the thunderous applause" [...] in a way which [...] "demonstrated a personal vulnerability and warmth", considered its [...] "real breakthrough." [...] Hilburn stated [...] "the tour and album should go a long way toward helping Jackson finally <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> she deserves as an artist." [...] The tour's [...] "computer design-phase" [...] was considered [...] "a marvel of precision" [...] by Tom Moon of The Inquirer. Its [...] "eerie, robotic aura of a video game" [...] was thought to be complimented by pyrotechnics detonated [...] "At all the right, surprising moments", a troupe of [...] "lockstep" [...] dancers likened to [...] "a phalanx of marching insects", and [...] "stylized stage sets", ranging from [...] "a child's nursery to a swing-era street scene." [...] The show's lengthy [...] "high-concept medleys" [...] and [...] "power-as-aphrodisiac theme" [...] where analyzed to be commanding and accentuated her physical presence, ripping off her blouse with [...] "theatrical grandeur." [...] Additionally, Jackson's rapid [...] "clockwork" [...] movement was thought to be [...] "high price", declared as nearly mechanical in certain segments. Moon declared [...] "The audience cheered throughout the lavish production; the glossy, every-note-in-its-place music hardly mattered: This was Janet, the noted control freak.
