5|$|On May 7, 2006, on {{what would}} have been his 30th birthday, Murphy’s {{hometown}} dedicated the Michael P. Murphy Memorial Park; formerly Lake Ronkonkoma Park. The park contains a black granite wall dedicated to the men lost in Operation Red Wings, with each member’s name inscribed. A black <b>granite</b> <b>stone</b> embedded in the plaza bears the picture of Murphy and his Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{location}} of the Vijithapura fortress is uncertain. A village with the same name near the ancient Kalawewa reservoir {{may have been the}} place where the battle took place. There is an ancient temple here as well as a <b>granite</b> <b>stone</b> that locals believe to have been used by Dutthagamani's soldiers to sharpen their swords However, other historians and archaeologists believe that the location is close to Kaduruwela near Polonnaruwa, where the ruins of an ancient fortress have been found.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy, {{then the}} U.S. President, gave the {{graduation}} commencement address at Aztec Bowl {{in front of}} 40,000 people on June 6, 1963. Kennedy was given an honorary doctorate degree in law at the ceremony, making San Diego State the first in California to award an honorary doctorate degree. To commemorate his visit, the campus added his portrait to the campus library collection and a <b>granite</b> <b>stone</b> marker placed where his helicopter landed (California Historical Landmark #798). In April 2008, a plaque that commemorated his visit was stolen {{and has yet to}} be recovered. On May 29, 1964 Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at the Open Air Theater about proposed legislation in improving rights for African Americans.|$|E

5|$|King Charles's Castle is {{a ruined}} {{artillery}} fort overlooking New Grimsby harbour {{on the island}} of Tresco in the Isles of Scilly. Built between 1548 and 1551 to protect the islands from French attack, it would have held a battery of guns and an accompanying garrison, designed to prevent enemy vessels from entering the harbour. The castle is polygonal in design, constructed from <b>granite</b> <b>stone,</b> with the gun battery at the front, and a dining room, kitchen and living accommodation at the rear. An additional defensive earthwork was constructed around it during the 17th century. The design of the castle is unusual for the period, and is only seen elsewhere in blockhouses along the River Thames.|$|E

50|$|On the R748 {{road between}} Carnew and the Kilcavan Gap, {{there is a}} field with many <b>granite</b> <b>stones.</b> This land is in Kilcavan Upper and is privately owned today. This was once {{the site of an}} early {{religious}} settlement known as Kilcavan Church. Very little is known of this church, but it {{is believed to have been}} a circular shaped building (according to the 1838 Ordnance Survey map), and is also believed to have contained a cemetery. Today there is very little left of the Church except scattered <b>granite</b> <b>stones,</b> some resembling grave stones, others most likely church building material.|$|R
25|$|Tharreau's name {{is inscribed}} on the 11th column of the Arc de Triomphe, in Paris. There is also a <b>granite</b> <b>stone</b> at the {{cemetery}} {{in the village of}} Orvault, in the Loire-Atlantique department of France, on which is inscribed: To the memory of General of Division Baron Jean-Victor Tharreau, officer of the Legion of Honor, who died of wounds from the Battle of Moscow 7 September 1812.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{monuments to}} those who perished in the {{derailment}} and the subsequent fire that engulfed the cars. The first is {{at the site of}} the accident along the old road between Åby and Sandviken. The second is located at Norra kyrkogården, a cemetery in Norrköping.

25|$|Pollen {{analyses}} {{confirms the}} Iron Age as {{a period of}} intense deforestation in Galicia and Northern Portugal, with meadows and fields expanding {{at the expense of}} woodland. Using three main type of tools, ploughs, sickles and hoes, together with axes for woodcutting, the Castro inhabitants grew a number of cereals: (wheat, millet, possibly also rye) for baking bread, as well as oats and barley which they also used for beer production. They also grew beans, peas and cabbage, and flax for fabric and clothes production; other vegetables where collected: nettle, watercress. Large quantities of acorns have been found hoarded in most hill-forts, as they were used for bread production once toasted and crushed in <b>granite</b> <b>stone</b> mills.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} discuss decay {{patterns}} and susceptibility of granite types used in architectural works, the decay features of 39 monuments built with <b>granite</b> <b>stones</b> and presenting diverse architectural characteristics, {{date of construction}} and environmental characteristics (including exposition conditions, traffic intensity, etc.) are compared. Decay patterns of biotite-rich medium- to fine-grained (frequently porphyritic) <b>granite</b> <b>stones</b> are related to weathering inherited from the quarry (expressed by yellowing), {{to the presence of}} heterogeneous elements (enclaves and phenocrysts) and to grain size variations. Fine-grained leucogranitic stone decay is mainly controlled by tectonic foliation. The charac-teristics of stone application, including how and where stone was used, influence decay patterns by favouring salt pollution concentration, biological colonization and fixation of atmospheric pollutants. Erosive decay features (linked mainly to salt pollution) and stone coatings (linked to biological action and atmospheric and organic pollution) are wide-spread ecay forms that affect <b>granite</b> <b>stones</b> in Braga monuments. Braga (NW Portugal, Fig. 1) is located in the Central Iberian Zone of the Iberian Peninsula (Julivert et al. 1974). From the geological point of view the region is dominated by granitic rock...|$|R
5000|$|The {{class of}} 2002 {{began work on}} the Truth Walk project, which was {{completed}} in 2004. The project includes <b>granite</b> <b>stones</b> engraved with scriptures, located directly south of Shawnee Hall and north of the bison pedestal.|$|R

25|$|Rock art {{engravings}} {{found in}} Goa exhibit the earliest traces {{of human life}} in India. Goa, situated within the Shimoga-Goa Greenstone Belt in the Western Ghats (an area composed of metavolcanics, iron formations and ferruginous quartzite), yields evidence for Acheulean occupation. Rock art engravings (petroglyphs) are present on laterite platforms and granite boulders in Usgalimal near the west flowing Kushavati river and in Kajur. In Kajur, the rock engravings of animals, tectiforms and other designs in granite {{have been associated with}} what {{is considered to be a}} megalithic stone circle with a round <b>granite</b> <b>stone</b> in the centre. Petroglyphs, cones, stone-axe, and choppers dating to 10,000 years ago have been found in various locations in Goa, including Kazur, Mauxim, and the Mandovi-Zuari basin. Evidence of Palaeolithic life is visible at Dabolim, Adkon, Shigao, Fatorpa, Arli, Maulinguinim, Diwar, Sanguem, Pilerne, and Aquem-Margaon. Difficulty in carbon dating the laterite rock compounds poses a problem for determining the exact time period.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 work on {{conservation}} were begun: repavement; {{repair of}} joints; substitution of stonework and placement of tilework in the intermediary {{floor of the}} tower. Two years later, the watchtowers and accesses were repaired; repair of the granite masonry along the handrails and the walkways and staircase accesses, {{in addition to the}} Portuguese pavement stone. By 1983, the tower was in an advance state of degrade, resulting in studies by the Grupo da Pedra and laboratory analysis by INIC. In 1983, the DGMEN replaced the stone masonry with <b>granite</b> <b>stone</b> from primitive quarries in the town; washing and brushing of masonry; and the application of silicone on all facades. Between 1983 and 1984, further conservation work on the parapets occurred with the substitution of deteriorated stone and reconstitution of the foundations and base of the embattlements, with schist stonework, including repair of joints and cleaning. Work on the walls, staircases, placement of slabs and windows, landscaping of the surrounding areas, including the installation of electrical devices began in 1984. Consolidation of the walls continued between 1985 and 1987, with the shoring of the foundations; placement of new schist to reinforce and consolidate the foundations; leveling of the walls and application of schist masonry; cleaning of brush/vegetation, including the extraction of roots.|$|E

The stone was raised anew on the cemetery of the former church.|$|E
500|$|Runestone Sö 85 (...) is a runestone {{in style}} KB that {{measures}} [...] in height. The <b>granite</b> <b>stone</b> was discovered {{at a small}} brook, but in 1835 the runestone was destroyed. Some pieces were brought to Munkhammar and Mälhammar where they {{were used for the}} construction of fireplaces. [...] were brought to Västerby in 1855 in order to be protected by a fence, but when a scholarly enquiry took place in 1897, only four pieces remained. An association of local antiquarians arranged so that the four remaining parts could be reassembled at Västerby.|$|E

50|$|Some {{positions}} were buried under soil and landscaped with plants and trees.Camouflage {{in the form}} of paint, sprayed concrete and straw on wire mesh, and timber constructions were common. <b>Granite</b> <b>stones</b> were built into some concrete walls to give a natural stone finish.|$|R
5000|$|The {{structure}} {{is made of}} over 360 <b>granite</b> <b>stones,</b> indicative of the passage of one year. It was used for astronomical and meteorological observation, with equipment at the top used in the observation of changing weather {{and the movement of}} celestial bodies.|$|R
500|$|Work {{during the}} {{renovation}} included demolition and installation of new parapets and rustications; repair of wall cracks; removal, temporary storage, and numbering of approximately 1,000 large granite paving stones; installation of new waterproofing {{on the existing}} concrete structural deck of the plaza and the monuments stylobate; cleaning and repair of the <b>granite</b> <b>stone,</b> steps, and veneer; installation of a new exposed aggregate concrete walking surface around the Monument plaza; and replacing the existing sprinkler system and landscaping elements. [...] This repaired problems first identified in a 1939 structural inspection.|$|E
500|$|A {{recessed}} trench wall {{known as}} a ha-ha has been built to minimize the visual impact of a security barrier surrounding the monument. After the September 11 attacks and another unrelated terror threat at the monument, authorities had put up a circle of temporary Jersey barriers to prevent large motor vehicles from approaching. The unsightly barrier {{was replaced by a}} less-obtrusive low [...] <b>granite</b> <b>stone</b> wall that doubles as a seating bench and also incorporates lighting.
