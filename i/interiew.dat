5000|$|The writer John Harris {{asserts that}} Borenius {{was sent by}} the British (MI6) to Geneva in January 1941. The perilous journey was via Bristol (Whitchurch) to Lisbon (Sintra) by KLM DC3 and {{thereafter}} to Geneva via rail across Spain and Vichy France.The minute book of the Polish Relief Fund records Borenius' absence from mid January to mid March 1941. The diary of Ulrich von Hassell also records the trip and Borenius' meeting with Carl Jacob Burckhardt, then {{a leader of the}} International Red Cross. Harris also <b>interiewed</b> Borenius' son, Peter who told him that Claude Dansey had supplied a cyanide pill, 'the size of a golf ball'. The diary entry makes it clear that Borenius was there to impart the knowledge that Britain was still ready to talk peace, 'though not for much longer'. The key question, Harris argues is on whose authority was Borenius sent? In the original German diaries Von Hassell states that Borenius was sent by English 'stellen' and this is the key - who were the English 'stellen'? MI6, Royalty or was it merely a clever ruse? ...|$|R

World malaria report states that 88 l (9 l %) malaria deaths (WHO) 2006 occurred in Africa, among which 85 % were children under Eve years of age. Healthcare workers and the parent of gaunter plays major role to reduce the mortality of the children Objectives: To assess the knowledge of pharmaceutical personnel and prescribers on dispensing and practice respectively, to assess the knowledge of the mothers on the malaria and its effects and to assess the knowledge of the prescribers that was consulting in the pediatric the outpatient ward. Methodology: This was a cross-sectional-descriptive study involving visits to 200 private pharmacies (as simulate client) Temeke and Kinondoni districts. In addition, a total of 200 mothers of fathers of the affected paediatric were <b>interiewed</b> hospital at Amana hospital. Temeke Hospital and Mwananyamala hospital and dispensaries (Aviation and Kam) and health care centre. Results: one hundred and thirty the or (67 %) mothers fathers had moderate level of understanding the instructions given to thro; by the prescribers, while the remaining 66 (33 %) had low level of understanding. Total of 35 (69 %) mother/father had moderate knowledge regarding malaria, where as 2 (l %) showed high level of knowledge and the remaining 35 % showed low level of knowledge. 55 (36. 7 %l dispensers had low knowledge regarding antimalarial and the remaining had moderate level to knowledge. On the knowledge of the prescribers S out of 9 had moderate knowledge on prescribing practices. Dispensing of antimalarial to children less than five kilograms were considered unlike those children who were above five kilogram Conclusion; From the results, it shows that there is lack of good prescribing and dispensing, practices of malaria and it- management. Since malaria {{is one of the major}} killer disease in Tanzania, poor practices of healthcare workers can increase the mortality rate of children under the age of five years.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This research explores the potential of GCSE coursework to promote teaching and learning strategies that foster independent learning, critical thinking and creativity. Although ill-defined, these constructs are highly valued and often invoked {{as the basis for}} a high skills economy and for individuals to develop a capacity for lifelong learning. The broad aim of this research was to study how GCSE coursework could provide a framework for learning. Within this aim, specific objectives were to investigate: {{the extent to which the}} original qualities attributed to coursework are achieved in current practice; the extent to which coursework contributes to the development of skills associated with independent learning, critical thinking and creativity; the influence of the demands of assessment upon students' learning. In six case study schools, current practice in English and geography GCSE coursework was scrutinised and appraised; students' understanding of their organisation of, and approaches to, learning through coursework was probed; and how teaching and learning styles are influenced by the coursework assessment framework was examined. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with students who had taken their GCSEs in 2000, other teachers involved in English and geography GCSE coursework, and the parents of the students. Grounding the data collection and analysis in practice, the research team identified indicators and dimensions of the three constructs and developed case studies of organisation, approaches and outcomes of coursework. Main Topics : The dataset includes data collected from the semi-structured interviews described above. Students were <b>interiewed</b> twice (in Years 10 and 11), their parents during Year 11. Teacher researchers were also interviewed in the preliminary phases of the project, who in turn interviewed other teachers within both subject areas under investigation during Year 11. The interviews focused on perceptions and examples of framing and support, assessment, learning styles, purpose, value, worth and transferable skills (see schedules t, s 1, s 2, p and tr). Other main themes within the data include initiating tasks, assuming responsibility, independence and motivation; valuing coursework, assessment and achievement; creativity-as-problem-solving and creativity-as-individual-expression; subject domains and opportunities for creativity, critical thinking and/or independent learning; narrow and broad critical thinking; hybrid learning experiences, autonomy and assessment; locus of control, ability, ceilings and meeting potential; inconsistencies, assessment criteria and shared understandings.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to sociology {{and social policy}} discussions on water reform in New South Wales, Australia. While the study draws on political economy theory in examining water as &# 145;property&# 146; under economic rationalism policies, it makes an ethnographic contribution to rural sociology as it traces institutional reform in water management {{in the late twentieth}} century. The research is influenced by the theoretical concepts of Emile Durkheim on property relations, Pierre Bourdieu&# 146;s concepts of field, game, habitus and illusio and Niklas Luhmann&# 146;s concept &# 145;trust&# 146;. These sociological perspectives are integral to my research. The empirical research centred on field observation and qualitative interviews with farm managers and senior officers as the State clawed back over allocated water for environmental restoration. The aims of this study were: (a) to observe the implications of restrictions on water use for farmers under the Water Management Act 2000 (New South Wales). (b) to enquire into the strategies used by dryland and irrigation farm managers to cope with cutbacks in water allocations. And (c) to observe if the trust by farmers in government policy is eroding. I found that if the farmers cannot obtain water to develop their land and water further, to continue traditions of intergenerational change, then income is lost throughout the rural communities. Water reform principles &# 145;integrated water resource management&# 146; and &# 145;sustainable water resource management&# 146; give farmers a low priority for water access as trust in policy decisions is eroding. The small and medium broadacre farm managers <b>interiewed</b> retain their trust in their own abilities, resilience and survival strategies, such as earning off farm income. The larger agribusiness managers make decisions to accord with corporate objectives. If they cannot access adequate water resources their farms {{are more likely to be}} sold than are smaller or medium size broadacre farms.
