40|$|Was {{isolated}} and characterized a <b>flocculant</b> <b>yeast</b> strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae (LEG- 06), to ferment banana juice, extracted under basic conditions. Yield ethanol was compared with commercial yeasts and were also evaluated {{the effects of}} pH and neutralizing agent. Additionally, the effect on efficiency of 10 successive fermentations using the same yeast. Finally, the fermentation was scaled in a 40 L tubular reactor with mechanical agitation and the kinetic parameters were determined from yeast. Ideal conditions were: pH 5, 5 using citric acid as a neutralizer, 23, 8 g/L yeast 14, 5 °Brix. The efficiency was between 82 - 84...|$|E
40|$|Sugar cane juice, of feed fermentables {{concentration}} of 100 - 180 g/l, was simply and rapidly fermented to ethanol in a tower fermenter, using a naturally <b>flocculant</b> <b>yeast.</b> Stable cell densities of 65 - 80 g dry wt/l were obtained. Conversion and ethanol productivity data are given {{as a function}} of throughput and initial feed concentration. The limitation to fermenter performance with this yeast was imposed by carryover of non-fermented sugars, principally fructose, rather than washout of the yeast flocs under high hydraulic loadings (residence times of less than 1. 5 hours). Further improvement of the fermenter performance may be achieved by strain selection...|$|E
40|$|Six {{different}} yeasts {{were isolated}} from saliva on starch agar on pH 4 at 25 °C. These were white with mycelium production after 17 days incubation. 3 strains of those isolated had amylase activities. The maximum -amylase produced with 10 l filter steriled saliva, added to starch media. The maximum -amylase production on this media was 28 Um l 1 h 1. The enzyme from strain B was stable at 25 °C, however, the enzyme activities in strain E were stable at 25 ° to 60 °C. The yeast strain E had maximum -amylase {{activities in the}} presence of saliva (10 ml) and was the best <b>flocculants</b> <b>yeast</b> which decreased the optical density to 0. 02 in one hour. This strain used all 1 % starch in 17 days...|$|R
