5|$|Following {{a request}} from the Chief of Combined Operations Admiral Louis Mountbatten for probes of German coastal defences, No. 62 Commando, {{also known as the}} Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF), mounted a number of {{operations}} in 1942. The first three missions were complete successes: Operation Barricade (14/15 August 1942), Operation <b>Dryad,</b> (2/3 September 1942), and Operation Pound (7/8 September 1942). Aquatint was planned for a night in mid September 1942 as a reconnaissance mission near Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes, a small coastal town near Port en Bessin in Normandy. The mission was to collect information about the surrounding area, and take a German guard prisoner. Aerial reconnaissance had identified a small group of houses on the seafront thought to be occupied by Germans.|$|E
5|$|There {{were seven}} Commando {{missions}} {{carried out on}} the Channel Islands. Operation Ambassador {{was the first and}} largest of these, employing 140 men from No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company in a night raid on 14 July 1940. Later raids were much smaller; only 12 men of No. 62 Commando took part in Operation <b>Dryad</b> in September 1942, when they captured seven prisoners and located several German codebooks. Operation Branford, a reconnaissance mission that aimed to identify a suitable gun position to support future raids on Alderney, followed only days later. In October of that year 12 men from No.s 12 and 62 Commandos took part in Operation Basalt, a raid on Sark that saw four Germans killed and one taken prisoner.|$|E

25|$|On 19 April 1800, Revolutionnaire and <b>Dryad</b> {{arrived in}} Milford Haven in a distressed state. <b>Dryad</b> {{had been on}} a cruise out of Cork and was on her way home when on 2 April, with her rigging much damaged by hurricanes, when she had {{encountered}} Revolutionnaire, which had lost her rudder. <b>Dryad</b> escorted Revolutionnaire to Cork, but when they were no more than an hour out of the port, the winds blew them towards Plymouth. On 16 April they were close to the rocks at Waterford when <b>Dryad</b> succeeded in getting a cable on to Revolutionnaire. Unfortunately, the cable broke and <b>Dryad</b> pulled away, expecting Revolutionnaire to wreck on the rocks. However, providentially, the wind shifted and pushed her away from shore. On 19 April both vessels succeeded in safely reaching Milford Haven.|$|E

25|$|<b>Dryad</b> had the honour of {{returning}} Admiral Lord Gardner to his command at Cork in 1804. She {{remained on the}} Irish Station, {{but at the end}} of the year Captain Giffard left the ship due to ill health. His replacement, in January 1805, was Captain (later Admiral Sir) Adam Drummond. On 2 November off Ferrol <b>Dryad,</b> in company with , encountered four French ships-of-the-line under Rear-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley that had escaped from the Battle of Trafalgar. <b>Dryad</b> and Boadicea tried to entice the French into the path of a Royal Navy squadron. Although <b>Dryad</b> and Boadicea lost the French ships of the line, a squadron under the command of Sir Richard Strachan had seen the rocket signals the frigates had launched. In the subsequent Battle of Cape Ortegal, the British captured Formidable, Scipion, Duguay-Trouin and Mont Blanc. Unfortunately, having lost the French squadron, neither Boadicea nor <b>Dryad</b> shared in the benefits that their actions had made possible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dryad</b> sailed for Cork, escorting a convoy.

Also, at some point <b>Dryad</b> recaptured the British ship Albion. Albion had been sailing from Jamaica with a cargo of rum and sugar when the French privateer Brieve captured her.|$|E

25|$|HMS <b>Dryad</b> was a fifth-rate sailing frigate of the Royal Navy {{that served}} for 64 years, at first during the Napoleonic Wars {{and then in}} the {{suppression}} of slavery.

25|$|<b>Dryad</b> was {{decommissioned}} for {{the last}} time at Sheerness in November 1884. She was sold in September 1885 and broken up in April 1886.|$|E

Prize money was paid in 1812. The expedition ended in failure, mostly due to malaria decimating the expeditionary force, which withdrew by September.|$|E
