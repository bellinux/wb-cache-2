500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back." [...] An article in the Belgium paper De Standaard agreed: [...] "It's about the brutality of man, who shamelessly takes what isn't his." ...|$|E

But we must not, on the other hand, say that because the Israelis win this war, as they won the '67 War, that we <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> with status quo. It can't be done." [...] Kissinger replied [...] "I couldn't agree more" ...|$|E

2500|$|Jamie Todd Rubin, {{reviewing}} {{the issue of}} Astounding in which the story originally appeared, writes [...] "f all the stories in the issue, de Camp’s is the best written. There is no feeling of pulp writing or story-telling. It is a smooth tale that comes alive in your imagination so that {{you feel like you}} are right there with the characters on their journey. Abou the only weakness in the story was the ending, which returns to the father and his adopted son. I didn’t think the ending lived up to the full potential of the story, and almost would have liked to seen the beginning and ending left off, and <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the wonderful journey through the African wilderness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harris' {{criticism}} of the gameplay include the [...] "frustrating control, chuggy animation, and levels that <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> far too long." [...] He felt the levels needed more variety, stating that [...] "the missions are dreadfully too long and feature very little change in gameplay regardless of the settings and craft to control." [...] Eduardo Zacarias of GameZone also said the game had poor controls and, like Harris, criticized [...] "the fact that the levels seem to drag on forever". He felt there were [...] "a few things that do keep the game from being a simple shooter in outer space, {{such as the ability}} to zoom through the forests of Endor on a speeder bike," [...] but added that [...] "these are just minor distractions that just hide the fact that this game is just way too repetitive." [...] Zacarias enjoyed the amount of detail in background of locations such as the forests of Endor, but criticized the vehicle graphics for looking like bad imitations. Nintendo Power gave Flight of the Falcon a score of 2.3 out of 5, echoing Harris and Zacarias's {{criticism of}} the length of the levels. The magazine stated, however, that the game has [...] "an unmistakable Star Wars flair." ...|$|E
2500|$|British rock critic Nick Kent wrote that, {{sometime}} in the mid-1960s: [...] "Wilson began getting wrapped up in big complicated ideas like 'Art' and 'Civilization'. People would tell him the most commonplace facts about such-and-such a composer or painter and Brian would just flip right out ... A visitor would read a fragment from a volume of Omar Khayyam and Brian Wilson would leap up, his head just awash with all this magical dumb inspiration, screaming 'Wow' and 'Too much' {{over and over again}} because he sensed right there and then that this guy had access to all the answers to the problems besetting our troubled universe. According to unnamed participants of the Smile sessions, [...] "If you came up to the house and introduced something new to Brian's thought processes–astrology, a different way to think about the relationship of Russia to China, anything at all–if {{all of a sudden he}} was into that, it would find its way into the music. You could hear a bit and say, 'I know where that feeling came from.'" [...] Tony Asher remembers that Wilson [...] "exhibit this awful taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book he'd just read. Or else he'd <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> and on about girls." ...|$|E

2500|$|Asher {{explains}} that he and Wilson had many lengthy, intimate discussions centered around their [...] "experiences and feelings about women and the various stages of relationships and so forth". He maintains that his contribution to the music itself was minimal, serving mainly {{as a source of}} second opinion for Wilson as he worked out possible melodies and chord progressions, although the two did trade ideas as the songs evolved. On his role as co-lyricist, Asher clarified, [...] "The general tenor of the lyrics was always his... and the actual choice of words was usually mine. I was really just his interpreter." [...] While speaking about [...] "God Only Knows", Wilson reflected: [...] "I think Tony had a musical influence on me somehow. After about ten years, I started thinking about it deeper... because I had never written that kind of song. And I remember him talking about 'Stella by Starlight' and he had a certain love for classic songs." [...] A typical writing session would either start with Wilson playing melody or chord patterns that he'd been working on, by discussing a recent record that Wilson liked the feel of, or by discussing a subject that Wilson had always wanted to write a song about. Asher called his interactions with Wilson and the Beach Boys an [...] "embarrassing" [...] experience, and that Wilson [...] "exhibit this awful taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book [...] he'd just read.

2500|$|In February 2015, Nina made {{a special}} {{appearance}} on the 20th-year anniversary of variety show ASAP where her performance of [...] "Vision of Love" [...] with fellow singers Juris and Kyla became a trending topic in social media. After {{taking a break from}} showbiz, Nina announced that she gave birth to a baby girl, Ysabella Louise, on December 24, 2015 after an eight-year relationship with her husband Coy Enriquez. She labored for 13 hours and decided to give a painful birth, without anaesthesia, to feel the sacrifices of being a mother. In an interview with Philippine Entertainment Portal, she expressed choosing to keep her personal life private, stating [...] "I chose to be quiet and <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> with my life normally. I have people in my life who are also into their privacy. [...] which is totally different to theirs." [...] She added that she is not hooked in social media and she often just post pictures to promote her shows. On June 14, 2016, she was featured on the debut single of R duo Joshua Desiderio and Lloyd Zaragoza (JO.LLO), entitled [...] "Ikaw ang Bida." [...] On June 19, 2017, Nina made an appearance on Wish 107.5 radio station's [...] "Charlie Puth Special" [...] where she performed [...] "Attention" [...] and her hit single [...] "Jealous" [...] during the Wish Bus roadshow.
