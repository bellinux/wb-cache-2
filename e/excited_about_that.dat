25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> because the longer you stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but it seemed like a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E
500|$|Wolfgang's {{original}} intention {{with the}} album {{was to create a}} collection of previously released b-sides along with three reworked demos, with Eddie saying: [...] "It would [...] a record of our more hardcore songs and none of the pop stuff. That was the initial plan, but the deeper we dug, the more we found. At the same time I was writing new songs. Dave got very <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> We all did. We ended up recording demos for 35 songs." [...] After deliberating over whether to self-produce the album or choose a producer from a list that included Rick Rubin and Pat Leonard, Roth suggested John Shanks. Shanks liked the first three songs, and agreed to produce the album, working alongside Wolfgang to pick the demos that would be developed into the album's tracks. While all of Van Halen's albums since 1984 had been produced inside 5150, Roth persuaded the band to work at Henson Recording Studios—where he had been recording for over a decade.|$|E
500|$|Evanescence {{began their}} tour {{to promote the}} album with a concert at War Memorial Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, on August 17, 2011. This was {{followed}} by performances at Rock on the Range in Winnipeg on August 20, Rock in Rio on October 2 and at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in Puerto Rico on October 6. The band began the first US leg of their tour on October 10 in Oakland, California, and finished it in New York City. Evanescence then played several concerts in the United Kingdom, beginning at London's Hammersmith Apollo on November 4 and finishing the leg on November 13 at the O2 Academy Birmingham. Supported by The Pretty Reckless, Fair to Midland and Rival Sons, the tour's set list included songs from Evanescence's three albums. Lee said, [...] "We're definitely focusing mainly on the new material. We're really <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> music the most – obviously it's the newest – but of course we'll be playing some from both of our other albums too. I guess I'd say in general, our show's on the heavy-energy side, so we'll be running around singing a lot of fast songs." ...|$|E
5000|$|One of Gilbert's {{earliest}} works, Smallbone Deceased, {{was included}} in crime-writer H.R.F. Keating's list, Crime & Mystery: The 100 Best Books. [...] In Gilbert's New York Times obituary, his American publisher, Kent Carroll of Carroll & Graf, {{was quoted as saying}} about him, [...] "He was always so utterly urbane and civilized. He wrote about a sordid world {{from the perspective of a}} gentleman. There was something comforting as well as <b>exciting</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R

500|$|American {{recording}} artist Kanye West {{also contributed to}} three tracks on the album; Madonna called him [...] "the black Madonna" [...] and said, [...] "We're comrades in the envelope-pushing genre". Madonna said, [...] "It's {{a little bit of}} a bullfight, but we take turns. He knows that he's walking into a room with a person with a strong point of view, and I do, too. I listen to what he has to say, take it in, and he listens to what I say and takes it in. We didn't agree on everything, but he has good ideas." [...] She told Rolling Stone that of the songs she played him, West connected the most with [...] "Illuminati" [...] and that, [...] "e loved the melody, and he was actually jumping up and down on the soundboard. He literally stood on top of the mixing board—we were worried he was going to hit his head on the ceiling, but he didn't. He ended up being very <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> track, and then he added his spin to it, musically, and I love it. To me, he elevated the lyrics with the music. It's like a siren, alerting people." [...] In December 2014, thirteen demos of tracks for the album, including [...] "Illuminati", were leaked to the Internet. To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks, including the final version of [...] "Illuminati" [...] with the addition of West's writing and production, with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an [...] "early Christmas gift".|$|E
500|$|The {{record is}} highly {{regarded}} {{among the members}} of U2. Mullen said, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} record. I was very proud of it. Its success was by no means preordained. It was a real break from what we had done before and we didn't know if our fans would like it or not." [...] Bono called the album a [...] "pivot point" [...] in the band's career, saying, [...] "Making Achtung Baby is the reason we're still here now." [...] Clayton concurred, saying, [...] "If we hadn't done something we were <b>excited</b> <b>about,</b> <b>that</b> made us apprehensive and challenged everything we stood for, then there would really have been no reason to carry on... If it hadn't been a great record by our standards, the existence of the band would have been threatened." [...] The group's reinvention occurred at the peak of the alternative rock movement, when the genre was achieving widespread mainstream popularity. Bill Flanagan pointed out that many of U2's 1980s contemporaries struggled commercially with albums released after the turn of the decade. He argued that U2, however, were able to take advantage of the alternative rock movement and ensure a successful future by [...] "set themselves up as the first of the new groups rather than the last of the old". Toby Creswell echoed these sentiments in his 2006 music reference book 1001 Songs, writing that the album helped U2 avoid [...] "becoming parodies of themselves and being swept aside by the grunge and techno revolutions". AllMusic called the album [...] "a pivotal moment for dance-rock, happening late in the game but showing that even the biggest young band in the world had an eye on the dancefloor". A 2010 retrospective by Spin said that [...] "U2 became the emblematic band of the alternative-rock era with Achtung Baby." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a March 2010 MTV {{interview}} {{about the new}} album, Way explained, [...] "There's no title yet...I'm actually kind of <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> It's kind of 'anything goes' at this point, but I'm so happy with the songs." [...] Though the band since decided on the title of their fourth album, it continued to go unannounced, with various rumors circulating and the band stating on their website {{that it will be}} revealed [...] "all in due time" [...] and in Way's words, [...] "a special way this time. Maybe some sort of event, something fun, something soon." ...|$|E

Via Hiphop Wired, Joe revealed that he and Remy Ma are releasing a joint album. He said [...] "Me and Remy just wrapped up a new album. Just me and Remy. I’m super <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> The album is ridiculous. So we’ve been working musically like crazy.” He reported the first single would be “All the Way Up” and features French Montana and Infared, which later peaked at #27 on the Hot 100, becoming his first top 40 hit in nearly a decade. They have shot the video and it was released on February 3, 2016. Joe could not explain what the album would be called saying, [...] "I have the title, but we’re {{trying to see if}} we can legally use the title." [...] The album would be titled Plata O Plomo and {{was released in}} February 2017.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 however, {{during an}} {{interview}} with MTV about Destiny's Child's #1's album and last single [...] "Stand Up For Love", Beyoncé Knowles said Williams was [...] "working on her third solo album" [...] which [...] "may veer from gospel" [...] to a more [...] "mainstream R" [...] sound. Also referenced in the article is Williams' cover of the Al Green classic, [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] that was not only featured in a Gap commercial {{but also on the}} Roll Bounce soundtrack. In 2006, Williams confirmed her change of musical direction and sound explaining, [...] "I know my first two albums were gospel, but I'm going to do some soul music because I love R music, so I'm <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> opportunity" [...] at Clive Davis's annual pre-Grammy party.

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay" [...] was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. On February 10, 2013, whilst walking the red carpet of the 55th Grammy Awards, Rihanna held an interview with Ryan Seacrest who officially revealed that the music video would premiere on E! News the following day. Rihanna described the production saying, [...] "The video was really, really simple. I pretty much stayed put in a bathtub, and we shot it really tight, really close. There's Mikky Ekko in the video as well. This {{is the first time}} I've ever collaborated with him, so I'm <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> because he's actually the one who wrote the song and I kinda just {{fell in love with it}} so much and in love with the tone of his voice and we wanna keep him a part of it, so you'll see him in the video." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's a very emotional song and it's personal, so you just think about, it's almost like telling a story, and when you tell a story, even to yourself — if you're saying it out loud and expressing how you feel — it needs to be powerful because it needs to be authentic." [...] On February 11, Rihanna leaked an [...] "uncut" [...] version of the video on Twitter prior to the official premiere, featuring the singer performing to the track in one singular take, without Mikky Ekko. The official version premiered on E! News later that day. It was then uploaded to Rihanna's official VEVO account at 8AM ET the following day. Shortly after the video was uploaded, it was flagged by YouTube for its sexual content. The flag has since been removed.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2015, Jonathan Levine, Ted Melfi, Jason Moore, {{the writing}} team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, and Jared Hess were being {{considered}} {{to direct the}} film. Butterfield, Holland, Judah Lewis, Matthew Lintz, Charlie Plummer, and Charlie Rowe screen tested for the lead role against Robert Downey Jr., who portrays Tony Stark / Iron Man in the MCU, for [...] "chemistry". The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal, and the Russo brothers, the directors of Captain America: Civil War. By early June 2015, Levine and Melfi had become the favorites to direct the film, with Daley and Goldstein, and Jon Watts also in consideration, while Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe, with both screen testing with Downey again. Holland also tested with Chris Evans, who portrays Steve Rogers / Captain America in the MCU, and emerged as the favorite. On June 23, Marvel and Sony officially announced that Holland would star as Spider-Man, and that Watts would direct the film. The Russos [...] "were pretty vocal about who [...] wanted for the part", pushing to cast an actor close {{to the age of}} Peter Parker in order to differentiate from the previous portrayals. They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background. Watts was able to read the Civil War script, talk with the Russos, and was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes in that film. He was able to [...] "see what they were doing with it" [...] and provide [...] "ideas about this and that", including what Parker's bedroom and wardrobe looked like [...] "so that my movie transitions seamlessly with theirs." [...] On joining the MCU and directing the film, Watts said, [...] "I was really <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> because the other movies have shown what I described as the Penthouse level of the Marvel world, what it’s like to be Thor, Iron Man, you know, a billionaire playboy and all of that stuff. But what’s great about Spider-Man is that he’s a regular kid and so by showing his story you also get to show what the ground level is like in a world where the Avengers exist".|$|E

60|$|It is a perplexing business. First, {{she fell}} {{down out of}} the tree--she and the blanket; and the bear caught her and fondled her--her and the blanket; then she fell up into the tree again--leaving the blanket; {{meantime}} the lover goes war-whooping home and comes back 'heeled,' climbs the tree, jumps down on the bear, the girl jumps down after him--apparently, for she was up the tree--resumes her place in the bear's arms along with the blanket, the lover rams his knife into the bear, and saves--whom, the blanket? No--nothing of the sort. You get yourself all worked up and <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> blanket, {{and then all of a}} sudden, just when a happy climax seems imminent you are let down flat--nothing saved but the girl. Whereas, one is not interested in the girl; she is not the prominent feature of the legend. Nevertheless, there you are left, and there you must remain; for if you live a thousand years you will never know who got the blanket. A dead man could get up a better legend than this one. I don't mean a fresh dead man either; I mean a man that's been dead weeks and weeks.|$|E
