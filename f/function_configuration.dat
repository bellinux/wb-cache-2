This article explores the <b>function,</b> <b>configuration</b> and generation of trust in AFNs. The structure is twofold. First we discuss the theoretical underpinnings of trust, in both recent AFN literature and in sociology, and develop a conceptual framework for analyzing trust in AFN. Second, we explore the <b>function,</b> <b>configuration</b> and generation of trust in the Food Communities of Copenhagen and Aarhus (in Danish: “Fødevarefællesskaberne”). The Food Communities are a network of urban consumers sourcing organic products from regional producers. Empirically, the article demonstrates that trust functions as a mechanism that creates coherency and which facilitates cooperation in the food network. Furthermore, the Food Communities are characterized by high levels of systemic and personal trust. Several mechanisms, like managing expectations, establishing trustworthiness, and developing a common normative basis, are employed and contribute to the generation and maintenance of trust...|$|E

40|$|SMOS & Aquarius Science Workshop, 15 - 17 April 2013, Brest, FranceIn this study, a {{simplified}} parallel {{version of the}} operational Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Level 2 data processor (L 2 OS) is {{used to assess the}} optimal configuration of both the SMOS Bayesian-based cost function and the corresponding Levenberg-Marquardt based multi-parametric minimization scheme for sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface wind speed (U 10) retrievals. Within such a framework, realistically simulated brightness temperature measurements (TBs) and a post-launch derived semi-empirical forward model (FM) are used. As already anticipated in pre-launch studies, the results carried out in this work demonstrate that the SMOS cost function needs to be constrained by a priori information on the sea-surface related geophysical parameters, due to the low TB sensitivity with respect to both SSS and U 10 changes. Furthermore, the present study, in which a variety of marine scenarios are simulated, confirms that the operationally used SMOS L 2 OS cost <b>function</b> <b>configuration</b> is optimal for SSS retrieval purposes. As a novelty, this study shows that the optimal SMOS cost <b>function</b> <b>configuration</b> for U 10 retrievals is different from the one used for SSS retrieval purposes. This is mainly due to the TB sensitivity to SSS changes being different to the TB sensitivity to U 10 changes.

By discussing the articulation of these four positions, and their interrelation, we conclude that instrumentalism about Ψ is by itself not sufficient to choose {{one over the other}} interpretations of quantum mechanics, thereby confirming in a different way the indetermination of the metaphysical interpretations of quantum mechanics.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} creating neural field models from electrophysiological data. The Wilson and Cowan or Amari style neural field equations are used to form a parametric model, where the parameters are estimated from data. To illustrate the estimation framework, data is generated using the neural field equations incorporating modeled sensors enabling a comparison between the estimated and true parameters. To facilitate state and parameter estimation, we introduce a method to reduce the continuum neural field model using a basis function decomposition to form a finite-dimensional state-space model. Spatial frequency analysis methods are introduced that systematically specify the basis <b>function</b> <b>configuration</b> required to capture the dominant characteristics of the neural field. The estimation procedure consists of a two-stage iterative algorithm incorporating the unscented Rauch–Tung–Striebel smoother for state estimation and a least squares algorithm for parameter estimation.

We study {{two classes of}} its exact solutions for doubly periodic domains (or doubly periodic vortex arrays in the plane). Both types contain vortex dipoles of different configurations, an elongated "cat-eye" pattern, and a "diagonal" (symmetric) configuration. We derive two new solutions, one for each class. The first one is a generalization of the Mallier-Maslowe vortices, while the second one consists of two corotating vortices in a square cell. Next, we examine the dynamic stability of such vortex dipoles to initial perturbations, by numerical simulations of the 2 D Euler flows on periodic domains. One typical member from each class is chosen for analysis. The diagonally symmetric equilibrium maintains stability for all (even strong) perturbations, whereas the cat-eye pattern relaxes to a more stable dipole of the diagonal type. © 2004 American Institute of Physics. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{systematic}} design is proposed to determine fuzzy system structure and learning its parameters, from {{a set of}} given training examples. In particular, two fundamental problems concerning fuzzy system modeling are addressed: 1) fuzzy rule parameter optimization and 2) the identification of system structure (i. e., the number of membership functions and fuzzy rules). A four-step approach to build a fuzzy system automatically is presented: Step 1 directly obtains the optimum fuzzy rules for a given membership <b>function</b> <b>configuration.</b> Step 2 optimizes the allocation of the membership functions and {{the conclusion of the}} rules, in order to achieve a better approximation. Step 3 determines a new and more suitable topology with the information derived from the approximation error distribution; it decides which variables should increase the number of membership functions. Finally, Step 4 determines which structure should be selected to approximate the function, from the possible configurations provided by the algorithm in the three previous steps. The results of applying this method to the problem of function approximation are presented and then compared with other methodologies proposed in the bibliography.
