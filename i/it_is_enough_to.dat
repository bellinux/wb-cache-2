For a graph G of treewidth at most k and a graph H, the homomorphism problem can be solved in time |V(H)|O(k) with a standard dynamic programming approach.

5|$|GE has {{installed}} a prototype wind turbine with onboard battery {{similar to that}} of an electric car, equivalent of 1 minute of production. Despite the small capacity, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> guarantee that power output complies with forecast for 15 minutes, as the battery is used to eliminate the difference rather than provide full output. In certain cases the increased predictability can be used to take wind power penetration from 20 to 30 or 40 per cent. The battery cost can be retrieved by selling burst power on demand and reducing backup needs from gas plants.|$|E
5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum. This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined. The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride, then using a cation-exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid, acting as an eluant. However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion-exchange chromatography, the eluant being 6Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E

25|$|In {{fact the}} Jordan algebra and module {{properties}} follow by replacing a and b in the polarized Jordan identity by e and a. If ea = 0, this gives L(e)L(a) = 2L(e)L(a)L(e). Taking adjoints {{it follows that}} L(a) commutes with L(e). Similarly if (1 − e)a = 0, L(a) commutes with I − L(e) and hence L(e). This implies the Jordan algebra and module properties. To check that a product of elements in the module lies in the algebra, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> check this for squares: but if L(e)a = ½ a, then ea = ½ a, so L(a)2 + L(a2)L(e) = 2L(a)L(e)L(a) + L(a2e). Taking adjoints it follows that L(a2) commutes with L(e), which implies the property for squares.|$|E

25|$|Gluon fusion. If the {{collided}} {{particles are}} hadrons {{such as the}} proton or antiproton—as {{is the case in}} the LHC and Tevatron—then it is most likely that two of the gluons binding the hadron together collide. The easiest way to produce a Higgs particle is if the two gluons combine to form a loop of virtual quarks. Since the coupling of particles to the Higgs boson is proportional to their mass, this process is more likely for heavy particles. In practice <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> consider the contributions of virtual top and bottom quarks (the heaviest quarks). This process is the dominant contribution at the LHC and Tevatron being about ten times more likely {{than any of the other}} processes.|$|E
25|$|When Dean becomes {{increasingly}} controlling over Roxy, Ronnie asks Linda's {{help to get}} rid of him. Linda turns her away, but her fiancé, Dean's brother Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), later visits Ronnie and agrees to help her. However, he cannot go through with the plan at the last minute. Dean and Roxy decide to move away, upsetting Ronnie, so she gets Billy to rob his salon. However, Dean realises she was behind it, so proposes to Roxy in front of Ronnie. She tries to pay him off to leave, but he realises she is recording their conversation, so plays it to Roxy at their engagement party. They argue, and Ronnie smashes up the Albert bar, before she tells her relative Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) she is going to kill Dean. He warns Mick, and eventually Dean's parents Buster Briggs (Karl Howman) and Shirley, who arrive after Ronnie has given him a drink full of crushed up drugs. She reveals it was only a plan to scare him, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make Roxy confess to Dean that Ronnie is a murderer, so he convinces Roxy to go to the police. Ronnie is seemingly arrested during a family dinner with the Mitchells. However, Ronnie realises they aren't police, and they drop her off in a wasteland, only for her to be picked up by Vincent. He tells her the police are going to charge her for Carl's murder, and she needs {{to get out of the}} country. She decides to confess to the police, but Vincent admits that he is a police informant, and Ronnie agrees to leave. However, Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) gives her a file he found in Vincent's safe, revealing he is working to take down the Mitchells. Vincent tries to blackmail her into framing Phil for drug trafficking, using a confession of her admitting to killing Carl. Phil, who has returned to drinking, disowns Ronnie, but she still protects him when Vincent plants a gun on him and calls the police. After, Ronnie destroys the copies of her confession and keeps the gun, threatening to kill Vincent if he threatens her again.|$|E

In the ensuing Second Italian War of Independence the Austrians abandoned the region and began to leave Lombardy, although they remained {{in control of the}} Venice region {{under the terms of the}} armistice signed at Villafranca.

500|$|Only {{vertebrate}} {{animals have}} ears, though many invertebrates detect sound using {{other kinds of}} sense organs. In insects, tympanal organs are used to hear distant sounds. They are located either on the head or elsewhere, depending on the insect family. The tympanal organs of some insects are extremely sensitive, offering acute hearing beyond that of most other animals. The female cricket fly Ormia ochracea has tympanal organs {{on each side of}} her abdomen. They are connected by a thin bridge of exoskeleton and they function like a tiny pair of eardrums, but, because they are linked, they provide acute directional information. The fly uses her [...] "ears" [...] to detect the call of her host, a male cricket. Depending on where the song of the cricket is coming from, the fly's hearing organs will reverberate at slightly different frequencies. This difference may be as little as 50billionths of a second, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> allow the fly to home in directly on a singing male cricket and parasitise it.|$|E

500|$|The {{triumph of}} the Belyayev circle {{could be seen as}} the worst of both worlds from The Five and Tchaikovsky for two reasons. First, from Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, the Belyayevets {{realized}} the importance of a solid academic grounding, but they took the importance of their conservatory training to extremes, and devolved into academicism and [...] They failed to take into account that Tchaikovsky transcended what authority David Brown calls [...] "the heavy conditioning of his conservatory training" [...] through his [...] "innate Russianness and his love of his own country's folk music", and that Rimsky-Korsakov similarly transcended a period of extremely pedantic music writing to arrive at a more balanced style. Second, the Belyayevets got the idea from The Five of a school to which all members would adhere, but they took adherence to their school to the point of mediocrity, with [...] "a safe conformism" [...] becoming [...] "increasingly the rule". This was the point that composer César Cui, a former member of The Five, made in his article [...] "Fathers and Sons" [...] in 1888, when he wrote, [...] "Despite the frequent contact of all the fathers with one another, each of them preserved intact his individuality. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> glance at a single page of music by one of the fathers to say with certainty that it is the work of Borodin, Balakirev, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, or Korsakov.

500|$|Irene {{has never}} been the most admired of Johnson's works. [...] Even James Boswell found it wanting:Analysed into parts, it will furnish a rich store of noble sentiments, fine imagery, and {{beautiful}} language; but it is deficient in pathos, in that delicate power of touching the human feelings, which is the principle end of the drama. [...] Indeed Garrick has complained to me, that Johnson not only had not the faculty of producing the impressions of tragedy, but that he had not the sensibility to perceive them. Johnson's friend Bennet Langton recorded the author's own later disenchantment with the piece:At another time, when one was reading his tragedy Irene to a company at a house in the country, he [...] left the room; and somebody having asked him the reason of this, he replied, [...] "Sir, I thought it had been better."' The early 20th century consensus of opinion was summed up by George Sampson in 1941: [...] "Of his early tragedy Irene [...] <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> say that its moral dialogues, its correctness of plan and its smoothness of verse do not suffice to give it any rank as drama." [...] T. S. Eliot suggested an explanation for the play's unpopularity and neglect:His verse has none of the dramatic qualities; it is correct, but correctness in such isolation becomes itself a fault. [...] The play would be more readable to-day, if he had written it in rhyme; the whole would be more easily declaimed, and the good things more easily remembered; it would lose none of its excellence of structure, thought, vocabulary and figures of speech.
