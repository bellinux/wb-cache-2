40|$|Abstract. Ontologies play a {{key role}} in the Semantic Web the goal of which is to provide an {{environment}} able to advance quality of state-of-the-art web applications. Since we expect qualitative gains to come at the costs of increased <b>development</b> <b>effort,</b> we have decided to study the effect of an ontology on web application <b>development</b> <b>effort.</b> We have applied the WEBMO effort estimation model and discovered that for an average web application ontologies are expected to initially cause a manageable (around 10 %) increase of <b>development</b> <b>effort.</b> In the long run, however, ontologies have a potential to significantly improve efficiency of the overall development process resulting in around 50 % decrease of <b>development</b> <b>effort.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of software <b>development</b> <b>effort</b> needs to consider numerous factors in software {{projects such as}} project size, programming language, application type, team size, development platform and so on. Software methodology {{is one of the}} most effective parameters in this field. Basically, software methodologies are used in software projects in order to manage activities, artifacts, roles and disciplines. Researchers believe that methodologies can make project managers enable to deal with uncertain and complex nature of software projects. In spite of having noticeably advantages, using the methodologies may lead to inaccurate <b>development</b> <b>effort</b> estimation because there is no analytical evidence to clarify the real effect of using methodology on <b>development</b> <b>effort.</b> Underestimating the amount of effort required for utilizing methodology can have negative influences throughout the project. In this paper, an analysis was performed to draw the real situation of software projects in term of using methodologies. Furthermore, the effect of using methodologies on <b>development</b> <b>effort</b> was investigated to show how methodologies can affect the software <b>development</b> <b>effort.</b> A real and large dataset including 5052 software projects from various areas was used in this study. The results showed high interest to employ methodologies in recent software projects as well as high and significant impact of methodologies on <b>development</b> <b>effort...</b>|$|R

In this paper, a model for object-oriented software <b>development</b> <b>effort</b> estimation using one hidden layer feed forward neural network (OHFNN) has been developed. The model has been further optimized with the help of genetic algorithm by taking weight vector obtained from OHFNN as initial population for the genetic algorithm.

5|$|X-10 {{supplied}} the Los Alamos Laboratory {{with the first}} significant samples of plutonium. Studies of these by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos revealed that it contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240, which has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. This meant that it would be highly likely that a plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The Los Alamos Laboratory was thus forced to turn its <b>development</b> <b>efforts</b> to creating an implosion-type nuclear weapon—a far more difficult feat.|$|E
5|$|From 1919 to 1922, Kesselring {{served as}} a battery {{commander}} with the 24th Artillery Regiment. He joined the Reichswehr on 1 October 1922 and was posted to the Military Training Department at the Reichswehr Ministry in Berlin. He remained at this post until 1929, {{when he returned to}} Bavaria as commander of Wehrkreis VII in Munich. In his time with the Reichswehr Ministry, Kesselring was involved in the organisation of the army, trimming staff overheads to produce the best possible army with the limited resources available. He helped reorganise the Ordnance Department, laying the groundwork for the research and <b>development</b> <b>efforts</b> that would produce new weapons. He was involved in secret military manoeuvres held in the Soviet Union in 1924 and in the so-called Great Plan for a 102-division army, which was prepared in 1923 and 1924. After another brief stint at the Ministry of the Reichswehr, Kesselring was promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) in 1930 and spent two years in Dresden with the 4th Artillery Regiment.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, <b>development</b> <b>efforts</b> were {{directed}} to a gun-type fission weapon with plutonium called Thin Man. Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure, but could only be created in very small amounts. Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the Clinton X-10 reactor in April 1944 and within days Emilio Segrè discovered a problem: the reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium-240, resulting in up to five times the spontaneous fission rate of cyclotron plutonium. Seaborg had correctly predicted in March 1943 {{that some of the}} plutonium-239 would absorb a neutron and become plutonium-240.|$|E
5|$|Like the British Army, Australia did {{not have}} a {{parachute}} operations capability at the outbreak of the Second World War; however, the demonstration of the effectiveness of such forces by the Germans {{in the early stages of}} the conflict soon provided the impetus for their <b>development.</b> <b>Efforts</b> to raise an operational parachute capability in the Australian Army began in November 1942, with 40 volunteers being selected for initial training with the newly formed Paratroop Training Unit. The first descents were made at Tocumwal in New South Wales, with the initial parachute courses consisting of four jumps. By March 1943 enough personnel had been trained for the Army to consider forming a full parachute battalion. As a result, the 1st Parachute Battalion was raised at this time at RAAF Station Richmond near Sydney, New South Wales.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Union Carbide and Kellex {{had made}} {{researchers}} at the Bakelite Corporation, a subsidiary of Union Carbide, aware of Nix's unsuccessful efforts with powdered nickel barriers. To Frazier Groff and other researchers at Bakelite's laboratories in Bound Brook, New Jersey, it seemed that Nix was not {{taking advantage of the}} latest techniques, and they began their own <b>development</b> <b>efforts.</b> Both Bell and Bound Brook sent samples of their powdered nickel barriers to Taylor for evaluation, but he was unimpressed; neither had come up with a practical barrier. At Kellogg's laboratory in Jersey City, New Jersey, Clarence A. Johnson, who was aware of the steps taken by the SAM laboratories to improve the Norris-Adler barrier, realized that they could also be taken with the Bakelite barrier. The result was a barrier better than either, although still short of what was required. At a meeting at Columbia with the Army in attendance on 20 October 1943, Keith proposed switching the development effort to the Johnson barrier. Urey balked at this, fearing that this would destroy morale at the SAM Laboratories. The issue was put to Groves at a meeting on 3 November 1943, and he decided to pursue development of both the Johnson and Norris-Adler barriers.|$|E
