500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both of our other records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> can look at and go, 'OK, that's who that is.' But I feel like, by now, they know who we are, and I wanted something really different. I didn't feel like {{we had to put}} a photo on the cover, I wanted it to be more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E
500|$|La Dulzura {{represented}} a stylistic departure for the group, both musically and lyrically. The song [...] "Del Tope al Fondo" [...] {{is influenced by}} Argentine music, especially the genre of tango. Lyrically, the band discusses more romantic themes {{as opposed to the}} political emphasis of the group's previous records. [...] Guitarist Eliut Gonzalez remarked that the band aimed to shift discussion to [...] "the good things in the world", explaining [...] that [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> need help, and that behind every revolution or movement, there is love. We wanted to document that in our music, but without doing it in a cheesy or typical way." [...] The singles [...] "Baja la Tensión", [...] "La Complicidad", [...] "Para Estar" [...] and [...] "Ilegal" [...] all charted on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart. In 2011, the group collaborated with Dominican musician Vicente García on his single [...] "Mi Balcón".|$|E
500|$|As a child, Mars {{spent time}} impersonating Elvis Presley. This playact {{had a major}} impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love {{studying}} them because I'm a fan." [...] He also impersonated Michael Jackson and Little Richard, both of whom are major inspirations of his. Mars was raised on his father’s doo-wop collection — “simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point” and on Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis,and Frankie Lymon. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio constantly, also influenced him.|$|E

500|$|She {{also was}} seen by [...] others as a sex symbol. Aaliyah {{did not have a}} problem with being {{considered}} one. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> think I'm sexy and I am looked at as that, and it is cool with me," [...] she stated. [...] "It's wonderful to have sex appeal. If you embrace it, it can be a very beautiful thing. I am totally cool with that. Definitely. I see myself as sexy. If you are comfortable with it, it can be very classy and it can be very appealing." [...] The single [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] was argued to have transformed [...] "the once tomboy into a sexy grown woman". Aaliyah mentioned that her mother, during her childhood, would take pictures of her and notice a sex appeal. She reinforced her mother's belief by saying that she did feel [...] "sexy for sure" [...] and that she embraced it and was comfortable with this view of her.|$|E
500|$|Following the album's release, it was {{reported}} that A Little More Personal (Raw) was certified Gold in Taiwan, and that Lohan was going on tour with the album in the country. [...] "I just found this out today - my album went gold there. It was a great feeling because it was very unexpected", the singer revealed. [...] "I would love to (tour Taiwan). I haven't toured at all at this point, but I would really love to do that. It's a great feeling to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> in other places and other countries are aware of my music and what I do". The tour, however, didn't happen for unknown reasons. Lohan promoted the album in a few television appearances, including at MTV's Total Request Live {{on the day of the}} album's release, and at The Ellen DeGeneres Show on December 14, 2005. The singer performed [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart" [...] and her cover of [...] "Edge of Seventeen" [...] in the 2005 American Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|In May, {{columnist}} Joel Stein of Time magazine {{wrote about}} {{his young son}} Laszlo's frustration with the inescapable [...] "cultural assault" [...] of Frozen at preschool and all social and extracurricular activities, and how he had arranged for a Skype call with lead actress Bell after Laszlo began asking why the film was made. When Laszlo asked whether Bell knew when she made Frozen {{that it would take}} over kids' lives, she replied: [...] "I did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> would not let it go. No pun intended." [...] In a December 2014 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Lee acknowledged that she had transitioned from thanking people when they expressed their appreciation for Frozen to having to apologize when they said [...] "we're still listening to those songs" [...] (with their children). Lee also said that she used the film and its strong female characters to inspire her own daughter, who had experienced bullying at school, and admitted that she herself as a child was bullied as well; thus, they had managed to be true to themselves like Anna and Elsa.|$|E

Holy Soap recall Ruby's most memorable moment as being: [...] "Trying to cope with her Dad's illness, Ruby started talking to someone on Skype, {{only to find out}} it was Matthew playing a trick. She got revenge by convincing him to go skinny-dipping and nicking his clothes." [...] Carolyn Stewart writing for TV Week felt it was unrealistic for Ruby and Nicole to be best friends after she has [...] "actively pursued two of Nicole's ex-boyfriends." [...] She criticised Bianca's role in Ruby and Liam's storyline, quipping [...] "Bianca-The-Butt-In-Ski" [...] offered [...] "her two cents worth" [...] – subsequently calling her efforts unhelpful to Ruby. She also discussed Ruby's sudden descent into drink and wearing make up; [...] "Obviously heavy make-up is a clue that a character is about to go off the rails… and, boy did she!" [...] She said the moral of the storyline was to never {{fall in love with a}} teacher and that the situation had resulted in her as the [...] "drowned-rat Ruby with eye-liner pouring down her face". Stewart later said [...] "The way Ruby stares at Liam... oh, I'm just so embarrassed for the poor little petal! Hilarious!" [...] She also criticised Nicole's bad advice. She later praised the storyline stating it was getting [...] "juicy". Catrin Griffiths writing for the Daily Express said the serial came back in style after its summer break in the UK, owing to storylines such as Ruby's binge drinking.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} between the wars, feminists fought {{discrimination}} and establishment opposition. In Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, Woolf describes {{the extent of the}} backlash and her frustration at the waste of so much talent. By now, the word [...] "feminism" [...] was in use, but with a negative connotation from mass media, which discouraged women from self-identifying as such. In 1938, Woolf wrote of the term in Three Guineas, [...] "an old word ... that has much harm in its day and is now obsolete". When Rebecca West, another prominent writer, had been attacked as [...] "a feminist", Woolf defended her. West has been remembered for her comment [...] "I myself {{have never been able to}} find out precisely what feminism is: I only <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat, or a prostitute." [...] Woolf's writing also examined gender constructs and portrayed lesbian sexuality positively.|$|E
