It {{is one of the}} most important topics when it comes to specifying and controlling surface attributes such as roughness, waviness, and <b>form</b> <b>error.</b> These components of the surface deviations must be distinctly separable in measurement to achieve a clear understanding between the surface supplier and the surface recipient as to the expected characteristics of the surface in question. Typically, either digital or analog filters are used to separate <b>form</b> <b>error,</b> waviness, and roughness resulting from a measurement. Main multi-scale filtering methods are Gaussian filtering, Wavelet transform and more recentlty Discrete Modal Decomposition. There are three characteristics of these filters that should be known in order to understand the parameter values that an instrument may calculate. These are the spatial wavelength at which a filter separates roughness from waviness or waviness from <b>form</b> <b>error,</b> the sharpness of a filter or how cleanly the filter separates two components of the surface deviations and the distortion of a filter or how much the filter alters a spatial wavelength component in the separation process.|$|E

However, {{it has been}} shown that <b>form</b> <b>error,</b> or irregular deviations in geometry, aggravates thermal stresses, which in turn reduces product life. While <b>form</b> <b>error</b> can be measured on manufactured products using 3 D laser scanners, a simulation infrastructure is needed to analyze its effects on aerodynamic, structural and thermal performance. Moreover, in early product development phases, before manufacturing has begun, <b>form</b> <b>error</b> data is not available. This paper describes a method for including <b>form</b> <b>error</b> data in mainstream simulation activities. The suggested method works by creating parametric CAD-models to accommodate <b>form</b> <b>error.</b> There are two main benefits of this method. Firstly, it enables proactive robustness simulations where substantial design changes can be tested and evaluated.

A <b>form</b> <b>error</b> {{characterization}} of a reflective-type scale grating, {{which is used}} in three-degree-of-freedom (3 -DOF) encoders for position measurement of a planar motion stage, is presented. The scale grating has a micro-structured surface, the pitch of which is 1 µm in both X-and Y- direction. The periodic pattern on the scale grating generates diffracted beams when a laser beam incidents to the grating surface. The ± 1 st order diffracted beams from the grating contain information about the stage motions of not only X- or Y- directional in-plane displacement but also Z-directional out-of-plane displacement, and are therefore able to be utilized for multi-axis position detection. Accuracies of the position detection are mainly determined by a period deviation and a Z-directional out-of-flatness of the scale grating.

40|$|In {{precision}} machining field, grinding machining method {{is widely used}} as the high {{precision machining}} process for hard material machining to pursue high form and surface quality. With the raise of form measurement applications, the grinding machine has been increasingly applied for high form quality surface machining. However, due to the opaque property of coolant in the machining process, the conventional in-process optical measurement methods, which can provide feedback for surface quality control and {{have the advantage of}} high efficiency and high precision, cannot achieve the <b>form</b> <b>error</b> measurement in the grinding machine. Therefore, an air beam assisted <b>form</b> <b>error</b> in-process optical measurement method was proposed. A transparent window will be generated by the air beam so that the coolant influence will be reduced. In the previous studies of transparent window, the parameters influence on window size and stability was investigated. The results provide guideline for the work of this thesis. To find out the potential parameters which may have influence on <b>form</b> <b>error</b> and to obtain the relationship between the parameters and <b>form</b> <b>error,</b> a series of work of error assessment, equipment design and manufacturing, experiments and data analysis were done. A new in-process optical profiler, which can imitate the measurement process of the grinding machine, was designed and established for the <b>form</b> <b>error</b> measurement research and a new profile comparison method between 2 D and 3 D data was proposed. To ensure the accuracy and precision of the new equipment and processing method, the random and systematic errors of the in-process optical profiler and the Wyko optical profiler were assessed. Based on the results of error assessments plus several preliminary tests of the equipment, a specification of the in-process optical profiler was summarized. The random errors will be effectively reduced after 10 times’ repeated measurements. The systematic errors of the in-process optical profiler and the Wyko optical profiler are 0. 23 μm and 43 nm respectively. The repeatability error of the in-process optical profiler can reach 0. 31 %. In order to rank the input parameters, to find out the key input parameters and to investigate their basic effects on the <b>form</b> <b>error</b> measurement, a fractional factorial test was designed and conducted. In accordance with the results of the test, table velocity vt and coolant concentration cc were found as the most important input parameters. The basic relationships of other five parameters were also obtained. As the most important input parameters, table velocity vt was studies. Through the studies, the particular relationship between vt and <b>form</b> <b>error</b> was found. The lowest <b>form</b> <b>error</b> is 0. 59 μm when the vt= 0. 5 mm/s and the largest <b>form</b> <b>error</b> is 1. 54 μm when the vt= 30 mm/s.

This master thesis is a continuance of a previously conducted thesis made by Petter Stenmark. The purpose of the this project were to investigate the factors that affect the <b>form</b> <b>error</b> in finishing milling with insert mills and present effective ways of decreasing these errors. Seven different variables has been investigated in this thesis and these are: • Axial rake angle • Feed per tooth • Radius of cutting edge • Young’s modulus • Mass distribution • Workpiece material • Milling machines A increase in axial rake angle has, through simulations, calculations and experiments with solid mills, been verified to decrees the <b>form</b> <b>error</b> {{which was one of}} the conclusion Stenmark had made. No conclusions could, however, be made regarding the percentile reduction of the <b>form</b> <b>error</b> the axial rake angle had. The influence of the feed and the radius of the cutting edge showed to be somewhat linked to each other. An increase of cutting feed did not necessarily increase the normal force Fy that controls the magnitude of the deflection to the presumed levels. This had a lot to do with the relation between the edge radius and the chip thickness. If the edge radius were very large would the divergens between a feed 0. 1 and 0. 3 mm not effect the <b>form</b> <b>error</b> very much. The next two variables, which are Young’s modulus and mass distribution, are also linked to each other.

Suitable condition of Qw∈[0. 45 ml/s- 0. 75 ml/s], hm ∈[0. 3 mm- 0. 6 mm], vt ∈[60 mm/s- 150 mm/s], φw ∈[1. 0 mm- 1. 5 mm], and cc ∈[0. 05 - 0. 15] would give a transparent window of approximately 20 - 40 mm 2 in size, which is sufficient for the <b>form</b> <b>error</b> inprocess optical measurement...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess an {{experimental}} analysis of different tool-path strategies with respect to their influences on surface roughness and dimensional machining errors during free-form surface machining using experimental works. For this purpose, the machining of Al 7075 -T 651 material, which is used in the production of free-form surfaces for the die-sinking sector, in particular, was examined using a ball-end mill in a 3 -axis CNC machine. The effects of the tool diameters and of the rough and finished machining strategies on the presence and character of <b>form</b> <b>errors</b> and surface roughness were investigated and the results were optimized using a Grey Relational Analysis. The results obtained from these experiments clearly indicate the influence of tool-path strategies and tool diameters on <b>form</b> <b>errors,</b> as well as the importance of the appropriate strategies for reducing the surface roughness...|$|R
