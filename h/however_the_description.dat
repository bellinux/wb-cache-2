5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, her head is {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. <b>However,</b> <b>the</b> <b>description</b> of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
25|$|The {{parentage}} information, however, {{does not}} reveal how old the grape variety is, i.e., when the pollination of a Mondeuse blanche vine by Dureza took place, {{leading to the}} original Syrah seed plant. In the year AD 77, Pliny the Elder wrote in his Naturalis Historia about the wines of Vienne (which today would be called Côte-Rôtie), where the Allobroges made famous and prized wine from a dark-skinned grape variety that had not existed some 50 years earlier, in Virgil's age. Pliny called the vines of this wine Allobrogica, {{and it has been}} speculated that it could be today's Syrah. <b>However,</b> <b>the</b> <b>description</b> of the wine would also fit, for example, Dureza, and Pliny's observation that vines of Allobrogica were resistant to cold is not entirely consistent with Syrah.|$|E

500|$|Bowers credits Martin J. Faust {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} actors in for Thanhouser in 1910 and 1911, but Faust's role in productions often went uncredited. The role of a young daughter was Marie Eline, soon to be known and famous as the [...] "Thanhouser Kid". A possible film still exists for the work and the identity of the actors are complimentary in between two identical stills in the Jonathan Silent Film Collection. The description of T-151, identifies the man in the center as Martin Faust and notes the possibility that the still comes from this work. <b>However,</b> <b>the</b> <b>description</b> for T-176 identifies two actors as Harry Benham and Frank Crane, but asserts that the two only worked together in 1911.|$|E
500|$|Specimens of Banksia dentata were {{collected}} from {{the vicinity of the}} Endeavour River somewhere between 17 June and 3 August 1770 by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, naturalists on the Endeavour during Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific Ocean. <b>However,</b> <b>the</b> <b>description</b> of the species was not published until April 1782, when Carolus Linnaeus the Younger described the first four Banksia species in his Supplementum Plantarum. Linnaeus distinguished them by their leaf shapes, and named them accordingly. Thus this species' dentate (toothed) leaf margins saw it given the specific name dentata, the Latin adjective for [...] "toothed". Banksia dentata is monotypic, and no subspecies are recognised. Though not closely studied, reports suggest it does not vary significantly over its range.|$|E
