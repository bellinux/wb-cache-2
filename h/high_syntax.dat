40|$|Background: SYNTAX {{score is}} an {{established}} angiographic scoring system for risk stratification {{of a patient}} undergoing coronary revascularization. There was always a theory between cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists that a good outcome after {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) operation needs at least one out of two limbs, either good contractility or good targets. If both are jeopardized the outcome will be suboptimal with considerable risky operation. We performed that study to confirm if vessels with poor distal run-off and high complexity of lesions might affect the outcome in those critical cohorts of patients with poor left ventricular function. Methods: This was a prospective observational non-randomized study. The study included 100 patients with jeopardized left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) 32). 30 days post-operative follow- up was done. The primary end point was the composite criteria of death, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Results: The mean SYNTAX score of the studied cases was 32. 03  ±  9. 62. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar among the three groups. The <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score group showed more increase in total cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) time and cross-clamp time, ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, inotropic support and postoperative blood transfusion than the other two groups. <b>High</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score showed high positive correlation with the number of grafts. No statistically significant difference was found for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) among the three groups (p-value 0. 12). Conclusions: The complexity of coronary lesions and presence of poor targets were not associated with increased adverse outcomes in patients with low EF undergoing CABG. CABG is still the preferred method of revascularization in patients with complex multi-vessel disease and low EF...|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{outcome of}} percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) for unprotected left main coronary artery disease (ULMCAD) remains to be investigated. We identified 1, 005 patients with ULMCAD of 15, 939 patients with first coronary revascularization enrolled in the CREDO-Kyoto PCI/CABG Registry Cohort- 2. Cumulative 3 -year incidence of a composite of death/myocardial infarction (MI) /stroke was significantly higher in the PCI group than in the CABG group (22. 7 % vs 14. 8 %, p = 0. 0006, log-rank test). However, the adjusted outcome was not different between the PCI and CABG groups (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 30, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 30, 95 % confidence interval [CI 0. 79 to 2. 15, p = 0. 30). Stratified analysis using the SYNTAX score demonstrated that risk for a composite of death/MI/stroke was not different between the 2 treatment groups in patients with low (< 23) and intermediate (23 to 33) SYNTAX scores (adjusted HR 1. 70, 95 % CI 0. 77 to 3. 76, p = 0. 19; adjusted HR 0. 86, 95 % CI 0. 37 to 1. 99, p = 0. 72, respectively), whereas in patients with a <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score (≥ 33), it was significantly higher after PCI than after CABG (adjusted HR 2. 61, 95 % CI 1. 32 to 5. 16, p = 0. 006). In conclusion, risk of PCI for serious adverse events seemed to be comparable to that after CABG in patients with ULMCAD with a low or intermediate SYNTAX score, whereas PCI compared with CABG {{was associated with a}} higher risk for serious adverse events in patients with a <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score...|$|E

We investigated {{the relation between the}} SYNTAX score and the occurrence of a periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) according to the historical definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the recently updated universal definition of MI. Methods and results: The SYNTAX score was calculated in 1, 243 patients enrolled in TWENTE, a randomised trial which assessed second-generation drug-eluting stents. PMI was defined by the WHO definition and the third universal definition of MI. Patients were divided into tertiles of the SYNTAX score: ≤ 7 (n= 430); > 7 and < 15 (n= 390); ≥ 15 (n= 423).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Syntax {{score is}} a lesion-based {{angiographic}} scoring system, originally devised to grade the anatomic complexity of {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) and thereby facilitate consensus {{in the study of}} a diagnostic angiogram between surgeons and interventional cardiologists. Suitable biology marker to predict the severity of CAD and to have a treatment decision for revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or bypass surgery, is still unknown. Which biology marker can be a predictor for <b>higher</b> <b>Syntax</b> score remains unknown as well. METHODS: Severity of 105 patients who underwent coronary angiography, were evaluated with Syntax score. Laboratory tests were conducted for routine blood test, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, kidney function, creatinine and hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c). RESULTS: Ureum had significant correlation with Syntax score, p= 0. 016 and 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 05 - 0. 55. Result of logistic regression analysis showed that HDL and haematocrit had significant correlation with Syntax score, with cut off point 34 (p= 0. 02, p= 0. 0033, respectively).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine predictors of mid term major cardiovascular events in 110 cases of unprotected left main PCI. MethodsClinical and angiographic data were collected retrospectively for all patients with LMS, admitted to the cardiology center of Sfax between 2002 and 2013 and for which urgent or scheduled percutaneous revascularization was performed. The occurrence of cardiovascular events, or MACCE: death, MI, heart failure, angina or stroke recurrence was assessed at 12 months. ResultsDuring the study period, 110 patients underwent an unprotected LM PCI. These patients were predominantly male (72. 7 %). The death rate intra – hospital was 4. 5 % and 12 months mortality was 3. 6 %. 31 patients (28. 2 %) had nonfatal events during follow up. The clinical presentation at admission and diabetes were MACCE predictors at 12 months (p= 0. 04 and 0. 05 successively).

We examined 71 patients undergoing both echocardiogram and coronary angiography within 15 days. All patients had normal global and/or regional wall motion on resting echocardiogram. We calculated GLPSS using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. SS was calculated for each group of patients based on the presence and/or the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) : no CAD on angiogram (n= 10, control group), low SS (n= 36, SS< 22) and high SS (n= 25, SS? 22). We hypothesised that GLPSS at rest is inversely correlated with the angiographically derived SS. Age, sex {{and most of the}} risk factors were equally distributed among the groups. There was a significant inverse correlation between GLPSS and SS values (r(2) = 0. 3869, P< 0. 001). This correlation was weaker in the low-SS group (r(2) = 0. 1332, P< 0. 05), whereas it was lost in the high-SS group (r(2) = 0. 0002, P=NS). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified that the optimal cut-off for the detection of high-SS patients was 13. 95 % (sensitivity= 71 %, specificity= 90 %, P< 0. 001).

METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled a total of 3805 consecutive type 2 DM patients aged 60 years and older who underwent their first elective coronary angiography and had their HbA 1 c levels measured at the Chinese PLA General Hospital between December 2005 and December 2012. The complexity of the coronary artery lesions was evaluated using the Syntax score, and the subjects were divided into three groups according to their HbA 1 c levels. Logistic regression and Pearson correlation were used to analyze the association between the measured HbA 1 c levels and Syntax score. RESULTS: The mean age was 72. 3 ± 10. 6 years. The higher HbA 1 c levels were significantly associated with higher Syntax score (p< 0. 001). The unadjusted correlation coefficient of HbA 1 c levels and the Syntax score was 0. 371 (p< 0. 001).

The CIRCULATING CELLS {{study was designed}} to study the role of several cellular mediators of atherosclerosis as biomarkers of coronary artery disease (CAD). An objective and reproducible method for the quantification of CAD extension is required to establish relationships with these potential biomarkers. We sought to analyse the correlation of the SYNTAX score with known CAD risk factors to test it as a valid marker of CAD extension. Methods and results A subgroup of 279 patients (67. 4 % males) were included in our analysis. Main exclusion criteria were a history of previous percutaneous coronary intervention or surgical revascularisation that prevent an accurate assessment of the SS. Diabetes mellitus, smoking, renal insufficiency, body mass index and a history of CAD and myocardial infarction were all positively and strongly associated with a <b>higher</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score after adjustment for the non-modifiable biological factors (age and sex). In the multivariate model, age and male sex, along with smok- ing and renal insufficiency, remain statistical significantly associated with the SYNTAX score.

MethodsA total of 86 clinically stable patients with ULMCA stenosis who were unfit or unwilling for CABG underwent PCI with DES at two tertiary care centers in Kolkata. Patients were followed up prospectively for a median of 34. 6 months for major adverse cardiovascular events. Angiographic follow-up was done after 1 year of index procedure or earlier, if indicated. ResultsFifty-five patients (64 %) had distal left main stenosis. Two-stent technique was used in 19 patients (22 %) and single-stent technique in 36 patients (42 %) with distal left main lesion. Thirteen patients (15. 1 %) had left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 45 %. There was no in-hospital death, MI, or stent thrombosis. During follow-up, major adverse cardiac event (MACE) occurred in 9 patients (10. 5 %). Our study revealed significantly greater MACE in patients with distal left main lesion with LVEF ≤ 45 % (50 % vs 6. 38 %, p= 0. 0002), <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score (36. 36 % vs 6. 82 %, p= 0. 008), and diabetes (17. 95 % vs 0. 00 %, p= 0. 07). Overall, also patients with Diabetes, LVEF ≤ 45 %, and SYNTAX score > 32 had significantly higher MACE. Use of IC Stent, IVUS, or procedural strategy in distal lesion did not affect MACE. ConclusionIn selective patients with low-intermediate SYNTAX score and without diabetes and LV dysfunction, ULMCA PCI with DES is feasible...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: We {{aimed to}} compare the effects of {{coronary}} lesion complexity assessed by SYNTAX (Sx) score on the clinical outcomes in patients who have received BMS versus undergone coronary bypass grafting. Patients and Methods: Our study population consisted of 459 consecutive patients received bare metal stents (n= 265) or coronary bypass grafting (n= 294). The complexity of coronary artery disease was assessed by Sx score. Sx score was classified as tertiles, as follows: low Sx score (≤ 22), intermediate Sx score (23 - 32) and high Sx score (≥ 33). Results: Throughout the study, the intermediate-term incidence of any revascularization was significantly higher in the percutaneous coronary intervention group compared with the coronary bypass grafting group for both overall group and Sx tertiles. The intermediate-term incidence of death from any cause was comparable between the treatment groups in patients with low and intermediate Sx tertiles. However, in patients with high Sx tertile, the intermediate-term incidence of death from any cause was significantly higher in percutaneous coronary intervention group compared with coronary bypass grafting group. In the overall population, adjusted [hazard ratio, 95 % CI: 0. 88 (0. 38 - 2. 05), p= 0. 780) risks for death from any cause were consistently comparable between percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary bypass grafting, whereas adjusted [hazard ratio, 95 % CI: 0. 12 (0. 05 - 0. 30), p< 0. 001] risks for any revascularization were consistently significantly higher in the percutaneous coronary intervention group compared with coronary bypass grafting group.

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} {{factors associated}} with outcomes following rotational atherectomy (RA). Background: RA is {{an effective way to}} mechanically modify heavily calcified lesions before stenting; however its outcomes are not well defined. Methods and Results: Retrospective evaluation of all patients who underwent RA in three large UK centers (Leeds General Infirmary (LGI), Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) and University Hospital of North Staffordshire (UHNS)) from March 2005 to January 2013. Five hundred and eighteen patients had RA with median follow-up period of 22 months. About 68. 3 % were male, 28. 7 % had DM and 34. 6 % were treated because of ACS. Stents were deployed in 97. 3 % of the patients while 30. 7 % of the procedures were performed transradially. Maximum burr was ≤ 1. 75 mm in 85. 5 % and the mean SYNTAX score was 19. 5 [*]±[*] 11. 6. Peri-procedural complications occurred in 6. 4 % and vascular access complications in 1. 9 %. Outcomes in the follow-up period were: MACE 17. 8 %, cardiac death 7. 1 %, MI 11. 7 %, TVR 7. 5 %, all-cause death 13. 7 %, definite stent thrombosis (ST) 1. 4 % and stroke 2. 9 %. Patients with intermediate and <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> scores were more likely to suffer MACE, cardiac death, MI, all-cause death and ST. Patients with a SYNTAX score > 32 {{were also more likely to}} have a peri-procedural complication. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of PVD (P[*]=[*] 0. 026, OR[*]=[*] 2. 0), DM (P[*]=[*] 0. 008, OR[*]=[*] 2. 1), ACS presentation (P[*]=[*] 0. 011, OR[*]=[*] 2. 1) and SYNTAX score ≥ 23 (P[*]=[*] 0. 02, OR[*]=[*] 1. 9) had a significant association with MACE. Conclusions: RA is safe and effective, with high rate of procedural success and relatively low incidence of MACE. PVD, DM, ACS presentation and SYNTAX score were significant predictors for MACE. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to present the notion of higher-dimensional syntax, which is a {{hierarchy}} of languages. Each term of a n-dimensional language will be typed by terms of the underlying n — 1 -dimensional language. This is an application of the emerging higher-dimensional category notions. On the lower dimensions live notions of syntax which are already known. So dimension zero corresponds to words, dimension one corresponds to equation-free algebraic theories and dimension two corresponds to algebraic data types available in programming languages like ML and Haskell. In this paper I show that this hierarchy continues for higher dimensions and contributes new notions of syntax. As expected syntax comes with a structural induction principle which allows definition of several operation. The operations of substitution, unification and type inference have been investigated. Further the operation of recursive iteration schemes like generalised map and fold algorithms have been presented [Weh 98]. This paper concentrates on the issue of a categorical characterisation of <b>higher</b> dimensional <b>syntax</b> using notions which are partly folklore (free monoidal object in a monoidal category) partly are new higher-dimensional category notions. I will characterise <b>higher</b> dimensional <b>syntax</b> as a left globular set having structure of a free Lawvere theory at each dimension with a right action and a right coaction of the lower dimension language. The right action is reminiscent to the substitution property in polymorphic type theories. The right coaction is reminiscent to the minimal typing property of a polymorphic type theory...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundPercutaneous {{coronary}} intervention (PCI) is {{well established}} procedure for management of coronary artery disease. However, up to 50 % of cases associated with myocardial injury with subsequent increased mortality. Currently there is no reliable method to predict this injury. Aim of the workto investigate {{the ability of the}} syntax score to predict peri-procedure myocardial injury (PMI) in patients undergoing PCI. Patients and Methods: This study included 60 patients. They are divided into two groups (1 =Non-diabetics) and (2 =Diabetics) and subjected to: History and physical examination, ECG, echocardiography, calculation of syntax score, PCI and troponin T. ResultsOur study shows highly significant elevation in the troponin level in both groups after PCI, this elevation was more in group (2) (< 0. 001). In all study population the incidence of PMI was low in patients with low syntax score and increased proportionally with the increase in syntax score. We found the syntax score cutoff value for prediction of PMI to be 15 with calculated sensitivity of 95. 3 %, specificity 88. 2 %, predictive value positive 95. 3 % and Predictive value negative 88. 2 %. ConclusionSyntax score has the ability to predict the occurrence of PMI with accepted sensitivity. It can assess the patient risk for development of PMI which could help to rationalize the use of adjunctive therapies as distal embolic protection devices in high risk patients. Also, diabetic patients have higher incidence of complicated coronary lesions, <b>higher</b> <b>syntax</b> score and they are more labile for PMI...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} compare midterm {{clinical}} outcomes of 1 -stop hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) {{for the treatment of}} multivessel coronary artery disease. BackgroundOne-stop HCR has emerged to be a feasible and attractive alternative to CABG and PCI in selected patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. MethodsFrom June 2007 to December 2010, 141 consecutive patients underwent 1 -stop HCR at Fuwai Hospital. Using propensity score methodology, these patients were matched with 2 separate groups of 141 patients who underwent isolated CABG or PCI during the same period. All patients were stratified by the EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation Score) and the SYNTAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) score. Cutoffs for EuroSCORE (low, ≤ 2; medium, > 2 and  24 and < 30; high, ≥ 30) were identified by tertiles. Three groups' cumulative major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (MACCE) rates in each risk tertile were compared. ResultsOne-stop HCR incurred MACCE rate lower than that with PCI (p < 0. 001), but similar to that with CABG (p = 0. 140). After stratification by EuroSCORE or SYNTAX score, the cumulative MACCE rates were similar among the 3 groups in low and medium tertiles. But in the high EuroSCORE tertile, patients who underwent 1 -stop HCR had a lower MACCE rate than did the groups that underwent CABG (p = 0. 030) and PCI (p = 0. 006). Meanwhile, patients with a <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score who underwent 1 -stop HCR had a MACCE rate lower than did those who underwent PCI (p = 0. 002), but similar to that of those who underwent CABG (p = 0. 362).

40|$|ObjectiveSYNTAX study compares {{outcomes}} of {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting with percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with 3 -vessel and/or left main disease. Complexity of coronary artery disease was quantified by the SYNTAX score, which combines anatomic characteristics of each significant lesion. This study aims to clarify whether SYNTAX score affects the outcome of bypass grafting as defined by major adverse cerebrovascular and cardiac events (MACCE) and its components over a 2 -year follow-up period. MethodsOf the 3075 patients enrolled in SYNTAX, 1541 underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (897 randomized controlled trial patients, and 644 registry patients). All patients undergoing bypass grafting were stratified according to their SYNTAX score into 3 tertiles: low (0 – 22), intermediate (22 – 32), and high (≥ 33) complexity. Clinical outcomes up to 2 years after allocation were determined for each group and further risk factor analysis was performed. ResultsRegistry patients had more complex disease {{than those in the}} randomized controlled trial (SYNTAX score: registry 37. 8 ± 13. 3 vs randomized 29. 1 ± 11. 4; P < . 001). At 30 days, overall coronary bypass mortality was 0. 9 % (registry 0. 6 % vs randomized 1. 2 %). MACCE rate at 30 days was 4. 4 % (registry 3. 4 % vs randomized 5. 2 %). SYNTAX score did not significantly affect overall 2 -year MACCE rate of 15. 6 % for low, 14. 3 % for medium, and 15. 4 % for <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> scores. Compared with randomized patients, registry patients had a lower rate of overall MACCE rate (registry 13. 0 % vs randomized 16. 7 %; P = . 046) and repeat revascularization (4. 7 % vs 8. 6 %; P = . 003), whereas other event rates were comparable. Risk factor analysis revealed left main disease (P = . 049) and incomplete revascularization (P = . 005) as predictive for adverse 2 -year outcomes. ConclusionsThe outcome of coronary artery bypass grafting was excellent and independent from the SYNTAX score.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThere are no data {{available}} on specific causes of death from randomized trials that have compared coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). ObjectivesThe {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate specific causes of death, and its predictors, after revascularization for complex coronary disease in patients. MethodsAn independent Clinical Events Committee consisting of expert physicians who were blinded to the study treatment subclassified causes of death as cardiovascular (cardiac and vascular), noncardiovascular, or undetermined according to the trial protocol. Cardiac deaths were classified as sudden cardiac, related to myocardial infarction (MI), and other cardiac deaths. ResultsIn the randomized cohort, there were 97 deaths after CABG and 123 deaths after PCI during a 5 -year follow-up. After CABG, 49. 4 % of deaths were cardiovascular, with the greatest cause being heart failure, arrhythmia, or other causes (24. 6 %), whereas after PCI, the majority of deaths were cardiovascular (67. 5 %) and as a result of MI (29. 3 %). The cumulative incidence rates of all-cause death were not significantly different between CABG and PCI (11. 4 % vs. 13. 9 %, respectively; p = 0. 10), whereas there were significant differences in terms of cardiovascular (5. 8 % vs. 9. 6 %, respectively; p = 0. 008) and cardiac death (5. 3 % vs. 9. 0 %, respectively; p = 0. 003), which were caused primarily by a reduction in MI-related death with CABG compared with PCI (0. 4 % vs. 4. 1 %, respectively; p < 0. 0001). Treatment with PCI versus CABG was an independent predictor of cardiac death (hazard ratio: 1. 55; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 09 to 2. 33; p = 0. 045). The difference in MI-related death was seen largely in patients with diabetes, 3 -vessel disease, or <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> (TAXUS Drug-Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for the Treatment of Narrowed Arteries) trial scores. ConclusionsDuring a 5 -year follow-up, CABG in comparison with PCI was associated with a significantly reduced rate of MI-related death, which was the leading cause of death after PCI. Treatments following PCI should target reducing post-revascularization spontaneous MI. Furthermore, secondary preventive medication remains essential in reducing events post-revascularization.

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{have been}} shown to be {{associated}} with various physiological and pathological conditions, including inflammation and cardiovascular disease, but little is known about their relationship with the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and disease severity. A total of 195 consecutive subjects who underwent coronary angiography for chest pain evaluation were enrolled in this study. In CAD patients severity of coronary lesions was assessed by the number of diseased vessels and the Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac surgery score (SYNTAX score). Plasma levels of miRNA- 145 were quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction test, and logarithmic transformation of miRNA- 145 levels (Ln_miRNA- 145) was used for analyses due to its skewed distribution. Of the 195 total subjects 167 patients were diagnosed as having CAD. Ln_miRNA- 145 was significantly lower in CAD patients compared with the non-CAD group (- 6. 11 ± 0. 92 vs. - 5. 06 ± 1. 25; p < 0. 001). In multivariable linear regression analyses CAD was significantly associated with lower Ln_miRNA- 145 (Estimate, - 0. 50; standard error (SE), 0. 11; p < 0. 0001). Furthermore, among CAD patients, three-vessel disease, <b>higher</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> scores and STEMI were significantly associated with lower Ln_miRNA- 145 ([Estimate, - 0. 40; SE, 0. 07; p < 0. 0001]; [Estimate, - 0. 02, SE, 0. 10; p = 0. 005] and [Estimate, - 0. 35, SE, 0. 10; p < 0. 001] respectively). Lower plasma levels of miRNA- 145 were significantly associated with the presence as well as severity of CAD. As a potential biomarker for CAD, plasma miRNA- 145 may be useful in predicting CAD and its severity in patients presenting with chest pain...|$|R
