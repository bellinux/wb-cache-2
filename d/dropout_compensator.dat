Thus various modern video recordings of 405-line programming also exist. Betamax was sometimes preferred for this, as the <b>Dropout</b> <b>Compensator</b> could be switched off on certain models for use with PCM digital audio decoders.|$|E
50|$|In March 1984, Pioneer {{introduced}} the first consumer player with a solid-state laser, the LD-700. It {{was also the}} first LD player to load from the front and not the top. One year earlier Hitachi introduced an expensive industrial player with a laser diode, but the player, which had poor picture quality due to an inadequate <b>dropout</b> <b>compensator,</b> was made only in limited quantities. After Pioneer released the LD-700, gas lasers were no longer used in consumer players, despite their advantages, although Philips continued to use gas lasers in their industrial units until 1985.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{concerned}} with the stability analysis and the design of stabilizing compensation-based control algorithms for networked control systems (NCSs) that exhibit packet dropouts. We propose a new type of model-based <b>dropout</b> <b>compensator,</b> which depends on the local dropout history, and we provide LMI-based conditions for their synthesis. The analysis and design framework includes stochastic models to describe the packet dropout behavior in both the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channel. Via examples we demonstrate the significantly improved robustness with respect to packet dropouts using the proposed <b>dropout</b> <b>compensator,</b> compared to using the zero strategy and the hold strategy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} optimal {{compensation for}} dropped feedback measurements in a networked control system. A common policy for handling such lost data {{is to simply}} use the past data. This case was treated in [8]. This paper extends that prior work to cover a more general class of dropout compensation. The paper's principal result shows that determining the optimal <b>dropout</b> <b>compensator</b> can be posed as a constrained generalized regulator problem. An example compares {{the performance of a}} networked control system using the optimal <b>dropout</b> <b>compensator</b> against more commonly used heuristic dropout policies. The comparison shows that the optimal compensator works better than these heuristic policies. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we are {{concerned}} with the stability analysis and the design of stabilising compensation-based control algorithms for networked control systems (NCSs) that exhibit packet dropouts. In order to increase the robustness against packet dropouts for such NCSs, we propose a new type of model-based <b>dropout</b> <b>compensator,</b> which depends on the local dropout history. Moreover, we provide linear matrix inequality based synthesis conditions for such compensators guaranteeing robust stability. The analysis and design framework includes both worst-case-bound and stochastic models to describe the packet-dropout behaviour in both the sensor-to-controller and the controller-to-actuator channels. Numerical examples demonstrate the significantly improved robustness with respect to packet dropouts using the proposed <b>dropout</b> <b>compensator,</b> compared to using the existing zero strategy and the hold strategy...|$|E
40|$|ISBN: 978 - 1 - 4244 - 3908 - 9 International audiencePacket dropout {{is one of}} the {{key issues}} which degrade {{performances}} of Internet-based Control System(ICS). An integrated strategy composed of active part and passive part to solve this problem is proposed in this paper. In the active part, the priority of control packets in ICS can be improved through differentiated services which decrease probability of control packet dropout. While in the passive part, a data packet <b>dropout</b> <b>compensator</b> is established to reduce the negative influence of packet dropout. The sufficient conditions for stabilizing the new result model are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). At last, the solvability and effectiveness of the results is evaluated using NS 2...|$|E
