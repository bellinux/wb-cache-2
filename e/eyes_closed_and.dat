5|$|Potbelly monuments are {{generally}} crude in-the-round sculptures of extremely fat human figures; {{they are usually}} seated cross-legged and have enormous swollen stomachs gripped in the figure's arms and legs. The heads are round and normally have the <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> possess puffy eyelids and prominent lips. The monuments {{are generally}} of indeterminate gender and are usually carved from porphyritic basalt, a kind of rock {{with a combination of}} large and small grains of mineral that is common along the foothills of Central America. There are occasional examples of potbelly figures crafted from other materials, such as pottery or from other types of rock.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Amy and {{the clerics}} find the Angels {{moving away from}} the primary control room. One cleric goes to investigate, and finds the crack has grown wider, but then is soon {{consumed}} by it. Amy remembers this cleric, but none of the others do, as he had been erased from time. The crack continues to grow, and soon the other clerics are similarly consumed. The Doctor directs Amy to keep her <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> work her way to the secondary control room, hoping that the Angels will not recognise that her eyes are shut. Amy falters and trips, but as the Angels move in, River is able to teleport her to the secondary control room, rescuing her.|$|E
5|$|When {{they arise}} in the spring, the females go to nursery colonies which may often be the same place where they were born. These nursery colonies consist mainly of adult females and their young and can {{be located in the}} attics of warm {{buildings}} where there is high humidity. These colonies sometimes reach numbers of bats as great as 1,000 per cave/forest. Gestation lasts 50–60 days. They usually have one baby per female each year, sometimes twins, born sometime from late May to early July. The young are born in an altricial state with their <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> will hang in the nursery while their mothers forage at night. Their eyes open on their second day. They cling to a nipple constantly until they are two weeks old. At three weeks, they learn to fly. By four weeks, they are adult sized. Females may be sexually mature in the fall after their birth, but males may take a year longer. About half of females and most males breed during their first autumn.|$|E

5|$|The next day, a Nazi U-boat appears and {{intercepts}} the ship. Belloq and Dietrich {{seize the}} Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels {{with them to}} {{an island in the}} Aegean Sea. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with a panzerfaust, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact. The Nazis take Indy and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark, which appears to contain nothing but sand, all that remains of the Ten Commandments. Suddenly, angelic ghost-like beings emerge from the Ark. Indy cautions Marion to keep her <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> not to observe what happens next. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the apparitions are suddenly revealed to be angels of death. A vortex of flame forms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. As Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror, the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Indy and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.|$|E

500|$|In May 2009, Tovey {{announced}} that she had filmed her final scenes with Home and Away. Lasance said he was sad but [...] "fortunate" [...] to work alongside Tovey. He credited their off-screen friendship as making Aden and Belle's dynamic develop successfully. In the weeks before filming her final scenes, Tovey asked Welsh how Belle would be written out. It was then she found out that Belle would die shortly after her wedding with Aden. Tovey said she was teary, but pleased with the way Belle would depart. Tovey said that filming her exit scenes were more emotional. Her last scene with Lasance required her to portray Belle's death scene. She added [...] "I had my <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> he was holding me really tight", after the director cut the scene they pair could not separate themselves.|$|E
500|$|With {{the release}} of Tool's {{follow-up}} single [...] "Prison Sex", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: [...] "It {{took so long to}} remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> my throat wide open." [...] The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his [...] "surrealistic interpretation" [...] of the subject matter. And while some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as [...] "metaphoric", the American branch of MuchMusic asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.|$|E
500|$|Some frogs use bluff or deception. The European {{common toad}} (Bufo bufo) adopts a {{characteristic}} stance when attacked, inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered. The bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) crouches down with <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> head tipped forward when threatened. This places the parotoid glands {{in the most}} effective position, the other glands on its back begin to ooze noxious secretions and the most vulnerable parts of its body are protected. Another tactic used by some frogs is to [...] "scream", the sudden loud noise tending to startle the predator. The gray tree frog (Hyla versicolor) makes an explosive sound that sometimes repels the shrew Blarina brevicauda. Although toads are avoided by many predators, the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) regularly feeds on them. The strategy employed by juvenile American toads (Bufo americanus) on being approached by a snake is to crouch down and remain immobile. This is usually successful, with the snake passing by and the toad remaining undetected. If it is encountered by the snake's head, however, the toad hops away before crouching defensively.|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} grew uncomfortable with their success, {{with much of}} the burden of Pearl Jam's {{popularity}} falling on frontman Vedder. While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for [...] "Jeremy", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for [...] "Black" [...] in spite of pressure from the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs. Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed listeners from creating their own interpretations of the song, stating that [...] "Before music videos first came out, you’d listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> <b>and</b> you’d come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Fanaa, Kajol worked {{intermittently}} {{through the rest of}} the decade. She next starred in her husband's directorial debut, the drama U Me Aur Hum (2008) as Piya, a woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Devgn described Kajol's participation in the project by saying, [...] "She is always thorough with the nitty-gritties of her character before she begins shooting. Since the screenplay work happened at home, Kajol was present for all the sittings and even gave her inputs." [...] Upon release, the film performed moderately well at the box office and earned positive critical reviews for her performance. Udita Jhunjhunwala noted, [...] "Kajol completely comes into her own here as an ailing woman unaware of her vulnerability and delicate situation. She is superb." [...] Raja Sen added, [...] " [...] can span through happy-breezy with her <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> <b>and</b> so the first half doesn't even pose her a challenge, but when Alzheimer's strikes Piya and she begins to forget all that matters in her life, Kajol raises the bar strikingly high." [...] The following year, Kajol received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards ceremony.|$|E

[...] Jon Young of Spin recommended that the record is [...] "best absorbed in small portions, allowing you to savor the seriously catchy melodies and uplifting vibes," [...] feeling that the songs blur together when consumed at once.

2500|$|In Taoism {{and many}} {{traditional}} Chinese religious sects such as Chan (called Zen in Japanese), [...] "third eye training" [...] involves focusing {{attention on the}} point between the eyebrows with the <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> <b>and</b> while the body is in various qigong postures.

Taoism claims that the third eye is one of the main energy centers of the body located at the sixth chakra, forming a part of the main meridian, the line separating left and right hemispheres of the body.

2500|$|The accuser's 14-year-old brother Star {{testified that}} he'd walked into Jackson's bedroom and seen Jackson masturbating {{himself and the}} {{sleeping}} accuser. He testified that he'd meant {{to go to sleep}} in Jackson's room, had found the door [...] "kind of locked, so [...] pushed it, and it opened," [...] and he walked some ways into the room and stopped when he saw what Gavin and Michael were doing. He testified they were on the bed [...] "outside of the covers," [...] Jackson was on his back with his <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> <b>and</b> Gavin was [...] "curled up" [...] facing away from Jackson and was [...] "kind of snoring." [...] Star couldn't remember what his brother had been wearing but said it might have been [...] "pants or underwears," [...] and that Jackson was wearing [...] "socks, underwears, and an undershirt," [...] but later said Jackson's [...] "hand was in his pants." [...] He variously used the words [...] "pants" [...] and [...] "underwears" [...] for both Gavin and Jackson to describe what they were wearing. One aspect that weakened his testimony was that Star, the only witness to the alleged molestation, claimed he twice walked in on Jackson molesting Gavin and was completely unnoticed, even while tripping the alarm system in the hallway leading to Jackson's bedroom. An alarm or bell would sound whenever anyone approached, and Star claimed that on both occasions the alarm went off and Jackson didn't hear it. Neither did he hear nor see the boy come and go. Star said he stood watching for about four seconds before he [...] "just went back to the guest units." [...] Star testified that two days later he had an almost identical experience. He allegedly walked into Jackson's bedroom and saw that [...] "the same thing was happening," [...] with Jackson [...] "masturbating, stroking up and down" [...] and his other hand moving around in Star's sleeping [...] "brother's underwears." [...] This time Star only stayed for three seconds before returning to the guest units. Star's account of the sexual act on the second occasion matched neither the description he gave during an interview with psychologist Stanley Katz nor his statement given in police interviews in 2003. Star Arvizo {{said in an interview with}} the psychologist on May 29, 2003, that he witnessed Jackson placing his hand on Gavin's crotch outside his clothes. On July 7, 2003, during his first interview with sheriff's investigators, Star changed his story. He claimed that during the first incident Jackson placed his left hand under the front of his brother's pajama pants. Star Arvizo changed his account still a third time during a police interview on August 13, 2003, when he claimed that Jackson had placed his hand inside the front of his brother's boxer shorts. Dr. Katz' grand jury testimony about what Star had told him included a story about Jackson [...] "rubbing his penis against Gavin's buttocks" [...] and another about smelling marijuana. In court, Star denied that he'd made the allegations and refused Mesereau's offer to [...] "refresh [...] recollection [...] that page of [...] testimony." ...|$|E
