It also means that coupon payments are not at fixed intervals starting from the trade date - payment dates are fixed on the 20th of March, June, September, and December. This means that the first coupon period may be a different length to the others. To offset the difference between traded spread and running spread, and the accrual from the first coupon period, an upfront fee is paid.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the paper}} {{is to provide a}} {{comprehensive}} assessment of the impact of infrastructure development on growth in African countries. Based on econometric estimates for a sample of 136 countries from 1960 - 2005, the authors evaluate the impact on per capita growth of faster accumulation of infrastructure stocks and of enhancement in the quality of infrastructure services for 39 African countries in three key infrastructure sectors: telecommunications, electricity, and roads. Using an econometric technique suitable for dynamic panel data models and likely endogenous regressors, the authors find that infrastructure stocks and service quality boost economic growth. The growth payoff of reaching the infrastructure development of the African leader (Mauritius) is 1. 1 percent of GDP per year in North Africa and 2. 3 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa, with most of the contribution coming from more, rather than better, infrastructure. Across Africa, infrastructure contributed 99 <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> to per capita economic growth, versus 68 points for other structural policies. Most of the contribution came from increases <b>in</b> stocks (89 <b>basis</b> <b>points),</b> versus quality improvements (10 <b>basis</b> <b>points).</b> The findings show that growth is positively affected by the volume of infrastructure stocks and the quality of infrastructure services; simulations show that our empirical findings are significant statistically and economically. Identifying areas of opportunity to generate productivity growth, the authors find that African countries are likely to gain more from larger stocks of infrastructure than from enhancements in the quality of existing infrastructure. The payoffs are largest for telephone density, electricity-generating capacity, road-network length, and road quality.

40|$|Syndicated {{loans and}} the number of lending {{relationships}} have raised growing attention. All other terms being equal (e. g. seniority), syndicated loans provide larger payments (<b>in</b> <b>basis</b> <b>points)</b> to lenders funding larger amounts. The paper explores empirically the motivation for such a price discrimination on sovereign syndicated loans in the period 1990 - 1997. First evidence suggests larger premia are associated with renegotiation prospects. This is consistent with the hypothesis that price discrimination is aimed at reducing the number of lenders and thus the expected renegotiation costs. However, larger payment discrimination is also associated with more targeted market segments and with larger loans, thus minimising borrowing costs and/or attempting to widen the circle of lending relationships in order to successfully raise the requested amount.

40|$|Amodel {{of market}} {{microstructure}} invariance is presented {{based on the}} intuition that stocks with high {{and low levels of}} trading activity differ in {{the rate at which the}} time clock generating trading activity ticks. This model as well as two alternative benchmark models are consistent with traditional adverse selection and inventory models. The model is tested using a database of over 400, 000 portfolio transition trades provided by a leading vendor of portfolio transition services. In a pooled cross-section of stocks, holding volatility constant, the model of market microstructure invariance predicts that a one percent increase in trading activity leads to a decrease of two-thirds of one percent in mean portfolio transition order size as a fraction of expected daily volume, leads to no change in the higher moments of the distribution of order size, leads to an increase in market impact costs (measured <b>in</b> <b>basis</b> <b>points)</b> of one-third of one percent for trading a given percentage of expected daily trading volume, and leads to a decrease in bid-ask spreads of one-third of one percent. Compared with the predictions of alternative models, empirical results match closely the predictions of the model of market microstructure invariance, with order size conforming closely to a log-normal distribution. The result is a simple empirical transaction cost formula for stocks, which estimates market impact and bid-ask spread costs as a function of dollar trade size, average daily dollar volume, and volatility. ∗We are grateful to Georgios Skoulakis, Mark Loewenstein, and Vish Viswanathan for helpful comments.

40|$|As a {{response}} to the need for credit risk protection, the credit derivatives market has seen substantial growth over the past few years. While the deteriorating credit status {{of a large number of}} issuers in 2002 contributed to the expansion of this market, this growth can also be ascribed to the broadening of the uses to which these credit derivatives are put, above and beyond their original function of providing protection. This article describes how credit default swaps (CDSs) work and how they are used, CDSs accounting for the lion’s share of the credit derivatives market. One characteristic feature of CDSs is their premium, which is expressed <b>in</b> <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> and constitutes the periodic cost of purchasing protection. As an initial approximation, this premium may be regarded as being equivalent to the spread between the bonds issued by reference entities (the risk on which the derivatives are used to hedge) and the level of the swap curve; however, for technical reasons this is not in fact the case. This differential between the CDS premium and the bond yield spread – commonly known as the basis – encourages the use of CDSs as a new instrument for arbitrage, investment and position-taking on the credit market. In addition to credit risk hedging, arbitrage strategies are put in place to take advantage of the fluctuations in the basis and thus obtain maximum benefit from the now recognised blurring of boundaries between the bond and credit derivatives markets. An illustration is given of their use in the context of sovereign risk. As one of the original sources of demand for protection, the sovereign CDS market constitutes an ideal testing ground for strategies regarding credit derivatives instruments. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether {{leverage}} has a significant statistical and economic effect on the pricing of S&P 500 index options. This is the first paper to directly test for leverage effects in stock index options. To analyze these effects we use the Geske (1979) compound option model. The Geske model is closed form, implies stochastic equity volatility, is consistent with Modigliani and Miller, incorporates debt refinancing, and includes possibly differential default and bankruptcy. Black-Scholes (1973) is a special case of the Geske model. In this paper we show that during the years 1996 - 2004 the aggregate market based debt to equity (D/E) ratio of the firms comprising the S&P 500 equity index varies from about 40 - 120 percent. We believe this is the first presentation of a market D/E ratio derived from option theory. Next and more importantly we are the first to report the details of the statistically significant economic effects that market leverage has on pricing S&P 500 index call options. We measure that the Geske model improves the net option valuation of listed in the money (or out of the money) S&P 500 index call options on average by about 35 % (28 %) compared to Black-Scholes values. We demonstrate that the improvement is directly (and monotonically) related to both the time to expiration of the option and the amount of leverage in this market index. For options with longer expirations and/or periods of higher market leverage the improvement is greater, ranging from about 40 % to 80 %. We also demonstrate economic significance <b>in</b> <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> by showing that dealers making a book in index options can expect benefits of at least several 100 basis points using Geske instead of Black-Scholes...|$|E

Purposes were to: (a) {{add to the}} professional knowledge base about advanced refundings; (b) evaluate the financial consequences on taxpayers; (c) determine benefits as measured by interest rates, terms, and payment amounts; (d) determine whether selected financial conditions and demographic variables impacted refunding outcomes. The population was all instances of advanced refundings by Indiana public {{school districts in the}} period studied. Data were collected from the bond transcripts prepared by legal counsels and placed in tabulation forms developed for the project. Primary findings included:(a) Three quarters of the refunding occurred in the first 10 years of the paymentstream; 27 % occurred in the first four years. (b) As the size of the issue increased, the cost (as a percentage of the issue) decreased. (c) Mean decrease in interest rate for the refizndings was. 023915 or 239 basis points. (d) Net fiscal impact was generally positive, with a mean savings of $ 224, 218. (e) A negative correlation existed between district wealth and annual paymentamount (i. e., districts with high assessed valuations had smaller changes inannual payments). (f) A positive correlation existed between interest rate change and refunding amount (i. e., large issues were more sensitive to slight changes in interest rates). Selected conclusions included:(a) The benefits of refunding diminished with time (i. e., greatest benefits are likely {{in the first quarter of}} the payment stream). (b) Some refundings occurred when the decline <b>in</b> <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> was below a standard level used for municipal bonds; this suggests that school officials may engage in refundings for reasons that extend beyond savings (e. g., political benefits). (c) An economy of scale between refunding size and costs supports existing research. (d) Costs for local school district counsel varied considerably, suggesting that no compensation standard was used. (e) Wealthier districts were less interested in lowering annual payments; their pursuit of refunding may have been motivated by flexibility (i. e., shortening the debt life, accessing fiscal resources). (f) Districts with large bond issues benefited from refunding even when the declines in interest rates were slight. Eight recommendations were formalized.
