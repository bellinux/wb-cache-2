25|$|Charles Thomas Payne is Madelyn Dunham's {{younger brother}} and Obama's great-uncle. He {{was born in}} 1925. Payne served during World War II in the U.S. Army 89th Infantry Division. Obama has often {{described}} Payne's role in liberating the Ohrdruf forced labor camp. There was brief media attention when Obama mistakenly identified the camp as Auschwitz during the campaign. In 2009, Payne spoke about his war experience: Ohrdruf was in that string of towns going across, south of Gotha and Erfurt. Our division {{was the first one}} in there. When we arrived there were no German soldiers anywhere around that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about.</b> There was no fighting against the Germans, no camp guards. The whole area was overrun by people from the camp dressed in the most pitiful rags, and most of them were in a bad state of starvation.|$|E
500|$|As the {{psychologist}} and computer scientist Christopher Evans has noted, [...] "One aspect of [...] war record {{that is particularly}} confused, and again typical {{of the mixture of}} glamour and obscurantism which surrounds Hubbard and his past, is the matter of wounds or injuries suffered on active service." [...] Hubbard asserted after the war that he had been [...] "blinded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back... Yet I worked my way back to fitness and strength in less than two years, using only what <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> Man and his relationship to the universe." [...] Accounts published by the Church of Scientology asserted that he had been [...] "flown home in the late spring of 1942 in the secretary of the Navy's private plane as the first U.S.-returned casualty from the Far East". A 2006 publication goes further, describing him as [...] "the first American casualty of South Pacific combat".|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to write the episode however, Kaling had to perform a Google search, as she had {{forgotten}} many details. She explained, [...] "I was a little embarrassed with how little <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> it. I'm Hindu, but I'm not really a practicing Hindu, so I had {{to do a lot of}} research." [...] Kaling was pleased to learn more about her culture, at first being concerned that Daniels [...] "and people I work with were a little antsy about assigning the Hindu writer the Indian episode. I didn't want to feel like they pigeonholed me, but I felt like I'd done enough episodes that it was okay." [...] She found that making the episode [...] "was kind of the perfect meeting of being the child of immigrants and writing for a comedy show." [...] The series writers have since joked that they should do a Diwali-themed episode every year in the same vein as the Christmas specials.|$|E

500|$|Elisabeth Moss {{said she}} was not told by Weiner that Peggy would be leaving SCDP [...] "until we were {{shooting}} episode 10, the one right before it. It was unusual that he didn't tell me. He usually tells me what's happening, pitches me things to ask me how they sound." [...] Moss' initial reaction [...] "was just one of feeling like {{there was really no}} other logical way to go for her. After everything that had happened for five years, she can't just keep butting her head up against that wall. [...] She's becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under Don." [...] Moss also said, [...] "I will thank [...] forever for not telling me. It would have made my life harder. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> Peggy's baby in season one. I fought against it, to play it as she was living it, feeling it, and not be in my head. Not knowing Peggy would quit allowed me to find it for myself, to really feel Peggy's growing frustration with Don all season." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Joel H. Cohen, {{and it was his}} first sole writing credit for a Treehouse of Horror episode. He {{previously}} wrote the [...] "Hex and the City" [...] segment of season 13's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XII". Bob Anderson served as director. It was his third Treehouse of Horror episode, the first two being season seven's [...] "Treehouse of Horror VI" [...] and season 20's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XIX". Daniel Radcliffe, star of the Harry Potter film series, guest starred as Edmund in the third segment which parodies the Twilight novel and film series. Radcliffe said that he is a fan of the show and guest starring is [...] "a huge honour. The Halloween episode has become a big tradition in The Simpsons so I'm very excited to be part of it. There was a time when I was 12 or 13 when 50 percent of everything <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the world came from The Simpsons, so this is a big deal." [...] Hugh Laurie of Blackadder and House guest starred as Roger in [...] "Master and Cadaver".|$|E
500|$|While Sherwood Smith {{originally}} wrote Crown Duel as {{two separate}} books entitled Crown Duel (1997) and Court Duel (1998), she considered them as [...] "one story." [...] Both novels explore the fictional land of Sartorias-deles, {{the world she}} has been writing about since her youth. Smith grew up wondering why [...] " [...] the way [...] " [...] for instance observing, [...] "Why were the cities so clean, I wondered when I was a kid. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> sewers, etc. Why {{is it safe to}} drink from a stream there, and not here?". She conceived Sartorias-deles as a world where, {{over the course of several}} centuries, humans of many different races entered through [...] "worldgates" [...] and were influenced by the culture of its indigenous beings. According to Smith, while her invented world was not perfect, it contains fewer problems than Earth has endured, such as disease and overpopulation. She wrote, [...] "basically, the indigenous life forms, appalled by these things that came through and started multiplying and spreading out, carrying their diseases and wars, tried to fix things for the humans... Their history is not all happy, it's very strange, and humans still have many human problems, but in other ways they are somewhat different from [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|Beckett {{refrained from}} elaborating on the {{characters}} beyond {{what he had}} written in the play. He once recalled that when Sir Ralph Richardson [...] "wanted the low-down on Pozzo, his home address and curriculum vitae, and seemed to make the forthcoming of this and similar information the condition of his condescending to illustrate the part of Vladimir ... I told him that all <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> Pozzo was in the text, that if I had known more I would have {{put it in the}} text, and that was true also of the other characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another Hoover biographer {{who heard}} the rumors of {{homosexuality}} and blackmail, however, {{said he was}} unable to corroborate them, though it has been acknowledged that Lansky and other organized crime figures had frequently been allowed to visit the Del Charro Hotel in La Jolla, California, which was owned by Hoover's friend, and staunch Lyndon Johnson supporter, Clint Murchison, Sr. Hoover and Tolson also frequently visited the Del Charro Hotel. Summers quoted a source named Charles Krebs as saying, [...] "on three occasions that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about,</b> maybe four, boys were driven down to La Jolla at Hoover's request." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clancey has {{explained}} this work more simply as follows: “I worked with social scientists (anthropologists, sociologists, and educational psychologists)....We observed people in businesses (such as a customer call center) {{to understand how}} learning naturally occurs. We emphasized how people succeed in doing their work despite having inadequate tools or incomplete procedures, by studying how they helped and learned from each other.” He has also said that his “broad college background in computer science, philosophy, and anthropology...helped me understand the social scientists at the Institute for Research on Learning, so I could relate what <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> computer science to what they knew about people.” ...|$|E

2500|$|African-American {{hair has}} been through many {{different}} cycles. Slavery {{played a major role}} in the ups and downs of the pride that African-Americans take in their hair. [...] "Everything <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> American history I learned from looking at Black people's hair. It's the perfect metaphor for the African experiment here: the price of the ticket (for a journey no one elected to take), the toll of slavery, and the costs remaining. It's all in the hair. Like Jamaica Kincaid, who writes only about a character named Mother, I've decided to write only about hair: what we do to it, how we do it, and why. I figure this is enough," [...] said Lisa Jones in an essay titled Hair Always and Forever.|$|E
2500|$|The soundtrack was {{composed}} by Rolfe Kent who previously composed music for Reitman's Thank You for Smoking (2005), Up in the Air (2009) and Young Adult (2011). The album features I'm Going Home from Arlo Guthrie and Here Before from Vashti Bunyan. It also contains guitar pieces by Andrés Segovia and Shin-Ichi Fukuda. Talking about the music, Kent said that [...] "You know it’s simple to compose happy or sad music, but {{to create something}} simple yet sophisticated, that calls the listener to be curious and yet uncertain and perhaps a little unnerved, well it called me to forget everything <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> composition and discover a whole new musical language. It was at once incredibly stressful, and deeply rewarding." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cutler was {{selected}} by the Denver Broncos {{in the first round}} with the 11th pick in the draft, acquired from the St. Louis Rams for their 1st and 3rd round picks. Many believed Cutler was chosen by the Broncos due to the lackluster performance in the previous season's [...] of Jake Plummer. After the pick by Denver, Cutler said, [...] "We had no warning. I think <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> 15 seconds before everyone else did." [...] Cutler, as predicted by most, was the third quarterback chosen, after Young (3rd overall) and Leinart (10th). He is the third first-round pick to come from Vanderbilt, preceded by Will Wolford and Bill Wade. On July 27, 2006, Cutler agreed to terms on a six-year $48 million contract, which included $11 million in bonuses.|$|E

2500|$|In 1976 Ginn {{formed the}} punk rock band Panic. Panic {{recorded}} eight songs in January 1978, but no labels {{were interested in}} releasing the music aside from Los Angeles, California record label Bomp! Records. By late 1978 Bomp had still not formally agreed to release the music on record, so Ginn decided he had enough business experience with SST to release it himself. Pressing records {{turned out to be}} a simple matter; [...] "I just looked in the phone book under record pressing plants and there was one there", Ginn recalled, [...] "and so I just took it to them and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> printing because I had always done catalogs." [...] SST Records released the music recorded by Ginn's band (now named Black Flag) as the Nervous Breakdown EP in January 1979.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1984 {{interview}} Kirby said [...] "I did {{a version}} of Thor for D.C. in the fifties before I did him for Marvel.

I tried to update Thor and put him into a superhero costume, {{but he was still}} Thor." [...] The story was included in Tales of the Unexpected #16, from 1957; and although the character had a different design, some details would be reused by Kirby when he created the Marvel Comics version. And in a 1992 interview, Kirby said [...] " [...] knew the Thor legends very well, but I wanted to modernize them. I felt that might be a new thing for comics, taking the old legends and modernizing them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ludlow’s {{writings}} led addicts {{from all}} over the country to write for advice, and he spent a great deal of time in his last years answering this correspondence. He also treated addicts as a physician, and one friend said that “I have known him to go for three weeks at a time without taking off his clothing for sleep, in attendance upon the sick. His face was a familiar one in many a hospital ward.... During the last weeks of his residence in New York, he supported, out of his scanty means, a family of which one of the members had been a victim to opium. This family had no claim upon him whatever excepting that of the sympathy which such misfortunes always excited in him. The medicines and money he furnished this single family in the course of the several weeks that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> them, could not have amounted to less than one hundred dollars, and this case was only one of many.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Greg Vaughan, who had {{recently}} been let go from his role as Diego Guittierez on The Young and the Restless, was cast shortly thereafter and first appeared on February 20, 2003. Vaughan later described his screen test to Soap Opera Digest: [...] "I {{was a little bit}} intimidated. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the character, the foundation of the story. I knew it was a difficult task that I was about to take on." [...] In July 2009, Vaughan denied rumors that he was being let go or put on recurring status. That September, ABC announced that Vaughan had decided to leave to explore other opportunities, and that Jackson would be reprising the role. However, Vaughan announced via Twitter that it was the network that decided to let him go. Jackson stated upon returning: [...] "It was a tough situation. I was not under any sort of headspace that someone was losing their job; it was that the role was opening up. (...) It was more of a confusing thing for me coming back and not knowing exactly what was going on, {{on the other end of}} things." [...] Vaughan last aired on October 20, 2009, while Jackson first aired on October 27, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|DeVille {{recorded}} Miracle in London with Mark Knopfler {{serving as}} his sideman and producer. He said, [...] "It was Mark (Knopfler’s) wife Lourdes {{who came up}} with the idea (to record Miracle). She said to him that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?" [...] "Storybook Love", a song from Miracle and the theme song of the movie The Princess Bride, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's Academy Awards telecast.Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> this movie he was doing. It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. About six or seven months later, I was half asleep when the phone rang. It was the Academy of Arts and Sciences with the whole spiel. I hung up on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) answered the phone. She came in to tell me that I was nominated for [...] "Storybook Love." [...] It's pretty wild. It's not the Grammys — it's the Academy Awards, which is different for a musician. Before I knew it, I was performing on the awards show with Little Richard. It was the year of Dirty Dancing, and they won.|$|E
2500|$|The IG report {{did find}} that some {{statements}} made by Gonzales at a March 13, 2007 press conference about his involvement were inaccurate. [...] The report however does not conclude that Gonzales deliberately provided false information. [...] He acknowledged from the outset his misstatements, accepted responsibility, and attempted {{to set the record}} straight well before congressional testimony on April 19, 2007. [...] Gonzales testified 18 months before the IG reports that statements he made at the March 13, 2007 press conference were misstatements and were overboard. [...] Further, in his written statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, presented April 19, 2007, Gonzales wrote: [...] "I misspoke at a press conference on March 13th when I said that I [...] "was not involved in any discussions about what was going on." [...] That statement was too broad. [...] At that same press conference, I made clear that I was aware of the process; I said, [...] "I knew my Chief of Staff was involved in the process of determining who were the weak performers, where were the districts around the country where we could do better for the people in that district, and that's what I knew". [...] Of course, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the process because of, at a minimum, these discussions with Mr. Sampson. [...] Thus, my statement about [...] "discussions" [...] was imprecise and overboard, but it certainly was not in any way an attempt to mislead the American people." ...|$|E
