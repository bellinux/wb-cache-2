After backing weld of double-sided synchronous TIG, the regular TIG and SMAW will be carried out respectively to process the <b>filling</b> <b>welding.</b> The microstructures and mechanical properties of two kinds of joints are analyzed, the result shows that the impact energy at - 196 ̊C in different zones of two joints reach to 70 J and more, the lower heat input of TIG is more favorable for improving the impact toughness of joints. And the weld metal strength is lower than that of the base metal, but the transverse tensile strength all exceeds the lowest limit of the base metal, it indicated that the weld joint can achieve equal strength matching. Furthermore, the double-sided synchronous TIG could reduce the work of overhead welding for X 7 Ni 9, the welding appearance and the welding quality could be improved...|$|R
40|$|Superduplex {{stainless}} steels have superior mechanical and corrosion properties compared to austenitic {{stainless steels}} such as the grade 300 series. This {{is a result of}} a microstructure consisting of roughly equal percentages of austenite (y) and ferrite (a) and negligible inclusion content. As a result, super duplex stainless steels are increasingly being used in the offshore oil and gas industries. It is also envisaged that they will find application in the emergent renewable energy sector in areas such as offshore wind, wave and tidal electricity / hydrogen generation. Corrosion fatigue (CF) conditions are expected in such applications. Of critical concern are weld joints where inherent sub critical surface/embedded flaws diminish crack initiation resistance enhancing the probability of subsequent crack propagation. The current research investigates the CF crack propagation performance of weld metals produced by two welding techniques. Since sub sea components are always cathodically protected, this condition was simulated in the CF tests. In addition, high positive potentials were simulated, as this condition is possible in the absence of cathodic protection. One weldment was completed using the expensive and relatively slow gas tungsten arc (GTA) welding method. The other weldment was achieved using the GTA method for the root pass and subsequently filled using the cheap and relatively quick shielded metal arc (SMA) welding method. The resultant crack propagation life was derived from the crack propagation tests by means of a numerical model. Fatigue life of the weld metals (assuming negligible residual stress influence) is similar to standard design curves for class D, carbon and carbon-manganese structural steel butt welds. Thresholds for the onset of crack growth in Zeron 100 base and weld metals are similar and were shown by means of the numerical model to correspond with the endurance limit specified in the standard design curve. Cathodic over protection is much more deleterious than high positive potentials above a critical stress level for Zeron 100 base and weld metals leading to an increase in crack propagation rates on average by a factor of 4. 3 over rates in air. The GTA root/SMA <b>fill</b> <b>weld</b> metal performs equally well as the GTA root/GTA <b>fill</b> <b>weld.</b> Therefore, a potential economic saving is evident. Finally, a new model for hydrogen assisted subcritical brittle crack propagation in ferrite is proposed...|$|R

By means of optical microscope (OM), the microstructure of the weld joint was investigated, which is welded by {{tungsten inert gas}} arc backing welding (GTAW) and manual arc <b>filling</b> <b>welding</b> (SMAW). The mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of the welded joint was also tested and studied. Results indicate that austenite and acicular ferrite distribute uniformly in the weld metal, which strengths the toughness and ductility of the joint. The austenite content in weld is higher than that in over-heated zone of S 31803. The SMAW joint structure is coarsening than that of GTAW and has more austenite content.

Martin Marietta Laboratories has developed an Al-Li alloy designated 2195 which is designated {{for use in the}} cryogenic tanks of the space shuttle. The Variable Polarity Plasma Arc (VPPA) welding process is currently being used to produce these welds [1]. VPPA welding utilizes high temperature ionized gas (plasma) to transfer heat to the workpiece. An inert gas, such as Helium, is used to shield the active welding zone to prevent contamination of the molten base metal with surrounding reactive atmospheric gases. [1] In the Space Shuttle application, two passes of the arc are used to complete a butt-type weld. The pressure of the plasma stream is increased during the first pass to force the arc entirely through the material, a practice commonly referred to as keyholing. Molten metal forms {{on either side of the}} arc and surface tension draws this liquid together as the arc passes. 2319 Al alloy filler material may also be fed into the weld zone during this pass. During the second pass, the plasma stream pressure is reduced such that only partial penetration of the base material is obtained. Al 2319 filler material is added during this pass to yield a uniform, fully <b>filled</b> <b>welded</b> joint. This additional pass also acts to alter the grain structure of the weld zone to yield a higher strength joint...|$|R
5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode <b>fills</b> the <b>weld</b> joint, up to twice as fast.|$|R
40|$|The {{intervertebral}} discs of the lumbar spine can {{be damaged}} {{as a result}} of trauma, disease or deformity. If an intervertebral disc becomes too compromised the current surgical solution is to fuse the vertebra at the affected spinal level. Spinal fusion presents its own complications which can limit its short and long term success. One of the key limiting factors is the loss of mobility at the affected level, this causes additional loading and accelerated degradation of the adjacent intervertebral discs. Therefore, the aim of this project was to develop an intervertebral disc implant which allowed natural motion at the affected level. The implant developed consists of a fluid <b>filled</b> <b>welded</b> bellows assembly. This arrangement is similar to a healthy intervertebral disc in which the fluid nucleus pulpous is contained by the annulus fibrosus. The proposed implant also incorporates overload and motion-restricting features to prevent the implant and spinal column being damaged. Artificial disc implants have been developed by other researchers. The implant developed in this project is unique as it does not generate any wear debris. This is significant as wear debris can cause a macrophage response and osteolysis, thus ultimately limiting the long term viability of implants which do produce wear debris. This thesis also details the development of BioModelling methodology for producing graphical reconstructions from medical scan data. These reconstructions can be used to produce plastic and metallic models for pre-operative planning purposes and implants for in-vivo use. While originally intended for the spinal implant work, it was ultimately used for other tasks. A case study illustrates its use in producing a maxilla implant. The final component of this project was to design and produce a femoral endoprosthesis for a patient with Osteogenesis Imperfecta.

40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has {{published}} a standard that specifies the criteria for preparation and packaging of plutonium metals and oxides for safe long-term storage (DOE-STD- 3013 - 96). This standard is followed for the packaging of materials resulting from the disassembly of nuclear weapons at Los Alamos National Laboratory under the Advanced Retirement and Integrated Extraction System (ARIES) project. Declassified plutonium metal or oxide material from the ARES project is packaged into doubly contained and welded type 304 L stainless steel containers that comply with the DOE standard. The 3013 - 96 standard describes requirements for maximum contamination limits on the outer surface of the sealed inner container. These limits are 500 dpm per 100 cm 2 for direct measurements and 20 dpm per 100 cm 2 for removable contamination. For containers <b>filled,</b> <b>welded,</b> and handled inside a highly contaminated glovebox line, these limits are difficult to obtain. Simple handling within the line is demonstrated to contaminate surfaces from 10, 000 to 10, 000, 000 dpm alpha per 100 cm 2. To routinely achieve contamination levels below the maximum contamination levels specified by the 3013 - 96 standard within a processing operation, a decontamination step must be included. In the ARIES line, this decontamination step is an electrolytic process that produces a controlled uniform etch of the container surfaces. Decontamination of the 3013 - 96 compliant ARIES inner container is well demonstrated. Within 30 to 50 minutes electrolysis time, tixed contamination is reduced to hundreds of dpm generally occurring only at electrode contact points and welds. Removable contamination is routinely brought to non-detectable levels. The total process time for the cycle (includes electrolysis, rinse, and dry stages) is {{on the order of}} 1. 5 to 2 hours per container. The ARIES inner container decontamination system highly automated and consists of a plumbing loop, electronic controls and process monitors, and a decontamination chamber or "fixture".

The results show a change in the measured hoop stress at the weld toe from tension to compression between the half- and fully-filled weld.

Through thickness neutron diffraction strain mappings at NRSF 2 for the four plates and associated strain-free d-zero specimens involved measurement along seven lines across the weld and at six to seven depths. The mountings of each plate for neutron diffraction measurements were such that the diffraction vector was parallel to each of the three primary orthogonal directions of the plate: two in-plane directions, longitudinal and transverse, and the direction normal to the plate (shown in left figure within Table 1). From the three orthogonal strains for each location, the residual stresses along the three plate directions were calculated. The principal axes of the strain and stress tensors, however, need not necessarily align with the plate coordinate system. To explore this, plate P- 5 was selected for examination of the possibility that the principal axes of strain are not along the sample coordinate system axes. If adequate data could be collected the goal would be to determine the strain tensor's orientation and magnitude of strain along each principle axis direction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Due {{to heavy}} demand in plastic products, plastic {{industries}} are emergent in a fastest rate. Plastic injection molding begins with mould making and in manufacturing of complex shapes; the optimum gate location {{is one of}} the most important criterions in mould design. Mould Flow analysis is a powerful simulation tool to optimize the gate location and to predict the Production time required at the lowest possible cost. Optimization of sequence occasion, keep away from scrap and manual interface plays a vital role in manufacturing of plastic parts to improve the productivity of the process and at the time it should not affect the quality of the final product. This paper describes the influence of gate location and size through a repeated number of analyses which is carried out by plastic flow advisor software to reduce fill time, scrap and automatic degating. The process parameters like <b>fill</b> time, shrinkage, <b>weld</b> lines, pressure drop, and air traps are analyzed by simulation in successive trials. Experimental verification has been done with new optimized gate location with designed mould in Injection molding machine. The results showed an improvement in fill time from 1. 58 sec to 1. 22 sec with increase in injection Pressure by 80 MPa. Shrinkage and air traps were reduced minimizing trouble shooting defeats...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Aim at {{the issue}} that the bending crack is easy to {{generate}} inside dissimilar welded joint of low alloy steel and stainless steel, a new process of submerged arc <b>welding</b> <b>filled</b> with Ni wire is put forward. The influence mechanism of filling quantity of Ni wire to the joint of microstructure evolutions and mechanical properties is mainly explored based on the contrast test of non-filling Ni wire and three different filling speeds of Ni wire. The experiment results indicate that, the filling process of Ni wire supplies austenite forming element, and alters heat allocation process of molten pool. The filling quantity of Ni wire is the quantitative parameter, {{it is used to}} control the transition width between low alloy steel and weld metal, also to adjust the peak temperature and holding time at elevated temperature of molten pool. When the value of the filling quantity of Ni wire is determined, the problem of bending crack in the fusion zone of low alloy steel can be solved, and also the overheat damage can be eliminated. At the same time, the grains of weld metal and heat affected zone are refined. And on this basis the plasticity, toughness and microhardness of welded joint can be guaranteed...|$|R
40|$|Sweden is {{planning}} to store nuclear spent fuel in long-term geological repositories. Copper canisters with a ductile iron insert will preserve the fuel {{for thousands of years}} at a depth of about 500 m in Swedish bedrock. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Euratom safeguards inspectorates have to maintain the continuity of knowledge (CoK) during transport and deposition of canisters from the encapsulation plant to the final repository. The aim of this paper is then oriented to provide such CoK for canisters by an identification and authentication based on ultrasound. This paper describes an authentication method oriented to prevent falsification of copper canisters. According to the ultrasonic investigation of the friction stir welding process of the copper lid onto the cylindrical tube, the ultrasonic response of the remaining gap partially <b>filled</b> during the <b>welding</b> is used as a unique pattern for authentication. The analysis of various measurements made on angular sections of copper lids friction stir welded onto the tube revealed the feasibility of acquisition of a valuable signal from the reflection of the internal gap. Following the observations on this data set, a possible technical design is detailed, where the identification and authentication methods can be combined with immersion probes. JRC. G.

40|$|Summary. — Southern Peru can {{be divided}} into 3 {{longitudinal}} zones : the coast range, high plains (about 3 000 ft) known as the Pampas, the main Sierra, gently sloping towards the aggradational Altiplano of lake Titicaca. Occasionally, the Pampas are separated from the Sierra by cristalline hills and intermediate brnins, the main one being the Arequipa trough, <b>filled</b> with a <b>welded</b> tuff, the sillar. The main chronological stages appear to be : — main uplift raising the late miocène Puna surface of erosion, cut in the Sierra, over the Pampas and Arequipa basin; an active volcanic period (chachani, then barroso) may have taken place after the uplift. The deposit of the sillar welded tuff is likely to have taken place during the chachani stage, which is about 3 million years old; — erosion in the Arequipa trough and correlative deposition of the glacis type alluvium of the Pampas; — joint uplift of all parts of the region (Coast range, Pampas, Arequipa basin, Sierra) in Pleistocene times, through a coastal warping or uplifting accounting for an uplift of about 3 000 ft.

40|$|Laser-deposit welding, {{by using}} Nd-YAG, is a mould {{repairing}} process, {{which has the}} advantages relatively to the traditional methods of achieving a less change of the metal composition around the repaired zone and permitting a very accurate deposition of a small volume of the filler material in the area chosen at the work-piece surface. This paper presents a fatigue study in specimens of two base materials used in mould production (AISI H 13 and P 20). Filler material as well as welding parameters were analysed {{in order to obtain}} better fatigue strength. The tests were carried out under constant amplitude loading, with two stress ratios R =  0 and R =  0. 4. Welded specimens were prepared with V notches and <b>filled</b> with laser <b>welding</b> deposits. The fatigue results are presented in the form of S-N curves obtained in welded and non-welded conditions. Complementary measurements of hardness profiles and SEM analysis were carried out to understanding the fatigue behaviour and failure sites. The laser-deposit material was the weaker region in both steels, due to a high level of tensile residual stresses and also to some planar defects that are potential failure sites. Fatigue crack initiation is therefore reduced and the fatigue propagation life is enhanced. A significant mean stress effect in the base material was also observed in both mould steels. [URL]...|$|R
