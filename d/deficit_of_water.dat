40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from American Society of Civil Engineers via the DOI in this record. Reliability, resilience and vulnerability are {{the most commonly used}} performance criteria for water supply planning and management. However, there is lack of understanding of the relationships among these criteria. This paper aims to reveal the relationships among them by using an emerging many-objective visual analytics. To measure different aspects of water supply systems in terms of reliability, resilience and vulnerability, a suite of five metrics are considered: water supply reliability, mean and maximum deficits of water supply as well as mean and maximum durations of water shortage. Results obtained in this study reveals that both conflicting and synergetic relationships exist between reliability and resilience (mean <b>deficit</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> supply), and between vulnerability (mean duration of water shortage) and resilience (mean <b>deficit</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> supply) in different regions of the objective space. A more complete picture of the relationships among reliability, resilience and vulnerability than reported in the prior literature is provided in this paper thanks to the use of many-objective analysis.

Periodic discharges (blow down) will occur typically from a single sedimentation control basin with an NPDES discharge.

The influence of human intervention through water management is shown to be intrinsic to the definition of drought in the universal sense and can only be eliminated in the case of purely meteorological drought. The state of `drought' is shown to be predicated on the existence of climatological norms for a multitude of process specific terms. In general these norms are either difficult to obtain or even non-existent in the non-stationary context of climate change.
