25|$|The {{similar but}} {{essentially}} unrelated arm-reliquary {{was a popular}} form during the medieval period when the hand was most used. Typically these are in precious metal, showing the hand {{and most of the}} forearm, pointing up erect from a <b>flat</b> <b>base</b> where the arm stopped. They contained relics, usually from that part of the body of the saint, and it was the saint's hand that was represented.|$|E
25|$|The {{eastern side}} of the fell forms the head of Swindale proper, the upper valley being known as Mosedale. Swindale is a classic U-shaped valley, its profile almost a square section, with a <b>flat</b> <b>base</b> and sheer walls. Selside Pike's eastern slopes fall gently to about the 2,000ft contour and then plunge over a wall of crag to the valley floor. Geordie Greathead Crag is the {{dominant}} feature and below this is the dry tarnbed of Dodd Bottom. Hobgrumble Gill falls down this face in a deep gully, separating Selside Pike from the north east ridge of High Howes. Above the crags the gill runs in a small hanging valley.|$|E

25|$|Amphorae, or amphoras, {{were used}} during Roman times to {{transport}} food on {{long and short}} distances. The content was generally liquid, olive oil or wine in most cases, but also , the popular fish sauce, and fruit sauce. As a container, an amphora {{was supposed to be}} strong, not too heavy, shaped in a way suitable for easy storage in the ship, and, at the same time, convenient for handling once arrived to its final destination. Usually, amphorae are two-handled terracotta containers with a globular/cylindrical body, a rim of various shapes, and a spiked or, less commonly, <b>flat</b> <b>base.</b> The spike was suited for a stable storage arrangement in the ship and it worked as a third handle in the process of emptying the container.|$|E
25|$|The Great Mosque of Kairouan (in Tunisia) is {{considered}} the ancestor of all the mosques in the western Islamic world. Its original marble columns and sculptures were of Roman workmanship brought in from Carthage and other elements resemble Roman form. It {{is one of the}} best preserved and most significant examples of early great mosques, founded in 670 AD and dating in its present form largely from the Aghlabid period (9th century). The Great Mosque of Kairouan is constituted of a massive square minaret, a large courtyard surrounded by porticos and a huge hypostyle prayer hall covered on its axis by two cupolas. The Great Mosque of Samarra in Iraq, completed in 847 AD, combined the hypostyle architecture of rows of columns supporting a <b>flat</b> <b>base</b> above which a huge spiraling minaret was constructed.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} either white or pale yellow in their initial stages and {{gradually}} {{change to a}} speckled purple {{within a few days}} of fertilisation. They have <b>flat</b> <b>base</b> and apex with a moderately thick shell, consisting of 14 to 18 rib-like striations. The laid eggs, however, remain dormant during the hot Australian summers. The larvae begin to develop within the eggs only if the autumn showers wet the eggs, the temperature falls, or the number of daylight hours decreases. The developed larva within the egg does not emerge until the prolonged autumn showers wet the eggs. Once the larva wants to emerge from the egg, it partially cuts open a part of the shell and pushes its way out. In most cases the larva eats the shell to immediately nourish its weak body. It then finds its way to young grass areas to further nourish itself.|$|E

25|$|Various {{forms of}} the rose cut have been in use since the mid-16th century. Like the step cuts, they were derived from older types of cuts. The basic rose cut has a <b>flat</b> <b>base</b> - that is, it lacks a {{pavilion}} - and has a crown composed of triangular facets (usually 12 or 24) rising to form a point (there is no table facet) in an arrangement with sixfold rotational symmetry. The so-called double rose cut is a variation that adds six kite facets at {{the margin of the}} base. The classic rose cut is circular in outline; non-circular variations on the rose cut include the briolette (oval), Antwerp rose (hexagonal), and double Dutch rose (resembling two rose cuts united back-to-back). Rose-cut diamonds are seldom seen nowadays, except in antique jewelry. Like the older style brilliants and step cuts, there is a growing demand for the purpose of repairing or reproducing antique pieces.|$|E

The horns of the western hartebeest are thick and appear U-shaped from the front and Z-shaped from the sides, growing backward {{at first and then}} forward, ending with a sharp backward turn. The horns of the red and the Lelwel hartebeest {{are similar to those of}} the western hartebeest, but appear V-shaped when viewed from the front. The Lichtenstein's hartebeest has thick parallel ringed horns, with a <b>flat</b> <b>base.</b> Its horns are shorter than those of other subspecies, curving upward then sharply forward, followed by an inward turn at an angle of about 45° and a final backward turn. The horns of Swayne's hartebeest are thin and shaped like parentheses, curving upward and then backward. The horns of the Tora hartebeest are particularly thin and spread out sideways, diverging more than in any other subspecies.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of the graves' east–west alignment has prompted suggestions that the cemetery reflected Christian tradition, although the evidence overall is contradictory about whether the occupants were Christians. The individual graves were fairly uniform in size, usually measuring [...] long, [...] wide and in their original form about [...] deep. They had a rectangular plan with rounded corners and a <b>flat</b> <b>base.</b> The bodies were not interred in coffins; the graves' occupants were buried in their clothes, accompanied by various items that they owned or were given as tokens by mourners. Although none of the bodies have survived it is thought from their size {{that most of the}} graves were intended for women, laid out fully extended. A substantial number are too small for an adult of normal height to have been laid out in such a way and, judging from analogous Saxon graves found elsewhere in England, it is thought that these might have contained crouched burials. The two different methods of burial – crouched versus fully extended – may therefore indicate some difference in ethnic affiliations or political or religious identities.|$|E

60|$|Lord Roberts A {{very nearly}} {{terminated}} all my investigations. My idea both {{in this and}} its more successful and famous younger brother, Lord Roberts B, was to utilise {{the idea of a}} contractile balloon with a rigid <b>flat</b> <b>base,</b> a balloon shaped rather like an inverted boat that should almost support the apparatus, but not quite. The gas-bag was of the chambered sort used for these long forms, and not with an internal balloonette. The trouble was to make the thing contractile. This I sought to do by fixing a long, fine-meshed silk net over it that was fastened to be rolled up on two longitudinal rods. Practically I contracted my sausage gas-bag by netting it down. The ends were too complex for me to describe here, but I thought them out elaborately and they were very carefully planned. Lord Roberts A was furnished with a single big screw forward, and there was a rudder aft. The engine {{was the first one to}} be, so to speak, right in the plane of the gas-bag. I lay immediately under the balloon on a sort of glider framework, far away from either engine or rudder, controlling them by wire-pulls constructed on the principle of the well-known Bowden brake of the cyclist.|$|E
