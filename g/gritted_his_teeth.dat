60|$|But Captain Davenport {{ignored his}} figures with so contemptuous a silence {{as to make}} Mr. Konig <b>grit</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> and curse savagely under his breath.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{found it}} first and I'm {{going to keep}} it!" [...] snapped Johnny Chuck, and with every hair on end and <b>gritting</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> he walked {{straight}} towards Mr. Blacksnake.|$|R
50|$|In a 2004 {{column for}} The Sporting News, pitcher Todd Jones wrote that Benes {{had a habit}} of <b>gritting</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> when {{preparing}} to throw a slider, a tell that some hitters exploited.|$|R
60|$|Akoon <b>gritted</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> The {{young men}} took El-Soo by the arms. She did not resist, and was led, {{her face a}} sullen flame, to Porportuk.|$|E
60|$|Along {{the beach}} {{they saw a}} man walking. He moved casually, as if out for a morning stroll. Captain Warfield <b>gritted</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> It was Narii Herring.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see." [...] The {{former teacher}} of Oak Hall <b>gritted</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> [...] "Oh, how I wish I could do {{something}} to punish Porter and those others!" ...|$|E
60|$|Billy {{shifted the}} light until it {{illuminated}} the doorway, and then threw the stick {{as he would}} pitch a baseball. They were now in total darkness, and {{they could hear the}} intruder <b>gritting</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> in rage.|$|R
50|$|The {{magazine}} featured fully painted covers by such {{artists as}} Ken Barr, Earl Norem, and Joe Jusko. Norem's {{work on the}} series includes a darkly-lit close-up of the Hulk's face, <b>gritting</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> with <b>his</b> knuckles raised, done for The Hulk! #17 (Oct. 1979).|$|R
25|$|The logo itself, {{featuring}} their mascot, Sarge, <b>gritting</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> is also army olive green, a mix {{of yellow}} and beige, white, fleshish pinky-orange, black, and red.

6000|$|Mr. Pike paced up {{and down}} the narrow house and <b>gritted</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> Then he paused. He leaned his arms on the bridge-rail, rested his head on his arms for a full minute, then groaned: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Can't tell yet--pretty gusty {{and full}} of holes," [...] was the answer, and Dick <b>gritted</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> tightly and took a firmer hold of the {{steering}} wheel. Then the Dartaway came around with a rush.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hang them Rover boys anyway!" [...] muttered old Ricks, as he <b>gritted</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> [...] "I'll be {{glad when}} they go off to college ag'in. Wish they would stay away!" [...] And he went about his work.|$|E
60|$|That evening Jasper Van Blott {{came out}} of hiding and {{attempted}} {{to take his place}} at the cabin table.

60|$|Goaded to rage by my bitter words, he <b>grit</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> and {{gathered}} what rags of strength were left {{him for a}} final effort, And before I {{knew what he was}} about, he had dropped on to his left knee, and with his body thrown forward and supported within a foot of the ground by his left arm, he came, like a snake, under my guard with his point directed upwards.|$|R
60|$|George Eastman muttered {{something}} inaudible {{as the door}} closed behind her. He was a short, thickset man, not in the least like Lawrence, who was ten years his junior. Two years previously he had made a furtive attempt to pay court to Bessy Houghton for the sake of her wealth, and her decided repulse of his advances was a remembrance that made him <b>grit</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> yet. He had hated her bitterly ever since.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's hell, ain't it, sir?" [...] was his greeting. [...] "And how am I goin' to get {{any sleep}} with that baboon {{chattering}} away there. He never lets up--keeps his chin-music goin' right along when he's asleep, only worse. The way he <b>grits</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> is something awful. Now I leave it to you, sir, is it right to put a crazy like that in with a sick man? And I am a sick man." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{only answer}} was a snore louder than before. Then Unc' Billy quite lost his temper. Some {{one who had}} no {{business}} there was in his house! He didn't know who it was, and he didn't care. They {{were going to come}} out or he would know why not. Unc' Billy <b>gritted</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> and in he went.|$|E
60|$|Wayne hurried up to {{the plate}} and took his position. He had always been a timely hitter, and he <b>gritted</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> in his resolve to settle this game. Mackay whirled his long arm, wheeled, took his long stride, and pitched a slow, tantalizing ball that seemed never to get anywhere. But Wayne waited, timed it perfectly, and met it squarely.|$|E
60|$|The hands, {{called in}} from the fields at that unwonted hour, were split into detachments. Some were sent into the woods to cut timber for house- beams, others to cutting cane-grass for thatching, and forty of them lifted a whale-boat above their heads and carried {{it down to the}} sea. Sheldon had <b>gritted</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> pulled his {{collapsing}} soul together, and taken Berande plantation into his fist once more.|$|E
5000|$|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) - The Hawaiian song [...] "Mele Kalikimaka", sung by Crosby and the Andrews Sisters {{is used to}} {{illustrate}} a dream sequence. A further nod to the Crosby influence on Christmas comes at Griswold's darkest hour when the family guests pack to leave the disaster stricken house. Chevy Chase bars their way, <b>grits</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> and says, [...] "Nobody leaves. This {{is going to be}} the happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap danced with Danny Kaye." ...|$|R
60|$|The mutineers are not starving. To-day {{they have}} been fishing for albatrosses. A few minutes after they caught the first one its carcase was flung overboard. Mr. Pike studied it through his sea-glasses, and I heard him <b>grit</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> when he made certain {{that it was not}} the mere {{feathers}} and skin but the entire carcass. They had taken only its wing- bones to make into pipe-stems. The inference was obvious: starving men would not throw meat away in such fashion.|$|R
5|$|The {{aggressive}} {{style of}} Sobers and South-Australia captain Les Favell heavily influenced Chappell during his formative years in senior cricket. In 1962–63, Chappell made his initial first-class century against a New South Wales {{team led by}} Australian captain Richie Benaud, who was bemused by the young batsman's habit of <b>gritting</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> as he faced up; to Benaud, {{it looked as if}} he was grinning. Chappell spent the northern summer of 1963 as a professional in England's Lancashire League with Ramsbottom and played a single first-class match for Lancashire against Cambridge University.|$|R
