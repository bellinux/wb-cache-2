40|$|Regulation 1896 / 2006 {{does not}} provide for {{effective}} debtor protection in cases when a European Order for Payment was not properly served on the debtor. As {{a result of the}} unilateral nature of the procedure for issuing the order, the order will be <b>declared</b> <b>enforceable</b> if the defendant does not challenge it within a period of 30 days. However, the service of the payment order shall safeguard the right to a defense. When the defendant has never been informed about the ongoing procedure, {{he should be able to}} easily contest the Order for Payment even after it has been <b>declared</b> <b>enforceable.</b> Yet, the text of the Regulation {{does not provide}} for a remedy in this situation. In a reference for a preliminary ruling, the Local Court Berlin-Wedding asked the European Court of Justice which remedy should apply. The referring court suggested an application by analogy of the review proceedings provided for in Article 20 of Regulation 1896 / 2006 in order to ensure an effective right to a defense. Regrettably, the CJEU did not endorse this solution. It declared national procedural law applicable in accordance with Article 26 of the Regulation. As a consequence, parties are sent to the fragmented remedies of national procedural laws. As the efficiency and uniform application of Regulation 1896 / 2006 is no longer guaranteed, the European lawmaker is called to remedy the insufficient situation. This article addresses the final decision of the Local Court which implemented the CJEU’s judgment...|$|E

50|$|In a {{decision}} dated April 28, 2009, the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam <b>declared</b> the awards <b>enforceable.</b> Subsequently, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands issued a final ruling in 2010 ordering Rosneft to pay $389.3 million in claims. As {{a result of}} the Dutch court decision, in 2010 Rosneft paid Yukos the value of the awards. However, it did not pay the $160 million post-award interest that had accrued since 2006. When Rosneft refused to make the requested payments, Yukos Capital asked the courts in Britain, Ireland and the state of New York to oblige it. That same year, a UK court froze £425 million ($640 million) held in UK bank accounts by Rosneft to enforce the claim. This {{was the first time that}} Rosneft was materially affected by its acquisition of Yukos's assets.|$|R
5000|$|What she {{actually}} received however was 500,000 Greek drachmae, {{which had a}} market exchange value of approximately $25 {{at the time of}} the execution of the contract on account of massive hyperinflation. After Demotsis refused to repay the loan once the war was over, Batsakis sued and Demotsis asserted as her defense that the contract was unenforceable due to a lack of consideration (the element of exchange generally necessary to make a contract valid in common law systems) and that Batsakis's delivery of 500,000 drachmae, with a putative value of $25, could not be adequate consideration for her promise of $2,000, making the contract unenforceable. The trial court <b>declared</b> the contract <b>enforceable</b> and awarded Batsakis $750 plus interest and Batsakis appealed the judgment at which time the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision but modified the damages to $2,000 [...] "with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum from April 2, 1942 and ordered that such judgment will bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum until paid on $2,000.00 thereof and on the balance interest at the rate of 6% per annum." [...] The Court of Appeals reasoned that the consideration given by Demotsis for Batsakis's promise of 500,000 drachmae could not be considered inadequate under state law as she had received [...] "exactly what she contracted for." [...] The appellate court found the consideration legally sufficient and went on to state that the adequacy or inadequacy of the consideration did not bear on the enforceability, since mere inadequacy of consideration will not void a contract. The appellate court noted that, in common law systems including the American system, courts generally review the legal sufficiency of the consideration in a contract but have historically refused ordinarily to inquire into the adequacy of the consideration, whether the transaction was generally a fair or equivalent exchange.|$|R
