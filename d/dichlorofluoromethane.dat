40|$|AbstractIn the past, we {{described}} a dry {{process for the}} fabrication of CdTe/CdS thin film solar cells. In this process, most of the layers composing the cell, namely ITO, ZnO, CdS and back contact are deposited by sputtering and CdTe is deposited by close-spaced sublimation. The treatment of CdTe is done at 400 °C, for 10 - 20 minutes, without CdCl 2, by using a Freon gas, <b>dichlorofluoromethane,</b> as a Cl supplier. Back contact is made by depositing onto a not-etched CdTe film surface a buffer layer of As 2 Te 3, followed by {{a thin layer of}} Cu and Mo. Recently, we modified the Cl-treatment and we improved the quality of the back contact. Since <b>dichlorofluoromethane</b> is an ozone depleting agent and its use is now forbidden, we replaced it with a gas, like Ar, containing 4 %HCl and mixing it with a Fluorine-containing gas, such as CHF 3. Both these gases are not depleting agents and they aren’t forbidden. By adjusting the relative amounts of the chemical species into this mixture, we got results which are very similar to those obtained with <b>dichlorofluoromethane.</b> Concerning the back contact, we discovered that, by using as a buffer layer As 2 Te 3, or Bi 2 Te 3 and by making an annealing in air at 200 °C for 15 - 30 minutes, a stable and ohmic contact, without any rollover in the solar cell I-V characteristic, is obtained...|$|E
40|$|The high density, low {{toxicity}} characteristics of refrigerant- 12 (<b>dichlorofluoromethane)</b> {{make it an}} ideal gas for wind tunnel testing. Present limitations on R- 12 emissions, set to slow the rate of ozone deterioration, pose a difficult problem in recovery and handling of large quantities of R- 12. This preliminary design is a possible {{solution to the problem}} of R- 12 handling in wind tunnel testing. The design incorporates cold temperature condensation with secondary purification of the R- 12 /air mixture by adsorption.

(Saint Louis, MO). CT (99.9 %, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), CF (99.7 %, Sigma-Aldrich), DCM (99.9 %, AlliedSignal, Morristown, NJ), CFC- 11 (99 %, Sigma-Aldrich), and carbon disulfide (CS 2, 100 %, J.T. Baker, Center Valley, PA) were obtained as neat liquids. CM (99.9 %, Praxair, Danbury, CT), HCFC- 21 (<b>dichlorofluoromethane,</b> 99 %, SynQuest Labs, Alachua, FL), HCFC- 31 (chlorofluoromethane, 99 %, SynQuest Labs), and methane (99.99 %, Matheson, Longmont, CO) were obtained as neat gases.

40|$|LFG, cometabolism, {{inhibition}} competitive inhibition, methanogenic bacteria, methanotrophic bacteria The biodegradation of volatile fully chlorofluonnated hydro-carbons (CFCs), partly chlorofluorinated hydrocarbons (H-CFCs) and {{vinyl chloride}} (VC) were investigated in compost and marl in laboratory studies. Trichlorofluoromethane (R 11), dichlorodifluoromethane (R 12), 1, 1, 2 -trichlorotriflu-oroethane (R 113), difluoromethane (R 32) and VC were bio-degradable in compost under anaerobic conditions, probably by methanogenic bacteria. The anaerobic decomposition products of R 11 were <b>dichlorofluoromethane</b> (R 21) and chlo-rofluoromethane (R 31). The degradation product of R 12 was chlorodifluoromethane (R 22). R 11 and its degradation prod-ucts have the inhibiting {{effects of the}} R 12 degradation under anaerobic conditions. The partly halogenated hydrocarbon R 22 and VC were degraded preferentially under aerobic con-ditions in marl, probably by methanotrophic bacteria.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{concern over the}} {{detrimental}} health effects to firefighters produced by exposure to combustion byproducts of burning materials. To assess the types and levels of exposure encountered by firefighters during their routine occupational duties, members of the Buffalo Fire Department were monitored during firefighting activities with personal, portable, ambient environmental sampling devices. The results indicate that firefighters are frequently exposed to significant concentrations of hazardous materials including carbon monoxide, benzene, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, aldehydes, hydrogen chloride, <b>dichlorofluoromethane,</b> and particulates. Furthermore, in many cases of the worst exposure to these materials respiratory protective equipment was not used owing to the visual impression of low smoke intensity, and thus these levels represent actual direct exposure of the firefighters. Many of these materials have been implicated {{in the production of}} cardiovascular, respiratory, or neoplastic diseases, which may provide an explanation for the alleged increased risk for these illnesses among firefighters...|$|E
40|$|This report {{focuses on}} methane {{oxidising}} bacteria (methanotrophs). The key function of methanotrophs as methane consumers and degraders of halogenated hydrocarbons {{bring them in}} the perspective of being useful indicators of environmental perturbations. Effects of climate on diversity and temperature adaptation {{as well as the}} capacity of different methanotrophs to degrade two atmospheric pollutants (chlorofluoromethanes) was investigated. None of the methanotrophs were found to be adapted for growth at permanently low temperatures although type I methanotrophs grew better at lower temperatures than the type II methanotrophs. Some of the methanotrophs were able to degrade <b>dichlorofluoromethane</b> while chlorodifluoromethane degradation was not demonstrated. No correlation was found between the degradation capacity and the origin of the isolates (landfill or wetland soil), or characteristics of their methane monooxygenase enzymes. The project did not identify a simple correlation between climatic variation or environmental stress and the variation in composition of the methanotroph community. More knowledge about temperature dependent interactions between type I and type II methanotrophs is needed before the composition of methanotrophs can be implemented as an indicator revealing ecological consequences of e. g. changes in climate...|$|E
40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae was {{incubated}} in aerosol cans containing YM {{broth and}} <b>dichlorofluoromethane</b> (f- 21). The presence {{and number of}} viable cells were determined by inoculating (1 % vol/vol) YM broth and by the plate count procedure (YM agar). Inactivation of the yeast was greater or more rapid when: (i) the thermodynamic activity (saturation value) of f- 21 became greater through increasing the concentration of chemical from 0. 5 to 1. 5 % (wt/wt) in a given volume (20, 40, or 80 ml) of broth, or by holding the concentration of chemical constant but increasing the volume of broth in the test vessel, (ii) the temperature of treatment was increased (7, 22, 37, and 47 C), (iii) samples with 1. 5 % (wt/wt) f- 21 were agitated, (iv) young (8 h) rather than old (36 h or 10 days) cells were treated, and (v) cells were grown in YM broth without, rather than with, glucose. Adjusting the pH (6. 3 to 4. 0) of broth before treatment, pretreating the substrate with f- 21, or distilling the chemical before use {{had no effect on}} viability of cells when treated with f- 21. Yeast cells inactivated by f- 21, chlorine, or heat were more resistant to disruption by sonic treatment than were viable cells...|$|E
40|$|On 9 April 2001, while {{approaching}} the West Coast of the North American continent, flight 20 of the NASA TRACE P campaign penetrated deeply into a stratospheric intrusion. From measurements aboard that flight we derive vertical profiles of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and other short-lived trace {{gases in the}} lower stratosphere using <b>Dichlorofluoromethane,</b> CF 2 Cl 2, as the altitude scale. All profiles show an exponential decrease, which permits the description of their vertical distribution by a single parameter, the scale height. These scale heights are shown {{to be related to}} the respective lifetimes in a unique fashion. Using the approximation of a 1 -D diffusive model with a constant eddy diffusion coefficient, K, and assuming constant lifetimes, we establish an analytical solution for this relation. By fitting this theoretical expression to the experimental data we can estimate K and thus obtain an approximate age spectrum of the form given by Hall and Plumb (1994). A much better fit to the experimental scale heights is obtained, when we allow the lifetimes to be height-dependent and calculate the theoretical scale heights numerically from a 1 -D model. An optimization also suggests a constant K, but with a value of 0. 46 m(2) /s, larger than those obtained from the fit of the analytical solution. The obtained age spectra should be valid for transit times not longer than 300 days...|$|E
30|$|Most {{previous}} research on bioremediation of CT, CF and CFC- 11 at elevated concentrations focused on individual compounds. For example, {{in the presence of}} vitamin B 12, a fermentative culture grown on dichloromethane (DCM) transformed up to 270  mg/L CF (Becker and Freedman [1994]) and a sulfate reducing enrichment culture developed from anaerobic digester sludge transformed up to 350  mg/L CT (Freedman et al. [1995]). The highest concentration of CFC- 11 evaluated previously was 2.2  mg/L and resulted in accumulation of <b>dichlorofluoromethane</b> (HCFC- 21), which is not an acceptable endpoint (Krone and Thauer [1992]). Although bioaugmentation continues to mature as an option for treatment of chlorinated ethenes (ESTCP 2005), there has been less progress with halogenated methanes. SDC- 9 ™ biodegrades CT and CF, but it has been evaluated at relatively low concentrations, i.e., 2.3  mg/L CT and 3.2  mg/L CF (ESTCP 2005). Recently, Dehalobacter spp. have been described that reductively dechlorinate up to approximately 60  mg/L of CF to DCM via organohalide respiration (Grostern et al. [2010]; Lee et al. [2012]). DCM is not an acceptable endpoint, but microbes that use DCM as a sole carbon and energy source have been reported (Freedman and Gossett [1991]; Justicia-Leon et al. [2012]; Mägli et al. [1998]); Lee et al. ([2012]) described a mixture of Dehalobacter spp. that reduced 50  mg/L of CF to DCM, which was subsequently fermented to acetate, CO 2, and H 2; evaluation of higher CF concentrations was not reported.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Firefighters are {{frequently}} exposed to significant concentrations of hazardous materials including heavy metals, aldehydes, hydrogen chloride, <b>dichlorofluoromethane</b> and some particulates. Many {{of these materials}} have been implicated in the triggering of several diseases. The aim {{of the present study}} is to investigate the effect of fire smoke exposure on serum heavy metals and possible affection on iron functions compounds (total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation percent, ferritin, unsaturated iron-binding capacity blood hemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin,). Subjects and methods Two groups of male firefighter volunteers were included; the first included 28 firefighters from Jeddah city, while the second included 21 firefighters from Yanbu city with an overall age rang of 20 – 48 years. An additional group of 23 male non-firefighters volunteered from both cities as normal control subjects. Blood samples were collected from all volunteer subjects and investigated for relevant parameters. Results The results obtained showed that there were no statistically significant changes in the levels of serum heavy metals in firefighters as compared to normal control subjects. Blood carboxyhemoglobin and serum ferritin were statistically increased in Jeddah firefighters, (p Conclusion Such results might point to the need for more health protective and prophylactic measures to avoid such hazardous health effects (elevated Blood carboxyhemoglobin and serum ferritin and decreased serum TIBC and UIBC) that might endanger firefighters working under dangerous conditions. Firefighters must be under regular medical follow-up through standard timetabled medical laboratory investigations to allow for early detection of any serum biochemical or blood hematological changes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) are {{a group of}} major indoor air pollutants that {{has been associated with}} many health problems. The influence of the operation of mechanical ventilation systems on the accumulation of the levels of VOCs is an important subject as people spend a significant amount of time indoors. Mechanically ventilated buildings are also environments that occupants are least able to control. This study aimed at collecting information about the levels of 43 individual VOCs using US-EPA Method TO- 14 and the level of total volatile {{organic compounds}} (TVOC) using real time monitoring by a Photo-acoustic Spectroscopy Infrared (PAS-IR) gas analyzer. The PAS-IR method was further verified with US-EPA Method TO- 12 by means of regression analysis and a satisfactory result was obtained. The site measurements were conducted in both the indoor and adjacent outdoor environments of a range of various mechanically ventilated premises. This study covered both the office sector and the non-office sector which include customer service centers, institutional buildings, hospitals, etc. Samples and measurements were taken when the mechanical ventilation was turned on as well as when it was turned off. The 43 individual VOCs were distinguished and quantified by means of Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS). The results were further analyzed by categorizing them into three classes, namely, aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons and organohalogen. The weight % of chlorinated hydrocarbons (48 %) and the weight % of aromatic hydrocarbons (38 %) only differed by about 10 % in the office sector. Organohalogen (14 %) was contributed to the smallest fraction of the total on all the premises in the office sector on weight basis. A completely different distribution pattern was found in the non-office sector. The most abundant class of VOCs in terms of weight was aromatic hydrocarbons (80 %). The second abundant class of VOCs was chlorinated hydrocarbons (14 %) and was much less than the level of aromatic hydrocarbons in terms of weight. Organohalogen (6 %) contributed to the smallest fraction of the total on all the premises in the non-office sector on weight basis. Hundreds of VOCs have been identified in indoor air and more than 350 VOCs have been recorded at concentrations higher than lppb. In this study, statistical analysis was also carried out to investigate the correlation among 43 individual VOCs which were documented in the well-established US-EPA Method TO- 14. This method has been adopted by many researchers worldwide. In this study, these 43 VOCs were chosen for comparison purpose. Among the 43 targeted VOCs in this study, 15 VOCs had good correlation with other VOCs in the office sector. For these 15 VOCs, 7 VOCs were aromatic hydrocarbons and they were benzene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, p-xylene, o-xylene, 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene. The other 7 were chlorinated hydrocarbons and they were <b>dichlorofluoromethane</b> (12), methyl chloride, trichlorofluoromethane (11), dichloromethane, chloroform, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. The remaining VOC was an organohalogen and it was p-dichlorobenzene. While in the non-office sector, 16 VOCs had good correlation with other VOCs. Among these 16 VOCs, 9 VOCs were aromatic hydrocarbons and they were benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, p-xylene, styrene, o-xylene, 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene, p-ethyltoluene. The other 5 were chlorinated hydrocarbons and they were dichloromethane, chloroform, 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. The remaining 2 VOCs were organohalogen and they were p-dichlorobenzene and 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene. Source apportionment analysis was also conducted based on a material balance equation. This analysis has identified the relative contributions to VOC indoor accumulation from building material related sources, occupant related sources, ventilation ductwork related and outdoor sources. This study revealed that TVOC level in the evening after the mechanical ventilation system was turned off could be generally higher than the day time level by 7 to 35 %. In general, the emission rate of the contaminant from ventilation ductwork ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 99 μg/s. The emission rate of the contaminant from building material ranged from 0 to 0. 46 μg/m 2 s. The contaminant emission rate from each occupant ranged from 1. 37 to 17. 52 μg/s per person. The ratio of the TVOC contribution from building material related sources to occupant related sources ranged from 1. 7 : 1 to 56 : 1. In this study, it was estimated that the building material related TVOC sources and the occupant related TVOC sources each contributed 0 to 55 % by weight (mean = 21 %) and 0 to 73 % by weight (mean = 20 %) respectively to the total indoor TVOC sources. The remaining part came from the outdoor sources which ranged from 14 - ~ 100 % by weight (mean = 60 %). The TVOC level contributed by ventilation duct related sources of less than 1 % was found to be negligible...|$|E
