40|$|From winter 1997 {{to summer}} 1998, an {{epizootic}} of salmonellosis affected {{several species of}} songbirds over a large area of the eastern North American continent. This article describes {{the details of this}} epizootic in the Canadian Atlantic provinces, based on laboratory examination of dead affected birds and on suspected but unconfirmed cases of salmonellosis reported by members of the public. The common redpoll (Carduelis flammea) was the species most often affected, followed by pine siskins (C. pinus), purple finches (Carpodacus purpureus), <b>evening</b> <b>grosbeaks</b> (Coccothraustes vespertinus), and American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis). A poor body condition and necrotizing and fibrinopurulent esophagitis and ingluvitis were the most common gross lesions in these birds. Thirty-four of 35 isolates of Salmonella recovered from these birds were identified as phage type 40. Despite the magnitude of this and previous epizootics of salmonellosis among North American songbirds, the sources of these epizootics and the precise influence of environmental factors on their occurrence remain poorly understood.

50|$|The {{adult male}} in {{breeding}} plumage has a black head, wings, back and tail, {{and a bright}} rose-red patch on its breast; the wings have two white patches and rose-red linings. Its underside and rump are white. Males in nonbreeding plumage have largely white underparts, supercilium and cheeks. The upperside feathers have brown fringes, most wing feathers white ones, giving a scaly appearance. The bases of the primary remiges are also white. The coloration renders the adult male rose-breasted <b>grosbeak</b> (<b>even</b> while wintering) unmistakable if seen well.|$|R
50|$|This bird is the least-known of the golden-winged <b>grosbeaks.</b> <b>Even</b> {{before the}} start of the Somali Civil War in the late 1980s, little ornithological {{fieldwork}} was being done in this country. While no estimate of population size exists, it seems fairly certain that since the 1930s the birds have declined in numbers, perhaps due to habitat loss and more recently, declining rainfall in the region.

Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME) caused by E. chaffeensis occurs across a broad area of the eastern and south-central United States. HME is transmitted by lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum). Human granulocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HGE) caused by a currently unnamed organism closely related to or perhaps identical with E. equi or E. phagocytophila has been diagnosed mainly in the northeastern, upper midwestern, and western United States. HGE is transmitted by black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis and I. pacificus). A combined total of over 1, 200 cases of HME and HGE were diagnosed in people between 1986 and 1997. The third zoonotic ehrlichiosis, caused by E. ewingii, was diagnosed in four people from Missouri in 1999. Ehrlichia ewingii is known to occur in dogs in several other states in the eastern United States and is transmitted by lone star ticks. • Bovine tuberculosis (TB) recently was found in an eighth domestic cattle herd in Michigan. All TB-positive cattle herds and the single hunting enclosure containing captive deer with TB were located in the northeastern portion of Michigan’s lower peninsula where TB is endemic in free-ranging deer. • Lead Poisoning at a Shooting Range: In May 1999, a yellow-rumped warbler and a gray squirrel found at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynn County, Georgia, were submitted to SCWDS for diagnosis of central nervous system disease. Lead poisoning was diagnosed in both animals. • SCWDS Research Coordinator Sam Linhart retired this June after 10 years with our organization. • New AVMA Euthanasia Panel American Veterinary Medical Association News from the WDA Conference [...] the Annual Meeting of the Wildlife Disease Association: • Towerkills: Dr. Don Forrester, with the University of Florida, indicated that U.

The <b>evening</b> <b>grosbeak</b> ranges in length from 16 to 22 cm and spans 30 to 36 cm across the wings. In a large sampling of grosbeaks in Pennsylvania during winter, males weighed from 38.7 to 86.1 g, {{with an average of}} 60 g, while females weighed from 43.2 to 73.5 g, with an average of 58.7 g. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 10.45 to 11.6 cm, the tail is 6 to 6.95 cm, the bill is 1.6 to 2 cm and the tarsus is 1.95 to 2.2 cm. The adult has a short black tail, black wings and a large pale bill. The adult male has a bright yellow forehead and body; its head is brown and there is a large white patch in the wing. The adult female is mainly olive-brown, greyer on the underparts and with white patches in the wings.|$|E
50|$|The {{hawfinch}} (Coccothraustes coccothraustes) {{has long}} been recognised as being closely related to other grosbeaks in the genera Mycerobas, Hesperiphona and Eophona.

50|$|Rollo Howard Beck {{was born}} in Los Gatos, California, {{and grew up in}} Berryessa working on apricot and prune orchards. He {{completed}} only an 8th grade education, but took an early interest in natural history, trapping gophers after school on neighborhood farms. One of his neighbors, Frank H. Holmes, was a good friend of the ornithologist Theodore Sherman Palmer. Palmer also introduced Beck to Charles Keeler, who studied birdlife of the San Francisco Bay Area, and Beck learned about upland birds hunting quail with Holmes. Beck’s interest and knowledge of birds grew, and he soon learned how to make ornithological specimens and mount birds for museum collections. He joined the American Ornithologists' Union in 1894, and was among the first members of the newly formed Cooper Ornithological Society which formed in San Jose, California. He participated in early ornithological expeditions to the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Yosemite, and Lake Tahoe with Holmes and Wilfred Hudson Osgood, and collected and helped describe the first eggs and nests of the western <b>evening</b> <b>grosbeak</b> and hermit warbler.|$|E

All true finches have 9 primary remiges and 12 rectrices. The basic plumage colour is brownish, sometimes greenish; many have considerable amounts of black, while white plumage is generally absent except as wing-bars or other signalling marks. Bright yellow and red carotenoid pigments are commonplace in this family, and thus blue structural colours are rather rare, as the yellow pigments turn the blue color into green. Many, but by no means all true finches have strong sexual dichromatism, the females typically lacking the bright carotenoid markings of males.|$|E
