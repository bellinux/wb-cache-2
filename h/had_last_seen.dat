5|$|During Season 5, it is {{revealed}} that Wilson's homeless brother Danny suffered from schizophrenia since adolescence, {{which is what}} caused him to run away. Wilson blames himself for his brother's homelessness, having hung up on Danny right before he disappeared. Wilson also reveals to House that he took the position at Princeton-Plainsboro because it was near the place he <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> Danny. When Wilson finds out that Danny is in the Psychiatric Ward of New York Mercy Hospital , House offers to come with him to keep him company, noting that it could end badly. However, when Wilson is let in to see his brother, House is busy with a differential with his team.|$|E
5|$|In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut {{for a large}} invited audience; it was {{remarked that}} his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his {{personal}} bearing was admirable {{for a man of}} eighty-six. He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do. While there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921. His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the Cimetière de Montparnasse. Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{dreams that}} it is December 1944 and that Marge is a soldier in World War II. Due to Marge being taken {{suddenly}} for overseas deployment while buying a Christmas tree the previous year, Lisa has sworn to never see another Christmas tree until Marge returns home safely. However, during Christmas of 1944, the family gets a telegram saying that Marge is missing in action. After hearing the news, Lisa runs away {{to the place where}} she <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> her mother, the Christmas Tree Farm. The owner of the place says that Marge paid for a tree the previous year but never picked it up. Lisa, believing the tree to be a symbol that Marge is alright, takes it home and decorates it together with Homer and Bart. Marge is then seen assassinating Adolf Hitler with an MP40 in a movie theater in France as he watches a propaganda film. When she walks away from the scene, the theater explodes behind her.|$|E
50|$|Edith {{went to see}} her neighbour, an {{agricultural}} worker {{by the name of}} Harry Beasley who lived at 16 Lower Quinton. Together they made their way to The Firs to alert Alfred Potter. Potter claimed to <b>have</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> Charles earlier in the day, slashing hedges in Hillground. The three of them set out {{in the direction of the}} spot where Charles <b>had</b> <b>last</b> been <b>seen</b> and eventually found his body near a hedgerow.|$|R

5|$|Before the 1991 season, Zerex {{ended their}} {{sponsorship}} of Kulwicki's team. Junior Johnson came calling again, {{looking for a}} driver for his revived second team that <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> Neil Bonnett behind the wheel in 1986. Kulwicki turned down Johnson's $1 million offer thinking that he had secured a sponsorship deal with Maxwell House Coffee. Johnson then went to Maxwell House himself and obtained the sponsorship for his new car, which Sterling Marlin was hired to drive instead. Kulwicki was forced to begin the season without a sponsor, paying all of the team's expenses {{out of his own}} pocket. At the opening race of the season, the 1991 Daytona 500, fivecars raced with paint schemes representing different branches of the United States military to show support for the American forces involved in the Gulf War. It was the first use of special paint schemes in NASCAR history. Kulwicki's car was sponsored by the United States Army in a one-race deal. After running the second and third races of the season in a plain white unsponsored car, Kulwicki's luck finding a sponsor changed for the better at Atlanta Motor Speedway.|$|E

25|$|Bittaker had {{a similar}} {{explanation}} as to the double murder of Jacqueline Lamp and Jackie Gilliam: he claimed Gilliam accepted an offer of money for sex and posing for pictures, and that he <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> the girls alone with Norris in his GMC van. With regards {{to the murder of}} Shirley Ledford, he claimed she had agreed to theatrically scream for the tape recorder, and that she was not tortured in his presence, but had been left alone with Norris.|$|E
25|$|The {{group was}} brought to the Feldafing DP camp near Munich, exhausted, {{demoralized}} and penniless. Here Halberstam's leadership qualities rose to the fore and he became the spokesman and leader of the religious survivors. He immediately arranged for the proper burial of those who had died by the train tracks, and demanded kosher food for the survivors. On the first Shabbat after liberation, he led the public prayer services in a newly opened synagogue and delivered a two-hour lecture, quoting from memory scholarly writings that he <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> years before.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{also note}} that Robert Young, the {{traveling}} companion with whom victim Russell Nelson was visiting Chicago {{at the time of}} his disappearance in October 1977, gave differing accounts of the youth's disappearance to both Nelson's family and investigators. To Nelson's family, Young had stated Nelson failed to arrive at a bar at a prearranged time; to investigators, Young claimed he <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> Nelson standing among a crowd who had gathered outside a Chicago bar and when his (Young's) attention was diverted for a few moments, Nelson simply disappeared. Investigators contend this could not have happened without his traveling companion noticing.|$|E
25|$|In February 1981, Amtrak {{restored}} the City of New Orleans name while retaining the overnight schedule; Amtrak hoped {{to capitalize on}} the popularity of the song written by Steve Goodman and recorded in 1972 by Arlo Guthrie. A Kansas City section began operation on April 29, 1984. Known as the River Cities, it separated at Centralia, Illinois (later Carbondale). This section ended on November 4, 1994. The northbound City of New Orleans began stopping at Gilman, Illinois, on October 26, 1986. Gilman <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> service in 1971; the Illini stopped there as well. Service to Cairo, Illinois, south of Carbondale, ended on October 25, 1987.|$|E
25|$|Historian Winfried Ludecke {{suggests}} that, upon leaving Port Arthur, Reilly voyaged to Imperial Japan in {{the company}} of an unknown mistress. If he did visit Japan, presumably to be paid for his espionage, he could not have stayed very long, for by June 1904 he appeared in Paris, France. During the brief time Reilly spent in Paris, he renewed his close acquaintance with William Melville, sometimes incorrectly described as the first director general of MI5, whom Reilly <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> just prior to his 1899 departure from London. Reilly's meeting with Melville is most significant, for within a matter of weeks Melville was to use Reilly's expertise in what would later become known as the D'Arcy Affair.|$|E

25|$|Five {{months after}} Nodder had been {{formally}} {{charged with the}} murder of Mona Tinsley, he appeared at Nottingham Assizes to be tried for her murder. His second trial began on 22 November 1937, and again saw Norman Birkett appear on behalf of the prosecution, and Maurice Healy on behalf of the defence. Healy again argued his client had no motive to commit the murder. Nodder himself testified at this second trial, claiming that he had not seen Mona after he had placed her on a bus at Worksop, with view to her visiting her aunt in Sheffield. In response to questioning from both the prosecution and defence, Nodder denied killing the child, and alleged she had been murdered by an unknown individual after he <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> her.|$|E
25|$|Then {{the trio}} of Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which arrive. They charge Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT, because only Meg has a strong enough bond with him. Their father <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> Charles Wallace {{when he was a}} baby and Calvin had only just met him. They each give her a gift. Mrs Whatsit gives Meg her love. Mrs Who quotes to Meg a passage from the Bible about God {{choosing}} the foolish of the world to confound the wise, and the weak to defeat the strong (1st Corinthians 1:27-29). Mrs Which tells Meg that she has one thing that IT does not have. Upon arriving at the building where IT is housed, Charles Wallace is still there under IT's influence. Meg realizes that the one thing she has that IT does not is love. She focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT's control. Mrs Who, Mrs Which and Mrs Whatsit tesser the Murrys and Calvin back to Earth. In the vegetable garden they are reunited with Mrs. Murry and the twins. Mrs Whatsit says that, although she and the others like the spectacle of the family reuniting, they have to go somewhere. Before Mrs Whatsit finishes her sentence, she and the others disappear.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 {{one of the}} {{previous}} season's top scorers Barry Conlon was loaned out to Chesterfield before signing permanently shortly afterwards. Puzzled supporters questioned Woods and chairman John Fenty over the decision which was later revealed to be because the player {{was considered to be}} a disruptive influence and wasn't turning up for training. Woods began to clear out the ranks, with Danny Boshell, Danny North, Jamie Clarke, Barry Conlon and Grant Normington all being released. Whilst Chris Jones was loaned out only months after being signed. Woods began to make some fresh signings, notably Lee Peacock, Tommy Wright and former loanee Dean Sinclair joined the club. Woods would also heavily use the loan system in a bid to change the club's fortunes. On 6 March 2010 Grimsby ended a club record 25 game winless streak by beating promotion chasing Shrewsbury Town at Blundell Park, 3–0. The 25 game streak <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> Grimsby win in the league with a 2–0 away victory at Torquay United on 19 September 2009. During this time the Mariners had drawn 15 games and lost 10. The game would also come as the first career victory for Neil Woods. The Mariners went on to win four and draw one of their last six games to give them a chance of league survival going into the last game of the season. However, they were defeated 3–0 by Burton Albion, and thus were relegated from the Football League {{for the first time in}} nearly 100 years.|$|E

50|$|Other {{employees}} at the RV park corroborated Robyn's account. If it was Wykel, it was the <b>last</b> time he <b>had</b> been seen.

Robyn's account also linked him to Wykel's Mercedes during the time it was unaccounted for.|$|R

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the debate [...] the government's law officers and Chief Whip met, and decided that Profumo should assert his innocence in a personal statement to the House. Such statements are, by long-standing tradition, made on the particular honour of the member and are accepted by the House without question. In the early hours of 22 March Profumo and his lawyers met with ministers [...] and together agreed an appropriate wording. Later that morning Profumo made his statement to a crowded House. He acknowledged friendships with Keeler and Ward, the former of whom, he said, he <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> in December 1961. He had met [...] "a Mr Ivanov" [...] twice, also in 1961. He stated: [...] "There was no impropriety whatsoever in my acquaintanceship with Miss Keeler", [...] and added: [...] "I shall not hesitate to issue writs for libel and slander if scandalous allegations are made or repeated outside the House." [...] That afternoon, Profumo was photographed at Sandown Park Racecourse in the company of the Queen Mother.|$|E
500|$|That night, President Lincoln {{was shot}} and mortally wounded by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer. The {{shooting}} of the President {{was part of a}} conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, Johnson, and Seward the same night. Seward barely survived his wounds, while Johnson escaped attack as his would-be assassin, George Atzerodt, got drunk instead of killing the vice president. Leonard J. Farwell, a fellow boarder at the Kirkwood House, awoke Johnson with news of Lincoln's shooting at Ford's Theatre. Johnson rushed to the President's deathbed, where he remained a short time, on his return promising, [...] "They shall suffer for this. They shall suffer for this." [...] Lincoln died at 7:22am the next morning; Johnson's swearing in occurred between 10 and 11am with Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase presiding in the presence of most of the Cabinet. Johnson's demeanor was described by the newspapers as [...] "solemn and dignified". Some Cabinet members <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> Johnson, apparently drunk, at the inauguration. At noon, Johnson conducted his first Cabinet meeting in the Treasury Secretary's office, and asked all members to remain in their positions.|$|E
500|$|A second {{task force}} {{built around the}} {{aircraft}} carrier [...] replaced the two battleships in September 1943. The other elements of this force were the heavy cruisers [...] and Tuscaloosa, as well as five destroyers; Hustvedt remained in command. Rangers air wing {{was made up of}} three squadrons: VF-41 with 27 Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters, VB-41 with 27 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, and VT-41 with 18 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers. Prior to Rangers arrival the Home Fleet was assigned only a single aircraft carrier, the elderly , which was unavailable for operations at the time as she was undergoing a refit. Ranger <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>seen</b> combat against Vichy French forces while supporting the Operation Torch landings in Morocco during November 1942, and had later been used to ferry aircraft to North Africa and train aircrews off the United States east coast. On 8 September 1943 {{the main body of the}} Home Fleet, including the American task force, sortied in response to reports that Tirpitz, Scharnhorst and nine destroyers had put to sea. The Allied force returned to the Home Fleet's main base at Scapa Flow the next day after it was learned that the German ships had returned to port after briefly attacking Allied positions on Spitsbergen.|$|E
