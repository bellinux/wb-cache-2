Measures of {{their population}} density vary widely, from 50 to 550 individuals per square kilometer (250acres), but these numbers are thought to reflect only small, gum-rich areas, and therefore only small, clustered populations with an overall low population density.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with carvel edge-to-edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the clinker planking is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.|$|E

The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things). In the Epicurean system, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring.

Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely. It was decided that the plutonium gun would receive {{the bulk of the}} research effort, since it was the project with the least amount of uncertainty involved. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the uranium gun-type bomb could be more easily adapted from it.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the final}} {{decision}} on {{the location of the}} new capital territory, the local landowners and residents of Queanbeyan looked favourably on the possibility of having the territory located nearby. Such a result, it was hoped, would bring improvements to local infrastructure, increase the demand for local goods and services, and raise land values. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the existing freehold arrangements would remain, and that those whose land was not required for the city itself would {{be in a position to}} capitalise on the new circumstances.|$|E

5|$|According to Jagdish Narain Tiwari and Dilip Chakravati, the Matrikas were {{existent}} {{as early}} as the Vedic period and the Indus Valley civilization. Seals with rows of seven feminine deities or priestesses are cited as evidence for the theory. The Rigveda (IX 102.4) speaks of a group of seven Mothers who control the preparation of Soma, but the earliest clear description appears in select chapters of the epic Mahabharata dated to 1st century AD. Wangu believes that Matrika description in Mahabharata is rooted in the group of seven females depicted on Indus valley seals. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the people locally worshipped these goddesses, such an example is also described in Zimmer Heinrich book The Art Of Indian Asia, about the seven shrines of seven Mother Goddesses worshipped locally.|$|E
5|$|After Sibelius's {{death in}} 1957, {{news of the}} Eighth Symphony's {{destruction}} was made public, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since then, several short manuscript sketches have been tentatively identified with the Eighth, three of which (comprising less than three minutes of music) were recorded by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra in 2011. While a few musicologists have speculated that, if further fragments can be identified, {{it may be possible}} to reconstruct the entire work, others have suggested that this is unlikely given the ambiguity of the extant material. The propriety of publicly performing music that Sibelius himself had rejected has also been questioned.|$|E
