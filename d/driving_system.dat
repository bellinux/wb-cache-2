However, there are in certain places where additional lanes are available. In town areas, federal roads may become four-lane roads to increase traffic capacity. In hilly areas, additional third climbing lane is available for slower vehicles such as buses and lorries.|$|E
500|$|During its {{production}} run from March 1942 to June 1943, the Panzer IV Ausf.G went through further modifications, including another armor upgrade {{which consisted of}} a [...] face-hardened appliqué steel plate welded (later bolted) to the glacis—in total, frontal armor was now [...] thick. This decision to increase frontal armor was favorably received according to troop reports on 8 November 1942, despite technical problems of the <b>driving</b> <b>system</b> due to added weight. At this point, {{it was decided that}} 50% of Panzer IV production would be fitted with [...] thick additional armor plates. On 5 January 1943, Hitler decided that all Panzer IV should have [...] frontal armor. To simplify production, the vision ports {{on either side of the}} turret and the loader's forward vision port in the turret front were removed, while a rack for two spare road wheels was installed on the track guard on the left side of the hull. Complementing this, brackets for seven spare track links were added to the glacis plate.|$|E

40|$|Cooperative <b>driving</b> <b>systems</b> {{influence}} individual vehicles, {{either through}} advisory or autonomous actions, {{so as to}} optimize the collective behavior in terms of throughput, safety, fuel consumption and/or emissions. Cooperative <b>driving</b> <b>systems</b> need to function properly in {{a vast amount of}} different traffic scenarios. However, performing field-tests with physical prototypes is time-consuming, cost-intensive and potentially unsafe. This makes the development and evaluation process of cooperative <b>driving</b> <b>systems</b> a complicated activity. In order to support manufacturers and governments in dealing with these challenges, TNO has created the software package PreScan as well as the MOBYSEVI tool suite.

2500|$|The Waseda University (Japan) and NTT Docomo's {{manufacturers}} {{have succeeded in}} creating a shape-shifting robot WD-2. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided {{the positions of the}} necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a <b>driving</b> <b>system</b> with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three degrees of freedom. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To [...] "copy" [...] a face, they need only a 3D scanner to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.|$|E

5000|$|The {{success in}} the {{automated}} <b>driving</b> <b>system</b> {{has been known to}} be successful in situations like rural road settings. Rural road settings would be a setting in which there is lower amounts of traffic and lower differentiation between driving abilities and types of drivers. [...] "The greatest challenge in the development of automated functions is still inner-city traffic, where an extremely wide range of road users must be considered from all directions." [...] This technology is progressing to a more reliable way of the automated driving cars to switch from auto-mode to driver mode. Auto-mode is the mode that is set in order for the automated actions to take over, while the driver mode is the mode set in order to have the operator controlling all functions of the car and taking the responsibilities of operating the vehicle (Automated <b>driving</b> <b>system</b> not engaged).|$|E

40|$|A novel {{synchronization}} {{scheme is}} proposed {{for a class}} of chaotic systems, extending the concept of multi-switching synchronization to combination synchronization such that the state variables {{of two or more}} <b>driving</b> <b>systems</b> synchronize with different state variables of the response system, simultaneously. The new scheme, multi-switching combination synchronization (MSCS), represents a significant extension of earlier multi-switching schemes in which two chaotic systems, in a driver-response configuration, are multi-switched to synchronize up to a scaling factor. In MSCS, the chaotic <b>driving</b> <b>systems</b> multi-switch a response chaotic system in combination synchronization. For certain choices of the scaling factors, MSCS reduces to multi-switching synchronization, implying that the latter is a special case of MSCS. A theoretical approach to control design, based on backstepping, is presented and validated using numerical simulations...|$|R

40|$|It is {{inevitable}} {{that as a}} person ages they will encounter different physical and cognitive impairments as well as dynamic social issues. We started this project {{under the assumption that}} autonomous driving would greatly benefit the fastest growing population in developed countries, the elderly. However, the larger question at hand was how are older drivers going to interact with future automated <b>driving</b> <b>systems?</b> It was through the qualitative research we conducted {{that we were able to}} uncover the answer to this question; older drivers are not willing to give up “control” to autonomous cars. As interaction designers, we need to define what type of interactions need to occur in these future automated <b>driving</b> <b>systems,</b> so older drivers still feel independent and in control when driving. Lawrence D. Burns, former Vice president of Research and Development at General Motors and author of Reinventing the Automobile Personal Urban Mobility for the 21 st Century talks about two driving factors that will shape the future of the automobile. These factors are energy and connectivity (Burns et al., 2010). We would add a third one, which is control. If we address these three factors we might be able to bridge the gap between how we drive today and how we will drive in the future and thus create more cohesive future automated <b>driving</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
