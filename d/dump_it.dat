5|$|Horseshoe crabs convert {{nitrogenous}} wastes to ammonia and <b>dump</b> <b>it</b> via their gills, and excrete {{other wastes}} as feces via the anus. They also have nephridia ("little kidneys"), which extract other wastes for excretion as urine. Ammonia is so toxic {{that it must}} be diluted rapidly with large quantities of water. Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so much water and therefore convert nitrogenous wastes to other chemicals, which they excrete as dry matter. Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and Malpighian tubules. The tubules filter wastes out of the blood and dump them into the hindgut as solids, a system that has evolved independently in insects and several groups of arachnids.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{difficulty is}} the current stringency of environmental legislation. In the past, a common method {{of getting rid of}} unexploded chemical ammunition was to detonate or <b>dump</b> <b>it</b> at sea; this is currently prohibited in most countries.|$|E
25|$|Lake Erie froze over by December 14; {{this was}} a record. An ice-covered Lake Erie usually puts an end to lake effect snowstorms, because the wind cannot pick up {{moisture}} from the lake's surface, convert the moisture to snow and then <b>dump</b> <b>it</b> when the winds reach shore.|$|E

During the first week of June, the court travelled to the site where the peer's body was found. Mohamed M'Barek was transported in leg chains for the one-day reenactment. Once they arrived, M'Barek demonstrated that he had enough strength to have acted alone.

500|$|... "Death Has a Shadow" [...] is {{the pilot}} {{episode of the}} American {{animated}} television series Family Guy. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 31, 1999, just after Super Bowl XXXIII. The episode is based on series creator Seth MacFarlane's original pitch to Fox, The Life of Larry, and is a remake of the original Family Guy pilot. In the episode, Peter loses his job after drinking too much at a stag party and falls asleep at work. He signs up for welfare to keep his wife Lois from finding out, but gets much more money than he expected. After spending his money foolishly Lois finds out and Peter decides to <b>dump</b> <b>it</b> from a blimp at the Super Bowl. He is arrested for welfare fraud and must await his family's rescue.|$|E
500|$|In Taft's annual message sent to Congress in December 1910, {{he urged}} {{a free trade}} accord with Canada. [...] Britain at that time still handled Canada's foreign relations, and Taft found the British and Canadian governments willing. Many in Canada opposed an accord, fearing the U.S. would <b>dump</b> <b>it</b> when {{convenient}} as it had the 1854 Elgin-Marcy Treaty in 1866, and farm and fisheries interests in the United States were also opposed. After January 1911 talks with Canadian officials, Taft had the agreement, which was not a treaty, introduced into Congress and it passed in late July. The Canadian Parliament, led by Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, had deadlocked over the issue. Canadians turned Laurier out of office in the September 1911 election and Robert Borden became the new prime minister. No cross-border agreement was concluded, and the debate deepened divisions [...] in the Republican Party.|$|E

2500|$|Traditional naval {{doctrine}} envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines. This {{view was}} challenged when army airman General Billy Mitchell demonstrated {{the capability of}} aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel. In the interwar debate that followed, some saw the carrier as defensive in nature, providing air cover to protect the battle group from shore-based aircraft. Carrier-based aircraft were lighter in design and had not {{been shown to be}} as lethal. The adage [...] "Capital ships cannot withstand land-based air power" [...] was well known. Aviation proponents, however, imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power. Halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system. When he testified at Admiral Husband Kimmel's hearing after the Pearl Harbor debacle he summed up American carrier tactics being to [...] "get to the other fellow with everything you have {{as fast as you can}} and to <b>dump</b> <b>it</b> on him." [...] Halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon.|$|E

2500|$|Hills or ridges {{in front}} of the {{railroad}} road bed would have to have a flat-bottomed, V shaped [...] "cut" [...] made to get the railroad through the ridge or hill. The type of material determined the slope of the V and how much material would have to be removed. Ideally, these cuts would be matched with valley fills that could use the dug out material to bring the road bed up to grade--cut and fill construction. In the 1860s there was no heavy equipment {{that could be used to}} make these cuts or haul it away to make the fills. The options were to dig it out by pick and shovel, haul the hillside material by wheelbarrow and/or horse or mule cart or blast it loose. To blast a V shaped cut out, they had to drill several holes up to [...] deep in the material, fill them with black powder, and blast the material away. Since the Central Pacific was in a hurry, they were profligate users of black powder to blast their way though the hills. The only disadvantage came when a nearby valley needed fill to get across it. The explosive technique often blew most of the potential fill material down the hillside, making it unavailable for fill. Initially, many valleys were bridged by [...] "temporary" [...] trestles that could be rapidly built and were later replaced by much lower maintenance and permanent solid fill. The existing railroad made transporting and putting material in valleys much easier—load it on railway dump cars, haul where needed and <b>dump</b> <b>it</b> over the side of the trestle.|$|E
