25|$|At {{three o'clock}} Father William Corby, the University president, {{met with his}} wisest assistants and they {{determined}} that nothing could be done but close the college for the year. An hour after he communicated the decision to the students assembled in the church. Students {{did not want to}} leave, but Fr. Corby {{made it clear that the}} University could not provide any accommodations. Hence, the students were sent home for the semester. The loss was estimated at $200,000 and only $45,000 was recovered from the insurance. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> blow, for in three hours was wiped out the result of thirty-five years of hard, grueling sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was {{the soul}} music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). He {{considered}} it the least satisfactory {{of the three}} he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] {{in many of the}} album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: [...] "He wasn't up for it... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> time because I think {{there was a lot of}} cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture... I didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: [...] "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.|$|E
500|$|Elias Kifle Maraim Beyene, a {{survivor}} from Ethiopia being {{asked about his}} memory of Michael Jackson after his death remembers: [...] "I won't ever forget Michael Jackson because his contribution to the song We are the World had a very significant effect on my life. I am 50 now but 25 years ago I was living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which {{at that time was}} suffering from a long drought and famine. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> situation. Lots of people became sick and many more died. Around one million people in all were killed by the famine. In 1984 Michael Jackson, along with a number of other leading musicians, made the song We are the World to raise money for Africa. We received a lot of aid from the world and I {{was one of those who}} directly benefitted from it. The wheat flour that was distributed to the famine victims was different to the usual cereal we bought at the market. We baked a special bread from it. The local people named the bread after the great artist and it became known as Michael Bread. It was soft and delicious.|$|E

500|$|Belle {{appeared}} in the Broadway musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast. The role was originated by actress Susan Egan, who was initially reluctant to audition for Beauty and the Beast because she [...] "thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> idea for Disney to put a cartoon on Broadway." [...] However, her agent managed to convince her otherwise, and Egan ultimately turned down callbacks for roles in the musicals My Fair Lady, Carousel and Grease in favor of starring as Belle in Beauty and the Beast because she {{had always wanted to}} originate a Broadway role. Egan had never watched Beauty and the Beast prior to her audition, relying solely on [...] "her own creative instincts" [...] instead. Egan's performance earned her a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical at the 48th Tony Awards. A total of seventeen actresses have portrayed Belle in the Broadway musical, among them recording artists Debbie Gibson and Toni Braxton, The Sopranos Jamie-Lynn Sigler, and Disney Channel alumnae Christy Carlson Romano and Anneliese van der Pol, the latter of whom became Broadway's final Belle when the show ended its thirteen-year-long run in 2007. Actress Sarah Litzsinger remains Broadway's longest-running Belle.|$|E
500|$|Revere {{entered the}} 2014 season healthy, and, amidst chaos and {{position}} battles elsewhere, {{he was the}} preeminent starter in center field. Before the season, Pat Egan of Phillies Nation published an article declaring the Phillies as the clear winners of the trade that brought Revere to Philadelphia. Though initially writers thought the Twins received a terrific return and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> trade for the Phillies, Worley was ultimately outrighted of the Twins' roster and traded, and May's status as a top prospect languished, whereas Revere had emerged as a viable everyday center fielder who was under contract with the Phillies through 2018. On April 1, 2014, Revere set a new MLB record for most plate appearances without a home run (1,410) by a non-pitcher. Despite his initial preeminence, because of sore ribs (caused by a diving catch in the outfield), backup Tony Gwynn, Jr. started four consecutive games in center field (beyond the time Revere needed to recover from his injury due to Gwynn's success at the plate) while Revere, who had recently struggled at the plate, was on the bench. However, a few days later, Revere came up to bat {{in the eighth inning}} in a scoreless game, and hit an RBI single, which re-implanted him atop the Phillies' starting lineup. As for Gwynn, Revere commented, ...|$|E
500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act for the tour. Adam [...] "MCA" [...] Yauch {{of the group}} recollected: [...] "One day, Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, came in and said, 'Hey guess what—Madonna's manager called. Do {{you guys want to}} go on tour with her?" [...] DeMann had asked for another group called The Fat Boys, but Simmons did not manage them and lied, saying [...] "Oh, the Fat Boys have another gig that week. What about Run–D.M.C.?" [...] But they were too {{expensive}} according to DeMann, and hence ultimately Beastie Boys were chosen. Adam [...] "Ad-Rock" [...] Horovitz from the band commented: [...] "It's not like any of us knew Madonna that much, but we all used to hang out at Dancetaria [...] so we knew about each other. I don't know why she {{thought it would be a}} good idea , though. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> idea. But it was great for her in a way because we were so awful that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy." [...] The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other. A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides.|$|E

500|$|Friedman {{defended his}} {{activity}} in Chile {{on the grounds}} that, in his opinion, the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but {{also contributed to the}} amelioration of Pinochet's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990. That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom, in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom. In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose, he said the following: [...] "Chile is not a politically free system, and I do not condone the system. But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role. ...The conditions {{of the people in the}} past few years has been getting better and not worse. They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system." [...] In 1984, Friedman stated that he has [...] "never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile." [...] In 1991 he said: [...] "I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> political regime. The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market. [...] In Chile, the drive for political freedom, that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success, ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy. Now, at long last, Chile has all three things: political freedom, human freedom and economic freedom. Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether, now that it has political freedom, that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom." [...] He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states.|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "To me, 1969 really suggested the death knell of the counter-culture revolution. The terrible event of Charles Manson showed the cultism of the period; I was always wary of crowds. I didn't go to Woodstock. I didn't want to be in a mudflat waiting to get into a portable toilet. I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> idea. So I stayed at my office at Warner Bros.…I don't even know what happened around then, for many reasons.

[...] One of the men forced me {{to look into the}} mirror. [...] There I saw − not the reflection of myself, but rather of some thin, ape-like man, gruesome and horrible looking, grinding his teeth. [...] I thought to myself, 'Maybe I've really gone mad!' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> moment, but I regained my bearings and spat upon the mirror. [...] You know I think they liked that....I thought a great deal:'Will I survive or will I really go mad?' That was not good. [...] I did not have faith in myself, see?..., of course, know their business, their science. [...] But they do not know the Caucasians. [...] Maybe every Caucasian is insane, as far as they are concerned. [...] Well, who will drive whom mad? [...] Nothing developed. [...] They stuck to their guns and I to mine. [...] In Tiflis, they didn't torture me. [...] Apparently they thought that the Germans can make no mistakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of contract law {{began in the}} Church courts, following Roman law. These courts claimed (with some validity) to enforce all promises made by oath, or by [...] "pledge of faith". The man who pledges his faith, or on his soul, arguably has pawned his soul, and in so doing, has left his salvation to actions of another. Henry II of England asserted his jurisdiction over such cases. Thomas Becket claimed concurrent jurisdiction for the Church. Henry won. From that time onward, the royal court was always at the ready to prohibit ecclesiastical judges from entertaining a breach of faith, unless both parties were clerks (church clerics) or the matter lay {{outside the realm of}} the temporal. The method was to issue a writ of prohibition, prohibiting the church court from hearing and ruling on the case. The practice developed whereby a contractor would seek relief in a church court and renounce all right to a writ of prohibition. Sometimes the litigant would not receive the decision he wanted in the ecclesiastic court, and then would renounce his pledge, and seek a writ of prohibition from the common law court. Bracton explained that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> sin to seek a writ of prohibition when one had promised not to seek one. This was a crime that deserved imprisonment. Jurisdiction over such matters, as well as marriages and wills remained contentious in Bracton's day.|$|E
2500|$|Templer {{remained}} with the battalion until mid-October 1917 when, now aged 19, {{he was sent}} to the 7th/8th (Service) Battalion on the Western Front. The battalion was a Kitchener's Army unit serving as part of the 49th Brigade of the 16th (Irish) Division. However, he was posted to 'C' Company of the 1st Battalion in mid-November a Regular Army unit, then serving in the 107th Brigade of the 36th (Ulster) Division. Soon after Templer's arrival, the battalion took part in the Battle of Cambrai in late November, although Templer himself took no part in the battle and the battalion, and his 'C' Company in particular, sustained heavy losses. In early February 1918 Templer's battalion, the 1st Irish Fusiliers, was transferred to the 108th Brigade, due to a severe manpower shortage in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, which necessitated the reduction of all British brigades from four to three battalions. He was promoted to lieutenant on 16 February 1918. On 20 March Templer, seriously ill, passed out while in the trenches, suffering from acute diphtheria, and he was later evacuated to England. The German Army launched their Spring Offensive the day after and, while he was away his battalion sustained over 770 casualties out of a strength of some 800 men. He returned to the battalion in , now composed of mainly teenagers, and fought with it in the Hundred Days Offensive, which saw the war turn in favour of the Allies and eventually resulted in the Armistice with Germany being signed and the war ending on 11 November 1918. Templer was considerably lucky during the war, having not been wounded, although, as with many others of his generation, it left its mark on him in other ways. He wrote, many years later, [...] "I still sometimes in my sleep at night hear the screams of the wounded horses, galloping on the ground, tripping over barbed wire, and treading on their own guts. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> thing to have to witness, worse in some ways than the human casualties". A week before his death Templer had this dream again, over sixty years after the war.|$|E
