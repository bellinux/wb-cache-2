50|$|In the 1970s, {{computer}} scientist Marvin Minsky was trying <b>to</b> develop <b>machines</b> {{that would have}} human-like abilities. When {{he was trying to}} create solutions for some of the difficulties he encountered he came across Bartlett's work and decided that if he was ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get <b>machines</b> <b>to</b> act like humans he needed them to use their stored knowledge to carry out processes. To compensate for that he created what was known as the frame construct, which was a way to represent knowledge in machines. His frame construct can be seen as an extension and elaboration of the schema construct. He created the frame knowledge concept as a way to interact with new information. He proposed that fixed and broad information would be represented as the frame, but it would also be composed of slots that would accept a range of values; but if the world didn't have a value for a slot, then it would be filled by a default value. Because of Minsky's work, computers now have a stronger impact on psychology. In the 1980s, David Rumelhart extended Minsky's ideas, creating an explicitly psychological theory of the mental representation of complex knowledge.|$|R

40|$|ANGLÈS] How can {{we build}} {{a system for}} traffic {{classification}} so that different QoS levels can be identified? How can we analyse different network parameters and identify a specific QoS for every flow? The purp ose of this work {{is to build a}} system capable of classifying traffic according to flows' different QoS requirements. Next, classification results are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> b e used to improve the state-of-the-art traffic engineering techniques in SDN networks. As in SDN networks ele- ments are programmable from the controller, different QoS paths can b e implemented so that different traffic flows can see diferent QoS. This traffic classification system go es b eyond the classical state-of-the-art classification into mice/elephant flows. We want to identify different priority classes so that higher priority classes are able to access to more network resources. We seek improving the overall network p erformance. The approach for tackling this problem would be somehow equal to the approach used for building a new machine learning system. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> define a set of variables, measure them, and classify traffic according to the values of that variables into different classes. We will start defining a measurement layer for SDN. To classify trafic we first need to observe what prop erties is exhibiting a traffic flow. This first layer will enables us to measure different flow prop erties as well as p erforming other management tasks. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> define a layer so that we could gather flow information with minimal network over-head. This system will b e implemented distributely in the switches and will leverage flow tables switches to improve its functionalities. Second we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> use the information captured to calculate various flow statistical fingerprints so that we can infer their network resources requirements. We will target only QoS signifficant flows. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> develop a <b>machine</b> learning algorithm in the scop e of semi-sup ervised learning that would learn form lab elled and unlab elled data to infer the most likely QoS. In particular, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> apply a <b>machine</b> learning algorithm known as Laplacian SVM to classify various network traffic flows into different QoS classes. Finally, we will prototyp e this algorithm and try it in a real world data set.

A machine was never made {{available}} to them like Wright said.An engineer, who was part of the Parkwyn Association, built a mold for making the concrete blocks. First, concrete was poured into the mold, and then the mold was removed and the block was set outside to cure overnight. Proper curing strengthens the blocks and makes them more durable. Water is needed to cure the blocks and the closest supply was from the nearby pond, so that was the water used. [...] The color added to the blocks was a mix of red and yellow, creating a shade of orange. Rae Levin chose the color for the blocks. Unskilled laborers were hired from a local university to make the blocks. They were mostly college students interested in the project. Over 15,000 blocks were built.|$|R
