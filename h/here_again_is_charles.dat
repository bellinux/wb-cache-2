60|$|Here was a {{long table}} set with choicest chinaware and silver, and lavishly {{furnished}} with food of that expensive and spectacular sort of which the devotees of sport are supposed to <b>be</b> fond. <b>Here</b> <b>again</b> <b>was</b> to be perceived the liberal and florid taste of the gentleman with the urban cognomenal prefix.|$|R

60|$|<b>Here,</b> <b>again,</b> <b>is</b> {{a little}} bit to show Carpaccio's execution. It is his signature: only a little wall-lizard, holding the paper in its mouth, perfect; yet so small that you can {{scarcely}} see its feet, and that I could not, with my finest-pointed brush, copy their stealthy action.|$|R

60|$|His cool, easy speech, his {{familiar}} swagger, the smile {{with which he}} regarded her did {{not in the least}} deceive Madeline. The gray was still in his face.

60|$|The {{peace of}} the Valley Dor thus assured, the green warriors {{dispersed}} to their desolate sea bottoms, while we of Helium returned to our own country. <b>Here</b> <b>again</b> <b>was</b> a throne offered me, since no word had been received from the missing Jeddak of Helium, Tardos Mors, grandfather of Dejah Thoris, or his son, Mors Kajak, Jed of Helium, her father.|$|R

60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>again</b> <b>was</b> {{legitimate}} {{cause for}} merriment, {{but in the}} end matters were compromised by a lump of biltong and a piece of bread being thrown to John {{from the other end of}} the room. He caught them and began to eat, trying to conceal his ravenous hunger as much as possible from the circle of onlookers who clustered round to watch the operation.|$|R
