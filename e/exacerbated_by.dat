40|$|A {{major feature}} in Mercosur {{agreement}} {{is the presence}} of asymmetries among members, in terms of size as well as in development of regions involved. This is one key issue for the success of the process of integration. This paper analyses the regional impacts of trade policies, based on a general equilibrium model of economic geography adapted from Krugman (1996). The scope of the integrating process was analysed through three dimensions of the policy: tariffs remotion, reduction of boarder costs, and infra-structure policy. Based on this instruments eight scenarios were constructed, under different assumptions for factor mobility. The results from the experiments carried out show that the outcome of the integrating process is closely linked to the companion set of policies, that is, regional disparities can be attenuated or <b>exacerbating</b> <b>by</b> timing and intensity of different policy measures. ...|$|R

5|$|Coming {{from a small}} {{domestic}} market, Iceland's {{banks have}} financed their expansion with loans on the interbank lending market and, more recently, by deposits from outside Iceland (which are also a form of external debt). Households also took on {{a large amount of}} debt, equivalent to 213% of disposable income, which led to inflation. This inflation was <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> the practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds – effectively, printing money on demand.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently, Bangui {{also became}} the key centre {{for social and}} {{cultural}} activity in the region, when new institutions were established in the city. However, political turmoil in the country, rampant corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic recession in the 1970s <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> a fall in international prices for its major exports.

5|$|Discussions on {{the need}} to build an {{underground}} transportation system in Buenos Aires began in the late nineteenth century, alongside the tramway system, {{which was one of the}} most extensive in the world at the time.

5|$|During {{the same}} year, however, he allowed his pro-American {{minister}} of defense, General Lon Nol, {{to crack down}} on leftist activities, crushing the Pracheachon by accusing its members of subversion and subservience to Hanoi.

40|$|Bangladesh {{has been}} {{fighting}} a losing battle over the last 34 years with no indication of even a minimal positive impact on women 2 ̆ 7 s participation in the Parliament. Women represent only two per cent of the parliamentary seats. In holding ministries, their positions never exceed three per cent. Nearly 80 per cent of the Parliamentary Standing Committees have no women. The government 2 ̆ 7 s affirmative measure has conceived a highly flawed vision that essentially promotes disrespect for the notion of 2 ̆ 7 equality 2 ̆ 7 and makes women MPs 2 ̆ 7 ornamental and passive beneficiaries 2 ̆ 7. In addition, the sociocultural dynamics that legitimate women 2 ̆ 7 s inequality have posed a serious challenge to the constitutional approach to equality, <b>exacerbating</b> <b>by</b> political requirements that force women to further remain beyond the purview of power. Given the reality, a substantial reconstruction of the whole politico-legal approach is not only desirable but also essential to combat women 2 ̆ 7 s disadvantaged positions in the Parliament...|$|R
