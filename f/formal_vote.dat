5|$|The {{procedure}} for modifying the alphabet or the chart is to propose {{the change in}} the Journal of the IPA. (See, for example, August 2008 on a open central vowel and August 2011 on central approximants.) Reactions to the proposal may be published in the same or subsequent issues of the Journal (as in August 2009 on the open central vowel). A formal proposal is then put to the Council of the IPA – which is elected by the membership – for further discussion and a <b>formal</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E
5|$|At present, it is {{not clear}} what {{evidence}} the President may rely on to be satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide the issue. In the Sarawak case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg, decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, the court found that the phrase ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the Members of Parliament was a term of art which had to be signified by a <b>formal</b> <b>vote</b> of no confidence taken by the legislature. In contrast, a Sabah court held in Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote. This might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May the {{conclave}} unanimously elected Orsini as Pope. He had {{not been}} seen as a serious candidate in past conclaves because he did not have political experience. Orsini was 75 at the time, and it took the cardinals two days to convince him to accept his election. He was recorded to have spent the night before his election sleepless and in tears. Even when the cardinals had taken him into the Sistine Chapel for the <b>formal</b> <b>vote</b> to elect him pope after they had been convinced he would accept, he was still unwilling to accept his own election. Ultimately, he only accepted it after being convinced of it by Agustín Pipia the Master of the Dominican Order, of which he was a member. Upon accepting his election, he attempted to take the name Benedict XIV, which would have recognized Antipope Benedict XIII, the last Avignon Pope during the Western Schism. Lawyers from the Roman Curia eventually persuaded Orisini to take the name Benedict XIII.|$|E

Hannegan, former Postmaster General James Farley, US Senator John W. Bricker, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, former federal judge Fred M. Vinson, Ohio Governor Frank Lausche, and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson. After Cincinnati Reds owner Warren Giles and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley raised strong opposition to Frick, formerly the front runner, New York Yankees co-owner Larry MacPhail began to advocate for Chandler. When the owners met in Cleveland, Ohio on April 24, 1945 {{to vote for a}} new commissioner, Chandler's name was not on the short list; the candidates were Frick, Farley, Hannegan, Vinson, Lausche, and Patterson. None of the candidates received the required two-thirds majority, and after lobbying by MacPhail and New York Giants owner Horace Stoneham, the owners took an informal vote to see if anyone had the potential to be elected. Chandler's name appeared in the top three on each of the sixteen ballots. Encouraged, the owners then held another <b>formal</b> <b>vote.</b> After two ballots, Chandler received the necessary majority; a third vote was taken to make the choice unanimous.|$|E

In many cases one member of an assembly may by convention not normally vote, but will exercise a casting vote in case of deadlock.

All Cabinet Ministers must be Members of Parliament (MPs) and are collectively responsible to it. The Prime Minister and all other ministers take office upon receiving a warrant by the Governor-General.

By this time some {{two-thirds of the}} state's population resided in and around Adelaide, but they only elected one-third {{of the members of}} the legislature. In many cases, a rural vote was worth at least double a vote in Adelaide.

40|$|International {{organizations}} are equilibrium outcomes that balance {{the power and}} interests of the leading state and the member countries. Institutional design is endogenous to this interaction, and includes membership, <b>formal</b> <b>voting</b> rights and informal governance procedures. The model specifies how three particular forms of power interact. Structural power represents the outside options of the leading state and the externalities that its participation generates for other members (Strange 1988). <b>Formal</b> <b>voting</b> rights set {{the policy of the}} organization and create the parameters within which informal influence is exercised. Informal influence represents an insurance policy for the leading state when its vital interests are affected, and states with substantial structural power may choose to trade <b>formal</b> <b>voting</b> rights for informal influence in order to induce participation by a wider range of states. Hybrid institutional forms involving both formal and informal governance mechanisms are the norm because they make it possible to accommodate the interests of both strong and weak powers. Informal governance can be legitimate because the degree of conflict of interest between the leading state and the membership varies over time, so the member countries tolerate a degree of informal influence in special cases in return for a larger share of decision making authority in ordinary times. This tacit contract depends upon the restraint of the leading state, however, and the legitimacy and credibility of the organization can be eroded if informal influence is used too frequently...|$|R

2500|$|As {{his later}} work proved, Morley {{was also a}} genuine scholar and {{archaeologist}} with an abiding interest in the region. However, his research activities in this period seem to have played a largely secondary role to his espionage duties. The authors of research into his spying proclaim Morley [...] "arguably the best secret agent the United States produced during World War I". [...] Shortly after the war several of Morley's contemporaries voiced their misgivings over the duplicitous nature of the espionage work that Morley {{and several of his}} colleagues had been suspected of. One notable critic, the famous anthropologist Franz Boas, published a letter of protest in the December 20, 1919 edition of The Nation. Without naming the suspected archaeologists, Boas' letter denounced these Central American operatives who had [...] "prostituted science by using it as a cover for their activities as spies". [...] Ten days after the letter was published, the American Anthropological Association censured Boas for this action in a 21-to-10 <b>formal</b> <b>vote</b> on a resolution distancing the AAA from Boas' views.

Churchill’s telegram also arrived that morning, agreeing to an armistice provided the French fleet was moved to British ports, a proposal unacceptable to Darlan, who argued that it would leave France defenceless. De Gaulle was in London for talks about the planned Franco-British Union that afternoon. He telephoned Reynaud to inform him the British Cabinet had agreed. The French Cabinet then met in Bordeaux. Reynaud wanted to fight on; he and Georges Mandel were among the few in the cabinet to support the proposal. Contrary to Lebrun’s mistaken recollection, no <b>formal</b> <b>vote</b> appears to have been taken at Cabinet on Sunday 16 June. The outcome of the meeting is unclear. Ten ministers wanted to fight on while seven favoured an armistice, though these included the two Deputy Prime Ministers: Pétain and Chautemps. An armistice was also favoured by Weygand. Another eight ministers were undecided, but ultimately swung towards an armistice. This time, Lebrun reluctantly accepted Reynaud’s resignation.
