25|$|A diving mask (also half mask, <b>dive</b> <b>mask</b> or scuba mask) is {{an item of}} diving {{equipment}} that allows underwater divers, including, scuba divers, free-divers, and snorkelers to see clearly underwater. Surface supplied divers usually use a full face mask or diving helmet, but in some systems the half mask may be used. When the human eye is {{in direct contact with}} water as opposed to air, its normal environment, light entering the eye is refracted by a different angle and the eye is unable to focus the light. By providing an air space in front of the eyes, light enters normally and the eye is able to focus correctly.|$|E
2500|$|While {{there are}} hazards {{specifically}} associated with solo diving, {{most of these}} can be planned for and their consequences mitigated {{by the use of}} appropriate equipment. In technical diving, where redundancy of critical equipment is standard policy, self-sufficiency is emphasised and taught more extensively than in recreational diving. This philosophy should also be followed by solo divers. A solo diver operating beyond the range for acceptable risk for a controlled emergency swimming ascent needs to carry a second, independent source of suitable breathing gas, which includes a regulator and preferably a submersible pressure gauge. This emergency gas supply typically {{takes the form of a}} pony bottle, or for more demanding diving, a twin tank set with the capability of independent operation of each tank. Additional equipment carried may include a backup dive computer, a backup dive light and a backup <b>dive</b> <b>mask.</b> The diver must be [...] familiar with the equipment configuration used and be able to access the equipment easily if it is needed. A solo diver needs to be particularly aware of overall personal fitness and health and the limitations it may impose on their ability to manage an emergency. Finally, the solo diver may dive a more conservative dive plan than he/she might dive with an equally competent buddy diver.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Swimming goggles {{increase}} the intraocular pressure (IOP) via the periorbital frame pressure and suction effect. In comparison, <b>diving</b> <b>masks</b> {{have a larger}} frame rim and incorporate the nose. The exact effect(s) of <b>diving</b> <b>masks</b> on IOP is unknown. This study evaluates the influence of <b>diving</b> <b>masks</b> on IOP in normal, healthy subjects. Methods: Tonometry was performed in both eyes of all subjects with an AVIA®Tono-Pen by a single investigator. Measurements were taken at baseline without the <b>diving</b> <b>mask</b> and with the subjects wearing a small-volume, double-window <b>diving</b> <b>mask,</b> but with the mask lenses removed. Two IOP readings in each eye were measured, and an additional reading was measured if {{the difference between the}} initial 2 was ≥ 2 mm Hg. Central corneal thickness (CCT) was also measured in each eye, using a contact pachymeter (OcuScan®Alcon). Results: Forty eyes of 20 healthy volunteers (age 29. 7 ± 9. 3 years; range 21 – 52) were included. The mean CCT was 544. 4 ± 43. 5 µm. The mean IOP before the <b>diving</b> <b>mask</b> was worn had been 17. 23 ± 2. 18 mm Hg (n = 40). The IOP decreased by 0. 43 mm Hg (p &#x 3 c; 0. 05) to 16. 80 ± 2. 57 mm Hg after the <b>diving</b> <b>mask</b> had been put on. There was no correlation between IOP change and age (r = 0. 143, p = 0. 337), gender (r = – 0. 174, p = 0. 283) or CCT (r = – 0. 123, p = 0. 445). Conclusion: There was no increase in IOP after the <b>diving</b> <b>mask</b> had been worn. A small but statistically significant decrease in IOP was observed. This study demonstrates that unlike swimming goggles, the strap tension and frame pressure on the periorbital tissue from a <b>diving</b> <b>mask</b> does not increase IOP. <b>Diving</b> <b>masks</b> may be a suitable alternative to swimming goggles for patients with advanced glaucoma or glaucoma filtration surgery...|$|R

It shows film crews wearing chain mail as protection whilst the cast perform in the water unprotected. The filming was made possible by the development of shark tourism in the Bahamas. The sharks are used to being hand fed and will not generally attack humans but as a result will grab any item that [...] "hits" [...] the water as potential food. In an early scene, Paul Walker has to grab two fins and a <b>dive</b> <b>mask</b> flung to him by Alba. During filming he missed the mask. It was never seen again after hitting the water and the DVD suggests that it was taken by a shark.|$|E
50|$|Night Diving is {{an event}} where a {{competitor}} wearing a blacked-out diving mask needs to find 3 items placed {{on the bottom of}} the swimming pool within 3 minutes. The competitor is provided with a drag rope of length no longer than 5m, a clip for tying up the rope and a bag to hold collected items. The competitor after donning the blacked-out <b>dive</b> <b>mask</b> is escorted on the surface by a judge to a basic shot line moored in the centre of the competition area. The competitor then descends to the pool bottom to commence searching. The 3 items are placed 4 metres apart and at distances of 2, 3 and 4 metres from the centre of the competition area. Competitors are ranked using a scoring system that gives points for the number of items collected and the collection of items in the quickest time.|$|E
