5000|$|In August 2017, Brown started prosecuting murder suspect Jason Marshall who {{was arrested}} after murder victim's {{relative}} found hidden footage of killing on his laptop.Peter Fasoli, 58 years old IT expert from Northolt was terrorised and murdered in 2013 at his own house by Marshall who posed as a policeman. On {{the opening day of}} his trial at the Old Bailey, Marshall was described as a [...] "calculated and determined" [...] killer. Prosecuting, Mr Brown warned jurors that they would be asked to view the video, which showed the actual killing itself. The court heard that during sexual roleplay, Marshall stripped the victim and arrested him for “being a spy” and hacking into a government laptop, the court heard. Fasoli was threatened with a knife and forced to hand over his cash card pin numbers, the court heard. Marshall subsequently set fire to Fasoli's home in attempt to make Fasoli's death look like an accident. [...] "The fire, {{in the early hours of}} January 7, 2013, had been intended to hide a terrible crime. The fire was set by this defendant in an attempt to disguise what truly happened, and the defendant Jason Marshall very nearly succeeded in escaping justice. Peter Fasoli was killed, intentionally. He had been subjected to a calculated and determined attack, by this defendant whom he invited into his home. In the end he literally fought for his life but by the time Mr Fasoli fully understood the true motives of the person who had tricked his way into his home, it was too late. Desperate as his attempts were, he could do nothing - as you will all too graphically come to understand. [...] " [...] — Edward Brown QC, Prosecutor. But two years later when Fasoli's nephew was sorting through his belongings, he was horrified to discover a computer <b>file</b> containing CCTV <b>footage</b> of the entire event.The court heard how Marshall, who denies murder, first got in contact with Mr Fasoli in December 2012 through gay social networking site called Badoo, inviting to set up a treesome and inventing the persona of a policeman.Prosecuting, Mr Brown told jurors: There is a telling feature of this case - whilst the defendant sought to tempt the deceased into thinking their encounter that night was to be sexual in nature, the sexual element of the night’s events played only a short part early on and soon was superseded by physical domination and then violence. The Old Baily heard that Marshall arrived at the Fasoli's home at around 7pm on January 6, 2012, pretending to be a police officer kitted out with a police utility belt, handcuffs and a pistol holster.During sexual role play, Marshall stripped the victim and arrested him for “being a spy” and hacking into a Government laptop, the court heard.After Marshall fled the scene, he sent a “calculated and cynical” message to Fasoli on the Badoo chat line apologising for not seeing him the night before. He allegedly withdrew £400 in cash from the Fasoli's bank account and used his card to buy a flight to Rome. In February 2016 Marshal was arrested in Italy and extradited to United Kingdom to face trial for murder of Fasoli he commited four years ago. A Metropolitan Police spokesman commented: [...] Detectives investigating the murder of a man in Northolt in 2013 have arrested and charged a man on suspicion of his murder. He will appear in custody at Hendon Magistrates' Court today. The investigation into Mr Fasoli's murder was started on 10 November 2014 by officers from the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, after new evidence was passed to the MPS. Mr Fasoli, aged 58, died on Monday, 7 January 2013 after he was brought out of his burning flat in Rubens Road, Northolt. The court has heard that Fasoli accidentally filmed his own bondage sex session murder at the hands of a fake policeman. Jurors at the Old Bailey watched footage of Fasoli begging for his life as he was attacked by fantasist Marshall while classical music played in the background. Camera footage showed Fasioli becoming visibly distressed as he was gagged and bound on his bed. He was threatened with a large hunting knife and forced to hand over his cash card pin numbers, the court heard. Prosecuting, Brown told the jury: [...] Fasoli's postmortem examination initially gave the cause of death as inhalation of fire fumes, but a re-examination found that Fasoli was still alive when the fire was set. Restraint and asphyxia also contributed to Fasoli's death.|$|R

Linder failed to match Chaplin's popularity in America. In a last-ditch effort to save the studio, Essanay joined in a four-way merger orchestrated by Chicago distributor George Kleine in 1918. Kleine's new combine, V-L-S-E, Incorporated, was an amalgam of the Vitagraph, Lubin, Selig, and Essanay companies. Only the Vitagraph brand name continued into the 1920s, and was absorbed by Warner Brothers in 1925.|$|E
5000|$|A {{short time}} after {{announcement}} of the polar expedition, some newspapers tried to stir up controversy by claiming the expedition was fake {{because some of the}} footage was from James Cameron's movie Titanic.

They had shown this hours before the Mir submersibles had arrived on the Arctic seabed, and they had pointed out that the footage was from the movie, not a transmission from the site. Reuters did not note this information when it carried the story, and used the pictures wrongly captioned.
