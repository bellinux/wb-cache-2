40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that a}} hexavalent group A streptococcal M protein-based vaccine evoked bactericidal antibodies after intramuscular injection. In the present study, we show that the <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> formulated with several different mucosal adjuvants and delivered intranasally induced serum and salivary antibodies that protected mice from intranasal challenge infections with virulent group A streptococci. The <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> was formulated with liposomes with or without monophosphorylated lipid A (MPL), cholera toxin B subunit with or without holotoxin, or proteosomes from Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane proteins complexed with lipopolysaccharide from Shigella flexneri. Intranasal immunization with the <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> mixed with these adjuvants resulted in significant levels of antibodies in serum 2 weeks after the final dose. Mean serum antibody titers were equivalent in all groups of mice except those that were immunized with hexavalent protein plus liposomes without MPL, which were significantly lower. Salivary antibodies were also detected in mice that received the vaccine formulated with the four strongest adjuvants. T-cell proliferative assays and cytokine assays using lymphocytes from cervical lymph nodes and spleens from mice immunized with the <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> formulated with proteosomes indicated the presence of hexavalent protein-specific T cells and a Th 1 -weighted mixed Th 1 -Th 2 cytokine profile. Intranasal immunization with adjuvanted formulations of the <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> resulted in significant levels of protection (80 to 100 %) following intranasal challenge infections with type 24 group A streptococci.

40|$|A <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> {{containing}} diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, whole cell pertussis, Haemophilius influenza type B, hepatitis B and inactivated {{polio vaccine}} (IPV) may: (i) increase {{the efficiency of}} vaccination campaigns, (ii) {{reduce the number of}} injections thereby reducing needlestick injuries, and (iii) ensure better protection against pertussis as compared to vaccines containing acellular pertussis antigens. An approach to obtain a <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> might be reconstituting lyophilized polio vaccine (IPV-LYO) with liquid pentavalent vaccine just before intramuscular delivery. The potential limitations of this approach were investigated including thermostability of IPV as measured by D-antigen ELISA and rat potency, the compatibility of fluid and lyophilized IPV in combination with thimerosal and thimerosal containing <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine.</b> The rat potency of polio type 3 in IPV-LYO was 2 to 3 -fold lower than standardized on the D-antigen content, suggesting an alteration of the polio type 3 D-antigen particle by lyophilization. Type 1 and 2 had unaffected antigenicity/immunogenicity ratios. Alteration of type 3 D-antigen could be detected by showing reduced thermostability at 45 °C compared to type 3 in non-lyophilized liquid controls. Reconstituting IPV-LYO in the presence of thimerosal (TM) resulted in a fast temperature dependent loss of polio type 1 - 3 D-antigen. The presence of 0. 005 % TM reduced the D-antigen content by ∼ 20 % (polio type 2 / 3) and ∼ 60 % (polio type 1) in 6 h at 25 °C, which are WHO open vial policy conditions. At 37 °C, D-antigen was diminished even faster, suggesting that very fast, i. e., immediately after preparation, intramuscular delivery of the conceived <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> would not be a feasible option.

40|$|AbstractBackground and aimsSimplified vaccine {{preparation}} steps {{would save}} time and reduce potential immunisation errors. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess vaccine preparation time with fully-liquid <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> (DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T, Sanofi Pasteur MSD) versus non-fully liquid <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> that needs reconstitution (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals). MethodsNinety-six Health Care Professionals (HCPs) participated in a randomised, cross-over, open-label, time and motion study in Belgium (2014). HCPs prepared each vaccine in a cross-over manner with a wash-out period of 3 – 5 min. An independent nurse assessed preparation time and immunisation errors by systematic review of the videos. HCPs satisfaction and preference were evaluated by a self-administered questionnaire. ResultsAverage preparation time was 36 s for the fully-liquid vaccine and 70. 5 s for the non-fully liquid vaccine. The time saved using the fully-liquid vaccine was 34. 5 s (p≤ 0. 001). On 192 preparations, 57 immunisation errors occurred: 47 in the non-fully liquid vaccine group (including one missing reconstitution of Hib component), 10 in the fully-liquid vaccine group. 71. 9 % of HCPs were very or somewhat satisfied with the ease of handling of both vaccines; 66. 7 % and 67. 7 % were very or somewhat satisfied with speed of preparation in the fully-liquid vaccine and the non-fully liquid vaccine groups, respectively. Almost all HCPs (97. 6 %) stated they would prefer the use of the fully-liquid vaccine in their daily practice. ConclusionsPreparation of a fully-liquid <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> can be completed in half the time necessary to prepare a non-fully liquid vaccine. The simplicity of the fully-liquid <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> preparation helps optimise reduction of immunisation errors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In 2001, two <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccines</b> were {{licensed}} in Italy (Hexavac ®, Infanrix Hexa ®), {{and since}} 2002 were extensively used for primary immunization {{in the first}} year of life (at 3, 5, 11 / 12 months of age). In 2005, the market authorization of Hexavac ® was precautionary suspended by EMEA, because of doubts on long-term protection against hepatitis B virus. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the persistence of antibodies to anti-HBs, in children in the third year of life, and to investigate the response to a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Methods Participant children were enrolled concomitantly with the offering of anti-polio booster dose, in the third year of life. Anti-HBs titers were determined on capillary blood samples. A booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine was administered to children with anti-HBs titers Results Sera from 113 children previously vaccinated with Hexavac ®, and from 124 vaccinated with Infanrix Hexa ® were tested for anti-HBs. Titers were ≥ 10 mIU/ml in 69 % and 96 % (p Post-booster, 93 % of children achieved titers ≥ 10 mIU/ml, with no significant difference by vaccine group. Discussion Fifteen months after third dose administration, a significant difference in anti-HBs titers was noted in the two vaccine groups considered. Monovalent hepatitis B vaccine administration in 3 -year old children induced a proper booster response, confirming that immunologic memory persists in children with anti-HBs titers < 10 mIU/ml.

A new, fully liquid combined <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> has been introduced and {{has been shown to}} reduce administration time. This fully liquid vaccine may also be simpler to administer and could reduce handling errors. The present study was designed to understand the value that health care providers (HCPs) place on aspects of injection devices for combined <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> programs in Germany. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was designed to elicit the views of HCPs regarding hexavalent vaccines. The key attributes of injection devices were identified through a focused literature search and interviews with HCPs. Five key attributes, each with two or three levels were described which included: type of device, experience of this <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> on the German market, preparation time, probability of handling errors, and dosage errors. Physicians (n= 150) and nurses (n= 150) who administered hexavalent vaccines in Germany completed the survey. Choice data were analyzed using the conditional logit procedure. All attributes were significant and important independent influences on physicians’ and nurses’ choices. Reducing any “probability of dosage errors” was the most important attribute. Both physicians and nurses had a strong preference to reduce preparation time. All other things equal both groups also significantly preferred a fully liquid <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine.</b> They also preferred vaccines that had been on the market for a few years compared to ones that had not (especially the physicians). Additional analyses explored participants’ preferences in more detail through interaction terms. The DCE choice data provide useful insights into how HCPs view each aspect of the vaccination device. Overall, the HCPs preferred fully liquid vaccines. The survey also highlighted the importance of handling and dosage errors, reducing preparation time, and also experience of the HCPs {{with the use of a}} vaccine.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{childhood}} vaccination against hepatitis B relies on persistence of immunity into adolescence and adulthood.

Hexavac was withdrawn in 2005 amidst concerns about its long-term hepatitis B protection. We compared hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) levels in children fully vaccinated with Hexavac or Infanrix hexa (n= 477) in a secondary data analysis of a large cross-sectional health survey in Germany. On average 2 · 4 years after vaccination, 25 · 3 % of Hexavac vaccinees had anti-HBs levels < 10 mIU/ml (95 % CI 19 · 0 – 32 · 8) compared to 4 · 7 % of Infanrix hexa vaccinees (95 % CI 2 · 4 – 8 · 9).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: The {{immunization}} schedule {{might be}} continuously updated {{on the basis}} of the new scientific and epidemiological knowledge, possible changes in operational requirements and the availability of new products. A high vaccination compliance is strictly related to factors such as tolerability, effectiveness and number of injections. This last has always been a critical point and combined vaccines guarantee high levels of safety and immunogenicity requiring fewer injections and accesses to services. Co-administration should be considered in order to expand the supply of important vaccinations, (eg. meningococcal and pneumococcal), avoiding the increase of the number of accesses to services. METHODS: Since January 2007, an experience with the co-administration of <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> together with conjugate pneumococcal and meningococcal C vaccines started at the LHU CN 1 -Ambito di Cuneo. The target of this co-administration, based on scientific criteria, is to provide immunization against St. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis in newborns. RESULTS: Considering that the coverage rate (VC%) with <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> has been always high and that, at the end of 2006, the VC% for the pneumococcal and meningococcal C conjugate vaccines were equal to 50. 4 % and 44. 4 %, in this first year of experience the compliance to co-administration has significantly increased from 47 % of doses administered in the first quarter of 2007 to 65 % in the first quarter of 2008.

The {{participants in this study}} were immunised in 1995 - 1996 with hexavalent MenB vesicle vaccine or with hepatitis B vaccine (control group). The booster vaccination with MonoMen was well tolerated. No serious adverse events occurred during the study. Most systemic adverse reactions were observed during day 2 and 3. Local reactions, which generally lasted for three days, were more common than systemic reactions. The rise of the GMT of bactericidal antibodies against P 1. 7 h, 4 in children primed with MenB was much higher as compared to children who received the HepB vaccine. About 80 % of the children with an immune response after the primary series with the <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine,</b> also showed an immune response after the booster vaccination with MonoMen which indicates the presence of an immunological memory for these children.

Seropositivity and booster response rates against all antigens were 97. 4 - 100 %. Reactogenicity following booster vaccination with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib was similar regardless of the primary regimen used. Three to four years after administration of the 4 th DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib dose, < 90 % vaccinees had persistent protective antibody concentrations against diphtheria, hepatitis B, Hib and the three poliovirus types.

Part of the enrolled children received only primary vaccination, while others had the pre-school boost dose. A similar level of antigen-specific IgG and ASC was found in Infanrix and Hexavac vaccinated children. The mean IgG levels were significantly higher in children that received the pre-school boost as compared with children that did not receive the boost dose. A longer persistence after the pre-school boost of IgG-Pertussis Toxin (PT) and IgG-pertactin levels was observed in Infanrix primed children, but it was not statistically significant. More than 80 % of children presented a positive ASC B memory response. Around 50 % of children still presented protective IgG-PT levels which are reduced to 36 % in no-boosted children. The pre-school booster dose restores the percentage of protected children above 50 %.

40|$|Abstract Background Medical {{and public}} health {{importance}} of pneumococcal infections justifies the implementation of measures capable of reducing their incidence and severity, and explains why the recently marketed heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV- 7) has been widely studied by pediatricians. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the impact of PCV- 7 administered at 3, 5 and 11 months of age on respiratory tract infections in very young children. Methods A total of 1, 571 healthy infants (910 males) aged 75 – 105 days (median 82 days) were enrolled in this prospective cohort trial to receive a <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> (DTaP/IPV/HBV/Hib) and PCV- 7 (n = 819) or the <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> alone (n = 752) at 3, 5 and 11 months of age. Morbidity was recorded for the 24 months following the second dose by monthly telephone interviews conducted by investigators blinded to the study treatment assignment using standardised questionnaires. During these interviews, the caregivers and the children's pediatricians were questioned about illnesses and the use of antibiotics since the previous telephone call. All of the data were analysed using SAS Windows v. 12. Results Among the 1, 555 subjects (98. 9 %) who completed the study, analysis of the data by the periods of follow-up demonstrated that radiologically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was significantly less frequent in the PCV- 7 group during the follow-up as a whole and during the last period of follow-up. Moreover, there were statistically significant between-group differences in the incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) in each half-year period of follow-up except the first, with significantly lower number of episodes in children receiving PCV- 7 than in controls. Furthermore, the antibiotic prescription data showed that the probability of receiving an antibiotic course was significantly lower in the PCV- 7 group than in the control group. Conclusion Our findings show the effectiveness of the simplified PCV- 7 schedule (three doses administered at 3, 5 and 11 – 12 months of age) in the prevention of CAP and AOM, diseases in which Streptococcus pneumoniae plays a major etiological role. A further benefit is that the use of PCV- 7 reduces the number of antibiotic prescriptions. All of these advantages may also be important from an economic point of view. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In two {{clinical}} trials, {{low-grade fever}} was observed more frequently after coadministration than after separate administration of two recommended routine pediatric vaccines. Since fever {{is an important}} issue with vaccine tolerability, we performed this open-label study on the efficacy and safety of prophylactic use of paracetamol (acetaminophen, Benuron(R)) in children administered routine 7 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV- 7) coadministered with <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-hepatitis B, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine [DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib]) in Germany. METHODS: Healthy infants (N = 301) who received a 3 -dose infant series of PCV- 7 and DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib plus a toddler dose were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to prophylactic paracetamol (125 mg or 250 mg suppositories, based on body weight) at vaccination, and at 6 [...] 8 hour intervals thereafter, or a control group that received no paracetamol. Rectal temperature and local and other systemic reactions were measured for 4 days post vaccination; adverse events were collected throughout the study. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat population, paracetamol reduced the incidence of fever >= 38 [degree sign]C, but this reduction was only significant for the infant series, with computed efficacy of 43. 0...|$|E

This study {{assessed}} the booster immune {{response to a}} pentavalent combi-nation vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliovi-rus, and conjugated-Hib polysaccharide antigens, (DTaP-IPV//PRP~T, PentaximTM, an AcXim family vaccine) at 18 - 24 months of age. Study subjects received a three-dose primary vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 months with a <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> containing the same antigens plus recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen. Antibody concentrations were measured immediately before and one month after vaccination. Reactogenicity and safety were evaluated from parent reports. Before the booster dose, 92. 9 % of the 156 children {{included in this study}} still had anti-PRP antibody titers ≥ 0. 15 µg/ml. Seroprotective concentrations of anti-diphtheria, tetanus and poliovirus antibodies were maintained in 97 to 100 % of subjects in the interval between primary and booster vaccination. One month after the booster dose, all subjects had seroprotective anti-PRP (≥ 1 µg/ml), diphtheria and tetanus (≥ 0. 1 IU/ml) and poliovirus types 1, 2, 3 (≥ 8 1 /dil) antibody levels.

Two concentrations of the MenB vesicle were investigated where hepatitis B vaccine (HB-VAX(registered trademark) DNA) was used as a control and administered according to the same schedule as the RIVM MenB vaccine. The vaccination schedule was based on 3 doses given at 0, 2 and 8 months. The meningococcal vaccine was found to be more reactogenic than the control vaccine but the reactions were mild, no serious reactions occurred. Fever, {{one of the most common}} systemic adverse reactions after vaccination, did not occur more often after administration of the MenB vesicle vaccines than after administration of the control vaccine. The serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) response was assessed against isogenic variants of strain H 44 / 76 in which each vaccine PorA protein was expressed individually. In the blood samples obtained one month after vaccination, toddlers (aged 2 - 3) were shown to have statistically significant higher SBA titres than school children (aged 7 - 8). There was no significant difference between the low and high vaccine doses. The SBA response was directed predominantly at one of the three PorA proteins in each of the two vesicles. The RIVM <b>hexavalent</b> MenB vesicle <b>vaccine</b> will be further improved, both with regard to both production methods and to immunogenicity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Few {{studies have}} {{assessed}} long term persisting immunity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in children vaccinated during infancy with combined vaccines containing recombinant HBV surface antigen (HBs). We assessed antibody persistence and immune memory in children 4 - 5 years of age, previously vaccinated with four doses of combined <b>hexavalent</b> DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib <b>vaccine</b> (Infanrix hexa ™). Methods Immune memory was assessed in 301 children through administration {{of a challenge}} dose of monovalent HBV vaccine. Results At 4 - 5 years of age, 85. 3 % of subjects had persisting anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/mL, rising to 98. 6 % after the HBV challenge dose. All but 12 subjects (95. 8 %) achieved post-challenge anti-HBs concentrations ≥ 100 mIU/mL. The post-challenge anti-HBs GMC rose by 100 -fold compared to pre-challenge concentrations. An anamnestic response to the HBV vaccine challenge was observed in 96. 8 % of subjects, including 17 / 21 (81. 0 %) of children with initially undetectable antibodies (Conclusion The combined DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine induced lasting immune memory against hepatitis B.

A range of schedules are recommended for hepatitis B vaccination of premature infants. This open-label study (217744 / 083) compared the immune response of premature (N = 94) and full-term infants (N = 92) to hepatitis B antigen following primary administration of <b>hexavalent</b> DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib <b>vaccine</b> at 2 – 4 – 6 months and a booster dose at 18 months. Anti-HBsAg antibodies were determined before and one month after primary and booster doses. There {{were no significant differences}} in postprimary seroprotection rates (anti-HBsAg> 10 mIU/mL; preterm 93. 4 %; full-term 95. 2 %) or geometric mean concentrations (634 versus 867 mIU/ml), and neither appeared to be related to gestational length or birth weight. Prebooster seroprotection rates were 75 and 80. 6 %, respectively. Six premature infants did not respond to primary and booster doses. Primary and booster vaccinations with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib elicit satisfactory anti-HBsAg responses in preterm infants, which are not influenced by gestational age or birth weight.

40|$|Methods and Objectives. To {{estimate}} infant {{vaccination coverage}} in the French-speaking region of Belgium (Wallonia) and in the Brussels-Capital Region, two cross-sectional studies were performed in 2012. A face-to-face questionnaire was administered by trained investigators. The objective was to evaluate infant vaccination coverage retrospectively in 18 - to 24 -month-old children. These studies offered the opportunity to assess some factors influencing vaccine uptake in infants. Results and Discussion. Approximately 99 % of the children had received the first dose of IPV-DTaP, 90 % the fourth dose, 94 % the MMR vaccine, 97 % the first dose of pneumococcal vaccine, and 90 % the third dose. In both regions, when fitting a logistic model, the most associated factor was attendance at maternal and child clinics (MCH). No association was observed between vaccination coverage and the mother’s level of education. For the last immunization session, where the mother was a Belgian native and when she worked more hours, child was better immunized, but only in Brussels. Conclusion. Coverage for the fourth dose of <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> (DTaP-IPV-HBV/Hib) needs to be increased. Indeed, additional effort is needed to increase HIB and pertussis coverage rates because the herd immunity threshold for these two diseases has not been reached...|$|E

40|$|The global {{cost of a}} {{vaccination}} program is made up by many more cost components than the acquisition expense, although the former is the first cost usually taken into consideration when comparing two or more alternatives. The present article analyses the economical impact consequent {{to the use of}} two different <b>hexavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> formulations (Hexavac, liquid ready for injection, and Infanrix Hexa, dry, to be re-hydrated) available on the Italian market for the mandatory vaccination of newborns during their first year of life. The cost minimization analysis was conducted considering only differential costs, i. e. those costs than can differ with the use of one of the two products, and not those common to the two competing products, such as acquisition cost (33 euro in average for both), the costs for the organization, the call of the infants to be vaccinated, etc [...] The differences among the considered alternatives detected by this study regard the work for the preparation and administration of the vaccines, the quantity of special waste they produce and the incidence of serious febrile reactions leading to pharmacological treatment and physician consultation (body temperature > 40 °C). The liquid formulation resulted more convenient in terms of cost for nurse work (0, 63 euro saved per patient), waste disposal, and adverse reactions management. The robustness of these results was confirmed by sensitivity analysis and an estimate of the global saving for the Italian health system associated with the universal utilization of the liquid formulation is furnished...|$|E
40|$|This report {{gives the}} results of a {{randomised}} phase-II clinical study into the safety and immunogenicity of a monovalent MenB OMV vaccine expressing P 1. 7 h, 4 PorA (MonoMen) in toddlers. Safety and immunogenicity are compared for two types of vaccine that are differently adjuvated (either aluminium phosphate or aluminium hydroxide). MonoMen is administred a 3 - or 4 -dose schedule with vaccinations at 0, 2 and 8 or 0, 1, 2 and 8 months. A total of 134 children were included in the study. No serious adverse events occurred during the study. Only mild local and systemic reactions were reported during the observation period. None of the children showed bactericidal activity against the PorA negative mutant strain H 1. 5, illustrating PorA specificity of the antibody response. In general, the SBA response was highest in the AlPO 4 groups, which means that adsorption of the RIVM meningococcal vaccines to AlPO 4 seems preferable to Al(OH) 3. After the primary series slightly higher titres were found in children who received two vaccinations instead of three, which is probably due to the longer intervals between the vaccinations in the 2 + 1 -schedule. After the booster vaccination significantly higher GMT's were found in children vaccinated according to the 3 + 1 -schedule. Even though the 3 + 1 -schedule seems better with respect to GMT's, the percentages of immune responders showed only minor differences between the two schedules. Both this study and the study concerning the booster effect of MonoMen in children primed with a <b>hexavalent</b> MenB <b>vaccine</b> showed that MonoMen is a safe and immunogenic vaccine...|$|R
40|$|A set of {{isogenic}} strains {{was constructed}} from the meningococcal reference strain H 44 / 76 (B: 15 :P 1. 7, 16) which differed {{only in their}} outer membrane protein (OMP) compositions. First, three isogenic strains lacking the expression of either class 3 (PorB) or class 4 (RmpM) OMP or both were obtained. Second, three isogenic class 1 OMP loop-deficient strains of H 44 / 76 lacking the predicted loop 1 or 4 or both of class 1 OMP (PorA) were obtained. Third, three isogenic class 1 OMP strains which differed by point mutations in the predicted loop 4 of subtype P 1. 16 were constructed. Strains were constructed through transformation with gene constructs made in Escherichia coli and their homologous recombination into the meningococcal chromosome. This study describes the contribution {{of one of the}} six class 1 OMPs, PorA P 1. 7, 16, in the development of bactericidal antibodies after a single immunization of adult volunteers with 50 or 100 micrograms of protein within a hexavalent PorA outer membrane vesicle vaccine. PorA-, PorB-, and RpmM-deficient isogenic strains were used to define the human immune response against PorA. The loop-deficient isogenic strains were used to define the contribution of loops 1 and 4 of PorA in the development of bactericidal anti-PorA antibodies. The isogenic strains carrying a point mutation in loop 4 were used to study the cross-reactivity of the induced bactericidal antibodies against target strains showing microheterogeneity. The results indicate that a single immunization with the <b>hexavalent</b> PorA <b>vaccine</b> induced a dose-dependent bactericidal immune response, which is directed mainly against PorA. The epitope specificity of antibodies is directed mostly against loop 1, although loop 4 and as-yet-unidentified epitopes of PorA P 1. 7, 16 are also involved...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Administration of two {{doses of}} {{hepatitis}} A (HA) vaccine to children > or = 2 {{years of age}} {{has been shown to}} be protective. The present study assessed whether HA vaccine can be administered as early as 6 months of age and whether it can be administered concomitantly with a <b>hexavalent</b> (HV) <b>vaccine</b> at this age. METHODS: In an open label, randomized, parallel group study, the liquid HV vaccine (HEXAVAC) (diphtheria, tetanus, 2 -component acellular pertussis, inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugated to tetanus protein and hepatitis B) was administered at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age to all children. HA vaccine (VAQTA) was given at 7 and 13 months in the separate administration group (Group 1) and at 6 and 12 months in the concomitant administration group (Group 2). Serum samples were obtained at 2, 7, 12, and 14 months in Group 1 and at 2, 7, 12, and 13 months in Group 2. The primary immunogenicity outcomes were the seroconversion rates for HA 1 month after the second dose of HA vaccine in initially seronegative subjects, and the seroconversion rates for each HV antigen 1 month after the third dose of the HV vaccine (both at 7 months of age). RESULTS: HA seropositivity rates 1 month after the second dose were 100 % in both groups, regardless of initial serostatus. The responses to each HV antigen 1 month after the third dose were similar in both groups. The vaccines were generally well tolerated in both groups regardless of vaccine(s) administered. CONCLUSIONS: A schedule of two doses of HA vaccine, 6 months apart beginning at 6 months of age is highly immunogenic and well tolerated when administered alone or concomitantly with HV vaccine at 6 and 12 months of age. status: publishe...|$|R
