40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Strategic Insights (August 2002), v. 1 no. 6 As {{a consequence of}} its operations in Afghanistan, the United States has found itself holding several hundred Taliban and al-Qaida prisoners whom it has identified as <b>illegal</b> <b>combatants.</b> Similar status has also been ascribed {{to at least one}} American citizen, arrested by civil authorities, who is suspected of being part of the al-Qaida terrorist organization, and who is being treated, for the time being at least, as a subject of military justice. The classification of prisoners taken in Afghanistan as <b>illegal</b> <b>combatants</b> immediately attracted much scrutiny, in part because international law provides no precise definition of what such a categorization implies, and in part because its use in the present instance was intended to deprive Taliban and al-Qaida fighters of the protections afforded prisoners of war under the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Although United States officials have routinely referred to the struggle against terrorism as a war, that characterization is, to all appearances, not acceptable when applied to the conduct of those on the other side...|$|R
50|$|The Hague and Geneva Conventions did not {{consider}} non-national actors as belligerents in general war.

Because of that, critics describe the MCA as an amnesty law for crimes committed in the War on Terror.|$|R

50|$|Soldiers who {{are wearing}} uniforms of the {{opposing}} army {{after the start of}} combat may be considered <b>illegal</b> <b>combatants</b> and subject to summary execution. Many armies have performed this kind of false flag ruse in the past, including both German and U.S. special forces during World War II. However, if soldiers remove their disguises and put on proper insignia before the start of combat in such an operation, they are considered legal combatants and must be treated as prisoners-of-war if captured. This distinction was settled by a military tribunal in the post-World War II trial of Otto Skorzeny, who led Operation Greif, an infiltration mission in which German commandos wore U.S. uniforms to infiltrate U.S. lines during the Battle of the Bulge.|$|R

The sentence was demanded by the prosecutor Hans Giesecke and declared by presiding judge Kurt Bode, Vice-President of the Oberlandesgericht Danzig (Higher Regional Court of Danzig). 28 of the judgements were countersigned, and thus became legally valid, by General Hans Günther von Kluge, the further 10 by Colonel Eduard Wagner, who later committed suicide on 23 July 1944 {{as a member of the}} 20 July plot.A clemency appeal was rejected by General Walther von Brauchitsch.
