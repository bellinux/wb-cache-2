It seeks to show how physicians {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries in Colombia associate a clinical semiology of <b>disfiguring</b> disease with the influence of certain climatic and hereditary conditions. Characterizing <b>disfiguring</b> disease associated with climate implies revising the way in which, at the close of the nineteenth century, medical discourse constructed etiological explanations using the applied rationalism of the period.
