When it failed to provide a cargo manifest, Cuban {{officials}} seized the ship, its cargo, and <b>its</b> <b>crew.</b> The so-called Black Warrior Affair was viewed by Congress {{as a violation of}} American rights; a hollow ultimatum issued by Soul√© to the Spanish to return the ship served only to strain relations, and he was barred from discussing Cuba's acquisition for nearly a year. While the matter was resolved peacefully, it fueled the flames of Southern expansionism.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{veterans}} groups {{engaged in}} a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context.

Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.

The turuma had a bigger draft, was somewhat slower under oars, but offered superior accommodation for <b>its</b> <b>crew,</b> was more seaworthy and had roughly ten times the number of heavy guns. It could be propelled with either sails or oars and was both smaller and more manoeuvrable than most sailing warships which made it suitable for operations in shallow, confined waters.|$|E

5|$|The {{investigation}} is completed, and Remmick informs both Picard and Quinn {{that there is}} no sign of wrongdoing, and expresses his interest in joining <b>its</b> <b>crew</b> in the future. Quinn tells Picard that he feels there is an unknown force that has infiltrated Starfleet, and he was seeking to assure himself of his trust in Picard and the Enterprise crew. To help combat this threat, Quinn offers Picard a promotion to Admiral and a job overseeing Starfleet Academy which would place Picard near Quinn at all times. Picard mulls the offer for some time, but eventually declines.|$|E
25|$|The TS-1 was {{not universally}} liked by <b>its</b> <b>crews.</b> Positioning {{of the lower}} wing below the {{fuselage}} resulted in short wheel struts. This, and the wheel's placement {{close to each other}} caused considerable problems with ground looping.|$|R
