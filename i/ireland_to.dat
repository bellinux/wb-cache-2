5|$|Ireland was {{important}} to Henry, both {{as a source of}} royal revenue – an average of £1,150 was sent from <b>Ireland</b> <b>to</b> the Crown each year during the middle of his reign – and as a source of estates that could be granted to his supporters. The major landowners looked eastwards towards Henry's court for political leadership, and many also possessed estates in Wales and England. The 1240s saw major upheavals in land ownership due to deaths among the barons, enabling Henry to redistribute Irish lands to his supporters. In the 1250s, the King gave out numerous grants of land along the frontier in <b>Ireland</b> <b>to</b> his supporters, creating a buffer zone against the native Irish; the local Irish kings began to suffer increased harassment as English power increased across the region. These lands were in many cases unprofitable for the barons to hold and English power reached its zenith under Henry for the medieval period. In 1254, Henry granted <b>Ireland</b> <b>to</b> his son, Edward, on condition that it would never be separated from the Crown.|$|E

5|$|Although the British {{authorities}} had prohibited the American Neo-Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell {{from entering the}} UK, the NSM managed to smuggle him in via <b>Ireland</b> <b>to</b> attend a summer camp in August 1962.

Among those in attendance were the Neo-Nazi Savitri Devi and the former SS officer Fred Borth.|$|E
5|$|By 1541, King Henry VIII of England {{had broken}} with the Church of Rome and {{declared}} himself Supreme Head of the Church of England. The pope's grant of <b>Ireland</b> <b>to</b> the English monarch became invalid, so Henry summoned {{a meeting of}} the Irish Parliament to change his title from Lord of <b>Ireland</b> <b>to</b> King of Ireland. However much of the island was beyond English control, resulting in the extended Tudor conquest of Ireland that only made the Kingdom of Ireland a reality in 1603, {{at the conclusion of the}} Nine Years' War (Ireland). Nevertheless, Ireland retained its own parliament, becoming an independent state in 1642-1649 (Confederate Ireland), and again in 1688-91. Only warfare such as the Williamite War in Ireland and subsequent occupation enabled the English crown from 1692, and successive British states from 1707, to retain the country.|$|E

5|$|In March 1460 Warwick visited York in <b>Ireland</b> <b>to</b> {{plan the}} way ahead, and {{returned}} to Calais.

Salisbury was left to besiege the Tower of London, while Warwick took March with him {{in pursuit of the}} king. At Northampton, on 10July, King Henry was taken captive, while the Duke of Buckingham and others were killed in battle.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{the high}} level of bog being {{destroyed}} by cutting has raised environmental concerns.

5|$|Northern Ireland itself was, {{for many}} years, {{the site of}} a violent and bitter ethno-sectarian conflict—The Troubles—between those {{claiming}} to represent Irish nationalism, who are predominantly Roman Catholic, and those claiming to represent British unionism, who are predominantly Protestant.

5|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{examples}} of Palladianism in Ireland is the Castletown House, near Dublin.

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is {{the most}} widespread member of its genus, breeding in temperate woodlands across Eurasia from <b>Ireland</b> <b>to</b> Japan. It prefers mature trees, and in most of Europe, where it shares its range with short-toed treecreeper, {{it tends to be}} found mainly in coniferous forest, especially spruce and fir. However, where it is the only treecreeper, as in European Russia, or the British Isles, it frequents broadleaved or mixed woodland in preference to conifers.|$|E
5|$|The deaths led {{to public}} {{mourning}} and {{protests against the}} Provisional IRA.

The British Army raised the minimum age needed to serve in Northern <b>Ireland</b> <b>to</b> 18 in response to this incident.
