40|$|The European Food Safety Authority marks a {{new stage}} in European Union governance. It has no direct {{regulatory}} powers, but is entrusted with developing norms of food safety, which are to inform the material content of EC food law. The hope is that its independence and expertise will restore popular confidence both in the EU and in the food we eat. The irreducible nature of lay-expert conflicts about hazard suggests that a more likely scenario is that such disputes become recast as opposition to EC law. Such conflict {{is most likely to}} manifest itself in national courts through challenges to or non-compliance with EC law. The current principles for resolution of such conflicts are hopelessly outmoded. The article, therefore, argues for a constitutional resettlement, which sets out principles germane {{to the nature of the}} EC regime, namely that of a multi-level regulatory State. It argues for a new defence of regulatory balance. Individuals could argue for the disapplication of EC norms where these violated a valued local regime which had given consideration to the issues raised in the <b>EC</b> <b>legislation</b> and whose positive value to its subjects exceeded its negative impact on the interests protected by the <b>EC</b> <b>legislation...</b>|$|E

By consolidating the emerging alternative dispute resolution systems, the policy brief proposes a new model to both enable consumers to effectively enforce their rights, and to help identify problems and prevent them from becoming mass issues. The recommendations cover issues such as independence; the acceptability of funding from business; whether decisions should be binding or not; the need for simplicity and clarity to engender consumer and business trust; and the need for transparency of aggregated data if the regulatory and behavioural benefits of the CADR system are to be achieved. </p...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the impact of}} the infringement action under Art. 228 (2) of the EC Treaty in assisting in the enforcement of EC environmental law. Its entry into force in November 1993 introduced {{for the first time in}} EC law the possibility of financial sanctions being imposed on EU Member States by the European Court of Justice over persistent failures on their part to adhere to Community law. One might have thought that Member State performance on implementing <b>EC</b> environmental <b>legislation</b> would have improved as a result, the threat of substantial financial sanctions serving as an effective deterrent against non-compliant state behaviour. However, experience has indicated that any initial optimism in the new infringement procedure has been misplaced in this regard. The evidence suggests that in many instances Member States have not been deterred continuing to delay or obstruct the correct implementation of EC environmental obligations into national law and practice. In analysing the evolution of law and practice of the procedure and in particular its impact on litigation over breaches of environmental law over the last decade, this article questions whether the penalty infringement procedure under Art. 228 (2) has proved itself fit for purpose...|$|R

40|$|This Essay {{points out}} the major legal {{issues related to the}} {{development}} of the Computerized Reservation Systems (“CRS”) and evaluates whether the EC approach has achieved satisfactory results, mainly from the standpoint of consumer protection. My critique is essentially that the EC has ruled the CRS by means of legislation that tends to be hyper-technical, difficult to interpret, and, at the same time, extremely vague when it comes to defining unlawful conduct and potential sanctions. This Essay argues that more in-depth regulatory reform should be undertaken by the EC, in order to enhance competition and benefit travellers. This Essay is structured in two conceptually interdependent sections. Part I focuses on a synthetic description of CRS and evaluates its potential to adversely impact a market based on free competition, specifically by violating the antitrust rules of the Treaty of Rome (“EEC Treaty”). Part II is devoted to an analysis of the most recent EC regulations in this area, with particular reference to Commission Regulation No. 83 / 91 of December 5, 1990. Regulation No. 83 / 91 gives a basic description of the CRS system within the framework of <b>EC</b> <b>legislation.</b> The minimal action undertaken thus far by the EC has been guided by two considerations. First, the area of Computerized Reservation Systems is still legally unstable and is characterized by gray areas and gaps in the rules that should be resolved by future <b>EC</b> <b>legislation.</b> Second, in the absence of a line of judicial precedents within the EC, a theoretical debate appears fruitless in light of the lack of a substantially consolidated position within the EC...|$|E
40|$|This study {{traces the}} {{development}} of the recently adopted packaging waste directive in order to illuminate the role of various actors in the integration process. While some of the findings about agenda-setting and qualified majority voting presented in this study apply directly to the sector of environmental policy, or specifically to the chosen case, the broader conclusions suggest the need for additional case studies of <b>EC</b> <b>legislation</b> and offer a theoretical framework in which these studies may be used to test competing notions of European integration. To this end, the study uses lessons from the case of packaging waste to refine the ongoing debate between scholars who propose state-centric models and those who advocate a view of Europe in which power is diffused to supranational institutions at the expense of state sovereignty.

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for clean water {{has led to the}} {{adoption}} of the EU Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000 / 60 <b>EC).</b> New <b>legislation</b> has a major impact on the water management and the national economy and provides numerous requirements, including "good status" of all water bodies. The Framework Directive also implies the need for an economic analysis of the optimal process to achieve good status by using the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). The application of this method in water management is struggling with a number of methodological complications. One of the affected areas in the Czech Republic is the catchment of the Orlik Reservoir that faces excessive eutrophication. Eutrophication is caused by excessive introduction of phosphorus. The main sources of phosphorus are municipal wastewater, aquaculture and agriculture. As illustrated by professional research mentioned in this work and the actual processing of CEA of the catchment of the Orlik Reservoir, a wide range of methodological problems can be avoided by using appropriate tools. This thesis also presents that achieving of good status of the catchment would require annual cost of CZK 602 million. The most significant cost bearers are according to the CEA fisheries and municipalities...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory {{policy is}} {{presently}} the principal form of European Community (<b>EC)</b> social policy <b>legislation</b> affecting European citizens. One possible explanation {{of this trend}} is that the Commission, {{far from being a}} neutral bureaucracy, has been an active force in pushing outward the frontiers of Community social policy. Expanding its skills, and learning from past experience, the Commission makes maximum use of its limited powers in the social sphere. One important aspect of the Commision's opportunistic role may be its ability to prepare the ground for future regulatory action. The relatively costless nature of regulatory policy-making, {{from the point of view}} of the Commission's budget, increasingly allows the Commission to call the proverbial tune without incurring the costs of paying the piper...|$|R
40|$|In practice, {{apart from}} the problem of vehicle routing, schedulers also face the problem of nding {{feasible}} driver schedules complying with complex restrictions on drivers' driving and working hours. To address this complex interdependent problem of vehicle routing and break scheduling, we propose a dynamic programming approach for the vehicle routing problem with time windows including the <b>EC</b> social <b>legislation</b> on drivers' driving and working hours. Our algorithm includes all optional rules in these legislations, which are generally ignored in the literature. To include the legislation in the dynamic programming algorithm we propose a break scheduling method that does not increase the time-complexity of the algorithm. This is a remarkable eect that generally does not hold for local search methods, which {{have proved to be}} very successful in solving less restricted vehicle routing problems. Computational results show that our method finds solutions to benchmark instances with 18 % less vehicles and 5 % less travel distance than state of the art approaches. Furthermore, they show that including all optional rules of the legislation leads to an additional reduction of 4 % in the number of vehicles and of 1. 5 % regarding the travel distance. Therefore, the optional rules should be exploited in practice...|$|R

40|$|National parliaments are {{commonly}} held to have 'failed' in {{their dealings with}} European institutions and in their impact upon the Community's legislative process. This article provides a 'revisionist' analysis to challenge this 'orthodoxy'. First, national parliaments have provided the legitimating frame within which {{the development of the}} European Community has been able to take place. Second, there has been no absolute, inexorable decline in the influence exerted by national parliaments in the EC policy process. If anything, events since the signing of the Treaty on European Union in December 1991 suggest that national parliaments have bargained increased powers of scrutiny over <b>EC</b> <b>legislation.</b> Third, it needs to be noted that there is a 'dual democratic deficit' within the European Union. The problem of the 'democratic deficit' is evident not solely in the accretion of decision-making power at the European level, but also in the fact that national parliaments within their own states exert limited control over their own national executives...|$|E
40|$|Questions {{regarding}} {{oil spills}} remain {{high on the}} political agenda. Legal scholars, legislators {{as well as the}} international, European and national Courts struggle to determine key issues, such as who is to be held liable for oil spills, under which conditions and for which damage. The international regime on oil spills was meant to establish an “equilibrium” between the needs of the victims (being compensated for their harm) and the needs of the economic actors (being able to continue their activities). There is, however, a constantly increasing array of legal scholars’ work that criticizes the regime. Indeed, the victims of a recent oil spill, the Erika, have tried to escape the international regime on oil spills and to rely instead on the provisions of national criminal law or <b>EC</b> waste <b>legislation.</b> In parallel, the EC legislator has questioned the sufficiency of the international regime, as it has started preparing legislative acts of its own. One can in fact wonder whether challenging the international liability regime with the European Convention on Human Rights could prove to be a way forward, both for the EC regulators as well as the victims of oil spills. This paper claims that the right to property, as enshrined in Article P 1 - 1 of the Human Rights Convention, could be used to challenge the limited environmental liability provisions of the international frameworks...|$|R

40|$|Oxford University Press, 2013. The EC law {{on family}} reunion {{is said to}} have {{committed}} various offences ranging from racism and sexism to the marginalization of the poor and the abuse of certain human rights. Although EC family reunion law is supposedly based on nationality, it is often perceived to exude implicit racial discrimination. This chapter attempts to look into the rules that are applicable to family members who want to join EC nationals, those who are governed by EC association agreements, and other rules of family reunion. It aims to establish the main features of family reunion as they are viewed by the European Court of Human Rights. This is done through a framework that breaks down such issues into different main aspects: 1) defining who the 'sponsor' is; 2) clarifying what is meant by the term 'family'; and 3) identifying the conditions for having a family reunion. Also, the chapter investigates the criticisms passed on case law and <b>EC</b> <b>legislation,</b> particularly those of human rights...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{brief review of}} regulations and procedures relevant to the authorization of marine aggregate (MA) operations in eight EU Member States.

In general, relevant information is not easily available in accurate, comprehensive and up-to date form. As a result, it is difficult to assess whether and to which extent national practice in relation to MA extraction authorization is in substantive compliance with the requirements of existing international and European rules and regulations aimed at sustainable development and protection of the marine and coastal environment...|$|E
