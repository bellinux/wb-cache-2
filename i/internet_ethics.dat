5000|$|Information and {{communication}} technoethics is [...] "concerned with ethical issues and responsibilities arising {{when dealing with}} information {{and communication}} technology {{in the realm of}} communication." [...] This field is related to <b>internet</b> <b>ethics,</b> rational and ethical decision making models, and information ethics. A major area of interest is the convergence of technologies: as technologies become more interdependent and provide people with multiple ways of accessing the same information, they transform society and create new ethical dilemmas. This is particularly evident in the realms of the internet. In recent years, users have had the unprecedented position of power in creating and disseminating news and other information globally via social networking; the concept of [...] "citizen journalism" [...] primarily relates to this. With developments in the media, has led to open media ethics as Ward writes, leading to citizen journalism.|$|E

Please access the article on the official website of the journal via the DOI link {{at the top of}} the record. The purpose of this paper is to explore the differences and similarities between computer ethics, <b>internet</b> <b>ethics</b> and cyberethics as reflected in the contents of the published literature as well as the search trends on Google. Design/methodology/approach: The paper opted for an informetrics approach, and more specifically content analysis, to investigate the inter-relationships between computer ethics, <b>internet</b> <b>ethics</b> and cyberethics. The data sources for this study included Google Trends, Google Scholar and the Web of Science citation indexes. Different search queries were used, depending on the structure of each data source, to extract the relevant data sets. Findings: Using different methods and techniques to analyse the data, the paper provides an alternative means of investigating relationships among concepts. The findings indicate that there is still no clear distinction between the concepts in terms of subject and title terms used to describe the published literature on the three concepts, as well as the research areas where the three concepts are applied. Going by the current trend, the paper envisages that cyberethics may, in the future, become a broader term to include computer ethics and <b>internet</b> <b>ethics.</b> Research limitations/implications â€“ The data sources that were selected for the study might have not been comprehensive in the coverage of the published literature on the three concepts and therefore there is need for further research, which will expand the scope of the data sources. Practical implications â€“ The paperâ€™s findings may apply in the practice of indexing and abstracting as well as thesaurus construction as far as the three terms are concerned. Originality/value â€“ The paper offers an alternative technique that can be used to investigate relationships among concepts. The value of the paper could include curriculum development of programmes dealing with ethical issues that arise when developing and using computers and related technologies.

40|$|The subject {{relates to}} the Internet {{behavior}} of individuals, communities, corporations, government agencies and governments. The Internet brings a fundamental reshaping of the elements by which people comprehend the world about them. While ethics is concerned with proper codes of behavior, the rapidly emerging surge of computer technology creates much uncertainty that raise the need to establish rules of conduct. Ethical issues arise {{in relation to the}} Internet in various matters relating to: conduct research, business, politics, online education, legal issues, social issues, identity issues and aspects of the private nature of things. There are some features that differentiate the <b>Internet</b> <b>ethics</b> from other domains, as: a cross-cultural foundation and a globalized arena stage with different customs, languages, religions, values and practices, novelty, a new different content and human-oriented tool. In the current activity on Internet, can arise unethical or unacceptable activities, at the different levels of aggregation, from the computers in their workplace, crossing privacy, intellectual property and professional responsibility and arrive/touch the globalization and digital divide. The PLUS decision making model for Ethics is a helpful tool for resolving ethical issues in a structured and systematic way and evaluate the ethical impact of a decision.

40|$|The {{impact and}} {{influence}} of the Internet as a communications medium cannot be overstated. It has {{had a profound effect}} on economic, political, and other social infrastructures, and has introduced ways of communicating which have transformed social relationships. The Internet has opened up information exchange on a global scale, offering enormous opportunities and advantages to an hitherto unknown degree. The Internet has also raised a number of serious, and urgent, ethical challenges. The discussions and debate surrounding ethical issues such as trust, security and privacy, amongst others, conducted at all levels (international, government, academia and the popular press) in themselves are evidence of the complexity of the problem of <b>Internet</b> <b>ethics.</b> The research unravels some of the complexity and muddle of <b>Internet</b> <b>ethics,</b> with the objective of providing a foundation for further research. This thesis offers four perspectives on the problems of Internet ethics: technical, conceptual, regulatory and ethical. These different viewpoints are not only useful in drawing out insights concerning the ethical framework of the Internet, they also provide leverage for the analysis of pertinent issues. The work in this thesis thus offers a framework for understanding, and analysis, which can be developed and used in continuing investigations. The research is a combination of theory and practice - both informing each other. The approach taken arose from the author's direct involvement in many of the expert discussions and debates which (together with the literature), identified a need for foundational work. In-depth work with a number of specialised groups has provided the practical backdrop, and grounding to this research - published results appear as Appendices...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge and capabilities, {{particularly}} {{of a new}} technology or in a new area of study, frequently develop faster than the guidelines and principles needed for practitioners to practice ethically in the new arena; {{this is particularly true}} in medicine. The blending of medicine and healthcare with e-commerce and the Internet raises many questions involving what sort of ethical conduct should be expected by practitioners and developers of the medical Internet. Some of the early pioneers in medical and healthcare Web sites pushed the ethical boundaries with questionable, even unethical, practices. Many involved with the medical Internet are now working to reestablish patient and consumer trust by establishing guidelines to determine how the fundamentals of the medical code of ethical conduct can best be adapted for the medical/healthcare Internet. Ultimately, all those involved in the creation, maintenance, and marketing of medical and healthcare Web sites should be required to adhere to a strict code of ethical conduct, one that has been fairly determined by an impartial international organization with reasonable power to regulate the code. This code could also serve as a desirable, recognizable label-of-distinction for ethical Web sites within the medical and healthcare Internet community. One challenge for those involved with the medical and healthcare Internet will be to determine what constitutes "Medical Internet Ethics" or "Healthcare Internet Ethics," since the definition of medical ethics can vary from country to country. Therefore, the emerging field of Medical/ Healthcare <b>Internet</b> <b>Ethics</b> will require careful thought and insights from an international collection of ethicists in many contributing areas. This paper is a review of the current status of the evolving field of Medical/Healthcare <b>Internet</b> <b>Ethics,</b> including proposed definitions and identification of many diverse areas that may ultimately contribute to this multidisciplinary field. The current role that medicine and health play in the growing area of Internet communication and commerce and many of the ethical challenges raised by the Internet for the medical community are explored and some possible ways to address these ethical challenges are postulated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Our {{students}} ' {{reading comprehension}} skills underpin {{their ability to}} learn the concepts and competencies in computer science. However, {{there has been little}} attention given to evaluating how well our students comprehend what they read and the effectiveness of strategies to improve their reading comprehension. In this paper we focus on the case of a non-major course on <b>internet</b> <b>ethics</b> and the reading of the original writings of key figures in ethical theory. Due to the observed weakness of the reading comprehension skills of the students, we have been teaching our students strategies to improve their skills in reading comprehension and meta-comprehension within the framework of an in-class group reading. The reading strategies we have been using are described, evaluated, and placed {{in the context of the}} reading comprehension literature. Increased awareness of the limitations of the reading comprehension skills of our students and of ways to teach the students strategies to improve those skills should prove useful in helping instructors ensure that our students have the foundation they need to be successful in their computer science studies...|$|E

40|$|The current {{generation}} of adolescents, who are generally described as digital natives, have greater access to and are greater consumers of information than previous generations. However, adolescents are notably at-risk when they are confronted with ethical decisions since they may lack the necessary knowledge and experiences to discern and make the right decisions. This study investigated how the demographic variables of gender and socio-economic status (SES) influence the <b>internet</b> <b>ethics</b> of 825 Secondary 2 (Grade 8) students aged 11 to 16 in Hong Kong. Three unethical behaviours, namely, unauthorised acts (UNAC), internet stickiness (INST), and plagiarism (PLAG) were examined.

Also, students from low SES families tended to behave more unethically than did students from high SES families.
