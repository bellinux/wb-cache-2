40|$|Abstract Background Pleomorphic adenoma of the {{lacrimal}} gland {{is known to}} undergo malignant transformation when incompletely excised. Even if such a malignant change occurs, intracranial direct invasion and leptomeningeal seeding are seldom encountered. Case presentation A 50 -year-old woman presented with malignant transformation associated with both intracranial invasion and multiple intracranial and spinal <b>disseminations</b> in the third recurrence of pleomorphic adenoma of the {{lacrimal gland}}, 6 years after initial treatment. MRI demonstrated increased extent of orbital mass, extending to the cavernous sinus. The patient underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Follow-up MRI showed multiple leptomeningeal <b>disseminations</b> to the intracranium and spine. Conclusion It {{is important to recognize}} that leptomeningeal intracranial and spinal <b>disseminations</b> of pleomorphic adenocarcinoma can occur, although it is extremely rare. To our knowledge, we report the first case of pleomorphic adenocarcinoma of the lacrimal gland presumably metastasizing to the intracranium and spine. </p...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The Seaman Gulch area {{is located}} {{approximately}} 20 {{miles east of}} Redding, California and {{is part of the}} eastern Klamath lithotectonic belt. Rock units of the area are chiefly mafic and silicic volcanics of island arc affinity and shale that are Permian to Triassic in age. Volcanic rocks of Tertiary and Quaternary age unconformably overlie the pre-Tertiary rocks. All pre-Tertiary rocks have been altered by hydro-thermal and(or) metamorphic processes. Stratabound epigenetic mineralization is hosted by metadacitic pyroclastics of the Bully Hill Rhyolite. The hypogene sulfide minerals present are pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite-tennantite and galena. Minor amounts of supergene chalcocite are found. These sulfides occur as <b>disseminations,</b> stringer veinlets, massive pods and an irregular network around pyroclastic fragments. Controls that localized the occurrences of sulfides are intrusive rock-country rock contacts, permeability and porosity of pyroclastic rocks, faults, and fractures. The gangue mineralogy of the stringer veinlets consists of quartz, carbonate, and anhydrite. The distribution of sulfide minerals is zoned vertically and from bottom to top as follows: pyrite - chalcopyrite as <b>disseminations</b> and stringer veinlets; pyrite - sphalerite - chalcopyrite as <b>disseminations,</b> stringer veinlets, and networks; and pyrite - sphalerite - chalcopyrite - tetrahedrite-tennantite - galena as <b>disseminations,</b> stringer veinlets, and massive pods. Hydrothermal alteration assemblages are chloritic alteration, quartz - white mica alteration, propylitic alteration, silicification, argillic alteration, and carbonate alteration. These alteration assemblages display both vertical and lateral zonations. A central zone of chloritic alteration grades laterally into propylitic alteration, and upward into quartz-white mica alteration. The quartz - white mica alteration in turn grades laterally into propylitic alteration. Argillic alteration and carbonate alteration are genetically related but slightly later events that overprint the earlier assemblages. The mineralization in the Seaman Gulch area is similar to the stockwork zone that underlies Kuroko-type volcano-genic massive sulfide deposits. The sulfides and their associated products of hydrothermal alteration were deposited during submarine geothermal activity that was operative during the latest Permian time. The economic potential of the Seaman Gulch area is considered to be low because of the paucity of base metalbearing sulfides, their occurrence as chiefly <b>disseminations</b> and veinlets, and the restricted distribution of economic assays...|$|R
