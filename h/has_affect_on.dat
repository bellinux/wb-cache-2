Methods: In this semi experimental study, a total of 135 students from Zahedan University of Medical Sciences who had inclusion criteria were selected randomly. At the beginning of the work, the refractive errors of the subjects were determined and corrected with retinoscop and their stereopsis measured using T. N. O test. Subsequently, this hyperopic and myopic anisometropia induced by use of negative and positive spherical lenses (power 1, 2, 3 diopter) in trial frame in front of one eye and in each state stereopsis measured again. In agreement and against the rule astigmatic anisometropia induced by positive cylindrical lenses in 180 and 90 degree axes and stereopsis measured again. Data were analyzed by SPPS. 14 software using within subjects factorial and repeated measurement ANOVA test. Results: This study showed that both type and amount of anisometropia had significant effect on stereopsis (P< 0. 001). The mean of stereopsis before intervention was (36. 42 ± 12. 65). The most and least reduction of stereopsis were related to 3 D hyperopic anisometropia (339. 42 ± 125. 1) and 1 D with the rule astigmatic anisometropia (36. 57 ± 12. 6), respectively. The mean of stereopsis before and after different type and amount of induced anisometropia were significantly different (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: The result of this study showed that with increasing of anisometropia, stereoacuity decreases. Therefore, low degree of anisometropia, even 1 D, can decrease both stereopsis and binocular function and thus, the amendment of stereopsis is necessary...|$|E

The study was conducted at one of the largest industries in Norrbotten where three working teams have been examined. The analysis was based on the theory that constituted the study and the descriptions of various experiences from the respondents regarding work demands, control, support and sickness presenteeism. The results show that all the examined working teams experiences that the psychosocial work environment directly affects the sickness presenteeism. Factors such as heavy workload, the work piles up, loyalty to colleagues and the difficulty for others to take over proved crucial for the respondents to work despite illness. Other factors like duties require employee attendance, fear of missing any fun, deadlines and the pressure of delivering on time was also found to affect the sickness presenteeism. The respondents perceive their work situation through high work demands, a heavy workload and at times very stressful. Control varies depending on the examined working team and the support is perceived as high. The obstacle that are perceived to be existing regarding control is primarily for the planners in form of lack of influence over the exportation groups and the technicians that are controlled by the unexpected which makes it difficult for them to plan and control in and over their work. One difficulty in getting support from external divisions is present, which is experienced due to the fact that other colleagues do not have issues clarified for themselves in certain situations like the closest colleagues in the own working team have. In addition, respondents perceive themselves as happy at work and experience the working atmosphere as well and they feel they have good colleagues. This study shows that sickness presenteeism and psychosocial work environment are related and are important issues to work with, both from a human perspective but also from an organizational perspective.

This research involved laboratory experimental work on three {{reinforced concrete}} wall foundation samples. The wall is reinforced with steel fabric of size B 7 and concrete Grade 30 mix with steel fabric. The wall foundation samples were tested under lateral static load with the load applied upper of the wall he ight wall. The support condition was considered as fixed {{at the lower end}} foundation. The ultimate load sustained by the samples is 30 kN with maximum displacement of 35 mm before failure. From the observation, there are failure cracks along the connection and {{at the side of the}} connection that influence the strength of the connection itself. Wall foundation 1 started to crack when load reach the value of 5 kN with maximum deflection of 15. 44 mm while for sample 2, wall foundation started to crack when applied load reach the value of 5. 97 kN with maximum deflection of 10. 37 mm. Lastly, for sample 3, wall foundation started to crack when applied load reach the value of 8. 58 kN with maximum deflection of 20. 13 mm. From research the maximum bending stress for sample 1, 2 and 3 is 3. 75 kN/mm 2, 7. 36 kN/mm 2 and 9. 72 kN/mm 2 respectively.
