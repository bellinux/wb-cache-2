25|$|In {{addition}} to its use as an herbicide, glyphosate is also used for crop desiccation (siccation) to increase harvest yield, {{and as a result}} of desiccation, to increase sucrose concentration in sugarcane before harvest. The application of glyphosate just before harvest on grains (like wheat, barley, and oats) kills the food crop so that it dries more quickly and evenly, similar to the use of dessicants. This dry crop does not have to be windrowed (swathed and dried) prior to harvest but can easily be straight cut and harvested. This saves the farmer time and money,which is important in northern regions where the growing season is short.

60|$|While {{speaking}} of resemblance, {{it is necessary}} to take notice of an ambiguity of language, against which scarcely any one is sufficiently on his guard. Resemblance, when it exists in the highest degree of all, amounting to undistinguishableness, is often called identity, and the two similar things are said to be the same. I say often, not always; for we do not say that two visible objects, two persons, for instance, are the same, because they are so much alike that one might be mistaken for the other: but we constantly use this mode of expression when {{speaking of}} feelings; as when I say that the sight of any object gives me the same sensation or emotion to-day that it did yesterday, or the same which it gives to some other person. This is evidently an <b>incorrect</b> <b>application</b> of the word same; for the feeling which I had yesterday is gone, never to return; what I have to-day is another feeling, exactly like the former, perhaps, but distinct from it; and it is evident that two different persons can not be experiencing the same feeling, in the sense in which we say that they are both sitting at the same table. By a similar ambiguity we say, that two persons are ill of the same disease; that two persons hold the same office; not in the sense in which we say that they are engaged in the same adventure, or sailing in the same ship, but {{in the sense that they}} fill offices exactly similar, though, perhaps, in distant places. Great confusion of ideas is often produced, and many fallacies engendered, in otherwise enlightened understandings, by not being sufficiently alive to the fact (in itself not always to be avoided), that they use the same name to express ideas so different as those of identity and undistinguishable resemblance. Among modern writers, Archbishop Whately stands almost alone in having drawn attention to this distinction, and to the ambiguity connected with it.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 This thesis {{presents}} {{our investigation}} {{of the problem of}} creating an intelligent tutor for solving algebra word problems that employs effective pedagogy. Among our major concerns are the problems of sufficient knowledge and proper knowledge organization. From student protocols and test papers, we derived sets of general purpose strategic rules and computation rules to formulate a cognitive model of problem solving. The model incorporates levels of strategic ability that form a progression from novice to expert. Additional analysis of the data was done to uncover, categorize, generalize, and explain the errors made by students when solving algebra word problems. We implemented a computer program, al-Khorezmi, that exploits the model to trace a student's performance, catch errors and provide corrective feedback explaining the cause of the error, and give help that relates the help to knowledge that it has discussed with the student. The cognitive model emphasizes simulating correct, but not necessarily optimal, strategies that students employ. With our model, we can ensure that a student performs correctly when he employs his own approach before he is taught advanced strategies. Therefore, al-Khorezmi exploits an "understanding" of the student's approach to problem solving. The model incorporates three levels of expertise in the form of strategic rule sets. Al-Khorezmi correlates the strategies with student actions to determine the student's problem-solving skill. We studied the rules of our model to identify relationships important to learning and to interconnect the rules in an extended genetic graph. This knowledge structuring process led to observing that skill improvement can be accomplished (or explained to the student) by applying analogous rules that exploit more powerful methods. Furthermore, problem solving efficiency can be increased (or explained to the student) by combining rules into more powerful rules. Rule simplification can be exploited to establish a simulation model of the generation of errors. Errors are classified as <b>incorrect</b> <b>applications</b> of correct rules, correct <b>applications</b> of <b>incorrect</b> or deviant rules, and <b>incorrect</b> <b>applications</b> of deviant rules. The latter category allows al-Khorezmi to recognize compound errors and account for some of the otherwise unexplained student errors found in our data...|$|R

Statistical methods {{are one of the}} most prominent tools used to facilitate the transformation of the data obtained in scientific research into knowledge. However, due to technical approaches, language and methodology options, difficulties are often experienced in the selection of the correct statistical tool and depending on these issues, <b>incorrect</b> <b>applications</b> of statistical methods are frequently seen in the data analysis phase of biomedical research (Twycross and Shields 2004; McCrum-Gardner 2008; Nyirongo et al. 2008; Okeh 2009; Jaykaran 2010; Nayak and Hazra 2011; Gunawardena 2011).

The species count for the South African Gracilariaceae is now two Gracilariopsis species, and nine Gracilaria species. Gracilaria crassa has been reduced to a synonym of G. canaliculata. It is believed that G. foliifera was erroneously identified and specimens in South Africa referred to as G. millardetii and G. protea are assigned to G. corticata. South African Gracilariopsis, previously referred to as Gs. lemaneiformis, is confirmed to be conspecific with European Gs. longissima. This species occurs along the west and south coasts of South Africa, co-existing in a few habitats with G. gracilis. The taxonomic identity of G. vieillardii specimens from South Africa and the differentiation of G. canaliculata and G. salicornia has been confirmed based on morphology.

40|$|System {{relevant}} {{embedded software}} {{needs to be}} reliable and, therefore, well tested, especially for aerospace systems. A common technique to verify programs is the analysis of their abstract syntax tree (AST). Tree structures can be elegantly analyzed with the logic programming language Prolog. Moreover, Prolog offers further advantages for a thorough analysis: On the one hand, it natively provides versatile options to efficiently process tree or graph data structures. On the other hand, Prolog's non-determinism and backtracking eases tests of different variations of the program flow without big effort. A rule-based approach with Prolog allows to characterize the verification goals in a concise and declarative way. In this paper, we describe our approach to verify the source code of a flash file system {{with the help of}} Prolog. The flash file system is written in C++ and has been developed particularly for the use in satellites. We transform a given abstract syntax tree of C++ source code into Prolog facts and derive the call graph and the execution sequence (tree), which then are further tested against verification goals. The different program flow branching due to control structures is derived by backtracking as subtrees of the full execution sequence. Finally, these subtrees are verified in Prolog. We illustrate our approach with a case study, where we search for <b>incorrect</b> <b>applications</b> of semaphores in embedded software using the real-time operating system RODOS. We rely on computation tree logic (CTL) and have designed an embedded domain specific language (DSL) in Prolog to express the verification goals.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Serbian {{cadastral}} domain model {{as the country}} profile for the real estate cadastre, based on the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM), defined within ISO 19152. National laws and other legal acts were analyzed and the <b>incorrect</b> <b>applications</b> of the law are outlined. The national “Strategy of measures and activities for increasing the quality of services {{in the field of}} geospatial data and registration of real property rights in the official state records”, which was adopted in 2017, cites the shortcomings of the existing cadastral information system. The proposed profile can solve several problems with the system, such as the lack of interoperability, mismatch of graphic and alphanumeric data, and lack of an integrated cadastral information system. Based on the existing data, the basic concepts of the Serbian cadastre were extracted and the applicability of LADM was tested on an obtained conceptual model. Upon obtaining positive results, a complete country profile was developed according to valid national laws and rulebooks. A table of mappings of LADM classes and country profile classes is presented in this paper, together with an analysis of the conformance level. The proposed Serbian country profile is completely conformant at the medium level and on several high-level classes. LADM also provides support for three-dimensional (3 D) representations and 3 D registration of rights, so the creation of a country profile for Serbia is a starting point toward a 3 D cadastre. Given the existence of buildings with overlapping rights and restrictions in 3 D, considering expanding the spatial profile with 3 D geometries is necessary. Possible solutions to these situations were analyzed. Since the two-dimensional (2 D) cadastre in Serbia is not fully formed, the proposed solution is to use the 2 D model for simple right situations, and the 3 D model for more complex situations...|$|R
