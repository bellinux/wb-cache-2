40|$|If {{you want}} to create a really {{successful}} business, you have to do more than win your share of customers or control costs—you have to break the rules and overturn the received wisdom about how things work in your industry. For example, high-priced landing fees are just a cost of business in the airline industry, aren’t they? Ryanair didn’t think so, and it turned Europe’s unused World War II landing strips into very low cost airports. To be a cell phone service provider, you need to invest in towers, networks, billing systems, and more, right? India’s Airtel said no and leased virtually everything it needed from others. In sharply lowering its costs and improving its working capital model, Airtel was able to offer India’s impoverished consumers cell phone service at a dramatically reduced price. How can companies figure out which rules to break in their industries? By focusing on big structural problems endemic to their industries—not just problems they alone face. There are five common types of industry bottlenecks: (1) an outdated purchase or usage experience, (2) a superfluous major <b>expense</b> <b>category,</b> (3) high financial risks for customers, (4) disengaged employees, and (5) detrimental side effects of the product or service.

40|$|In 1998, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) began {{a series}} of marine angler {{expenditure}} surveys in the coastal regions of the United States (U. S.) to evaluate marine recreational fishing expenditures and the financial impacts of these expenditures in each region and the U. S. as a whole. In this report, we use the previously estimated expenditure estimates to assess the total financial impact of anglers’ saltwater expenditures. Estimates are provided for sales, income, employment, and tax impacts for each coastal state in the U. S. Aggregate estimates are also provided for the entire U. S., excluding Alaska, Hawaii, and Texas. Direct, indirect, and induced effects associated with resident and non-resident angler expenditures were estimated using a regional input-output modeling system called IMPLAN Pro. Nationwide, recreational saltwater fishing generated over 30. 5 billion in sales in 2000, nearly 12. 0 billion in income, and supported nearly 350, 000 jobs. Approximately 89 cents of every dollar spent by saltwater anglers was estimated to remain within the U. S. economy. At the state level, many of the goods anglers purchased were imports, and, as such, as little as 44 cents of every dollar stayed in Rhode Island and as much as 80 cents of every dollar stayed in Georgia. In the Northeast, the highest impacts were generated in New Jersey, even though recreational fishing expenditures in Massachusetts and Maryland were considerably higher. In the Southeast, the highest impacts were generated in Florida, and on the Pacific Coast, the highest impacts were generated in California. Expenditures on boat maintenance/expenses generated more impacts than any other expenditure category in the U. S. Expenditures on rods and reels was the single most important <b>expense</b> <b>category</b> in terms of generating impacts in most of the Northeast states. Expenditures on boat expenses generated the highest in most Southeast states, and expenditures for boat accessories produced the highest impacts in most Pacific Coast states.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Youth-friendly {{sexual and}} {{reproductive}} health services (YFHS) have high priority in many countries. Yet, {{little is known}} about the cost and cost-effectiveness of good quality YFHS in resource limited settings. This paper analyses retrospectively costs and potential cost-effectiveness of four well performing youth-friendly health centres (YFHC) in Moldova. This study assesses: (1) what were the costs of YFHSs at centre level, (2) how much would scaling-up to a national good quality YFHS programme cost, and (3) was the programme potentially cost-effective? METHODS: Four well performing YFHCs were selected for the study. YFHS costs were analysed per centre, funding source, service and person reached. The costing results were extrapolated to estimate cost of a good quality national YFHS programme in Moldova. A threshold analysis was carried out to estimate the required impact level for the YFHSs to break-even (become cost saving). RESULTS: Average annual cost of a well performing YFHC was USD 26, 000 in 2011. 58 % was financed by the National Health Insurance Company and the rest by external donors (42 %). Personnel salaries were the largest <b>expense</b> <b>category</b> (47 %). The annual implementation costs of a good quality YFHSs in all 38 YFHCs of Moldova were estimated to be USD 1. 0 million. The results of the threshold analysis indicate that the annual break-even impact points in a YFHC for: 1) STI services would be > 364 averted STIs, 2) early pregnancy and contraceptive services > 178 averted unwanted pregnancies, and 3) HIV services only > 0. 65 averted new HIV infections. CONCLUSIONS: The costing results highlight the following: 1) significant additional resources would be required for implementation of a good quality national YFHS programme, 2) the four well performing YFHCs rely heavily on external funding (42 %), 3) which raises questions about financial sustainability of the programme. At the same time results of the threshold analysis are encouraging. The result suggest that, together the three SRH components (STI, early pregnancy and contraception, and HIV) are potentially cost saving. High cost savings resulting from averted lifetime treatment cost of HIV infected persons are likely to off-set the costs of STIs and unwanted pregnancies...|$|E

Epilepsy affects various aspects of ones' social life. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of marital status {{on the quality of}} life of adult Chinese patients with epilepsy. Methods: This study surveyed 805 Chinese adults who have been clinically diagnosed with epilepsy for longer than 1 year in 11 hospitals in Beijing. In this survey, 532 (66. 1 %) participants were married. All of them completed the case report form with enquiries on demographic data, social factors, and illness. The marriage status of adult epileptic quality of life was the dependent variable, and demographic data and clinical data were independent variables, analyzed through the multiple linear regression analysis methods. The patients' quality of life was assessed using the Quality of Life in patients with Epilepsy- 31 items (QOLIE- 31) questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 items (PHQ- 9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder- 7 items (GAD- 7). Results: The PHQ- 9 and GAD- 7 scores in the unmarried group (PHQ- 9 = 6. 0 and GAD- 7 = 5. 0) were significantly higher than that of the married group (PHQ- 9 = 4. 0 and GAD- 7 = 3. 0). The scores of married adult patients with epilepsy on QOLIE (61. 8 ± 15. 3) and social function (70. 9 ± 22. 7) were higher than the scores of the unmarried patients aged between 20 and 44 years. The scores of married adult epileptics on the QOLIE (58. 4 ± 14. 6) and the energy/fatigue (62. 1 ± 20. 4) were higher than the scores of the unmarried patients (QOLIE = 58. 4 ± 14. 6 and the energy/fatigue = 62. 1 ± 20. 4) aged between 45 and 59 years. For the adult epilepsy patients, depression, anxiety, seizures within the last year, disease course, medical <b>expense</b> <b>category,</b> and marriage* age are negatively correlated with the quality of life. Occupation, educational level, and average monthly income are closely related to the quality of life. Conclusions: Married adult epileptic patients have better quality of life than that of unmarried adult patients in young and middle-aged age groups. Unmarried adult patients with epilepsy are more anxious and depressed than married adult patients...|$|E

Yet, {{little is known about}} the actual cost of delivering YFSRH services. This article analyses costs of a fully scaled up national youth clinic network (YCN) in Estonia. It reports; 1) total budget of the YCN during the period 2002 - 2012, and 2) annual clinic level costs of three youth clinics (YCs) in 2012. METHODS: The retrospective cost analysis is based on financial and medical records of Estonian Health Insurance Fund (EHIF), Estonian Sexual Health Association (ESHA), National Institute for Health Development and the YCs. The programme level costs are analysed per year, financing source and a portion spent on coordination in 2002 - 2012. Costs of three YCs are analysed per clinic, <b>expense</b> <b>category,</b> patient and healthcare service in 2012. RESULTS: The total budget of the YCN was euro 8. 38 million and it served 304, 000 young patients in 2002 - 2012. 95 % of the total budget was financed by the EHIF. 3. 6 % was spent on coordination. The YCs in Tallinn, Tartu and Ida-Virumaa had annual budgets of euro 247, 000, euro 267, 000 and euro 42, 000 respectively. In 2012 the three YCs provided YFSRH services to 19, 700 patients, excluding sexuality education lessons and internet counselling. The YFSRH services cost euro 543, 000. Consequently, the average cost per patient was euro 27. 76. The largest expense categories were personnel salaries 35 % and medical supplies 33 %. Cost of the YFSRH services were; STI consultation euro 54. 80, SRH counselling euro 13. 13, contraception consultation euro 9. 32, internet counselling euro 8. 21 and sexuality education lesson euro 1. 52. CONCLUSIONS: The Estonian YCN is a positive example for other countries considering or already implementing similar programmes. The cost analyses highlighted the following: Sustainable funding is particularly important, without it the YFSRH services would not have been scaled up and sustained on the national level in Estonia. Investment in professional coordination of the YFSRH services is recommended, and it does not necessarily have to be expensive. Only 3. 6 % of the total budget of YCN was used for ESHA coordination, which is a small portion especially when taking into account ESHA's substantial contributions to development, training, quality improvements and representation of the YCN...|$|E

If the mobile crashes or mobile lost {{there is no way to}} take the back up of the data. So if the mobile data is saved in some centralized location the user can save or backup his data even if the mobile is lost or crashed. This is not the only one advantage of this, as we have the centralized database, the development architecture is different. Here we are maintaining SOA, which means once if we have a web service in remote server with centralized database then we can use the same web service for different clients either it may be Android, iPhone, Blackberry, Windows phone, Bada, Java phones, Symbian phones, etc. Different clients can use the common web service to save or retrieve the data. We can also take backup/restore the database from database end. For this to implement the main resource needed is Internet Information Server (IIS) Web Server. For this SOA process the current database MS SQL Server database can also be replaced by other databases like MySQL, Oracle, Postgre, etc. Building an Android application that runs on mobile phones for tracking expenses. The application will store data locally and as well as on the server using web services. Users can enter expenses using the app like name of the <b>expense,</b> <b>category</b> of the expense, amount spent, date, etc. Users can view expenses both in table form and in graph form. This application provides flexibility to users by calculating monthly, yearly and as well selected category wise budget. Many people are unaware of costs and waste scarce resources.

The main aim of the thesis was to identify differences and similarities in consumption among Brazilian households, and estimate the importance of demographic and geographic characteristics. Initially, households belonging to different social classes and geographical regions were compared based on their consumption. For further insights, two cluster analyses were conducted. Firstly, households were grouped according to the absolute values of expenditures. Five clusters were discovered; cluster membership showed larger spending in all of the <b>expense</b> <b>categories</b> for households having higher income, and a substantial association with particular demographic variables, including as region, neighborhood, race and education. Secondly, cluster analysis was performed on proportionate distribution of total spending by every household. Five groups of households were revealed: Basic Consumers, the largest group that spends only on fundamental goods, Limited Spenders, which additionally purchase alcohol, tobacco, literature and telecommunication technologies, Mainstream Buyers, characterized by spending on clothing, personal care, entertainment and transport, Advanced Consumers, which have high relative expenses on financial and legal services, healthcare and education, and Exclusive Spenders, households distinguished by spending on vehicles, real estate and travelling...|$|R
40|$|To date, most {{research}} on Interwar Period economic fluctuations in Japan {{has been based}} on Estimates of Long-term Economic Statistics of Japan (LTES), edited by Kazushi Ohkawa et al. Regardless, the LTES data are just one set of estimations. They require scrutiny, especially for the measurement of personal consumption, which has a high weight in GNE. This paper re-estimates the LTES personal consumption expenditures by adjusting the estimation methods for certain <b>expense</b> <b>categories</b> and deducting imputations (which may have a large measurement error), and then calculates real GDP (adjusted real GDP) focusing on the market economy. The re-estimation presents no major changes from the LTES {{in the shape of the}} economic fluctuations of the 1920 s, when the Japanese economy continuously posted gunbalanced growth. h From the Showa Depression forward, however, while the LTES shows continued positive real GDP growth, the re-estimation indicates negative growth in adjusted real GDP in 1931. These findings remain robust after considering the bias from the deflator formula. Given the characteristics of national accounts and the measurement error, these re-estimation results suggest that the severity of the Showa Depression may have been underestimated in the prior research.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the individual income zakat payment total differences based on Had Kifayah (Sufficiency Bar) of basic life necessities expenses (BLNE) in Malaysia. The unstandardized BLNE causes the inconsistency in {{the payment of}} income zakat although the payers have the same income and expenses. In this study, information about BLNE in each state is analysed qualitatively to understand the unstandardised pattern. Also, the calculation of income zakat {{with the assumption that}} payers have similar income and expenses is done by simulation, aided by online zakat calculator of each state religious council. The result indicates that there are similarities and differences in the types and rates employed. Expenses for ownself, spouse and children are among the expenses list used by all states in the zakat calculation. Nevertheless, a more detailed expenses categorization for spouse and children with different rates and new <b>expenses</b> <b>category</b> exercised in some states, such as chronic disease treatment, disabled dependents and vehicle and home installment, affect the calculation of the total individual income zakat. The simulation analysis shows that Perlis has the smallest total payment, while Kedah has the highest. Thus, this study finds that the unstandardized BLNE leads to the widespread of zakat payment across states. The implication of this study demonstrates that the differences in the BLNE adopted by states requires a review. The rationale of considering the types of BLNE is crucial in giving justice for zakat payers and recipients as practised under the tax exemption in the taxation system...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{estimate}} the rural-urban differences in expenditures of outpatient care, hospital inpatient care, {{hospital emergency room}} services, medications, and total services. Methods. This cross-sectional study used data from the 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The overall sample size for the study was 22, 772. Weighted frequencies, means, or percentages were estimated to illustrate the distribution of each variable. Five two-part utilization models were then fit to determine the likelihood of having nonzero expenses and to identify how residence in a rural versus urban area affected expenditures in our five <b>expense</b> <b>categories.</b> Quantile regressions were estimated to further explore relationships between residence and each quantile of nonzero expenditure. Results. The results of two-part model suggest that rural populations spent more on medications, while urban populations spent more on emergency care. However, no rural-urban difference was found in total health expenditures. The results of quantile regressions suggest that the highest users (at the upper quantiles) of medication and total expenditure experienced the strongest positive effects of living in rural areas. Conclusions. Total health expenditures {{do not seem to}} vary significantly across urban and rural areas. However, rurality does have important effects on those who make the most use of outpatient care and prescription medications. Reviewing total health expenditures for urban and rural populations is not enough. Policymakers should monitor the effects of geographic differences, especially in the highest expenditure quantiles, for specific types of health expenditures.

In accounting terminology, fixed costs will broadly include almost all costs (expenses) which {{are not included in}} cost of goods sold, and variable costs are those captured in costs of goods sold. The implicit assumption required to make the equivalence between the accounting and economics terminology is that the accounting period is equal to the period in which fixed costs do not vary in relation to production. In practice, this equivalence does not always hold, and depending on the period under consideration by management, some overhead expenses (e.g., sales, general and administrative expenses) can be adjusted by management, and the specific allocation of each <b>expense</b> to each <b>category</b> will be decided under cost accounting.|$|R

Material and Method: The ABC and VED analysis of the medical store of a Neuropsychiatry hospital at Delhi, India was conducted for the year 2008 - 2009 to identify the categories of items needing stringent management control. Results: The total number of the drugs at the medical store was 145 drugs. The total annual drug expenditure (ADE) on these drug items was Rs. 19219594. 79. ABC analysis revealed 3. 45 %, 6. 9 % and 89. 65 % items as A, B and C category items, respectively, accounting for 70. 5 %, 19. 68 % and 9. 83 % of ADE of the medical store. VED analysis showed 32. 41 %, 61. 38 % and 6. 2 % items as V, E, and D category items, respectively, accounting for 70. 9 %, 28. 72 % and 0. 38 % of ADE of the medical store. On ABC-VED matrix analysis, 33. 8 %, 60 % and 6. 2 % items {{were found to be}} category I, II and III items, respectively, accounting for 92. 33 %, 7. 29 % and 0. 38 % of ADE of the medical store. Conclusion: It is suggested by the study that the management of Category I drugs should be done by the top management resulting in strin gent control on the annual <b>expenses.</b> The <b>Category</b> II should be managed by the middle management level and Category III at lower managerial level. </span...|$|R
40|$|A {{multiple}} regression analysis of domestic and local airline indirect costs was carried out to formulate cost estimating equations for airline indirect costs. Data from CAB and FAA sources covering the years 1962 - 66 was used, and the costs were broken down into the classification of the uniform system of accounts Form 41, used by the airlines in reporting to the CAB. Thus regression equations were found for 1) annual system <b>expenses</b> in the <b>categories</b> such as Passenger Servicing, Traffic Servicing, Promotion and Sales, General and Administrative, etc. {{as well as an}} overall indirect operating cost; and 2) annual station expenses where the Aircraft and Traffic Servicing expenses for individual stations are examined. A stepwise regression technique is used to select the best combinations of independent variables for the equations. The independent variables were data such as revenue passenger miles, passengers enplaned, revenue aircraft miles, total revenue aircraft departures, etc. The results generally showed that a high degree of correlation could be found between the costs and some combination of these variables.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{discover}} whether or not the cost of living differs significantly within Portugal. That can be done by calculating regional price indices, usually called purchasing power parities when comparing different countries. We refer to these indices as cost of living indices. The calculation of cost of living indices is done in two steps. Firstly, price indices are computed within each category of goods and services. These categories are usually called basic headings. Secondly, those price indices are aggregated using as weights the <b>expenses</b> in each <b>category.</b> In our study, we present two methods of calculating price indices at the basic heading level: the CPD (Country-Product-Dummy) and the EKS. (Elteto-Koves-Szulc) (United Nations, 1992). Both possess two desirable properties of price indices: transitivity and base invariance. Additionally, the availability of all the prices in each category is not required, preventing the waste of information implied by using only prices of goods and services common to all regions. Concerning the aggregation methods, it is generally accepted that the Ideal Fisher Index is the best to compare two countries (regions). However, there is n...|$|R
40|$|In the paper, the {{verification}} of forecasts of precipitation conditions {{measured by the}} standardized precipitation index (SPI) is presented. For the {{verification of}} categorical forecasts, a contingency table was used. Standard verification measures {{were used for the}} SPI value forecast. The 30 -day SPI, moved every 10 days by 10 days, was calculated in 2013 – 2015 from April to September on the basis of precipitation data from 35 meteorological stations in Poland. Predictions of the 30 -day SPI were created in which precipitation was forecasted for the next 10 days (the SPI 10 -day forecast) and 20 days (the SPI 20 -day forecast). For both the 10 and 20 days, the forecasts were skewed towards drier <b>categories</b> at the <b>expense</b> of wet <b>categories.</b> There was a good agreement between observed and 10 -day forecast categories of precipitation. Less agreement is obtained for 20 -day forecasts—these forecasts evidently “over-dry” the assessment of precipitation anomalies. The 10 -day SPI value forecast accuracy is very good or good depending on the performance measure, whereas accuracy of the 20 -day forecast is unsatisfactory. Both for the SPI categorical and the SPI value forecast, the 10 -day SPI forecast is trustworthy and the 20 -day forecast should be accepted with reservation and used with caution...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{discusses}} the spatial planning legislation between 1984 and 2010; it defines the spatial planning acts, their division and hierarchy. In more detail, are presented ordinances amending the spatial {{components of the}} long-term plan and municipal spatial plan for municipalities Litija and Zagorje ob Savi. The main objective of the thesis was to investigate and compare the basic and detailed land use leading to settlements in both municipalities. The diploma thesis also describes the methodological approach for the comparison of the land use of the municipalities. It shows the comparison and transformation of land use categories, which are also displayed graphically, from the Rules on the drawing-up of the spatial components of the medium and long-term social plans of municipalities in a digital form (2003) in categories from the Rules on the content, format and drawing-up of a municipal spatial plan and on criteria for specifying dispersed settlement areas in need of restoration and for specifying areas for new settlements (2007). Furthermore, it shows the economic, agricultural and {{demographic characteristics of the}} discussed municipalities, which have an indirect effect on land use and results of the analysis. At the end of the thesis is displayed the surfaces analysis of the basic and detailed land use, according to the number of residents in both municipalities and their leading settlements. A comparison of volume basic land use of residents in settlements and both municipalities is shown. It is determined which land use categories were changed, for how much and at the <b>expense</b> of which <b>categories...</b>|$|R
