40|$|Perverse {{subsidies}} including fuel tax rebates lead to overfishing {{though a}} combination of overcapacity and excess fishing effort. The current overfishing trend has depleted certain key commercial fisheries with implications for future food security, particularly in regions dependent on fish protein. Over {{the course of the}} past four decades, there have been a number of multilateral efforts to eliminate the subsidies including environmental treaties, environmental targets, and trade negotiations. None of these attempts and a global cooperative response have achieved a reduction in perverse subsidies. This Essay proposes the adoption of unilateral <b>trade</b> <b>measures</b> or a set of “Friends of the Fish” <b>trade</b> <b>measures</b> to eliminate perverse subsidies. As explained in the Essay, parties that might oppose these <b>trade</b> <b>measures</b> would be unlikely to prevail in a dispute settlement based on previous decisions from the World Trade Organization (WTO) Appellate Body involving conservation of natural resources. Further, although unilateralism may not be optimal, it may be sufficient to create changes in the subsidization practices as states who continue to subsidize fishing fleets lose access to important trading markets...|$|R

In addition, it summarizes EU and US <b>trade</b> <b>measures</b> which aim to help the recovery.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which international trade law can serve as a means to enforce workers' rights in developing countries, considered from a human rights point of view. The first chapter {{examines the}} protection of the most important workers rights under international law. The basic problem in this protection is that workers' rights are limited in their enforcement. Therefore, international <b>trade</b> <b>measures</b> could be used to enforce these rights. A first way to use international trade law for the enforcement of workers' rights is by unilaterally imposing a set of workers' rights in the trade relations between two countries. This is the topic of the second chapter. These measures are used in both the United States and the European Community. Unilateral <b>trade</b> <b>measures</b> can be distinguished as non-reciprocal trade aid programs and reciprocal trade relations, the former being much less controversial that the latter from an international law point view. In the third chapter, multilateral <b>trade</b> <b>measures,</b> the second way to use international <b>trade</b> <b>measures,</b> are discussed. This discussion focuses on the social clause in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade context and similar regimes. This study will demonstrate the position that a social clause is to be favoured, but only as an additional way to enforce workers' rights, and only if changes to the existing procedures are made. The thesis concludes by calling for a social dimension in international trade regulation, but warns that a social clause in a multilateral trade agreement should be approached with realism and prudence...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{governments have}} {{negotiated}} {{a number of}} Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) that include clauses regarding <b>trade</b> <b>measures</b> that conflict with their WTO obligations. As yet, {{there has been no}} formal dispute regarding which obligations should prevail, but the threat of conflict is perceived to be sufficiently grave for the parties to the Doha Ministerial to agree to examine the issue. Those who have strong preferences for environmental amenities have put considerable effort into fostering MEAs and are lobbying hard for them to prevail over the WTO in their areas of competence. The current lack of transparency caused by conflicting rules increases the degree of risk perceived in the international commercial environment. As MEAs allow trading partners to impose trade barriers on ratifying partners when the WTO rules would not, a perverse set of incentives is created that may lead to sub-optimal levels of environmental protection as well as sub-optimal amounts of investment in trade-related activities. The use of <b>trade</b> <b>measures</b> in MEAs is examined and suggestions are provided for removing the conflicting rules of trade.

40|$|This report {{examines}} the market outcomes of different policy options {{that could be}} adopted {{in the event of}} a future spike in the world price of wheat and rice. The three policies – additional border measures, consumer subsidies or public stocks – only partly mitigate the effect of a price spike on consumers in the implementing countries. However, taxpayer costs can be large, particularly for broad consumer subsidies or to build and carry grain stocks. <b>Trade</b> <b>measures</b> reduce domestic prices to producers, suppressing long-run supply response. There are also negative unintended consequences for international markets and market participants in other countries that trade on these markets. New consumer subsidies or <b>trade</b> <b>measures</b> introduced by some countries to offset rising international grain prices causes those prices to rise even more in other countries. Releasing public stocks eases tight markets and lowers prices in all markets, helping to reduce the price spike, but stock building and rebuilding phases mean higher market prices and less food consumption at other times. In conclusion, none of these policies is an unambiguous solution that sustains food consumption during times of high prices with minimal taxpayer and other costs. food security, Commodity price spike, consumer subsidies, <b>trade</b> <b>measures,</b> public stocks...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} our {{environment}} is a global concern. Despite an increasing awareness, setting internationally binding commitments {{has proven to be}} a challenging process. In the absence of a stringent international framework, states seek alternatives to promote environmental protection. Can states unilaterally impose <b>trade</b> <b>measures</b> targeting foreign production processes in order to protect transboundary environmental resources? Does WTO law allow for these ‘extraterritorial’ <b>trade</b> <b>measures?</b> This thesis examines extraterritoriality in the trade-environment debate. The WTO legal texts are silent on their jurisdictional scope and the case law has been scarce and incoherent. Part I discusses the relevant legal provisions and dispute settlement reports dealing with jurisdictional issues. Part II adopts a comparative perspective on extraterritoriality in different legal fields. Part III builds upon the lessons learned in Part II, proposing an extraterritoriality decision tree to assess the acceptability of <b>trade</b> <b>measures</b> targeting production within the framework of Article XX GATT. This decision tree is tested through case-studies: the WTO case US-Shrimp is revisited, in addition to EU environmental <b>measures</b> (fishing, emission <b>trading,</b> timber). This research demonstrates that the WTO legal regime does not constitute an impediment to global environmental action. Current WTO law leaves more room than is often thought...|$|R

In the reign of Alexander I (ruled 1107-1124) mention first appears of Aberdeen (originally called Abordon and, in the Norse sagas, Apardion), which received its charter from William the Lion in 1179, by which date its burgesses had already combined with those of Banff, Elgin, Inverness and other trans-Grampian communities to form a free Hanse, under which they enjoyed <b>exceptional</b> <b>trading</b> privileges.
