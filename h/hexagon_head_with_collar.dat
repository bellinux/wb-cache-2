25|$|Adult Echinostoma {{have two}} suckers: an {{anterior}} oral sucker and a ventral sucker. They {{also have a}} characteristic <b>head</b> <b>collar</b> <b>with</b> spines surrounding their oral sucker. The number of collar spines varies between Echinostoma species, but there are usually between 27 and 51. These spines can be arranged {{in one or two}} circles around the sucker, and their arrangement may be a characteristic feature of an Echinostoma species.|$|R
40|$|Cervical {{fractures}} {{are rare}} in paediatric population. In younger children, cervical fractures usually occur above {{the level of}} C 4; whereas in older population, fractures or dislocations more commonly involve the lower cervical spine. Greater elasticity of intervertebral ligaments and also the spinal vertebrae explains why cervical fractures in paediatric ages are rare. The injury usually results from a symmetric or asymmetric axial loading. In paediatric cases, most fractures occur through the synchondroses which are the weakest links of the atlas. The prognosis depends on {{the severity of the}} spinal cord injury. In this case, we presented an anterior fracture in synchondrosis of atlas after falling on <b>head</b> treated <b>with</b> cervical <b>collar.</b> There was no neurologic deficit for the following 2 years...|$|R
5000|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{on older}} Torx heads {{is that the}} smaller internal [...] "splines" [...] can corrode relatively easily and cause the Torx driver to slip and damage the head, {{making it more difficult}} to remove than the traditional <b>hexagon</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
40|$|Metacercariae of Acanthoparyphium marilae Yamaguti, 1934 (Digenea: Echinostomatidae) were {{discovered}} in an intertidal clam, Mactra veneriformis, in a southwestern coastal area of the Republic of Korea. A total of 128 metacercariae were detected from 10 clams examined. They were round, 320 µm in average diameter, <b>with</b> 23 <b>collar</b> spines. They were fed experimentally to chicks, and 10 days later adult flukes were obtained. The adults were morphologically characterized by the <b>head</b> <b>collar</b> <b>with</b> a single row of 23 dorsally uninterrupted spines, without special end group spines, a round ventral sucker, 2 round and tandem testes, and vitellaria extending at lateral fields from the posterior extremity not beyond the middle level of the posterior testis. The most characteristic feature of this species was the limited distribution of vitellaria, which differs from Acanthoparyphium tyosenense Yamaguti, 1939, the metacercariae of which are encysted in the same mollusk species. This is the first report in which the metacercariae of this species were detected, and the intertidal bivalve, M. veneriformis, {{has been identified as}} a second intermediate host for A. marilae...|$|R

40|$|Recently, by the {{development}} of computer technology, the system of computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) is being utilized and is being popularized in many enterprises, and it is a necessary for design or drafting in many industrial fields such as machine design. Under these back ground, 4 engineering work stations for CAD/CAM was introduced at Tsuyama National College of Technology in 1990. Therefore, {{the development}} and investigation on many educational system or soft ware of CAD/CAM that enable to utilize for machine design and drafting, engineering experimentation, engineering work and so on will be necessary. This investigation was performed as a objection to draw up a model for <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> bolt and to practice the parametric component graphic analysis (PCM), Results obtained are follows; 1) A program for PCM was developed and practiced. 2) A model of <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> bolt was drawn up...|$|R
