25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
500|$|Kellogg sent three {{dispatch}}es back to Lounsberry, {{the last}} one {{four days before the}} battle when they were near the mouth of the Rosebud River. His last dispatch read, [...] "By the time this reaches you we would have met and fought the red devils, with what result remains to be seen. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> Custer and will be at the death." [...] Kellogg was not predicting his own death or Custer's defeat; instead, [...] "at the death" [...] is a phrase borrowed from fox hunting meaning [...] "present at the kill" [...] (viz., of the pursued).|$|E

500|$|Bacon later {{stated that}} [...] "painting {{has nothing to}} do with {{colouring}} surfaces", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: [...] "When I feel that I have to some extent formed the image, I put the background in to see how it's going to work and then <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> the image itself." [...] He told David Sylvester that he intended his [...] "hard, flat, bright ground" [...] to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that [...] "for this work, it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear. I think that probably is why I have used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself". Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with [...] "great energy"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element. He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures.|$|E
500|$|The {{prospect}} of a Gore candidacy arose again between 2006 and early 2008 {{in light of the}} upcoming 2008 presidential election. Although Gore frequently stated that he had [...] "no plans to run", he did not reject the possibility of future involvement in politics which led to speculation that he might run. This was due in part to his increased popularity after the release of the 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. The director of the film, Davis Guggenheim, stated that after the release of the film, [...] "Everywhere <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> him, they treat him like a rock star." [...] After An Inconvenient Truth was nominated for an Academy Award, Donna Brazile (Gore's campaign chairwoman from his 2000 campaign) speculated that Gore might announce a possible presidential candidacy during the Oscars. During the 79th Academy Awards ceremony, Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio shared the stage to speak about the [...] "greening" [...] of the ceremony itself. Gore began to give a speech that appeared to be leading up to an announcement that he would run for president. However, background music drowned him out and he was escorted offstage, implying that it was a rehearsed gag, which he later acknowledged. After An Inconvenient Truth won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, speculation increased about a possible presidential run. Gore's popularity was indicated in polls which showed that even without running, he was coming in second or third among possible Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Edwards. Grassroots draft campaigns also developed with the hope that they could encourage Gore to run. Gore, however, remained firm in his decision and declined to run for the presidency.|$|E
2500|$|Gray {{asked that}} no {{member of his}} family witness the execution, which he {{described}} as [...] "murder," [...] although a female cousin and a minister were present. The only witness for the victims present at the execution was Kevin Cummins, the uncle of the two girls. Gray also made no last meal request and gave no instructions for the disposal of his body. His final statement: [...] "I go forward now on wings built by the love and support of my family and friends. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> {{a peace of mind}} that comes from never having taken a human life. I forgive those who have hardened their hearts to the truth and I pray they ask forgiveness, for they know not what they do. This is not a death, it is a lynching." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gibson {{was raised}} a Sedevacantist traditionalist Catholic. When {{asked about the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} of Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus, Gibson replied, [...] "There is no salvation for those outside the Church ... I believe it. Put it this way. My wife is a saint. She's a much better person than I am. Honestly. She's... Episcopalian, Church of England. She prays, she believes in God, she knows Jesus, she believes in that stuff. And it's just not fair if she doesn't make it, she's better than I am. But that is a pronouncement from the chair. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] When he was asked whether [...] is an intolerant position, he said that [...] "through the merits of Jesus' sacrifice... even people who don't know Jesus are able to be saved, but through him." [...] Acquaintance Father William Fulco has said that Gibson denies neither the Pope nor Vatican II. Gibson told Diane Sawyer that he believes non-Catholics and non-Christians can go to Heaven.|$|E

6000|$|... "Though {{most of the}} few {{meetings}} were accidental, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> Hetty intentionally on two occasions because it seemed fitting." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{little while}} after, at her request, <b>I</b> <b>went,</b> <b>with</b> {{my husband and}} son, to pass an evening at her house.|$|R
60|$|Lamon did {{get your}} deeds. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> {{him to the}} office, got them, {{and put them in}} his hands myself.|$|R

6000|$|... "Stop, Francis!" [...] he cried, hoarsely. [...] "Thinkest thou that I {{will stay}} behind to do yon dog's dirty work? No; <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> ye." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fisc. To {{have his}} blood is not amiss, so far <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> you; but {{take me with}} you further for the means: First, what's the injury? ...|$|E

6000|$|Then {{the wife}} paused before {{she asked the}} next question,--paused for some minute or two, and then asked it with anxious doubt,--"And may <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> you, Josiah?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then he does know. Who {{can have}} told him? He always knows everything. Oh, Hetta, what am I to do? Where shall <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> this wretched boy?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He told me--he {{told me when}} <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> him to the studio!" [...] Francie asseverated loud. [...] "But {{he seems}} to have printed more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir--at {{least in}} a permiscuous {{sort of way}} entertainin' myself as <b>I</b> <b>goes</b> <b>with</b> {{agreeable}} talk, and improvin' obsarvation of the shop winders, etceterrer." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But I am {{not afraid}} of Betty's bar. He growls at me when I throw sticks at him, and snaps his teeth. Can <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> you next time?" ...|$|E
60|$|It did {{not take}} me long to start upon that unknown way, nor did <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> caution, {{although}} I knew {{that there might be}} grave dangers before me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh she didn't {{want me to}} do it--the day <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> him, the day I told him. She {{tried to}} prevent me," [...] Francie insisted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Although I haven't long {{joined the}} club, sir, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> Gordon when he {{explored}} the Cascades from Rawden. If you go, I'd {{like to join}} you." ...|$|R
