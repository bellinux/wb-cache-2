Drawing on the literature on social structure, this paper attempts to untangle the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> ethnic networks on international trade using trade data of Thailand. We found that ethnic {{networks have}} a positive impact overall on trade, confirming the results of previous studies. However, the magnitude <b>of</b> the positive <b>effect</b> varies across different ethnicities along two dimensions. First, the strength of family ties in the culture of origin accelerates the pro-trade <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> its ethnic networks, suggesting ethnicities with stronger family ties have a cultural preference for trading within their own ethnic community. In comparison, ethnic diversity weakens the positive <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> ethnic networks on trade, suggesting an informational value of diverse ethnic structure in promoting trade between different ethnicities.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyse the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> Science and Technology Parks (STPs) on firms’ {{innovation}} outcomes, contingent on firms’ size and innovation effort. Despite the worldwide diffusion of STPs and the increasing literature aimed at analyzing their effect on tenants’ performance, empirical evidence on the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> STPs location on different firms is very scarce. We use information for {{a representative sample of}} 39, 722 Spanish firms, 653 of them located on 22 of the 25 official Spanish STP. Results show, on the one hand, that firm size is negatively related to an STP location effect and, on the other, that only a small amount of internal innovation effort is required to achieve a very high return from park location. However, firms without innovation efforts do not benefit from a park location. Finally, as internal innovation efforts increase, the park effect reduces, but is still at a high level. ...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} the impact of college quality on early labor market {{outcomes}} in China, including the fresh college graduates' initial employment status and starting wages for students who graduated in 2011. The main data source is the College Student Labor Market (CSLM) survey conducted by Tsinghua University. Distinguished from previous Chinese studies that merely utilized the broad and abstract college quality categories to measure college quality in China, input-based school resource indicators, including faculty-student ratio, proportion of faculty members holding doctoral degrees, average freshman National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) score, and teaching expenditure per student are collected to measure college quality in China for the first time. To identify the causal <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> college quality, the instrumental variable approach and the propensity score matching method are employed {{to account for the}} endogeneity of elite college attendance in addition to the traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. To explore the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> college quality varying by student and family background characteristics, a series of interaction terms are generated in the OLS regressions. The quantile regressions are employed {{to explore the}} <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> college quality varying by earning distribution. Moreover, the Heckman correction approach is used to test for potential sample selection bias. This study finds solid evidence that elite college attendance generally has a positive and statistically significant effect on the initial employment status and starting salaries for fresh college graduates who intend to work after college graduation. I find weak support for the existence <b>of</b> <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> college quality. Less-capable students tend to benefit more from attending elite colleges. However, the impact of college quality does not seem to vary by graduates' earning distribution. When using the input-based college quality measures, the results suggest that the quality gap does exist between elite and non-elite colleges in China and the major finding that there is a positive impact of college quality on the starting salary still holds. Some input indicators have stronger correlations with college graduates' starting wages than others...|$|R
