40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four parts: 	Part 1, comprised of Chapters I and II, {{consists of}} this introduction and some background information. It aims to provide the reader with the context necessary to obtain a workable understanding of the Canadian marine Arctic, the NWP, the shipping that occurs therein and some basic information on <b>ice</b> <b>breaking.</b> However, spatial considerations only allow for minimal coverage. Possible terminology clarification and definitions are also provided. 	Part 2, comprised of Chapter III, focuses on the first research question. Namely, it explores aspects of the international legal framework for Arctic shipping relevant in respect of <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> in the NWP. Again, spatial considerations do not permit an in-depth examination, so the author has selectively presented only those aspects deemed essential {{for the purposes of}} this thesis. 	Part 3, comprised of Chapters IV and V, focuses on the second and third research questions. First, Chapter IV provides a presentation of the laws, regulations and practices in relation to <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> in the NWP. From this presentation, the author establishes the instances in which a vessel navigating in the NWP is legally required to obtain icebreaker assistance. Second, Chapter V contains an analysis of the consistency of Canadian practice in relation to <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> in the NWP (presented in Chapter IV) with international law in light of the aspects of the international framework for Arctic shipping (presented in Chapter III). 	Part 4, comprised of Chapter VI, attempts to conclude on the adequacy of the Canadian practice in relation to <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> in light of the challenges for the NWP related to climate change, marine environmental security, and creeping jurisdiction...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to clarify the formation, break and flow of river ice on frozen rivers. The {{aim of this study}} is to clarify <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> and flow phenomena during river ice breakup, as these phenomena are the initial stages of ice jam. With regard to the <b>break</b> of river <b>ice,</b> we developed a method of judging <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> by comparing the stress caused by the flowing water and flowing ice, and the allowable bending stress of the river ice. The ice flow is expressed using the continuity equation that considers the change in amount of ice, and the equation of motion that considers the effect of the flowing water. This one-dimensional mathematical model showed that although there is a problem with the reproducibility of ice jam, it is possible to reproduce <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> and flow phenomena by comparing the freezing conditions from the results of the calculations, with those of aerial images of the actual river...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{commonly}} said that [...] "the Teutonic knights and crusaders attempted to rally and regroup {{at the far}} side of the lake, however, the thin ice began to give way and cracked under the weight of their heavy armour, and many knights and crusaders drowned"; but Donald Ostrowski in Alexander Nevskii’s [...] "Battle on the Ice": The Creation of a Legend contends that the part about the <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> and people drowning was a relatively recent embellishment to the original historical story. He cites a large number of scholars who have written about the battle, Karamzin, Solovev, Petrushevskii, Khitrov, Platonov, Grekov, Vernadsky, Razin, Myakotin, Pashuto, Fennell and Kirpichnikov, none of whom mention the <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> up or anyone drowning when discussing the battle on the ice. After analysing all the sources Ostrowski concludes that the part about <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> and drowning appeared first in the 1938 film Alexander Nevsky by Sergei Eisenstein.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} an ice tank experiment that investigated the <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> performance of circular and sidewall Air Cushion Icebreaker Bows (AICBs) proposed in 1984 by German and Milne Incorporated. The model {{tests were conducted}} in the ice tank at the Institute for Marine Dynamics of the National Research Council Canada. The objective {{was to examine the}} <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> capability of the two designs so as to better understand the <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> mechanisms. Data available from field and other model tests were also compared against the present data. In reviewing the data, it was found that for the circular craft the towing resistance for an intact wheet closely matches that of a presawn sheet with the same thickness. This suggests that the breaking component of resistance is insignificant and that ice strength properties scaling laws were developed and used for data presentation. For the sidewall craft, strength properties cannot be ignored because the resistance due to the shearing action of its sidewalls is significant. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the role}} of topography, tree stand characteristics and management on the susceptibility of forest stands to abiotic natural disturbances. In 1996, stands of Börzsöny Mts, Hungary were hit by a severe ice storm, then by strong winds three years later. Affected areas were mapped on aerial photos, and we built a GIS database containing variables describing topography and tree stand characteristics. The role of variables in predicting <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> and windfall was investigated by non-parametric statistical tests and {{by a series of}} C&RT (Classification and Regression Tree) analyses. Elevation, aspect and slope proved to have strong statistical relationships with the distribution of both <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> and windfall, with misclassification error (MER) of 18 % and 15 %, respectively, if studied without stand descriptors. Mixing ratio and age of beech were the most important stand descriptors to explain the distribution of <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> (MER= 15 %), whereas that of windfall was best described by the age and height of the two dominant tree species (MER= 11 %). The explanatory power could be increased if all variables (topographic + stand descriptors) were considered, though the increase in explanatory power was higher in the case of <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> (MER decreased from 15 % to 11 %) than for windfall (MER decreased from 11 % to 10 %). Since management related stand variables (beech mixture ratio, age, height, amount of recently felled stock, slenderness) and susceptibility to disturbance events seemed to be related, our results suggest that the sensitivity of tree stands could be decreased by increasing compositional and structural heterogeneity...|$|R

Because a buildup of broken ice in front of a ship can slow it down much more than the <b>breaking</b> of the <b>ice</b> itself, icebreakers have a specially designed hull to direct the broken ice around or under the vessel.
