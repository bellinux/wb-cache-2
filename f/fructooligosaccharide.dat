Different prebiotics showed contradictory effects on {{intestinal microbiota}}. The present study investigates {{the effects of}} different levels of two prebiotics, galacto- and <b>fructooligosaccharide</b> on intestinal microbiota of Caspian roach fry which is a commercially valuable species of Caspian sea. Materials and methods: The study was performed as a randomized design with 5 treatments and 3 replications in which Caspian roach were fed different levels, 0, 1, and 2 % of galacto- and <b>fructooligosaccharide</b> prebiotics for 6 weeks. At {{the end of the}} trial culture, analysis of intestinal microbiota include lactic acid bacteria levels, total bacteria as well as proportion of LAB were performed by using MRS agar, Plate count agar media. Results: Administration of different levels of galacto- and <b>fructooligosaccharide</b> had no significant effects on total bacteria of intestinal microbiota (P > 0. 05). The lactic acid bacteria levels significantly increased compared to control group following prebiotics administration in diet (P > 0. 05).

The highest LAB proportion in intestinal microbiota was observed in roach fed diet which contains 2 % galactooligosaccharide (P > 0. 05). Discussion and conclusion: The {{results of the present study}} revealed that prebiotics can be used for modulation of Caspian roach intestinal microbiota toward beneficial bacterial communities.

Rats consumed an 18 percent casein-based diet or diet supplemented with 6 percent <b>fructooligosaccharide</b> or maltodextrin for 14 days. The synbiotic group was gavaged 1 ml of L. fermentum BR 11 (1 x 10 (9) cfu/ml) twice daily. From Days 7 to 14, colitis was induced via 3 percent dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water. Disease activity was assessed daily, and at killing, gastrointestinal organs were measured, weighed, and examined by quantitative histology, proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry, and colonic myeloperoxidase activity. Administration of dextran sulfate sodium resulted in an increased colitic disease activity, and an increased colon and cecum weight compared with normal controls. Colon and cecum weights were further increased in dextran sulfate sodium+fructooligosaccharide (colon: 19 percent; cecum: 48 percent) and dextran sulfate sodium+fructooligosaccharide/L. fermentum BR 11 -treated rats (16 and 62 percent) compared with dextran sulfate sodium+vehicle-treatment. Dextran sulfate sodium+fructooligosaccharide-treated rats displayed an 81 percent increase in colonic myeloperoxidase activity compared with dextran sulfate sodium-treated controls. Histologic damage severity scores increased in dextran sulfate sodium+vehicle, dextran sulfate sodium+fructooligosaccharide, and dextran sulfate sodium+fructooligosaccharide/L. fermentum BR 11 -treated rats compared with normal controls (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Non-digestible {{oligosaccharides}} {{are complex}} carbohydrates of the non-a-glucan type which, {{because of the}} configuration of their osidic bonds, resist hydrolysis by salivary and intestinal digestive enzymes. In the colon they are fermented by anaerobic bacteria. Among the non-digestible oligosaccharides, the chicory <b>fructooligosaccharides</b> occupy a key position and, in most european countries, they are recognised as natural food ingredients. The other major products are the short chain <b>fructooligosaccharides</b> and galactooligosaccharides obtained by enzymatic synthesis using sucrose and lactose as substrates respectively, the soybean oligosaccharides, the xylooligosaccharides produced by partial hydrolysis of xylans and polydextrose or pyrodextrins prepared by a chemical treatment of carbohydrates. The most well known effect of most non-digestible oligosaccharides, and in particular of the <b>fructooligosaccharides,</b> is the selective stimulation {{of the growth of}} Bifidobacteria thus modifying significantly the composition of the colonic microbiota. Such a modification, which has clearly been demonstrated in human volunteers, is meant to be benificial in part because it is accompanied by a significant {{reduction in the number of}} bacteria reported to have pathogenic potential.
