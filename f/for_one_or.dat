However, using a chunky-style apple sauce {{can result in a}} cake with less moisture, {{compared}} to using standard apple sauce. Letting it sit <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two days before serving can increase its flavor, as this allows time for the ingredients to intermingle within the cake.|$|E

5|$|A {{declaration}} is a pronouncement {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court.

There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E

Typically a potential customer just {{walked into the}} main office in Helsinki or factory in Hämeenlinna and described what kind of vehicle he wanted. The enthusiastic engineers listened carefully to every individual customer's wishes and designed vehicles accordingly, {{with two or three}} axles, desired layout, wheelbase and with conventional or forward control cabin. Many vehicle types were only produced <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two units. The volume model, however, was a nine-tonne variant of the VAK series.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} century BC {{additional}} lines of bank and ditch were constructed {{turning it into a}} multivallate hillfort which is now known as the castle. There is evidence that the fort was violently taken in around AD43 and that the defences were further slighted later in the 1st century after the construction of a Roman army barracks on the hilltop. Excavations of the southwest gate in 1968 and 1969 revealed evidence <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more severe violent episodes, associated with weaponry and destruction by fire. Whereas the excavator, Leslie Alcock, believed this to have been dated to around AD70, Richard Tabor argues for a date associated with the initial invasion, either AD43 or 44. Michael Havinden states that it was the site of vigorous resistance by the Durotriges and Dobunni to the second Augusta Legion under the command of Vespasian.|$|E
5|$|From a {{starting}} point on the frontier, {{if there is no}} increase in productive resources, increasing production of a first good entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second. Points along the curve describe the tradeoff between the goods. The sacrifice in the production of the second good is called the opportunity cost (because increasing production of the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second). Opportunity cost is measured in the number of units of the second good forgone <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more units of the first good.|$|E

A site was chosen in the Salt Wells Valley and work {{commenced}} on 80 buildings, 52 of them permanent, at a cost of $13 million. Groves wanted the plant working within 100 days. While Site S had sufficient capacity to make explosive components <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two bombs, it was unlikely that it could meet the expected demand in the months to come.

5|$|In 1934, {{his wife}} Badia'a died and al-Hajj Muhammad {{was left with}} his four sons. With the killing of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, a Muslim revivalist preacher and anti-colonial militant by British forces, {{tensions}} between the Palestinian Arab population, among whom al-Qassam was popular, and the authorities rose significantly. His sympathizers grew in number {{and the notion of}} armed struggle against British rule and British sponsorship of Zionism became increasingly popular {{as an alternative to the}} diplomatic negotiations between the Palestinian leadership and the British government. The negotiations were ultimately seen by the local population as a futile effort that bore no tangible results. When al-Hajj Muhammad actively took part in the upcoming revolt, he entrusted his children with his sister Halima, a widow. According to his eldest son Kamal, she too was a grain merchant, who later traded in textiles. She also financially supported the children's education. Al-Hajj Muhammad would normally meet with his sons <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two days in different villages. His children would be escorted to his location by one of al-Hajj Muhammad's rebels.|$|E

5|$|The adult {{stage of}} a caddisfly may only survive for a few weeks; many species do not feed as adults and die soon after breeding, but some species are known to feed on nectar. The winged insects are nocturnal and provide food for night-flying birds, bats, small mammals, {{amphibians}} and arthropods. The larval stage lasts much longer, often <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more years, and has a bigger impact on the environment. They form {{an important part of}} the diet of fish such as the trout. The fish acquire them by two means, either plucking them off vegetation or the stream-bed as the larvae move about, or during the daily behavioural drift; this drift happens during the night for many species of aquatic larvae, or around midday for some cased caddisfly species, and may result from population pressures or be a dispersal device. The larvae may drift in great numbers either close to the bottom, in mid-water or just below the surface. The fish swallow them whole, case and all.|$|E
5|$|The red-backed fairywren mainly eats insects, and {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} seed and small fruit. The preferred habitat is heathland and savannah, particularly where low shrubs and tall grasses provide cover. It can be nomadic {{in areas where}} there are frequent bushfires, although pairs or small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year-round {{in other parts of}} its range. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with one or more helper birds who assist in raising the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity yet remain with the family group <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more years after fledging. The red-backed fairywren is sexually promiscuous, and each partner may mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Older males in breeding plumage are {{more likely to engage in}} this behaviour than are those breeding in eclipse plumage. As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks red petals from flowers and displays them to females.|$|E
5|$|The swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) {{feeds on}} the fallen fruit of P.lanceolata and disperses the seed through its scat (dung). A field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that 88% of {{seeds in the}} scat were still viable {{although}} dormant. The red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) feeds on drupes and is a likely seed dispersal agent. Animals can convey seed <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two kilometres from where they have fed. Rodents such as the bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) and black rat (Rattus rattus) eat the drupes but chew the seed so that only fragments leave their digestive system. Foxes {{have been reported to}} eat the fruit, and kangaroos and large birds such as currawongs are thought to as well.|$|E
