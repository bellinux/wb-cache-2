40|$|Xerosicyos danguyi Humbert (Cucurbitaceae) is a leaf {{succulent}} {{endemic to}} Madagascar. Under well-watered conditions, the plant exhibited Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) but shifted to a <b>dampened</b> <b>form</b> of CAM, CAM-idling, when subjected to water stress. The {{purpose of this}} investigation was {{to examine the effects of}} a shift in carbon metabolism on phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and on NADP-malic enzyme in X. danguyi. Experiments were conducted to determine the diurnal patterns of enzyme activity and pH optima of both enzymes, as well as the approximate molecular mass, kinetic patterns, malate inhibition, and glucose- 6 -phosphate stimulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. The two enzymes extracted from well-watered and water-stressed plants were similar in most parameters investigated; thus, CAM-idling appeared to be only a <b>dampened</b> <b>form</b> of CAM photosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{concerns}} {{the extension of}} a weak <b>form</b> of the <b>Rolle's</b> theorem to locally convex spaces that satisfy an axiom of separation. The result provides a condition for asserting the uniqueness of a solution to nonlinear functional equations, including nonlinear integro-differential equations. We use the extended Rolle's theorem to prove the uniqueness of a solution to a nonlinear, fractional differential equation...|$|R
40|$|A new derivative, called {{deformable}} derivative, {{is introduced}} here which {{is equivalent to}} ordinary derivative {{in the sense that}} one implies other. The deformable derivative is defined using limit approach like that of ordinary one but with respect to a parameter varying over unit interval. Thus it could also be regarded as a fractional derivative. Reason of calling it as deformable derivative is because of its intrinsic property of continuously deforming function to derivative. This is substantiated by its linear connection to function and its derivative. Besides discussing some of its basic properties, we discover the <b>forms</b> of <b>Rolle's,</b> Mean Value and Taylor's theorems. The fundamental theorem of calculus for this fractional derivative could be taken as definition of its fractional integral. As a theoretical application some fractional differential equations are solved...|$|R
50|$|What A Pleasure, {{trained by}} Edward Albert Neloy, would peak as a {{juvenile}} winning the National Stallion Stakes {{in the summer}} of his two-year-old season.In August of that same year he would run second in the Monmouth Park Sapling Stakes in preparation for the Hopeful Stakes later in that same month. He would win this showing and it is considered his best performance. What A Pleasure would go on to race as a three-year-old and ran a decent third in the Gotham Stakes, but he never regained his two-year-old form. Richard Ulbrich of ‘Peerage of Racehorses’ claims the colt had wrenched his hip after his victory in the Hopeful and this may have <b>dampened</b> his <b>form</b> as a three-year-old. He was retired to stud in 1969 at Florida's Waldemar Farms.|$|R
40|$|Xerosicyos danguyi H. Humb. (Cucurbitaceae) is a Crassulacean acid {{metabolism}} (CAM) species {{native to}} Madagascar. Previously, {{it was shown}} that when grown under good water conditions, it is a typical CAM plant, but when water stressed, it shifts to a <b>dampened</b> <b>form</b> of CAM, termed CAM-idling, in which stomata are closed day and night but with a continued, low diurnal organic acid fluctuation. We have now studied the kinetics of some metabolic features of the shift from CAM to CAM-idling under severe water stress and the recovery upon rewatering. When water is withheld, there is a steady decrease in relative water content (RWC), reaching about 50 %, {{at which point the}} water potential decreases precipitously from about - 2 or - 3 bars to - 12 bars. Abscisic acid (ABA) increases sharply at about 75 % RWC. Stomata close, which limits CO 2 uptake, and there is a dampened diurnal organic acid fluctuation typical of CAM-idling. Throughout an extended stress period to 50 % RWC, there is no change in chlorophyll, protein, and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase activity compared with the well-watered plants. Despite the fact that the tissue was already in CAM, the stress is accompanied by an increase in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc) mRNA, extractable PEPc activity, and PEPc protein (such that the specific activity remained approximately constant) and a decrease in the apparent Km(PEP). It is not known if the changes in Km(PEP) in response to drought are related to or are separate from the increases in PEPc protein and mRNA. The changes in Km(PEP) could be in response to the decreased endogenous levels of organic acids, but evidently are not an assay artifact. The increases in PEPc protein and mRNA appear {{to be related to the}} water-stress treatment and may result from the increased concentration of ABA or the decreased levels of endogenous organic acids. When rewatered, the metabolism quickly returns to the well-watered control typical of CAM...|$|R

40|$|Decentralization is {{increasing}} {{in all parts}} of the world. Assessing the efficiency of decentralization as a means to mitigate ethnic conflict is then of primarily importance. This paper builds a simple model of decentralization as an empowerment mechanism. It suggests that decentralization could promote peace conditional on a set of countries and groups characteristics. Typically, decentralization should empower minorities which are small at the national level, while representing a critical mass of the population in the regions they live in. Empirical results confirm that decentralization impacts ethnic conflict only when those conditioning factors are controlled for. Furthermore, decentralization <b>dampens</b> all <b>forms</b> of ethnic violence for groups spatially concentrated enough and/or for groups having a local majority. In contrast, it fuels protest and even rebellion for groups lacking one. The paper then highlights the crucial need to build checks and balances mechanisms at the regional level for local minorities not being harmed by the decentralization process. ...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{buckskin}} was a {{most important}} material used for clothing, boots, moccasins, house covers and storage. Women prepared the hides {{and many of the}} products made from it. They scraped the hides to remove all fur, then left them outside to freeze. The next step was to stretch the hide on a frame. They rubbed it with a mixture of animal brain and pine needle tea to soften it. The <b>dampened</b> hide was <b>formed</b> into a ball and left overnight. In the morning, it would be stretched again, then placed over a smoker to smoke and tan it. The hide was left overnight. The finished hide was called buckskin.|$|R
5000|$|The three {{versions}} of Life of Soul appear each {{in a single}} manuscript: version L in the Bodleian Library (Oxford) manuscript Laud Misc. 210, folios 114r-132v; version A in the British Library (London) manuscript Arundel 286, folios 115r-129r; and version H in the Huntington Library (California) manuscript HM 502, folios 35r-60v. Version L is the most complete; version H has some material not in L, which may be original, or may represent expansions; and version A is a severely abridged version. The manuscripts in which all three appear are all orthodox compilations of devotional material, in L and H often material of lay interest. [...] "L," [...] for example, includes Book to a Mother, <b>Rolle's</b> <b>Form</b> of Living, the Sixteen Points of Charity, and The Abbey of the Holy Ghost, another tract that (as Gillespie says) [...] "is intended for people seeking a 'relygyon of the herte'"; [...] "H," [...] Rolle again and St. Edmund's Mirror; and [...] "A," [...] the manuscript likely intended for a monastic audience, a commendation of virginity, several pseudo-Rolle works largely Anselmian or Victorine in origin, a tract on the ten commandments, {{and a set of}} contemplations on the liturgical hours. Aside from the differences of personnel and audience mentioned above, the three versions differ somewhat in the dialect of their English. The text's sole editor (Moon) locates versions L and H in the London area or points south, A farther north and west (and calls it perhaps a little more recent than the others). But the Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English locates the scribal practices of both A and H in Warwickshire.|$|R
