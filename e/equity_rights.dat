40|$|Those {{concerned}} with poverty and health have sometimes viewed <b>equity</b> and human <b>rights</b> as abstract concepts with little practical application, and links between health, <b>equity</b> and human <b>rights</b> {{have not been}} examined systematically. Examination of the concepts of poverty, <b>equity,</b> and human <b>rights</b> in relation to health and to each other demonstrates that they are closely linked conceptually and operationally and that each provides valuable, unique guidance for health institutions' work. <b>Equity</b> and human <b>rights</b> perspectives can contribute concretely to health institutions' efforts to tackle poverty and health, and focusing on poverty is essential to operationalizing those commitments. Both <b>equity</b> and human <b>rights</b> principles dictate the necessity to strive for equal opportunity for health for groups {{of people who have}} suffered marginalization or discrimination. Health institutions can deal with poverty and health within a framework encompassing <b>equity</b> and human <b>rights</b> concerns in five general ways: (1) institutionalizing the systematic and routine application of <b>equity</b> and human <b>rights</b> perspectives to all health sector actions; (2) strengthening and extending the public health functions, other than health care, that create the conditions necessary for health; (3) implementing equitable health care financing, which should help reduce poverty while increasing access for the poor; (4) ensuring that health services respond effectively to the major causes of preventable ill-health among the poor and disadvantaged; and (5) monitoring, advocating and taking action to address the potential health <b>equity</b> and human <b>rights</b> implications of policies in all sectors affecting health, not only the health sector...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{cross-cultural}} {{variation in}} the perception of impoliteness. It is based on 500 impoliteness events reported by students in England, China, Finland, Germany, and Turkey. The main analytical framework adopted is Spencer-Oatey’s (e. g. 2000) “rapport management,” covering various types of face as well as sociality rights. We offer some clarifications of this framework, and explain and demonstrate how it can be operationalized for quantitative analysis. In general, it offers a good account of our data, though accommodating ambiguous cases proved to be a major challenge. Our quantitative analysis suggests that three of the five categories of Spencer-Oatey’s framework are key ones, namely, quality face, <b>equity</b> <b>rights,</b> and association rights. Furthermore, differences between our geographically separated datasets emerge. For example, the England-based data has a preponderance of impoliteness events in which quality face is violated, whereas the China-based data has a preponderance where <b>equity</b> <b>rights</b> are violated. We offer some explanations for these differences, relating them where possible to broader cultural issues...|$|E

Self-insurance is generally regarded to be relatively costless, but we provide evidence from Singapore that is consistent with the existence of implicit costs. In particular, the existence of self-insurance costs implies that firms with better projects will have larger discounts and that firms with higher ownership concentration will have more precommitments. Hence, our results support costly self-insurance against issue failure as a factor in explaining the rights issue paradox...|$|E

We use data for <b>equity</b> <b>rights</b> offerings - the widely adopted flotation method in the Netherlands.

Further stock price decline is also observed during the subscription period.

Additional investigation of both stock and operating performance decline provides full support for the information asymmetry hypothesis, partial support for the free cash flow hypothesis but no support for {{the window of opportunity}} hypothesis...|$|E

The announcement of equity issues has a positive abnormal return of 0. 45 %, significant at the 0. 10 level, but this positive abnormal return can be attributed to one year in our sample and is offset by a negative issue date abnormal return of - 1. 01 %. The abnormal returns are negatively related to firm size, so that for equity issues (but not for convertible debt issues), large Japanese firms have significant negative announcement abnormal returns. Our evidence is consistent with the view that Japanese managers decide to issue shares based on different considerations than American managers. ...|$|E

In section 2, we focus on the privatisation/commoditisation of health care, giving attention to the status of universal health coverage in select Southeast Asian countries as well as the growth in transborder flows of investment/ownership and health care provision/pursuits. Section 3 is dedicated to questions of vulnerability, health <b>equity,</b> <b>rights</b> and justice.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{long-term}} equity performance of Japanese firms issu-ing convertible debt and equity. We find that issuing firms perform poorly (except for <b>equity</b> <b>rights</b> issues) compared to nonissuing firms {{even though the}} stock-price reaction to convertible debt and equity issues is not negative for Japanese firms. This underperformance is strongest for firms issuing public convertible debt. In contrast to the United States, poor performance is not concentrated in smaller firms and in firms with a high market-to-book ratio. Simple behavioral explanations advanced for the new issue puzzle in the United States do not seem consistent with the Japanese experience.

40|$|Tackling inequalities {{in health}} is an {{essential}} social work task. Every day, social workers grapple with the impact on people's lives of the social inequalities that shape their health chances and experience. This book examines the relationship between social work and health inequalities {{in the context of}} globalisation. Based on the practice expertise and research of social workers from developing and developed countries worldwide and using specific examples, this book: • demonstrates the relevance of health inequalities to social work practice and policy across the lifecourse; • analyses barriers to good health that result from global social, economic, environmental and political trends; • develops core ideas on how social workers can act to combat negative effects of globalisation by adopting a health inequalities lens. "Social work and global health inequalities" is a unique snapshot of a new global social work that is responsive to local conditions and circumstances but seeks partners in the international struggle for <b>equity,</b> <b>rights</b> and social justice.

40|$|Traditionally, {{the impacts}} {{of the rights of}} {{financial}} institutions and workers on corporate performance have been analyzed independently. Yet theory clearly indicates that it is the combination of (changes in) relative powers of different stakeholders that affects a firm overall performance. Using U.

We find that financial liberalization positively and greater workers ’ rights ambiguously impact overall state growth. In terms of channels, while the effect of financial liberalization does not differ across industries that vary in external financing dependency, employment protection promotes those industries that are more knowledge (skilled-labor and intangibles) -intensive. The results hold controlling for changes in shareholders ’ rights, which itself is not significant. They suggest that financial liberalization operates mostly through an efficiency channel (re-allocating resources better), while employment protection creates better incentives and encourages more sector-specific, human capital investments. Overall, the results show that the strength of stakeholders ’ protection affects performance through efficiency channels and provide support for a stakeholders ’ view of corporate governance...|$|E
