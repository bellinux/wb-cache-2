5|$|Silkworms, the {{caterpillars}} and pupae of {{the moth}} Bombyx mori, have been reared to produce silk in China from the Neolithic Yangshao period onwards, c. 5000 BC. Production spread to India by 140 AD. The caterpillars are fed on mulberry leaves. The cocoon, produced after the fourth moult, {{is covered with}} a continuous filament of the silk protein, fibroin, <b>gummed</b> together with sericin. In the traditional process, the gum is removed by soaking in hot water, and the silk is then unwound from the cocoon and reeled. Filaments are spun together to make silk thread. Commerce in silk between China and countries to its west began in ancient times, with silk known from an Egyptian mummy of 1070 BC, and later to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The silk road leading west from China was opened in the second century AD, helping to drive trade in silk and other goods.|$|E

By the mid-1970s, {{it was clear that}} <b>Gummed</b> Products Company had caused an explosion in election propaganda, restricted employee freedom of speech, increased litigation, and caused an increasingly large number of board decisions to be overturned by the courts. In 1977, the NLRB overturned <b>Gummed</b> Products Company in Shopping Kart Food Market. But after the appointment of more conservative members to the NLRB, Shopping Kart Food Market was overturned in 1979 in General Knit of California, Inc., which adopted the Hollywood Ceramics standard again. Four years later, General Knit was overturned by yet another new majority of the board and the Shopping Kart Food Market rule reinstated in Midland National Life Insurance Co.. Midland National Life Insurance was reaffirmed by the board in Goffstown Truck Center, Inc. in 2010.|$|E

25|$|A {{worldwide}} {{network of}} <b>gummed</b> film stations {{was established to}} monitor fallout following Operation Castle. Although meteorological data was poor, a general connection of tropospheric flow patterns with observed fallout was evident. There was a tendency for fallout/debris to remain in tropical latitudes, with incursions into the temperate regions associated with meteorological disturbances of the predominantly zonal flow. Outside of the tropics, the Southwestern United States received the greatest total fallout, about five times that received in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Preservation is {{a problem}} for fairyflies (and other small chalcid wasps). Their tiny sizes require special methods. Specimens have to be dried, if {{collected}} wet, e.g. if ethyl alcohol is used as the killing agent. Drying can make specimens extremely brittle, so additional care should also be taken not to disintegrate them. Mounting specimens (preferably in permanent slides) is also time-consuming and requires a fair amount of practice. They are <b>gummed</b> or glued onto cards, as they can not be mounted on pins like larger insects.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the January 1972 Campaign Z, and its two counters, Operation Strength and Operation Strength II, the strategic Lao guerrilla base at Long Tieng was at serious risk of capture by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) until the rainy season <b>gummed</b> up military operations. On 26 April, Royalist radio intercepts began reporting the withdrawal of the PAVN 312th Division as early as 26 April 1972. On 17 May 1972, the rains came. The 312th Division had been withdrawn from the Plain of Jars (PDJ) to fight in the Easter Offensive striking South Vietnam; this considerably weakened the Communist forces in northern Laos. The Vietnamese Communist supply lines began to literally bog down and wash out in the monsoon downpour.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the great}} {{diversity}} within this genus, as of 2017, comprehensive life-history studies of Amphidromus species are still lacking; {{only a few}} observations of behavior of species within the genus exist, and these observations are scattered throughout the literature. A study by Eugen Paravicini (1921) described egg-laying behaviour in Amphidromus palaceus var. pura at Palimanan, West Java. According to Paravicini's observations, in October, 1920, locals from West Java brought in two [...] "nests" [...] containing snails that had just begun depositing their eggs; one snail had folded the exterior leaves of a young bamboo shoot and <b>gummed</b> them together into a pointed cornet. The shoot hung vertically with the narrow end pointed upward, and the wide opening below. The {{upper part of the}} sack was filled with eggs when collected. The snail descended slowly, rotating around its longitudinal axis, and deposited eggs until the entire cavity was filled up. If a crack in the basket exposed eggs to the air, they quickly dried up. Two days after capture, egg-laying was finished, and the snail closed the opening by folding over more leaves. Probably four days were spent in egg-laying, since the cavity was half filled at the start of observations. A second nest of similarly folded mango leaves contained 234 eggs. The volume of eggs in each case greatly exceeded the size of the snail, indicating that the eggs must be encapsulated just before deposition. The capsules were very thin, and dried quickly upon any exposure to the air. October marked the start of the rainy season and probably this is the normal breeding period. Eggs of A. porcellanus were reported by van Benthem Jutting (1950, p.493) to have started hatching only ten days after being laid. Similar nest-building habits have been reported for other species, but no complete study of a life cycle has been published. Up until 1961, no information was available on the cycle of activity, longevity, rate of growth, etc.|$|E

2500|$|In 1954, the Farmer board also {{overturned}} the NLRB's long-standing rule against employer interrogation of employees about protected union activities.

But in Blue Flash Express, the Farmer board held that all questioning was acceptable, absent any clearly coercive content (such as promises, threats, etc.).

2500|$|Lithography {{originally}} used {{an image}} drawn with oil, fat, or wax {{onto the surface}} of a smooth, level lithographic limestone plate. The stone was treated with a mixture of acid and gum arabic, [...] "etching" [...] the grease content of the drawing material into the pores of the stone and chemically creating grease reservoirs. The open stone (without drawing) was affected by the gum arabic creating a thin gum layer that would then attract water. When the stone was subsequently moistened, these <b>gummed</b> areas retained water; an oil-based ink could then be applied with a roller sticking only to the original drawing. The ink would finally be transferred to a cotton fine art paper sheet, producing a printed page. This traditional technique is still used as a fine art medium today.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few basic}} items of {{equipment}} {{are needed to}} collect stamps.

Issued in various sizes, these are clear chemically neutral thin plastic holders that open to receive stamps and are <b>gummed</b> on the back so that they stick to album pages. [...] Another alternative is a stockbook where the stamps drop into clear pockets without the need for a mount. Stamps should be stored away from light, heat and moisture or they will be damaged.|$|E

2500|$|The Pope Sixtus V had {{appointed}} the 3rd committee of scholars {{to continue the}} work. The committee was under the presidency of Cardinal Carafa. The work was prepared {{on the basis of}} the edition of Robertus Stephanus from Louvain (1583) and good manuscripts were used as authorities, including notably Codex Amiatinus. Carafa presented the result of their work, in the beginning of 1589, but Sixtus rejected their work and in 18 months prepared another text he corrected to agree with the Greek and Hebrew, He used Codex Carafianus, but it was hurried into print and suffered from many printing errors, as well as serious problems reflecting the inability of the headstrong Sixtus as a Bible scholar. Three whole verses were dropped from the Book of Numbers; Numbers 30:11-13, though it is unclear whether this was an error in printing, or a 'wild' editorial choice by Sixtus himself. In May 1590 the completed work was issued from the press in three volumes;, but even after printing, Sixtus continued to tinker with the text, sending out revised readings on <b>gummed</b> strips to be pasted over the printed pages. After his death Robert Bellarmine warned that this work was an embarrassment, and a great danger to the church.

In this study, rheological and interfacial properties of almond <b>gum</b> and <b>gum</b> arabic aqueous dispersions were comparatively investigated. The interfacial tension of almond <b>gum</b> and <b>gum</b> arabic aqueous dispersions was measured using the pendant drop method in hexadecane. The asymptotic interfacial tension values for almond <b>gum</b> were significantly lower than the corresponding values measured for <b>gum</b> arabic, especially at high concentration. Rheological properties were characterized by steady and oscillatory tests using a coaxial geometry. Almond <b>gum</b> flow curves exhibited a shear thinning non-Newtonian behavior with a tendency to a Newtonian plateau at low shear rate, while <b>gum</b> arabic flow curves exhibited such behavior only at high shear rate. The influence of temperature (5 - 50 [*][*]℃) on the flow curves was studied at 4 % (m/m) <b>gum</b> concentration and the Newtonian viscosities at infinite and at zero shear rate, for <b>gum</b> arabic and almond <b>gum,</b> respectively, were accurately fitted by an Arrhenius-type equation. The dynamic properties of the two <b>gum</b> dispersions were also studied. Both <b>gum</b> dispersions exhibited viscoelastic properties, with the viscous component being predominant in a wider range of concentrations for almond <b>gum,</b> while for <b>gum</b> arabic the elastic component being higher than the elastic one especially at higher concentrations.
