40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} an embedded control system for insulin pump. The insulin pump is an integrated component in any closed loop <b>insulin</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> for type 1 diabetes. The pump consists of three main components: micro-needles, insulin reservoir (syringe), and piezoelectric (PZT) linear servo motor. The actuated syringe has an injection back pressure that resists the linear motion of the driving PZT motor. This back pressure acts as a disturbance and leads to inaccurate position and consequently an imprecise insulin dosage. Therefore, a highly precise positioning control on the pump is required to control the insulin dosage and to maintain the blood glucose level in its safe range. The proposed controller is designed using fuzzy logic as a nonlinear controller to compensate any non-modeled nonlinearities in the system. The embedded controller for the PZT motor can be implemented using FPGA or microcontroller chip. This controller acts as a slave and responds to its master controller which controls the complete closed loop <b>insulin</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

The majority of the existing diabetes-specific measures are focused on insulin treatment and include concepts that are not applicable to treatment {{with most of the}} GLP- 1 RAs, such as dose selection and adjustment, measuring blood glucose or glycemic control, and planning food or physical activities around treatment. Examples of these instruments include the <b>Insulin</b> <b>Delivery</b> <b>System</b> Rating Questionnaire (IDSRQ) [9], the <b>Insulin</b> <b>Delivery</b> <b>System</b> Questionnaire (IDSQ) [29, 30], Insulin Injection Preference Questionnaire (IIP-Q) [10], the Insulin Pens Questionnaire – Evaluation (IPQ-E) [31]; Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) [7], Patient Satisfaction with Insulin Therapy (PSIT) [32, 33], Treatment-Related Impact Measures for Diabetes and Diabetes Devices (TRIM-D and TRIM-D Device) [8, 34]. Previously existing measures also omit concepts that could be important when assessing patient experiences with injection devices such as preparing the device/medication for use (missing from IPQ-E, ITSQ, and PSIT), confidence in providing the correct dose (missing from ITSQ, PSIT), the size of the needle (missing from IDSQ, IPQ-E, TRIM-D/TRIM-D Device), or the time to prepare and inject the medication (missing from IDSQ, IIP-Q, IPQ-E, ITSQ, TRIM-D/TRIM-D Device). More general instruments, such as the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) [35], are useful across a wide range of treatments, but may not include specific injection device characteristics. Importantly, none of these measures were developed based on perceptions of patients treated with GLP- 1 RAs, and therefore may not reflect the key features of these new treatments that are most important to patients treated with these newer injectable medications.|$|E

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} is treated with insulin, which {{has traditionally been}} delivered by vial and syringe.

This {{has contributed to the}} increased popularity of alternative <b>insulin</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems,</b> including pen <b>delivery</b> devices (4, 6). Evidence suggests that discreet devices, such as insulin pens, facilitate adherence to intensive insulin therapy regimens, help improve lifestyle flexibility, and reduce injection pain compared with the conventional syringe-based regimens, as shown in studies in adults and adolescents (7). In addition, compared with the vial and syringe method of insulin administration, pens may provide more accurate dosing - which is particularly important in children - thereby improving short-term blood glucose control and potentially improving long-term outcomes (5, 8). Children, in particular, may benefit from insulin pens that are simple to use as adherence issues may be more evident in this patient group (9).

40|$|Aim. Inadequately {{controlled}} diabetes {{accounts for}} chronic complications and increases mortality. Its therapeutic management aims in normal HbA 1 C, prandial and postprandial glucose levels. This review discusses diabetes management {{focusing on the}} latest insulin analogues, alternative <b>insulin</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> and the artificial pancreas. Results. Intensive insulin therapy with multiple daily injections (MDI) allows better imitation of the physiological rhythm of insulin secretion. Longer-acting, basal insulin analogues provide concomitant improvements in safety, efficacy and variability of glycaemic control, followed by low risks of hypoglycaemia. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) provides long-term glycaemic control especially in type 1 diabetic patients, while reducing hypoglycaemic episodes and glycaemic variability. Continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems provide information on postprandial glucose excursions and nocturnal hypo- and/or hyperglycemias. This information enhances treatment options, provides {{a useful tool for}} self-monitoring and allows safer achievement of treatment targets. In the absence of a cure-like pancreas or islets transplants, artificial &# 8220;closed-loop&# 8221; systems mimicking the pancreatic activity have been also developed. Conclusions.
