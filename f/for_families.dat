A recreation of Hagrid's Hut is passed on the way for a lesson from Hagrid himself on how to properly approach a hippogriff.|$|E

40|$|In several African {{countries}} fertility {{levels have}} stagnated or increased slightly. However, many women still report an unmet need <b>for</b> <b>family</b> planning. Therefore achieving further fertility declines requires programs that increase demand <b>for</b> <b>family</b> planning, {{but that also}} address the existing unmet need. One way to improve contraceptive access in a cost-effective manner might be to integrate family planning services into other existing health services. This paper analyzes secondary data from the 2012 – 2013 Millennium Development Goals (MDG) survey in Madagascar to estimate {{the number of women}} with an unmet need <b>for</b> <b>family</b> planning that might benefit from integrating family planning services into other health services. In Madagascar, one third of the demand <b>for</b> <b>family</b> planning is not met; an estimated 820, 000 women have an unmet need <b>for</b> <b>family</b> planning. A substantial portion of these women can be reached by integrating family planning services into existing maternal and child health services. Health providers are uniquely positioned to help address method-related reasons <b>for</b> non-use of <b>family</b> planning, such as concerns about health problems and side-effects. Given the large unmet need <b>for</b> <b>family</b> planning, programs should not exclusively focus on increasing the demand <b>for</b> <b>family</b> planning, but also seek new ways to address the existing unmet need. Our study illustrates that simple analyses of existing health survey data can be an important tool for informing the design of programs to tackle this unmet need...|$|R

5|$|IWGC war cemeteries {{featured}} {{grass and}} flowers within a walled area, intended to resemble an English garden; almost all were constructed around a War Stone and a Cross of Sacrifice, described {{in more detail}} below. The style varied slightly by architect and location, but typically the cemeteries followed classical influences in buildings and monuments, sometimes adapted slightly to appeal to the style of a particular Dominion. The buildings at the cemeteries were important symbolically and formed a key part of these designs. The graves proved controversial: initially they were marked by wooden crosses but, after some argument, it was agreed to replace these with Portland stone markers; the original wooden memorials were in some cases returned to the soldier's next of kin. Each marker was identical in shape and individualised only through the inscription of the name, regiment, date of death, a religious symbol and a short text agreed by the next of kin. Public debate ensued about these graves throughout the 1920s. British officials were concerned about families erecting their own memorials on the sites and detracting from the appearance of the cemeteries; critics complained about the secular nature of the memorials, the limited options <b>for</b> <b>families</b> to individualise the graves and the excessive role of the IWGC in determining how the soldiers were buried.|$|E
