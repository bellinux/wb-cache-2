500|$|To avoid a {{scheduling}} {{conflict with}} Revolutionary Road, Winslet {{turned down an}} offer to star in The Reader. After her replacement Nicole Kidman left the project due to her pregnancy, Winslet was signed to it. Directed by Stephen Daldry, The Reader is based on Bernhard Schlink's novel {{of the same name}} and is about Hanna Schmitz, an illiterate Nazi camp guard (Winslet), who has an affair with a teenage boy. Winslet researched on the Holocaust and the SS guards, and was traumatised by what she learnt. To educate herself on the stigma attached to illiteracy, she spent time with students at the Literacy Partners, an organisation that teaches adults to read and write. A merkin was designed for her frontal nude scenes, but she refused to wear it. Winslet was unable to sympathise with Schmitz, saying that [...] "there was nothing of her that I could relate to", and struggled to find [...] "honesty and truthfulness" [...] to the part without humanising her actions. Despite this, certain historians criticised the film for making Schmitz an object of audience's sympathy and accused the filmmakers of <b>Holocaust</b> <b>revisionism.</b> Even so, Winslet's performance was acclaimed; the critic Todd McCarthy commended her for supplying [...] "a haunting shell to this internally decimated woman", and writing for The Daily Telegraph, Sukhdev Sandhu considered her to be [...] "absolutely fearless here, not just in her willingness to expose herself physically, but her refusal to expose her character psychologically".|$|E

2500|$|During Minnesota's 2006 DFL primary for Minnesota's 5th District {{seat in the}} United States House of Representatives the Twin Cities-based {{publication}} American Jewish World endorsed Keith Ellison citing {{his work}} during the ethics complaint {{as one of their}} reasons. [...] They wrote [...] "Ellison acted as the lawyer for the House DFL caucus in an ethics proceeding against former representative Arlon Lindner, who contended that gays were not victims of Nazi oppression in the Holocaust. [...] Ellison understands the importance of guarding against <b>Holocaust</b> denial and <b>revisionism,</b> and links the lessons of the Shoah to more recent cases of genocide in Rwanda and Darfur." [...] The Ellison campaign called this an [...] "extremely valued and valuable endorsement", and Ellison said [...] "I am humbled, and just plain thrilled, by the confidence the American Jewish World has placed in my vision of a just future where there are no throw-away people and peace is our guiding principle. ...This is how we will win – by creating a powerful force of real people unified behind a passion for justice." [...] The Minnesota Monitor described the endorsement's influence on the race as a [...] "bombshell".|$|R

50|$|The group began life in 1966 ostensibly as {{a society}} for the {{appreciation}} of Richard Wagner but before long it {{had taken on a}} neo-Nazi dimension, influenced by the likes of Otto Skorzeny, who was a founding member. Counting Léon Degrelle among its leading members, the Circle became a study group and publishing house for materials relating to Nazism and <b>Holocaust</b> <b>Revisionism,</b> with a remit towards closer co-operation across Europe. Initially led by Ángel Ricote, the group looked towards Italian fascism for inspiration, but under Pedro Aparicio it moved towards a Nazi position.|$|E
40|$|The {{systematic}} philosophical {{foundation for}} Jean-François Lyotard's postmodern and post-Marxist politics is described. The central {{principle of the}} right to create different "phrases" is uncovered and examined. The political consequences of this philosophical system are explored, leading to the conclusion that Lyotard's commitment to difference leads to political indifference. The philosophical roots of this indifference are detailed in Lyotard's Cartesian starting point and his analysis of <b>Holocaust</b> <b>revisionism.</b> This analysis reveals an idealist basis to Lyotard's philosophy of difference. Lyotard's concept of difference is compared to that of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe...|$|E
40|$|The War After (Karpf, 1996), {{a family}} memoir about the psycho-social {{effects of the}} Holocaust on the {{children}} of survivors, attracted considerable attention when first published. 20 years later, Karpf argues, it {{can be read as}} an example of post-postmemory. Hirsch (2012) defined postmemory as those memories of the Holocaust that the 'second generation' had of events that shaped their lives but took place before they were born. Post-postmemory, Karpf suggests, is the process whereby such narratives are themselves modified by subsequent events and re-readings brought about by three kinds of time - personal, historical and discursive. Although inevitable, such re-readings run the risk of encouraging <b>Holocaust</b> <b>revisionism</b> and denial. Nevertheless, Karpf claims, they are essential to maintain the post-memoir as a living text...|$|E
