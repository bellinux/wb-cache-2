As {{the number of}} subscribers grew, multiple exchanges served individual neighborhoods of large cities. A city telephone number consisted of an exchange name and four digits, such as [...] "Pennsylvania 5000". A rural telephone number, often party line, was often up to four digits plus a letter or letter and digits to indicate which of the multiple parties on the line was desired.|$|R

40|$|An {{integral}} {{component of}} a language-based augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) system is providing vocabulary typical of fluent native language speakers. In the absence of reliable and valid research on Malay vocabulary for AAC, this descriptive study explored the validation process of vocabulary selection and organization for a 144 -location <b>manual</b> communication <b>board.</b> An hour of aided language samples (talking while pointing to a prototype display) followed by self-administered surveys were gathered from four typical native Malay speakers (n= 4), aged between 22 to 36 years at the University of Pittsburgh. Vocabulary frequency analysis, word commonality, and overall perceptions and feedback on the prototype display were compiled and analyzed. A total of 1112 word tokens and 454 word types were analyzed to support preliminary validation of the selected vocabulary and word organization of the prototype. Approximately 40 % of {{the words on the}} display were used during the interview and the top 20 words were reported. Findings also suggest the importance of morphology and syntax considerations at early design stages. The positive overall perception of the display including vocabulary selection, the cultural and ethnicity appropriateness, and suggestions for system improvement were confirmed by the usability survey. Minimal rearrangement of the icon display needs to be performed to improve the usability of the system. Thus, the study findings support the early Malay <b>manual</b> communication <b>board</b> for AAC intervention. However, the limitation of the sample size and additional research is required to support a final display that optimizes vocabulary and morphosyntactic organization of a <b>manual</b> communication <b>board</b> in Malay...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Patient status boards play an {{important}} role in coordinating and communi-cating about patient care in hospital emergency departments (EDs). Status boards are transitioning from dry-erase whiteboards to electronic systems. Although electronic systems may preserve some surface features of the manual artifacts, important affor-dances of the manual technology are not always maintained. We compared informa-tion on manual and electronic status boards in an ED. Photographs of the <b>manual</b> <b>board</b> and screen shots of the electronic system were obtained before and after a hos-pital transitioned between systems. Displayed information as well as detailed content regarding patient chief complaints, clinical plans, and dispositions were coded and analyzed to understand the type and function of information present, as well as the use of features such color. Results indicated that although categories of information found were similar, the frequency with which some types of information appeared on the two system displays was substantially different. In particular, information used to coordi-nate aspects of patient treatment was more frequently found in the manual system. Results suggest that in the design of new information technologies, simply matching the format or information fields available on an existing system may not be sufficient to sustain current work practices or to prevent unanticipated shifts in use...|$|R

The 2012 CA MUTCD supersedes the previously adopted January 21, 2010, edition.
