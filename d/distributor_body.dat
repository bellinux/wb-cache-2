5000|$|The 3.6 was {{the first}} AJ6 engine, debuting in 1983 on the XJ-S. It had DOHC 4-valve heads with a 91 mm bore and 92 mm stroke. Power was [...] with 325 Nm of torque. Power was reduced to [...] for {{versions}} having catalytic exhaust system. Early versions of the 3.6L AJ6 as used in the 1984 - 1987 XJ-S cars had a conventional distributor type of ignition system with electronics within the <b>distributor</b> <b>body.</b> This early AJ6 ignition system is nearly identical to the system used on the XK engine in the Series III XJ6 cars. The Lucas fuel injection system on the 3.6L AJ6 engines in these early XJ-S cars sensed engine load using a Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor just like the V12 cars from the same era. Later 3.6L AJ6 engines as used in the 1986-1989 XJ40 cars had a crank-sensor type of ignition system with a bare distributor that only carried the spinning ignition rotor inside the distributor cap. The fuel-injection system used on the later 3.6L AJ6 engines used a hot-wire Mass Air Flow sensor to determine engine load.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice in}} HEI system type is vitally {{important}} based on the engine {{it will be used}} with. Each GM division had its own engine design. Thus, a Chevrolet ignition may not be identical to an Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick, or Cadillac engine. Typically, the ignition system compatibility followed the engine size. Most GM engines (of the same size) between 1974 and 1988 used a similar distributor ignition system. The module type is important as well. For non-computer controlled carburetor engines, the 4-pin unit is used since it uses mechanical timing controls (vacuum and centrifugal advance). The 5-pin module is like the 4-pin, with an added knock/detonation sensor input to the module so the ignition could be deliberately retarded and the power output dropped to the spark plug to aid disruption of the knock condition. The 7-pin module is designed for computer timing controls. It incorporates 2 magnetic signals from the pickup sensor, and 3 signals shared with the ECM engine control module), while the remaining 2 pins provide signal and power to the coil. Normally the 7 pin is not used on non-computerized engines since it does not contain mechanical timing controls, but some early designs used a seven-pin distributor module in conjunction with mechanical and vacuum advance in the <b>distributor</b> <b>body,</b> so the seven-pin module would be backward compatible.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the late}} twenties {{through the late}} thirties, Raulang's [...] "woodie" [...] bodies were built for other chassis in {{addition}} to Ford. Available through independent automobile dealers and commercial <b>body</b> <b>distributors,</b> Raulang woodies enjoyed the same good reputation as their carriages and electric automobiles had years earlier. Series-built bodies were also produced in small quantities for other manufacturers such as the 100 built for Packard in 1937.|$|R

In 1998, while attending Stuyvesant High School, Koon launched Extreme Performance Motorsports, a company that imported car tuning accessories from Asia. By age 16, Koon had opened wholesale accounts with Asian auto <b>distributors</b> importing custom <b>body</b> kits, aftermarket wheels and rims, stereo systems, and other specialized accessories. In Bloomberg Businessweek Magazine, Koon describes the import movement and culture to [...] "a virus that spread." [...] Koon's business became one of the main suppliers of Pimp My Ride.|$|R
40|$|Organic {{farming and}} fair trade {{certified}} chains {{have emerged in}} West-Africa since the 1990 s in answer to new alternative markets in developed countries. These chains, involving actors from North and South, are seen {{as an opportunity to}} sustainably valorise the small peasants agriculture in Africa and include the smallholders in global markets. Certification and labelling systems accompany these chains in developed countries. The aim {{of this article is to}} analyze the challenges for smallholders of this new North- South trade regime established by certificates and labels. This article uses the theory of Global Value Chains as theoretical framework. The empirical framework consists of four cases (organic sesame; organic- fair sesame; fair cotton and organicfair cotton) in Mali and in Belgium and France. It focuses on data that are gathered during our inquiry based on a questionnaire with the chains stakeholders in the south and in the north. The chains upstream inquiry was conducted in Mali with individuals producers, producers organizations, exporters; and the downstream inquiry was conducted in Belgium and France with European importers, <b>distributors</b> and certifications <b>bodies.</b> The results show that the new North- South regime established by organic and fair certificates and labels has a potential impact on the negotiation power and value distribution between chain participants. Lack of adequate local institutions in Southern countries, and increasing complexity of the “cahiers de charges” imposed by the North however may cause exclusion of many smallholders in these new North-South trade networks. organic farming, Fair Trade, smallholders, North-South trade, Certificates, Labels, Global markets, Value chains, certification scheme, local institution, Agribusiness, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
