In this paper, a prototype clinical <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> application is described that combines free text and structured <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> in one single application and allows clinicians to smoothly switch between these two different input styles. A knowledge base involving a semantic network of clinical <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> terms and their properties and relationships is used by this application to support structured <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> From structured <b>data,</b> sentences are generated and shown in a text processor together with the free text.

One of the predominant responsibilities of the customers in the context of self-service is to enter their data on their own.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} conditions under which Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is an efficient choice for <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> In particular the focus was on <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> tasks that are part of constructing military messages. The ADF Formatted Messaging System utilises a structured formatting system to constrain the semantics of a message but also includes a field for unlimited and unstructured text. Hence the <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> tasks involved range from form-filling to free dictation of short phrases. In the experiments, ASR and manual input modes are compared for three <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> tasks: textual phrase entry, selection from a list, and numerical <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> To effect fair comparisons, the tasks minimised the transaction cycle for each input mode and data type and the main comparisons use only times from correct <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> The results indicate that for inputting short phrases ASR only competes if the typist's speed is below 45 wpm. For selecting an item from a list, ASR offered an advantage only if the list length was greater than 15 items. For entering numerical data, ASR offered no advantage over keypad or mouse. The general conclusion for formatted <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> is that a keyboard/mouse interface designed to match the data to be entered will be more time efficient than any equivalent ASR interface...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Use of {{electronic}} health record (EHR) systems can place a considerable <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> burden upon {{the emergency department}} (ED) physician. Voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> has been proposed as one mechanism to mitigate some of this burden; however, no reports are available specifically comparing emergency physician (EP) time use or number of interruptions between typed and voice recognition data entry-based EHRs. We designed this study to compare physician time use and interruptions between an EHR system using typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> versus an EHR with voice recognition. Methods: We collected prospective observational data at 2 academic teaching hospital EDs, one using an EHR with typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> {{and the other with}} voice recognition capabilities. Independent raters observed EP activities during regular shifts. Tasks each physician performed were noted and logged in 30 second intervals. We compared time allocated to charting, direct patient care, and change in tasks leading to interruptions between sites. Results: We logged 4, 140 minutes of observation for this study. We detected no statistically significant differences in the time spent by EPs charting (29. 4 % typed; 27. 5 % voice) or the time allocated to direct patient care (30. 7 %; 30. 8 %). Significantly more interruptions per hour were seen with typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> versus voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> (5. 33 vs. 3. 47; p= 0. 0165). Conclusion: The use of a voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> system versus typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> did not appear to alter the amount of time physicians spend charting or performing direct patient care in an ED setting. However, we did observe a lower number of workflow interruptions with the voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> EHR. Additional research is needed to further evaluate the <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> burden in the ED and examine alternative mechanisms for chart entry as EHR systems continue to evolve.

Participants also reported their perceived forearm discomfort during <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> and recovery.

UltraSTAR introduces collaborative reporting, in which nonmedical and medical staff collaborate to produce a single report for each patient visit. Performance of UltraSTAR was measured as user satisfaction, <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> time, report completeness, free text annotation rate, and referring-physician satisfaction with reports. Results show high satisfaction with UltraSTAR among radiologists and acceptance of the system among ultrasound technicians. <b>Data</b> <b>entry</b> times averaged 5. 3 minutes per report.

40|$|Theory {{building}} in nursing and midwifery both {{to explain and}} inform practice is important to advance these professions via provision of a theoretical foundation. This research explored the process of perinatal <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> undertaken by midwives to explore {{the impact of the}} movement from paper to computer collection of data. Use of grounded theory methodology enabled theory building, leading to a theoretical understanding of the phenomenon and development of the Theory of Beneficial Engagement grounded in the data. Methods involved in-depth semistructured interviews with 15 users of perinatal data systems. Participants were recruited from 12 different healthcare locations and were utilizing three different electronic systems for <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> The research question that guided the study focused on examining the influences of using the computer for perinatal <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> Findings indicated that qualities particular to some midwives denoted engagement with perinatal <b>data</b> <b>entry,</b> suggesting a strong desire to enter complete, timely, and accurate data. The Theory of Beneficial Engagement provides a model of user engagement with systems for perinatal <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> consistent with other theories of engagement.

40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} and scientific usage of patient-reported outcome measures is increasing {{in the health}} services. Often paper forms are used. Manual double <b>entry</b> of <b>data</b> {{is defined as the}} definitive gold standard for transferring data to an electronic format, but the process is laborious. Automated forms processing may be an alternative, but further validation is warranted. Methods: 200 patients were randomly selected from a cohort of 5777 patients who had previously answered two different questionnaires. The questionnaires were scanned using an automated forms processing technique, as well as processed by single and double manual <b>data</b> <b>entry,</b> using the EpiData <b>Entry</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> program. The main outcome measure was the proportion of correctly entered numbers at question, form and study level. Results: Manual double-key <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> (error proportion per 1000 fields = 0. 046 (95 % CI: 0. 001 – 0. 258)) performed better than single-key <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> (error proportion per 1000 fields = 0. 370 (95 % CI: 0. 160 – 0. 729), (p = 0. 020)).
