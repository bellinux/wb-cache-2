5|$|Arable farming {{grew in the}} High Middle Ages and {{agriculture}} entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Unlike England, Scotland had no towns dating from Roman occupation. From the twelfth century there are records of burghs, chartered towns, which became major centre of crafts and trade. There are also Scottish coins, although English coinage probably remained more significant in trade, and {{until the end of}} the period barter was probably the most common form of exchange. Craft and industry remained relatively undeveloped before the end of the Middle Ages and, although there were extensive trading networks based in Scotland, while the Scots exported largely raw materials, they imported increasing quantities of luxury goods, resulting in a bullion shortage and perhaps helping to create a financial crisis in the <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages the {{problems}} of schism in the Catholic Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established {{by the end of}} the <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Historians have discerned a decline in traditional monastic life in the late Middle Ages, but the mendicant orders of friars grew, particularly in the expanding burghs, emphasised preaching and ministering to the population. New saints and cults of devotion also proliferated. Despite problems over the number and quality of clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and evidence of heresy in the <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the Church in Scotland remained stable before the Reformation in the sixteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland was a cultural, {{intellectual}} and artistic movement in Scotland, {{from the late}} <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> {{to the beginning of}} the seventeenth century. It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late fourteenth century and reaching northern Europe as a Northern Renaissance in the <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b> It involved an attempt to revive the principles of the classical era, including humanism, a spirit of scholarly enquiry, scepticism, and concepts of balance and proportion. Since the twentieth century the uniqueness and unity of the Renaissance has been challenged by historians, but significant changes in Scotland can be seen to have taken place in education, intellectual life, literature, art, architecture, music and politics.|$|E

5|$|Crewkerne Castle was {{possibly}} a Norman motte castle on a mound to the north-west of the town, {{which is known}} as Castle Hill.

It later prospered as a coaching stop in the Georgian period.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh {{had emerged}} as the capital in the <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b> It was the wealthiest and largest city in the kingdom and held the central law courts, {{parliament}} and royal residence at Holyrood Palace. After James VI left for London at the Union of Crowns in 1603, it continued to be the centre of government. Even after the Acts of Union in 1707 removed the parliament, it retained the exchequer and law courts.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. By the <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> beginning in northern Italy, universities had become strongly influenced by Humanist thinking. This put an emphasis on classical authors, questioned some of the accepted certainties of established thinking and manifested itself in the teaching of new subjects, particularly through the medium of the Greek language. In the <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> university colleges had been founded at St John's College, St Andrews (1418) and St Salvator's College was added in 1450. Glasgow was founded in 1451 and King's College, Aberdeen in 1495. St Leonard's College was added at St. Andrews in 1511. Initially, they were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law.|$|E

5|$|Medieval vernacular {{architecture}} utilised local building materials, including cruck constructed houses, turf walls and clay, {{with a heavy}} reliance on stone. Medieval parish church architecture was typically simpler than in England, but there were grander ecclesiastical buildings in the Romanesque and Gothic styles. From the early <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the introduction of Renaissance styles included the selective use of Romanesque forms in church architecture, as in the nave of Dunkeld Cathedral. Castles arrived in Scotland {{with the introduction of}} feudalism in the twelfth century. Initially these were wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, but many were replaced by stone castles with a high curtain wall. In the late Middle Ages, new castles were built, some on a grander scale, and others, particularly in the borders, as simpler tower houses. Gunpowder weaponry led to the use of gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls adapted to resist bombardment. There was a phase of Renaissance palace building from the late <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> beginning at Linlithgow.|$|E
5|$|One {{effect of}} Jagiello's {{measures}} {{was to be}} the advancement of Catholics in Lithuania at the expense of Orthodox elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the Orthodox boyars. As this process gained momentum, it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus' and Lithuanian identity in the <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

The students instead went to New Inn, and Strand Inn was absorbed into that Inn. Thomas Occleve was said to have studied at Strand Inn.|$|E

5|$|The Islamic {{principle}} of kafa'a discourages the marriages {{of women to}} men of differing religion or of inferior status. Neighbouring Muslim powers did not start to give their daughters in marriage to Ottoman princes until the <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> when they were seen to have grown in importance. This same principle meant that, while Ottoman men were free to marry Christian women, Muslim princesses were prevented from marrying Christian princes.|$|E
5|$|The {{council was}} a {{virtually}} full-time institution {{by the late}} <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> and surviving records from the period indicate it was critical in the working of royal justice. Nominally members of the council {{were some of the}} great magnates of the realm, but they rarely attended meetings. Most of the active members of the council for most of the late Medieval Period were career administrators and lawyers, almost exclusively university-educated clergy. The most successful of these moved on to occupy the major ecclesiastical positions in the realm as bishops and, {{towards the end of the}} period, archbishops. By the end of the <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> this group was being joined by increasing numbers of literate laymen, often secular lawyers, of which the most successful gained preferment in the judicial system and grants of lands and lordships. From the reign of James III onwards, the clerically dominated post of Lord Chancellor was increasingly taken by leading laymen.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the Renaissance on Scottish {{architecture}} {{has been seen as}} occurring in two distinct phases. First, from the early <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> the selective use of Romanesque forms in church architecture, to be followed by a second phase of more directly influenced Renaissance palace building from the late <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b> The re-adoption of low-massive church building with round arches and pillars, in contrast to the Gothic perpendicular style that was particularly dominant in England in the late Medieval era, may have been influenced by close contacts with Rome and the Netherlands, and may have been a conscious reaction to English forms in favour of continental ones. It {{can be seen in the}} nave of Dunkeld Cathedral, begun in 1406, the facade of St Mary's, Haddington from the 1460s and in the chapel of Bishop Elphinstone's Kings College, Aberdeen (1500–9). About forty collegiate churches were established in Scotland in late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Many, like Trinity College, Edinburgh, showed a combination of Gothic and Renaissance styles.|$|E
