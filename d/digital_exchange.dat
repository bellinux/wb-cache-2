25|$|The {{concepts}} of digital switching {{were developed by}} various labs in the United States and in Europe from the 1930s onwards. The first prototype digital switch was developed by Bell Labs {{as part of the}} ESSEX project while the first true <b>digital</b> <b>exchange</b> to be combined with digital transmission systems was designed by LCT (Laboratoire Central de Telecommunications) in Paris. The first digital switch to be placed into a public network was the Empress Exchange in London, England which was designed by the General Post Office research labs. This was a tandem switch that connected three Strowger exchanges in the London area. The first commercial roll-out of a fully digital local switching system was Alcatel's E10 system which began serving customers in Brittany in Northwestern France in 1972.|$|E
