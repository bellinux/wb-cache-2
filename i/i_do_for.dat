You can pick either, and treat this as a confession or an interview (never to be published) & enjoy a modicum of legal protection." [...] They talked about restricted material in general, then Manning made her first explicit reference to the leaks: [...] "This is what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> friends." [...] She linked to {{a section of the}} May 21, 2010, version of Wikipedia's article on WikiLeaks, which described the WikiLeaks release in March that year of a Department of Defense report on WikiLeaks itself. She added [...] "the one below that is mine too"; the section below in the same article referred to the leak of the Baghdad airstrike ("Collateral Murder") video. Manning said she felt isolated and fragile, and was reaching out to someone she hoped might understand.|$|E
500|$|The Canadian {{government}} declined Mitsui's {{offer of}} military service. [...] A series of Orders in Council in 1942 deprived Canadians of Japanese descent {{of their property}} and rights, culminating in Japanese-Canadian internment {{for the duration of}} the war. [...] The government confiscated the Mitsui family's 17-acre property and poultry facilities in Coquitlam and sold it off, compensating the family with an estimated one-third of its total value. [...] The RCMP took Mitsui and his daughter Lucy to Hastings Park for registration as an enemy alien. [...] Mitsui wore his military medals and when the registering official asked him, [...] "What can <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> you, Sarge?", Mitsui responded, [...] "What are you doing to me? I served my country. [...] You've taken everything away from me.... What are the good of my medals?" [...] He scattered his medals on the floor and table, and refused to wear them thereafter when they were returned to him. [...] He and his family were detained in a facility in Greenwood, British Columbia. [...] Mitsui later stated, [...] "I had complete confidence in the government that they wouldn't be doing anything to me because of being a veteran." [...] All the family could later retrieve was a samurai sword Mitsui's son George had buried.|$|E

2500|$|Craig's many covers {{included}} that of {{the infamous}} Crime SuspenStories #22, shown during the 1950s Senate hearings on juvenile delinquency. U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver asked EC publisher Bill Gaines whether he thought the cover, depicting an ax-wielding man holding a woman's severed head, was in good taste. Gaines responded, [...] "Yes, sir, <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>for</b> {{the cover of a}} horror comic"—a remark that became an oft-quoted example of comic books' alleged depravity. Ironically, Craig was one of the more wholesome EC artists, frequently choosing to show the reactions of characters rather than the horrific event itself.|$|E
2500|$|More {{detailed}} {{versions of}} the story largely alleged that Zhang Heng personally killed Emperor Wen by pounding his chest and breaking his ribs. [...] The advocates for the theory that Emperor Wen was killed on Emperor Yang's orders also pointed to other circumstantial evidence, including how immediately after Emperor Wen's death Emperor Yang took Consorts Chen and Cai as his concubines. [...] Further, after Zhang lost Emperor Yang's favors and eventually was executed in 612, Zhang lamented at the execution field, [...] "What did <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> him that I can expect to live long?" [...] The warden, apparently believing in the murder theory himself, immediately covered his ears to avoid hearing any details and had Zhang immediately executed. [...] They further pointed out how Liu Shu and Yuan Yan were exiled and Yang Yong executed immediately following Emperor Wen's death.|$|E

2500|$|As Headmaster of Choate, George St. John's chapel talks {{included}} a recurring phrase that was widely remembered by Choate alumni. In 2008, school archivist Judy Donald found the phrase in St. John's notebooks, and in 2011 journalist Chris Matthews published the discovery in his biography of JFK. St. John's phrase (borrowed from Harvard dean LeBaron Briggs) was, [...] "The youth who loves {{his alma mater}} will always ask not 'What can she do for me?' but 'What can <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> her?'" [...] Speculation {{that this was the}} original of JFK's inaugural address [...] "Ask not" [...] goes back {{at least as far as}} a 1966 Time magazine article, and several of JFK's Choate contemporaries noticed the echo in 1961. Kennedy graduated from Choate in 1935. In senior class polling for the yearbook (of which he was business manager), Kennedy was voted Most Likely to Succeed.|$|E
2500|$|Oppewall {{said of her}} career, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> {{a living}} is not {{dissimilar}} from what an actor does. I have {{a different set of}} tools, but it's the same process. The reason that it's fun to design sets is that it allows you to try on personalities that you'd never otherwise experience." [...] Gary Ross, director of Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, said of Oppewall, [...] "Jeannine doesn't suffer fools gladly, and she hasn't suffered me gladly when I've been a fool. She's fastidious, restrained and refined, and yet she has this impulsive side where she just takes off and chases butterflies." [...] Gary Hoblit, who directed the 1996 Oppewall-designed film Primal Fear, said he particularly appreciated her flexibility and versatility: [...] "While she may prefer a world in which less is more, she can still create an opulent and gooey world that is appropriate for someone unlike her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Randi {{has been}} accused of {{actually}} using [...] "psychic powers" [...] to perform acts such as spoon bending. According to James Alcock, at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller, a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud. Randi said: [...] "Yes, indeed, I'm a trickster, I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> a living. Everything I've done here was by trickery." [...] The professor shouted back: [...] "That's not what I mean. You're a fraud because you're pretending to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it." [...] A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell, a confirmed believer in psychic phenomena. When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal—by simple trickery—a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying: [...] "I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn't realize it." [...] Randi has consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.|$|E

2500|$|After filming {{ended on}} the series Mercy Peak, Bartolomei {{decided he would}} stay in New Zealand rather than {{returning}} to Australia and was offered {{the role of a}} new character – Craig Valentine on Shortland Street, who was set to undergo a steamy romance with the upcoming character Sarah Potts. Bartolomei decided to leave the soap in 2008, saying, [...] "It was a very difficult decision, from an actor's point of view it's not very often that you have the security that a job like Shortland Street provides. But after {{four and a half years}} I longed for a degree of anonymity again. I'm a very private person, and given what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> a job, the spectre of Shortland Street will invariably take that away from you." [...] The character was killed off in a dramatic gang storyline, something which producers at first thought would be [...] "unforgivable" [...] but which, due to Bartolomei's iinsistence on leaving, they went through with. Bartolomei said of the storyline, [...] "It's all a bit of fun and it's nice to see the characters away from the normal hospital setting and involved in something a little bit different," [...] and of the conclusion to Sarah and Craig's romance, [...] "That does get revisited but not in a stereotypical way. There is a great deal of resolution at the end for everyone concerned." ...|$|E
