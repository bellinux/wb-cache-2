In the (Semantic) Web, the existence or producibility of certain, consensually agreed or authoritative knowledge cannot be assumed, and criteria to judge the trustability and reputation of knowledge sources may not be given. These issues give rise to formalizations of web information which factor in heterogeneous and possibly inconsistent assertions and intentions, and make such heterogeneity explicit and manageable for reasoning mechanisms. Such approaches can provide valuable metaknowledge in contemporary application fields, like open or distributed ontologies, social software, ranking and recommender systems, and domains with a high amount of controversies, such as politics and culture. As an approach to this, we introduce a lean formalism for the Semantic Web which allows for the explicit representation of controversial individual and group opinions and goals by means of so-called social contexts, and optionally for the probabilistic belief merging of uncertain or conflicting statements. Doing so, our approach generalizes concepts such as provenance annotation and voting {{in the context of}} ontologies and other kinds of Semantic Web knowledgeThis work was partially funded by the <b>German</b> National <b>Research</b> <b>Foundation</b> DFG (Br 609 / 13 - 1, research project “Open Ontologies and Open Knowledge Bases”) and by the Spanish National Plan of R+D, project no.

40|$|ArticleCopyright © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015 Zymogen {{granules}} (ZG) are specialized organelles in the exocrine pancreas {{which allow}} digestive enzyme storage and regulated secretion. The molecular mechanisms of their biogenesis and the sorting of zymogens are still incompletely understood. Here, we investigated {{the role of}} proteoglycans in granule formation and secretion of zymogens in pancreatic AR 42 J cells, an acinar model system. Cupromeronic Blue cytochemistry and biochemical studies revealed an association of proteoglycans primarily with the granule membrane. Removal of proteoglycans by carbonate treatment led {{to a loss of}} membrane curvature indicating a supportive role in the maintenance of membrane shape and stability. Chemical inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis impaired the formation of normal electron-dense granules in AR 42 J cells and resulted in the formation of unusually small granule structures. These structures still contained the zymogen carboxypeptidase, a cargo molecule of secretory granules, but migrated to lighter fractions after density gradient centrifugation. Furthermore, the basal secretion of amylase was increased in AR 42 J cells after inhibitor treatment. In addition, irregular-shaped granules appeared in pancreatic lobules. We conclude that the assembly of a proteoglycan scaffold at the ZG membrane is supporting efficient packaging of zymogens and the proper formation of stimulus-competent storage granules in acinar cells of the pancreas. <b>German</b> <b>Research</b> FoundationPortuguese <b>Foundation</b> for Science and Technology (FCT...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} design of ObjectGlobe, a {{distributed}} and open query processor for Internet data sources. Today, data is published on the Internet via Web servers which have, if at all, very localized query processing capabilities. The goal of the ObjectGlobe project is to establish an open market place in which data and query processing capabilities can be distributed and used by any kind of Internet application. Furthermore, ObjectGlobe integrates cycle providers (i. e., machines) which carry out query processing operators. The overall picture {{is to make it}} possible to execute a query with [...] - in principle [...] -unrelated query operators, cycle providers and data sources. Such an infrastructure can serve as enabling technology for scalable e-commerce applications, e. g., B 2 B and B 2 C market places, to be able to integrate data and data processing operations {{of a large number of}} participants. One of the main challenges in {{the design of}} such an open system is to ensure privacy and security. We discuss the ObjectGlobe security requirements, show how basic components such as the optimizer and runtime system need to be extended, and present the results of performance experiments that assess the additional cost for secure distributed query processing.
