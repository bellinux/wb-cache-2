Benzema scored against the latter club in the Copa del Rey in each leg of the Round of 16. The 4–2 aggregate win advanced Real Madrid to the quarter-finals where the club faced Barcelona. After failing to score in the first leg, which ended 2–1 in favour of Barça, in the second leg on 25 January 2012, Benzema scored his third goal of the season against the Blaugrana, but Madrid failed to win the tie losing 4–3 on aggregate. On 12 February, Benzema scored his first league goal in over a month against Levante. A week later, he scored a double in a 4–0 shutout of Racing Santander. On 24 March, Benzema scored two goals in a league win over Real Sociedad. The two goals made him the top French scorer in La Liga history surpassing Zidane. Three days later, Benzema scored another double in a 3–0 first leg away win over Cypriot club APOEL in the Champions League quarter-finals. On 29 April, Benzema put in a masterpiece performance scoring two goals and assisting on another in a 3–0 win over Sevilla. The double was his seventh {{of the season and}} allowed Madrid to close in on its first Primera Division title in four years. Los Blancos captured their 32nd league title the following week cruising to a 3–0 win over Athletic Bilbao. Benzema appeared as a second-half substitute in the match.|$|E

40|$|The {{logic of}} {{equality}} with uninterpreted functions (EUF) {{provides a means}} of abstracting the manipulation of data by a processor when verifying the correctness of its control logic. By reducing formulas in this logic to propositional formulas, we can apply Boolean methods such as Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and Boolean satisfiability checkers to perform the verification. We can exploit characteristics of the formulas describing the verification conditions to greatly simplify the propositional formulas generated. In particular, we exploit the property that many equations appear only <b>in</b> <b>positive</b> <b>form.</b> We can therefore reduce the set of interpretations of the function symbols that must be considered to prove that a formula is universally valid to those that are ``maximally diverse. '' We present experimental results demonstrating the efficiency of this approach when verifying pipelined processors using the method proposed by Burch and Dill. Comment: 46 page...|$|E

50|$|It is {{considered}} informal to apply used to in questions or negative sentences, as Did he use(d) to...? or He didn't use(d) to...; {{but this is}} sometimes used in informal spoken English.

It indicates that something was often repeated in the past, but it does not usually occur in the present. Used to {{can also be used to}} talk about past realities or generalizations which are no longer real. Both simple past and used to can refer to past habits, past facts and past generalizations; however, used to is preferred when emphasizing these forms of past repetition <b>in</b> <b>positive</b> <b>forms.</b> On the other hand, when forming questions or negative sentences, simple past is better.|$|R

Special attention {{is given to the}} following types of positive emotional communication: tolerant emotional communication, emotional emphasis, emotional neglect, and emotional tabooing.

60|$|Names {{which are}} <b>positive</b> <b>in</b> <b>form</b> are often {{negative}} in reality, {{and others are}} really <b>positive</b> though their <b>form</b> is negative. The word inconvenient, for example, does not express the mere absence of convenience; it expresses a positive attribute—that of being the cause of discomfort or annoyance. So the word unpleasant, notwithstanding its negative form, does not connote the mere absence of pleasantness, but a less degree of what is signified by the word painful, which, it is hardly necessary to say, is positive. Idle, on the other hand, is a word which, though <b>positive</b> <b>in</b> <b>form,</b> expresses nothing but what would be signified either by the phrase not working, or by the phrase not disposed to work; and sober, either by not drunk or by not drunken.|$|R

40|$|M. A. (Psychology) This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the role of two cognitive constructs, locus of control and self-efficacy, {{in the treatment of}} alcohol abuse/dependence. Alcohol is the most used psychoactive drug in the world and is associated with a myriad of physical, psychological and social problems (Kaplan & Sadock, 1994). A review of the literature indicates the potential utility of a cognitive conceptualisation of these alcohol-related disorders, and that both locus of control and self-efficacy are constructs of utility in the treatment of abuse and dependence. It was hypothesized that the two constructs would not be present <b>in</b> their <b>positive</b> <b>form</b> (high self-efficacy and internal locus of control) in a sample of male inpatients prior to a alcohol/dependence treatment programme. Secondly, it was hypothesized that there would be an increase in self-efficacy and a shift in an internal locus of control direction across treatment, both constructs being measured before and after treatment. Finally, it was hypothesized that a sample of inpatients in their first ever treatment programme would be more external in their locus of control orientation than a sample of inpatients that have been in prior treatment programmes. A sample of inpatients (n= 22) at a suburban rehabilitation clinic were assessed both prior to and after the programme, the sample being further divided into a first-time treatment group (n= 14) and a repeat treatment group (n= 8). Locus of control and selfefficacy specific to drinking abstinence were assessed, and a measure of cognitive competency was also used. The results were than analysed statistically. The hypothesis that the constructs would be absent <b>in</b> their <b>positive</b> <b>form</b> was partially supported. The hypothesis that there would be <b>positive</b> changes <b>in</b> both constructs across treatment was supported. The hypothesis that the two groups would differ according to locus of control was not supported...|$|R
40|$|Nonindependent mate choice {{occurs when}} a female is in-fluenced in her choices of mate by the social environment.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{definite}} descriptions involving positive-form vague adjectives such as ‘tall’, ‘big’ or ‘heavy’.

40|$|Borrowing {{largely from}} the Nietzschean and Heideggerian heritage, the works of Gianni Vattimo have been {{instrumental}} in promoting a nihilistic approach to Christianity. Vattimo’s method entails the weakening of metaphysics (absolute foundations) by exposing the violence so often associated with it. As a consequence, truth and knowledge are maintained as open concepts within the dialectical process. This {{does not mean that}} “strong relativism” now prevails as a legitimate philosophical viewpoint. What it does mean, however, is that Truth has simply been transformed into some intelligible form of truth. Moreover, Vattimo emphasizes that in the post-metaphysical (postabsolutist) world both secularism and nihilism are imperative to expanding truth and knowledge. As a result, it is argued that both philosophical positions are actually complementary to the roots of Christianity. Furthermore, I suggest that nihilism – <b>in</b> its <b>positive</b> <b>form</b> – not only expands the Christian message of charity, but also transforms it into its endless human potential...|$|R
