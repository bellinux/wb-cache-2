Felicity has been sacked after she was accused of sexual harassment. Laura arrives to congratulate Jim, and he thanks her for encouraging him.

25|$|Assuming this {{description}} is correct, Shusterman’s pragmatism lies {{somewhere in the}} middle between the above-mentioned positions. Although his analytic background and acceptance of some of Rorty’s ideas (he even subsumes his and Rorty’s thought under a common category of “reconstructivist genealogical-poetic pragmatism”) seemingly make him a neo-analytic pragmatist, the stress <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> the importance of the notion of experience, which Rorty would like to substitute with the notion of language, chimes perfectly with the neo-classical stance.|$|E

25|$|The band filmed a {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{depicting}} a teenage boy with bleached hair who is harassed by others. Wanting to fit in, he starts by cutting his hair short. He then takes his shirt off, and starts to cover himself with a black tar-like substance. <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> a fly mask, as he continues to cover himself with the tar, with Durst watching him in the background with a disgusted look on his face. The boy then exits his room and comes down the stairs, now mutated {{into some sort of}} human fly. He enters the kitchen, where his family simply ignores him. He jumps onto the kitchen table, and begins to throw around the food on the table, while rubbing some into his face.|$|E
25|$|Action {{takes place}} at Fehrbellin and in Berlin, 1675. The Prince of Homburg, a young officer of the Great Elector (Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg), is {{exhausted}} after a long campaign. Walking in his sleep, <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> a laurel wreath. Several noblemen notice this, and the Great Elector plays a trick on the Prince, which leads him to declare his love for the Elector's niece, Natalie. He is able {{to take one of}} her gloves. After waking from his dream the Prince is puzzled by the glove in his hand. When at the next council of war the plans for the next battle are being discussed, and duties are being handed out, the Prince is thrown into confusion by the appearance of Princess Natalie, who reveals herself as the owner of the glove, and he is distracted {{to the extent that he}} fails to take on board his orders, which are not to engage the enemy without a direct order to do so. Contrary to his instructions he attacks the enemy at the Battle of Fehrbellin – and wins.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{returns to}} his high school life, and {{eventually}} asks Liz {{to go to the}} homecoming dance with him. On the night of the dance, Parker learns that Liz is Toomes' daughter. Deducing Parker's secret identity, Toomes threatens retaliation if he interferes with his plans. During the dance, Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from Avengers Tower to the team's new headquarters. He dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit and races to Toomes' lair. He is first ambushed by Schultz, but defeats him with the help of Ned. At the lair, Toomes destroys the building's support beams and leaves Parker to die. Parker escapes the rubble and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach near Coney Island. He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes' life after some unstable material explodes, and leaving him for the police along with the plane's cargo. After her father's arrest, Liz moves away, and Parker declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full-time. Stark returns Parker's suit, which <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> at his apartment just as his Aunt May walks in.|$|E

[...] Sharkey expressed her compliments about Leto's performance, [...] "Leto's performance, though, is the revelation. ... It's a hauntingly authentic performance; the tailored suit <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> to meet with his disapproving father {{is one of the}} film's most moving scenes." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety said, [...] "Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto give terrific performances in this riveting and surprisingly relatable true story." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the midst}} of these events, Chloe begins a {{recurring}} relationship with Chance's brother Ronan Malloy (Jeff Branson).

Jeff Branson was also hopeful for the pairing, commending them for bringing out a [...] "different side" [...] of Ronan, describing them as [...] "a chance for him to drop the frosty, crusty exterior <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> because Chloe really gets under his skin, but in a good way." ...|$|E

500|$|Jeremy Fisher is a frog {{who lives}} in a damp little house amongst the {{buttercups}} {{at the edge of a}} pond. His larder and back passage are [...] "slippy-sloppy" [...] with water, but he likes getting his feet wet; no one ever scolds and he never catches cold. One day, Jeremy finds it raining and decides to go fishing. Should he catch more than five minnows, he will invite his friends to dinner. <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> a Macintosh and shiny Galoshes, takes his rod and basket, and sets off with [...] "enormous hops" [...] to the place where he keeps his lily-pad boat. He poles to a place he knows is good for minnows.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton's initial {{reply was}} accommodating: [...] "I {{would like to}} fall in with your views as far as {{possible}} without creating a position that would be untenable to myself". However, Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. [...] "I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided [...] "what limits <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> his own rights". To this Shackleton replied: [...] "There {{is no doubt in my}} mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further".|$|E

He then gets dressed, and begins his day as the camera moves about the surrounding rooms, which contain an assortment of objects from the 1960s to the present. <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> some music, begins an exercise routine, has a shower, makes himself some breakfast, and injects himself with a vaccine. He is interrupted by an explosion, spurring the man to arm himself before using a telescope-and-mirror system.

500|$|Pauline Kael of The New Yorker said [...] "The James Bond {{series has}} had its bummers, but nothing before {{in the class of}} A View to a Kill. You go to a Bond picture expecting some style or, at least, some flash, some lift; you don't expect the dumb police-car crashes you get here. You do see some ingenious daredevil feats, but they're crowded {{together}} and, the way they're set up, they don't give you the irresponsible, giddy tingle you're hoping for." [...] Kael also singled out the dispirited direction and the hopeless script. [...] "Director John Glen stages the slaughter scenes so apathetically that the picture itself seems dissociated. (I don't think I've ever seen another movie in which race horses were mistreated and the director failed to work up any indignation. If Glen has any emotions about what <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> the screen, he keeps them to himself.)" ...|$|E
500|$|Music {{has played}} a crucial part in Lat's life since his youth; he {{revealed}} {{in an interview that}} listening to songs such as Peggy March's [...] "I Will Follow Him" [...] and Paul & Paula's [...] "Hey Paula" [...] helped him learn English. [...] Listening to music had also become an important ritual in his work, providing him with inspiration in his art. [...] When he sketches [...] "fashionable girls", <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> Paul McCartney's tracks, and switches to Indonesian gamelan when he needs to draw intricate details. [...] He enjoys pop music, particularly rock music of the 1950s and 60s, listening to The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Elvis Presley. [...] Lat is also partial to country music, and to singers such as Hank Williams and Roy Rogers because he finds their tunes [...] "humble". [...] His enjoyment of music is more than a passive interest; he is proficient with the guitar and piano, and can play them by ear.|$|E
500|$|The episode jumps forward {{twelve years}} to when Clark (Tom Welling) {{is trying to}} find his identity. He is unable to handle being told of his alien origins and runs away from home. Although he is {{attracted}} to Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk), he cannot get close to her without falling over in pain because she wears a necklace made of meteor rock (kryptonite), which is a radioactive fragment of Clark's destroyed homeworld. This was a concept Gough and Millar devised to establish a reason for Clark's clumsiness. In other media, it is usually portrayed as an act <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> to deceive people of his true identity. But Clark and Lana do share an intimate moment at a cemetery, where Lana is visiting the grave of her parents. In such scenes, Gough and Millar created a theme of loneliness through the life stories of Clark and Lana. Lana's boyfriend, Whitney Fordman (Eric Johnson), becomes jealous of Clark and Lana's friendship and ties Clark to a scarecrow pole, using Lana's necklace, indirectly, to subdue Clark. This image of Clark, in just his underwear and a red [...] "S" [...] painted on his chest, stretches back to Gough and Millar's foundation for the series, which was about taking Clark down to the basic elements of the Superman character.|$|E

2500|$|Hall {{mentioned}} that achieving a unique {{look for the}} mechanical armor took some time and [...] "just trying to get something that felt like {{the personality of the}} character." [...] Co-director Williams stated, [...] "A big part of the design challenge is when <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> the armor you want to feel that he's a very powerful intimidating presence…at the same time, design-wise he has to relate to the really adorable simple vinyl robot underneath." [...] Baymax's face design was inspired by a copper suzu bell that Hall noticed while at a Shinto shrine.|$|E
