500|$|Simple {{movements}} {{were developed by}} their choreographers, including Leeanne Ashley, to accompany each song because, as The New York Times reported, they believed [...] "in the power of basic movements to enchant young children". [...] According to reporter Anders Wright, they intentionally made mistakes in their dance moves {{in order to identify}} more with their young audience. [...] The group incorporated more dancing into their performances after the birth of Field's oldest daughter in 2004. [...] "So [...] Wiggles <b>have</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> become a bit more, dare I say, girly. Dorothy (the Dinosaur) does ballet now and we dance as well a lot more than we did", Field reported. [...] In later years, corresponding with Field's developing interests in acrobatics and gymnastics, they added these elements to their stage shows, including, as Field reported, hiring several world-class athletes such as former trampoline champion Karl Shore. [...] Watkins, whom Paul Field called [...] "a dancer of many disciplines", was initially hired as a member of their troupe and referred to herself as [...] "mainly a dancer".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} the album was thematically {{different}} from Fallen, Lee said that [...] "all of the negative and hard, difficult experiences" [...] that characterized the band's music still came across, but displays a less hopeless attitude. Rather than wallowing in [...] "the hard stuff", the record's theme reflects on looking for solutions and happiness. In an interview with MTV News, Lee said about the album's title: I feel like I {{have the ability to}} do a lot of things I couldn't do before, for a number of reasons......A lot of doors <b>have</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> been opened in my life—not just since everything has happened for us. The singer also felt the band [...] "broke the doors" [...] and tried doing different things, which was also an inspiration for the title. Simon Cosyns of The Sun labelled the record's artwork—which sees Lee in front of an open door—as [...] " [...] the dark Evanescence image intact, with sinister fairytale scenes, elaborate Victorian gothic arches, illuminated typography and elaborate flowing dresses". Dane Prokofiev of PopMatters praised the album cover, calling it [...] " [...] gother-looking piece." ...|$|E

500|$|For the 30th {{anniversary of}} The Joshua Tree, U2 staged a 2017 concert tour in North America, Europe, and Latin America, {{on which the}} album was played in its {{entirety}} at each show. It {{was the first time}} the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue, rather than a new release. As part of the tour, U2 headlined the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In rationalising the tour, the Edge cited the 2016 US presidential election and other world events for what he judged to be renewed resonance of The Joshua Trees subject matter. He said that in looking at the record's anniversary, [...] "things <b>have</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> come full circle, if you want. That record was written in the mid-Eighties, during the Reagan–Thatcher era of British and U.S. politics. It was a period when there was a lot of unrest. Thatcher was in the throes of trying to put down the miners' strike; there was all kinds of shenanigans going on in Central America. It feels like we're right back there in a way. I don't think any of our work has ever come full circle to that extent. It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn't have three years ago, four years ago.'" ...|$|E

He indicated that the band had spent three weeks working in a recording studio with Gil Norton, the producer behind Recovering the Satellites, and revealed the working title of the album to be Saturday Nights & Sunday Mornings. Duritz explained that [...] "Saturday night is when you sin and Sunday is when you regret. Sinning is often done very loudly, angrily, bitterly, violently." [...] Vickrey stated that [...] "the idea {{at the moment is}} to <b>have</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a rocking side and then an acoustic-y, maybe country-ish side. We got the first half done in May in New York, so half of it is pretty strong and done. And now we're going to work on the second half, the country tunes, during the tour." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{approaching}} the fanfare, Tyler looked {{not just at}} the films, but [...] "Marvel as a whole...going {{all the way back}} from The Human Torch through" [...] the comics. Because [...] "there was very little time for the listener or the viewer to really hone in on what's there musically", Tyler [...] "needed something that could be played a little bit more simply as a melody. Then all the orchestration—you know, I wrote these string lines that are actually, <b>have</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a fantastical, more complex nature to it. That just supports a melody that is more of a whistler." [...] Marvel agreed with this approach, and worked with Tyler to hone the orchestration; [...] "as the graphics were being done we really wanted to hit little moments with some sparkly shimmer and get it more specific." [...] The main melody remained unchanged from Tyler's initial composition.|$|E
