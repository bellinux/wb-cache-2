He advocated Hubbard's [...] "research" [...] as the only way to deal with these problems, claiming, [...] "Doctors {{do not know how to}} diagnose chemical exposures [...] You go to a doctor and now he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> on more and more drugs, steroids and things that are ineffective." ...|$|E

[...] He stopped suddenly to say, [...] "Another white man’s trick, let me go." [...] But he was held by guards and police, and {{when he tried to}} free himself from their grasp, a soldier stepped from behind and ran a bayonet through his kidney. He died during the night while his father sand the death song over his prostrate body. His father and mother and neighbors carried the body to a secret cave, saying it must not be polluted by the touch of any white man." ...|$|E
2500|$|The fictional character's name {{may have}} been derived from a jolly and {{flamboyant}} fireman named Tom Sawyer with whom Twain was acquainted in San Francisco, California, while Twain was employed as a reporter at the San Francisco Call. Twain used to listen to Sawyer tell stories of his youth, [...] "Sam, he would listen to these pranks of mine with great interest and he'd occasionally take 'em down in his notebook. One day he says to me: ‘I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> between the covers of a book some of these days, Tom.’ ‘Go ahead, Sam,’ I said, ‘but don’t disgrace my name.’" [...] Twain himself said the character sprang from three people, later identified as: John B. Briggs (who died in 1907), William Bowen (who died in 1893) and Twain; however Twain later changed his story saying Sawyer was fully formed solely from his imagination, but as Robert Graysmith says, [...] "The great appropriator liked to pretend his characters sprang fully grown from his fertile mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Out Magazine, Amos used the song [...] "Maybe California", a track from the album in which a mother ruminates on leaving her husband and child(ren) [...] "better off" [...] as she contemplates suicide, to explain just how personal writing and composing both the song and the record as a whole were for her: [...] "I wouldn’t have written this record if I hadn’t been pushed — {{for all kinds of}} reasons. I don’t want to go into all of it but “Maybe California” doesn’t come from nowhere. You’re not able to write that by having a drink with somebody who’s had the experience and you haven’t. You have to be pushed to that place." [...] She speaks of the mother figure in the song: [...] "there's nothing that she can give to stop this terrible emotional cancer that has taken over her family - her life - everything around her." [...] Adding credence to the notion that the song is deeply autobiographical, Amos chose to highlight the despair older, more mature women, such as herself, face: [...] "I began to realize how serious this quiet, tragic problem was and that it's not okay to talk about it, whereas teen suicide - it gets discussed and it's almost something where there are [...] for it. But mothers contemplating this - my God - they're just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> in a nuthouse." ...|$|E

At a pre-production meeting for Gone with the Wind, [...] "Assistant director Eric Stacey made the suggestion: why not assemble all the sets in a replica of 1864 Atlanta and send the whole thing up in flames?"

60|$|FROME. [Rising and {{bowing to}} the JUDGE] If it please your lordship {{and gentlemen of}} the jury. I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> dispute the fact that the {{prisoner}} altered this cheque, but I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> before <b>you</b> evidence as to the condition of his mind, and to submit that you would not be justified in finding that he was responsible for his actions at the time. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> show you, in fact, that he did this in a moment of aberration, amounting to temporary insanity, caused by the violent distress under which he was labouring. Gentlemen, the prisoner is only twenty-three years old. I shall call before you a woman from whom you will learn the events that led up to this act. You will hear from her own lips the tragic circumstances of her life, the still more tragic infatuation with which she has inspired the prisoner. This woman, gentlemen, has been leading a miserable existence with a husband who habitually ill-uses her, from whom she actually goes in terror of her life. I am not, of course, saying that it's either right or desirable for a young man {{to fall in love with}} a married woman, or that it's his business to rescue her from an ogre-like husband. I'm not saying anything of the sort. But we all know the power of the passion of love; and I would ask you to remember, gentlemen, in listening to her evidence, that, married to a drunken and violent husband, she has no power to get rid of him; for, as you know, another offence besides violence is necessary to enable a woman to obtain a divorce; and of this offence it does not appear that her husband is guilty.|$|R
5000|$|The {{recording}} by Tony Bennett {{was released}} by Columbia Records as catalog number 40965. It first reached the Billboard magazine charts on August 12, 1957 and lasted 14 weeks on the chart. On the Disk Jockey chart, it peaked at #13; on the Best Seller chart, at #9; on the composite chart of the top 100 songs, it reached #9, becoming the last Top 10 hit of Bennett's career. With this song, Bennett had his all-time worst disagreement with Mitch Miller, [...] Columbia's pop music executive at the time, who absolutely wanted Bennett to record {{a version of the}} song; similarly, Bennett [...] "wanted not to go anywhere" [...] near it. Bennett had no response to Miller's question, [...] "Am I <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>you</b> <b>put</b> out a bad record?" [...] Having not entirely gotten over his fear of losing his contract with Columbia, Bennett subsequently sang a half-hearted version of the song (which was never recorded). After the performance, Miller got disgusted and told Bennett to [...] "just give him one take all the way through and we can all go home." ...|$|R
