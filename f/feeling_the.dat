5|$|A {{girl who}} Peter Parker has loved since childhood. Mary Jane has an abusive father, and aspires {{to become an}} actress, but becomes a {{waitress}} at a run down diner, a fact she hides from her boyfriend, Harry. Before Raimi cast Dunst, he had expressed his interest in casting Alicia Witt. Dunst decided to audition after learning Maguire had been cast, <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> film would have a more independent feel. Dunst earned the role a month before shooting in an audition in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Como's Hollywood-type {{good looks}} {{earned him a}} seven-year {{contract}} with 20th Century-Fox in 1943. He made four films for Fox, Something for the Boys (1944), March of Time (1945), Doll Face (1945), and If I'm Lucky (1946), plus Words and Music for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (1948).

50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of finer feeling: <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of <b>the</b> sublime and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of <b>the</b> beautiful. Kant gives {{examples}} of these pleasant feelings. Some of his examples of <b>feelings</b> of <b>the</b> beautiful are the sight of flower beds, grazing flocks, and daylight. <b>Feelings</b> of <b>the</b> sublime are the result of seeing mountain peaks, raging storms, and night.|$|R
50|$|Kant {{subdivided}} {{the sublime}} into three kinds. <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> of <b>the</b> terrifying sublime is sometimes accompanied {{with a certain}} dread or melancholy. <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> of <b>the</b> noble sublime is quiet wonder. <b>Feelings</b> of <b>the</b> splendid sublime are pervaded with beauty.|$|R
5|$|For the 1996 championship, Canavan {{was handed}} the {{captaincy}} of Tyrone, and was Ulster's leading scorer {{for the third}} year in a row, and subsequently awarded his third successive All Star. Tyrone reached the All-Ireland semi-final against Meath, but Canavan was one of six Tyrone players to sustain injuries that day, which some Tyrone fans attribute to Meath's heavy-handedness. Canavan's injury was so severe that he was still <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> effects for over a year, and there was speculation as to whether he had been playing on a broken foot.|$|E
5|$|In November 1874, several {{shipowners}} were contracted for {{two years}} from the South Australian government to provide ten round trips between the colonial capital of Adelaide and its furthest outpost, Port Darwin. Port Darwin was <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> effects of a gold rush at Pine Creek and growing quickly as a trade post with the Dutch East Indies. However, all the local banks sent their money, together with government paperwork and the Royal Mail, around the east coast to Adelaide. On successful completion of each voyage, the South Australian government would pay the owners £1000 sterling.|$|E

50|$|The {{evaluator}} is {{instructed to}} assess {{the extent to which}} the patient displays the given criterion. Each item is scored independently based on a five-point, ratio scale. A rating of 0 indicates that <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> is not present in the patient. A rating of 1 indicates mild prevalence of <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> in <b>the</b> patient. A rating of 2 indicates moderate prevalence of <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> in <b>the</b> patient. A rating of 3 indicates severe prevalence of <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> in <b>the</b> patient.

As the Kennedy administration brought more emphasis on conventional warfare, Shoup sought to use increased funds to improve military logistics. He is credited with formulating an entirely new system of financial management, supply, and inventory management. He also created a new Data Processing Division to centralize the data processing functions of several combat service support branches.|$|E
5|$|The {{net result}} was that little work was done on the Waterloo Medal. In 1832, the Master of the Mint, Lord Auckland, noted that the dies had been long delayed. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, also complained about the delay, <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> medal could be {{finished}} in 18 months. He offered Pistrucci extra payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci declined.|$|E

During the remembering of the word there may be two things—the word and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of peace or tranquility.

5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E
5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
5|$|Brazil defender and captain Thiago Silva was {{suspended}} for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards, despite an appeal against the suspension by the Brazilian Football Confederation. Forward Neymar was also unavailable for the match, having been sidelined {{for the rest of}} the tournament after suffering a fractured vertebra in the quarter-final match against Colombia. Dante and Bernard, making their first starts of the tournament, replaced Thiago Silva and Neymar respectively with Luiz Gustavo replacing Paulinho in defensive midfield. Germany were unchanged from their quarter-final. Goalkeeper Júlio César and stand-in captain David Luiz paid tribute to Neymar by holding his shirt during the national anthem ceremony. Even with the absences, analysts expected a close match, <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> home crowd could provide an advantage.|$|E

5|$|By April, {{resistance}} against the Third Army was tapering off, and the forces' main efforts turned to managing some 400,000 German prisoners of war. On April 14, 1945 Patton {{was promoted to}} general, a promotion long advocated by Stimson in recognition of Patton's battle accomplishments during 1944. Later that month, Patton, Bradley and Eisenhower toured the Merkers salt mine {{as well as the}} Ohrdruf concentration camp, and seeing the conditions of the camp firsthand caused Patton great disgust. Third Army was ordered toward Bavaria and Czechoslovakia, anticipating a last stand by Nazi German forces there. He was reportedly appalled to learn the Red Army would take Berlin, <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union was a threat to the U.S. army's advance to Pilsen, but was stopped by Eisenhower from reaching Prague before V-E Day on May 8 {{and the end of the}} war in Europe.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1973, John Lennon began {{distancing}} himself from {{the political and social}} issues he had embraced in the previous 18 months. It was also around this time that he and his wife, Yoko Ono, were going through marital problems. As Ono was completing her fourth album, <b>Feeling</b> <b>the</b> Space, Lennon decided he also wanted to record a new album, and liked the studio musicians that their assistant and production coordinator May Pang had assembled for Ono's album. Shortly thereafter, he asked Pang to book them for his sessions. Wanting to produce an album that would be more accepted than his previous politically charged commercial flop Some Time in New York City, Lennon began writing and demoing a few songs for Mind Games in his Greenwich Village apartment. He began composing after a period of almost a year of not writing any material.|$|E
5|$|Cynthia {{knew her}} husband took drugs like Preludin, and {{regularly}} smoked cannabis but {{thought of them}} as not being very dangerous. On 27 March 1965, {{at a dinner party}} given by a dentist, John Riley, the Lennons, Harrison, and Boyd were given LSD without their knowledge. Although told not to leave the house, Harrison drove them to various nightclubs, with Riley following them by taxi. At the Ad Lib club, they thought the lift up to the club was on fire and started screaming, before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, and Starr were waiting. Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd's Mini Cooper at no more than 10mph, as he was also <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> effects of the drug. They stayed up all night at Kenwood, experiencing the full effects of their first LSD trip.|$|E

5|$|<b>Feeling</b> <b>the</b> need to {{seek out}} truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try to}} help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E
5|$|Hergé had {{developed}} {{the idea of}} setting an Adventure of Tintin on the moon while producing Prisoners of the Sun. He began serialisation of Destination Moon, {{the first of a}} two part arc followed by Explorers on the Moon, in Tintin magazine in March 1950. In September 1950, Hergé broke off the story, <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> need for a break from work, having fallen back into clinical depression. He and Germaine went on holiday to Gland before returning to Brussels in late September. Many readers sent letters to Tintin asking why Explorers on the Moon was no longer being serialised, with a rumour emerging that Hergé had died. Explorers of the Moon would resume after an eighteen month hiatus, returning in April 1952.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Burnet {{decided that}} {{research}} at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the Australian National University's John Curtin School of Medical Research. After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to autoimmune diseases and the graft-versus-host reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.|$|E
50|$|Kant {{described}} {{the relationship between}} these finer <b>feelings</b> and humanity. <b>The</b> <b>feelings</b> are not totally separate from each other. Beauty and the sublime can be joined or alternated. Kant claimed that tragedy, for the most part, stirs <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of <b>the</b> sublime. Comedy arouses <b>feelings</b> for beauty. <b>The</b> personal appearance of humans prompts these feelings in various cases. A person's social position also affects these feelings.|$|R
