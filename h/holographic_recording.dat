2500|$|The {{galaxy is}} in the midst of a civil war. Spies for the Rebel Alliance have stolen plans to the Galactic Empire's Death Star, a heavily armed space station capable of {{destroying}} an entire planet. Rebel leader Princess Leia has the plans, but her ship is captured by Imperial forces under the command of the evil Darth Vader. Before she is captured, Leia hides the plans in the memory of an astromech droid, R2-D2, along with a <b>holographic</b> <b>recording.</b> [...] R2-D2 flees to the surface of the desert planet Tatooine with C-3PO, a protocol droid.|$|E

50|$|The soldier {{emerges from}} a duct in the floor of another corridor, and enters a {{security}} room containing a holographic projector. The soldier removes her helmet, revealing herself to be a young woman. By viewing the <b>holographic</b> <b>records,</b> she discovers footage of a human test subject being administered an injection, which triggers a metamorphosis into the creature she had been pursuing.

40|$|<b>Holographic</b> <b>records</b> are {{relatively}} new technology. Their application is very wide. They apply in engineering, geology, medicine, communication technologies and in security services. This document discuss about {{short history of}} holography, basic principles and properities of used waves. Single types of hologprahy are divided by frequency (wavelength) of used wave. This work addicts to requirements of material properities that are applicable for recording and describes some of materials used for recording.

50|$|A simple {{hologram}} {{can be made}} by superimposing two plane {{waves from}} the same light source on a <b>holographic</b> <b>recording</b> medium. The two waves interfere giving a straight line fringe pattern whose intensity varies sinusoidally across the medium. The spacing of the fringe pattern is determined by the angle between the two waves, and on the wavelength of the light.|$|E
50|$|A thin {{hologram}} is {{one where}} {{the thickness of the}} recording medium is much less than the spacing of the interference fringes which make up the <b>holographic</b> <b>recording.</b> The thickness of a thin hologram can be down to 60 nm by using a topological insulator material Sb2Te3 thin film. Ultrathin holograms hold the potential to be integrated with everyday consuming electronics like smartphone.|$|E
50|$|When a plane wave-front {{illuminates}} {{a negative}} lens, it is expanded into a wave {{which appears to}} diverge from {{the focal point of}} the lens. Thus, when the recorded pattern is illuminated with the original plane wave, some of the light is diffracted into a diverging beam equivalent to the original spherical wave; a <b>holographic</b> <b>recording</b> of the point source has been created.|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} resolution in digital holography {{is limited by the}} size of the captured <b>holographic</b> <b>record.</b> Here, we present a method to circumvent this limit by self-extrapolating experimental holograms beyond the area that is actually captured. This is done by first padding the surroundings of the hologram and then conducting an iterative reconstruction procedure. The wavefront beyond the experimentally detected area is thus retrieved and the hologram reconstruction shows enhanced resolution. To demonstrate the power of this concept, we apply it to simulated as well as experimental holograms. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures, MATLAB cod...|$|R

5000|$|In October 1992, {{they began}} working with James Sfarnas and his label <b>Holographic</b> <b>Records.</b> Under <b>Holographic</b> they re-released their self {{recorded}} 1st album Moth. That release was well received with indie press and college radio throughout the U.S. Following that release, Holographic took the band back in the studio to record [...] "Deeper Green" [...] and [...] "Skinny Flesh" [...] with producer Bill Halverson and was released nationally as a 45 single in 1993. The single received rave reviews and lots of airplay on college radio and enabled the band to tour for the first time.|$|R
50|$|The {{recorded}} {{light pattern}} is a diffraction grating. When it is illuminated {{by only one}} of the waves used to create it, it can be shown that one of the diffracted waves emerges at the same angle as that at which the second wave was originally incident so that the second wave has been 'reconstructed'. Thus, the recorded light pattern is a <b>holographic</b> <b>recording</b> as defined above.|$|E
5000|$|For a given {{numerical}} aperture (NA), {{the resolution of}} microscopy for flat objects under coherent illumination can be improved using interferometric microscopy. Using the partial images from a <b>holographic</b> <b>recording</b> {{of the distribution of}} the complex optical field, the large aperture image can be reconstructed numerically. [...] Another technique, 4 Pi microscopy uses two opposing objectives to double the effective {{numerical aperture}}, effectively halving the diffraction limit.|$|E
50|$|Now alone {{inside the}} cathedral, Aveline {{stepped up to}} the altar where the Prophecy Disk had been placed.

50|$|These {{requirements}} are inter-related, {{and it is}} essential {{to understand the nature of}} optical interference to see this. Interference is the variation in intensity which can occur when two light waves are superimposed. The intensity of the maxima exceeds the sum of the individual intensities of the two beams, and the intensity at the minima is less than this and may be zero. The interference pattern maps the relative phase between the two waves, and any change in the relative phases causes the interference pattern to move across the field of view. If the relative phase of the two waves changes by one cycle, then the pattern drifts by one whole fringe. One phase cycle corresponds to a change in the relative distances travelled by the two beams of one wavelength. Since the wavelength of light is of the order of 0.5 μm, it can be seen that very small changes in the optical paths travelled by either of the beams in the <b>holographic</b> <b>recording</b> system lead to movement of the interference pattern which is the <b>holographic</b> <b>recording.</b> Such changes can be caused by relative movements of any of the optical components or the object itself, and also by local changes in air-temperature. It is essential that any such changes are significantly less than the wavelength of light if a clear well-defined recording of the interference is to be created.|$|E
