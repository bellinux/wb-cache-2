40|$|The {{spraying}} of an impinging jet is {{an effective}} way to cool heated surfaces. A numerical model has been previously developed to predict the heat transfer with phase change between a hot plate surface and a two-phase impinging jet. This Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is applied here for studying the spray cooling of conventional and <b>impregnated</b> <b>coil</b> windings of electric motors. The numerical results are compared with measurements obtained on an experimental test bench. The confrontation numerical/experimental is carried out by comparing the distribution of temperature inside the coil windings. This study has confirmed the interest of the cooling spray technique.

40|$|To {{explore the}} limits of layer wound (RE) Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x (REBCO, RE = Rare Earth) coils in a high {{magnetic}} field environment > 30 T, {{a series of small}} insert coils have been built and characterized in background fields. One of the coils repeatedly reached 35. 4 T using a single ~ 100 m length of REBCO tape wet wound with epoxy and nested in a 31 T background magnet. The coil was quenched safely several times without degradation. Contributing to the success of this coil was the introduction of a thin polyester film that surrounded the conductor.

40|$|Self-absorbing quench {{protection}} {{schemes for}} accelerator magnets mainly rely on longitudinal and turn-to-turn normal zone propagation (NZP) {{immediately after the}} occurrence of a quench and subsequently {{on the effectiveness of}} protection heaters. Especially for impregnated Nb/sub 3 /Sn coils the protection should not only aim at limitation of the hot spot temperature and internal voltages but also at avoidance of large temperature gradients and local stress accumulation. Considering Rutherford types of cable based on present high current density Nb/sub 3 /Sn wires with a relatively low stabilizer content, a priori knowledge about their NZP properties is mandatory. Especially the medium and low-field properties appear to be critical for coil protection.

It features a horizontal dipole nested inside a vertical dipole The coils of the 0. 6 m long single-bore magnet are wound with 7 or 9 rectangular superconducting wires pre-assembled as flat cables.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} Formula 456, an aliphatic amine cured epoxy for <b>impregnating</b> <b>coils</b> and high voltage transformers. Sandia has evaluated a number of MDA-free epoxy encapsulants which relied on either anhydride or other aromatic amine curing agents. The use of aliphatic amine curing agents was more recently evaluated and {{has resulted in the}} definition of Formula 456 resin. Methylene dianiline (MDA) has been used for more than 20 years as the curing agent for various epoxy formulations throughout the Department of Energy and much of industry. Sandia National Laboratories began the process of replacing MDA with other formulations because of regulations imposed by OSHA on the use of MDA. OSHA has regulated MDA because it is a suspect carcinogen. Typically the elimination of OSHA-regulated materials provides a rare opportunity to qualify new formulations in a range of demanding applications. It was important {{to take full advantage of}} that opportunity, although the associated materials qualification effort was costly. Small high voltage transformers are one of those demanding applications. The successful implementation of the new formulation for high reliability transformers will be described. The test results that demonstrate the parts are qualified for use in DOE weapon systems will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of high-current superconductors is challenging {{in the design}} of superconducting magnets. When the stability requirements are fulfilled, the protection against a quench must still be considered. A main factor {{in the design of}} quench protection systems is the resistance growth rate in the magnet following a quench. The usual method for determining the resistance growth in <b>impregnated</b> <b>coils</b> is to calculate the longitudinal velocity with which the normal zone propagates in the conductor along the coil windings. Here, we present a 2 D numerical model for predicting the normal zone propagation velocity in Al stabilized Rutherford NbTi cables with large cross section. By solving two coupled differential equations under adiabatic conditions, the model takes into account the thermal diffusion and the current redistribution process following a quench. Both the temperature and magnetic field dependencies of the superconductor and the metal cladding materials properties are included. Unlike common normal zone propagation analyses, we study the influence of the thickness of the cladding on the propagation velocity for varying operating current and magnetic field. To assist in the comprehension of the numerical results, we also introduce an analytical formula for the longitudinal normal zone propagation. The analysis distinguishes between low-current and high-current regimes of normal zone propagation, depending on the ratio between the characteristic times of thermal and magnetic diffusion. We show that above a certain thickness, the cladding acts as a heat sink with a limited contribution to the acceleration of the propagation velocity with respect to the cladding geometry. Both numerical and analytical results show good agreement with experimental data. Comment: To be published in Physics Procedia (ICEC 25 conference special issue...|$|R

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{cooling system}} for the muon collider will consist of a 200 meter long line of alternating field straight solenoids interspersed with bent solenoids. The muons are cooled in all directions using a 400 mm long section liquid hydrogen at high field. The muons are accelerated in the forward direction by about 900 mm long, 805 MHz RF cavities in a gradient field that goes from 6 T to - 6 T in about 300 mm. The high field section in the channel starts out at an induction of about 2 T in the hydrogen. As the muons proceed down the cooling channel, the induction in the liquid hydrogen section increases to inductions as high as 30 T. The diameter of the liquid hydrogen section starts at 750 mm when the induction is 2 T. As the induction in the cooling section goes up, {{the diameter of the}} liquid hydrogen section decreases. When the high field induction is 30 T, the diameter of the liquid hydrogen section is about 80 mm.
