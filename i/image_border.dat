40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a three-dimensional foot scanner which can form images or three-dimensional data records of feet of human bodies {{and is used}} for the manufacturing shoe trees. The three-dimensional foot scanner comprises a foot scanning device and a foot image analysis system, wherein the foot scanning device is used for shooting a medial <b>border</b> <b>image,</b> a lateral <b>border</b> <b>image</b> and a sole image of a foot; and the foot image analysis system is used for analyzing the medial <b>border</b> <b>image,</b> the lateral <b>border</b> <b>image</b> and the sole image of the foot so as to acquire three-dimensional foot data. In the three-dimensional foot scanner, the medial <b>border</b> <b>image,</b> the lateral <b>border</b> <b>image</b> and the sole image of the foot are shot by a plurality of cameras, the images are corrected and spliced, integrated outlines of the medial border, the lateral border and the sole of the foot are extracted, and standard three-dimensional foot data is combined so as to generate a foot three-dimensional model. By using the three-dimensional foot scanner, the scanning time and production cost are greatly reduced on the premise of ensuring certain precision. 本发明涉及一种三维足部扫描仪，该三维足部扫描仪能形成人体足部的图像或三维数据记录，用于鞋楦的制作。该三维足部扫描仪包括：足部扫描装置，用于拍摄足部内侧图像、足部外侧图像和足部底部图像；以及足部图像分析系统，用于对所述足部内侧图像、足部外侧图像和足部底部图像进行分析以获取三维足部数据。本发明首先利用多个摄像头拍摄足部内侧、外侧和底部的图像，再对图像进行校正和拼接，并提取完整的足部内侧、外侧和底部轮廓，结合标准三维足部数据生成足部三维模型。本发明在保证一定精度的前提下，减少扫描所需时间，并且大大降低生产成本。Institute of Textiles and ClothingInventor name used in this publication: 张一帆Inventor name used in this publication: 马啸Title in Traditional Chinese: 三維足部掃描儀Chin...|$|R

40|$|Effective image {{compression}} requires a non-expansive discrete wavelet transform (DWT) be employed; consequently, <b>image</b> <b>border</b> extension {{is a critical}} issue. Ideally, the <b>image</b> <b>border</b> extension method should not introduce distortion under compression. It {{has been shown in}} literature that symmetric extension performs better than periodic extension. However, the non-expansive, symmetric extension using fast Fourier transform and circular convolution DWT methods require symmetric filters. This precludes orthogonal wavelets for image com-pression since they cannot simultaneously possess the desirable properties of orthogonality and symmetry. Thus, biorthogonal wavelets have been the de facto standard for image com-pression applications. The viability of symmetric extension with biorthogonal wavelets is the primary reason cited for their superior performance. Recent matrix-based techniques for computing a non-expansive DWT have suggested the possibility of implementing symmetric extension with orthogonal wavelets. For the first time, this thesis analyzes and compares orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelets with symmetric extension. Our results indicate a significant performance improvement for orthogonal wavelets whe...|$|E

30|$|Salient object {{detection}} {{remains one}} of the most important and active research topics in computer vision, with wide-ranging applications to object recognition, scene understanding, image retrieval, context aware image editing, image compression, etc. Most existing methods directly determine salient objects by exploring various salient object features. Here, we propose a novel graph based ranking method to detect and segment the most salient object in a scene according to its relationship to <b>image</b> <b>border</b> (background) regions, i.e., the background feature. Firstly, we use regions/super-pixels as graph nodes, which are fully connected to enable both long range and short range relations to be modeled. The relationship of each region to the <b>image</b> <b>border</b> (background) is evaluated in two stages: (i) ranking with hard background queries, and (ii) ranking with soft foreground queries. We experimentally show how this two-stage ranking based salient object detection method is complementary to traditional methods, and that integrated results outperform both. Our method allows the exploitation of intrinsic image structure to achieve high quality salient object determination using a quadratic optimization framework, with a closed form solution which can be easily computed. Extensive method evaluation and comparison using three challenging saliency datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms 10 state-of-theart models by a big margin.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Gabor {{filters are}} widely applied in image {{analysis}} and computer vision applications. This paper describes a fast algorithm for isotropic complex Gabor filtering that outperforms existing implementations. The main computational improvement {{arises from the}} decomposition of Gabor filtering into more efficient Gaussian filtering and sinusoidal modulations. Appropriate filter initial conditions are derived to avoid boundary transients, without requiring explicit <b>image</b> <b>border</b> extension. Our proposal reduces up to 39 % the number of required operations with respect to state-of-the-art approaches. A full C++ implementation of the method is publicly available. I...|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} of the proposed architecture including implementation of flat reconfigurable SEs with any shape that fits within the maximum hardware realised SE boundaries. The SE flexibility {{can be used to}} avoid processing data outside the <b>image</b> <b>borders,</b> which can introduce inaccuracies and corrupt the output response. The SE can be explicitly controlled using a soft microprocessor to ignore pixels outside the image dimension boundaries or form any SE shape through generating false signals at specific SE points with the previously described pixel sample processing system.|$|R

40|$|Domain Specific Languages for image {{processing}} offer simplified programming and efficient execution {{on a variety}} of platforms. These languages are particularly suitable for implementing local {{image processing}} operators that produce each output pixel by processing a corresponding window of input pixels. Such operators are easily parallelised and vectorised for efficiency. However, border handling is required to define the results for pixels close to the <b>image</b> <b>border</b> where the input window partially falls outside the bounds of the input image. We propose a declarative approach to border handling in a functional image processing Domain Specific Language called Halide. The compiler uses code analysis to infer the bounds of output images and to optimise border padding implementations.
