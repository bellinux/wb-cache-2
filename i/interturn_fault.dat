40|$|Abstract—A robust <b>interturn</b> <b>fault</b> {{diagnostic}} approach {{based on}} the concept of magnetic field pendulous oscillation, which occurs in induction motors under faulty conditions, is introduced in this paper. This approach enables one to distinguish and classify an unbalanced voltage power supply and machine manufacturing/construction imperfections from an <b>interturn</b> <b>fault.</b> The experimental results for the two case studies of a set of 5 -hp and 2 -hp induction motors verify the validity of the proposed approach. Moreover, it can be concluded from the experimental results that if the circulating current level in the shorted loop increases beyond the phase current level, an <b>interturn</b> <b>fault</b> can be easily detected using the proposed approach even {{in the presence of the}} existence of motor manufacturing imperfection effects.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method of <b>interturn</b> <b>fault</b> {{detection}} based on measurement of pulsewidth modulation (PWM) ripple current. The method uses the ripple current {{generated by the}} switching inverter {{as a means to}} detect <b>interturn</b> <b>fault.</b> High-frequency (HF) impedance behavior of healthy and faulted windings is analyzed and modeled, and ripple current signature due to interturn faults is quantified. A simple analog circuit is designed to extract the PWM ripple current via a bandpass (BP) filter and a root-mean-square (RMS) detector for fault detection. In addition, this method can also identify the faulted phase, which can be used for fault mitigation strategies. The method is tested experimentally on a five-phase permanent-magnet (PM) machine drive...|$|E

The diagnostic procedure {{is based on}} the symmetrical component theory and relies upon the combined space vector D that gathers information from the two original space vectors obtained with different reference frames. The diagnostic index effectiveness and robustness were also investigated against other fault types such as rotor eccentricities and magnet damage to assess its discrimination capability. The proposed procedure was experimentally evaluated for the <b>interturn</b> <b>fault</b> case on a five-phase PM machine.

40|$|<b>Interturn</b> <b>faults</b> in {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) may develop fast into more severe faults such as coil-to-coil, phase-to-phase and phase-to-ground short circuits. These faults are very destructive and may irreversibly damage the PMSM. Therefore, {{it is highly}} desirable to develop suitable methods for the early detection of such faults. The effects of <b>interturn</b> <b>faults</b> are visible in both the stator currents and the zero-sequence voltage component (ZSVC) spectra. By designing appropriate fault diagnosis schemes based on {{the analysis of the}} harmonic content of such electric variables it is possible to detect short circuit faults in its early stage. However, the stator winding configuration of the PMSM deeply impacts the harmonic content of both spectra. This paper studies the effects of different stator winding configurations in both the stator currents and the ZSVC spectra of healthy and faulty machines. Results presented may help to develop fault diagnosis schemes based on the acquisition and further analysis of the stator currents and/or the ZSVC harmonic components.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{sensitivity of}} Frequency Response Analysis method applied to detection of <b>interturn</b> <b>faults.</b> Frequency {{response has been}} carried out on a special Reduced Scale Traction Transformer (RSTT). The RSTT has the wound iron core and eight coils arranged in the “core ” type of construction. Many papers have been published on FRA techniques for detection of shorted turns but still there are some issues that need to be addressed. The simulated faults presented in the paper include different values of shorting resistance and different localization of short-circuited turns. From the measurements performed on the transformer without faults, it can be concluded that handmade coils with the same type of construction differ significantly in frequency response. It is also concluded that FRA magnitude spectrum is sensitive to short-circuit, but for some ranges of shorting resistance only. FRA magnitude spectrum also changes with respect to localization of short-circuited turns. The frequency response showed shift in waveforms? in case of some resonant frequencies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{benefits}} and drawbacks of a 5 -hp reconfigurable induction motor, {{which was designed}} for experimental emulation of stator winding interturn and broken rotor bar faults, are presented in this paper. It was perceived that this motor had the potential of quick and easy reconfiguration to produce the desired stator and rotor faults {{in a variety of}} different fault combinations. Hence, this motor was anticipated to make a useful test bed for evaluation of the efficacy of existing and new motor fault diagnostics techniques and not the study of insulation failure mechanisms. Accordingly, it was anticipated that this reconfigurable motor would eliminate the need to permanently destroy machine components such as stator windings or rotor bars when acquiring data from a faulty machine for fault diagnostic purposes. Experimental results under healthy and various faulty conditions are presented in this paper, including issues associated with rotor bar-end ring contact resistances that showed the drawbacks of this motor in so far as emulation of rotor bar breakages. However, emulation of stator-turn fault scenarios was successfully accomplished.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} and analyzes a parametric {{model for}} simulating healthy and faulty surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors. It allows studying {{the effects of}} stator winding <b>interturn</b> short-circuit <b>faults.</b> A relevant feature of the developed model is that it deals with spatial harmonics due to a nonsinusoidal rotor permanent magnet configuration. Additionally, the proposed model is valid for studying the behavior of these machines running under nonstationary conditions, including load or speed variations.

40|$|The {{development}} of various topologies and configurations of axial-flux permanent magnet machine has spurred its use for electromechanical energy conversion in several applications. As it becomes increasingly deployed, effective condition monitoring built on reliable and accurate fault detection techniques {{is needed to}} ensure its engineering integrity. Unlike induction machine which has been rigorously investigated for faults, axial-flux permanent magnet machine has not. Thus in this thesis, axial-flux permanent magnet machine is investigated under faulty conditions. Common faults associated with it namely; static eccentricity and interturn short circuit are modelled, and detection techniques are established. The modelling forms a basis for; developing a platform for precise fault replication on a developed experimental test-rig, predicting and analysing fault signatures using both finite element analysis and experimental analysis. In the detection, the motor current signature analysis, vibration analysis and electrical impedance spectroscopy are applied. Attention is paid to fault-feature extraction and fault discrimination. Using both frequency and time-frequency techniques, features are tracked in the line current under steady-state and transient conditions respectively. Results obtained provide rich information on the pattern of fault harmonics. Parametric spectral estimation is also explored {{as an alternative to}} the Fourier transform in the steady-state analysis of faulty conditions. It is found to be as effective as the Fourier transform and more amenable to short signal-measurement duration. Vibration analysis is applied in the detection of eccentricities; its efficacy in fault detection is hinged on proper determination of vibratory frequencies and quantification of corresponding tones. This is achieved using analytical formulations and signal processing techniques. Furthermore, the developed fault model is used to assess the influence of cogging torque minimization techniques and rotor topologies in axial-flux permanent magnet machine on current signal in the presence of static eccentricity. The double-sided topology is found to be tolerant to the presence of static eccentricity unlike the single-sided topology due to the opposing effect of the resulting asymmetrical properties of the airgap. The cogging torque minimization techniques do not impair on the established fault detection technique in the single-sided topology. By applying electrical broadband impedance spectroscopy, <b>interturn</b> <b>faults</b> are diagnosed; a high frequency winding model is developed to analyse the impedance-frequency response obtained...|$|R
40|$|Locating the stator <b>interturn</b> (SIT) <b>fault</b> on {{the motor}} winding {{structure}} adds an important {{feature in the}} fault diagnosis. This motivates to {{study the effects of}} SIT fault location on the induction machine. In this paper, a simple yet accurate stationary reference frame q - d - 0 model of SIT-faulted induction machine, including the fault location parameter, is developed. The fundamental components of winding functions (WFs) are used to calculate the machine inductances for the proposed model. These inductances in stationary reference frame q - d - 0 variables are rotor-position-independent expressions and functions of fault severity and fault location. The proposed model is as accurate as the multiple-coupled-circuit model for fault location study. It does not require the recalculation of machine inductances in each integration step to solve the model. The experimental validation of the model is presented. The steady-state analysis based on the proposed model indicates that the inclination of the current vector locus and the phase angle of the negative-sequence current phasor are the strong indicators of the SIT fault location...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{diagnosis}} method for a multipole permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) under an <b>interturn</b> short circuit <b>fault.</b> Previous works {{in this area}} have suffered from the uncertainties of the PMSM parameters, {{which can lead to}} misdiagnosis. The proposed method estimates the q-axis inductance (Lq) of the faulty PMSM to solve this problem. The proposed method also estimates the faulty phase and the value of G, which serves as an index of the severity of the fault. The q-axis current is used to estimate the faulty phase, the values of G and Lq. For this reason, two open-loop observers and an optimization method based on a particle-swarm are implemented. The q-axis current of a healthy PMSM is estimated by the open-loop observer with the parameters of a healthy PMSM. The Lq estimation significantly compensates for the estimation errors in high-speed operation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can estimate the faulty phase, G, and Lq besides exhibiting robustness against parameter uncertainties...|$|R
