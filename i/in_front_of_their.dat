5|$|It was {{the last}} season that Arsenal played <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> famous North Bank terrace, which was being {{demolished}} over the summer of 1992 {{to make way for}} a new all-seater stand which was scheduled for completion during 1993, by which time Highbury was set to have an all-seater capacity of just under 40,000. These changes were necessary due to the Taylor Report, which required all clubs in the highest two divisions of English football to have an all-seater stadium by August 1994.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-11 and its planets were {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness {{can be interpreted}} as planets whose orbits move <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> stars from the perspective of Earth. Kepler-11 is the first discovered exoplanetary system with more than three transiting planets.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-9d's {{name comes}} from it being the third planet {{discovered}} in the orbit of Kepler-9. Kepler-9 was named for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA satellite that aims to discover terrestrial planets in transit around, or crossing <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of,</b> <b>their</b> host stars as seen from Earth. This transit causes a regular interval in which the star briefly and slightly dims as the planet crosses it.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{fourteen}} killed, {{including the}} captain, and 44 wounded, while the French suffered five killed and ten wounded. The privateers were then granted {{one hour of}} free pillaging on Kent before Surcouf restored order; however, the female passengers were strictly protected and sentries were placed <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> apartments. Amongst the prisoners were General Frederick St. John and his wife, Arabella Craven.|$|E

5|$|The Manchester City team {{returned}} to Manchester the following evening. They travelled by train to Wilmslow, {{from where they}} undertook a 13-mile parade in an open-topped bus. 25,000 people lined the route, with a further 3,000 people in Albert Square, where the parade finished. Three days later, the team paraded the cup <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> supporters before their match against West Ham United at Maine Road.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} prompted Pakistan {{to ask the}} two Australian {{players to}} appear <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own judicial inquiry into corruption; Australia responded by granting the Pakistanis permission to hold hearings in Australia with full privileges. The players were questioned about their accusations against Malik, and whether their dealings with John detracted from their credibility. Both Waugh and Warne denied any suggestions they played with less determination in the matches in question, stating that {{they were among the}} leading players in those games.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ritual}} the priest {{delivers}} a short sermon, {{followed by the}} church choir singing Christmas songs; poems that praise the Nativity of Jesus Christ may be recited. In Montenegro, decasyllable Serbian epics are sung to an accompaniment played on the gusle, a traditional Serbian bowed string instrument. The celebration ends with parishioners gathered around the fire, served with cooked rakia, wine, or tea, and the food allowed during the Nativity Fast. Parishioners may pick a twig from the badnjak and take it home to place <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> icon, or at another appropriate location.|$|E

5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by {{a little more than}} a degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system is probably more coplanar (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{consists}} of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own goal. Though {{there are a variety}} of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 b {{was one of}} {{a sample}} of over 300 very-low-mass stars {{targeted}} by astronomers in search of planets that may orbit such stars. Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at La Silla Observatory in Chile, six years of radial velocity data led the astronomers in the discovery of eleven other planets. After these discoveries, the astronomers chose to refocus their search on short-period planets, hoping to follow up after discoveries using the radial velocity method with a search for planets that also transited, or crossed <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of,</b> <b>their</b> host stars as seen from Earth.|$|E
25|$|Although the Russian {{force was}} more {{numerous}} than the Polish units {{left in the}} city after the Polish–Russian War of 1792, Russian soldiers were dispersed all around the city, guarding numerous warehouses or manning outposts <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> residences <b>of</b> <b>their</b> officers. In addition, their orders {{in case of an}} armed uprising were often contradictory and did {{not take into account the}} possibility of fighting against regular Polish units.|$|R

5|$|HAT-P-33b's {{existence}} was first suggested after observations by the six-telescope HATnet collaboration, {{a project that}} searches the sky for planets in transit of, or crossing <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of,</b> <b>their</b> host stars. The presence of a planet in HAT-P-33's orbit had been suspected as early as 2004, although high levels of jitter were detected. This jitter, or a random and shaky appearance that clouds the accuracy of measurements, {{made it difficult to}} easily verify the radial velocity of the planetary candidate's host star, which usually leads summarily to the planet's confirmation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1962–63 NBA season, Baylor {{was back}} full-time. West {{averaged}} 27.8points, 7.0rebounds and 5.6assists and was again NBA All-Star and All-NBA First-Team; however, {{he played in}} only 55 regular season games, missing the last seven weeks due to a hamstring injury. Again, the Lakers reached the finals, and again, they battled the Celtics. With West not yet in shape, Baylor and the Lakers fell back 3–2; then they succumbed in Game 6 <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> home crowd with a 112–109 loss. As the game ended, veteran Celtics playmaker Bob Cousy threw the ball high into the rafters of the L.A. Sports Arena.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-5 {{is named}} so {{because it was}} the fifth planet-bearing star {{discovered}} {{during the course of the}} Kepler Mission, a NASA operation that seeks to discover Earth-like planets that transit, or cross <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of,</b> <b>their</b> host stars with respect to Earth. The star's planet, Kepler-5b, was the second of the first five planets to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets found by Kepler were used as tests, and had already been discovered. Kepler-5b was presented to the public on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C., along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-6, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8.|$|E

These characteristics were possibly unusual at the time.|$|R
5000|$|For {{personnel}} {{within the}} Royal Canadian Air Force, the blue wedge cap (French: calot) is authorized for wear with all orders of dress, {{save for the}} combat uniform. It is properly worn [...] "on {{the right side of}} the head, centred front and back, with the <b>front</b> edge <b>of</b> the cap 2.5 cm above the right eyebrow." [...] Cap badges are worn on the left side, with the centre of the badge 6.5 cm from the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the cap centred between the flap and the top seam. The cap worn by general officers is embellished with silver piping. Air force military police in dress uniform wear a scarlet flash <b>in</b> the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> wedge caps showing 1 cm. Air force members of Canadian Special Operations Forces Command wear a tan flash <b>in</b> the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> wedge caps.|$|R
5|$|Kepler-6 {{was named}} for the Kepler Mission, a NASA and {{accomplishment}} project launched in 2009 that aims to discover Earth-like planets that transit, or cross <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of,</b> <b>their</b> home stars with respect to Earth. Unlike stars like the Sun or Sirius, Kepler-6 {{does not have a}} common and colloquial name. The discovery of Kepler-6b was announced by the Kepler team on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8. It was the third planet to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets to be verified by data from Kepler had been previously discovered. These three planets were used to test the accuracy of Kepler's measurements.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-8b is {{the fifth}} of the first five exoplanets {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, which aims to discover planets in a region of the sky between the constellations Lyra and Cygnus that transit (cross <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of)</b> <b>their</b> host stars. The planet is the hottest of the five. Kepler-8b was the only planet discovered in Kepler-8's orbit, and is larger (though more diffuse) than Jupiter. It orbits its host star every 3.5 days. The planet also demonstrates the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, where the planet's orbit affects the redshifting of the spectrum of the host star. Kepler-8b was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 {{at a conference in}} Washington, D.C. after radial velocity measurements conducted at the W.M. Keck Observatory confirmed its detection by Kepler.|$|E
5|$|Lee's army now dug {{in around}} Petersburg, Virginia {{and the long}} Siege of Petersburg {{commenced}} with several frontal assaults on the Confederate position. The 22nd {{took part in the}} assault on June 18, 1864. Again the regiment was deployed as skirmishers <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> brigade. They were ordered to take a ravine alongside the Norfolk Railroad. Advancing at a run in the face of heavy canister fire, the 22nd reached the ravine. However, in that position they were subjected to severe musket and artillery fire from the Confederates, and so they pushed forward to the Norfolk Railroad cut, forcing the Confederates back to their entrenchments. In the assault on Petersburg, the 22nd lost seven killed and 14 wounded.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{the biblical}} shewbread, the Babylonians and Assyrians {{generally}} laid twelve cakes/loaves, or an integer multiple of twelve cakes/loaves, on tables <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> images <b>of</b> <b>their</b> deities; the number twelve, {{which is so}} prominent in the shewbread rite, has always borne mysterious religious significance, and with the Assyrian practice of laying out twelve cakes/loaves, [...] was directly connected with the Zodiac. The Babylonian cakes/bread were also required to be sweet (i.e. unleavened), and like the biblical shewbread were baked from wheat flour.|$|R
50|$|In France and Belgium, an avoué was {{formerly}} a jurist and a ministerial officer charged with performing the preparation (postulation) <b>of</b> cases <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> courts. <b>Their</b> functions were {{roughly equivalent to}} that of solicitors in common law systems, {{but only in the}} context of litigation.
