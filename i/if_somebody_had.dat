500|$|After days {{of media}} speculation, it was {{confirmed}} on September 6, 2007 that Spears {{would open the}} 2007 MTV Video Music Awards at the Pearl Theatre in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on September 9, 2007. It was also announced {{that she was going}} to perform [...] "Gimme More", with a magic act from illusionist Criss Angel in some parts of the performance. However, the bit is thought to have been rejected by the show's organisers at the last minute. The performance began with Spears lip synching the first lines of Elvis Presley's 1958 song [...] "Trouble". [...] "Gimme More" [...] began, and the camera panned out to reveal Spears wearing a black, jewel-encrusted bikini and black boots. She was accompanied by male and female dancers dressed in black outfits. Several pole dancers danced in smaller stages around the audience. The performance was universally panned by critics. Jeff Leeds of The New York Times said that [...] "no one was prepared for Sunday night's fiasco, in which a listless Ms. Spears teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words in a wan attempt to lip-synch her new single". Vinay Menon of the Toronto Star commented Spears [...] "looked hopelessly dazed. She was wearing the expression of somebody who had been deposited at the Palms Casino Resort by a tornado, one that promptly twisted away, taking her clothing and sense of purpose. [...] lumbering, in slow motion, as <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>had</b> poured cement into her streetwalker boots". David Willis of BBC stated her performance would [...] "go down in the history books as being one of the worst to grace the MTV Awards".|$|E

The day after the performance, American blogger Chris Crocker posted a video in YouTube titled [...] "Leave Britney alone!", in which he cried and defended Spears's performance, explaining {{that he did not want}} her to spiral out of control like Anna Nicole Smith, who had died in February 2007. Within the first 24 hours of its posting, the video accumulated over 2 million views. [...] "Leave Britney alone!" [...] turned Crocker into an internet celebrity, and was featured on television shows such as The View and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. It was also parodied by dozens of other YouTube users, most famously by actor Seth Green. An editor for YouTube said [...] "the melodramatic two-minute clip made Crocker an instant YouTube star" [...] and named it one of the top videos of 2007. Wired named it the top video of 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Talking to Der Spiegel in 2015, Cleese {{expressed}} a critical view {{on what he}} saw as a plutocracy that was unhealthily developing control of the governance of the First World's societies, stating that he had reached a point when he [...] "saw that our existence here is absolutely hopeless.

That innings put Richards into his right perspective. He was the closest thing to an insurance policy against defeat that anybody could take out.

[...] He added, [...] "In the military, it's like we're trained to hesitate now. <b>If</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>had</b> seen something wrong and shot, {{he probably would have}} been court-martialed".

50|$|On December 9, 2008, the IRS gave 403(b) plan {{sponsors}} {{a one-year}} reprieve for adopting a written plan document. A 403(b) plan, {{also known as}} a tax-sheltered annuity plan, is a retirement plan for employees of specific tax-exempt organizations such as health care organizations and colleges and universities. While the relief provisions from the IRS give 403(b) a full year to adopt a written plan document, the plans still must operate in compliance with 403(b) plan requirements. <b>If</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> taken 403(b) plan and his age is less than 59 then he cannot initiate a withdrawal from annuity. If he wants to initiate then he has to show a triggering event such as financial hardship, disability, or separation from service. The IRS also charges a mandatory 10% as federal taxes on an early withdrawal before it is additionally taxed as ordinary income.|$|R

5000|$|Gross {{negligence}} is the [...] "lack of slight diligence or care" [...] or [...] "a conscious, {{voluntary act}} or omission in reckless disregard {{of a legal}} duty and of the consequences to another party, who may typically recover exemplary damages". Negligence {{is the opposite of}} diligence, or being careful. The standard of ordinary negligence is what conduct deviates from the proverbial [...] "reasonable person". By extension, <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> been grossly negligent, that means they have fallen so far below the ordinary standard of care that one can expect, to warrant the label of being [...] "gross". Prosser and Keeton describe gross negligence as being [...] "the want of even slight or scant care", and note it as having been described as a lack of care that even a careless person would use. They further note that while some jurisdictions equate the culpability of gross negligence with that of recklessness, most simply differentiate it from simple negligence in its degree.|$|R

6000|$|... "Surely, {{you see the}} {{importance}} of using your niece's keys?" [...] he resumed.

50|$|Mainstage bingo can {{be played}} as a link, {{in the same way}} that Mechanised Cash Bingo is played as a link (see below). This allows more prize money to be offered per game. One person from one club is the caller, and his or her voice is {{broadcast}} across all clubs taking part in the link. At all Gala Bingo clubs in the UK, the 'Last Chance' is a two-page book of 6 tickets which is played across around 30 clubs. People play the game in exactly the same way as ordinary mainstage bingo, and the same game rules apply. The prize money is £100 for a line, £100 for two lines and £100 for a full house during afternoon sessions and £200 for a line, £200 for two lines and £200 for a full house during evening sessions across both pages of the book. <b>If</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> a claim, they are still required to shout. The host of the winning club then turns their microphone on and says 'claim in...' followed by the name of the club, which stops gameplay so that the claim can be checked.|$|R
