40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} truly {{practical}} and provably optimal O(n log h) time outputsensitive algorithm for the planar convex hull problem. The basic algorithm {{is similar to the}} algorithm presented in Chan, Snoeyink and Yap[2] where the median-finding step is replaced by an approximate median. We analyze two such schemes and show that for both methods, the algorithm runs in expected O(n log h) time. The expected number of comparisons can be made smaller than 5 n log h for the upper-hull. We further show that the probability of deviation from <b>expected</b> running <b>time</b> <b>approaches</b> 0 rapidly with increasing values of n and h for any input. Our experiments suggest that this algorithm is a practical alternative to the worstcase O(n log n) algorithms like Graham's and especially faster for small output-sizes. Our approach bears some resemblance to a recent algorithm of Wenger[13] but our analysis is substantially different. 1 Introduction The planar convex hull problem is perhaps the most stud [...] ...|$|R

Our problem formulation is motivated by scenarios involving autonomous vehicles circulating on arterial roads with intelligent management at traffic intersections. We propose a provably correct distributed control algorithm that ensures that the vehicles satisfy the finite-time specifications under speed limits, acceleration saturation, and safety requirements. The safety specifications are such that collisions can be avoided even in cases of communication failure. We also discuss how the proposed distributed algorithm can be integrated with an intelligent intersection manager {{to provide information about}} the feasible <b>approach</b> <b>times</b> of the vehicle string and a guaranteed bound of its time of occupancy of the intersection.
