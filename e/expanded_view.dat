25|$|Hartelius, Caplan and Rardin {{conducted}} {{a retrospective analysis}} of definitions of transpersonal psychology. They found three dominant themes that define the field: beyond-ego psychology, integrative/holistic psychology, and psychology of transformation. Analysis suggested that the field has moved from an early emphasis on alternative states of consciousness to a more <b>expanded</b> <b>view</b> of human wholeness and transformation. This development has, according to the authors, moved the field closer to the integral approaches of Ken Wilber and Post-Aurobindonian theorists.|$|E
500|$|Much of Janáček's work {{displays}} great originality and individuality. It {{employs a}} vastly <b>expanded</b> <b>view</b> of tonality, uses unorthodox chord spacings and structures, and often, modality: [...] "there is no music without key. Atonality abolishes definite key, and thus tonal modulation....Folksong knows of no atonality." [...] Janáček features accompaniment figures and patterns, with (according to Jim Samson) [...] "the on-going {{movement of his}} music...similarly achieved by unorthodox means; often a discourse of short, 'unfinished' phrases comprising constant repetitions of short motifs which gather momentum in a cumulative manner." [...] Janáček named these motifs [...] "sčasovka" [...] in his theoretical works. [...] "Sčasovka" [...] has no strict English equivalent, but John Tyrrell, a leading specialist on Janáček's music, describes it as [...] "a little flash of time, almost a kind of musical capsule, which Janáček often used in slow music as tiny swift motifs with remarkably characteristic rhythms {{that are supposed to}} pepper the musical flow." [...] Janáček's use of these repeated motifs demonstrates a remote similarity to minimalist composers (Sir Charles Mackerras called Janáček [...] "the first minimalist composer").|$|E

40|$|Research Areas: Graphics and Human-computer interactionImage {{browsing}} {{and searching}} {{are some of}} the most common tasks in daily computer use. Zooming techniques are important for image searching and browsing in a large collection of thumbnail images in a single screen. In this paper we investigate the design and usability of different zoom-in-context views for image browsing and searching. We present two new zoom-in-context <b>views,</b> sliding and <b>expanding</b> <b>views,</b> that can help users explore a large collection of images more efficiently and enjoyably. In the sliding view the zoomed image moves its neighbors away vertically and horizontally. In the <b>expanding</b> <b>view,</b> the nearby images are pushed away in all directions, and this method uses a Voronoi diagram to compute the positions of the neighbors. We also present the results of a user study that compared the usability of the two zoom-in-context views and an overlapping, non-context zoom in the tasks of searching to match an image or a text description, and the task of brochure making. Although the task completion times were not significantly different, users expressed a preference for the zoom-in-context methods over the standard non-context zoom for text-matching image search and for image browsing tasks...|$|R
