2500|$|The Limited Edition option {{package was}} offered for GT and GTP models made this year. This {{optional}} package consisted of unique blue-tinted glass <b>fog</b> <b>light</b> lenses, [...] "Limited Edition" [...] badging, carbon fiber instrument cluster, two-tone cloth/leather interior, and a raised spoiler resembling the original GT/GTP/SE spoiler set atop three aerodynamic pillars.|$|R
25|$|It was {{released}} mainly with three trim levels: E, S and SE. The latter had air conditioning, wheel covers, body-colored bumpers, rear spoiler, <b>fog</b> <b>lights</b> and a stereo, with optional {{features such as}} roof rails, power steering, central locking, electric front windows, ABS and driver airbag. In certain markets it was also available with an automatic transmission.|$|E
25|$|Its {{appearance}} is slightly different from its sister-car, the Porsche 911 (997) Turbo, {{in a few}} ways. It does not have <b>fog</b> <b>lights</b> in the front bumper, it has a revised front lip, it has a larger rear wing (with two small air scoops on either side), {{and it has a}} different rear bumper (now featuring titanium exhaust pipes).|$|E

25|$|In 2006 (2007 US model year) the Prius added side-curtain {{air bags}} (standard on all models). A Touring Edition was introduced, with an {{elongated}} and larger rear spoiler {{as well as}} larger, sharper-pointed, seven-spoke, 16", magnesium wheels with plastic hubcap covers {{to protect them from}} scratches when parking against the curb.

25|$|The facelifted Fabia and Fabia Combi were premiered at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. Updated version can {{be easily}} {{distinguished}} by different shape of front bumper and front <b>fog</b> <b>lights.</b> Inside, new steering wheels were the tell-tales. Though their shape remained the same, headlights with projector module undergone technical changes: for full beam, a separate reflector is fitted {{on the inner side}} of the lamp, while the projector module providing a dimmed beam is on the outer side.|$|E
25|$|All coupes {{came with}} a vinyl roof as standard. Since the coupe lacked B-pillars, the roof flexed enough that the paint used by Jaguar at the time would develop cracks. More modern paints do not suffer such problems, so {{whenever}} a coupe is repainted it is viable to remove the vinyl. Today many XJ-Cs no longer have their vinyl roof, also removing the threat of roof rust. Some owners also modified their XJ-C by changing to Series III bumpers. This lifted the front indicators from under the bumper and provided built in rear <b>fog</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
50|$|The RM500 is a Genesis Coupe with 5.0-liter Tau V8 engine rated 450 hp, {{built by}} Rhys Millen Racing.

A driver's blind spot mirror was added and a new Driver Selectable Steering Mode is standard on the Limited and Sport models.|$|R
40|$|Based on the Monge-Kantorovich {{theory of}} optimal mass transport, the {{computation}} of a ray mapping between source and target irradiances {{is used to}} design two-sided freeform lenses fulfilling the constraints of an automotive application: compactness and sharp bright-dark cutoff. A generic segmentation technic resulting in Fresnel-type optics is presented and the whole procedure is illustrated with {{the design of a}} <b>fog</b> <b>light</b> lens. Finally Monte Carlo simulation of the virtual model and measurements of a polycarbonate prototype are presented...|$|R
25|$|The 2003 Saturn Ion quad coupe {{production}} car first {{appeared at the}} 2002 New York International Auto Show. The 2003 Ion came standard with a 2.2 L 140hp (104kW) DOHC Ecotec I4 engine. The Ion's instrument panel was mounted on the top center of the dashboard, rather than behind the steering wheel. The Ion is available in sedan level 1, 2, or 3; level three signified a more user friendly setup with power windows and power locks, while lower levels included crank windows and plastic wheel covers. Other extras included <b>fog</b> <b>lights,</b> sunroof, and spoiler. The Saturn Ion Quad Coupe has half-sized rear suicide doors while the sedan has conventionally hinged doors.|$|E
25|$|The Australian U13 Bluebirds were {{available}} in three different models, LX—the base model but very well equipped, Ti—the luxury model, and the SSS—the sports model. Compared to the LX, the Ti had climate control, a sunroof, woodgrain styling, and gear selector display on the instrument cluster (automatic models only). while comparing the LX to the SSS, the SSS had a HUD (heads-up display—digital speedo on windscreen), climate control, <b>fog</b> <b>lights,</b> ski-port, woodgrain styling, and gear selector display on the instrument cluster (automatic models only). Despite there being a sports model (SSS), the LX was the fastest of the Australian models due to having the least weight. The engine used in the Australian and US U13 models was the KA24DE (112kW, 210Nm of torque).|$|E
25|$|Compared to the Lexus RX 330 and RX 350, the RX 400h {{featured}} a different front grille and round <b>fog</b> <b>lights,</b> and also differently styled LED taillights {{in place of}} the conventional LED ones on the RX 330/RX 350. Different exterior colors were offered. In 2007, Hybrid badging was added to the rear side doors. The RX 400h interior {{featured a}} hybrid information display on the navigation screen showing electrical motor, gasoline engine, and regenerative braking activation in real time. Some RX 400h models without navigation screens displayed the information on a small monochrome display on the instrument panel. When launched in 2005, the RX 400h came exclusively with brushed aluminum interior accents, {{in place of the}} wood trim offered in the standard RX. This changed in 2006, when the RX 400h became available with Bird's Eye Maple wood trim.|$|E
50|$|The Opel GT {{roadster}} {{differs from}} the Saturn Sky in very few, but subtle areas. It features a cigarette lighter on the driver's side door, two ashtrays (one on each door), a passenger-side storage cubby (instead of a speaker grate, behind the passenger seat), and a rear <b>fog</b> <b>light.</b> Opel made these changes {{to appeal to the}} European market, and because in Europe the Opel GT was considerably more expensive than the Saturn Sky, due to its captive-import status.|$|R
50|$|There is {{no simple}} {{relationship}} between the scattering cross section and the physical size of the particles, as the scattering cross section depends on the wavelength of radiation used. This can be seen when driving in foggy weather: the droplets of water (which form the <b>fog)</b> scatter red <b>light</b> less than they scatter the shorter wavelengths present in white light, and the red rear <b>fog</b> <b>light</b> can be distinguished more clearly than the white headlights of an approaching vehicle. That {{is to say that}} the scattering cross section of the water droplets is smaller for red light than for light of shorter wavelengths, even though the physical size of the particles is the same.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Fog</b> Point <b>Light</b> was a {{historic}} lighthouse located at Fog Point, the northwestern tip of Smith Island, Maryland in the Chesapeake Bay.|$|R
