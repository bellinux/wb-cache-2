5|$|Buemi was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} session; his best lap time of 1.38:586 was half a second off Vettel's pace in the second session. He was {{disappointed}} as he had Barrichello ahead of him driving towards turn 25 on his final timed lap which caused Buemi to reduce his speed and it cost him two tenths of a second. Rosberg took 12th position. Sutil had no grip {{in his car and}} qualified in 13th. His teammate Liuzzi clinched 14th place' he was affected by oversteer and struggled with driving on his car's soft tyres. Schumacher was unable to get his tyres working to his preference and was affected with a right-front brake problem which restricted him to qualifying in 15th. Schumacher's qualifying effort was criticised by the Formula One paddock. Pedro de la Rosa took 16th having struggled with a lack of grip on the super soft compound tyres. Jaime Alguersuari drove hard but experienced a lack of top speed and clinched 17th. Kamui Kobayashi failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session; he flat-spotted his front super soft compound tyres on his first timed lap which caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> vibrations in his car. The two Lotus cars of Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen qualified in 19th and 20th positions, ahead of both Virgin drivers Lucas di Grassi and Timo Glock in 21st and 22nd. Both Hispania drivers lined up {{at the back of the}} field (with Karun Chandhok ahead of Senna).|$|E
25|$|Stoner {{remained}} with Ducati for the 2009 season with new teammate Nicky Hayden, with a further option for a 4th season in 2010. A strong {{start to the}} season left Stoner in a three-way battle with the Fiat Yamaha duo of Rossi and Jorge Lorenzo, before {{he was struck by}} a mystery illness which caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> tired long before the end of races, leaving him 16 points behind Rossi and 7 behind Lorenzo after the US Grand Prix at Laguna Seca on 5 July.|$|E
25|$|Interactionism is {{the view}} that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally {{interact}} with physical states. This is a position which is very appealing to common-sense intuitions, notwithstanding {{the fact that it}} is very difficult to establish its validity or correctness by way of logical argumentation or empirical proof. It seems to appeal to common-sense because we are surrounded by such everyday occurrences as a child's touching a hot stove (physical event) which causes <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> pain (mental event) and then yell and scream (physical event) which causes his parents to experience a sensation of fear and protectiveness (mental event) and so on.|$|E

25|$|Film {{critics have}} cited Curly {{as the most}} popular member of the team. His childlike mannerisms and natural comedic charm (he had no {{previous}} acting experience) made him a hit with audiences, particularly children and women (the latter usually finding the trio's humor juvenile and uncouth). The fact that Curly had to shave his head for the act led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> unappealing to women. To mask his insecurities, he ate and drank to excess and caroused whenever the Stooges made personal appearances, which was approximately seven months of each year. His weight ballooned in the 1940s, and his blood pressure became dangerously high. Curly's wild lifestyle and constant drinking eventually {{caught up with him}} in 1945, and his performances suffered.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} Timmy Martin was reprised for the 1989 syndicated series The New Lassie. Provost {{returned to}} play the role of Timmy, who was now an adult who went by the name Steve McCullough. In the seventh episode of the series June Lockhart also reprises her role as Ruth Martin, and viewers are told that Timmy was never properly adopted by the Martins. As such he was left behind when Paul and Ruth emigrated to Australia at the end of the original Lassie, causing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> extremely bitter towards the Martins, and changed to using his real first name of Steve instead of his middle name Timmy, and took on his new adoptive parents last name. At the end of the episode, he reconciles with his former adoptive mother.|$|E
25|$|Several issues {{brought about}} this melancholic state and {{restricted}} his poetic inspiration {{during the last}} five years of his life. His work load was extremely heavy. He disliked living in Dublin, away from England and friends; he was also disappointed at how far the city had fallen from its Georgian elegance of the previous century. His general health deteriorated as his eyesight began to fail. He felt confined and dejected. As a devout Jesuit, he found himself in an artistic dilemma. To subdue any egotism which would violate the humility required by his religious position, he decided never to publish his poems. But Hopkins realized that any true poet requires an audience for criticism and encouragement. This conflict between his religious obligations and his poetic talent caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that he had failed them both.|$|E

500|$|... "Cry Over Me" [...] is, {{according}} to Meat Loaf, a timeless song dealing with relationships of all kinds. In a 2007 interview, {{he says that}} it can be about your first or last loves, or dealing with your boss at work. Partially quoting the lyrics, the singer posits that there are times when [...] "you want <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> exactly like I felt when he said that to me." ...|$|E
500|$|He started {{alongside}} Hall of Fame center Dave Cowens, {{who enjoyed}} playing with Washington, remarking, [...] "It's great fun, {{you can always}} hear him grunt when he's rebounding." [...] Auerbach said, [...] "Kermit was fighting a battle he couldn't win. Nothing he could say or do {{was going to change}} the way people perceived him because of that moment. I wanted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> at home with us, to feel wanted." [...] Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.|$|E
500|$|... "The Open Boat" [...] {{directly}} references Lady Caroline Norton's 1883 poem [...] "Bingen on the Rhine", {{which focuses}} {{on the death of}} a French Foreign Legionnaire, far from home, while grasping the hand of a comrade. Recalling the poem, the correspondent sees how the soldier's dire circumstances mirror his own, leading <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> sorry for the anonymous poetic figure; noting the similarities between the dying soldier and the shipwrecked correspondent, critics such as Edward Stone and Max Westbrook believe this realization causes the correspondent to discover the necessity for human sympathy in an uncaring world. While the literary reference may be considered ironic, unsympathetic, and only of minor interest, Stone for one argued that this poem may also have served as a source for The Red Badge of Courage, which also explores man's relationship with the metaphysical.|$|E

500|$|McClymont's work {{experiences}} caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> disastified {{with the}} quality of education he had received in his degree program at Sydney. [...] He felt the veterinary science specialization was too narrow, especially in the area of animal husbandry and livestock production. [...] Moreover, he felt the specialization of the discipline did not provide sufficient knowledge in how the overall farm animal production process worked. [...] For example, as an undergraduate, he received only three lectures on statistics, a skill he had to teach himself during his first few years as an animal nutritionist advisor. [...] As a result, he took an interest in education and curriculum development. [...] McClymont later said that he had [...] "seen the educational deficiencies of narrow specialization, whether of veterinary graduates as specialists in animal health and disease or of agricultural science graduates as specialists in aspects of soil and plants. [...] I had seen the problems created by such specialized knowledge when exercised without overall understanding." ...|$|E
500|$|A police {{psychiatrist}} who interviewed LÃ©pine's family and entourage, {{and who had}} access to his letters, suggested {{that he may have}} had a serious personality disorder, as he chose the multiple homicide/suicide strategy (killing oneself after killing others) that is a characteristic of this disorder. The psychiatrist noted [...] "extreme narcissistic vulnerability" [...] as shown by fantasies of power and success combined with high levels of self-criticism and difficulties dealing with rejection and failure. Feelings of powerlessness and incompetence were compensated for by a violent and grandiose imaginary life. Other psychiatrists suggested that LÃ©pine was psychotic, having lost touch with reality as he tried to erase the memories of a brutal (and absent) father, {{while at the same time}} unconsciously identifying with a violent manhood that dominates women. Other theories were that LÃ©pine's experiences of abuse as a child had caused brain-damage or led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> victimized as he faced losses and rejections in his later life.|$|E
500|$|Curtis {{stated that}} casting an actor to play Van Gogh was done carefully, {{as he wanted}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> to the {{audience}} as Van Gogh, not [...] "like a bloke theyâ€™ve seen acting lots of other parts, in an orange wig". Tony Curran was ultimately cast as the part; Curtis called him a [...] "wonderful actor" [...] who [...] "really could not look more like" [...] Van Gogh. Curran, Smith and Gillan {{got to know each}} other very well, which Gillan hoped would be evident in their chemistry in the episode. Bill Nighy appears uncredited as the MusÃ©e d'Orsay's expert on Van Gogh. Nighy was rumoured to have been considered for the role of the Ninth Doctor when the show was revived. Campbell stated that they were [...] "very fortunate" [...] to have Nighy in the role, who he believed was someone people paid attention to, and the audience needed to pay attention to his character as he said facts which would become important later in the story.|$|E
5000|$|Baek Nam-bong is a handsome, thirty-something {{professor}} of psychology by day and bartender by night, and he is nicknamed [...] "Dr. Frost" [...] because of his prematurely white hair. He sustained a frontal lobe injury in his childhood, which heightened his reasoning centers to genius-level, but left <b>him</b> unable <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> empathy, love, sorrow and other emotional responses.|$|R

500|$|As {{predicted}} by Marc LÃ©pine in his suicide letter, some saw the event as the isolated {{act of a}} madman. A psychiatrist interviewed LÃ©pine's {{family and friends and}} examined his writings as part of the police investigation. He noted that Marc LÃ©pine defined suicide as his primary motivation, and that he chose a specific suicide method, namely killing oneself after killing others (multiple homicide/suicide strategy), which is considered a sign of a serious personality disorder. [...] Other psychiatrists emphasized the traumatic events of his childhood, suggesting that the blows he had received may have caused brain damage, or that LÃ©pine was psychotic, having lost touch with reality as he tried to erase the memories of a brutal (yet largely absent) father while unconsciously identifying with a violent masculinity that dominated women. A different theory was that LÃ©pine's childhood experiences of abuse led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> victimized as he faced losses and rejections in his later life. His mother wondered if LÃ©pine might have suffered from attachment disorder, due to the abuse and sense of abandonment he had experienced in his childhood.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{that the city}} of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond {{between me and my}} city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E
500|$|The alpha male stops its {{attack on}} the glass door, making a butterfly-shaped smear on it. Neville realizes the alpha male is {{identifying}} the female upon which he was experimenting by a butterfly tattoo, and the Darkseekers simply want her back. Amazed {{that they have the}} intelligence to try and communicate to him, as he had previously believed the infected had lost all humanity, Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. After Neville wakes the female up, she cries upon seeing the alpha male and they rub heads. Neville softly apologizes, having realised that while the Darkseekers are no longer human, they still retain some of their humanity and emotions. The alpha male keeps the other Darkseekers back and orders them to leave. Shocked by the ordeal, Neville sits down for a moment in his laboratory, realizing that he was the monster in the Darkseekers' eyes. Looking over the pictures of his numerous test subjects, the implications of his research methods begin to dawn on him, causing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> remorse and relief at the same time. The following day, Neville, Anna, and Ethan drive away from the city under a new broadcast, recorded by Anna, with a message to any human survivors that they [...] "are not alone".|$|E
60|$|His very senses ached {{with the}} longing to clasp {{her in his}} arms, to draw her <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> her pulses beat closer against his. It was almost torture now to gaze upon her beauty--that small, oval face, almost like a child's, the large eyes which at times had seemed to be blue but which now {{appeared}} to be a deep, unfathomable colour, like the tempestuous sea.|$|R
60|$|Overcoming the repugnance {{natural to}} {{one who had}} never before touched a dead body, I stooped and turned <b>him</b> over <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> for his heart. He was quite dead.

It was the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose conveyance I had taken.|$|R

500|$|... "You Are Not Alone" [...] is a R ballad {{about love}} and isolation. The song was written by R. Kelly and {{produced}} by Kelly and Jackson. Kelly wrote the song after losing close people in his life. Kelly was delighted {{to be able to}} work with his idol, explaining [...] "I was psyched... I feel I could have done his whole album. Not being selfish. I was just that geeked about it. It was an experience out of this world... It's amazing to know that five years ago I was writing songs in a basement in the ghetto and now I'm writing for Michael Jackson... I'd be a fool not to say it's a dream come true." [...] Jackson contacted Kelly to see if he had any material available. Kelly forwarded a tape recording of the song and Jackson then agreed to work with Kelly on the piece. On the tape sent to Jackson, Kelly sung [...] "You Are Not Alone" [...] mimicking Jackson's vocal style, explaining, [...] "I think I am him. I become him. I want <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that as well." [...] Jackson found the interpretation amusing. They spent the last week of November 1994 together in the studio working on the track.|$|E
500|$|Inspiration {{to work on}} Her Story {{stemmed from}} Barlow's {{disappointment}} of other detectives games: he felt that L.A. Noire (2011) never allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like [...] "the awesome detective who was having to read things and follow up threads of investigation", and he called the Ace Attorney series (2001â€“present) [...] "rigidity". When Barlow began development on Her Story, he added more typical game aspects, but the game mechanics became more minimalist as development progressed. The initial plan for the game was for players to work towards a definitive resolution, ultimately solving the crime. However, when Barlow tested the concept on pre-existing interview transcripts of convicted murderer Christopher Porco, he began to discover themes surfacing within the interviews, particularly relating {{to the concept of}} money, which was ultimately a large factor in Porco's trial. He took this concept of recurring themes and threads, and decided to [...] "move beyond the clearly scripted stuff" [...] when developing Her Story. Barlow felt that the story's appeal was the ambiguity of the investigation, comparing Her Story to the podcast Serial (2014â€“present), which he listened to late in development. He found that the attraction of Serial was the lack of a definitive solution, noting that [...] "people lean towards certain interpretations ... what makes it interesting {{is the extent to which}} it lives on in your imagination".|$|E
500|$|Chloe and Clark patch their {{relationship}} in the season three episode [...] "Whisper", after Clark discovers {{that she has been}} helping Lionel. When Chloe stops her investigation, Lionel has her fired from the Daily Planet, and also fires her father from his job at LuthorCorp. In season three's [...] "Forsaken", Chloe decides to assist Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), Lionel's son, with getting Lionel arrested for the murder of Lex' grandparents; Chloe's hope is to get out from under Lionel's control. In the season three finale, the F.B.I. place Chloe and her father in a safe-house until Lionel's trial; unfortunately, the safe-house explodes once Chloe and her father enter and they are presumed dead. Chloe's cousin, Lois Lane (Erica Durance), comes to Smallville to investigate Chloe's death in the fourth season premiere. In season four's [...] "Gone", Clark and Lois team-up and discover that Lex's security team found the explosives in the safe-house, pulled Chloe and her father to safety before they detonated, and that he has been hiding her ever since. After Chloe's testimony in the same episode, Lionel is convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. In the season four episode [...] "Pariah", Chloe discovers Clark's secret when Alicia Baker (Sarah Carter), Clark's girlfriend, decides that it needs to be exposed to the world in order for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more comfortable about who he really is. Alicia hopes that Chloe will write a story exposing Clark, but Chloe decides that Clark kept his secret for a reason and decides not to write the story.|$|E

50|$|The Ollamh casts a spell which binds {{his desire}} and makes <b>him</b> unable <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the lust and pain {{he has been}} {{fighting}} throughout the series.
