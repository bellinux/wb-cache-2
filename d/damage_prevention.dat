Hence, there has long been interest in developing additional tools to preclude snakes leaving in cargo, and fumigation with essential oils has been suggested for this role. We tested gaseous or aerosol deliveries of several essential oils and three other candidate irritants. We found none to work reliably in repelling snakes, and we discuss several limitations that make development of an effective fumigation tool from these chemicals improbable. Additional effort to develop an operational tool using essential oils would likely be misdirected, and effective fumigation methods for invasive snakes should be sought elsewhere...|$|R

The fragility curves for immediate occupancy, significant <b>damage,</b> and collapse <b>prevention</b> <b>damage</b> levels of the RC frame building are analyzed. The result reveals the safety levels of RC frame building in Wenchuan district before the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake...|$|R

The first concerns the reunification of set standards, ending the existing distinction between the construction site and other workplaces. The second concerns the complete abandonment of logic on which the norm in the 1950 's was based on, which are obligations and prohibitions, in favor of evaluative logic introduced in the EU Directives in the 1990 's. The paper examines in detail the path taken by Italy starting from the first legislation in the end of the 19 th century until today highlighting the following stages: - <b>Damage</b> <b>preventions</b> - Risk preventions - Safety planning - Safety management The differences found in the law summary highlight the difficulties of this route that is due to the particular situation that the construction industry is experiencing in Italy.

40|$|The Brown Treesnake (Boiga irregularis) is {{invasive}} in Guam {{and threatens}} to be dispersed by {{military and civilian}} transportation activities to other islands in the Pacific, where it {{could be expected to}} inflict similar <b>damages.</b> <b>Prevention</b> of inadvertent export of snakes in cargo and vehicles currently relies on trained canine detection teams, which are expensive to use and unable to detect all snakes. Hence, there has long been interest in developing effective and cheaper means of fumigating cargo to remove snakes. A companion study has shown that chemical fumigation is unlikely to be readily developed into a practical tool. Here, we demonstrate that these snakes are readily induced to quit test refugia by application of streams of heated air. Many parameters affect snake response times, but we find that application of relatively low temperatures (48 â 52 ËC) at moderate delivery rates (3. 4 m 3 /min) is sufficient to induce exit of these snakes within 5 min. Development of a portable heat-delivery system based on these findings has great potential to ensure snakes do not unintentionally stow away to other locations in cargo, munitions, vehicles, or airplane wheelwells. Application of such technology can be done on Guam as well as at locations receiving cargo or vehicles from that source, providing an additional layer of security in ensuring these snakes do not colonize additional locations outside their native range...|$|R
