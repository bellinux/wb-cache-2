5|$|Legends {{describing}} Cofresí as malevolent generally link him to supernatural elements {{acquired through}} witchcraft, mysticism or {{a deal with}} the Devil. This horror fiction emphasizes his ruthlessness while alive or his unwillingness to remain dead. Cofresí's ghost has a fiery aura or extraordinary powers of manifestation, defending the locations of his hidden treasure or roaming aimlessly. Cofresí has been vilified by merchants. Legends portraying him as benign figure are more prevalent near Cabo Rojo; in other areas of Puerto Rico, they focus on his treasure and depict him as a cutthroat. Most of the hidden-treasure stories <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> counseling against greed; those trying to find the plunder are killed, dragged to Davy Jones' Locker or attacked by the ghost of Cofresí or a member of his crew. Rumors about the locations of hidden treasure flourish, with dozens of coves, beaches and buildings linked to pirates in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.|$|E

5000|$|Bob Corbett replies to Singer's {{second point}} on the Kantian grounds that [...] "ought" [...] implies [...] "can": [...] "the {{practical}} necessity of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> obligation which we can keep requires us to be limited in obligation to those cases that we experience directly in the chances of living, {{and not to the}} entire world of suffering which we can know”. For Corbett, <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> obligation to people thousands of miles away “is psychologically too strong requirement for anyone to achieve”; therefore it cannot be <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> obligation.|$|R
25|$|In 1998, as Chairman of EDB, {{he decided}} to name {{publicly}} the holders of government scholarships who broke their bonds to shame them. This created a controversy generating public debates on whether those who received scholarship <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> obligation to serve, or whether the scholarship is merely a contractual agreement which could be broken {{in return for the}} stated penalties. The debate culminated when MP Chng Hee Kok (庄熙国) questioned Yeo's decision. Yeo responded by calling for Chng to resign his seat in Parliament because of his view. This led to even more unhappiness at the audacity of a civil servant talking down to an elected Member of Parliament. Then Deputy Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong had to intervene in what was seen as a face-saving rebuke for both– that Philip Yeo was wrong to tell Chng Hee Kok to resign, but Chng had also been wrong in arguing that it was acceptable for scholars to break their bonds because they were merely legal contracts.|$|E
25|$|Religion is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} belief system concerning the supernatural, sacred or divine, and practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. Some religions also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> code. The evolution {{and the history of}} the first religions have recently become areas of active scientific investigation. However, in the course of its development, religion has taken on many forms that vary by culture and individual perspective. Some of the chief questions and issues religions are concerned with include life after death (commonly involving belief in an afterlife), the origin of life, the nature of the universe (religious cosmology) and its ultimate fate (eschatology), and what is moral or immoral. A common source for answers to these questions are beliefs in transcendent divine beings such as deities or a singular God, although not all religions are theistic. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the soul or spirit, {{is one of the many}} different approaches humans take in trying to answer fundamental questions about humankind's place in the universe, the meaning of life, and the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science, spirituality is unique in that it focuses on mystical or supernatural concepts such as karma and God.|$|E
500|$|Uroš Predić (1857–1953) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} 19th- and 20th-century Serbian realists. A native of Orlovat, a village in the Banat region of Austria-Hungary, Predić drew scenes of life in the village throughout his career. One of the more frequent sights during his stays there was of intoxicated young men returning from the pub at dawn and waking up the whole village. In painting the composition, Predić was not only attempting to realistically depict contemporary village life but also to convey a message. [...] "I observed this every day", he explained. [...] "I said to myself there must be some way of telling these people to what an unhappy level they have descended and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> impact on them, capturing all the bad habits of my compatriots." [...] Predić had expressed disapproval of the villagers' behavior in an earlier work, Clients in Front of a Lawyer's Door (1886).|$|E

Fackenheim asserted that tradition could not anticipate the Holocaust, so one more law, a 614th Commandment, became necessary. [...] "Thou shalt not hand Hitler posthumous victories.

"There {{are those}} who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> {{objection}} to hunting and who are fundamentally opposed {{to the idea of}} people gaining pleasure from what they regard as the causing of unnecessary suffering. There are also those who perceive hunting as representing a divisive social class system. Others, as we note below, resent the hunt trespassing on their land, especially when they have been told they are not welcome. They worry about the welfare of the pets and animals and the difficulty of moving around the roads where they live on hunt days. Finally there {{are those who}} are concerned about damage to the countryside and other animals, particularly badgers and otters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Photojournalism works {{within the}} same ethical {{approaches}} to objectivity that are applied by other journalists. What to shoot, how to frame and how to edit are constant considerations. Photographing news for an assignment {{is one of the}} most ethical problems photographers face. Photojournalists <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> responsibility to decide what pictures to take, what picture to stage, and what pictures to show the public. For example, photographs of violence and tragedy are prevalent in American journalism because as an understated rule of thumb, that [...] "if it bleeds, it leads". The public is attracted to gruesome photographs and dramatic stories. A lot of controversy arises when deciding which photographs are too violent to show the public.|$|E
2500|$|Directly {{influenced}} by the first Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, in [...] "The Masque of the Red Death", Poe adopts many conventions of traditional Gothic fiction, including the castle setting. The multiple single-toned rooms may {{be representative of the}} human mind, showing different personality types. The imagery of blood and time throughout also indicates corporeality. The plague may, in fact, represent typical attributes of human life and mortality, which would imply the entire story is an allegory about man's futile attempts to stave off death (a commonly accepted interpretation). However, there is much dispute over how to interpret [...] "The Masque of the Red Death"; some suggest it is not allegorical, especially due to Poe's admission of a distaste for didacticism in literature. If the story really does <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral,</b> Poe does not explicitly state that moral in the text.|$|E

We provide a formal language and a consequentialist semantics. An illustration of our semantics with an analysis of the Prisoner's Dilemma follows. Next, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for (1) the possibility that a single group of agents faces <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> conflict, for (2) the possibility that two groups of agents face <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> conflict within <b>a</b> single <b>moral</b> code, and for (3) the possibility that two groups of agents face <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> conflict...|$|R

2500|$|The party {{holds that}} Denmark is not {{naturally}} {{a country of}} immigration. The party also does not accept a multi-ethnic transformation of Denmark, and rejects multiculturalism. Former party leader Pia Kjærsgaard stated she did [...] "not want Denmark as a multiethnic, multicultural society", and that a multiethnic Denmark would be a [...] "national disaster". The party seek to drastically reduce non-Western immigration, oppose islamisation, and favour cultural assimilation of immigrants. In 2010, the party proposed to put a complete stop to all immigration from non-Western countries, a continuation of a proposal the month before to toughen the 24-year rule. They do, however, make the distinction between immigrants, those who intend to stay in Denmark permanently, and refugees, those that will only be in Denmark {{for the duration of}} the conflict, but ultimately intend to return home. The party has stated that it is more than happy to help those in need, but <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> responsibility to the people of Denmark to keep Denmark Danish.|$|E
2500|$|Kaine {{personally}} opposes capital punishment, but {{presided over}} eleven executions while governor. Kaine said: [...] "I really struggled with [...] as governor.

[...] During his time in office he commuted one death sentence in June 2008, that of Percy Levar Walton to life imprisonment without parole on grounds of mental incompetence, writing that [...] "one cannot reasonably conclude that Walton is {{fully aware of the}} punishment he is about to suffer and why he is to suffer it" [...] and thus executing him would be unconstitutional. Kaine vetoed a number of bills to expand the death sentence to more crimes, saying: [...] "I do not believe that further expansion of the death penalty is necessary to protect human life or provide for public safety needs." [...] Some of the vetoes were overridden, while others were sustained.|$|E

[...] 1.1 billion people [...] 18% of humanity [...] live below the World Bank's $2/day. Is this distribution of wealth and other goods just? What is the root cause of poverty, and are there systemic injustices in the world economy? John Rawls has said that [...] international obligations are between states as long as [...] "states meet a minimal condition of decency" [...] where as Thomas Nagel argues that obligations to the others are on an individual level and that moral reasons for restraint do not need to be satisfied for an individual to deserve equal treatment internationally.
