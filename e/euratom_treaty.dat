5|$|However the ECSC {{failed to}} achieve several {{fundamental}} aims of the Treaty of Paris. It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large coal and steel {{groups such as the}} Konzerne, which helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing (another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers of the Authority, the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The <b>Euratom</b> <b>treaty</b> was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the market. These failures could be put down to overambition {{in a short period of}} time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored. It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European Coal and Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a supranational Community.|$|E

40|$|Certain minerals, {{particularly}} those containing uranium [U] and thorium [Th], emit natural ionising radiation that presents a hazard to humans. Not all are easily identified, and theproblem is compounded when radioactive elements substitute into minerals {{that are not}} normally radioactive, or form an unrecognised constituent of a specimen, whether mineral, rock or fossil The extent of radioactive holdings in a collection can only be established by measuring ionising radiation emissions for all the geological specimens using appropriate detectors. Radioactivity is subject {{to a variety of}} legislation. The Ionising Radiation Regulations (1999) detail the requirements for the protection of persons exposed as a result of work with radioactive materials. However, geological specimens fall completely out of scope of the 2010 Environment Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations and the Radioactive Sub- stances Act 1993 in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The <b>Euratom</b> Safeguards <b>Treaty</b> has placed additional responsibilities on some institutions.

Objectives To develop and evaluate clinical protocols and organisational models based on the new telemonitoring technologies in order to improve both quality of life and healthcare costs associated with elderly patients with multiple diseases. Methods Feasibility study leading to a full scale study which included: •Customisation and adaptation of the technological infrastructure in patients’ own homes. •Conducting a feasibility study on 20 patients in 3 centres of which 5 patients will be recruited from Lincolnshire. The purpose of the feasibility study is to test the systems and the protocol for the main study. •Qualitative feedback from users to inform possible enhancement of the system. Full randomised controlled trial with 300 patients, of which 32 were to be recruited from Lincolnshire. •Utility measure (EQ- 5 D 3 L) administered before and after the study. •Measures throughout the study included, service use, symptoms checklist, hospital admissions, length of stay and readmissions. Outcomes •An increased knowledge of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its interaction with other comorbidities including congestive heart failure (CHF). •An increased objective knowledge on the development of exacerbations in COPD. •A validated clinical protocol and organisational model for telemedicine in COPD with common comorbidities (CHF and sleep disorders). •An economic and clinical evaluation of the impact of electronic monitoring for elderly patients with COPD and other comorbidities. Impact The main impacts are expected to be: •clinical-medical: prevention and early detection of exacerbations for conditions such as COPD and CHF leading to improved self management and more timely medical intervention. •economical: a decrease in the need for unnecessary emergency hospitalisation leading to reduction in health care costs associated with these comorbidities. •social: prevention of chronic disease has enormous impact to society costs and wellbeing especially in elderly people...|$|R

50|$|The EU is a three-pillar {{structure}} of the original supranational European Economic Community and the nuclear non-proliferation <b>treaty,</b> <b>Euratom,</b> plus two largely intergovernmental pillars dealing with External Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs. The EU is therefore not a de jure federation, although some academic observers conclude that after 50 years of institutional evolution since the Treaties of Rome it is becoming one. The European Union possesses attributes of a federal state. However, its central government is far weaker than that of most federations and the individual members are sovereign states under international law, so it is usually characterized as an unprecedented form of supra-national union. The EU has responsibility for important areas such as trade, monetary union, agriculture, fisheries. Nonetheless, EU member states retain the right to act independently in matters of foreign policy and defense, and also enjoy a near monopoly over other major policy areas such as criminal justice and taxation. Since the Treaty of Lisbon, Member States' right to leave the Union is codified, and the Union operates with more qualified majority voting (rather than unanimity) in many areas.|$|R

50|$|The Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at Val Duchesse in 1956 drew up the {{essentials}} of the new treaties.

In contrast to the Non Proliferation Treaty, the <b>Euratom</b> <b>Treaty</b> requires to safeguard all civil nuclear material in all EU member states ¿ including the nuclear weapons states. The considerable amount of fissile material separated per year (several tonnes) calls for a stringent system of safeguards measures. The aim of safeguards is to deter diversion of nuclear material from peaceful use by maximizing the chance of early detection.

40|$|In {{the past}} the {{ownership}} of nuclear materials was considered an asset without many more considerations. Treaties such as the US Atomic Energy Act and the <b>Euratom</b> <b>Treaty</b> had the objective of ensuring regular and equitable supply of nuclear ores and fuels. In the frame of this philosophy the right of ownership {{was introduced in the}} <b>Euratom</b> <b>Treaty.</b> Throughout the years the philosophy behind the concept of such particular right of ownership has changed and the US provisions on ownership were repealed in 1964 by the Private Ownership of Special Nuclear Materials Act. However, the ownership according to the provisions of the <b>Euratom</b> <b>Treaty</b> is still unmodified in place. Nuclear accidents, the ecological concerns and the threat of nuclear terrorism have influenced the public opinion and created the overall awareness of nuclear risks. These risks relate also to back-end or spent fuel and nuclear waste, not only from a safety and security point of view, but also from an economic point of view. The present study intends to focus on the effects this evolution has had on the situation related to nuclear materials in the context of scientific research. Where in the era of enthusiasm in relation to obtaining nuclear material for research purposes without in depth consideration of future liabilities, no excessive attention was paid {{to the creation of a}} sound legal frame of supply contracts, now a growing awareness with regard to possible liabilities and economic burden gave rise to the elaboration of a series of administrative and legal obligations. This study will try to analyse the legal basis to determine ownership/right of use/liabilities and will examine the interaction between the <b>Euratom</b> <b>Treaty</b> and domestic law (both private law and nuclear (public) legislation), also in the light of the recent case law of the EJC. Past practices will be described and the problems such practices create at present will be analysed, in particular what concerns liabilities in the frame of dismantling and disposal activities and decontamination costs. Further, this contribution will try to give a transparent and practical overview on the different aspects that should be taken into consideration when negotiating contracts involving a transfer of ownership of nuclear material. For such contracts, the most relevant articles will be described in order to give a practical guidance when drafting such type of (supply) contracts. JRC. D. 1 -Management suppor...|$|E
