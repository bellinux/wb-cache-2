Extracting <b>edible</b> <b>starch</b> from the sago cycad requires special care due to the poisonous nature of cycads. Cycad sago is used {{for many of the}} same purposes as palm sago. Sago is extracted from the sago cycad by cutting the pith from the stem, root and seeds of the cycads, grinding the pith to a coarse flour and then washing it carefully and repeatedly to leach out the natural toxins. The starchy residue is then dried and cooked, producing a starch similar to palm sago/sabudana. The cycad seed contains cycasin toxin and should not be eaten as it is possible for cycasin toxin to survive the most vigorous of repeated washings. Cycasin toxin can cause ALS, Parkinson's, prostate cancer and fibrolemellar hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{conserve}} finite {{fossil fuels and}} reduce green house gas emission, the development of sustainable energy is an inevitable challenge in the 21 st century. Among the alternative energy sources, cellulosic biomass (e. g. energy grasses such as miscanthus or agricultural waste such as corn stover, bagasse, cereal straws, and wood chips) presents several unique advantages: (1) it can produce liquid fuels or chemicals that substitute the existing petroleum-derived ones without requiring significant modification of infrastructure, (2) it is renewable and potentially carbon-neutral in overall life cycle, and (3) it is inexpensive, ubiquitous and faces less land use competition with food compared to <b>edible</b> biomass (sugar, <b>starch</b> and oil). Aiming {{to contribute to the}} development of biomass conversion technology, my Ph. D. study was conducted at the Energy Biosciences Institute, a multidisciplinary joint initiative for biomass research between UC Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and BP. Specifically, my focus has been the downstream conversion of sugar/sugar derivatives into chemicals, as described below. Chapter 1 : Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a plastic in large demand worldwide, due to its utility in the manufacturing of a range of products from beverage containers to synthetic fibers. The key monomer of PET, terephthalic acid, is currently produced by oxidizing p- xylene from crude oil. In an effort to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel, we demonstrated a route to synthesize solely biomass-derived p- xylene as a drop-in replacement. Namely, we explored the feasibility of converting 2, 5 -dimethylfuran (derived from 5 -(hydroxymethyl) furfural, a typical by-product of cellulose hydrolysis) and acrolein (produced from glycerol, a side-product of fatty acid methyl ester biodiesel production) into p- xylene. This synthesis consisted of a sequential Diels-Alder reaction, oxidation, dehydration, and decarboxylation. In particular, the pivotal first step, the Diels-Alder reaction to construct 7 -oxabicyclo[2, 2, 1]hept- 2 -ene core structure, was studied in detail to provide useful kinetic and thermodynamic data. The concept was realized and the bio-derived p- xylene was obtained in 34 % overall yield over four steps. Chapter 2 : The deoxygenation reaction of sugar moieties is essential for the conversion of cellulosic biomass to chemicals and fuels. While numerous reports focus on the pyrolysis, hydrogenolysis and acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction of biomass, one much less developed deoxygenation pathway is the deoxydehydration (DODH) reaction, which removes two adjacent hydroxyl groups from vicinal diols to afford alkenes. We have developed an oxorhenium-catalyzed DODH reaction using a sacrificial alcohol (e. g. 1 -butanol, 3 -pentanol) as a recyclable and environmentally friendly solvent/reductant, and successfully applied it to sugars, sugar acids and sugar alcohols. When combined with the alcohol reductant, oxorhenium compounds, namely methyltrioxorhenium (MTO) and perrhenic acid (HReO 4), showed much higher activity than other precedented DODH systems and enabled the unstable polyol substrates to undergo clean DODH reactions. Linear polyene products and aromatic compounds were obtained with remarkable selectivity. Mechanistic insights were acquired by studying the isolated Re(V) species as well as by examining the unprecedented modes of DODH on 2 -ene- 1, 4 -diol and 2, 4 -diene- 1, 6 -diol moieties...|$|R

Taccaceae contains only two genera, Schizocapsa and Tacca. The former consists of only two species located in the South China-Malaya area, while Tacca, which is sub-divided into three sections Ataccia, Palmotacca, and Eutacca - is more widely distributed (3). Limpricht (4) accepted the name Tacca pinnatifida J. & G. Forst. for pia, but the presently accepted name is Tacca Leontopetaloides (L.) O. Ktze (5) * Pia is probably native to tropical Asia and of aboriginal introduction to Hawaii (6), although the exact origin of this species is not known (7). Pia is an herb consisting of tuberous underground stems similar to the potato, with leaves that rise directly {{from the ground and}} which resemble papaya leaves. 'The stem, which may reach a height of four feet or more, is topped by a striking inflorescence of small green and purplish flowers (8) (see Fig. 1). The pia plant was cultivated for its starch content and was produced in Hawaii in sizable quantities in the 1850 's for export to Europe under the name "arrowroot" (9). The plant is rarely cultivated now, but small quantities can still be found growing wild near Hilo in the Puna district. The pure starch from the pia tubers was combined with coconut cream, bananas or ti root juice to yield food staples eaten by most Polynesians. It was well known to the Hawaiians, however, that a bitter material had to be removed from the raw tuber {{in order to make the}} <b>starch</b> <b>edible.</b> The raw tuber has been reported to be toxic (10) and only the Easter Islanders are reputed to eat the unwashed tuber, but only after baking (11). The Hawaiians grated the tubers and washed them in running water for prolonged periods. The resultant bitter extract was used in this dilute state as a medicine to combat diarrhea and dysentery, particularly in infants (12). In 1857, Lepine carried out a superficial chemical analysis of pia and reported 2. 2 % of a bitter extract (13). This report is the sole published record of a chemical nature concerning pia. Except for a similar paper dealing with the bitterness and toxicity of Tacca umbrarum* (14), no chemical study has been made of any species of this plant family. Since no chemical compounds have been isolated from Taccaceae, a prediction of the general nature of the bitter principle cannot be made. It was hoped that a search of the literature for bitter principles from other plants might indicate some relationship from which the bitter principle of pia could be categorized as to type. Some representative bitter principles of current interest, some of which are still incompletely characterized, are listed in Table I. Only those containing carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are recorded, since they are more pertinent to this investigation, as will be seen later. It is apparent from Table I that non-nitrogenous bitter principles occur in widely diverse plant types - flowering plants and even lichens. Chemically, several skeletal types can be distinguished: steroid, terpenoid, aromatic and depsidone, any of which may be glycosidically bound to a sugar moiety. Although most of the compounds are highly oxygenated, the nature of the oxygen functions vary widely and any relationship which might exist is not immediately apparent. Due to this great diversity of chemical types found in plants, little ~ priori information can be surmised about the bitter principle of pia. It is interesting to note that many of these bitter principles possess pharmacological activity of great diversity. Because of the very small amount of the bitter principle that was obtained by extraction of the tubers, only a limited quantity was available for structural studies. Although micro methods were used, checking of results and duplicate runs frequently were impossible. The object of this investigation was to isolate, purify and characterize the bitter principle found in pia...|$|R
