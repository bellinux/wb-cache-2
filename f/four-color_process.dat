25|$|Newspapers {{are usually}} printed on cheap, off-white paper known as newsprint. Since the 1980s, the {{newspaper}} industry has largely {{moved away from}} lower-quality letterpress printing to higher-quality, <b>four-color</b> <b>process,</b> offset printing. In addition, desktop computers, word processing software, graphics software, digital cameras and digital prepress and typesetting technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative layouts and better design. To help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the Financial Times is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and Sheffield's weekly sports publication derives its name, the Green 'Un, from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport is also printed on pink paper while L'Équipe (formerly L'Auto) is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the Giro d'Italia wears a pink jersey.|$|E

The colors were red, yellow, green, and blue, with overlapping wavelengths to prevent pulsating effects on the screen with vivid colors. The film was photographed at 26 to 32 frames per second, and projected at 32 frame/s. The disk used in projection consisted mainly of two colors, red-orange and blue-green, adapted to the <b>four-color</b> <b>process</b> by the superimposition of two small magenta filters {{over one of the}} red sectors and two similar blue filters over one of the blue-green sectors.

Created between 2013-14, his identically sized, 2.5-meter tall canvases of powdery silkscreened bricks are lined and separated with fragments of pages from the Italian architecture and design magazine Domus. In each one of the paintings, Walker begins by scanning individual bricks, which he then arranges into a stacked alignment and silkscreens using a <b>four-color</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
50|$|CMYK {{or process}} color {{printing}} is contrasted with spot color printing, in which specific colored inks {{are used to}} generate the colors appearing on paper. Some printing presses are capable of printing with both <b>four-color</b> <b>process</b> inks and additional spot color inks at the same time. High-quality printed materials, such as marketing brochures and books, often include photographs requiring process-color printing, other graphic effects requiring spot colors (such as metallic inks), and finishes such as varnish, which enhances the glossy appearance of the printed piece.|$|E
50|$|Full color cards, or {{cards that}} use many colors, are printed on sheetfed presses as well; however, {{they use the}} CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) <b>four-color</b> {{printing}} <b>process.</b> Screens of each color overprinted on one another create a wide gamut of color. The downside to this printing method is that screened colors if examined closely will reveal tiny dots, whereas spot color cards are printed solid in most cases. Spot colors {{should be used for}} simple cards with line art or non-black type that is smaller than 5 points.|$|R
50|$|After {{his father}} died, Friedländer {{inherited}} his old lithographic press {{and set up}} shop in the St. Pauli quarter of Hamburg. He initially concentrated on label printing for kolonialwaren and delikatesswaren (types of gourmet grocers). Friedländer's shop was located nearby to the , an area of numerous beer halls, vaudeville theaters, music halls and other exhibition spaces. Deciding these presented a better business opportunity, he abandoned label printing and focused instead on selling posters to these businesses utilizing the complex <b>four-color</b> lithographic <b>process</b> he had learned in France. Friedländer breakthrough moment came when he received large orders of posters advertising Carl Hagenbeck's animal shows in 1883 and 1884.|$|R
50|$|Mannes and Godowsky {{first took}} an {{interest}} in color photography when in 1917, still high school pupils at the time, they saw a movie called Our Navy, a movie made using a <b>four-color</b> additive <b>process.</b> Both agreed the color was terrible. After reading up on the subject in the library they started to experiment with additive color processes. Their experiments were continued during their college years, eventually producing a camera having two lenses that project images side by side on a single strip of film. The color rendition of this additive two-color process was not too bad, but aligning the two lenses of the projector needed was too difficult.|$|R
50|$|Massimo Osti {{was born}} and raised in Bologna, Italy. He became a graphic {{designer}} and worked in the advertising business. His career in the fashion industry began in the early 1970s, when he designed a T-shirt collection featuring placed prints. He was the first to use new techniques like the <b>four-color</b> <b>process</b> and silkscreen which are used for producing T-shirt. Following the success of this first T-shirt collection, he accepted the offer to design a complete Men's collection and became an equity partner in the company he would name 'Chester Perry' (later renamed the 'C.P.

50|$|A general {{theatrical}} release through Emerson Film Enterprises {{was launched}} with an official opening in Los Angeles on 3 July 1962. An advertising campaign was begun, including the broadcast of short TV spots. Unlike most film posters of the time, which were printed by a <b>four-color</b> <b>process</b> that allowed {{a full range}} of eye-catching colors to be used, the posters for this film were two-color printings limited to black, white, red, grays, pinks and browns. The use of a two-color poster for a small independent black-and-white film was not uncommon, but it was unusual when one of the selling points of the film being advertised was {{the fact that it was}} in color.|$|E
50|$|The {{practice}} of Pointillism is {{in sharp contrast}} to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a palette. Pointillism is analogous to the <b>four-color</b> CMYK printing <b>process</b> used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of Cyan (blue), Magenta (red), Yellow, and Key (black). Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) colors.|$|R

50|$|Artists {{generally}} use {{inkjet printing}} to make reproductions {{of their original}} two-dimensional artwork, photographs, or computer-generated art. Professionally produced inkjet prints are much more expensive on a per-print basis than the <b>four-color</b> offset lithography <b>process</b> traditionally used for such reproductions. (A large-format inkjet print can cost more than $50, not including scanning and color correction, compared to $5 for a four-color offset litho print of the same image in a run of 1,000.) Four-color offset lithographic presses have the disadvantage of the full job having {{to be set up}} and produced all at once in a mass edition. With inkjet printing the artist does not {{have to pay for the}} expensive printing plate setup or the marketing and storage needed for large four-color offset print runs. This allows the artist to follow a just-in-time business model in which inkjet printing can be an economical option, since art can be printed and sold individually in accordance with demand. Inkjet printing has the added advantage of allowing artists to take total control of the production of their images, including the final color correction and the substrates being used, and it is even feasible for individual artists to own and operate their own printers.|$|R

50|$|In printing, anilox is {{a method}} used to provide a {{measured}} amount of ink to a flexo printing plate An anilox roll is a hard cylinder, usually constructed of a steel or aluminum core which is coated by an industrial ceramic whose surface contains millions of very fine dimples, known as cells. ==Usage== Depending on the detail of the images to be printed, the press operator will select an anilox roll with a higher or lower line screen. Low line screen rolls are used where a heavy layer of ink is desired, such as in heavy block lettering. Higher line screens produce finer details and are used in <b>four-color</b> <b>process</b> work such as reproducing photographs. Often a job will require a different line screen for each color to be printed. Experienced press operators are skilled at determining the appropriate rolls for a given print job.Depending {{on the design of}} the printing press, the anilox roll is either semi-submerged in the ink fountain, or comes into contact with a so-called metering roller, which is semi-submerged in the ink fountain. In either instance, a thick layer of typically viscous ink is deposited on the roll. A doctor blade is used to scrape excess ink from the surface leaving just the measured amount of ink in the cells. The roll then rotates to contact with the flexographic printing plate which receives the ink from the cells for transfer to the printed material.|$|E
5000|$|George Drury Smith started {{publishing}} the magazine Beyond Baroque in 1968 from a storefront in Venice, which {{soon became a}} meeting place with workshops and space for readings, art, and music. Although 10,000 copies of the first issue were printed offset, subsequent issues were printed in-house using a <b>four-color</b> <b>process.</b> Later the magazines were printed on bound newsprint and distributed free. The workshops, over the years, have generated numerous writers, presses, {{and some of the}} leading poets in Los Angeles. The facilitators have included founders Joseph Hansen and John Harris, Leland Hickman, Bob Flanagan, John Thomas, Will Alexander, Jeff McDaniel, Philomene Long, Simone Forti, Sarah Maclay, liz gonzalez, and others. The Center’s first librarian was Exene Cervenka of the [...] "X", which was formed when Exene and John Doe met at the Wednesday Night Poetry Workshop. Some of the LA artist Mike Kelley’s first performances were at the Center, and the cover of one of the Center’s early issues of Beyond Baroque, featuring an array of experimental filmmakers, was displayed in the Pompidou’s 2006 show on LA art.

40|$|The {{application}} of the <b>four-color</b> <b>process</b> to printing fine line work found on topographical maps was investigated. A description of the mapping process is included {{and the reason why}} the <b>four-color</b> <b>process</b> would be advantageous to cartographic printing was discussed. The chapter on fourcolor process theory was included {{for the benefit of the}} cartographic community - The experimental design for data transfer, color tolerance, target design to match spot and process color, as well as color space employed, were reviewed. The reasons for the use of a direct digital proofing system were explained. The results of data transfer were evaluated and solutions obtained for limitations in the transfer mechanisms. Color tolerances were established using the CIE LAB color space and two image maps. Using colorimetry, test targets matching the spot color to its equivalent process color were evaluated and found to fall within the established tolerances. Three topographical maps were produced totally in the digital domain. The Cartographic Community carefully evaluated these products and deemed them as the preferred method for generating topographic maps. The results of this study can be interpreted to show that the <b>four-color</b> <b>process</b> system is the most advantageous method for the generation of cartographic products...|$|E

40|$|Screen {{printing}}, {{unlike other}} printing processes, requires ink {{to be pushed}} through the image carrier to the substrate. When the mesh threads and their intersections cross the image area, they act as obstructions to the ink flow. In large image areas, the effect of mesh interference is minimal. In fine detail screen printing, mesh interference is a primary cause of poor or inaccurate resolution. The trend in screen printing has been toward more and finer fine line, halftone and <b>four-color</b> <b>process</b> printing. Researching methods to minimize mesh interference will enable screen printers to gain greater control over the printing process and better utilize technologies currently available for fine detail reproduction. Previous experiments had shown that the angle of a fine line image relative to the mesh threads will {{have an effect on}} resolution quality. This thesis developed a theoretical model for hypothesizing that image angle may also affect resolution in halftone screen printing. A fine line test image was developed to attempt to reproduce the results of experiments indicating a critical angle exists for fine lines, and to determine if the direction of the squeegee motion is also a factor. Halftone gray scales screened at all of the common four-color and black and white reproduction angles, {{as well as at the}} aforementioned hypothesized fine line critical angle, were used to determine if image angle has an effect on reproduceable tonal range and on the accuracy of resolution in halftone screen printing. Exposure and squeegee conditions were optimized, and the test images were printed. Data on fine line and halftone resolution was collected and statistically analyzed to determine if image angle had an effect on the resolution. In all cases, angle was found to have an effect on image resolution. However, no one angle or small range of angles was found to provide significantly better resolution than another. In the fine line test, it appeared that a relationship does exist between image resolution and the direction of squeegee motion. This was not evident in the halftone resolution data. The halftone data, however, does indicate a relationship exists between loss of percent dot area and tonal range. Further investigation of these factors in screen printing is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Looking at {{the shoes}} that digital {{photography}} {{has a role}} in filling we can quickly see performance issues that will undoubtedly affect our final printed reproduction. The resolution provided by a digital image is directly correlated to the CCD size, quality and any associated post-imaging processes provided by cam era manufacturers but {{is only one of}} quality-limiting factors involved in digital photography. 2 ̆ 2 Silicon-based CCD 2 ̆ 7 s are monochrome in nature. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 Having the inability to decipher the varying degrees of red, green and blue light presented to the pixels it is necessary to account for RGB light by introducing a color-filtering method. The color-filtering method prevalent in the cameras to be tested are referred to as 2 ̆ 2 integral color filter arrays (CFA). 2 ̆ 22 Integral color filter arrays performs color filtering on the chip with each individual pixel hosting a specific filter color (red, green or blue). This allows for the deciphering of the various light wavelengths presented in a scene to be translated by the CCD into digitized values of color, but because each pixel can only represent one filter color this results in problems including; 2 ̆ 2 the loss of information leading to reduced effective resolution and increased sampling (quantizing) artifacts. 2 ̆ 23 Such color-gathering techniques and various inherent CCD issues account for problems that must be addressed and minimized during post-image processing prepress steps. The following endeavor is to evaluate three types of digital cameras (Minolta RD- 175, Fuji 505 a, AP NC 2000 e/Canon DCS EOS 3) which can meet the requirements of a photojournalist then identifying the various issues that are inherent to each camera, post processing prepress solutions will be sought through the use of Adobe Photoshop. By evaluating the cameras via tests that provide information about resolution, dynamic range, color gamut reproduction abilities and image-to-noise relationships it was possible to assess what cam era shortcomings must be addressed during post-image processing. The shortcomings were then individually assessed and, utilizing prepress skills post-processing procedures, were identified to address the specific inherent shortcomings. Using SNAP (specifications for non-heat advertising printing) specifications, a representative set of images were printed and analyzed. The results from this analysis presents camera performance issues prior to post-image processing optimization and after post-image processing optimization. It will illustrate the initial shortcomings and how well these shortcomings can be de-emphasized in Adobe Photoshop. The printing of test images to SNAP specifications also illustrates if there is any loss of quali ty due to the reproduction on newsprint. Based on the test performed it was established that each usable camera ISO has its own specific set of characteristics that effect visual resolution, color gamut, usable range and noise. The method the man ufacturer uses to acquire its images, including CCD hardware, camera firmware and pre-acquire pro cessing, also affect visual resolution, color gamut, usable range, noise and aliasing. Photographic metering techniques and photographer criteria for ISO selection can assist in main taining the highest level of exposure quality capable for each camera. When the highest level of image quality is achieved with the use of photographic techniques, the highest level of visual resolution, color gamut, usable range and the least noise can be rendered for each camera image. Knowledge of Adobe Photoshop and offset printing principles, such as memory colors, wanted and unwanted colors, are valuable in enhancing the digital camera 2 ̆ 7 s limited color gamut. The nature of the newspaper printing process produces a small color gamut, therefore, the limited gamut inherent in the digital cameras is of less concern than if the digital images were printed using a larger color gamut capa ble <b>four-color</b> <b>process.</b> The identification of each camera 2 ̆ 7 s tendencies does allow for a greater understanding of applic able procedures within Adobe Photoshop which can reduce and or alleviate the tendencies...|$|E
