5|$|Over 40% of French {{grape vines}} and {{vineyards}} were devastated over a 15-year period, {{from the late}} 1850s to the mid-1870s. The French economy was badly hit by the blight; many businesses were lost, and wages in the wine industry were cut to less than half. There was also a noticeable trend of migration to, among other places, Algiers and America. The production of cheap raisins and sugar wines caused problems for the <b>domestic</b> <b>industry</b> that threatened to persist even after the blight itself. The damage to the French economy, is estimated to have been slightly over 10billion Francs.|$|E

5|$|The war {{had ended}} before series {{production}} was started, and the Defence Forces {{did not need}} new vehicles. On the contrary, the army had {{to reduce the number}} of vehicles according to the Moscow Armistice. The frustrated component suppliers left the business and the Ministry of Trade and Industry terminated the vehicle supply contract from the end of 1946. In early 1946, Yhteissisu had agreed with the Ministry of Trade and Industry that vehicles not bought by the state could be sold on the civilian market. Sisu S-22s became available for sale at 12 SAT locations in Finland. The company presented a lighter, lower-cost model, the S-22K, at the Helsinki <b>Domestic</b> <b>Industry</b> Fair in May 1946.|$|E
5|$|Currency war, {{also known}} as {{competitive}} devaluations, is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall {{in relation to other}} currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more expensive. Both effects benefit the <b>domestic</b> <b>industry,</b> and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as well as in the cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming all countries.|$|E
5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies {{had been made by}} the American-educated Chinese-Indonesian director The Teng Chun. His low budget but popular films were mainly inspired by Chinese mythology or martial arts, and although aimed at ethnic Chinese proved popular among native audiences because of their action sequences. The Teng Chun's dominance was an effect of the Great Depression and changing market trends. The Great Depression had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices, ensuring that there was a very low profit margin for local films. As a result, cinemas in the colony mainly showed Hollywood productions, while the <b>domestic</b> <b>industry</b> decayed. The Teng Chun was able to continue his work only because his films often played to full theatres.|$|E
50|$|Governments in some {{countries}} that have recently started to become industrialized try to increase tariffs on importing goods {{in order for the}} <b>domestic</b> <b>industries</b> to survive in rivalry with foreign industries; however, Afghanistan, due to getting WTO membership, {{would not be able to}} increase tariffs on importing goods. Thus, newly emerged <b>domestic</b> <b>industries</b> could suffer in competition with foreign industries and could be defeated by imported goods. Some believe that this may lead to increased unemployment in the country.|$|R

25|$|A high tariff to {{encourage}} the development of <b>domestic</b> <b>industry</b> had been advocated for many years, especially by the Whig Party and its long-time leader Henry Clay. They enacted such a tariff in 1842, but in 1846 the Democrats enacted the Walker Tariff, cutting tariff rates substantially. The Democrats cut rates even further in the Tariff of 1857, which was highly favorable to the South.|$|E

The study finds that active opposition by <b>domestic</b> <b>industries</b> substantially reduces the probability that eligibility is granted.

25|$|The {{primary action}} of buffer stocks, {{creating}} price stability, is often {{combined with other}} mechanisms to meet other goals such as the promotion of <b>domestic</b> <b>industry.</b> That is achieved by setting a minimum price for a certain product above the equilibrium price, {{the point at which}} the supply and demand curves cross, which guarantees a minimum price to producers, encouraging them to produce more and thus creating a surplus ready to be used as a buffer stock. The price stability itself may also tempt firms into the market, further boosting supply.|$|E
25|$|Economists {{state that}} the Venezuelan {{government}} began rationing in 2014 due to multiple issues, including an unproductive <b>domestic</b> <b>industry</b> that has been negatively affected by nationalizations and government intervention, and confusing currency controls that made it unable to provide the dollars importers need {{to pay for the}} majority of basic products that enter Venezuela. According to Venezuelan residents, the government also rations public water to those who use water over 108 hours a week due to the nation's poor water delivery systems. Gasoline is also rationed in Venezuela allegedly due to smuggling of the subsidized Venezuelan gasoline to Colombia where it is sold for a higher price.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the brewing {{industry}} in northern Europe {{changed from a}} small-scale <b>domestic</b> <b>industry</b> to a large-scale export industry. The key innovation was the introduction of hops, which began in northern Germany in the 13th century. Hops sharply improved both the brewing process {{and the quality of}} beer. Other innovations from German lands involved larger kettle sizes and more frequent brewing. Consumption went up, while brewing became more concentrated because it was a capital-intensive industry. Thus in Hamburg per capita consumption increased from an average of 300 liters per year in the 15th century to about 700 in the 17th century.|$|E

Initial sales were much lower than expected, while most output was purchased for public fleets. New incentives were issued in 2014, with a sales target of 160,000 units for 2014. This goal was also not achieved.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, younger Hong Kong workers began {{avoiding}} the manufacturing industry entirely. Hong Kong's on-going evolution away from manufacturing picked up steam during the decade, as production's {{share of the}} economy fell from 22.8% in 1980 to 16.7% ten years later. Replacing it was a greater reliance on services, which rose from 68.3% to 75.4% of GDP. The fastest growing sectors were foreign trade, logistics and communications and general personal and community services. The lack of investment in <b>domestic</b> <b>industry,</b> along with China's economic reform, began opening up manufacturing to the mainland.
