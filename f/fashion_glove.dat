40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to identify the quatity of bating agent used in tanning rabbit skins to be glove leather, to make use rabbit skins which can not be tanned to fur rabbit skin leather. The materials used in this research were of 40 pieces of lokal salt preservated rabbit skins originated from Yogyakarta having quality III and IV. They were grouped into four and the groups consisted of ten pieces each were tanned to be <b>fashion</b> <b>glove</b> leather using 4 % formaline as pretanning agent and followed by chrome tanning agent as the retanning agent. Before carrying out both tanning processes bating was done on them using Pancreol Bate as bating agent. The quantity of bating agent added was varried as 0, 65 %, 1, 2 %, 1, 8 % and 2, 4 %. The process used was of usually carried - out by IRDLAI. The leather produced were tested on their sotfness, with sheepskin glove leather was used as the measuring- rod; their tensile strength resistance and flexibility with SII. 0061 – 74 (Quality and test method for goatsheep skin glove and garment leather) as the standard of comparison. The test results were statistically evaluated. A conclusion can be down from this research that by using 0, 6 % Pancreol Bate on bating process, soft glove leathers having good tensile strength and flexibility which fulfill the requirements of SII. 0061 - 74 can be produced...|$|E

[...] The business peaked in the 1950s, when she was known as [...] "the Queen's favourite glovemaker" [...] and had between 250 and 500 workers in her factory in a former dairy in Brighton; but the popularity of wearing <b>fashion</b> <b>gloves</b> declined. [...] Her products were still popular with royalty, though, and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, the Princess Royal and Diana, Princess of Wales all wore her gloves—as did members of the Belgian, Dutch and Swedish royal families. [...] The firm of Cornelia James finally became Royal Warrant holders in 1979, {{and they are the}} Queen's official glovemaker.|$|R
60|$|The man he knew {{by sight}} and {{reputation}} as a very brilliant young lawyer, Edward Benson, of Heron Lake. The girl he knew instantly to be utterly alien to this land and people. She was like a tropic bird seen amid the scant foliage of northern hills. There was evidence of great care and taste in every fold of her modish dress. Her hat was simple but in the latest city <b>fashion,</b> and her <b>gloves</b> were spotless. She gave off an odor of cleanliness and beauty.|$|R
2500|$|Humans are the {{greatest}} threat to dik-dik, which are sometimes hunted for their hides and bones, often using snares. The bones from their legs and feet are used in traditional jewelry, while their hides are <b>fashioned</b> into suede <b>gloves.</b> Parker (1990) noted that an entire dik-dik hide is required to produce a single glove. Nowak (1991) asserted that dik-dik are disliked by local hunters because they flush and warn larger game to the presence of humans. Kingdon (1982) revealed that dik-dik also benefit from the destruction of vegetation via human-mediated slash and burn agriculture that results in the subsequent secondary growth of shrubs that serve as a food source and place of refuge for dik-dik. The IUCN Redlist lists the Kirk's dik-dik as [...] "least concern".|$|R
50|$|At about 1899 {{a letter}} was {{published}} in The Times about the cruelty of West Australian settlers to Aborigines. As Bates was preparing to return to Australia, she wrote to The Times offering to make full investigations and report the results to them. Her offer was accepted and she sailed back to Australia in August 1899. In all, Bates devoted 40 {{years of her life}} to studying Aboriginal life, history, culture, rites, beliefs and customs. She researched and wrote on the subject while living in a tent in small settlements from Western Australia to the edges of the Nullarbor Plain, including at Ooldea in South Australia. She was also famed for her strict lifelong adherence to Edwardian <b>fashion,</b> including boots, <b>gloves</b> and a veil.|$|R

2500|$|It was {{not until}} the 16th century that gloves reached their {{greatest}} elaboration; however, when Queen ElizabethI set the fashion for wearing them richly embroidered and jewelled, and for putting them on and taking them off during audiences, to draw attention to her beautiful hands. The 1592 [...] "Ditchley" [...] portrait of her features her holding leather gloves in her left hand. In Paris, the gantiers became gantiers parfumeurs, for the scented oils, musk, ambergris and civet, that perfumed leather gloves, but their trade, which was an introduction at the court of Catherine de Medici, was not specifically recognised until 1656, in a royal brevet. Makers of knitted gloves, which did not retain perfume and had less social cachet, were organised in a separate guild, of bonnetiers who might knit silk as well as wool. Such workers were already organised in the fourteenth century. Knitted gloves were a refined handiwork that required five years of apprenticeship; defective work was subject to confiscation and burning. In the 17th century, gloves made of soft chicken skin became fashionable. The craze for gloves called [...] "limericks" [...] took hold. This particular fad was the product of a manufacturer in Limerick, Ireland, who <b>fashioned</b> the <b>gloves</b> from the skin of unborn calves.|$|R

In fact, there is an engraving of England's Queen Mary dating from the 1690s in which she is shown wearing elbow-length gloves. Over-the-elbow gloves were first widely popular during the Regency/Napoleonic period (circa 18001825), and waned in popularity during the early and mid-Victorian periods (circa 18301870), but enjoyed their greatest vogue {{in the last two decades}} of the 19th century and the years of the 20th century prior to the start of World War I. During that period, they were standard for both daytime and evening wear with most types of outfitseven some swimming outfits of the period were accessorized with opera gloves. Etiquette of that period considered gloves to be mandatory accessories for both men and women of the upper classes, so it was fairly uncommon during that era to see a well-dressed woman at a public occasion who was not wearing gloves of some sort. According to several <b>fashion</b> historians, over-the-elbow <b>gloves</b> were popularized, or more accurately re-popularized, during the late 19th century by the renowned actresses Sarah Bernhardt in France (who liked wearing long gloves to disguise what she considered her overly thin arms) and Lillian Russell in the United States.|$|R
