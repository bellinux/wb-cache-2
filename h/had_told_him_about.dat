Initially the police suspect that Jake was behind this but later release him. Loretta once more begins to doubt him. Upset, Jake goes to stay with his old friend Caroline (Amber Hodgkiss). After sleeping with him Caroline drugs him, ties him up, tries to kill him, and holds him hostage for a few days. She is angered to learn he is going out with Loretta and sets out to try to kill Holly but Loretta is there by Holly's bedside. Caroline tries to attack Loretta with a syringe needle but Jake saves Loretta and, in the process, Caroline is stabbed with the needle. After the ordeal Loretta disappears, having {{to accept the fact that}} Jake had cheated on her much to his dismay. She returns but while she was away Loretta had become involved with a realtor called Adam. At first Jake thought she was looking for a home. However, when he saw them both arguing, Jake realises something was not as it seemed. When Jake confronts Loretta she tells him that Adam was harassing her. This leads to Jake confronting Adam and warning him to stay away from Loretta. However Adam tells him that Loretta had been controlling his life and that she wants to be with him. Adam explains that Loretta <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Jake and that he was the biggest mistake of her life in the hope that Adam would take her back.|$|E
25|$|Hazard took Jung's advice {{seriously and}} set about seeking a {{personal}} spiritual experience. He returned home to the United States and joined a First-Century Christian evangelical movement known as the Oxford Group (later known as Moral Re-Armament). He also told other alcoholics what Jung <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> {{the importance of a}} spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was Ebby Thacher, a long-time friend and drinking buddy of Bill Wilson, later co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group, and through them Wilson became aware of Hazard's experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly found its way into the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original twelve-step program.|$|E
25|$|Several {{officials}} {{associated with}} the case, including those from Home Ministry and Intelligence Bureau, later accused the then UPA government of changing an affidavit for political gains. Following latest developments, Supreme Court has decided to hear plea for quashing action against Gujarat police. Those killed in the incident were Ishrat Jahan Raza, a 19-year-old woman from Mumbra, Maharashtra, and three men – Javed Ghulam Sheikh (born Pranesh Pillai), Amjad Ali Rana and Zeeshan Johar. The police claimed that Ishrat Jahan and her associates were Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operatives involved in a terroristic plot to assassinate the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi. Though refuted by several human right activists and questioned by CBI, these claims have gained credence after revelations by several officials associated with this case. David Headley, a Pakistani-American terrorist who had collaborated with the LeT, later said that Ishrat Jahan was an operative of the LeT.. But when he was deposing via video conferencing from the U.S. before Judge G.A. Sanap in the 26/11 trial against Abu Jundal, David Coleman Headley told the court that he didn't have any first hand knowledge about Ishrat Jahan {{who was killed in}} a police encounter.Later, David Coleman Headley claimed that LeT commander Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Ishrat Jahan ‘operation’ though he had also learnt about the case through the media.|$|E

500|$|Yemen's Deputy Prime Minister for Defense and Security Affairs, Rashad Mohammed al-Alimi, said Yemeni {{investigators}} believe the suspect traveled in October to Shabwa, where {{he may have}} obtained the explosives and received training. He met with suspected al-Qaida members in a house built by al-Awlaki and used by al-Awlaki to hold religious meetings. [...] "If he went to Shabwa, for sure he would have met Anwar al-Awlaki," [...] al-Alimi said. Al-Alimi also said he believed al-Awlaki was alive. [...] And Abdul Elah al-Shaya, a Yemeni journalist, said a healthy al-Awlaki called him on December 28 {{and said that the}} Yemeni government's claims as to his death were [...] "lies". Shaya declined to comment as to whether al-Awlaki <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> any contacts he may have had with Abdulmutallab.

500|$|Shortly after {{completing}} Wonder Boys, Chabon discovered {{a box of}} comic books from his childhood; a reawakened interest in comics, coupled with memories of the [...] "lore" [...] his Brooklyn-born father <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> [...] "the middle years {{of the twentieth century}} in America. ...the radio shows, politicians, movies, music, and athletes, and so forth, of that era," [...] inspired him to begin work on a new novel. In 2000, he published The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, an epic historical novel that charts 16 years in the lives of Sammy Clay and Joe Kavalier, two Jewish cousins who create a wildly popular series of comic books in the early 1940s, the years leading up to the entry of the U.S. into World War II. The novel received [...] "nearly unanimous praise" [...] and became a New York Times Best Seller, eventually winning the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Chabon reflected that, in writing Kavalier & Clay, [...] "I discovered strengths I had hoped that I possessed—the ability to pull off multiple points of view, historical settings, the passage of years—but which had never been tested before." ...|$|E
500|$|Around this time, a {{group of}} Austral Africa Company prospectors, led by Alfred Haggard, {{approached}} Lobengula's south-western border, hoping to gain their own Matabeleland mining concession; on learning of this, the king honoured one {{of the terms of}} the Rudd Concession by allowing Maguire to go {{at the head of a}} Matabele impi to turn Haggard away. While Robinson's letter to Knutsford made its way to England by sea, the Colonial Secretary learned of the Rudd Concession from Cawston and Gifford. Knutsford wired Robinson on 17 December to ask if there was any truth in what the London syndicate <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the agreed transfer of 1,000 Martini–Henrys: [...] "If rifles part of consideration, as reported, do you think there will be danger of complications arising from this?" [...] Robinson replied, again in writing; he enclosed a minute from Shippard in which the Bechuanaland official explained how the concession had come about, and expressed the view that the Matabele were less experienced with rifles than with assegais, so their receipt of such weapons did not in itself make them lethally dangerous. He then argued that it would not be diplomatic to give Khama and other chiefs firearms while withholding them from Lobengula, and that a suitably armed Matabeleland might act as a deterrent against Boer interference.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, some {{media outlets}} {{reported}} that the convicted terrorist David Headley had implicated Ishrat in terrorist activities in a statement given to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). However, the NIA called these reports [...] "baseless", and the CBI said that this assertion was fabricated by the IPS officer Rajendra Kumar, {{who is one of}} the suspects in the case. In June 2013, the Intelligence Bureau chief Asif Ibrahim told the Office of the Prime Minister and the Home Minister of India that the Bureau had enough evidence to prove that Ishrat was a part of an LeT module which planned to kill Narendra Modi and the former Deputy Prime Minister of India, Lal Krishna Advani. In February 2016, Headley testified before a Mumbai court, via video from the US, that Ishrat Jahan was a member of Lashkar-e-Taiba. Later in March 2016, he claimed that he had told NIA that about Jahan.
