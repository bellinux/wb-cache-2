The evaluation was twofold: 1) to identifying bottlenecks and possible <b>de-bottleneck</b> solutions and 2) to analyse flexibility effects on overall plant performance. Results indicate that flexibility is technically possible. Overall plant performance shows a minor drop in efficiency when switching from coal to Eucalyptus. When using torrefied biomass this drop almost completely disappears...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{complexities}} of the process plant are increasingly becoming hard to <b>de-bottleneck</b> {{as a result of}} continuous new development in technology. This has resulted in a need to check design for errors and omissions, a task which has traditionally been carried out on individual basis. A typical process plant is generally associated with three major hazards namely, toxic hazard, fire hazard and explosive hazard. The hazard question is a complicated one as it involves the degree of hazard, precautionary steps taken to prevent the initiation of the hazard and adequacy of the protection of personnel as well as facilities. The Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) on a generalized process plant serves to identify the safety problems associated with the plant and also helps to improve process safety and to eliminate potential hazard points...|$|R

30|$|The European {{rail freight}} industry, {{developed}} on a domestic focus with powerful incumbent railway undertakings, {{has not yet}} developed the necessary collaborative or integrated approach needed {{for the kind of}} total pan-European transport chain widely practiced by maritime shipping lines, for example. There are various reasons for this, including the fact that the multiple actors in multimodal transport chains have, at times, opposing interests. This, coupled with the high level of entry barriers faced by private new entrants, has failed to generate the development of industrialised, pan‐European services to respond to market needs. Moreover, no modern studies of this market have been conducted to evaluate its evolution, anticipate the needed revolution, or suggest new business models suitable to face the challenges due to, among other things, the protectionist attitude of the incumbents towards their market share. The bundling of the various categories of traffic (bulk, containers), the creation of efficient nodes to <b>de-bottleneck</b> by optimising the use of existing infrastructure, the development of fully interoperable Trans‐European Rail Freight Corridors with a powerful governance platform, and coordination with national infrastructure managers, are all progressing too slowly. Overcoming the patchwork of national safety rules, through powerful action by the European Railway Agency (ERA), is progressively arriving at an urgent need to increase the pace. All of these elements have hindered the introduction of pan-European rail services.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Nowadays, the {{production}} of monoclonal antibody using animal cell culture (MAB) requires new improvements. The approach presented in this poster is based on simulation, scheduling optimization and <b>de-bottlenecking</b> of production processes. Mainly an abstraction of the P&I D (Process and instrumentation diagram) is done and the control software for a Biotech Plan is modeled. The modeling of the control software is based on ISA standards: ISA- 88 and ISA- 95. These standards are crucial for optimization and debottlenecking of processes. The simulation of a small scale production facilitates to recognize lowlights and highlights in {{the production}}, improving the results when it is applied to a full scale production...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 8 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Mauritius, 11 - 13 July, 2011. The focus {{of this paper is}} on the dependence between water and energy in industry and the way these resources can be managed in an integrated and more sustainable manner. The fundamental methodology supporting the concept of simultaneous management of water and energy is the process systems approach guided by deep understanding of the simultaneous mass and heat transfer, considering phase and pressure changes. Special attention in this case is paid to the utilisation of the latent heat of water evaporation and condensation (allowing for water and heat recycling). The paper takes a new view to water solutions management especially when processes experience difficulties for direct heat recovery. The paper also highlights the link between water management, heat recovery, process efficiency improvement and capacity <b>de-bottlenecking,</b> which bring additional positive impact of proposed methodologies. The advantages of efficiency improvement, water saving and improved environmental impact of proposed solutions are analysed and demonstrated on an industrial case. pm 201...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} a set of rural Micro Hydro Power (MHP) projects and MHP-implementing organizations in Bolivia, using a learning-based analytical perspective. Rather than identifying a generic set of critical success factors such as access to finance, adequate technological support and management capabilities, project success is viewed as something that results from people's motivation to keep tackling barriers that impede the functioning of their system. Furthermore, the research points up the key importance of encouragement and support of such local <b>de-bottlenecking</b> activities by the MHP-implementing organizations. Interaction with user communities on a long-term basis and inculcation of local project ‘ownership’ through system co-construction and co-improvement are found to be crucial elements in effective institutional support. In order to perform well, the organizations themselves also have to practice continuous performance improvement through learning, and they need to foster the wider exchange of lessons in the MHP sector in the country as a whole. These findings appear to have wider relevance than the Bolivian MHP case as such, and hold important lessons for project implementers and policy makers involved in rural electrification...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the conveyancing process in South Africa with a view to identify how the process might be improved in terms of its efficiency and effectiveness. Land is an asset and still remains a valuable factor in production, even in the modern knowledge economy. In many parts of the world, land is a limited resource, therefore, in most countries, custodianship and ownership of land and landed properties generally tend to be guarded through the meticulous capturing, recording and storage of appropriate data and information. Legislative provisions for the transfer of custodianship and/or ownership require the involvement of a variety of role players in the conveyancing processes that culminate in the registration of land and associated immovable property. In some countries, the conveyancing processes tend to be complex and cumbersome. The study provides a conceptual framework for conveyancing processes based on a content-based review of land and immovable property registration systems in five countries, namely, Barbados, the Netherlands, Australia, Taiwan and South Africa. The study further investigates the South African conveyancing processes. Quantitative questionnaires were completed by six respondent groups from the conveyancing service chain, and qualitative interviews were conducted with two of the four major banks in South Africa. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse the quantitative data, and content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. The findings were used to develop a <b>de-bottlenecking</b> framework for South African conveyancing. Business ManagementM. Com. (Business Management...|$|E
40|$|Case StudyThis {{case study}} {{deals with a}} west Texas {{pipeline}} transfer pump with the following design specifications: Byron Jackson 3 x 6 x 9 E DVMX; BEP at 650 gpm, 3560 rpm, Ns= 1220; Originally 9 stages, 2 impellers were removed, utilizing remaining 7 stages; Directly coupled to a 450 HP electric motor drive. After <b>de-bottlenecking</b> the pipeline to obtain more flow, the motor driver for this pump began overloading at the new, higher flowrates. Horse power calculations suggested that the electric motor driver should have been adequate for the new hydraulic conditions. However, we began to suspect there was an internal pump design problem once {{it was found that}} the field performance diata did not match the original test data. We discovered that the pump was producing 20 % more head than expected at the end-of-curve conditions (900 gpm). Upon disassembly, we found that 8 of the 9 impellers have 8 vanes instead of the expected 7 vanes. (The pump OEM provides both 7 and 8 vane impeller designs.) the OEM?s 4 x 6 x 9 D 8 vane design produces more head past the best efficiency point than the corresponding 7 vane design and does not continuously rise to shutoff. To counteract the additional head producing capability of the 8 vane impellers, we decided to remove 2 stages. After de-staging, the motor overload condition was resolved. It is assumed that someone replaced the original 7 vane impellers with 8 vane impellers to obtain more head and hence more flow with the same pump. This case study clearly illustrates the danger of changing impeller designs without a thorough hydraulic analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide an {{overview}} of the epidemiology of COPD in India which is one of the most affected countries in the world and contributes significantly to the mortality and morbidity of this disease; to provide insights into the etiological determinants of COPD in India; comment on treatment aspects including drug treatment, adherence to guidelines, treatment of exacerbations and to try to comment on whether it differs significantly from rest of the world. The article reviews published literature on COPD in India; provides insight into comparative methodologies involved; comments on gaps in knowledge and suggests areas of further research such as Prescription Audit. India contributes very significantly to mortality from COPD 102. 3 / 100, 000 and 6, 740, 000 DALYs out of world total of 27, 756, 000 DALYs; thus significantly affecting health related Quality of Life in the country. COPD is surpassing Malaria, TB even today and the gap would get wider with time in near future. The lack of robust real time nation-wide data does plague India as well, however multiple studies from 1994 to 2010 show increasing trends of COPD morbidity and mortality. Since most inhalational drugs are available in the country there is no reason why mortality should not be comparable to rest of the world but there is poor adherence to treatment guidelines, both national and international. Urban centers in India are comparable to their global counterparts in terms of service quality and facilities and this is also work in progress. However, the rural hinterland is poorly serviced; national GDP spending on health is remarkably low. Some innovation is emerging and that could be the harbinger of a new future if properly nurtured. The article is an overview of COPD in India with emphasis on understanding the multi-dimensional nature of the problem and an attempt of providing insight into possible <b>de-bottlenecking</b> to reduce the pain and suffering of millions of COPD patients in India in future...|$|E
