25|$|Other {{methods of}} fire {{prevention}} are by directing {{efforts to reduce}} known <b>hazardous</b> <b>conditions</b> or by preventing dangerous acts before tragedy strikes. This is normally accomplished in many innovative ways such as conducting presentations, distributing safety brochures, providing news articles, writing public safety announcements (PSA) or establishing meaningful displays in well-visited areas. Ensuring that each household has working smoke alarms, is educated in the proper techniques of fire safety, has an evacuation route and rendezvous point is of top priority in public education for most fire prevention teams in almost all fire department localities.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} Indian social {{scientists}} {{as well as}} the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have done extensive research on the numeric figures of child labour found in India and determined that India contributes to one-third of Asia’s child labour and one-fourth of the world's child labour. Due to a large number of children being illegally employed, the Indian government began to take extensive actions {{to reduce the number of}} children working, and to focus on the importance of facilitating the proper growth and development of children. International influences help to encourage legal actions to be taken in India, such as the Geneva Declaration of the Right of Children Act was passed in 1924. This act was followed by The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 to which incorporated the basic human rights and needs of children for proper progression and growth in their younger years. These international acts encouraged major changes to the workforce in India which occurred in 1986 when the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act was put into place. This act prohibited hiring children younger than the age of 14, and from working in <b>hazardous</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

This was the first time than an ASEAN summit had been postponed due to inclement weather. Potentially <b>hazardous</b> <b>conditions</b> also delayed humanitarian aid to victims of Typhoon Durian, which struck the Philippines in late November. The first Public Storm Warning Signals for the Philippines were issued by the PAGASA on December8 for several islands in the central Philippines. The third level of the four-tier warning system was issued for Samar, Leyte, and Biliran. With landfall imminent on December9, 15,000people were evacuated to temporary evacuation shelters from around 12villages. This figure increased to 59,000people as landfall occurred and later to 91,121with the storm passing over the Philippines. Most of the evacuees were from Albay due to fears of deadly mudslides and lahars associated with Mount Mayon as witnessed during Typhoon Durian. In addition, the Philippines Office of Civil Defense considered relocating Typhoon Durian refugees in the Bicol Region to special [...] "holding areas".
