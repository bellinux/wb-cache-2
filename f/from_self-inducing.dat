MTPs are now widely used as a culturing vessel for phenotypic screening of aerobic laboratory cultures, and their suitability has been assessed for a range of applications. The work presented here extends these previous studies by assessing the metabolic footprint of MTP fermentation.

We discuss collective neutrino systems using the gyroscopic pendulum analogy and describe the motion that results <b>from</b> <b>self-induced</b> parametric resonances. The effects of dense matter on the flavour oscillations of neutrinos are also detailed. This theory is applied to the case of continuous supernova neutrino spectra and explanations of the spectral swapping behaviour seen in numerical studies are summarized. The results of numerical simulations of supernova oscillations in turbulent supernova backgrounds are presented and discussed. We study the motion of two example supernova neutrino spectra and examine the differences in the dynamics and flavour evolution that results from adding turbulent fluctuations to the supernova matter background. We also investigate the effect that fluctuations in the neutrino density can have on the oscillation behaviour. We find that in general the final neutrino spectra emerging from the inner supernova regions are quite robust to fluctuations in the backgrounds in our model, while the intermediate dynamics can be very strongly altered. Some significant changes in the final spectra are also found to occur when the neutrino background density fluctuations are large. We give a detailed review of the resonant matter effects that determine the survival probabilities of atmospheric muon neutrinos. The differences between various Earth density models are described, and these models are then used to predict the flux of muon-type neutrino events in the Deep Core extension to the IceCube detector.

40|$|The {{visual system}} cannot rely only upon {{information}} from the retina to perceive object motion because identical retinal stimulations can be evoked by the movement of objects {{in the field of}} view {{as well as by the}} movements of retinal images self-evoked by eye movements. We clearly distinguish the two situations, perceiving object motion in the first case and stationarity in the second. The present work deals with the neuronal mechanisms that are likely involved in the detection of real motion. In monkeys, cells that are able to distinguish real <b>from</b> <b>self-induced</b> motion (real-motion cells) are distributed in several cortical areas of the dorsal visual stream. We suggest that the activity of these cells is responsible for motion perception, and hypothesize that these cells are the elements of a cortical network representing an internal map of a stable visual world. Supporting this view are the facts that: (i) the same cortical regions in humans are activated in brain imaging studies during perception of object motion; and (ii) lesions of these same regions produce selective impairments in motion detection, so that patients interpret any retinal image motion as object motion, even when they result from her/his eye movements. Among the areas of the dorsal visual stream rich in real-motion cells, V 3 A and V 6, likely involved in the fast form and motion analyses needed for visual guidance of action, could use real-motion signals to orient the animal’s attention towards moving objects, and/or to help grasping them.

40|$|A near {{infrared}} hybridly mode-locked dye laser system {{consisting of a}} femtosecond oscillator and a high repetition rate dye amplifier was designed and built. This system was then applied {{to the study of}} room temperature below-bandgap femtosecond switching and coherent pulse propagation in GaAs/GaAlAs multiple quantum well waveguides. The noise properties of the oscillator output were studied using radio frequency spectrum analysis techniques. Two distinct modes of operation were identified: The first is characterized by the shortest pulse duration and its real-time autocorrelation signal appears more strongly modulated. The second mode of operation, which exhibits a slightly longer pulse duration and a smoother real-time autocorrelation signal, is obtained for a relative cavity length detuning of ΔL = - 0. 7 μm. Unexpectedly, the second mode features larger pulse duration fluctuations than the first mode and self-pulsing, while the pulse repetition timing and pulse energy fluctuations were found to be similar in both cases, making the first mode preferable for use in time-resolved experiments. Femtosecond all-optical switching under off-resonance room temperature excitation was demonstrated in a passive GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well directional coupler for the first time. The required phase mismatch originates from an ultrafast refractive index change caused by the optical Stark effect. The main obstacle regarding practical device applications is its low transmission (less than 10 %). The use of electrically pumped semiconductor waveguides that provide gain promises to remove this disadvantage. Below-resonance, coherent pulse breakup in a room temperature semiconductor waveguide was observed for the first time. Numerical simulations of the coupled semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch equations show that the light-matter interaction can induce enough chirp through self-phase modulation during propagation in order to violate the initial adiabatic following regime and cause pulse breakup. This coherent effect is distinctly different <b>from</b> <b>self-induced</b> transparency, because it does not involve Rabi-oscillations at the start of propagation, from temporal solitons, because it does not require group velocity dispersion, and from self-steepening.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityIt has been proposed that axisymmetric buoyant jets discharged vertically into a horizontal turbulent boundary layer flow undergo a transition <b>from</b> <b>self-induced</b> mixing to an ultimate state where mixing {{is dominated by the}} shear-flow turbulence. Both plume mixing and ambient shear-flow mixing have been separately well characterized by many previous studies and {{can be thought of as}} asymptotic mixing regimes. This investigation focuses on the transition between the two asymptotic regimes that is not well understood and that is often of particular engineering interest. In this work, we present the results of a detailed experimental analysis of buoyant jet mixing in a turbulent shear flow. Our purpose is to obtain a detailed picture of the turbulent velocity field and the concentration distributions throughout the various mixing regimes in order to discern the effects of changes in various flow parameters on the predominant mixing mechanisms. The experimental technique employs buoyant jets whose fluid is optically homogeneous with that of the ambient shear flow. This enables the combined use oflaser-Doppler velocimetry and laser-induced fluorescence to measure the velocity and concentration profiles, respectively. Dimensional analysis indicates that the cross-flow shear velocity and the plume specific buoyancy flux are the parameters controlling the transition from plume mixing to diffusion mixing. Quantitative analysis of the experimental results indicates that the mixing is dominated entirely by diffusion, or shear-flow mixing, even close to the point of discharge. Further, we observe that within the diflbsive mixing regime, a transition occurs from a region where the turbulent mixing coefficient is proportional to the local elevation to a region where the turbulent mixing coefficient is proportional to the boundary layer thickness. Detailed instantaneous spatial concentration distributions indicate that regions of dilution far below mean values persist well into the mixing regime dominated by shear-flow turbulence. This indicates that both plume mixing an diffusiontype mixing models may provide a false sense of security with regard to the absolute minimum dilutions observed in actual flow situations since both methods focus on the minimum average dilution...|$|R

40|$|This issues paper {{examines}} possible {{changes to}} the law of self-defence in Tasmania, and invites submissions from the public. Background In September 2011, the Director of Public Prosecutions wrote to the Attorney-General to raise concerns that the current Tasmanian law on self-defence, as contained in s 46 of the Criminal Code (Tas), was too lenient and was out of step with modern standards. In November 2012, the Attorney- General requested that the Tasmania Law Reform Institute conduct a far-reaching examination of the law in Tasmania relating to self-defence and provide advice as to whether the law should be amended. In relation to self-defence, this Issues Paper considers whether the current law of self-defence in Tasmania should be retained or whether any amendments should be made to the existing law. It considers the circumstances in which a person is lawfully entitled to use force (including lethal force) in defence of themselves or another person. In cases where the accused’s perception of the situation corresponds with the actual situation, this may appear a relatively intuitive and straightforward assessment. However, greater difficulties arise when {{there is a difference between}} the actual circumstances and the circumstances as the accused saw them. There is scope for considerable debate about the extent to which a person can rely on a mistaken belief for the purposes of self-defence, and whether the reason for the mistake has a role to play in making this assessment. This is the particular concern addressed in this Paper. It considers whether a person should be able to rely on: 	a mistake that results from a delusion arising from a mental illness; 	a mistake that was a result of psychological factors personal to the accused that meant that they were more sensitive to threats of danger than the normal person; or 	a mistake that arises <b>from</b> <b>self-induced</b> intoxication. The Paper also considers whether it is desirable to ensure consistency between the defence of selfdefence and other defences such as prevention of certain crimes and defence of dwelling-house. To this end, it examines issues that arise in relation to defence of property, and the special status the home enjoys as a place of sanctuary. It considers whether the defences of prevention of crime in s 39 and defence of dwelling-house in s 40 of the Criminal Code might more appropriately be dealt with in a consolidated defence provision or whether the defences involve unique considerations that warrant a stand-alone provision.   Submissions are invited from the public, find out more about making a submission here...|$|R
