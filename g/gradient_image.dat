40|$|This paper {{presents}} how using a correspondence-based inter-polation {{scheme for}} 3 D image registration improves the reg-istration accuracy. The interpolator {{takes into account}} corre-spondences across slices, which is an advantage, particularly when the volume has thick slices, and where anatomies lie non-parallel to the slice direction. We use our previously pre-sented approach for correspondence-based interpolation and demonstrate results on two different datasets, brain and car-diac MRI. The results are evaluated (i) qualitatively by ex-amination of <b>gradient</b> <b>images</b> and cardiac pig atlases and (ii) quantitatively by registering downsampled brain data using two different interpolators and subsequently applying the de-formation fields to the original data.

40|$|Summary Differential {{interference}} contrast (DIC) {{is frequently}} used in conventional 2 D biological microscopy. Our recent investi-gations into producing a 3 D DIC microscope (in both conventional and confocal modes) have uncovered a fundamental difficulty: namely that the phase <b>gradient</b> <b>images</b> of DIC microscopy cannot be visualized using standard {{digital image processing}} and reconstruction techniques, as commonly used elsewhere in microscopy. We discuss two approaches {{to the problem of}} preparing <b>gradient</b> <b>images</b> for 3 D visualization: integration and the Hilbert transform. After applying the Hilbert transform, the dataset can then be visualized in 3 D using standard techniques. We find that the Hilbert transform provides a rapid qualitative pre-processing technique for 3 D visualiza-tion {{for a wide range of}} biological specimens in DIC microscopy, including chromosomes, which we use in this study...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCanny's edge {{detection}} algorithm is a classical and robust method for {{edge detection}} in gray-scale images.
