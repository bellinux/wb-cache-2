5000|$|Having already {{imposed a}} seties of trade {{sanctions}} in 2012, Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird imposed additional bans and froze all remaining trade with Iran. This {{came at a}} time when bilateral trade was worth around C$135 million ($130 million USD). This was enacted in protest the Tehran's nuclear ambitions and human rights record. Baird was quoted as saying, [...] "The absence of progress ... leads Canada to ban effectively immediately all <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> <b>from</b> Iran". Statistics Canada's data for 2012 reveals exports to Iran were worth around C$95 million, mostly consisting of cereals, oil seeds, and fruit, as well as chemical products, and machinery. Iranian exports totaled C$40 million, with fruits, nuts, and textiles being most prevalent. Baird delivered his message to an approving audience in Washington at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Baird won an extended standing ovation for reiterating the government’s view that Iran’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon is the most dangerous threat to global security.|$|E

5000|$|The {{trail was}} already {{established}} {{by the time the}} Spanish settlers arrived in 1769; the first inhabitants of the area, including the Kumeyaay tribe, used it to access the beaches of San Diego Bay. It was improved and extended during the Spanish colonization of the region, reaching Old Town San Diego and Mission San Diego de Alcalá in Mission Valley by the 1770s. Cargo which had been unloaded by ship at Ballast Point in Old La Playa was transported along the trail several miles inland to Old Town. The La Playa Trail remained the primary transportation route for <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> <b>from</b> the time of San Diego's establishment in 1769 until the development of a better port in the 1860s at what is now Downtown San Diego.

5000|$|From {{its base}} in Palau, Nan'yō Kōhatsu sent small ships to Dili {{as early as}} 1934 {{in an effort to}} break the {{monopoly}} of Dutch shipping on trade with Portuguese Timor. [...] However, in the summer of 1936, the company reached a secret agreement with the Imperial Japanese Navy to establish more of a foothold in Portuguese Timor, and with Navy funding, the company formed a joint venture in 1937 with the primary plantation company of Portuguese Timor, SAPT. The joint-venture effectively controlled <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> <b>from</b> Portuguese Timor, and by 1940 it was 48% controlled by Nan'yō Kōhatsu. [...] The company also bought out many small private operations {{in the eastern part of}} the Indonesian archipelago, and formed numerous joint ventures with native entrepreneurs. As international tensions increased in the late 1930s, and following the outbreak of war in Europe, the extension of Japanese interests represented by the Nan'yō Kōhatsu greatly concerned the British, Dutch and Australian authorities. Although Portugal and its colonies were neutral throughout the war, the Japanese interest in Timor led to the Allied invasion and occupation of Portuguese Timor in late 1941.|$|E
50|$|Trade {{exchanges between}} the two {{countries}} have doubled over the past five years, from EUR 670 million in 2010 to EUR 1.3 billion in 2015. Bulgaria is also traditional destination for Polish tourists as last year 260,000 Polish tourists visited Bulgarian resorts, the statement said. Statistical data from Bulgaria’s National Statistics Institute confirms the figures and also shows that the trade exchange is more or less balanced, with imports from Poland slightly exceeding exports for the same period. For example, the trade data for 2015 shows that <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> <b>from</b> and to Poland are at about the same level as those with the Netherlands, a traditional investor and trade partner for Bulgaria. Tourist visits from Poland have increased with 7% in 2014 and 3.2% in 2015. In 2015, Poland occupied the 8th spot in the top 10 ranking for most important tourist markets for Bulgaria. In January 2016, the Bulgarian Ministry of Tourism said it expects a 40% {{increase in the number of}} Poles visiting Bulgaria in 2016. Major Bulgarian cities like the capital Sofia and Varna on the Black Sea coast have purchased Polish-made trams and buses for their public transport systems. According to media reports, the total figure of the purchase is valued at about EUR 90 million. Finally, for those observers careful enough to notice, apart from the gross figures, a couple of visits at Bulgarian supermarkets will show the large number of Polish-made goods available for sale.|$|E

5000|$|Port Louis {{was already}} in use as a harbor in 1638. In 1735, under French government, it became the {{administrative}} center of Mauritius and a major reprovisioning halt for French ships during their passage between Asia and Europe, around the Cape of Good Hope. The Port is {{named in honor of}} King Louis XV. During this period of French colonization, Mauritius was known as Ile de France. The French governor at that time, Bertrand-François Mahé de Labourdonnais, contributed {{to the development of the}} city. Since Port Louis was relatively well-protected from strong winds during cyclones by the Moka Mountain Range, Port Louis was selected to house both the main harbor and fort for the island. Value of the port continued during the British occupation of the island during the Napoleonic Wars (1800-15), and helped Britain control the Indian Ocean. However, port calls of ships fell drastically following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Activity in the port increased during the seven-year closure of the Suez Canal (starting in 1967). Modernization of the port in the late 1970s has helped it maintain its role as the central point for all <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> <b>from</b> Mauritius. While Port Louis continues to be the business and administrative capital of Mauritius, expansion of the tourism industry in the late 1990s led to considerable development in Port Louis, with many shops, hotels, and restaurants being built in the Caudan Waterfront area.|$|E
