25|$|The Roman soldier, {{like any}} free and respectable Roman male of status, was {{expected}} to show self-discipline in matters of sex. Augustus (reigned 27 BC–14AD) even prohibited soldiers from marrying, a ban that remained in force for the Imperial army for nearly two centuries. Other forms of sexual gratification available to soldiers were prostitutes of any <b>gender,</b> <b>male</b> slaves, war rape, and same-sex relations. The Bellum Hispaniense, about Caesar's civil war on the front in Roman Spain, mentions an officer who has a male concubine (concubinus) on campaign. Sex among fellow soldiers, however, violated the Roman decorum against intercourse with another freeborn male. A soldier maintained his masculinity by not allowing his body {{to be used for}} sexual purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Lotus Sutra {{describes}} Avalokiteśvara as a bodhisattva who {{can take}} the form of any type of God including Indra or Brahma; any type of Buddha, any type of King or Chakravartin or even any kind of Heavenly Guardian including Vajrapani and Vaisravana as well as any <b>gender</b> <b>male</b> or female, adult or child, human or non-human being, in order to teach the Dharma to sentient beings. Folk traditions in China and other East Asian countries have added many distinctive characteristics and legends to Guanyin c.q. Avalokiteśvara. Avalokiteśvara was originally depicted as a male bodhisattva, and therefore wears chest-revealing clothing and may even sport a light moustache. Although this depiction still exists in the Far East, Guanyin is more often depicted as a woman in modern times. Additionally, some people believe that Guanyin is androgynous or perhaps without gender.|$|E

It {{was also the first}} season in the show's history where all the finalists of one <b>gender</b> (<b>male)</b> were {{eliminated}} before any finalists of the opposite gender, thus making it the first to not only have an all-female top 5, but also the first season since the sixth to produce a female winner, as well as the first season since the third to have a finale consisting of two women. It was also the first season where the judges did not use the [...] "Judges' Save" [...] since its introduction in the eighth season.

A remnant of the masculine gender can still be expressed in the singular definite form of adjectives according to natural <b>gender</b> (<b>male</b> humans), {{in the same way}} as personal pronouns, han/hon, are chosen for representing nouns in contemporary Swedish (male/female human beings and optionally animals).|$|E

50|$|Gender {{issues can}} include {{the way people}} {{identify}} their <b>gender</b> (<b>male,</b> female, genderqueer; transgender or cisgender), how they {{have been affected by}} societal structures related to gender (gender hierarchy), the role of gender in the individual's life (such as stereotypical gender roles), and any other gender related issues. The objective behind this field of study is to understand the individual within the larger social and political aspects of society. Feminist psychology puts a strong emphasis on women's rights. Psychoanalysis took shape as a clinical or therapeutic method, feminism as a political strategy (Buhle, 1998).|$|E

50|$|Males have a {{much higher}} rate of {{completed}} suicide than females. One common {{explanation relies on the}} social constructions of hegemonic masculinity and femininity. In {{a review of the literature}} on <b>gender</b> and suicide, <b>male</b> suicide rates were explained in terms of traditional <b>gender</b> roles. <b>Male</b> <b>gender</b> roles tend to emphasize greater levels of strength, independence, and risk-taking behavior. Reinforcement of this gender role often prevents males from seeking help for suicidal feelings and depression.|$|R

50|$|Pronouns in Maa usually assign <b>gender</b> (<b>male,</b> female, or place); if {{gender is}} unknown, {{the meaning of}} the noun in context will usually refer to a gender. For example, the context of a female might include working in the house while a male gender would be implied if the action {{referred}} to work outside the home. The Maasai language uses place as a personal pronoun because place can help identify male or female (i.e. an action occurring in the house will almost always be done by a female).|$|E
5000|$|The newer term [...] "Mx" [...] avoids specifying gender {{not only}} for persons who wish not to {{indicate}} a binary <b>gender</b> (<b>male</b> or female) but also for persons whose gender identity does not fit the gender binary. Honorifics are used in situations when it is inappropriate to refer to someone only by their first or last name, such as when addressing a letter [...] "Dear Mx Jones" [...] or when introducing the person to others. Activists, supporters and others are working toward awareness and acceptance of alternative honorifics including Mx.|$|E

The two main exceptions are a right of conscience for Church of England clergy (who are normally obliged to marry any two eligible people by law), and that the descent of peerages will remain unchanged. Additionally, sports organisations are allowed to exclude transsexual people if it is necessary for 'fair competition or the safety of the competitors'.|$|E

50|$|As {{discussed}} by Paula Rothernberg in her novel Invisible Privilege: A Memoir About Race, Class, and <b>Gender,</b> <b>male</b> privilege often takes institutionalized and embedded forms from which men may directly benefit. These instances of male privilege systems may attribute to male over empowerment {{and can help}} explain man’s sense of centrality {{in some of the}} most powerful institutions. An example of male privilege in institutionalized academic settings can be observed by the prevalence of men in how curriculums are formed and history and literature is taught across the United States. Historically, all those who have held the title of President of the United States have been male. American government on the national level, including the United States Senate and the United States Congress, is also predominantly male.|$|E

50|$|After {{logging on}} to All New Gen, the first {{question}} asked of game players is: 'What is your <b>gender?</b> <b>Male,</b> Female, Neither.'

In 1994 All New Gen was well received at the International Symposium on Electronic Art in Helsinki after which it toured to a number of galleries and art spaces in Australia, Europe, the United States, Canada and Japan. VNS Matrix was later awarded a $100,000 grant from the Australian Film Commission to develop a prototype of an All Gen CD-ROM game for international distribution called Bad Code, which included a number of enhancements including sophisticated new images, 3D graphic spaces, animations, video sequences, characters and zones.|$|E
