One person at the studio refused to work on this episode because they did not agree with the portrayal of some of the religious content. Cohen also noted that the writing team had begun to loosen up during this episode, which gave it a feel similar to the series' later episodes. Kaplan claimed that before editing, there was enough material to make a three-part episode.|$|E

500|$|Tasso, {{based on}} the life of sixteenth-century Italian poet, Torquato Tasso, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> both Liszt's working method and his {{achievements}} based on restless experimentation. The 1849 version following a conventional overture layout, divided into a slow section ("Lament") and a fast one ("Triumph"). Even with this division, the entire work was actually a set of variations on a single melody—a folk hymn sung to Liszt by a gondolier in Venice in the late 1830s. Among the most significant revisions Liszt made was the addition of a middle section in the vein of a minuet. The theme of the minuet was, again, a variant of the gondolier's folk hymn, thus becoming another example of thematic transformation. Calmer than either of the outer sections, it was intended to depict Tasso's more stable years in the employment of the Este family in Ferrara. In a margin note, Liszt informs the conductor that the orchestra [...] "assumes a dual role" [...] in this section; strings play a self-contained piece {{based on the}} original version of the gondolier's hymn while woodwinds play another based on the variation used in the minuet. This was very much in the manner of Italian composer Pietro Raimondi, whose contrapuntal mastery was such that he had written three oratoriosJoseph, Potiphar and Jacobwhich could be performed either individually or together. Liszt made a study of Raimondi's work but the Italian composer died before Liszt could meet him personally. While the minuet section was probably added to act as a musical bridge between the opening lament and final triumphal sections, it along with other modifications [...] "rendered the 'Tasso Overture' an overture no longer". The piece became [...] "far too long and developed" [...] to be considered an overture and was redesignated a symphonic poem.|$|E

2500|$|Alan Baddeley's {{theory of}} working memory has yet another aspect to which memory {{can be stored}} short term. [...] The visuo-spatial sketchpad is this store that holds visual {{information}} for manipulation. [...] The visuo-spatial sketchpad {{is thought to be}} its own storage of working memory in that it does not interfere with the short term processes of the phonological loop. [...] In research, it has been found that the visuo-spatial sketchpad can work simultaneously with the phonological loop to process both auditory and visual stimuli without either of the processes affecting the efficacy of the other. [...] Baddeley re-defined the theory of short-term memory as a working memory to explain this phenomenon. [...] In the original theory of short-term memory, it is understood that a person only has one store of immediate information processing which could only hold a total of 7 items plus or minus two items to be stored in {{a very short period of}} time, sometimes a matter of seconds. [...] The digit-span test <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a measurement for classically defined short-term memory.

2500|$|The triumphal arch at {{the head}} of the nave was at first {{referred}} to as the apse arch, but later became known as the triumphal arch. The triumphal arch is illustrated with magnificent mosaics depicting different scenes of Christ and the Virgin Mary. There was a difference in the styles used in the triumphal arch mosaics compared to those of the nave; the style of the triumphal arch was much more linear and flat as one scholar describes it, not nearly as much action, emotion and movement in them as there were in the Old Testament mosaics of the nave. One of the first scenes that were visible on the triumphal arch was a panel of Christ's enthronement with a group of angels as his court. As one historian describes it: [...] "On the apse arch Christ is enthroned, a young emperor attended by four chamberlains, angels of course", this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> mosaic art in the 5th century. Another panel found on the triumphal arch is of the Virgin, she is crowned and dressed in a colorful veil, her wardrobe subtly brings to mind that of a Roman empress and in this panel she has her divine son walking with her and a suite of angels and Joseph ready to greet her; [...] "The Virgin...shows to perfection the impressionistic character of mosaics." [...] Another panel is known as the Adoration of the Magi and this mosaic depicts Infant Christ and The Virgin and the arrival of the three wise men, [...] "mosaics illustrating Christ's first coming and his youth covered the triumphal arch."
