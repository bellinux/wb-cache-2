5000|$|The Continental Cowley, {{shown to}} the press in April 1915, was a larger engined (1495 cc against 1018 cc), longer, wider and better {{equipped}} version of the first Morris Oxford with the same [...] "Bullnose" [...] radiator; in addition it could carry a four-passenger body. To reduce the price many components were bought from United States suppliers. The 1495 cc, side valve, four cylinder engine was made by Continental Motor Manufacturing Company of Detroit, and the clutch and three speed gearbox by Detroit Gear & Machine Co. Back <b>axle,</b> <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> and steering <b>gear</b> also came from the USA. Supply of these components was badly affected by World War I. The suspension used semi elliptic leaf springs at the front and three quarter elliptics at the rear.|$|R
2500|$|The M1009 Blazer used 10-bolt <b>axles</b> (<b>front</b> and rear) {{featuring}} 3.08:1 gears. [...] The {{rear axle}} {{was equipped with}} an Eaton Automatic Differential Lock (ADL) [...] while the front was a standard open differential. The M1008 trucks used open Dana 60 <b>front</b> <b>axles,</b> with the M1028 and M1031 variations often having a Trac-Lok limited slip. In the rear, the M1008s used the GM [...] 10.5" [...] Corporate 14 Bolt Differential with No-Spin lockers (the commercial trade name for the Detroit Locker). Rear axles on M1028A2 and A3 duallies are Dana 70 HD. The <b>axle</b> <b>gear</b> ratios were 4.56:1.|$|R
50|$|The Country Buggy {{was based}} on an Australian-made Type 1 {{platform}} with engine, gearbox and <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> from the Type 1. The rear swing <b>axles</b> had reduction <b>gears</b> from a 1st generation Volkswagen Transporter (1950-1967).|$|R
50|$|In general, Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> are uncommon, due to {{attributes}} that the Dana 60 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> can match. The main advantage a Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> has over a Dana 60 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is better gross axle weight ratings.|$|R

50|$|The SuperSteer <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> {{reduces the}} turn {{radius of the}} tractor. The <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> beam turns with the wheels to give an {{effective}} turn angle of 65°. The tractor turns tighter and faster so it spends less time turning and more time working. The SuperSteer <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> also increases the wheelbase, {{with the weight of}} the front ballast resting directly on the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> beam. Traction is enhanced in certain conditions without need for extra ballast.|$|R
50|$|The Unimog 404 {{is a small}} four-wheel offroad capable truck {{designed}} for a payload of 1,500 kg. Like other Unimogs, it has a ladder frame, two portal <b>axles</b> with reduction <b>gears</b> and coil springs with hydraulic shock absorbers for the rear and <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b> All four wheels and tyres have {{the same size and}} are fitted with hydraulic ATE drum brakes. The 404 is a rear-wheel-drive vehicle with switchable all-wheel-drive and an additional differential lock.|$|R
5000|$|Active Drive Low {{includes}} {{all of the}} features of Active Drive I but denotes a greater possible crawl ratio. When in [...] "4-Low" [...] mode the <b>front</b> and rear <b>axles</b> are locked together and power is sent to all four-wheels through the power transfer unit although no low range gear reduction occurs. Active Drive low relies on shorter <b>axle</b> <b>gear</b> ratios while holding first gear in the ZF9HP transmission to achieve a crawl ratio of 20:1; similar in effect to Freedom Drive II.|$|R
5000|$|The first Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> {{was used}} in 1958 by Dodge in the W300, in both 4.88 and 5.87 ratios. International started using Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> in the late 1960s. Both {{companies}} used Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> until the mid-1970s (Dodge W300 pickup up until 1978, discontinued in 1979). All of these Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> were closed knuckle, with king pins and had a GAWR of 6000 lbs. Like the rear Dana 70 axles, the Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> started out with 23 spline axle shafts {{and then went to}} 35 spline axle shafts. While these axles were being manufactured, Dana offered a [...] "Power-Lok" [...] limited slip differential for some of these axles.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fatigue failure {{has become}} a major concern in the {{automobile}} and aircraft industry, heavy machinery etc. Failures by fatigue are especially dangerous because they are unpredictable; giving no prior notification of the imminent failure they occur suddenly. <b>Front</b> <b>axle</b> of tractor {{is one of the major}} and very important components that undergo severe load conditions and it fails unexpectedly causes unrecoverable losses. The objective of this study is to analyze the existing design of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> of the tractor for service load conditions and redesign to its functional requirements and to increase its life expectations. Finite element simulation is carried out for the existing <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> using ANSYS. The critical location of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> has to be identified and redesigned to ensure the safety. The existing geometry of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is modified to the optimum size which suits for functional requirements with increased life and minimum cost. In this analysis, the geometry of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is modified and a new design is proposed. The life expectancy of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> was predicted for the dynamic load using ANSYS fatigue design module...|$|R

50|$|Historically, this {{designation}} {{was used}} {{regardless of whether}} the entire engine was behind the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> line. In recent times, the manufactures of some cars have added to the designation with the term front-mid which describes a car where the engine is in front of the passenger compartment but behind the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b> Most pre-World War II front engine cars would qualify as front-mid engine, using the front-mid designation, or on the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. After {{preliminary}} design of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is finished, {{finite element analysis}} module of CATIA {{is used to calculate}} the distribution of stress field and displacement field of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> in the working conditions of vertical static loading, emergency braking as well as side slipping of bus, and then the conclusion will be reached to provide theory basis for <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> design of the whole project. Preface Most of city buses are two or three steps, the height of its floor is 600 mm～ 700 mm, for this kinds of buses, the common <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> can meet the challenge. With the development of urban transportation and the growth in the living standard, two or three steps buses have inconvenient problem for particular group and waste times to get up and down the bus. A city needs one step buses {{to meet the needs of}} all kinds of people. To achieve this requirement, the bus floor height should be lower. The bus floor height is about 360 mm～ 400 mm. To lower floor height means the space under the axle is to be decreased, as shown in fig. 1. To resolve this problem, the key is to design large fall low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> and full-scale finite element analysis of the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b> The paper analyzes the load conditions of vertical static of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle,</b> emergenc...|$|R

50|$|Dana 27 axles {{were used}} for the front and rear wheels in the 80 and 800 models until circa 1968. Both front and rear {{differentials}} were offset to the passenger side for the purpose of lining up the driveshafts with the Dana 18 transfer case. With the transition to the 800A model, the rear axle was upgraded to a Dana 44, with a centered differential mated to the Dana 20 transfer case (which had replaced the Dana 18). Some Scouts from this transitional time are a mix of old and new designs, with the rear driveshaft running at an angle. The <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> was still a Dana 27 model, though if the buyer ordered the 3500 lb. <b>axle</b> option the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> was upgraded to a hybrid unit built from a Dana 30 centersection and 27 tubes. The V8 engine option included an automatic upgrade to the heavier duty Dana 30 axle. The rear axle shafts changed from two pieces to one piece circa 1968 or 1969. A Powr-Lok limited slip differential was provided as an option for both <b>front</b> and rear <b>axles.</b> Common <b>gear</b> ratios are 3.31, 3.73, 4.27, though nearly any ratio was available by special order (there is at least one instance where a Scout 800 was shipped with a 5.71).|$|R
