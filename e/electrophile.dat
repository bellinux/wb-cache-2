5|$|Being the {{smallest}} alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded covalently. Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, {{and tend to}} form oligomers with the structure (RLi)x where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. For use as bases, butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CH3Li)x), which exists in tetrameric (x = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric (x = 6, octahedral) forms. Organolithium compounds, especially n-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, {{as might be expected}} given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which {{plays an important role in}} the Grignard reaction. For example, alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls. The reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl, for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde (using H+ as the <b>electrophile)</b> or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.|$|E
25|$|The Prins {{reaction}} {{occurs when}} a nucleophilic alkene or alkyne reacts with an aldehyde as <b>electrophile.</b> The product of the Prins reaction varies with reaction conditions and substrates employed.|$|E
25|$|A typical modern aldol {{addition}} reaction, shown above, {{might involve}} the nucleophilic {{addition of a}} ketone enolate to an aldehyde. Once formed, the aldol product can sometimes lose a molecule of water to form an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. This is called aldol condensation. A variety of nucleophiles may be employed in the aldol reaction, including the enols, enolates, and enol ethers of ketones, aldehydes, and many other carbonyl compounds. The electrophilic partner is usually an aldehyde or ketone (many variations, such as the Mannich reaction, exist). When the nucleophile and <b>electrophile</b> are different, the reaction is called a crossed aldol reaction; on the converse, when the nucleophile and <b>electrophile</b> are the same, the reaction is called an aldol dimerization.|$|E

40|$|The {{applications}} of nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling strategy to {{the synthesis of}} organofluorine compounds are explored in this thesis. Chapter 2 describes {{the development of the}} first enantioselective cross-coupling method using secondary geminal dihalides as <b>electrophiles.</b> This method provides a unique approach for the generation of enantioenriched tertiary alkyl fluorides. These cross-coupling products can be further transformed into a variety of potentially valuable chiral building blocks. Chapter 3 describes the development of a practical and versatile Negishi alkylation method employing α-halo-α-perfluoroalkyl secondary <b>electrophiles.</b> Target molecules bearing perfluoroalkyl-substituted (including trifluoromethyl-substituted) tertiary carbons can be easily generated from fluorinated <b>electrophiles.</b> Competition experiments and mechanistic studies have been performed to reveal the unique properties of these <b>electrophiles</b> and also prove the existence of alkyl radicals. Chapter 4 describes the development of an asymmetric Negishi arylation protocol with α-halo-α-trifluoromethyl secondary <b>electrophiles.</b> This study provides a unique approach to construct trifluoromethyl-substituted tertiary stereocenters. The optimized condition can also be directly applied to substrates bearing an array of fluoroalkyl groups. Chapter 5 details the progress towards the development of an asymmetric alkynylation method employing α-halo-α-trifluoromethyl secondary <b>electrophiles.</b> Preliminary studies also demonstrate that the protocol we developed {{has the potential to be}} used for other non-fluorinated secondary <b>electrophiles.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|Instead of catalyzing the Pictet-Spengler {{cyclization}} {{with strong}} acid, one can acylate the iminium ion forming the intermediate N-acyliminium ion.

25|$|The {{method has}} also been applied to the {{synthesis}} of enantiopure benzyl amines in scheme 3, which involves ortho-lithiation of tert-butyl phenyl sulfoxide. On approach to the lithium intermediate, the bulky tosyl group on the imine <b>electrophile</b> {{is responsible for the}} asymmetric induction taking place.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{nucleophilic}} sulfur in methionine {{is responsible}} for attacking BrCN, the sulfur in cysteine does not behave similarly. If the sulfur in cysteine attacked cyanogen bromide, the bromide ion would deprotonate the cyanide adduct, leaving the sulfur uncharged and the beta carbon of the cysteine not electrophilic. The strongest <b>electrophile</b> would then be the cyanide nitrogen, which, if attacked by water, would yield cyanic acid and the original cysteine.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, aryl and alkenyl nonaflates {{are useful}} as <b>electrophiles</b> in palladium catalyzed cross coupling reactions. Their reactivity generally mirrors {{that of the}} more commonly encountered triflate <b>electrophiles,</b> but nonaflates {{tend to be less}} prone to hydrolysis to ketones (in the case of alkenyl sulfonates) and phenols (in the case of aryl sulfonates). Their resistance to hydrolysis makes nonaflates superior <b>electrophiles</b> in Buchwald-Hartwig couplings, where this side reaction can be deleterious to yields of the desired product.|$|R

Importantly, many <b>electrophiles</b> can form reversible covalent adducts with both proteins and small-molecule thiols in cells. This post-translational protein modification has important ramifications, including changes in protein enzymatic activity, the transduction of signals within and between cells, and alterations in gene expression. <b>Electrophiles</b> modulate a variety of cellular signaling processes that are involved in several major diseases with inflammatory components.

25|$|If the {{addition}} of a functional group takes place at the less substituted carbon atom of the double bond, then the electrophilic substitution with acids is not possible. In this case, one has to use the hydroboration–oxidation reaction, where in the first step, the boron atom acts as <b>electrophile</b> and adds to the less substituted carbon atom. At the second step, the nucleophilic hydroperoxide or halogen anion attacks the boron atom.|$|E
25|$|The aldol {{reaction}} may proceed via two {{fundamentally different}} mechanisms. Carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones, {{can be converted}} to enols or enol ethers. These species, being nucleophilic at the α-carbon, can attack especially reactive protonated carbonyls such as protonated aldehydes. This is the 'enol mechanism'. Carbonyl compounds, being carbon acids, can also be deprotonated to form enolates, which are much more nucleophilic than enols or enol ethers and can attack electrophiles directly. The usual <b>electrophile</b> is an aldehyde, since ketones are much less reactive. This is the 'enolate mechanism'.|$|E
25|$|In the Ireland model, the {{deprotonation}} {{is assumed}} to proceed by a six-membered or cyclic monomeric transition state. The larger of the two substituents on the <b>electrophile</b> (in the case above, methyl is larger than proton) adopts an equatorial disposition in the favored transition state, leading to a preference for E enolates. The model clearly fails in many cases; for example, if the solvent mixture is changed from THF to 23% HMPA-THF (as seen above), the enolate geometry is reversed, which is inconsistent with this model and its cyclic transition state.|$|E

40|$|The first {{asymmetric}} Kumada {{reactions of}} alkyl <b>electrophiles</b> are described, specifically, cross-couplings of racemic α-bromoketones with aryl Grignard reagents. Several {{features of this}} investigation are of interest. First, the couplings proceed at remarkably low temperature (− 40 °C or − 60 °C), which enables the asymmetric synthesis of racemization-prone α-arylketones. Second, dialkyl ketones undergo enantioselective coupling in good ee and yield. Third, readily available bis (oxazolines) are shown {{for the first time}} to be effective ligands for cross-couplings of alkyl <b>electrophiles,</b> thereby opening the door to new opportunities in asymmetric catalysis. Transition metal-catalyzed couplings of organic <b>electrophiles</b> with Grignard reagents (“Kumada reactions”) were among the first cross-coupling processes that were discovered. 1, 2 Like other families of cross-couplings, this versatile method for the synthesis of carbon– carbon bonds has been applied primarily to reactions of aryl and vinyl <b>electrophiles.</b> 3 It is nevertheless noteworthy that the earliest successes in cross-coupling alkyl <b>electrophiles</b> were Kumada-type reactions with Grignard reagents. 4, 5, 6 Despite that initial progress, to date there have been no examples of enantioselective Kumada couplings of alkyl <b>electrophiles.</b> 7, 8, 9 In this report, we begin to address this challenge, establishing that a Ni/bis(oxazoline) catalyst achieves asymmetric cross-couplings of α-bromoketones with aryl Grignard reagents (eq 1). 10, 11 With respect to enantioselective cross-coupling reactions of alkyl <b>electrophiles,</b> pybox ligands have proved to be useful for an array of nickel-catalyzed Negishi reactions, whereas 1, 2 -diamine ligands have found application in Hiyama and Suzuki reactions. 8 Unfortunately, non...|$|R
25|$|The general {{principle}} is outlined in scheme 1. An {{aromatic ring system}} with a DMG group 1 interacts with an alkyllithium such as n-butyllithium in its specific aggregation state (hence (R-Li)n) to intermediate 2 since the hetero atom on the DMG is a Lewis base and lithium the Lewis acid. The very basic alkyllithium then deprotonates the ring in the nearest ortho- position forming the aryllithium 3 all the while maintaining the acid-base interaction. An <b>electrophile</b> reacts in the next phase in an electrophilic aromatic substitution with a strong preference for the lithium ipso position replacing the lithium atom.|$|E
25|$|The {{systematic}} name of pyridine, within the Hantzsch–Widman nomenclature {{recommended by the}} IUPAC, is azine. However, {{systematic name}}s for simple compounds are used very rarely; instead, heterocyclic nomenclature follows historically established common names. IUPAC discourages the use of azine in favor of pyridine. The numbering of the ring atoms in pyridine starts at the nitrogen (see infobox). An allocation of positions by letter of the Greek alphabet (α-γ) and the substitution pattern nomenclature common for homoaromatic systems (ortho, meta, para) are used sometimes. Here α (ortho), β (meta), and γ (para) refer to the 2, 3, and 4 position, respectively. The systematic name for the pyridine derivatives is pyridinyl, wherein {{the position of the}} substituted atom is preceded by a number. However, here again the historical name pyridyl is encouraged by the IUPAC and used instead of the systematic name. The cationic derivative formed by the addition of an <b>electrophile</b> to the nitrogen atom is called pyridinium.|$|E
25|$|A {{specific}} experiment {{example of}} an application of native gel electrophoresis is to check for enzymatic activity to verify {{the presence of the}} enzyme in the sample during protein purification. For example, for the protein alkaline phosphatase, the staining solution is a mixture of 4-chloro-2-2methylbenzenediazonium salt with 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2’-4’-dimethyl aniline in Tris buffer. This stain is commercially sold as kit for staining gels. If the protein is present, the mechanism of the reaction takes place in the following order: it starts with the de-phosphorylation of 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2’-4’-dimethyl aniline by alkaline phosphatase (water is needed for the reaction). The phosphate group is released and replaced by an alcohol group from water. The <b>electrophile</b> 4- chloro-2-2 methylbenzenediazonium (Fast Red TR Diazonium salt) displaces the alcohol group forming the final product Red Azo dye. As its name implies, this is the final visible-red product of the reaction. In undergraduate academic experimentation of protein purification, the gel is usually ran next to commercial purified samples in order to visualize the results and make confusions of whether or not purification was successful.|$|E

500|$|Iodine monofluoride (IF) is {{unstable}} at {{room temperature}} and disproportionates very readily and irreversibly to iodine and iodine pentafluoride, and thus cannot be obtained pure. It can be synthesised from the reaction of iodine with fluorine gas in trichlorofluoromethane at −45°C, with iodine trifluoride in trichlorofluoromethane at −78°C, or with silver(I) fluoride at 0°C. Iodine monochloride (ICl) and iodine monobromide (IBr), on the other hand, are moderately stable. The former, a volatile red-brown compound, was discovered independently by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Humphry Davy in 1813–4 {{not long after the}} discoveries of chlorine and iodine, and it mimics the intermediate halogen bromine so well that Justus von Liebig was misled into mistaking bromine (which he had found) for iodine monochloride. Iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide may be prepared simply by reacting iodine with chlorine or bromine {{at room temperature}} and purified by fractional crystallisation. Both are quite reactive and attack even platinum and gold, though not boron, carbon, cadmium, lead, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, and tungsten. Their reaction with organic compounds depends on conditions. Iodine chloride vapour tends to chlorinate phenol and salicyclic acid, since when iodine chloride undergoes homolytic dissociation, chlorine and iodine are produced and the former is more reactive. However, iodine chloride in tetrachloromethane solution results in iodination being the main reaction, since now heterolytic fission of the I–Cl bond occurs and I+ attacks phenol as an <b>electrophile.</b> However, iodine monobromide tends to brominate phenol even in tetrachloromethane solution because it tends to dissociate into its elements in solution, and bromine is more reactive than iodine.
