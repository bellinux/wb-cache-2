5|$|The <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> {{is one of}} 35 {{species in}} the oceanic dolphin family, which first {{appeared}} about 11 million years ago. The <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter. Although it has morphological similarities with the pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> the false <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> and the pilot whales, a study of cytochrome b gene sequences by Richard LeDuc indicated that its closest extant relatives are the snubfin dolphins of the genus Orcaella.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of an extinct relative, Globicephala baereckeii, {{have been}} found in Pleistocene {{deposits}} in Florida. Another Globicephala dolphin was discovered in Pliocene strata in Tuscany, Italy, and was named G. eturia. The pilot whales were also close relatives of the extinct blunt-snouted dolphin. Close living relatives of the pilot whales are the melon-headed whale, the pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> the false <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> and Risso's dolphin.|$|E

50|$|Behavioral {{differences}} {{can also be}} used to differentiate pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> from false <b>killer</b> <b>whales.</b> Pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> usually move slowly when at the surface whereas false <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> are highly energetic. Pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> rarely bow ride but it is common in false <b>killer</b> <b>whales.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{three species}} can be {{differentiated}} by physical differences between them. One defining difference between pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> and melon-headed whales {{is that although}} both species have white around the mouth, on pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> the white extends back onto the face. Pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> also have rounded tips as opposed to pointed tips on their dorsal fins. When compared to false <b>killer</b> <b>whales,</b> pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> have a larger dorsal fin. Finally, pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> have a more clearly defined line where the dark dorsal color changes to the lighter lateral color than either {{of the other two}} species.|$|R
5|$|Killer whales {{have also}} been {{observed}} preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. <b>Killer</b> <b>whale</b> cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but {{this is likely to}} be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.|$|E
5|$|Northeast Pacific {{resident}} groups {{tend to be}} {{much more}} vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are insensitive to <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> calls (inferred from the audio-gram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.|$|E
5|$|According to some authors, {{the name}} <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> is a {{mistranslation}} of the 18th century Spanish name asesina-ballenas which means literally whale killer. Basque whalers {{would have given}} it such name after observing pods of orcas hunting baleen whales.|$|E
40|$|Public {{signaling}} {{plays an}} important role in territorial and sexual displays in animals; however, in certain situations, it is advantageous to keep signaling private to prevent eavesdropping by unintended receivers. In the northeastern Pacific, two populations of <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> (Orcinus orca), fish-eating “resident” <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> and mammal-eating “transient” <b>killer</b> <b>whales,</b> share the same habitat. Previous studies have shown that residents use whistles as private signals during close-range communication, where they probably serve to coordinate behavioral interactions. Here, we investigated the whistling behavior of mammal-eating <b>killer</b> <b>whales,</b> and, based on divergent social structures and social behaviors between residents and transients, we predicted to find differences in both whistle usage and whistle parameters. Our results show that, like resident <b>killer</b> <b>whales,</b> transients produce both variable and stereotyped whistles. However, clear differences in whistle parameters between ecotypes show that the whistle repertoire of mammal-eating <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> is clearly distinct from and less complex than that of fish-eating <b>killer</b> <b>whales.</b> Furthermore, mammal-eating <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> only produce whistles during “milling after kill” and “surface-active” behaviors, but are almost completely silent during all other activities. Nonetheless, whistles of transient <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> may still serve a role similar to that of resident <b>killer</b> <b>whales.</b> Mammal-eating <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> seem to be under strong selection to keep their communication private from potential prey (whose hearing ranges overlap with that of <b>killer</b> <b>whales),</b> and they appear to accomplish this mainly by restricting vocal activity rather than by changes in whistle parameters...|$|R

5|$|Killer {{whales in}} many areas may prey on {{cormorants}} and gulls. A captive <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> at MarineLand discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat the birds. Four others then learned to copy the behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Sea lions are preyed on by {{killer whales}} and large sharks. At Monterey Bay, California sea lions {{appear to be}} the more common food items for {{transient}} mammal-eating <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> pods. The sea lions may respond to the dorsal fin of a <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. Sea lions are also common prey for white sharks. They have been found with scars made by attacks from both white sharks and shortfin mako sharks. Sharks attack sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. Sea lions that are attacked in the hindquarters are more likely to survive and make it to the shore.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Pacific Northwest Coast feature killer whales throughout their art, history, spirituality and religion. The Haida regarded killer whales {{as the most powerful}} animals in the ocean, and their mythology tells of killer whales living in houses and towns under the sea. According to these myths, they took on human form when submerged, and humans who drowned went to live with them. For the Kwakwaka'wakw, the <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> was regarded as the ruler of the undersea world, with sea lions for slaves and dolphins for warriors. In Nuu-chah-nulth and Kwakwaka'wakw mythology, killer whales may embody the souls of deceased chiefs. The Tlingit of southeastern Alaska regarded the <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> as custodian of the sea and a benefactor of humans.|$|E

40|$|Behavior of <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> {{feeding on}} herring schools was {{recorded}} {{with a high}} frequency (455 kHz) sonar and recorded on a SVHS tape. Synchroniz-ation of surfacing behavior of <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> was analyzed from 8 mm videotapes recorded between 1990 – 92. Two different feeding techniques, carousel feeding, where <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> cooperatively herd herring schools into a tight ball towards the surface and feed on herring which have been stunned by tailslaps, and subsurface feeding were observed and compared. Subsurface feeding <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> showed less coordination and spent less time around the herring schools than carousel feeding <b>killer</b> <b>whales.</b> Both feeding techniques were employed mainly in the upper 20 m of water but only carousel feeding <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> brought the herring school to the surface. Subsurface feeding <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> were observed approaching herring schools down to 98 m, but no feeding could be verified when the whales were deeper than 20 m. The possible causes for different techniques employed by <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> feeding on herring are discussed {{as well as the}} apparent similarity of predator–antipredator behavior between schooling fish and their predators regardless of the species in question...|$|R
5|$|Captive <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> lifespans are {{typically}} significantly shorter, usually less than 25 years; however, numerous individuals are alive in their 30s, {{and a few}} have reached their 40s. Killer whales are unique among cetaceans, as their heads become relatively shorter as they age, i.e., the orca's caudal section enlongates more-so relative to its head.|$|E
5|$|Claudius {{celebrated the}} Secular games—a {{religious}} festival {{that had been}} revived by Augustus—to mark the 800th anniversary {{of the founding of}} Rome. He also on at least one occasion participated in a wild animal hunt himself according to Pliny the Elder, setting out with the Praetorian cohorts to fight a <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> which was trapped in the harbor of Ostia.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin sometimes forms mixed species groups with other species from the dolphin family, particularly larger species, {{such as the}} short-finned pilot whale, the false <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> and Risso's dolphin. They also interact with smaller species, such as the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the rough-toothed dolphin. While interactions with smaller species are sometimes affiliative, {{they can also be}} hostile.|$|E

5|$|Competition with {{fishermen}} {{also led}} to <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> being regarded as pests. In {{the waters of the}} Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> captured in Puget Sound for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.|$|R
500|$|Other {{populations have}} not been as well studied, {{although}} specialized fish and mammal eating <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> have been distinguished elsewhere. In addition, separate populations of [...] "generalist" [...] (fish- and mammal-eating) and [...] "specialist" [...] (mammal-eating) <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> have been identified off northwestern Europe. As with residents and transients, the lifestyle of these whales appears to reflect their diet; fish-eating <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> in Alaska and Norway have resident-like social structures, while mammal-eating <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> in Argentina and the Crozet Islands behave more like transients.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with these}} disappearances, a <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> carcass bearing large wounds is beached. Police Chief Martin Brody {{believes}} that these events are {{the work of}} a shark. Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who highly doubts that the town has another shark problem. Later, Brody finds debris from the destroyed speedboat in the surf just off the beach. He wades over to retrieve it and uncovers the boat driver's burnt remains.|$|E
5|$|Day-to-day <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> {{behaviour}} generally {{consists of}} foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour {{at the surface}} such as breaching (jumping {{completely out of the}} water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) {{changed its}} {{assessment}} of the killer whale's conservation status from conservation dependent to data deficient, recognizing that one or more <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> types may actually be separate, endangered species. Depletion of prey species, pollution, large-scale oil spills, and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are currently the most significant worldwide threats.|$|E

40|$|Occurrence of <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> in Norway {{is linked}} to the {{migration}} of the herring population with most sightings during wintertime.

5|$|Orcinus orca is {{the only}} {{recognized}} extant species in the genus Orcinus, one of many animal species originally described by Linnaeus in 1758 in Systema Naturae. Konrad Gessner wrote the first scientific description of a <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> in his Piscium & aquatilium animantium natura of 1558, {{part of the larger}} Historia animalium, based on examination of a dead stranded animal in the Bay of Greifswald that had attracted a great deal of local interest.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> {{can often}} be identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E
5|$|Large whales, such as mysticetes, are {{not usually}} subject to predation, but smaller whales, such as monodontids or ziphiids, are. These species are preyed on by the <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> or orca. To subdue and kill whales, orcas {{continuously}} ram them with their heads; this can sometimes kill bowhead whales, or severely injure them. Other times they corral the narwhals or belugas before striking. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer orcas, but they are seldom attacked by an individual. Calves are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can be targeted as well.|$|E

5|$|In {{the tales}} {{and beliefs of}} the Siberian Yupik people, <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> are said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> in summer. <b>Killer</b> <b>whales</b> are {{believed}} to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them. <b>Killer</b> <b>whales</b> were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to {{allow themselves to be}} killed.|$|R
