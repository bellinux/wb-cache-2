50|$|AME-133v is a humanized IgG1 {{monoclonal}} antibody targeting the CD20 antigen on both healthy and malignant B-lymphocytes, engineered at Applied Molecular Evolution. Libraries of antibody Fab (fragment, antigen binding) regions were generated with codon substituted {{variations of the}} antibody complementarity determining regions (CDRs) inserted into human antibody light and heavy chain germline frameworks (<b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>file</b> at Mentrik Biotec). Variants were expressed and selected based on increased binding affinity to CD20 (<b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>file</b> at Mentrik Biotech). A variable region with increased binding activity for CD20 was selected and developed as AME-133v (<b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>file</b> at Mentrik Biotech). AME-133v was purchased by Eli Lilly, received the name LY2469298, and a Phase I/II clinical trial in follicular lymphoma was conducted in the U.S. {{as well as a}} Phase I clinical trial in rheumatoid arthritis initiated in the U.S. (data shown below). A Phase I clinical trial in follicular lymphoma was also conducted in Japan. AME-133v was purchased by Mentrik, Biotech in 2011 and received the generic name ocaratuzumab from the United States Adopted Name Council in December 2011.|$|E
