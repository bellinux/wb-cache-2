40|$|With {{increasing}} {{signs of}} climate change {{and the influence of}} national and international carbon-related laws and agreements, governments {{all over the world are}} grappling with how to rapidly transition to low-carbon living. This includes adapting to the impacts {{of climate change}} that are very likely to be experienced due to current emission levels (including extreme weather and sea level changes), and mitigating against further growth in greenhouse gas emissions that are likely to result in further impacts. Internationally, the concept of ‘Biophilic Urbanism’, a term coined by Professors Tim Beatley and Peter Newman to refer to the use of natural elements as design features in urban landscapes, is emerging as a key component in addressing such climate change challenges in rapidly growing urban contexts. However, the economics of incorporating such options is not well understood and requires further attention to underpin a mainstreaming of biophilic urbanism. Indeed, there appears to be an ad hoc, reactionary approach to creating economic arguments for or against the design, installation or maintenance of natural elements such as green walls, green roofs, streetscapes, and parklands. With this issue in mind, this paper will overview research as part of an industry collaborative research project that considers the potential for using a number of <b>environmental</b> <b>economic</b> <b>valuation</b> techniques that have evolved over the last several decades in agricultural and resource economics, to systematically value the economic value of biophilic elements in the urban context. Considering existing literature on <b>environmental</b> <b>economic</b> <b>valuation</b> techniques, the paper highlights opportunities for creating a standardised language for valuing biophilic elements.

40|$|Shirakami Mountain Range has {{the largest}} primeval forest in the world, and has some public functions; the {{biodiversity}} function, the water resource cultivation function, the health and recreation function and so on. This study tries to measure its environmental economic value by using the travel cost method (TCM) and the contingent valuation method (CVM). The TCM and the CVM are well-known as the typical technique of <b>environmental</b> <b>economic</b> <b>valuation.</b> The TCM can measure only the direct and current use value of environmental goods, but the CVM can measure the whole value including the non-use value of them. In the practice of <b>environmental</b> <b>economic</b> <b>valuation,</b> it is often adopted that the use value {{is measured by the}} TCM and that the non-use or the whole values are measured by CVM. However, there is no statistical significance in the difference between those values measured by the TCM and the CVM, because these methods are modeled independently and have no theoretical consistency. In this study, we have constructed a valuation model based on the CVM consistent with the TCM, in order to measure the use and the non-use values of environmental goods consistently. By applying this model to measurement of environmental economic value of Shirakami Mountain Range, practicality of the method is also examined. The result indicated that the willingness to pay (WTP) for the environmental preservation of Shirakami Mountain Range was estimated as 6, 679 JPY/person/year by using the CVM which had no consistency with the TCM, but it was estimated as 1, 028 JPY/person/year by using our model based on the CVM consistent with the TCM. Now, 6, 679 JPY/person/year means its whole value, but 1, 028 JPY/person/year means its non-use value. On the other hand, by using the TCM, the consumer surplus (CS) was estimated as 11, 154 JPY/person/year in the local area of Shirakami Mountain Range and 5, 579 JPY/person/year in Tokyo. Here, these values mean the use value of Shirakami Mountain Range. That is to say, the whole value was estimated as lower than the use value by using the CVM which had no consistency with the TCM.

40|$|Welfare is maximised in {{competitive}} markets if all costs of production are accounted for. When environmental impacts are unaccounted, the marketplace fails {{to consider the}} full costs of products and services in decision making. This market failure is arguably at the source {{of many of the}} environmental problems we face today. Full cost pricing seeks to remove market failures by determining a price that includes all costs. Through the inclusion of environmental and other social costs into the price of goods and services, a market-based mechanism for sustainable patterns of production and consumption is provided. In recent years there has been a trend towards improved pricing of environmental assets and burdens. In this paper, a systematic approach to environmental pricing is offered using the method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and techniques in <b>Environmental</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Valuation</b> to establish an economic indicator of environmental performance.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to quantitatively understand the economic performance of protected area management strategies for forest and biodiversity conservation. Examples such as integrated conservation and development and eco tourism are assessed {{in terms of their}} ability to deliver on welfare benefits to local communities, and an assessment of the opportunity costs of forest conservation as a land use strategy. In addition the contribution of forest conservation in protected areas can make to poverty alleviation and economic development is also examined. The geographical focus of this study is the Albertine Rift region of East and Central Africa, stretching north from the southern end of Lake Tanganyika through the spine of Africa to the northern end of Lake Albert. The Albertine Rift is one of Africa’s most important landscapes for the conservation of forests and biodiversity. The overarching objective is addressed using a series of case studies empirically valuing the opportunity costs of conserving forests in a selection of sites in {{the central part of the}} Albertine Rift. The success of conservation is most often measured against progress in reducing habitat or species loss and not often in terms of the contribution of the protected area to poverty alleviation and local economic development. Achieving improvements of conservation strategies in the social dimension requires objective evidence on their effects. Economic valuation of protected area resources provides a quantitative means of assessing the promise and performance of conservation policies in achieving welfare benefits to local communities. This thesis provides three case studies each addressing current valuation and social issues in conservation and sets them in a context of managing protected areas in the broad dynamic setting of poverty alleviation and economic growth from a developing economy perspective. In addition two of the empirical studies are as concerned with methodological enquiry and the performance of novel <b>environmental</b> <b>economic</b> <b>valuation</b> techniques, such as the contingent valuation and choice modelling approaches, as the application of results to conservation questions. The empirical studies show that the benefits to local households and communities from their local forests may be greater than at first perceived. Across all protected area categories, biomes and income groups, households derived significant amounts of their overall income from their local protected area with large proportions of the value of goods harvested from forests being consumed in the home. Amongst income groups high income households often appropriated a greater share of the value of forest goods. There was no significant difference found between the household consumption and the sale of protected area products between income groups. The findings indicate that imposing reductions in forest use may increase poverty amongst local people whilst increasing household income will not necessarily reduce forest exploitation. This indicates that community conservation and integrated conservation and development programmes must target the poor forest adjacent households more actively to ensure poverty alleviation, whilst providing improved protection and law enforcement for effective conservation. It is also shown that biodiversity conservation can have an economic return through mountain gorilla eco-tourism. Findings show a disparity between what constitutes eco-tourism and the real values of tourists towards biodiversity conservation and local social benefits from protected areas. Despite showing a high marginal utility for biodiversity conservation, consumers are unwilling to pay for local community benefits from tourism as part of the permit price to view gorillas. Clearly the link between successful conservation and the welfare status of local communities is not sufficiently established in the minds of consumers to influence their spending decisions. The challenges of effectively mobilising communities to protect biodiversity are discussed in the context of the variable impacts of integrated conservation and development programs over the last three decades. Direct payment payments for conservation services schemes are discussed as an innovative tool to add to the gamut of community approaches currently on offer. Payments for conservation schemes are viewed with cautious optimism in terms of their possibility for success. Despite their allure of being more economically and socially efficient at achieving welfare and conservation objectives, given the complex nature of any society, no less research in to social and economic dynamics of protected area use by local communities would be needed to ensure success of such schemes. However, the overwhelming majority of benefits form protected areas are tied up in ecosystem services values. Mechanisms to generate funding and distribute payments for these benefits in terms of offsetting the local opportunity costs are essential to change local behavior and reduce forest degradation and destruction.

40|$|Abstract: Payments for {{ecosystem}} service (PES) schemes have {{spread all over}} developing countries in the last 20 years or so. PES schemes often have high opportunity costs in terms of foregone uses {{of goods and services}} offered by the environment. It is within this scope that <b>economic</b> evaluation of <b>environmental</b> goods and services plays a role. In this paper we surveyed articles and studies that report application of <b>economic</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>valuation</b> procedures in PES schemes. Special attention was paid to data collection and analysis, to theoretical robustness of its procedures and to the aggregation of estimated value. We also scrutinize how these estimates had been incorporated into PES schemes, in particularly in the assessment phase of these schemes. Empirical data from Brazil and other Latin American countries were used, particularly those in the Amazon Basis. Our results reveal a frequent overestimation of the values of {{ecosystem service}}s calculated through the use of <b>economic</b> <b>valuation</b> methods. Values have been estimated by production function methods (opportunity cost, preventive expenditures, recovering cost or dose-response methods). As a consequence, estimated values reflect much more willingness to accept compensation by supplier and rarely willingness to pay by consumer of these ecosystem services. Besides this distance between supply and demand, application of valuation methods did not account for problems such as uncertainty, risks, and lack of information. All these limitations have led to wrong decision-making...|$|R
