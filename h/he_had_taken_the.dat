5|$|Roy faced {{challenges}} {{before entering}} college. His parents {{and his older}} brother had not attended college, and due to a learning disability Roy had difficulty with the SAT; his reading comprehension was slow, which increased the time he needed for tests. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> test four times (with tutors) before finally meeting the NCAA requirements. Unsure whether {{he would be able to}} attend a four-year college, Roy worked on the Seattle docks, cleaning shipping containers for $11/hour.|$|E
5|$|The {{belief of}} many {{followers}} that their founder was {{the incarnation of}} the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from his followers and dressed and traveled as a Maharaja even though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> vows of renunciation of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.|$|E
5|$|The {{first meeting}} of local {{commercial}} and political interests to establish a bridge across Skarnsund was held in 1972. By 1983, it was formalized by {{the establishment of the}} company ASSkarnsundsbrua to finance construction. The Parliament of Norway passed the plans in 1986, and construction started two years later. The bridge cost NOK200 million, and was opened by King Harald V on 19 December 1991, after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> last ferry across the fjord.|$|E

5|$|During {{the hearing}} into the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt {{testified that he}} offered the US$3,600 in Wells Fargo reward money ($1,200 per robber) to Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury in return for {{information}} about the identities of the three robbers. Wyatt testified that he had other motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt told the court that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{said that}} {{the day of the}} fire, about a month after Farrar's last release from the hospital, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> day off from work—the first day of what he {{intended}} to be a week-long vacation to recover some strength after restarting his job post-hospital. He had spent the afternoon with Margaret Hacker and then picked up Tim and Kelly for Tim's hockey game. After dropping the children back off with their mother at about 8:45, he had dinner with Hacker, leaving her around 11:15 in the evening.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{returned}} from the Antarctic having narrowly failed to reach the Pole, and this gave Scott the impetus to proceed with plans for his second Antarctic expedition. On 24 March 1909, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> Admiralty-based appointment of naval assistant to the Second Sea Lord which placed him conveniently in London. In December he was released on half-pay, {{to take up the}} full-time command of the British Antarctic Expedition 1910, {{to be known as the}} Terra Nova Expedition from its ship, Terra Nova.|$|E

5|$|The {{first meeting}} of local {{commercial}} and political interests to establish a bridge was made in 1972. By 1983, it was formalized by {{the establishment of the}} company ASSkarnsundsbrua to finance construction. The Parliament of Norway passed the plans in 1986, and construction started two years later. The main contractor was Aker; and after the bridge was finished, maintenance was taken over by the Nord-Trøndelag Public Roads Administration. The bridge cost NOK200 million. The bridge was opened by King Harald V on 19 December 1991, after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> last ferry across the fjord. A monument, the King's Stone, bearing the signature of the king, is located at the resting place on the Mosvik side.|$|E
5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> gun out and used it for target practice.|$|E
5|$|In June 1866 the Claimant {{moved to}} Sydney, {{where he was}} able to raise money from banks {{on the basis of a}} {{statutory}} declaration that he was Roger Tichborne. The statement was later found to contain many errors, although the birthdate and parentage details were given correctly. It included a brief account of how he had arrived in Australia: he and others from the sinking Bella, he said, had been picked up by the Osprey, bound for Melbourne. On arrival <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> name Thomas Castro from an acquaintance from Melipilla and had wandered for some years before settling in Wagga Wagga. He had married a pregnant housemaid, Mary Ann Bryant, and taken her child, a daughter, as his own; a further daughter had been born in March 1866.|$|E

5|$|Only {{weeks after}} the Darlington affair, the South Carolina Supreme Court {{declared}} the act creating the dispensary system {{in violation of the}} state constitution {{on the grounds that the}} government had no right to run a profit-making business. The vote was 2–1, with Justice Samuel McGowan in the majority. McGowan was a lame duck in office; Lieutenant Governor Gary had been elected to fill his seat effective August 1, 1894. Tillman closed the dispensaries temporarily, resulting in prohibition in South Carolina, and fired the constables. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> precaution, once the court agreed to take the dispensary case, of having the 1893 legislature pass a revised dispensary law. When Gary took the bench, the Tillmanites would have a majority on the state Supreme Court, and Tillman instructed trial justices not to hear challenges to the 1893 law until after August 1. Tillman kept the law suspended until then, afterwards reopening the dispensaries under that statute. The high court declared the 1893 act constitutional on October 8, 1894, 2–1, with Gary voting in the majority.|$|E
5|$|Saddam Hussein {{claimed that}} Aflaq had {{converted}} to Islam {{prior to his}} death – according to nameless Western diplomats. This claim was later disputed by nameless members of Aflaq's own family - although Aflaq's son Iyad confirmed that his father thought about conversion already in 1980. Upon his disputed conversion <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> first name of Ahmad. According to the German orientalists Martin Robbe and Gerhard Höpp the conversion happened before 1988. Even so, Aflaq was given an Islamic funeral. For the Berkley Center, Aflaq's disputed conversion is considered by anonymous {{members of his family}} as a tool used by Saddam Hussein to disassociate Ba'athism from Christianity. The tomb constructed on the orders of Hussein was later used by American soldiers after the 2003 American invasion of Iraq as a military barracks for troops stationed within the Green Zone.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of Rushden & Diamonds in December 2006, {{with the club}} sitting 22nd in the table, two points adrift of safety. Westley's first game in charge of Rushden was a 1–0 victory away at Cambridge United, as he set about ensuring safety. Westley secured the signatures of several players who he had previously managed at Stevenage; signing the likes of Jamie Cook, David Perpetuini, and Dino Maamria. Westley also brought in the likes of Michael Bostwick and Chris Beardsley – younger players who he had previously written about in his weekly column in The Non-League Paper {{when he was out}} of work. Westley's newly assembled team secured five straight wins in the league, including wins away at the top two teams in the league at the time, Oxford United and Dagenham & Redbridge. Despite managing an upturn {{in the form of the}} club, Westley was surprisingly sacked after a 2–2 draw at Aldershot Town in February 2007. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> club from 22nd in the league to 12th in the space of two and a half months, and the club were on a seven-match unbeaten run at the time. In all, he managed Rushden for 13 games; winning seven, drawing three and losing three. The reason behind Westley's sacking is unknown, but he was replaced two days later by Garry Hill.|$|E

25|$|Throughout 2006, rumors {{circulated}} {{regarding a}} possible Giuliani presidential campaign, abetted by hints {{from the former}} mayor himself. Over the Independence Day holiday weekend in July 2006, Giuliani declared that he would {{run for president in}} 2008 if he could raise sufficient funds. On November 13, 2006, Giuliani announced during a leadership conference in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> first step toward a potential 2008 White House bid by forming the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Exploratory Committee, Inc., allowing him to raise money for national travel and for a presidential campaign.|$|E

25|$|He toured Pakistan in 1977–78, {{playing in}} {{all three of the}} Tests, at Lahore, Hyderabad, and Karachi, and two of the One Day Internationals, at Sialkot and Lahore, missing the first ODI at Sahiwal. He almost took a hat-trick on his Test debut: he {{dismissed}} Abdul Qadir leg before wicket, then bowled Sarfraz Nawaz first ball. The next batsman, Iqbal Qasim, was caught at slip by Mike Brearley. Despite the umpire giving him out, Brearley was not sure whether <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> catch cleanly and called him back to the crease.|$|E

In a 2017 retrospective interview Häkkinen revealed {{that he had been}} in advanced talks with McLaren for a return in the 2007 season. He had however been frustrated by problems with McLaren's car in the test, which had reminded him of the reasons why <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> sabbatical in the first place, so the plans had collapsed.|$|E

Later, however, when testifying in court, Kuntar denied the charges. In his testimony, Kuntar asserted that Israeli gunfire had killed Danny Haran as soldiers burst in to free him, and that he did not see what happened to Einat after passing out from blood lost from five bullet wounds. He explained that the group's goal had been to take hostages back to Lebanon, and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> 4-year-old to prevent Israeli police from shooting at them.|$|E
