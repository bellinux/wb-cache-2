Less specifically, the move would certainly have had some degree of benefit for Galba in some way, whether indirectly, or directly, economically or financially.|$|E

Carr's book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his workings to be for his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results.|$|E

5|$|On September 22, 2011, Dugard {{filed suit}} in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip {{when he was a}} federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal {{government}} that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido {{at the time he was}} placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was good reason to hold the government liable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Full {{diversity}} signal constellations <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> transmitter antennas and <b>for</b> <b>any</b> orders which are constructed from 2 × 2 Hamiltonian matrices are investigated in this paper. The diversity {{product of a}} 2 × 2 Hamiltonian constellation equals {{one half of the}} Euclidean distance between two points in C 2. By considering the transformation from R 4 to C 2, the idea of group codes 1 is used to construct a high diversity product constellation <b>for</b> <b>any</b> order L. The (L, 4) cyclic group codes are considered to obtain L 4 -dimensional codewords for group codes. We show that our 2 × 2 Hamiltonian constellations have higher diversity product than orthogonal and diagonal constellation designs. We extend our construction to the general case <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> transmitter antennas M> 2 by using a direct sum of 2 × 2 Hamiltonian matrices for M even, and a direct sum of 2 × 2 Hamiltonian matrices with the L th roots of unity for M odd. It is shown that these constellations outperform cyclic groups and some of those obtained using fixed-point free groups. I...|$|R

Dark resigned the leasehold in 1864 and it {{was taken over by}} MCC. In 1866, using funds advanced by William Nicholson, MCC did buy the freehold from Moses for £18,333 6s 8d, which was not good business: they should have heeded James Dark.|$|E

The first bowls at a full frame and the skittles are not stuck up until all nine are hit down. Each time a player fails {{to hit a}} single pin (but they can hit as many as they like), he or she loses a life. The winner is the last one left with a life intact. Usually played for money, e.g. £1 or 50p a game each player - the winner takes the pot. Found in the Somerset and Bristol areas.|$|E
25|$|Transmissions {{normally}} involve two shift registers of some given word size, such {{as eight}} bits, {{one in the}} master {{and one in the}} slave; they are connected in a virtual ring topology. Data is usually shifted out with the most-significant bit first, while shifting a new least-significant bit into the same register. At the same time, Data from the counterpart is shifted into the least-significant bit register. After the register bits have been shifted out and in, the master and slave have exchanged register values. If more data needs to be exchanged, the shift registers are reloaded and the process repeats. Transmission may continue <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> clock cycles. When complete, the master stops toggling the clock signal, and typically deselects the slave.|$|E

25|$|The DAC {{report is}} as {{critical}} to the livelihood of a professional truck driver as the credit report is to a consumer. When a trucking company reports negative information about a truck driver, it can ruin the driver’s career by preventing him or her from finding a truck driving job for several years or more. It is widely known that trucking companies often abuse this power by willfully and maliciously reporting false information on truckers’ DAC reports, either in retaliation for seeking better paying trucking jobs elsewhere or <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> other fraudulent, anti-competitive reasons. As long as truck drivers can be threatened with a false DAC report for standing up to management or leaving their company for a better job elsewhere, working conditions at truck driver jobs will not improve.|$|E
25|$|That is, the {{partition}} of vertices among the different colors is as uniform as possible. For instance, giving each vertex a distinct color would be equitable, but would typically use many more colors than are necessary in an optimal equitable coloring. An equivalent way of defining an equitable coloring {{is that it is}} an embedding of the given graph as a subgraph of a Turán graph with the same set of vertices. There are two kinds of chromatic number associated with equitable coloring. The equitable chromatic number of a graph G is the smallest number k such that G has an equitable coloring with k colors. But G might not have equitable colorings for some larger numbers of colors; the equitable chromatic threshold of G is the smallest k such that G has equitable colorings <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> colors {{greater than or equal to}} k.|$|E
25|$|Using a {{published}} table or computer {{which gives the}} percentage of these combined resources remaining <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> overs (or, more accurately, balls) left and wickets lost, the target score can be adjusted up or down to reflect the loss of resources to one or both teams when a match is shortened one or more times. The two teams' resource percentages are found, and used to calculate a 'par score' for the second team that is usually a fractional number of runs. The target score is this number rounded up to the next integer, and the score to tie (also called the par score), is this number rounded down to the preceding integer. If the second team reaches or passes the target score, then they have won the match. If the match ends when the second team has exactly met (but not passed) the par score then the match is a tie. If the second team fail to reach the par score then they have lost.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{categorical}} data analysis, several {{regression models}} have been proposed for hierarchically-structured response variables, e. g. the nested logit model (McFadden et al., 1978). But they have been formally defined for {{only two or three}} levels in the hi-erarchy. Here, we introduce the class of partitioned conditional generalized linear models (PCGLMs) defined <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> levels. The hierarchical structure of these models is fully specified by a partition tree of categories. Using the genericity of the (r, F, Z) specification, the PCGLM can handle nominal, ordinal but also partially-ordered response variables...|$|R

500|$|Given the lax {{copyright}} {{laws of the}} time, stage plays based on Uncle Tom's Cabin—"Tom shows"—began to appear while the novel was still being serialized. Stowe refused to authorize dramatization of her work because of her distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see George L.

500|$|Fleiss' kappa is a {{generalisation}} of Scott's pi statistic, {{a statistical}} measure of inter-rater reliability. [...] It is {{also related to}} Cohen's kappa statistic and Youden's J statistic which may be more appropriate in certain instances. [...] Whereas Scott's pi and Cohen's kappa work for only two raters, Fleiss' kappa works <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> raters giving categorical ratings, to a fixed number of items.

It is important to note that whereas Cohen's kappa assumes the same two raters have rated a set of items, Fleiss' kappa specifically allows that although there are a fixed number of raters (e.g., three), different items may be rated by different individuals (Fleiss, 1971, p.378). That is, Item 1 is rated by Raters A, B, and C; but Item 2 could be rated by Raters D, E, and F.|$|E
