5000|$|There {{are three}} ports on the Slovenian coast. The traffic is mostly international. The major is the Port of Koper, built in 1957. It is a <b>feeder</b> <b>port.</b> It is about [...] closer to {{destinations}} {{east of the}} Suez than the ports of Northern Europe, and the land transport from Koper by road and by railway to the main industrial centres in Central Europe is approximately 500 km shorter than from Northern European ports. It is multimodal {{and one of the}} most modern in this part of the world, but its development is hindered by the lack of sufficient depth. From it, there are reliable and regular shipping container lines to all major world ports. The port has been rapidly growing and in 2011, more than 17 million tonnes (16,7 million long tons, 18,7 million short tons) of cargo passed through it. It is the largest Northern Adriatic port in terms of container transport. In 2011, almost 590,000 TEUs passed through it. There is a skewed balance in the direction of trade flows in the Port of Koper where import flows clearly outweigh export flows. The majority of maritime passenger traffic in Slovenia takes place in Koper, where a passenger terminal was completed in 2005. It has recorded about 100,000 passengers in 2011, and has been visited by the largest passenger ships, such as the MS Voyager of the Seas. The two smaller ports used for the international passenger transport are located in Izola and Piran. The Port of Piran is also used for the international transport of salt, whereas the Port of Izola is used for fish disembarkation. Passenger transport in Slovenia takes place mainly with Italy and Croatia. The only shipping company of Slovenia is Splošna plovba. It operates 28 ships with 1,025,000 tonnes of tonnage. It transports freight and is active only in foreign ports.|$|E

30|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{evaluating}} {{the competitiveness of}} the ports of Colombo, Singapore, Kelang, and Tanjung Pelepas, which compete for transshipment traffic in the Bay of Bengal. Although the port of Colombo is located within the East-West main sea route as the major transshipment hub port in South Asia, Southeast Asian hub ports currently develop transshipment market shares even in South Asian <b>feeder</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
30|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} characteristics and operational performances, four hub ports, namely, Colombo in South Asia and Singapore, Kelang, and Tanjung Pelepas in Southeast Asia, {{compete in the}} feeder market related to the Bay of Bengal, which is not directly served by mainline vessels in hub and spoke networks. Moreover, due to their {{close proximity to the}} East-West trunk sea route, these four hub ports compete with each other to be selected as the transshipment hub for relay networks. The consideration of two liner networks is important, as shipping lines take this aspect into account when determining the movement of containers. As an example, if one vessel has containers destined to Tuticorin <b>feeder</b> <b>port</b> as well as containers being transshipped to another mainline vessel, and if this first vessel calls at both Colombo and Singapore, the container destined to Tuticorin port would be transshipped at Colombo because of the lower feeder cost, whereas the container being transshipped to another mainline vessel would be transshipped at Singapore because the connecting mainline vessel also calls at Singapore port. We assume that these aspects create distinct roles for transshipment hubs in hub and spoke or relay networks.|$|E

The parameters studied included four conditions of primary gas flow rate and carrier gas flow rate.

Due to the one port particle injection arrangement, it was noted that particles in general sprayed with an angle deviated from the nozzle axis Zn, to {{the opposite side of the}} powder <b>feeder</b> <b>port.</b> The particles would also deviate from the spraying cone axis with a divergence angle (). The deviation and divergence angles were examined under different plasma spraying conditions. The measurement data rates at different cross-sectional planes were also obtained so as to compare the results derived from the volume flux measurement and the actual coating on a substrate at the equivalent standoff distance. It was found that the spraying area obtained from the measurement-data-rate increased with downstream distance and a linear relationship between spraying area and distance was also established. Comparing the integrated results, it was noted that the spraying areas derived from the measurement data rate were close to the actual spraying areas obtained from the coordinate measurement machine (CMM) results...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{primarily}} aims {{to examine}} the causal relationships among the integration strategies of seaport terminals along the supply chain, and the antecedents and consequences of the integration strategies. In this thesis integration strategy is termed Port Supply Chain Integration (PSCI) and the antecedents {{and the consequences of}} PSCI were identified and termed as Port Supply Chain Orientation (PSCO) and Port Performance (PP). A research model representing these causal relationships was developed through a comprehensive literature review and a semi-structured interview with practitioners and academics. The research used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to validate the constructs and rigorously test the relationships among them. Furthermore, a multi-group analysis was conducted in order to assess the applicability of the research model to different environments. The multi-group analysis tested whether the research model can be applied to two sample ports (A and B) and two sample groups (terminal operating companies and port users). The data used in these empirical analyses were collected from terminal operating companies, shipping companies and freight forwarders in South Korea, and the number of responses was 127. With regard to the results and findings of the empirical research, firstly, the three constructs, PSCO, PSCI and PP were successfully validated with the components identified from the literature review and interviews indicating that the three constructs are multi-dimensional concepts. Secondly, the empirical research showed that PSCO has a strong contribution to PSCI, and PSCI has a strong and positive impact on PP. Additionally PSCO, in turn, was found to influence positively and indirectly on PP through implementing PSCI. Finally the multi-group analysis showed that the research model can be equally applied to the two sample ports. However, the invariance test across two sample groups failed since a baseline model for the invariance test was not established. In conclusion, this thesis suggests that the integration strategy of ports along supply chains (PSCI) should be firmly based on a strong orientation to supply chain integration (PSCO) within individual seaport terminals, and the successful implementation of this strategy necessarily involves significant improvement of performance of the terminals (PP). It is also emphasised that these suggestions are valid across terminals with different operational and managerial characteristics such as hub port vs. <b>feeder</b> <b>port</b> and container port vs. non-container port...|$|E

40|$|This study {{researches}} the past, {{present and}} future role of ports, specifically the Ports of Tampa and Hamburg linked to their cities. It examines the legal structures of port authorities which {{play a major role}} in their economic priorities and impact their cities’ social, environmental and cultural quality of life. From a humanistic perspective, one can look at a port as a place or space. By animating ports, they may provide “ fields of care” over time, and a home with character for the region’s residents. In this case, their success needs to transcend economics, adding qualitative attributes to the region, such as clean air, water, good working conditions, adequate housing, public transportation, recreational provisions, public waterfront access and more. The Port of Tampa’s corporate style and largely state controlled management team prioritized diversification. As a result, the port essentially remained a <b>feeder</b> <b>port.</b> It depends on shipping phosphate (a non renewable resource), fertilizer, scrap metal, petroleum and other general cargo commodities. The port serves main (hub) and container ports which are more lucrative and environmentally less challenging. The Port of Hamburg, on the other hand, controlled by an elected local Senate, became a container hub port early on, and planned its future accordingly. Tampa’s traditional housing around the port was dissected; shopping, service and recreational areas around Tampa’s city core deteriorated, when Interstates 275, 4 and the Cross Town Expressway were constructed. Suburbs in rural areas were developed with little regard for public transportation infrastructure, recreation facilities, and pedestrian and bike paths. Most of Tampa’s waterfront, owned by its Port Authority, is leased out and fenced off to the public access. Redeveloped expensive and mostly empty downtown gentrified residences face parking garages, oil tanks, phosphate stags and scrap yards. Much of Harbor Island, close to downtown, is gated and gentrified. The Port of Hamburg, in contrast to the Port of Tampa, redeveloped an uninhabited warehouse region of its Port, named it Hafen City, thereby adding 40 percent to the core of the city. This cohesive theme is in the process of providing jobs, housing, public waterfront access, shopping, green spaces, museums a concert hall, a theater and more. Light-rail, subways trams, buses, pedestrian and bike paths link the Hafen City to the traditional city center. Hamburg’s waterfront remains open to the public by law. A comparison of both port cities shows that the Port of Tampa’s largely state controlled corporate style management team prioritizes short term economic results over an extended future planning at the expense of the region’s social, cultural and environmental climate. The Port of Hamburg’s management team, installed by the locally elected Senate, promotes the City’s economic, social, cultural and environmental quality. The above findings, suggest that developments of ports and their cities under democratically elected governments may produce various qualitative outcomes depending on the demand and supply curve of their residents’ input...|$|E

In particular, criteria such as policy and regulations and financial clearance capability must be considered by port authorities since they are strategic responsibilities. Moreover, since the availability of IT and advanced technologies indicates a lower performance, IT should be improved to enhance competitiveness.|$|R

30|$|Colombo has a {{considerably}} lower PPI for the relay case, mainly {{due to the}} absence of criteria related to the feeder segment in relay networks, because these feeder-link-related criteria generate competitive advantages for Colombo. However, the PPIs of Colombo and Singapore are significantly different even in the hub and spoke case. For instance, even though Colombo is located close to South Asian <b>feeder</b> <b>ports,</b> shipping lines may use Singapore as a hub with a higher feeder cost because it can generate lower overall network costs than when using both Singapore and Colombo. The significantly lower PPI of Tanjung Pelepas could mainly be a result of shipping lines’ perceptions of Tanjung Pelepas as a newly emerging hub port, as mentioned during interviews, and this PPI value may change in the future. The worst-performing criteria related to each hub port should be addressed to increase the PPIs of individual hub ports, and ports should focus on their high-performing criteria as competitive advantages.|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} the {{statistical}} tests in the third column of Table  10 indicate {{statistically significant differences between}} the two networks for three criteria, namely “vessel turnaround time,” “logistics facilities,” and “special preferences on shipping lines.” The high significance for vessel turnaround time in the hub and spoke case could be due to the high numbers of loading/unloading containers from the large volume of transshipments, which eventually lead to a high turnaround time. Similarly, both logistics facilities and special preferences on shipping lines could be considered more significant in the hub and spoke case, especially due to the lack of advanced value-adding facilities in <b>feeder</b> <b>ports.</b> However, considering the ranking of criteria in individual networks, criteria related to the feeder segment are prioritized in the hub and spoke case possibly due to the high feeder cost, as per interviews, and criteria related to time, deviation, and accessibility are prioritized in the relay case.|$|R
40|$|Indonesian new {{government}} (under new President from 2014 election) issues ‘Maritime-highway’ policy by developing 24 strategic ports to form mainline of national maritime transportation network (Indonesian Ministry of Development Planning, 2015). This policy aims to reduce transportation cost {{as well as}} economy (price) disparities between west and east region in Indonesia. However, as a new policy from the {{new government}}, it still needs more supporting studies to optimize maritime network between selected strategic ports for freight transportation. In addition, as a national level policy, it also needs to consider macro economy future perspective since it will be implemented {{in a long term}} period. Therefore, a comprehensive study is conducted to develop a design of Indonesia’s freight maritime network using a multi-objectives optimization model with main objectives to minimize total cost and total distance simultaneously. Literatures review and analysis of Indonesia’s freight maritime network current situation are required to identify important factors for the model implementation. An Origin-Destination (OD) demand matrix for year 2030 is generated as the main input for simulation model analysis. There are three scenarios in the model simulation. First scenario uses OD matrix based on growth factor for each province that is calculated from Growth Domestic Regional Product (GDRP) realization (until 2013) and GDRP target from Indonesian government (until 2019 and continue the 2019 target to the year 2030). In the second scenario, a more balance demand especially in east region is applied by increasing growth factor for provinces with very low GDRP value. Finally, third scenario uses more equal handling cost among ports in the network with the same OD matrix from the second scenario. Furthermore, analysis and selection of alternatives in maritime network design are performed {{based on the results of}} the model simulation for each scenario. The final result of this study shows that the recommended maritime network designs have noticeable differences compare to initial network in maritime highway policy especially in the second and the third scenario. In these scenarios, the number and composition of hub and <b>feeder</b> <b>ports</b> are significantly changed due to more balance demand between provinces and more balance ports handling cost in the third scenario.

40|$|A {{terminal}} is efficient if {{it produces}} a maximum output (container traffic in TEU) for given inputs (terminal superstructure). Traditional studies on container terminal efficiency {{tend to focus on}} partial productivity measures such as TEU per crane. These instruments do not assess the overall efficiency of terminal operations, as they only look at specific aspects of the terminal operation process. This paper presents an approach for the measurement of container terminal efficiency based on Bayesian Stochastic Frontier modelling. A Bayesian Stochastic Frontier Model is a stochastic and parametric method for analysing productive efficiency. The stochastic production function takes into account statistical noise (composed error) and models the level of inefficiency via a non-negative disturbance. As such, the level of (in) efficiency of different terminals can be compared. The model is tested using a sample of 36 European container terminals, supplemented with four Asian container ports. In general, north European container terminals attain a slightly higher degree of efficiency than southern terminals. Terminals located in hub ports on average are considered as more efficient than those in <b>feeder</b> <b>ports.</b> International Journal of Maritime Economics (2000) 2, 83 – 106; doi: 10. 1057 /ijme. 2000. 9...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{progress}} of container port system development in South China, focusing particularly on the interplay between Hong Kong and the other ports in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. After identifying the downgrading trend of Hong Kong from a transshipment hub port for Asia and for China as a whole to a regional load center {{and the emergence of}} other deepsea direct-service ports, the paper looks into the causes of this structural change of the port system. Four major causes are identified: the cost-base competition, the impact of the unique 'one-country two-systems' policy, the impact of globalization and container standardization, and the impact of multi-modal accessibility and connectivity. The paper reveals that the interplay between different governments and between the governments and port operators are the local mechanisms that together as a whole respond to the shippers' needs and the shipping lines' pressure. It confirms that the interdependencies and competitive relations between terminals are being played out at a regional level. While the particular situation of the PRD is unique in many regards, the features emerging there, with its dominant hub, its network of <b>feeder</b> <b>ports</b> and its emerging direct-service non-hub terminals, are being replicated elsewhere.

40|$|The islands {{located in}} an area of about 160. 000 sq km in {{southern}} part of Sulawesi, consist of 5 regencies. There are 5 big islands (more than 150 sq km each) in this area. The economic level of these islands is still low and, therefor, can not afford the commercial transportation tariff. Since 1974 the government of Indonesia has provided so called pioneer shipping (subsidized financially by government) in order to improve accessibility of these islands. So far, the economic level of population of these islands has not much improved. The pioneer ships are general cargo type (coaster), with long distance trips (average 1. 660 sea mile) and take about 18 days for a round trip. The determination of shipping routes for servicing less developed islands are made without any deep analysis. This paper began with analysis of selecting ports in order to improve routes of the pioneer ships. To determiny an optimum sea transportation services into the area, the shipping should be classified in regional pioneer routes (main regional feeder), secondary regional feeder, and people shipping.

A routing optimization model for multi-type containerships with time deadlines is established, and the target is to minimize the total cost, which consists of the total travelling cost, total service cost and total waiting cost. The model is set up through an improved genetic algorithm. The study data are from the Pearl River Delta region of China, which include 1 hub <b>port</b> and 29 <b>feeder</b> <b>ports</b> and have a population of 30 million. Result shows that when the iteration time reaches 190, the total cost comes to 521 thousand yuan near the optimal value. There are 6 routes, including 3 containerships of 100 TEU, 2 containerships of 150 TEU and 1 containership of 200 TEU. At the same time, in the single-type containerships case, there are 7 routes, and when the iteration time reaches 120, the total cost comes to 573 thousand yuan, which {{is close to the}} optimal value. Comparing the two cases, it shows that the model for multi-type containerships with time deadlines is reasonable, and the algorithm is practicable. In the last, three factors, which may affect the total cost to carry out sensitivity analysis are chosen. It shows that time deadline, containership capacity and cargo handling capacity of each port have significant influence on the total cost. It is also shown that the total cost for multi-type containerships is always less than that for the single-type containerships...|$|R

40|$|Competition among {{container}} ports {{continues to}} increase as the differentiation of hub <b>ports</b> and <b>feeder</b> <b>ports</b> progresses. Managers in many container terminals are trying to attract carriers by automating handling equipment, providing and speeding up various services, and furnishing the most current information on the flow of containers. At the same time, however, {{they are trying to}} reduce costs by utilizing resources efficiently, including human resources, berths, container yards, quay cranes, and various yard equipment. When planning berth usage, the berthing time and the exact position of each vessel at the wharf, as well as various quay side resources are usually determined in the process. Several variables must be considered, including the length overall (LOA) and arrival time of each vessel, the number of containers for discharging and loading, and the storage location of outbound/inbound containers to be loaded onto/discharged from the corresponding vessel. Furthermore, we aim to propose berthing plan that will be "robust", since the actual arrival time of each vessel can vary substantially from forecast. This is particular important for vessels from priority customers (called priority vessels hereon), who have been promised berth-on-arrival (i. e. within two hours of arriving) service guarantee in their contract with PSA. A robust plan will also helps to minimize the frequent updates (changes) to berthing plan that have repercussion in resource and sta deployment within the terminal. Thus, the problem reduces to one of finding a berthing plan, so that priority vessels can be berthed-on-arrival with high probability, and the vessels can be berthed as close to their preferred locations as possible, to reduce the cost of transporting the containers within the terminal.
