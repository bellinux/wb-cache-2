Perhaps the worst, but all too common, location is a Post-It note on the computer monitor. Better locations are a safe deposit box or a locked file approved for information of sensitivity comparable to that protected by the password. Most locks on office <b>file</b> <b>cabinets</b> are far from adequate. Software is available for popular hand-held computers that can store passwords for numerous accounts in encrypted form. Another approach is to encrypt by hand on paper and remember the encryption method and key. And another approach {{is to use a}} single password or slightly varying passwords for low-security accounts and select distinctly separate strong passwords for a smaller number of high-value applications such as for online banking.|$|E

The fact that man does not understand Chinese is irrelevant, because it is only the system as a whole that matters.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a self-organized <b>file</b> <b>cabinet.</b> This <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> uses electronic information {{to augment the}} physical world. By using a scanner to transform documents into electronic files, the self-organized <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> can index the documents on visual and textual information. The selforganized <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> helps the user find the documents at a later date. The focus of this thesis is on the design and evaluation of the self-organized <b>file</b> <b>cabinet.</b> User studies show that this tool is natural to use.

5000|$|Within the United States, {{the primary}} {{standard}} for vertical <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> is the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA) Standard X5.3. [...] BIFMA used {{to maintain a}} separate Standard X5.2 for lateral <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> but that standard has been withdrawn. The standards provide requirements for cabinet stability, durability, and strength, among others. The General Services Administration (GSA) also maintains standards for vertical and lateral steel <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> A-A-3186and A-A-3187respectively. The GSA standards define two grades of <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> medium- and heavy-duty. They reference the BIFMA standard for the medium-duty cabinets, and provide additional performance requirements for the heavy-duty cabinets. The GSA is also responsible for maintaining the standards for <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> and security containers for storing classified materials; more information on that subject {{may be found in}} the article on classified information in the United States.|$|R
50|$|To use {{the example}} of a {{physical}} <b>file</b> <b>cabinet,</b> if the separate drawers in the <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> are represented as the highest level of sub-directories in the file system or system prompt, then the room the <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> is in may be represented as the root directory. That is, the other directories may be inside it, but the root directory cannot go in any other directories, at least in that file system. In most operating systems, files can be placed inside the root directory, as well as in its sub-directories. One may envision this as placing paper files anywhere in the room, or into any <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> within the room.|$|R

2500|$|The Chinese {{room has}} a design {{analogous}} {{to that of}} a modern computer. It has a Von Neumann architecture, which consists of a program (the book of instructions), some memory (the papers and <b>file</b> <b>cabinets),</b> a CPU which follows the instructions (the man), and a means to write symbols in memory (the pencil and eraser). A machine with this design is known in theoretical computer science as [...] "Turing complete", because it has the necessary machinery to carry out any computation that a Turing machine can do, and therefore it is capable of doing a step-by-step simulation of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. Alan Turing writes, [...] "all digital computers are in a sense equivalent." [...] The widely accepted Church-Turing thesis holds that any function computable by an effective procedure is computable by a Turing machine.|$|E

25|$|A <b>filing</b> <b>cabinet</b> is a {{piece of}} office {{furniture}} usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple sense, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. A vertical <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15inches) of the <b>cabinet.</b> The vertical <b>filing</b> <b>cabinet</b> was invented by Edwin G. Seibels in 1898, thus revolutionizing efficient record-keeping and archiving by creating space for offices, schools, and businesses.|$|R
