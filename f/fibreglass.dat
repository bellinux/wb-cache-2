5|$|A <b>fibreglass</b> {{replica of}} a Spitfire Mk IX is mounted {{to the roof of}} the {{speciality}} shop, Spitfire Emporium, in Kitchener, Ontario.|$|E
5|$|A <b>fibreglass</b> replica in the colours of a Polish {{squadron}} leader {{based at the}} station during the Second World War is on display at RAF Northolt, the last Battle of Britain Sector Station still in RAF operational service.|$|E
5|$|A <b>fibreglass</b> {{replica of}} a Spitfire has been mounted on a pylon in Memorial Park, Hamilton, New Zealand {{as a tribute to}} all New Zealand fighter pilots who flew Spitfires during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{replicas of}} {{traditional}} composite bows are commercially available; {{they are usually}} made with <b>fibreglass</b> or carbon on both belly and back, easier to mass-produce and easier {{to take care of}} than traditional composite bows.|$|E
5|$|A <b>fibreglass</b> {{replica of}} a Mk XVI {{spitfire}} sits on a pylon next to Memorial Avenue at Christchurch Airport, New Zealand. It was moved to its current location in 2015 from the previous position {{at the entrance to}} the airport where it had been for 50 years. The replica was apparently used as a static display in Reach for the Sky.|$|E
5|$|A <b>fibreglass</b> {{replica of}} a Spitfire Mk IX has been mounted on a pylon in Jackson Park, Windsor, Ontario {{alongside}} a Hurricane as a memorial to Royal Canadian Air Force pilots. This display replaces an Avro Lancaster bomber {{that had previously been}} on display and is currently undergoing restoration.|$|E
5|$|A <b>fibreglass</b> {{replica of}} the Mk.1 Spitfire Mk1 YT-J (R6675), flown by Supermarine test pilot Jeffrey Quill during his brief period of active service with 65 Squadron, is {{on display at the}} Battle of Britain {{memorial}} at Capel-le-Ferne near Folkestone, along with a replica Mk.1 Hurricane representing US-X, in which Pilot Officer Geoffrey Page was shot down on 12 August 1940.|$|E
5|$|At Bentley Priory, the Second World War command centre for Fighter Command, <b>fibreglass</b> {{replicas of}} a Spitfire Mk 1 and a Hurricane Mk 1 {{can be seen}} fixed in a {{position}} of attack. This was built as a memorial to everyone who worked at Bentley Priory during the war.|$|E
5|$|Patriot {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and <b>fibreglass</b> train which were manufactured in Switzerland before being shipped to Kansas City. Each train has seven cars that can seat four riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 28 riders per train. The train structure is colored blue, yellow, and white and the seats and over-the-shoulder restraints are both red.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the Battle of Britain Bunker, {{including}} the No. 11 Group memorial, will retain the RAF Uxbridge name and be maintained by RAF Northolt as an exclave. The Royal Air Force Ensign {{was moved to the}} area, together with the Supermarine Spitfire gate guardian, a <b>fibreglass</b> replica of aircraft BR600. The Spitfire was refurbished and painted in the D-Day invasion colours of No. 33 Squadron as aircraft BS239, funded by the London Borough of Hillingdon. Uxbridge's first gate guardian was a real Supermarine Spitfire which was unveiled on 23 May 1973. This was sold to a collector for restoration and replaced by the current guardian in 1988. At a service commemorating the Battle of Britain in September 2010, a new Hawker Hurricane gate guardian in the markings of No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron was unveiled, also near the bunker. The guardian is a <b>fibreglass</b> replica of the aircraft flown by Witold Urbanowicz during the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception. The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the work of young people, noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of <b>fibreglass.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{the display}} was totally renovated. The {{destroyed}} limestone cliff was completely replaced using 130 large blocks of Derbyshire limestone, many weighing over , rebuilt {{according to a}} small model made from {{the same number of}} polystyrene blocks. <b>Fibreglass</b> replacements were created for the missing sculptures, and badly damaged parts of the surviving models were recast. For example, some of the animals' legs had been modelled in lead, fixed to the bodies with iron rods; the iron had rusted, splitting the lead open.|$|E
5|$|In November 1982, Bahrain {{became the}} first customer. South Korea also {{explored}} local production of the F-20, and in support improvements were implemented. These included avionics upgrades, an expanded fuel tank, {{and the use of}} <b>fibreglass</b> composites. The changes were so extensive that a fourth prototype was built to test them. By 1983, Northrop was involved in a number of simultaneous negotiations for the F-20, and its prospects appeared positive.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} educate people about extinct forms of life, the Geological Survey of India {{installed}} lifesize <b>fibreglass</b> models of Rajasaurus and Titanosaurus at their Lucknow regional office. The installation is presented in an appropriate setting, with representations of plants that existed during the Mesozoic Era. Also displayed are limb bones, vertebra, eggs and coprolites of sauropod dinosaurs and fossil eggs of Rajasaurus collected from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|Northolt {{received}} its first gate guardian, a Spitfire F.Mk 22, in September 1963. Purchased from the RAF in 1969 {{for use in}} the film Battle of Britain, it was replaced by a Spitfire Mk XVI on 2 June 1970. This aircraft remained at the station until its removal on 8 September 1989 for restoration to full flying condition. The Kermit Weeks' Fantasy of Flight Museum in Polk City, Florida, purchased the aircraft whereupon the station received a <b>fibreglass</b> replica of a Spitfire Mk IX as a replacement.|$|E
5|$|The Woolwich Rotunda Artillery Museum and the States of Jersey lent {{examples}} of Warriors original primary guns, the muzzle-loading 68-pounder and the breech-loading 110-pounder, which {{were used as}} moulds for <b>fibreglass</b> replicas. The Armstrong guns were built with working breeches; they, and the muzzles of all the guns, had to be sealed to prevent people leaving rubbish in them. Little information was available on the wooden gun carriages despite extensive research, and a prototype had to be developed and tested before they could be built.|$|E
5|$|The film {{features}} catapults resembling windmills, {{that can}} fire rapidly, and a ballista that can fire three projectiles at a time. The practical versions {{of these were}} metal with <b>fibreglass</b> painted and aged to resemble wood on top. Weta created props of the missiles thrown by the Telmarine equipment. The practical version of the catapult had its upper half painted blue, to composite a digital version programmed for rapid firing movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{head and}} hands are {{coloured}} using {{a blend of}} oil, water and acrylic colour. From the mould, the body is cast in <b>fibreglass,</b> and the head and hands are fitted to the fiberglass body and dressed in clothes that are often donated by the celebrity. The pose, clothes and expression on the face all contribute to making the figure as realistic as possible. The whole process usually takes {{up to six months}} by a team of 20 people to create and cost about HK$1 million each.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1970s, foreign work (such as the Bosporus Bridge in Turkey, {{completed}} 1974) was accelerating while domestic {{orders were}} receding, {{according to the}} company's annual report of 1975. By 1980, foreign work {{accounted for more than}} 50% of Hochtief's business. A major factor was the contract for King Abdulaziz International Airport (completed 1981), the largest airport in Saudi Arabia, and the most valuable contract Hochtief had ever been involved with. The architecture of the airport is highly rated aesthetically, and it has several unusual features, including Terminal Three, used only during the Hajj, reserved for pilgrims travelling to Mecca. It has a tent-shaped <b>fibreglass</b> roof, contains a mosque, can accommodate 80,000 travellers at once, and {{is believed to be the}} largest terminal in the world.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the main}} puppet cast to feature in the film, such as Scott Tracy, were re-made from the {{original}} marionettes, while previously unseen characters such as the Zero-X astronauts, Cliff Richard and the bandmembers of The Shadows were sculpted especially. Whereas guest star puppets for Series One had been recycled for each appearance and moulded in Plasticine, since {{this was the first}} occasion when puppets in an AP Films production were intended to represent real-life celebrities, most of the supporting puppets were made from <b>fibreglass</b> to the same standards of workmanship as the main puppets.|$|E
5|$|The modern event sees athletes {{run down}} {{a strip of}} track, plant the pole in the metal box, and vault over the {{horizontal}} bar before {{letting go of the}} pole and falling backwards onto the landing mattress. While earlier versions used wooden, metal or bamboo, modern poles are generally made from artificial materials such as <b>fibreglass</b> or carbon fibre. The pole vault has been an Olympic event since 1896 for men, but it was over 100 years later that the first women's world championship competition was held at the 1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships. The first women's Olympic pole vaulting competition occurred in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are usually {{based on a}} dump truck chassis, which are then converted into winter {{service vehicles}} either by the manufacturer or an aftermarket third-party. A typical modification involves the replacement of steel components of the vehicle with corrosion resistant aluminium or <b>fibreglass,</b> waterproofing any exposed electronic components, replacement of the stock hopper with a specially designed gritting body, {{the addition of a}} plow frame, reinforcement of the wheels, bumpers to support the heavy blade, and the addition of extra headlamps, a light bar, and retroreflectors for visibility.|$|E
5|$|Major repairs {{were carried}} out to the spire in 1946–47 under the {{supervision}} of architect Kenneth Dalgleish, following damage sustained during the Second World War. In 1957, the bells were again repaired. On 25 August 1959, the church was added to the register of listed buildings. It is Grade I listed. The clock was repaired in 1972 in memory of George Prentice, rector of Mereworth from 1966–70. A new <b>fibreglass</b> clock face was fitted at this time and the winding mechanism converted to electric power. In 2005, an inspection revealed that the church needed major repairs. English Heritage made a grant that covered 95% of the £500,000 cost of restoration. The work was carried out {{under the supervision of}} architects Thomas Ford & Partners, and won the 2009 Georgian Group award for best restoration of a Georgian church.|$|E
5|$|In June 1968, Plante {{was drafted}} by the St. Louis Blues and signed for $35,000 for the 1968–69 season. In his first season with the Blues, Plante split the goaltending duties with Glenn Hall. He won the Vezina Trophy that season for the seventh time, surpassing Bill Durnan's record. While playing for the Blues in the 1969–70 playoffs against the Boston Bruins, a shot fired by Fred Stanfield and {{redirected}} by Phil Esposito hit Plante in the forehead, knocking him out and breaking his <b>fibreglass</b> mask. The first thing Plante said after he regained consciousness at the hospital was that the mask saved his life. That game proved to be his last for the Blues, and he was traded {{in the summer of}} 1970 to the Toronto Maple Leafs. He led the NHL with the lowest goals against average (GAA) during his first season with the Maple Leafs. At season's end, he was named to the NHL's second All-Star team, his seventh such honour. He continued to play for the Leafs until he was traded to the Boston Bruins late in the 1972–73 season, recording a shutout against the Black Hawks in his debut for the Bruins. He played eight regular season and two playoff games for the Bruins to finish that season, his last in the NHL.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} programme {{moved to the}} University of Exeter in 1982, where the C1 chassis was fitted with <b>fibreglass</b> shells and tested in a wind tunnel. It was recognised {{at an early stage}} that the vehicle would have to be aerodynamic; although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow, reducing wind resistance was seen as essential for the vehicle's efficiency. By March 1982 the basic design of the C1 had been established. Sinclair then turned to an established motor design company, Ogle Design of Letchworth, to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering. However, Ogle's approach was not to Sinclair's liking; they tackled the project as one of car design and focused more (and expensively) on the aerodynamics rather than the cycle technology around which the C1 was based. The weight of the vehicle increased to over , far more than Sinclair's desired specification. By March 1983, Sinclair and Wood Rogers had decided to stop the C1 programme. Wood Rogers comments that Ogle were convinced that the C1 would be a flop, telling Sinclair {{that it would not be}} fast enough, that its drivers would get wet when it rained and that the battery was not good enough.|$|E
25|$|By January 1953, some {{cars were}} being fitted with <b>fibreglass</b> rear wings. Bonnets in <b>fibreglass</b> {{followed}} soon after, {{but these were}} not used on production vehicles until December 1954. The production cost of the <b>fibreglass</b> parts {{was about the same}} as those of aluminium, but the parts were said to be both lighter and stronger.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} is a 4130 {{welded steel}} tube cage {{covered in a}} non-structural <b>fibreglass</b> skin. The tail group {{is a mix of}} <b>fibreglass</b> fairings and aluminum surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Amphibious {{model with}} <b>fibreglass</b> boat hull, in {{production}} in 2013.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} inscription {{is kept in}} the Office of the Director of Archaeology and Museums, Govt. of Karnataka, Mysore, and a <b>fibreglass</b> replica {{has been}} installed in Halmidi. A mantapa to house a <b>fibreglass</b> replica of the original inscription has been built at Hamidi village. The Government has begun to promote the village {{as a place of}} historical interest.|$|E
25|$|The spinner may be {{constructed}} from aluminium or <b>fibreglass.</b> Often softer grades of aluminium {{are used to}} reduce the tendency to crack in service. Early <b>fibreglass</b> spinners introduced as kits for the homebuilt aircraft market in the early 1990s initially developed a poor reputation for cracking. More recent models have resolved these problems and they now function as well as aluminium ones do.|$|E
25|$|Production of the Mark G {{began in}} August 1961 and {{initially}} the Bond 250 G Minicar {{was the only}} version available. The new style roof offered several inches more headroom and incorporated a backward-slanted rear window of the type popularised in the UK by the Ford Anglia. This was initially mirrored by nominal <b>fibreglass</b> tailfins inserted into the aluminium rear wings before the wings became entirely made from <b>fibreglass.</b>|$|E
25|$|Winchester Model 70s {{customized}} with custom barrels, <b>fibreglass</b> stock, custom scope {{base and}} a Leupold Vari – x3 Police scope.|$|E
25|$|The SZD-45 Ogar (Greyhound) is a T-tailed {{cantilever}} high-wing monoplane of wooden, aluminium and <b>fibreglass</b> construction {{designed and}} manufactured in Poland.|$|E
25|$|A stick, {{made of wood}} or <b>fibreglass,</b> {{tapering}} to a tip, usually {{ending in}} leather, {{which is used to}} strike the cue-ball.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Ferretti began {{operating}} in the segment of yachts with <b>fibreglass</b> flybridges, measuring 28 to 40 metres in length, through Custom Line S.p.A.|$|E
