40|$|What is a mound system? A {{septic tank}} mound {{system is a}} {{technology}} used for treating and disposing of domestic wastewater in areas unsuitable for conventional septic tank soil absorption systems. Mounds are pressure-dosed sand filters placed above, and discharging directly to, the natural soil. Their main purpose is to provide additional treatment to the wastewater before it enters the natural environment. Mound systems are designed to overcome site restrictions such as: • slow or fast permeability soils, • shallow soil cover over creviced or porous bedrock, and • a high water table. The three components of a mound system are a pretreatment unit(s), <b>dosing</b> <b>chamber,</b> and the elevated mound. See Figure 1 on page 2 for an illustration. The pretreatment unit is usually a septic tank, which removes solids from the wastewater. The <b>dosing</b> <b>chamber</b> follows the septic tank and contains a pump, which uses pressure to evenly distribute the wastewater over the infiltration surface of the mound. The mound {{is made up of}} a soil cover that can support vegetation and a fabriccovered coarse gravel aggregate in which a network of small diameter perforated pipe is placed. The network of perforated pipe is designed to distribute the effluent evenly through the gravel from where it trickles down to the sand media and hence, into the plowed basal area (natural soil). Treatment occurs through physical, biological, and chemical means as the wastewater filters down through the sand and the natural soil. What are {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using mound systems? Advantages • The mound system enables use of land that would otherwise be unsuitable for inground or at-grade onsite systems. • The natural soil utilized in a mound system is usually the top layer, which is typically the most permeable.

The severity and progression of the resulting skin lesions were quantified daily for three weeks post-exposure using biophysical measurements of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin reflectance spectroscopy (SRS).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to clarify whether the assumption was valid when translated to a biological system (pig skin) using sulfur mustard (SM) as a model skin penetrant. Three systems were evaluated, two containing skin and a control system (without skin). At set time points, samples from the headspace of each dosing system were extracted using a gas-tight syringe and analyzed by gas chromatography in conjunction with a flame-ionization detector. This demonstrated the rapid achievement of a constant vapor concentration within the biological and control systems and enabled a comparison with previously determined SVCs attained under ideal conditions. All three systems attained a constant vapor concentration within 2 rain of exposure to SM. The control system reached an equilibrium vapor concentration of 1179 ?? 164 mg/m 3, a value not significantly different from that derived from the SVC (1363 mg/m 3).

40|$|What is a {{low-pressure}} pipe system? A {{low-pressure pipe}} (LPP) {{system is a}} shallow, pressure-dosed soil absorption system with a network of small diameter perforated pipes placed in narrow trenches. Originating in North Carolina and Wisconsin, LPP systems were developed {{as an alternative to}} conventional soil absorption systems to eliminate problems such as: clogging of the soil from localized overloading, mechanical sealing of the soil trench during construction, anaerobic conditions due to continuous saturation, and a high water table. The LPP system has the following design features that overcome these problems: 1) shallow placement, 2) narrow trenches, 3) continuous trenching, 4) pressure-dosed with uniform distribution of the effluent, 5) design based on areal loading, and 6) resting and reaeration between doses. The main components of an LPP system are: • a septic tank or an aerobic unit; • pumping (<b>dosing)</b> <b>chamber</b> (submersible effluent pump, level controls, high water alarm, and supply manifold); and • small diameter distribution laterals with small perforations (holes). The septic tank is where settleable and floatable solids are removed and primary treatment occurs. Partially clarified effluent then flows by gravity to a pumping chamber where it is stored until it reaches the level of A General Overview the upper float control, which turns the pump on. The level controls are set for a specific pumping sequence of one to two times daily, allowing breaks in between doses for the soil to absorb the wastewater. However, the dosing mechanisms and frequency may vary for different systems. The pump moves the effluent through the supply line and manifold to the distribution laterals under low pressure. The laterals are a network of PVC pipes that have small, drilled holes through which the wastewater is distributed evenly. Th...|$|E

Longitudinal studies of humans and animals are easily accomplished, {{taking advantage of the}} fact that MRI does not use harmful radiation that would be needed for plain film radiographic, computerized tomography (CT) or positron emission (PET) scans. Routine anatomic and functional studies using the strong signal from the most abundant magnetic nucleus, the proton, can also provide metabolic information when combined with in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). MRS can be performed using either protons or hetero-nuclei (meaning any magnetic nuclei other than protons or 1 H) including carbon (13 C) or phosphorus (31 P). In vivo MR spectra can be obtained from single region of interest (ROI or voxel) or multiple ROIs simultaneously using the technique typically called chemical shift imaging (CSI). Here we report applications of CSI to marine samples and describe a technique to study in vivo glycine metabolism in oysters using 13 C MRS 12 h after immersion in a sea water <b>chamber</b> <b>dosed</b> with [2 - 13 C]-glycine. This is the first report of 13 C CSI in a marine organism. Mar. Drugs 2010, 8 237...|$|R
40|$|External beam {{radiotherapy}} (EBRT) for {{carcinoma of}} uterine cervix {{is a basic}} line of treatment with three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3 DCRT) in large number of patients. There is need for an established method for verification dosimetry. We tried to document absorbed doses {{in a group of}} carcinoma cervix patients by inserting a 0. 6 cc Farmer type ion chamber in the vaginal cavity. A special long perspex sleeve cap is designed to cover the chamber for using in the patient′s body. Response of ionization chamber is checked earlier in water phantom with and without cap. Treatment planning was carried out with X-ray computed tomography (CT) scan and with the chamber along with cap in inserted position, and with the images Xio treatment planning system. Three measurements on 3 days at 5 - 6 fraction intervals were recorded in 12 patients. Electrometer measured charges are converted to absorbed <b>dose</b> at the <b>chamber</b> center, in vivo. Our results show good agreement with planned dose within 3 % against prescribed dose. This study, is a refinement over our previous studies with transmission dosimetry and chemicals in ampules. This preliminary work shows promise that this can be followed as a routine dose check with special relevance to new protocols in the treatment of carcinoma cervix with EBRT...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of the water calorimeter direct measurement of absorbed dose in water becomes possible. This could lead to the establishment of an absorbed dose rather than an exposure related standard for ionization chambers for high energy electrons and photons. In changing to an absorbed dose standard it is necessary to investigate the effect of different parameters, among which are the energy dependence, the air volume, wall thickness and material of the chamber. The effect of these parameters is experimentally studied and presented for several commercially available chambers and one experimental chamber, for photons up to 25 MV and electrons up to 20 MeV, using a water calorimeter as the absorbed dose standard and the most recent formalism to calculate the absorbed <b>dose</b> with ion <b>chambers.</b> ^ For electron beams, the dose measured with the calorimeter was 1 % lower than the dose calculated with the chambers, independent of beam energy and chamber. ^ For photon beams, the absorbed dose measured with the calorimeter was 3. 8 % higher than the absorbed dose calculated from the chamber readings. Such differences were found to be chamber and energy independent. ^ The results for the photons were found to be statistically different from the results with the electron beams. Such difference could not be attributed to a difference in the calorimeter response. ...|$|R
40|$|Well-type {{ionization}} chamber {{is often used}} to measure strength of brachytherapy sources. This study aims to check long term response stability of High Dose Rate (HDR) - 1000 Plus well-type {{ionization chamber}} in terms of reference air kerma rate (RAKR) of a reference 137 Cs brachytherapy source and recommend an optimum frequency of recalibration. An HDR- 1000 Plus well-type ionization chamber, a reference 137 Cs brachytherapy source (CDCSJ 5), and a MAX- 4000 electrometer were used in this study. The HDR- 1000 Plus well-type chamber was calibrated in terms of reference air kerma rate by the Standards Laboratory of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Vienna. The response of the chamber was verified at regular intervals over a period of eight years using the reference 137 Cs source. All required correction factors were applied in the calculation of the RAKR of the 137 Cs source. This study reveals that the response of the HDR- 1000 Plus well-type chamber was well within &# 177; 0. 5 &#x 0025; for about three years after calibration/recalibration. However, it shows deviations larger than &# 177; 0. 5 &#x 0025; after three years of calibration/recalibration and the maximum variation in response of the chamber during an eight year period was 1. 71 &#x 0025;. The optimum frequency of recalibration of a high <b>dose</b> rate well-type <b>chamber</b> should be three years...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{increased}} interest in an 8 -h ozone (OJ) federal air quality standard, acute pulmonary function responses to prolonged square-wave OJ exposure between 0. 08 and 0. 12 ppm have been examined in several U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chamber studies. A low-cost face-mask OJ exposure system was developed in this labo-ratory and found to produce closely similar pulmonary responses to those observed in prolonged exposures by U. S. EPA investigators. The {{primary purpose of the}} present study was to investigate the pulmonary function and subjective symptoms effects of 6. 6 -h square-wave exposure to 0. 12 ppm OJ by these two methods using the same group of subjects. In addition, further investigation of pulmonary function and symptoms responses upon 6. 6 -h exposures to lower levels of OJ (0. 04 - 0. 08 ppm) were studied with the face-mask inhalation system. Thirty young adult subjects completed five 6. 6 -h exposures with six 50 -min periods of exercise at an intensity requiring a minute ventilation rate (V E) of- 20 Uminlm 2 of body surface area, each followed by 10 min of rest, except fol/ow-ing 3 h when the rest period was lengthened for a lunch break.
