5|$|Cannon: The {{earliest}} known {{depiction of}} a cannon is a sculpture from the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan dated to 1128, however the earliest archaeological samples and textual accounts do not appear until the 13th century. The primary extant specimens of cannon from the 13th century are the Wuwei Bronze Cannon dated to 1227, the Heilongjiang hand cannon dated to 1288, and the Xanadu Gun dated to 1298. However, only the Xanadu gun contains an inscription bearing a <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> so it is considered the earliest confirmed extant cannon. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7cm in length and weighs 6.2kg. The other cannon are dated using contextual evidence.|$|E

These are classified by technique, countries of origin and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> The collections are well represented in these areas: early silks from the Near East, lace, European tapestries and English medieval church embroidery.|$|E

500|$|On June 20, 1899, Barber {{submitted}} the final {{designs for the}} coin. [...] They were approved by Director Roberts on July 1. This did not {{put an end to}} the wrangles over what should be on the coin: the commission wished to have the coins dated 1900, but have them to sell as early as possible in 1899. [...] Secretary of the Treasury Lyman Gage insisted on the provision of the Coinage Act of 1873 that required the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> to appear on the coins. [...] In the end, the matter was compromised: the pieces were struck in December 1899, not distributed until the following month, and the inscription [...] "Paris 1900" [...] appears on the coins.|$|E
500|$|The cannon {{appeared}} in China during the 12th century, probably as a {{development of the}} fire-lance, a short ranged weapon combining a gunpowder-filled tube and a polearm of some kind. Co-viative projectiles such as iron scraps or porcelain shards were placed in fire lance barrels at some point, and eventually, the paper and bamboo materials of fire lance barrels were replaced replaced by metal. The earliest known depiction of a cannon is a sculpture from the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan, dated to 1128, that portrays a figure carrying a vase-shaped bombard, firing flames and a cannonball. The oldest surviving gun bearing a <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is the Xanadu gun, dated to 1298. Other specimens have been dated to even earlier periods, such as the Heilongjiang hand cannon, to 1288, and the Wuwei gun, to 1227. However they contain no inscriptions.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{depiction of}} cannon appeared in Song dynasty China {{as early as}} the 12th century, however solid archaeological and documentary evidence of cannon do not appear until the 13th century. In 1288 Yuan dynasty troops are recorded to have used hand cannons in combat, and the earliest extant cannon bearing a <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> comes from the same period. Evidence of cannon next appeared in Europe. By 1326 depictions of cannon had also appeared in Europe and almost immediately recorded usage of cannon began appearing. By the end of the 14th century cannon were widespread throughout Eurasia. Cannon were used primarily as anti-infantry weapons until around 1374 when cannon were recorded to have breached walls {{for the first time in}} Europe. Cannon featured prominently as siege weapons and ever larger pieces appeared. In 1464 a 16,000kg cannon known as the Great Turkish Bombard was created in the Ottoman Empire. Cannon as field artillery became more important after 1453 with the introduction of limber, which greatly improved cannon maneuverability and mobility. European cannon reached their longer, lighter, more accurate, and more efficient [...] "classic form" [...] around 1480. This classic European cannon design stayed relatively consistent in form with minor changes until the 1750s.|$|E

2500|$|Even older, the Ningxia gun {{was found}} in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region by {{collector}} Meng Jianmin (孟建民). This Yuan dynasty firearm is 34.6cm long, the muzzle 2.6cm in diameter, and weighs 1.55 kilograms. The firearm contains a transcription reading, [...] "Made by bronzesmith Li Liujing in the year Zhiyuan 8 (直元), ningzi number 2565" [...] (銅匠作頭李六徑，直元捌年造，寧字二仟伍百陸拾伍號). Similar to the Xanadu Gun, it bears a serial number 2565, which suggests {{it may have been}} part of a series of guns manufactured. While the era name and date corresponds with the Gregorian Calendar at 1271 CE, putting it earlier than both the Heilongjiang Hand Gun as well as the Xanadu Gun, but one of the characters used in the era name is irregular, causing some doubt among scholars on the exact <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E

60|$|A nation {{dealing in}} a {{currency}} {{below that of}} specie in value labors under two great disadvantages: First, having no use for the world's acknowledged medium of exchange, gold and silver, these are driven {{out of the country}} because {{there is no need for}} their use; second, the medium of exchange in use being of a fluctuating value--for, after all, it is only worth just what it will purchase of gold and silver, metals having an intrinsic value just in proportion to the honest labor it takes to produce them--a larger margin must be allowed for profit by the manufacturer and producer. It is months from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> to the date of realization. Interest upon capital must be charged, and risk of fluctuation in the value of that which is to be received in payment added. Hence high prices, acting as a protection to the foreign producer, who receives nothing in exchange for the products of his skill and labor except a currency good, at a stable value, the world over It seems to me that nothing is clearer than that the greater part of the burden of existing prostration, for the want of a sound financial system, falls upon the working man, who must after all produce the wealth, and the salaried man, who superintends and conducts business. The burden falls upon them in two ways--by the deprivation of employment and by the decreased purchasing power of their salaries. It is the duty of Congress to devise the method of correcting the evils which are acknowledged to exist, and not mine. But I will venture to suggest two or three things which seem to me as absolutely necessary to a return to specie payments, the first great requisite in a return to prosperity. The legal-tender clause to the law authorizing the issue of currency by the National Government should be repealed, to take effect as to all contracts entered into after a day fixed in the repealing act--not to apply, however, to payments of salaries by Government, or for other expenditures now provided by law to be paid in currency, in the interval pending between repeal and final resumption. Provision should be made by which the Secretary of the Treasury can obtain gold as it may become necessary from time to time from the date when specie redemption commences. To this might and should be added a revenue sufficiently in excess of expenses to insure an accumulation of gold in the Treasury to sustain permanent redemption.|$|E
