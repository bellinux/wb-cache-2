Fairweather’ conditions, i.e., days with absence of high winds, drifting or falling snow and clouds. The diurnal variation curve of electric field during fairweather days is a single periodic with a minimum at 04 : 00 UT and a maximum at 19 : 00 UT. But atmospheric current variation has minimum 03 : 00 UT for Maxwell current and conduction current. The maximum for Maxwell current is at 20 : 00 UT and 19 : 00 UT for the conduction current, which is very similar to the Carnegie curve.

Plants annually maintain a periodical course with maximum values during summer and minimum values in winter. The highest P-E activity is always concentrated in the trunk cambia layers. The comparison of the health state and the values of P-E currents have brought new dimensions in the classification of tree vitality. Healthy trees reach the highest P-E currents. The worst {{is the state of}} a tree the quicker is the rate of deterioration. The entire changing process of a tree's health state can be precisely monitored. Assessing a tree's health state with visual methods is not precise. Changes of the mesh <b>electric</b> <b>conduction</b> are related to changes in water capacity and electrolytes concentration. <b>Electric</b> <b>conduction</b> of the mesh seldom changes at short intervals. Measuring electric impedance or <b>electric</b> <b>conduction</b> of a tree mesh in cambial zones can be used to determine cambial activity, which correlates to tree vitality. During the dormant phase vitality decreases and electric resistence in the mesh increases. The given electric characteristics are influenced by certain physiological processes such as the metabolism and growth intensity. However, these factors are co-related to the tree's vitality. Measuring electronic resistance of the mesh in the cambial zone has proved that its changes are co-related to season changes. The lower resistance values correlates to higher relative vitality of the tree. One can name it electric impedance or <b>electric</b> <b>conduction</b> of tree tree mesh.

30|$|We {{present the}} {{electron}} transport in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) at high <b>electric</b> bias <b>conduction.</b> When graphene is patterned {{into a few}} tens of nanometer width of a ribbon shape, the carriers are confined to a quasi-one-dimensional (1 D) system. Combining with the disorders in the system, this quantum confinement can lead into a transport gap in the energy spectrum of the GNRs. Similar to CNTs, this gap depends on {{the width of the}} GNR. In this review, we examine the electronic properties of lithographically fabricated GNRs, focusing on the high bias transport characteristics of GNRs as a function of density tuned by a gate voltage. We investigate the transport behavior of devices biased up to a few volts, a regime more relevant for electronics applications. We find that the high bias transport behavior in this limit can be described by hot electron scattered by the surface phonon emission, leading to a carrier velocity saturation. We also showed an enhanced current saturation effect in the GNRs with an efficient gate coupling. This effect results from the introduction of the charge neutrality point into the channel, and is similar to pinch-off in MOSFET devices. We also observe that heating effects in graphene at high bias are significant.|$|R
