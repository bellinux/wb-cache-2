5|$|Experimental {{evidence}} supporting the Watson and Crick model {{was published in}} a series of five articles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue</b> of Nature. Of these, Franklin and Gosling's paper was the first publication of their own X-ray diffraction data and original analysis method that partly supported the Watson and Crick model; this issue also contained an article on DNA structure by Maurice Wilkins and two of his colleagues, whose analysis and in vivo B-DNA X-ray patterns also supported the presence in vivo of the double-helical DNA configurations as proposed by Crick and Watson for their double-helix molecular model of DNA in the prior two pages of Nature. In 1962, after Franklin's death, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Nobel Prizes are awarded only to living recipients. A debate continues about who should receive credit for the discovery.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on May 3, 2006, The New York Times addressed the controversy. The paper acknowledged that the mainstream media—itself included—had been criticized for focusing on Bush's act with Bridges while ignoring Colbert's speech. The paper then quoted several passages of Colbert's more substantial criticism {{of the president and}} discussed various reactions to the event. On May 15, The New York Times public editor, Byron Calame, wrote on his blog that more than two hundred readers had written to complain about the exclusion of any mention of Colbert from the paper's initial lengthy article covering the dinner. Calame quoted his deputy bureau chief in Washington, who said that a mention of Colbert in the first article could not have been long enough to do his routine justice. But he also noted that the paper should have printed an in-depth article specifically covering Colbert's speech <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue,</b> rather than waiting until days after the fact.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} discovery, {{separate}} teams, one led by David Charbonneau including Timothy Brown and others, {{and the other}} by Gregory W. Henry, were able to detect a transit of the planet {{across the surface of}} the star making it the first known transiting extrasolar planet. On September 9 and 16, 1999, Charbonneau's team measured a 1.7% drop in HD209458's brightness, which was attributed to the passage of the planet across the star. On November 8, Henry's team observed a partial transit, seeing only the ingress. Initially unsure of their results, the Henry group decided to rush their results to publication after overhearing rumors that Charbonneau had successfully seen an entire transit in September. Papers from both teams were published simultaneously <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue</b> of the Astrophysical Journal. Each transit lasts about three hours, during which the planet covers about 1.5% of the star's face.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{critical}} account of Gaston Leroux’s Le Fantôme de l’Opéra (1910), which {{has become one of}} the most enduring and visible of modern myths. Leroux’s text discloses anxieties about a rapidly changing world, and these anxieties manifest themselves artistically in a simultaneous fascination and horror with the emerging episteme. Leroux’s story subsequently took on a life of its own in popular culture, yet, this thesis argues, many of these adaptations remain bound up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issues</b> of futurity and dichotomies of masculinity, as well as concerns about the role of <b>the</b> artist <b>in</b> determining <b>the</b> values of his society.

25|$|Regarding {{the issue}} of whether the breadth of infant {{attachment}} functioning can be captured by a categorical classification scheme, {{it should be noted that}} continuous measures of attachment security have been developed which have demonstrated adequate psychometric properties. These have been used either individually or in conjunction with discrete attachment classifications in many published reports. The original Richter's et al. (1998) scale is strongly related to secure versus insecure classifications, correctly predicting about 90% of cases. Readers further interested in the categorical versus continuous nature of attachment classifications (and the debate surrounding this issue) should consult a paper by Fraley and Spieker and the rejoinders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue</b> by many prominent attachment researchers including J. Cassidy, A. Sroufe, E. Waters & T. Beauchaine, and M. Cummings.|$|E
25|$|Luthor {{returns in}} Superman #4 and steals a weapon from the U.S. Army that {{is capable of}} causing {{earthquake}}s. Superman battles and defeats Luthor, and the earthquake device is destroyed by Superman. The scientist who made the device commits suicide to prevent its reinvention. In a story <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue,</b> Luthor is also shown to have created a city on the sunken Lost Continent of Pacifo and to have recreated prehistoric monsters, which he plans to unleash upon the world. Superman thwarts his plans, and Luthor appears to have been killed by the dinosaurs he created. Luthor returns in Superman #5 with a plan to place hypnotic gas in the offices of influential people. He intends to throw the nation into a depression with the help of corrupt financier Moseley, but the story ends with Superman defeating him.|$|E
25|$|Two 2008 studies, both {{published}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue</b> of Scienceexpress, {{questioned the}} previous assessments. A {{team led by}} Searchinger from Princeton University concluded that once direct and indirect effect of land use changes (ILUC) are considered, both corn and cellulosic ethanol increased carbon emissions as compared to gasoline by 93 and 50 percent respectively. The study limited the analysis to a 30-year time horizon, assuming that land conversion emitted 25 percent of the carbon stored in soils and all carbon in plants cleared for cultivation. Brazil, China and India were considered among the overseas locations where land use change would occur {{as a result of}} diverting U.S. corn cropland, and it was assumed that new cropland in each of these regions correspond to different types of forest, savanna or grassland based on the historical proportion of each natural land converted to cultivation in these countries during the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|The University of Montana Law Review {{published}} three articles {{addressing this}} topic in its winter 2007 issue. David K. DeWolf, John G. West and Casey Luskin, senior fellows or {{officers of the}} Discovery Institute, argued that intelligent design is a valid scientific theory, that the Jones court should not have addressed {{the question of whether}} it was a scientific theory, and that the decision will have no effect on the development and adoption of intelligent design as an alternative to standard evolutionary theory. Peter Irons responded to the DeWolf et al. article, arguing that the decision was extremely well reasoned, and that it marks the end to legal efforts by the intelligent design movement to introduce creationism in public schools. It had been {{an essential part of the}} ruling to consider whether ID was a legitimate scientific theory as claimed by its proponents, and DeWolf, et al. had implicitly recognised this by citing the Lemon test, which would have been irrelevant if ID were legitimate science.
