5|$|Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru {{revolves}} around the main protagonist Mizuho Miyanokouji, a male high school student. After Mizuho's grandfather dies, his will is reviewed, which explains his desire to have his grandson transfer to Seio Girls' Academy, the same one his own mother attended and his ancestors founded. Abiding by the will, Mizuho cross-dresses to attend the school. The headmistress, the deputy head teacher (visual novel only), Mizuho's homeroom teacher Hisako Kajiura and Mariya Mikado initially know his secret; Shion Jujo and Ichiko Takashima also eventually find this out. Mizuho is very popular among the other students, who often talk about <b>how</b> <b>pretty,</b> nice, and athletic Mizuho is. This rampant popularity escalates to him even being nominated against his will to join in on the Elder election. By these terms, the current student council president, Takako Itsukushima, runs against Mizuho.|$|E
25|$|Chichekler (meaning {{flowers in}} Azeri) {{is a very}} elegant dance. In origin this dance is {{performed}} by women in two different forms: slow and fast. It was created in 1910. The group of girls gathers together and collect flowers. They would like to show off and demonstrate to the public <b>how</b> <b>pretty</b> flowers look. Flowers are associated with <b>how</b> <b>pretty</b> the girls are in the colorful costumes. They form circles and triangles during the dance. Sophisticated hand movements and spins create very cheerful atmosphere. The music is up-bit and energetic.|$|E

[...] She added that in the series, [...] "You see the makings of a villain, but she doesn't start off evil. She starts off manipulative and not the nicest person you've ever met, but she's not a bad guy when you first meet her." [...] Fazekas additionally noted how the sexist themes of the times were handled, by showing [...] "that the only way Whitney Frost felt she could exert power in the world was through her husband, because she had been told her whole life, 'Nobody cares how smart you are, they care about <b>how</b> <b>pretty</b> you are.'" [...] On Frost's relationship with Chadwick, Everett called him [...] "her best friend.

500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking <b>how</b> <b>pretty</b> the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head out. I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl on my hands and knees and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E

The woman, as described in the article, alleged that there were two encounters at Moore's house, the first of which being a date where he [...] "told her <b>how</b> <b>pretty</b> she was and kissed her." [...] On a second date, Moore allegedly [...] "took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes...touched her over her bra and underpants...and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear." [...] Three other women came forward to say that Moore, in his 30s, pursued relationships with them when they were 16 to 18 years old, with 16 being the legal age of consent in Alabama. These three women said that Moore did not force them into having a relationship or non-consensual sexual contact. [...] Moore has denied these allegations, calling them [...] "completely false" [...] and [...] "a desperate political attack by the National Democratic Party and The Washington Post." ...|$|E
