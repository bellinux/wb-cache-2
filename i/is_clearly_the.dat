25|$|Some notable {{drawings}} and sketches {{are associated with}} Pisanello's medal. One is a highly finished pen drawing of a saddled and harnessed horse from the front and the back (The Louvre, Vallardi, 2468, fol. 277). The horse from the back <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> same horse {{as that of the}} emperor's squire on the reverse of the medal. The horse is very likely to have come from a Byzantine stable because of its slit nostrils. It was believed in some oriental countries that slitting the nostrils of horses enabled them to breathe easier under exertion. A similarly maltreated horse is depicted in the centre of the Paris sheet of sketches of John and members of his retinue.|$|E

500|$|In a 1986 {{article for}} The New York Times on Coleman's work with Prime Time, Robert Palmer said Of Human Feelings was still {{innovative}} and radical {{by the standards}} of other music in 1982, three years after it was recorded. Because writers and musicians had heard its test pressing in 1979, the album's mix of jazz improvisation and gritty, punk and funk-derived energy sounded [...] "prophetic" [...] when it was released, Palmer explained. [...] "The album <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> progenitor of much that has sounded radically new in the ongoing fusion of punk rock, black dance rhythms, and free jazz." [...] AllMusic critic Scott Yanow said although Coleman's compositions never achieved popularity, they succeeded within the context of an album that showcased his distinctive saxophone style, which was high-brow yet catchy. Joshua Klein from The A.V. Club recommended Of Human Feelings as the best album for new listeners of Coleman's harmolodics-based music, while Chicago Tribune rock critic Greg Kot included it in his guide for novice jazz listeners; he named it one of the few albums that helped him both become a better listener of rock music and learn how to enjoy jazz. In 2008, New York magazine's Martin Johnson included it in his list of canonical albums from what he felt had been New York's sceneless yet vital jazz of the previous 40 years; Of Human Feelings exuded what he described as a spirit of sophistication with elements of funk, Latin, and African music, all of which were encapsulated by music that retained a jazz identity.|$|E

Mikael Good from Entertainment Weekly termed Sale el Sol as a demonstration of [...] "Shakira's boldly global mindset" [...] and awarded it a perfect [...] "A" [...] grade. Jesus Yanez-Reyes from Northern Arizona News favoured the album's rock-influenced tracks and concluding that Sale el Sol [...] "is one of Shakira’s best releases, with songs sure to become classics within the next year". Mikel Toombs from Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that the album features Shakira [...] "at her most upbeat". Jennifer Schaffer from Stanford Daily called Sale el Sol a [...] "fantastically diverse album with some awesome collaborations and a truly impressive range of emotions", and commended Shakira's vocal delivery, saying [...] "the sheer power of Shakira's vocal chords <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> focus of the album". Allison Stewart felt the album was a showcase for Shakira's [...] "remarkable" [...] voice, and concluded that while Sale el Sol is not [...] "necessarily adventurous", it [...] "provides a better showcase for Shakira's countless charms than its predecessors ever did". Carlos Macias from Terra USA, however, gave the album a mixed review and said it [...] "delivers half the goods".|$|E
