40|$|Summary. This chapter explores {{three aspects}} of {{learning}} in document analysis: (1) <b>field</b> <b>classification,</b> (2) interactive recognition, and (3) portable and networked applications. Context in document classification conventionally refers to language context, i. e., deterministic or statistical constraints on the sequence of letters in syllables or words, and on the sequence of words in phrases or sentences. We show how to exploit other types of statistical dependence, specifically the dependence between the shape features of several patterns due to the common source of the patterns within a field or a document. This type of dependence leads to <b>field</b> <b>classification,</b> where the features of some patterns may reveal useful information about the features of other patterns from the same source but not necessarily from the same class. We explore the relationship between <b>field</b> <b>classification</b> and the older concepts of unsupervised learning and adaptation. Human interaction is often more effective interspersed with algorithmic processes than only {{before or after the}} automated parts of the process. We develop a taxonomy for interaction during training and testing, and show how either human-initiated and machine-initiated interaction can lead to human and machine learning. In a section on new technologies, we discuss how new cameras and displays, web-wide access, interoperability, and essentially unlimited storage provide fertile new approaches to document analysis. ...|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper we explicitly constructed a mapping that leads Dirac spinor fields to the dual-helicity eigenspinors {{of the charge}} conjugation operator (ELKO spinor fields). ELKO spinor fields are prime candidates for describing dark matter, and belong to a wider class of spinor fields, the so-called flagpole spinor fields, corresponding to the class-(5), according to Lounesto spinor <b>field</b> <b>classification,</b> based on the relations and values taken by their associated bilinear covariants. Such a mapping between Dirac and ELKO spinor fields was obtained {{in an attempt to}} extend the Standard Model in order to encompass dark matter. Now we prove that such a mapping, analogous to the instanton Hopf fibration map S^ 3 [...] . S^ 7 → S^ 4, prevents ELKO to describe the instanton, giving a suitable physical interpretation to ELKO. We review ELKO spinor fields as type-(5) spinor fields under the Lounesto spinor <b>field</b> <b>classification,</b> explicitly computing the associated bilinear covariants. This paper is also devoted to investigate some formal aspects of the flag-dipole spinor fields, which correspond to the class-(4) under the Lounesto spinor <b>field</b> <b>classification.</b> In addition, we prove that type-(4) spinor fields (corresponding to flag-dipoles) and ELKO spinor fields (corresponding to flagpoles) can also be entirely described in terms of the Majorana and Weyl spinor fields. After all, by choosing a projection endomorphism of the spacetime algebra Cl(1, 3) it is shown how to obtain ELKO, flagpole, Majorana and Weyl spinor fields, respectively corresponding to type-(5) and -(6) spinor fields, uniquely from limiting cases of a type-(4) (flag-dipole) spinor field, in a similar result obtained by Lounesto.

40|$|We {{show that}} the Einstein-Hilbert, the Einstein-Palatini, and the Holst actions {{can be derived from}} the Quadratic Spinor Lagrangian (QSL), when the three classes of Dirac spinor fields, under Lounesto spinor <b>field</b> <b>classification,</b> are considered. To each one of these classes, there {{corresponds}} a unique kind of action for a covariant gravity theory. In other words, it is shown to exist a one-to-one correspondence between the three classes of non-equivalent solutions of the Dirac equation, and Einstein-Hilbert, Einstein-Palatini, and Holst actions. Furthermore, it arises naturally, from Lounesto spinor <b>field</b> <b>classification,</b> that any other class of spinor field (Weyl, Majorana, flagpole, or flag-dipole spinor fields) yields a trivial (zero) QSL, up to a boundary term. To investigate this boundary term we do not impose any constraint on the Dirac spinor field, and consequently we obtain new terms in the boundary component of the QSL. In the particular case of a teleparallel connection, an axial torsion 1 -form current density is obtained. New terms are also obtained in the corresponding Hamiltonian formalism. We then discuss how these new terms could shed new light on more general investigations. Comment: 9 pages, RevTeX, to be published in Int. J. Mod. Phys. D (2007...|$|E
