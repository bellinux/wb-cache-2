Eight distinct subdivisions, clearly delimited both by their cytoarchitectonic and fibrous characteristics, have been identified. They are: the commissural, gelatinous, lateral, interstitial, dorsolateral, ventrolateral, intermediate and medial subdivisions. Their rostrocaudal extensions and locations in relation to the obex are summarised in Table 1. A morphometric analysis was additionally done. The frequency distributions of cell areas and cell form <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> each <b>subdivision</b> are represented by histograms in Figures 8 and 9 respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{conservation}} planning across the landscape, regardless of tenure, is widely recognised. In Australia, attempts {{to coordinate the}} management of conservation lands are characterised by models such as Biosphere Reserves and Conservation Management Networks. This paper outlines the history behind the formation and development of three networks in Australia—the Bookmark Biosphere Reserve, the Gippsland Plains Conservation Management Network, and the Grassy Box Woodlands Conservation Management Network—with particular emphasis on the tenure and protection attributes of the various components within these networks. Despite having a similar number of components, the total area represented in the networks varied markedly. There were few similarities {{in the proportion of}} components of various tenures and protection mechanisms among networks. Composition of networks is likely to be strongly influenced by both historical <b>factors</b> (degree <b>of</b> <b>subdivision,</b> land ownership and remaining vegetation) and contemporary <b>factors</b> (aims <b>of</b> the network and willingness of landowners to participate). Continued research into both the evolution and the physical and social dynamics of multi-tenure reserve networks enables a better understanding of their operation, and will ultimately assist in improved conservation planning across the landscape. <br /...|$|R

40|$|At present, {{the ease}} <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> <b>of</b> scored tablets is {{estimated}} in vivo. In order to replace such {{in vivo testing}} {{and to develop a}} surrogate test which uses in vitro techniques, the association between physical parameters of scored tablets and their ease <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> was studied. The physical properties of 23 brands of scored tablets of which their ease <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> in vivo was known were established. Statistical modeling using a logistic regression model was used to fit the data and estimate the contribution of each physical parameter to the goodness of the fit. For scored oblong tablets, the critical parameters for their ease <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> are: diameter; diameter/width ratio; depth of score line and resistance to crushing. Criteria for each of these parameters were derived. All criteria need to be complied with to guarantee sufficient ease <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> <b>of</b> scored oblong tablets. For scored round tablets the critical parameters, in decreasing order of importance, for their ease <b>of</b> <b>subdivision,</b> are: resistance to crushing, diameter, score mark (one- or two-sided), and shape (flat or biconvex). A five-parameter predictive model was developed, showing excellent discrimination. For development, the proposed surrogate tests are sufficiently reliable. For release testing and stability studies, resistance to crushing of a scored tablet is a reliable predictor of its ease <b>of</b> <b>subdivision.</b> © 2010 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a method <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> surface quality {{assessment}} by reflection lines on pro-grammable graphics hardware (GPU). Using reflection lines is effective for surface quality assessment because {{the shapes of}} these lines are changed according to a slight variance of surface shapes. This fact also implies that reflection lines should be calculated precisely. We introduce an intuitive, fast and robust approach for calculating reflec-tion lines by using a plane light source texture based on a fragment program of recently introduced GPU. In addition, we describe a method of calculating position and normal <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> surfaces for each fragment on GPU. As our framework for calculating reflection lines {{does not depend on}} the level <b>of</b> <b>subdivision,</b> a precise assessment can be established even for low levels <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> polygons...|$|R

The first few sections are devoted to the history <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> modeling and the review <b>of</b> existing <b>subdivision</b> schemes in detail.

In addition, we review prior work using subdivision technique in various applications. The {{latter part of the}} paper devote to our novel subdivision solid schemes, ongoing research topics, and new ideas.
