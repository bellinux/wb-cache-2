Emergency survival represents a set of measures, which are applied in order to minimize the negative impacts of emergencies and crisis situations on the population. The most important and fundamental measures in the field of emergency survival is emergency accommodation, which is governed by methodological sheet No. 8 /Ob Accommodation evacuees, Emergency accommodation (on sheet No. 8 /Ob). In the place of the emergency accommodation occurs to the implementation of the other measures of emergency survival. Sheet No. 8 /Ob is a default document, where is defined the place of emergency accommodation, set individuals perequisites, requirement and recommendations. The theoretical part focuses of the defining the concept of emergency survival, along with the related concept of the terminology of the protection of the population. Individual measures of the emergency survival consist of emergency accommodation, emergency food supplies, emergency of drinking water supplies, emergency basic services to the population, the emergency energy supply, the provision of humanitarian assistance. The above measures are the contents of the emergency plan in the section plans for concrete actions emergency survival plan. For processing was set the following target. Asseess the effective security of emergency survival of the population in the municipality Týn nad Vltavou. The risk analysis of the municipality Týn nad Vltavou lists as the biggest threat to the risk of flooding, which subsequently leads to the evacuation of the population. Flood plan includes 2 objects, one of them is home for youth belonging to the middle vocational school, whose owner is the region of South Bohemia and next one object is a hotel in ownership. Of these objects only home for youth has a dining facility. On the basis of familiarity with the situation in Týn nad Vltavou occurs to a finding that it is not appropriate for the object processed documentation space accommodation evacuees. For this reason, there is a Contact Manager crisis Department ODA Týn nad Vltavou (hereinafter reffered to {{as the head of the}} Department) with a proposal to identify the object of the educational establishment in Týn nad Vltavou, which could be used as a place of emergency accommodation. The head od the Department has approved the object of the educational establishment, which is the Elementary school Hlinecká in Týn nad Vltavou (hereinafter reffered to as the ES Hlinecká). The results section contains the introduction to the municipality Týn nad Vltavou, the map representation, along with specifying the location of ES Hlinecká in Týn nad Vltavou. Subsequently, the work focuses on reconnaissance object ES Hlinecká with the description of the ES Hlinecká campus and individual floors.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} spatial {{arrangement and}} placement are considered par excellence among the instrumental functions of rhetoric. I unsettle {{the canon of}} arrangement in consideration of the spatial turn. Approaching space by way of arrangement brings to bear a different range of phenomena and is {{a departure from the}} prevailing practices of existing scholarship on rhetorical memory places. Rhetorical arrangements of space, their deep structure and underlying coherence in public discourse, are contingent and unstable. Arrangements of space widely circulating in public discourse furnish provisional order to orient life, politics, and planning. Arrangements of space have inherent thresholds, limits periodically exposed and contested in public discourse warranting displacement. Despite displacement, traces of past arrangements of space are preserved in public documents and leave lasting impressions on the built environment. Accordingly, space may be viewed as a layered rhetorical document; a work in progress whose surface writing has recorded over imperfectly erased remnants of earlier <b>drafts.</b> Former <b>arrangements</b> of space and their displacement may be uncovered and interpreted by the critic. The methodology I develop in this dissertation, a rhetorical cartography, entails evaluating numerous arrangements and displacements of space across time. I analyze arrangements and displacements of Atlanta’s urban space to demonstrate the methodological import of a rhetorical cartography. Rhetorical invention and (re) arrangement of Atlanta is the city’s most enduring and pronounced characteristic, aggressively made and remade through forms of boosterism that has been labeled the “Atlanta Spirit. ” The first chapter details rhetorical invention and arrangement of Atlanta as a regional railroad center, recognized as the “Gate City of the South. ” The second chapter introduces pivotal displacement of Atlanta as urban space became centrally rearranged within the logics of race, as the “City Too Busy To Hate. ” In the third chapter I focus on arrangements of Atlanta as an “International City,” linked with discourses of global economics and multiculturalism. The fourth chapter analyzes recent rearrangement as “Sustainable Atlanta,” linked to environmental discourses, with ecological and planetary scope. The cartography evinces the rhetorical vitality, multiplicity, and openness of Atlanta’s urban space...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiences}} {{and the practice}} of many countries show that countertrade could be used as the significant method for incensement of the export {{as well as for the}} promotion of the foreign investments even in the period of deep financial crises. Contemporary governments' pro-active countertrade orientation in USA, Israel, Sweden, Norway, Japan and other developed countries highlights the inadequacy of the obsolete and stereotypical concept of the countertrade as the compensation transaction based on the 'trade without money' concept. Besides this, the practices proved that countertrade transactions are the consequence and the indicator of economic shocks. Therefore, the study of the special legal issues that may arise in countertrade transactions will be very important not only for the domestic legal doctrine but also for the commercial practice. As national laws do not contain provisions specific for countertrade, it is of particular importance to analyze legal question such as structuring and <b>drafting</b> of countertrade <b>arrangements</b> as well as to study the question of the legal nature of the contractual link between legal instruments which form multicontractual mechanism of countertrade transactions. The character of the legal connection among the legal instruments in countertrade arrangement, as well as the legal nature of the countertrade commitment, strongly influence the countertrade agreement's legal nature. The economic reality of a group of contracts joined by the common goal of the transaction (consideration) and the countertrade commitment has to be followed by the legal reality which will recognize the legal interdependence of the obligation deriving from the legally independent countertrade arrangement...|$|R

40|$|Newly {{exporting}} {{small and}} medium-sized enterprises have not, to date, has sufficient focus from the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation 2 ̆ 7 s assistance with export finance and insurance, according to this report. Key points These key points were released with the Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Export Credit <b>Arrangements</b> <b>draft</b> report on 22 February 2012. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) has been established to facilitate and encourage Australian export trade through the provision of financial services. It provides these services on a commercial account and manages the national interest account on behalf of the Australian Government. The rationale for EFIC operating a commercial account should be to address the limited number of market failures in financial markets that impede otherwise commercially viable export transactions. At present EFIC 2 ̆ 7 s activity on the commercial account is largely focussed on large corporate clients and often repeat customers. The Commission has found no convincing evidence to indicate there are failures in financial markets that impede access to finance for large firms, or for domestic resource projects. EFIC should not continue to provide finance to large corporate clients or for domestic resource projects on the commercial account. The Commission 2 ̆ 7 s preliminary assessment is that there may be some instances of information-related failures in financial markets, and that these failures may impede otherwise commercially viable export transactions. To the extent that they exist, these information-related failures are only likely to affect newly exporting {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) accessing export finance. Until it is next reviewed, EFIC 2 ̆ 7 s commercial account objective should be to address the information-related failures in financial markets that affect newly exporting SMEs. EFIC 2 ̆ 7 s role should be to demonstrate to the private sector that providing export finance to these exporters can be commercially viable. EFIC must provide export finance services on the same basis as the private sector. This means EFIC should: charge a price covering the full economic cost of provision be subject to competitive neutrality policy including earning an appropriately benchmarked rate of return on equity, setting prices commensurate with the level of risk undertaken, and paying a tax equivalent charge and a debt neutrality fee publish information on the transactions it approves on the commercial account, including the name of the firm, price and other terms of provision. EFIC 2 ̆ 7 s commercial account product range should be limited to guarantees. When directed by the Minister for Trade, the product range on the commercial account may extend to reinsurance, for a limited period, to cover sovereign and country risk insurance provided to SMEs. EFIC 2 ̆ 7 s activities on the commercial account have earned a relatively low rate of return on equity. Some transactions on the commercial account are subsidised by taxpayers. The Commission 2 ̆ 7 s proposals seek to address this. Measures should be introduced to improve the transparency of EFIC 2 ̆ 7 s activities to the Minister for Trade, the Australian Government, and the public. Measures should also be introduced by the Australian Government to improve the transparency of national interest account transactions.

40|$|The Murray-Darling Basin Agreements {{had their}} genesis in {{disputes}} between upstream States (Victoria and New South Wales) and a downstream State (South Australia) {{over the use}} of basin waters. While originally the disputes concerned navigation, for most of the twentieth century, the rivers' use for irrigation has been of more importance. The 1914 Murray Waters Agreement, between the Commonwealth government and those of the three basin States, was essentially a compact defining allocation of water to the parties concerned. Agreements on the Murray-Darling basin have evolved from this narrowly-based concept to one in which the natural resources of the basin are to be managed as a whole. At the same time, an institutional structure for the operation of water control works has developed which is able to make policy for resource management in the basin. The present Agreement covers water, land and environmental resources, and contains provisions for strategies intended to enable the integrated and sustainable development of the basin in the future. The Mekong Agreements, rather than representing a consistent evolution towards a legal framework for comprehensive basin management, have instead reflected the political evolution of the region. The 1957 Statute was a limited compact establishing the Mekong Committee for the Co-ordination of Investigation. It made no provision for basin management, nor for the equitable use or sharing of basin water. It was established to a large extent as an expression of the influence of the United States in the region. Its successor, the Joint Declaration of 1975, was a more comprehensive document, and used the Helsinki Rules of 1966 as a model. While it included principles of cooperation between riparian States, which could be used to ensure equitable use of water, it did not provide an adequate institutional structure for the management of basin resources. The 1975 Declaration was drafted during a hiatus in the conflict in South East Asia; and because one of the signatory States - the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) - ceased to exist with the fall of Saigon, it was never applied. Interim arrangements were in place until 1995 during the absence of Cambodia from the international body politic. The <b>drafting</b> of new <b>arrangements</b> was then precipitated by Thailand's expulsion of the head of the Mekong Secretariat, effectively bringing the status quo to an end. The Mekong Agreement of 1995 establishes a new Commission, and states its purpose to be the sustainable development of basin resources. It relies on a co-operative approach, rather than establishing comprehensive criteria for water use, {{with the exception of the}} Mekong mainstream in the dry season. In addition, there is no provision for projects on tributaries to be submitted to the Commission for an evaluation of their effect downstream. In contrast to the arrangement under the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement, it confers no powers on the Commission to control basin waters, or to manage the regime in an effective manner, and to ensure equity between basin States. If development in a rational and equitable manner is assured, legal and institutional arrangements should be able to endure the ebb and flow of international relations. The need for an appropriate instrument to accommodate changing circumstances in the Mekong basin is made the more important by the prospect of the two upper basin States (China and Myanmar) joining the Agreement in the future. The Murray-Darling Basin Agreement, while it is a less than ideal model for legislation in this field, nevertheless offers guidance on how the new Mekong Agreement may be developed. This applies both to the management of basin resources, and to the preparation of strategies directed towards the objectives of the Agreement. The 1995 Mekong Agreement will be examined in the perspective that legislation should be stable and not static. While the Agreement has been duly praised for its intention of developing the basin through co-operation between States, this thesis looks at ways in which it may be improved. Significant issues effecting the choice of institutional and legal arrangements in both basins are identified and discussed. Findings from this comparison suggest a context for the further evolution of the institutional and legal framework to support the rational management and sustainable development of the Mekong basin.

40|$|Four {{years ago}} the federal {{government}} created the Job Network. Tony Eardley assesses its record WHEN the Job Network started in 1998 it was heralded by some (and reviled by others) as a radical experiment in service delivery. Now {{four and a half}} years old, it is shortly to undergo another transformation to fit the new Active Participation Model, itself devised to reflect what has been learned about the Network’s successes and failures over the last four years. The Productivity Commission’s final report on the Job Network (and the government’s response) has also just been published, along with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations’ third evaluation. It seems a good time to take stock of what we know about this radical experiment. The two latest reports contain a mass of interesting detail - which is welcome given the relative paucity of information available in the early years of the Job Network. A few key points stand out. The department’s evaluation of the net impact of Job Network services is based on new research methods that take better account of three factors that are likely to be important. These are: the ‘compliance effect’ - the effect on job seekers’ behaviour from simply being referred to a program; the ‘program effect - the actual benefit gained from the services provided on the program; and the ‘attachment effect’ - the often negative impact of reduced job search effort while involved in a program. On the basis of these methods, the department’s own estimates suggest that the average net employment impacts of assistance are marginal - just over 2 per cent for Intensive Assistance and between 7 and 8 per cent for Job Search Training. Most of the impact (virtually all in the case of Intensive Assistance) seems to be achieved not through program assistance itself, but as a result of people moving off income support and (at some point) into work simply by being referred to the programs. The assumption in the latter case is that people, when referred, either increase their own job search effort or are already working unofficially. This sounds like poor policy. Given that referral seems to have more effect than the assistance itself, is tempting to offer the ‘modest proposal’ that we should abolish the actual program of Intensive Assistance, but keep referring people to it anyway! But the results are perhaps not as bad as they seem at first sight. The new estimation methods are tentative and conservative, while the averages conceal variations that suggest significantly higher net impacts for more disadvantaged job seekers. Overall the results are not hugely out of line with international experience, and are probably similar to those achieved under previous assistance arrangements. The DEWR evaluation also reports some interesting longitudinal analysis of Job Network outcomes, which suggests that many of the jobs achieved last longer than might have been expected. It also points to some movement up the ladder in terms of wages and hours of work on the part of Job Network clients - though this trend is less marked among those who began with relatively low-quality jobs. The second key finding of the reports is that these admittedly modest outcomes have been achieved at a much-reduced cost to the taxpayer. There seems little doubt that competition within the framework of Job Network has produced efficiency gains, and that some provider agencies have been innovative in developing effective relationships both with job seekers and with employers. On the other hand, both these reports and other independent research such as our own at the Social Policy Research Centre have found that competition among service providers and the incentives implicit in the funding structure have led to ‘parking’ of harder-to-place job seekers becoming common. The twin problems of ‘parking’ (a reluctance to put effort or expenses into harder-to-place clients) and ‘deadweight’ (the high proportion of positive outcomes likely to have happened without assistance) present serious policy dilemmas. The question of how to deal with these problems marks a point of distinction between the different responses of the Productivity Commission and the government. On the one hand the research outcomes suggest the need for a higher threshold of disadvantage for access to Intensive Assistance, in order to reduce the amount of deadweight in the system. On the other hand there is the equally pressing question of how to help the already more than 60 per cent who go through such assistance without getting an outcome - as well as those coming round for a second time. Overall, the Productivity Commission (as might be anticipated) has opted in favour of greater competition and a purer market-based solution. It suggests deregulating the ways in which providers are able to assist their clients by giving them greater freedom to refer those with greater barriers to employment to other programs (such as community work or Work for the Dole). It proposes discarding the system of competitive tendering - which it sees as cumbersome and over-controlled by the department - in favour of a licensing system, which it argues will provide freer entry for providers to the employment services market. And it advocates giving job seekers more freedom to move between providers. These proposals run counter to the general thrust of the government’s plans for the next Job Network round (DEWR, 2000 c). These emphasise stabilising and consolidating the market around a core group of high-performing agencies, along with some re-regulation to prevent some of the more dubious ‘innovations’ of previous rounds (such as bogus job creation). It provides for more rather than less specification of what providers must do for job seekers, in order to address the problem of limited assistance to those who are hard to place. Nevertheless, the government has either adopted or is seriously considering a number of the Productivity Commission proposals, including abandoning price competition, opening up job matching to other licensed recruitment agencies and focusing on shorter intervention periods for intensive support. The restructuring of the former Community Support Program into a much-expanded Personal Support Program under the Department of Family and Community Services also recognises that many of those going through assistance without getting outcomes have multiple disadvantages. Thus it moves some way in the direction of the Commission’s proposals for focusing Job Network services more on those with the capacity to benefit. Although the department’s evaluation speaks the language of incremental improvement and fine-tuning, the government’s response to the Productivity Commission report suggests that the door is not entirely closed on proposals for greater market liberalisation. This includes the possibility that DEWR and other agencies may be able to source services from providers other than Centrelink. The radical experiment may not be over yet.
