5|$|Offa's wife Cynethryth was {{the only}} Anglo-Saxon queen ever named or portrayed on coinage– <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> series of pennies struck by the moneyer Eoba. These were {{probably}} derived from contemporary coins from {{the reign of the}} Byzantine emperor Constantine VI, who minted a series showing a portrait of his mother, the later Empress Irene, though the Byzantine coins show a frontal bust of Irene rather than a profile, and so cannot have been a direct model.|$|E

25|$|For {{the early}} part of his career, Carter was {{somewhat}} overshadowed by his more illustrious teammates Len Coldwell and Jack Flavell, but nevertheless managed to make many appearances, especially when his England teammates were injured or engaged on Test duties. In 1965, the year in which he was capped, he turned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> performance against Lancashire. Having come into the team in place of Coldwell, who had been injured, in the second innings Carter returned an analysis of 4.1–2–7–6, including a hat-trick, as Lancashire were dismissed for 55.|$|E
25|$|The {{tension between}} Soviet Union and Russian SFSR {{authorities}} {{came to be}} personified in the bitter power struggle between Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. Squeezed out of Union politics by Gorbachev in 1987, Yeltsin, who represented himself as a committed democrat, presented a significant opposition to Gorbachev authority. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> reversal of fortunes, he gained election {{as chairman of the}} Russian republic's new Supreme Soviet in May 1990. The following month, he secured legislation giving Russian laws priority over Soviet laws and withholding two-thirds of the budget. In the first Russian presidential election in 1991 Yeltsin became president of the Russian SFSR.|$|E

Stuart was banned from bowling {{for the remainder of the}} innings by umpire John Hampshire after delivering two high, fast full-tosses (called as no-balls) in his first three balls. Chris Gayle completed the last three balls of the over with his off-breaks. It was the only instance in Test cricket history, when three bowlers were used in completing one over.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Colorado Governor Lee Knous {{issued a}} {{proclamation}} {{to create a}} memorial to Colorado's servicemen at the University of Colorado Boulder. A proposal to house this memorial in a student union building resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> fundraising effort. The University Memorial Center opened its doors in October 1953 with President Robert Stearns presiding over the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The UMC quickly became the central landmark of the Boulder campus. A 1964 addition created a new book store, conference facilities, additional dining facilities, and offices to house the rapidly growing student activities and organizations. The expansion was financed through bonds granted by student fees.|$|E
25|$|Without a {{significant}} post presence, the Bulls struggled {{for most of}} the 2005–06 season. However, a late-season 12–2 surge allowed them to finish 41–41 and qualify for the 2006 playoffs as the seventh seed. There, the Bulls faced the Miami Heat. After two close losses in Miami, the Bulls broke through with a blowout win in Game 3, and another win in Game 4. However, the Heat took the next two games to win the series and went on to win that year's championship. The Bulls' several young players nevertheless earned additional postseason experience, and Nocioni turned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> series of performances that far exceeded his season averages.|$|E

25|$|The third Test at Old Trafford Cricket Ground {{was remarkably}} {{successful}} for Jones, {{as he picked}} up the wickets of Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne, Michael Clarke, Jason Gillespie, and Brett Lee, as he collected figures of 6–53, his best bowling innings, before adding the wicket of Michael Clarke, in which Jones bowled a reverse-swinging delivery which Clarke left, expecting the ball to swing away, before it moved back towards the batsman and uprooted his off-stump.. This took his match figures to 7–110, his personal best. The match finished <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> draw, as the Australians finished the 5th day just 52 runs behind, and with one wicket remaining.|$|E
25|$|Although we {{can find}} remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century (Sant Vicenç d'Enclar or Església de Santa Coloma), Andorra {{developed}} exquisite Romanesque Art during the 9th through 14th centuries, {{as much in the}} construction of churches, bridges, religious murals and statues of the Virgin and Child (being the most important the Our Lady of Meritxell). Nowadays, the Romanesque buildings that form part of Andorra's cultural heritage stand out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> way, with an emphasis on Església de Sant Esteve, Sant Joan de Caselles, Església de Sant Miquel d'Engolasters, Sant Martí de la Cortinada and the medieval bridges of Margineda and Escalls among many others.|$|E

25|$|Braund's proper career {{starts from}} 1901, {{and in his}} first full season he scored more than 1,000 runs and took over 100 wickets. He scored 107 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> match at Headingley when Somerset, 238 behind Yorkshire on the first innings, put up 630 in the second innings and won the match by 279 runs, Braund taking four wickets as the home team {{collapsed}} to 113 all out in the second innings. It was Yorkshire's only defeat of the season, and Somerset repeated that feat in 1902, a closer match won by just 34 runs in which Braund took 15 wickets for 71 runs, including a career-best nine for 41 in the second innings.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> mistake, Muller left Laroche's {{division}} at Mannheim {{on the east}} bank. Laroche understood very well that his division was badly exposed. He {{would have liked to}} defend the position of Neckerau but it had no bridge, while Mannheim had a bridge. He finally turned to Ney for advice, who suggested moving the bridge to Neckerau. On 18 September, Charles with 22,000 troops assaulted Laroche who had only 5,200 soldiers. Even so, the French resisted stoutly. Ney brought some of his troops to help, but the Austrians overran Neckerau on Laroche's right and drove for the bridge. In the end, the Austrians almost managed to cross to the west bank by the bridge, but were finally stopped.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixth}} ODI of the NatWest Series 2007–2008, he scored 47 off 33 balls to take India to a thrilling victory, keeping Indian hopes {{alive in the}} 7- match series which they were {{trailing}} 2–3 before the match. Used to batting as an opener, in this match he came in at the unfamiliar position of no 7. When he came at the crease India were 5 down for 234 after 40.2 overs, still needing 83 from less than 10 overs. After Dhoni got out in the 47th over with the Indian score at 294, Uthappa kept a cool head to take India to the target with two balls to spare <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> victory.|$|E
