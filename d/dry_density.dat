50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, he finally created a {{solution}} for determining the maximum density of soils. Ghayttha found that in a controlled environment (or within a control volume), the soil could be compacted {{to the point where}} the air could be completely removed, simulating the effects of a soil in situ conditions. From this, the <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> could be determined by simply measuring the weight of the soil before and after compaction, calculating the moisture content, and furthermore calculating the <b>dry</b> <b>density.</b> Ralph R. Proctor went on to teach at the University of Arkansas.|$|E
50|$|The Proctor {{compaction}} test is a laboratory method of experimentally determining the optimal moisture content {{at which a}} given soil type will become most dense and achieve its maximum <b>dry</b> <b>density.</b> The term Proctor is in honor of R. R. Proctor, who in 1933 showed that the <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> of a soil for a given compactive effort depends {{on the amount of}} water the soil contains during soil compaction. His original test is most commonly referred to as the standard Proctor {{compaction test}}; later on, his test was updated to create the modified Proctor compaction test.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{vulnerability}} to cavitation, P 50 (i. e. the water potential causing 50 % loss of hydraulic conductivity), of Norway spruce trunkwood at different cambial age {{was related to}} wood density. Wood density was calculated from mass in the oven dry state related either to volume at the oven-dry state (<b>dry</b> wood <b>density)</b> or to volume at full saturation (basic wood <b>density).</b> <b>Dry</b> wood <b>density</b> and basic wood density were strongly linearly related (r² = 0. 99); there was however a shift from the 1 : 1 reference line with increasing <b>dry</b> wood <b>density.</b> <b>Dry</b> wood <b>density</b> as well as basic wood density had similar high predictive qualities for P 50 (r² = 0. 85). The quadratic regression lines took however a quite different course below- 4 MPa because volume shrinkage increased with increasing <b>dry</b> wood <b>density.</b> For Norway spruce sapwood with high <b>dry</b> wood <b>density,</b> mixing up different wood density traits would thus result in a predicted overestimation or underestimation of {{vulnerability to}} cavitation. Gravimetrically wood density measurements at different moisture contents (starting at full saturation) are easily to achieve on standard size specimens and the conversion curves obtained will be of high value for future ecological studies on other species and across species...|$|R
50|$|These {{laboratory}} tests generally consist of compacting soil at known moisture content into a cylindrical mold of standard dimensions using a compactive effort of controlled magnitude. The soil is usually compacted {{into the mold}} to {{a certain amount of}} equal layers, each receiving a number of blows from a standard weighted hammer at a specified height. This process is then repeated for various moisture contents and the dry densities are determined for each. The graphical relationship of the <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> to moisture content is then plotted to establish the compaction curve. The maximum <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> is finally obtained from the peak point of the compaction curve and its corresponding moisture content, also known as the optimal moisture content.|$|E

50|$|Until {{a decade}} ago, foam {{concrete}} has {{been regarded as}} weak and non-durable with high shrinkage characteristics.

40|$|Monitoring {{sediment}} yields from catchments {{is important}} for assessing overall denudation rates {{and the impact of}} environmental change. One of the methods used to assess sediment yield is by quantifying sedimentation rates in reservoirs, lakes or small ponds. Before reliable sediment yield values (t ha(- 1) a(- 1)) can be computed from such sedimentation records, the measured sediment volumes need to be converted to sediment masses using representative values of the <b>dry</b> sediment bulk <b>density.</b> In textbooks, simple relations predicting <b>dry</b> sediment bulk <b>density</b> from sediment texture, time since deposition and hydrologic condition are presented. In this study, 13 small flood retention ponds in central Belgium were sampled to reveal the variability in <b>dry</b> sediment bulk <b>density</b> and to test the commonly used relations to predict <b>dry</b> sediment bulk <b>density.</b> <b>Dry</b> sediment bulk <b>density</b> varies not only between the selected ponds (0. 78 - 1. 35 t m(- 3)) but also within individual ponds (coefficient of variation at 95 per cent ranges from 7 to 80 per cent). The observed variability can be attributed primarily to the hydrologic condition of the retention pond and, also, to sediment texture. The existing relations are not a reliable predictor for the observed <b>dry</b> bulk <b>densities,</b> because they are primarily based on sediment texture. Thus, when using volumetric sedimentation data from small ponds with varying hydrologic condition to predict sediment yield, existing relations predicting <b>dry</b> sediment bulk <b>density</b> cannot be applied.

40|$|AbstractThe {{bentonite}} {{barrier of}} underground repositories for {{high-level radioactive waste}} will be hydrated by the groundwater while it is subjected to high temperatures due to the radioactive decay of the wastes. These changes of temperature affect the hydraulic and mechanical responses of bentonite, which has important effects on design and performance of repositories. The temperature influence on the hydro-mechanical behaviour of bentonite was studied in this paper by experiments, which were carried out with the Spanish FEBEX bentonite compacted at <b>dry</b> <b>densities</b> expected in the repository (from 1. 5 to 1. 8 Mg/m 3). The dependence of the swelling strains of bentonite on the temperature has been measured from 30 °C to 90 °C. At high temperatures the swelling capacity of clay slightly decreases. Also, a clear decrease of swelling pressure {{as a function of}} temperature was observed for the same <b>dry</b> <b>densities.</b> Nevertheless, the deformation of bentonite is more dependent on the stress than the temperature. An increase in the permeability of water saturated bentonite with temperature has also been detected. The water retention curves of bentonite compacted at different <b>dry</b> <b>densities</b> were determined under isochoric conditions and in the range of temperatures from 20 °C to 120 °C. For a given density and water content, the suction decreases as the temperature increases at a rate, which is larger than the one predicted on the basis of water surface tension changing with temperature. Mechanisms related to the physico-chemical interactions that take place at microscopic level, in particular the transfer of interlayer water to the macropores triggered by temperature, seem to explain qualitatively the experimental observations...|$|R
