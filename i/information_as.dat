5|$|Data Recorders – These {{are often}} placed in {{ambulances}} to record such <b>information</b> <b>as</b> speed, braking power and time, activation of active emergency warnings such as lights and sirens, {{as well as}} seat belt usage. These are often used in coordination with GPS units.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as an {{automated}} electronic log book. An ELD records the same <b>information</b> <b>as</b> a manual paper log book, and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.|$|E

5|$|The Forbes {{magazine}} methodology was {{to calculate}} a five-year {{return on investment}} for 2002 graduates.

40|$|A vast body of {{research}} has shown information science to be a social science, but <b>information</b> science’s identity <b>as</b> both a social science and a non-social science has become all the more uncertain, or simply has been left to {{the discretion of the}} reader. Method. This paper traces the specifics of <b>information</b> science <b>as</b> a social science. The paper examines the background of the social sciences in the history of academic disciplines. The paper discusses the ways in which positivism and interpretativism, the leading traditions of the social sciences, assert themselves in <b>information</b> science <b>as</b> a social science. Conclusions. It is argued that received ideas about the social sciences impact how <b>information</b> science <b>as</b> a social science is perceived. It is also argued that <b>information</b> science <b>as</b> a social science can and should provide valid scientific explanations. This paper distinguishes social interaction as the defining feature of <b>information</b> science <b>as</b> a social science. To this end, the paper proposes global complexity not as a theory or solution, but as a metaphor for <b>information</b> science <b>as</b> a social science to address the pressing issues of our increasingly interconnected world...|$|R
50|$|Semantic memory {{refers to}} {{knowledge}} about factual <b>information,</b> such <b>as</b> {{the meaning of}} words. Semantic memory is independent <b>information</b> such <b>as</b> <b>information</b> remembered for a test. In contrast with episodic memory, older adults and younger adults do not show {{much of a difference}} in semantic memory, presumably because semantic memory does not depend on context memory.|$|R
5000|$|For example, in a {{comparison}} of products, <b>information</b> such <b>as</b> price or weight can be conveyed numerically, and binary <b>information</b> such <b>as</b> the existence or lack of a feature can be conveyed with a check mark; however, <b>information</b> such <b>as</b> [...] "quality" [...] or [...] "safety" [...] or [...] "taste" [...] {{is often difficult to}} summarize in a manner allowing easy comparison - thus, Harvey Balls are used.|$|R

5|$|After {{attempts}} to persuade Muchlisin {{to keep the}} original design fail, Sakera overhears that the house is on disputed land. Maida uses the <b>information,</b> <b>as</b> well as feedback from a traditional musical group distantly related to Pahing, {{to discover that the}} house has a secret underground bunker, in which she and Sakera– with whom she has begun to fall in love– find documents showing the history of the house.

5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this <b>information,</b> <b>as</b> well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{manifesto}} was published, the FBI held many {{press conferences}} asking {{the public to}} help identify the Unabomber. They were convinced that the bomber was from the Chicago area (where he began his bombings), had worked or had some connection in Salt Lake City, and by the 1990s {{was associated with the}} San Francisco Bay Area. This geographical <b>information,</b> <b>as</b> well as the wording in excerpts from the manifesto that were released before the entire manifesto was published, persuaded David Kaczynski's wife, Linda, to urge her husband to read the manifesto.|$|E

5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic <b>information</b> <b>as</b> their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, many were {{relieved}} {{to have survived}} {{the worst of the}} Category4 hurricane; their complacency turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of <b>information,</b> <b>as</b> every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days. Because Iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island, communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers. Though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed, many Kauai citizens insisted on paying. In addition, entertainers from all of Hawaii, including Graham Nash (who owns a home on the north shore of Kauaʻi) and the Honolulu Symphony, provided free concerts to the victims.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a calculation which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This work extended previous results of Jacob Bekenstein who had suggested that black holes have a well defined entropy. At first, Hawking's result appeared to contradict {{one of the main}} postulates of quantum mechanics, namely the unitarity of time evolution. Intuitively, the unitarity postulate says that quantum mechanical systems do not destroy <b>information</b> <b>as</b> they evolve from one state to another. For this reason, the apparent contradiction {{came to be known as}} the black hole information paradox.|$|E

5|$|In a paper {{published}} in Nature in January 2013, {{scientists from the}} European Bioinformatics Institute and Agilent Technologies proposed a mechanism to use DNA's ability to code <b>information</b> <b>as</b> a means of digital data storage. The group was able to encode 739 kilobytes of data into DNA code, synthesize the actual DNA, then sequence the DNA and decode the information back to its original form, with a reported 100% accuracy. The encoded information consisted of text files and audio files. A prior experiment was {{published in}} August 2012. It was conducted by researchers at Harvard University, where the text of a 54,000-word book was encoded in DNA.|$|E
5|$|It {{is still}} not certain how many people died on the inner German border or who they all were, as the GDR treated such <b>information</b> <b>as</b> a closely guarded secret.

5|$|Levels contain many {{different}} environment types, including cities, forests, and bogs.

This narration gives scripted plot <b>information</b> <b>as</b> well as dynamic comments, such as on the player's skill with a weapon or performance while fighting enemies.|$|E
