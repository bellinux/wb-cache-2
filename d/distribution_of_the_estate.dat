6000|$|But to proceed. With {{regard to}} the title of these ladies, {{according}} to the Mahometan law, you have nothing laid before you by the prisoner's counsel but a quotation cut out with the scissors from a Mahometan law-book, (which I suspect very much the learned gentlemen have never read through,) declaring how a Mahometan's effects are to be distributed. But Mr. Hastings could not at the time have consulted that learned counsel who now defends him upon {{the principles of the}} Hedaya, the Hedaya not having been then published in English; and I will venture to say, that neither Sir Elijah Impey nor Ali Ibrahim Khân, nor any other person, high or low, in India, ever suggested this defence, and that it was never thought of till lately found by the learned counsel in the English translation of the Hedaya. [...] "God bless me!" [...] now says Mr. Hastings, [...] "what ignorance have I been in all this time! I thought I was seizing this unjustly, and that the pretence of rebellion was necessary; but my counsel have found out a book, since published, and from it they produce the law upon that subject, and show that the Nabob had a right to seize upon the treasures of his mother." [...] But are your Lordships so ignorant--(your Lordships are not ignorant of anything)--are any men so ignorant as not to know that in every country the common law of <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> of an intestate amongst private individuals is no rule with {{regard to the}} family arrangements of great princes? Is any one ignorant, that, from the days of the first origin of the Persian monarchy, the laws of which have become rules ever since for almost all the monarchs of the East, the wives of great men have had, independent of the common distribution of their goods, great sums of money and great estates in land, one for their girdle, one for their veil, and so on, going through the rest of their ornaments and attire,--and that they held great estates and other effects over which the reigning monarch or his successor had no control whatever? Indeed, my Lords, a more curious and extraordinary species of trial than this of a question of right never was heard of since the world began. Mr. Hastings begins with seizing the goods of the Begums at Fyzabad, nine thousand miles from you, and fourteen years after tries the title in an English court, without having one person to appear for these miserable ladies. I trust you will not suffer this mockery; I hope this last and ultimate shame will be spared us: for I declare to God, that the defence, and the principles of it, appear to me ten thousand times worse than the act itself.|$|E

50|$|The {{petition}} {{was initiated}} by the German Communist Party (KPD), who were then joined, with some reluctance, by the Social Democrats (SPD). It {{was not only the}} KPD and SPD voters who supported expropriation without compensation. Many supporters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Centre Party and the German Democratic Party (DDP) were also in favour. In some regions voters of conservative national parties also supported expropriation.

50|$|For example, if {{a person}} dies intestate, the laws of some jurisdictions require <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> to the deceased's spouse or children. However, if there are none of these, the estate can often be {{distributed}} to the next closest group of living relatives, whether they be parents, grandparents, first cousins, aunts and uncles, or second cousins in extreme cases. If a person dies intestate with no identifiable next of kin, the person's estate generally escheats (i.e., legally reverts) to the government.|$|E
50|$|If the {{deceased}} is {{married at the}} time of his death, the property system that applies to his marriage is of utmost importance since it affects the distribution of {{the deceased}}’s estate. In terms of the Recognition of Matrimonial Property Act, the first marriage of a male with more than one wife is always considered to be in community of property. If a second marriage is entered into, the parties must enter into an antenuptial contract, which will regulate the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate.</b>|$|E
50|$|This Act makes {{provision}} {{for a court}} to vary (and extend when appropriate) the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> of a deceased person to any spouse, former spouse, child, child of the family or dependant of that person {{in cases where the}} deceased person's will or the standard rules of intestacy fail to make reasonable financial provision.

500|$|Ludlow Castle {{gradually}} became the Mortimer family's most important property, but for much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century its owners {{were too young}} to control the castle personally. The castle was first briefly inherited by Mortimer's son, Edmund, and then in 1331 Mortimer's young grandson, Roger, who eventually became a prominent soldier in the Hundred Years War. Roger's young son, Edmund, inherited the castle in 1358, and also grew up to become involved in the war with France. Both Roger and Edmund used a legal device called [...] "the use", effectively giving Ludlow Castle to trustees during their lifetimes in exchange for annual payments; this reduced their tax liabilities and gave them more control over <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> on their deaths. Edmund's son, another Roger, inherited the castle in 1381, but King Richard II took <b>the</b> opportunity <b>of</b> Roger's minority to exploit <b>the</b> Mortimer <b>estates</b> until they were put into <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> a committee of major nobles.

50|$|According to the {{customary}} law of succession, an heir did not merely succeed to {{the assets of}} the deceased. This was because succession was concerned not primarily with the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> of the deceased, but rather with the preservation and perpetuation of the family unit. Property was collectively owned, and the family head, who was the nominal owner of the property, administered it {{for the benefit of the}} family unit as a whole. The heir stepped into the shoes of the family head and acquired all the rights and became subject to all the obligations of the family head. Family members under the guardianship of the deceased fell under the guardianship of his heir, and the latter in turn acquired the duty to maintain and support all the members of the family, who were assured of his protection and enjoyed the benefit of the heir's maintenance and support. He inherited the property of the deceased only in the sense that he assumed control and administration of the property, subject to his rights and obligations as head of the family unit.|$|E

As one of the most trusted merchants of the king, Olof made a fortune, and as one of the most prominent burghers in the city, he was appointed magistrate, member of a court of first instance, head of the goldsmith guild, and churchwarden at the Cathedral. Skeppar Olof died in 1555 and is buried in the cathedral (which he saved from the king's plans to demolish it). One of the many buildings he owned was located between the alley and Österlånggatan, in 1528 referred to as Schepar Olofz huus i Olof Grelsons gränd ("House of Skipper Olof in the alley of Olof Grelson"), and in 1597 subject to his widow's <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate.</b> [...] The skipper in question might have lived in the medieval building on the right side directly after the vault.|$|E
5000|$|In 1910, Thornhill {{gained control}} of the land after a decade long legal battle with his mother. Thornhill contended that {{ownership}} of the land should be passed down and distributed amongst himself and his siblings Montague Watson Broome and Amy Lillian Broome. These appeals {{found their way to}} the Superior Courts of California where the courts had to consider a number of questions. [...] "(1) whether the court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the cause, appellant contending in this behalf that neither the complaint nor the lis pendens adequately described the property; (2) whether the trial court erred in finding that the services rendered by plaintiff's counsel were for the common benefit of all the parties to the action; (3) whether the decree of partial distribution entered in the estate of William Francis Broome, deceased, whereunder the plaintiff and the nonappealing defendants, Montague Watson Broome and Amy Lillian Broome, claim as tenants in common an interest in the land subjected to partition can be availed of as muniment of title; and, finally, (4) whether the court erred in failing to find upon the issue that the action was prematurely instituted presented by an allegation of the answer to the effect that the partial decree of <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> of the testator to the parties to the action had not become final before the date of the filing of the complaint in the action." [...] On November 29 in 1910, Thornhill Francis Broome, filed in the estate of William Richard Broome, deceased, his petition for a partial distribution and in 1909 on August 4, the defendant Frances Broome had jointly with the defendants Montague Watson Broome and Amy Lillian Broome, filed a petition for the partial <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> as well. The petitions of the defendant were denied because there was [...] "no provision in the last will and testament of the said deceased for distribution to said defendants save in a manner prohibited by law." [...] Early in 1911 Thornhill Francis, Frances, Montague, and Amy Broome resubmitted a joint stipulation and on June 30, 1911 it was ruled that the plaintiff Thornhill Francis Broome and the defendants Montague Watson Broome and Amy Lillian Broome were entitled to partial distribution of the property. Lady Frances Broome was denied access except to those properties specifically bequeathed to her in her husband's will. She would soon after claim fraud and that [...] "relying upon the terms of said stipulation she was imposed upon and misled to the extent that she did not take or prosecute any appeal from said decree of partial distribution." [...] It was determined that there was not enough evidence which [...] "neither singly nor collectively sufficed" [...] to make a satisfactory case for the showing of fraud. Upon Thornhill Francis Broome's death, the land transferred ownership to his son, John Spoor Broome.|$|E
