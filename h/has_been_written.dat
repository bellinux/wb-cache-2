50|$|The perfect {{aspect is}} {{expressed}} with {{a form of}} the auxiliary have together with the past participle of the verb. Thus the present perfect <b>is</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> or has written, and the past perfect (pluperfect) <b>is</b> <b>had</b> <b>written.</b> The perfect can combine with the progressive aspect (see above) to produce the present perfect progressive (continuous) have/has <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> and the past perfect progressive (continuous) <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing.</b> There <b>is</b> a perfect infinitive (to) have written and a perfect progressive infinitive (to) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing,</b> and corresponding present participle/gerund forms <b>having</b> <b>written</b> and <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing.</b> A perfect subjunctive (<b>have</b> <b>written)</b> <b>is</b> also sometimes used.

In March 2012, Bacall gave an update on the long-rumored Les Grossman spin-off movie, revealing that the film will attempt to uncover where Grossman's well-documented anger issues originated.|$|E
5|$|Female {{sexuality}} {{is often not}} adequately represented in texts and documents. Until very recently, much {{of what has been}} documented about women's sexuality <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> by men, in the context of male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men—as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E
5|$|Mongolian <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> in {{a variety}} of alphabets, making it a {{language}} with one of the largest number of scripts used historically. The earliest stages of Mongolian (Xianbei, Wuhuan languages) may have used an indigenous runic script as indicated by Chinese sources. The Khitan large script adopted in 920 CE is an early Mongol (or according to some, para-Mongolic) script.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the text}} {{mentions}} Justin Martyr's First Apology, which <b>was</b> <b>written</b> sometime between 150-155 CE, Dialogue with Trypho must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> after it. The date of authorship <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suggested to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> anywhere between 155-167, with some scholars favoring 155-160, {{or even the}} specific date of 160.|$|R

This element of Candide <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> about voluminously, perhaps above all others. The conclusion is enigmatic and its analysis is contentious.|$|E
5|$|The green rosella has a {{repeated}} two-syllable contact call, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> as kussik kussik or cossack cossack and is heard in flight.

5|$|After the shootout in Tombstone, {{his pursuit}} {{and murder of}} those who {{attacked}} his brothers, and after leaving Arizona, Wyatt was often the target of negative newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers' reputation. His role in history has stimulated considerable ongoing scholarly and editorial debate. A large body of literature <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> about Wyatt Earp and his legacy, some of it highly fictionalized. Considerable portions of it are either full of admiration and flattery or hostile debunking.|$|E
5|$|At {{the present}} {{there are many}} debates going on in Sri Lanka {{questioning}} {{the accuracy of the}} Buddhagosha's work. This is because of the changes in Vissuddhimagga from the original scripts. As indicated by the monastic S.Dhammika, Buddhagosha had not attained any state of Nibbana (sowan, sakrudhagami, anagami or arhath) but wished to be reborn in heaven. Therefore, it is not advisable to follow these texts rather than the pure original scripts of Dhamma which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> by Arhaths.|$|E
5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding and raising offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> {{about the level}} of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on her chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E

5|$|From {{the classic}} {{language}} {{to the present}} day, a body of literature <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> in Mayan languages. The earliest texts to have been preserved are largely monumental inscriptions documenting rulership, succession, and ascension, conquest and calendrical and astronomical events. It is likely that other kinds of literature were written in perishable media such as codices made of bark, only four of which have survived the ravages {{of time and the}} campaign of destruction by Spanish missionaries.|$|E
5|$|When {{adopting}} {{new concepts}} or technologies, Greenlandic usually constructs new words made from Greenlandic roots, but modern Greenlandic has also taken many loans from Danish and English. The language <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> in the Latin script since Danish colonization {{began in the}} 1700s. The first orthography was developed by Samuel Kleinschmidt in 1851, but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because {{of a number of}} sound changes. An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in Greenlandic literacy, which is now {{among the highest in the}} world.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> with {{a number}} of {{different}} writing systems. The Hebrews adopted the Phoenician alphabet around the 12th centuryBCE, which developed into the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. This was retained by the Samaritans, who use the descendent Samaritan alphabet to this day. However, the Aramaic alphabet gradually displaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet for the Jews, and it became the source for the modern Hebrew alphabet. All of these scripts were lacking letters to represent all of the sounds of Biblical Hebrew, though these sounds are reflected in Greek and Latin transcriptions/translations of the time. These scripts originally only indicated consonants, but certain letters, known by the Latin term matres lectionis, became increasingly used to mark vowels. In the Middle Ages, various systems of diacritics were developed to mark the vowels in Hebrew manuscripts; of these, only the Tiberian vocalization is still in wide use.|$|E

It would probably not be common knowledge for a few years, so it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> after 1346.|$|R
5|$|Details of Evans’ {{early life}} are unknown, {{apart from his}} birth date. No book <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> about him, {{although}} he wrote his memoirs, Living The Beatles' Legend, from which extracts were released on 20 March 2005. What is known about him starts in 1961, when Evans married a Liverpool girl, Lily, after meeting her at a funfair in New Brighton opposite Liverpool on the Wirral. Their first child, Gary, {{was born in the}} same year. The Beatles were the resident group at Liverpool's Cavern Club when Evans first heard them perform during his lunch break. He was then living in Hillside Road, Mossley Hill and working as a telephone engineer for the Post Office. He became a committed fan, even though his musical hero at the time was Elvis Presley.|$|E
5|$|Khmer {{differs from}} {{neighboring}} languages such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese {{in that it}} is not a tonal language. Words are stressed on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a minor syllable. The language <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> in the Khmer script, an abugida descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script, since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's {{enduring}} {{popularity is}} linked to her conflicted public image. On the one hand, she remains a sex symbol, beauty icon {{and one of the}} most famous stars of classical Hollywood cinema. On the other, she is also remembered for her troubled private life, unstable childhood, struggle for professional respect, and her death and the conspiracy theories surrounding it. She <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> about by scholars and journalists interested in gender and feminism, such as Gloria Steinem, Jacqueline Rose, Molly Haskell, Sarah Churchwell, and Lois Banner. Some, such as Steinem, have viewed her as a victim of the studio system. Others, such as Haskell, Rose, and Churchwell, have instead stressed Monroe's proactive role in her career and her participation in the creation of her public persona.|$|E
