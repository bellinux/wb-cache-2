500|$|In 2012, {{the station}} had a <b>free</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> with 120 spaces, {{but this was}} {{frequently}} full by 7:30am on weekdays, leading commuters to park on local roads, prompting complaints from Backwell residents. Plans to extend the car park by 200 spaces were drawn up in 2009, with North Somerset Council describing the scheme as [...] "necessary", as the lack of spaces limited {{the number of people}} who could feasibly use the station for commuting due to Nailsea being too far from the station to be an easy walk, causing people to drive to the station. That peak passengers filled the car park then meant there are no spaces for offpeak users, limiting leisure travel. North Somerset Council approved the construction of the extension on 17 April 2012, and further approved the car park becoming pay and display - all car parks in Nailsea had previously been free. Work began in January 2014, and was completed in June the same year - 162 additional car parking spaces were created, drainage was improved and CCTV was installed. The scheme, which cost £700,000, came in £50,000 under budget and was paid for using money from the Local Transport Plan and Community Infrastructure Levy. Parking prices were raised in 2017 to equalise the cost with Yatton railway station, and thus dissuade people from driving from Yatton to Nailsea for cheaper parking.|$|E

40|$|Municipalities and {{employers}} in the U. S. {{attempt to reduce}} commuting by automo-bile through commuter benefits for riding public transportation, walking, or cycling. Many employers provide a combination of benefits, often including <b>free</b> <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> alongside benefits for public transportation, walking, and cycling. This study evalu-ates the relationship between commuter benefits and mode choice for the commute to work using revealed preference data on 4, 630 regular commuters, including infor-mation about <b>free</b> <b>car</b> <b>parking,</b> public transportation benefits, showers/lockers, and bike parking {{at work in the}} Washington, DC region. Multinomial logistic regression results show that <b>free</b> <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> at work is related to more driving. Commuters offered either public transportation benefits, showers/lockers, or bike <b>parking,</b> but no <b>free</b> <b>car</b> <b>parking,</b> are more likely to either ride public transportation, walk, or cycle to work. The joint provision of benefits for public transportation, walking, and cycling is related to an increased likelihood to commute by all three of these modes and a decreased likelihood of driving. However, the inclusion of <b>free</b> <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> in benefit packages alongside benefits for public transportation, walking, and cycling, seems t...|$|R
