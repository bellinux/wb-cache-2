5|$|After {{a lengthy}} battle between {{supporters}} of the University of Houston, led by school president A.D. Bruce, and forces from state universities <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> block the change, Senate Bill 2 was passed on May 23, 1961, enabling the university to enter the state system in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The {{visitor center}} {{is located in}} the Furnace Creek resort area on State Route 190. A 12-minute {{introductory}} slide program is shown every 30minutes. During the winter season—November through April—rangers offer interpretive tours and a wide variety of walks, talks, and slide presentations about Death Valley cultural and natural history. The visitor center has displays dealing with the park's geology, climate, wildlife and natural history. There are also specific sections dealing with the human history and pioneer experience. The Death Valley Natural History Association maintains a bookstore specifically <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> the natural and cultural history of the park.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E
5000|$|Parking: Unlike an {{automatic}} car, the P gear is absent in a MMT car. The car should be {{parked in the}} following fashion. In an up-sloping incline, put the <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> M1, or E, apply handbrake, and switch off the engine. In a down-sloping incline, put the <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> R, apply handbrake, and switch off the engine. On level ground, put the <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> R, apply handbrake, and switch off the engine. R or E/M1 substitute the P function in a full automatic.|$|R
5000|$|L/1 and 2 gears {{in a full}} automatic: The MMT {{does not}} provide L/1 and 2 gears as in a full automatic. One action of the MMT system is that it detects the {{gradient}} of the slope that the car is situated in. On a down-sloping incline and if the brake pedal is depressed, it automatically selects a lower <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> produce engine brake, which has the equivalent effect of L and 2 gears in a full automatic. L and 2 can also be substituted with E1 and E2 (not available in Aygo) or M1 and M2 gears in a MMT car. To select E1 or E2, put the <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> E, and use + and - pedal flaps {{on the steering wheel}} to override the computer selection. E will change to E1/E2/E3/E4/E5/E6, depending on the <b>gear</b> selected. Downshift <b>to</b> E1 or E2 as appropriate to simulate L and 2 gears in a full automatic. To select M1 or M2, put the <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> M, and use M- <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> downshift the <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> M1 or M2.|$|R

5|$|The {{question}} now became {{how to provide}} this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six twelve-battalion infantry divisions with supporting arms. They {{would need to be}} organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent. Because the Army was now <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> a specific purpose, it could be reorganised to fit this role, and any elements which did not support it could be discarded. These reforms anticipated that the existing tripartite division of the Armythe Regular Army, the Volunteers/Yeomanry and the Militiashould be changed into a two-part structure, with an Expeditionary Force and a home-defence Territorial Force based on County Associations. The Volunteers and Yeomanry would form the basis for the Territorial Force, whilst the Militia would be used as a reserve for the all-Regular Expeditionary Force, fully liable for service overseas.|$|E
