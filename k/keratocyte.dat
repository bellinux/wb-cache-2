40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} acute inflammation in <b>keratocyte</b> death, which may influence corneal haze after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). METHODS. Transepithelial PRK was performed on both eyes of 30 rabbits. Twenty-six rabbits were divided into 4 groups receiving autologous blood, suturing alone, suturing with amniotic membrane graft, or no treatment as the control. Twenty-four hours later, the ablated zone was analyzed for <b>keratocyte</b> death by TdT-dUTP terminal nick-end label (TUNEL) staining and transmission electron microscopy, for polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) infiltration by hematoxylin–eosin staining, and for oxygen radical–induced lipid peroxidation by malondialdehyde immunohistochemistry. The remaining four rabbits were subjected to PRK or mechanical scraping and analyzed immediately or after culturing for 24 hours. RESULTS. Compared with the control group where TUNEL-positive keratocytes were found only in the superficial ablated stroma, blood application or suturing caused more and deeper <b>keratocyte</b> death and PMN infiltration (P � 0. 05). The amniotic membrane graft group had less <b>keratocyte</b> death and PMN than the control or the suture group (P � 0. 05 and P � 0. 01, respectively). There was {{a strong correlation between}} <b>keratocyte</b> death and PMN infiltration (P � 0. 01, correlation factor � 0. 786).

Differentiating the cMSC back to a <b>keratocyte</b> phenotype using non-supplemented, serum-free medium restored <b>keratocyte</b> markers but did not maintain cell viability or support corneal extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Supplementing the differentiation medium with combinations of fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF- 2), transforming growth factor-β 3 (TGF-β 3) and retinoic acid (RA) maintained viability, restored expression of CD 34, ALDH 3 A 1 and keratocan, and facilitated production of abundant ECM as shown by immunofluorescent staining for collagen-I and lumican, alongside quantitative assays for collagen and glycosaminoglycan production.

40|$|The corneal {{wound healing}} {{response}} involves the activation of keratocytes to proliferate from a quiescent phenotype. The mitogens {{that cause the}} initial transformation of the quiescent keratocytes to the active phenotype have not been identified. Even though serum is commonly used to replicate this in vitro, the cornea is avascular and therefore likely not exposed to serum. In {{the first part of}} this dissertation, a DMEM/F 12 extract of corneal stromas was made and shown to stimulate <b>keratocyte</b> proliferation in both a dose-dependent and cell-density dependent manner. This extract contains mitogens that differ from the mitogens present in serum based on their effect on keratocytes and their biochemical characteristics. Culture in extract replicates in vitro the changes observed during the activation of keratocytes in the wound-healing phase. The corneal stroma contains an extensive extracellular matrix that consists primarily of collagens and proteolgycans. This matrix is maintained and secreted by the keratocytes, cells with unique characteristics lost during the activation observed at wound healing. The second part of this dissertation aims to develop a defined culture medium that maintains the <b>keratocyte</b> phenotype during proliferation. Keratocytes were cultured in serum-free medium and the effect of the growth factors on the markers for the <b>keratocyte</b> phenotype determined. Only insulin was shown to stimulate cell proliferation in a consistent manner, while maintaining commonly accepted <b>keratocyte</b> markers. When this defined culture medium was supplemented with ascorbic acid to study collagen synthesis, a marked increase in both collagen synthesis and keratan sulfate proteoglycan accumulation was measured. This newly developed culture medium, containing insulin and ascorbate, allows for cell growth, maintains the <b>keratocyte</b> markers, and could be used to study the native, non-activated <b>keratocyte</b> phenotype in culture. This dissertation shows that the culture media described herein replicate in vitro all the phenotypes observed during the corneal wound healing response in vivo. These culture media, in turn, could be used to obtain more knowledge about the different <b>keratocyte</b> phenotypes, and how they could be manipulated in culture. (329 words...|$|E
40|$|We {{sought to}} {{identify}} the anti-angiogenic molecule expressed in corneal <b>keratocytes</b> {{that is responsible for}} maintaining the avascularity of the cornea. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured with either human dermal fibroblasts or with human corneal <b>keratocytes</b> under serum-free conditions. The areas that exhibited blood vessel formation were estimated by immunostaining the cultures with an antitibody against CD 31, a blood vessel marker. We also performed microarray gene-expression analysis and selected one molecule, angiopoietin-like 7 (ANGPTL 7) for further functional studies conducted with the <b>keratocytes</b> and in vivo in mice. Areas showing blood vessel formation in normal serum-free medium were conditions were markedly smaller when HUVECs were co-cultured with corneal <b>keratocytes</b> than when they were co-cultured with the dermal fibroblasts under the same conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that ANGPTL 7 expression was higher in <b>keratocytes</b> than in dermal fibroblasts. In vitro, inhibiting ANGPTL 7 expression by using a specific siRNA led to greater tube formation than did the transfection of cells with a control siRNA, and this increase in tube formation was abolished when recombinant ANGPTL 7 protein was added to the cultures. In vivo, intrastromal injections of an ANGPTL 7 PshRNA into the avascular corneal stroma of mice resulted in the growth of blood vessels. ANGPTL 7, which is abundantly expressed in <b>keratocytes,</b> {{plays a major role in}} maintaining corneal avascularity and transparency...|$|R

The purpose of our {{study was to determine}} the impact of riboflavin-UVA photodynamic inactivation on viability, apop-tosis and activation of human <b>keratocytes</b> in vitro. Primary human <b>keratocytes</b> were isolated from human corneal buttons and cultured in DMEM/Ham 9 s F 12 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum. <b>Keratocytes</b> underwent UVA light illumination (375 nm) for 4. 10 minutes (2 J/cm 2) during exposure to different concentrations of riboflavin. Twenty-four hours after treatment, cell viability was evaluated photometrically, whereas apoptosis, CD 34 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) expression were assessed using flow cytometry. We did not detect significant changes in cell viability, apoptosis, CD 34 and a-SMA expression in groups only treated with riboflavin or UVA light. In the group treated with riboflavin-UVA-photodynamic inactivation, viability of <b>keratocytes</b> decreased significantly at 0. 1 % riboflavin (P, 0. 01) while the percentage of CD 34 (P, 0. 01 for both 0. 05 % and 0. 1 % riboflavin) and alpha-SMA positive <b>keratocytes</b> (P, 0. 01 and P, 0. 05 for 0. 05 % and 0. 1 % riboflavin, respectively) increased significantly compared to the controls. There was no significant change in the percentage of apoptotic <b>keratocytes</b> compared to controls at any of the used ribo-flavin concentrations (P 50. 09 and P 50. 13).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{document}} {{qualitative and}} quantitative changes in the normal, healthy human cornea with age using the confocal microscope. METHODS: The central corneas of 120 subjects (mean age, 41 years; range, 11 to 80 years) were examined using an in vivo slit-scanning real-time confocal microscope. Images of the corneal stroma and endothelium from both eyes of each subject were semiautomatically analyzed in an observer-masked, randomized manner. RESULTS: Anterior <b>keratocyte</b> density, posterior <b>keratocyte</b> density, and endothelial cell density were shown to be unaffected by {{the sex of the}} subject with p values of 0. 46, 0. 55, 0. 50, respectively (multivariate analysis of variance). No statistically significant difference was detected between right and left eyes for all corneal layers examined. The anterior <b>keratocyte</b> density, posterior <b>keratocyte</b> density, and endothelial cell density decreased at a rate of 0. 48, 0. 22, and 0. 33 % per year, respectively. A positive correlation was found between the coefficient of cell variation and age.

40|$|PURPOSE. Programmed {{cell death}} (apoptosis) is the {{controlled}} death of cells that occurs with minimal collateral damage to surrounding cells or tissue during development, homeostasis, and wound healing. The authors hypothesize that <b>keratocyte</b> apoptosis is an initiating {{factor in the}} wound-healing response after refractive surgical procedures. To evaluate the effects of different corneal manipulations, <b>keratocyte</b> apoptosis was examined qualitatively and quantitatively after traditional epithelial scrape-photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), transepithelial PRK, removal of a cap of superficial cornea using a microkeratome, production of a flap of superficial cornea with a microkeratome, and laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) compared with unwounded controls in rabbit corneas. METHODS. Refractive surgical procedures or their components were performed in rabbit eyes. <b>Keratocyte</b> apoptosis was monitored using the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick-end labeling assay to detect DNA fragmentation. Cellular morphologic changes were evaluated by electron microscope examination.

40|$|Keratocytes are fibroblast-like {{cells that}} {{maintain}} the optical clarity {{and the overall}} health of the cornea. The ability to measure precisely their density and spatial distribution in the cornea {{is important for the}} understanding of corneal healing processes and the diagnostics of some corneal disorders. A novel computerized approach to detection and counting of <b>keratocyte</b> cells from ultra high resolution optical coherence tomography (UHR-OCT) images of the human corneal stroma is presented. The corneal OCT data is first processed using a state-of-the-art despeckling algorithm to reduce the effect of speckle on detection accuracy. A thresholding strategy is then employed to allow for improved delineation of <b>keratocyte</b> cells by suppressing similarly shaped features in the data, followed by a second-order moment analysis to identify potential cell nuclei candidates. Finally, a local extrema strategy is used to refine the candidates to determine the locations and the number of <b>keratocyte</b> cells. Cell density distribution analysis was carried in 3 D UHR-OCT images of the human corneal stroma, acquired in-vivo. The cell density results obtained using the proposed novel approach correlate well with previous work on computerized <b>keratocyte</b> cell counting from confocal microscopy images of human cornea...|$|E
40|$|Ciclosporin A (CsA) {{is widely}} {{utilized}} {{for the treatment}} of inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis. The therapeutic effects of CsA are thought to be mediated via its immunosuppressive action on infiltrating lymphocytes in skin lesions. CsA and tacrolimus block T cell activation by inhibiting the phosphatase calcineurin and preventing translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of the transcription factor Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT). As calcineurin and NFAT 1 {{have been shown to be}} functionally active in cultured human <b>keratocytes,</b> expression of other NFAT family members such as NFAT- 2 and possible functional activation was investigated in human <b>keratocytes.</b> RT-PCR and Western Analysis were used to investigate the presence of NFAT- 2 mRNA and protein in human <b>keratocytes.</b> Tissue culture of human <b>keratocytes</b> and immunostaining of cells on coverslips and confocal microscopy were used to assess the degree of nuclear localisation of NFAT- 2 in cultured cells. Keratome biopsies were taken from patients with psoriasis (lesional and non-lesional skin) and normal skin and immunohistochemistry was used to assess the NFAT- 2 localisation in these biopsies using a well characterized anti-NFAT- 2 antibody. The NFAT- 2 mRNA and protein expression was demonstrated using RT-PCR and Western blotting. Moreover, the expression of NFAT- 2 in normal skin, non-lesional and lesional psoriasis showed a striking basal staining suggesting a role for NFAT- 2 in <b>keratocytes</b> proliferation. A range of cell types in the skin express NFAT- 2. The expression of NFAT- 2 in human <b>keratocytes</b> and response to different agonists provides perhaps a unique opportunity to examine the regulation, subcellular localization and kinetics of translocation of different NFATs in primary cultured human cells. In these experiments the author assessed the expression, localization of NFAT- 2 in cultured human <b>keratocytes</b> and measured the degree of nuclear localisaion of NFAT- 2 using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy and whether CsA and tacrolimus inhibit NFAT- 2 nuclear translocation. As with NFAT 1, differentiation-promoting agents that increase intracellular calcium concentration induced nuclear translocation of NFAT- 2 in cultured <b>keratocytes</b> but with different kinetics. These data provide the first evidence of that NFAT- 2 is expressed in normal skin, psoriasis and that NFAT- 2 functionally active in human <b>keratocytes</b> and that nuclear translocation of NFAT- 2 in human skin cells has different kinetics than NFAT 1 suggesting that NFAT- 2 may play an important role in regulation of <b>keratocytes</b> proliferation and differentiation at a different stage. Inhibition of this pathway in human epidermal <b>keratocytes</b> many account, in part for the therapeutic effects of CsA and tacrolimus in skin disorders such as psoriasis. Thus, supporting our previous work data that calcineurin/NFAT is functionally active not only in T cells, but in skin cells...|$|R
40|$|<b>Keratocytes,</b> the {{quiescent}} {{cells of}} the corneal stroma, {{play a crucial role}} in corneal wound healing. Neuropeptides and neurotransmitters are usually associated with neuronal signaling, but have recently been shown to be produced also by non-neuronal cells and to be involved in many cellular processes. The aim of this study was to assess the endogenous intracellular and secreted levels of the neuropeptides substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA), and of the neurotransmitters acetylcholine (ACh), catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine), and glutamate, as well as the expression profiles of their receptors, in human primary <b>keratocytes</b> in vitro and in <b>keratocytes</b> of human corneal tissue sections in situ. Cultured <b>keratocytes</b> expressed genes encoding for SP and NKA, and for catecholamine and glutamate synthesizing enzymes, as well as genes for neuropeptide, adrenergic and ACh (muscarinic) receptors. <b>Keratocytes</b> in culture produced SP, NKA, catecholamines, ACh, and glutamate, and expressed neurokinin- 1 and - 2 receptors (NK- 1 R and NK- 2 R), dopamine receptor D- 2, muscarinic ACh receptors, and NDMAR 1 glutamate receptor. Human corneal sections expressed SP, NKA, NK- 1 R, NK- 2 R, receptor D 2, choline acetyl transferase (ChAT), M- 3, M 4 and M- 5 muscarinic ACh receptors, glutamate, and NMDAR 1, but not catecholamine synthesizing enzyme or the alpha(1) and beta(2) adrenoreceptors, nor M 1 receptor. In addition, expression profiles assumed significant differences between <b>keratocytes</b> from the peripheral cornea as compared to those from the central cornea, as well as differences between <b>keratocytes</b> cultured under various serum concentrations. In conclusion, human <b>keratocytes</b> express an array of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters. The cells furthermore express receptors for neuropeptides/neurotransmitters, which suggests that they are susceptible to stimulation by these substances in the cornea, whether of neuronal or non-neuronal origin. As it has been shown that neuropeptides/neurotransmitters are involved in cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, it is possible that they play a role in corneal wound healing...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanism}} of collagen degradation by <b>keratocytes,</b> we developed the new in vitro model in which <b>keratocytes</b> were cultured three-dimensionally in a collagen matrix. Subcultured rabbit <b>keratocytes</b> were embedded in a type I collagen matrix and cul-tured in serum-free medium. Collagenolytic activity of the cells was determined by measur-ing the amount of hydroxyproline released into the medium from degraded collagen. Activi-ties of collagenase in the medium were also measured, using collagen labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate as a substrate. The presence of plasminogen was required for collagen degra-dation by <b>keratocytes.</b> In the presence of plasminogen, the amount of collagen degradation depended on both the cultivation period {{and the number of}} cells. The addition of interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) stimulated the collagen degradation in a dose-dependent manner.
