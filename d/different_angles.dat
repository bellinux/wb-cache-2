5|$|In 1666, Newton {{observed}} that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism {{in the position of}} minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by <b>different</b> <b>angles.</b> This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at <b>different</b> <b>angles</b> {{at different times}} of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate.

5|$|Recent {{photometric}} and spectroscopic {{observations from}} 2005 to 2007 {{indicate that a}} new disk has formed around the equatorthus constituting a double disk phenomenon with disks at <b>different</b> <b>angles.</b> The inclination angle of the new disk is estimated at 60° whereas the previous disk was inclined at around 30°. Such a misaligned double-disk structure has never been observed before among Be stars. Thus, Pleione provides {{a rare opportunity to}} investigate the forming process of a new disk and the consequent interaction between the two.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{was first}} observed by English scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton, and its principle – wave interference – explained by Thomas Young a century later. Young described iridescence {{as the result}} of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of thin films, combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively, while at other angles, the light interferes destructively. Different colours therefore appear at <b>different</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{brighter}} {{star of the}} Pleione binary pair, component A, is a hot type B star 190 {{times more}} luminous than the Sun. It is classified as Be star with certain distinguishing traits: periodic phase changes and a complex circumstellar environment composed of two gaseous disks at <b>different</b> <b>angles</b> to each other. The primary star rotates rapidly, close to its breakup velocity, even faster than Achernar. Although some research on the companion star has been performed, stellar characteristics of the orbiting B component are not well known.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of previsualisation tests, {{including}} {{a scene in which}} Chitti jumps on a train to save Sana, Mohan eventually decided to use the technique in 40out of the 60visual effects scenes featured in the film, consisting of 2,000takes. Further previsualisation supervision was conducted by P. C. Sanath of Firefly Creative Studios, a visual effects company based in Hyderabad. 3D storyboards were constructed using 3Danimation programs for every scene in the film and were shot from <b>different</b> <b>angles.</b> In an interview with Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu, Mohan said that all the pre-production work took one and a half years to complete.|$|E
5|$|In {{the game}} with Auburn, Tech piled up 472 yards {{on the ground in}} 84 rushes and 145 yards in the air. Guyon scored four {{touchdown}}s, and Strupper had a 65-yard touchdown run. According to the Atlanta Journal,It was not the length of the run that featured it was the brilliance of it. After getting through the first line, Stroop was tackled squarely by two secondary men, and yet he squirmed and jerked loosed from them, only to face the safety man and another Tiger, coming at him from <b>different</b> <b>angles.</b> Without checking his speed Everett knifed the two men completely, running between them and dashing on to a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from <b>different</b> <b>angles.</b> Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E
5|$|This was Chopra's first action role, and she {{was excited}} to the part, so {{she wanted to do}} all the stunts by herself. After Chopra decided to perform her own stunts, Akhtar {{revealed}} that he was happy as it gave him the scope to film the fight sequences from <b>different</b> <b>angles.</b> Rampal, in the role of Jasjit, said that he approached his character in a way similar to how Pran had played it in the original but with an emotional graph. Boman Irani, who plays DCP DeSilva, a role performed by Iftekhar in the original film, revealed that he played the role according to what suited the script, but retained some of the dignity from that film.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the series}} {{shared the same}} mockumentary style as The Office, Daniels and Schur sought to {{establish}} a slightly different tone in the camerawork of the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. For example, the documentary-style interviews with characters sometimes feature two separate angles on the same person, with footage of the two <b>different</b> <b>angles</b> intercut into a single scene for the final episode. This distinguishing technique was inspired by The Five Obstructions, a 2003 documentary by Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth, which Daniels watched {{at the suggestion of}} actor Paul Schneider. The pilot episode also makes use of the jump cut technique more often than in The Office. In one example from the pilot episode, a scene repeatedly jumps cuts to several brief clips in which Leslie seeks permission from Ron to pursue the pit project.|$|E

5|$|Iridescence, as {{explained}} by Thomas Young in 1803, is created when extremely thin films reflect {{part of the}} light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further {{part of it is}} reflected from their bottom surfaces. The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – the two sets of waves are out of phase. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at <b>different</b> <b>angles.</b> So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.|$|E
5|$|Photonic {{crystals}} can {{be formed}} in different ways. In Parides sesostris, the emerald-patched cattleheart butterfly, photonic crystals are formed of arrays of nano-sized {{holes in the}} chitin of the wing scales. The holes have a diameter of about 150 nanometres and {{are about the same}} distance apart. The holes are arranged regularly in small patches; neighbouring patches contain arrays with differing orientations. The result is that these emerald-patched cattleheart scales reflect green light evenly at <b>different</b> <b>angles</b> instead of being iridescent. In Lamprocyphus augustus, a weevil from Brazil, the chitin exoskeleton is covered in iridescent green oval scales. These contain diamond-based crystal lattices oriented in all directions to give a brilliant green coloration that hardly varies with angle. The scales are effectively divided into pixels about a micrometre wide. Each such pixel is a single crystal and reflects light in a direction different from its neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Prince Caspian was {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the UK on 17 November 2008, and on 2 December 2008 in North America. It was the top selling DVD of its release week in the U.S. taking in $54.7 million. The film {{was released}} in Australia on 27 November 2008. There were one-disc and three-disc DVD editions (two-disc only in the UK), and two-disc and three-disc Blu-ray Disc editions (two-disc only in the UK). The first two discs contain an audio commentary by Adamson, blooper reel, deleted scenes and documentaries, while the third disc contains a digital copy of the film. For the Blu-ray Disc, Circle-Vision 360° was used to allow viewers to watch the night raid from <b>different</b> <b>angles.</b> An additional disc of special features was only made available in Japan and Zavvi stores in the UK, while a separate version containing a disc of electronic press kit material was exclusive to Sanity stores in Australia. By the end of 2008, the film earned almost $71 million in DVD sales.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept was}} for the {{satellite}} to be launched ahead of its target, so that the target would come close to it. After this the Agena would be used as fuel to put the SAINT in a co-orbit with its target, and then the SAINT would locate the target using its long range radar, and jettison its Agena once it had acquired the target. Then within the next 8 to 12 minutes the SAINT's radar and orientation systems would guide it to within 39ft (12m) of the target. If a SAINT was launched from Cape Canaveral, it {{would be able to}} provide initial video of the target and data dumps to the NORAD station in Rhodesia. A full inspection of the target would take two hours, and be recorded, then sent to a ground station as soon as it came within the range of the station. It would then stay within 200ft (60m) of the target for up to two days, taking pictures and measurements at <b>different</b> <b>angles.</b> After this it would be depleted of battery power and propellant.|$|E
5|$|The {{dancing is}} {{restrained}} {{with a single}} prop: that of a solitary chair. At {{one point in the}} first segment of the video, she is filmed dancing but the camera is almost still and the motions of the dance are confined within the small range of the camera. As the screens inside the viewing booths open and close, the camera slices the shots of Madonna each with its own angle and duration. The same imagery is exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna's playbill image into <b>different</b> <b>angles.</b> There are four other men in the booths who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de Lempicka on them. Madonna at one point takes off her gloves like Rita Hayworth in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings. It collapses and she blows on her finger.|$|E
5|$|The patent {{illustrates}} a non-powered flying machine—namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance {{lies in its}} claim {{of a new and}} useful method of controlling a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to <b>different</b> <b>angles</b> on the right and left sides to achieve lateral (roll) control. The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to the patent. The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn, a technique that prevents hazardous adverse yaw, the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider. Finally, the patent describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending.|$|E
