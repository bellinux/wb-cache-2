2500|$|The song [...] "Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree" [...] ("Under the {{spreading}} chestnut tree, I sold you, and you sold me") {{was based on}} an old English song called [...] "Go no more a-rushing" [...] ("Under {{the spreading}} chestnut tree, Where <b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> upon my knee, We were as happy as could be, 'Neath the spreading chestnut tree."). The song was published as early as 1891. The song was a popular camp song in the 1920s, sung with corresponding movements (like touching your chest when you sing [...] "chest", and touching your head when you sing [...] "nut"). Glenn Miller recorded the song in 1939.|$|E
60|$|I put {{her from}} me. <b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> {{and kissed the}} hem of her {{mourning}} gown.|$|E
60|$|NAPOLEON [rising] <b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> {{in spite}} of myself. I {{compliment}} you on your impressiveness, madam.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> still <b>knelt</b> at {{her side}} in silence, and my head {{felt as if the}} vessels in it were bursting....|$|R
6000|$|... "To-morrow shall end it all. I {{can stand}} this no longer. I have prayed to you,--a mother to her daughter; I have prayed {{to you for}} mercy, and you will show me none. <b>I</b> have <b>knelt</b> to you." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I gave up all hope. There {{was no time}} to gain my {{feet and}} escape; indeed I did not wish to do so, who felt that there are some {{failures}} which can only be absolved by death. <b>I</b> just <b>knelt</b> there, waiting for the end.|$|R
60|$|We {{knelt down}} before him, or rather <b>I</b> <b>knelt,</b> for Bes threw himself flat upon his face.|$|E
60|$|All these {{questions}} swept like lightning through my brain, as <b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> by Philippa's bedside, and awaited her first word.|$|E
60|$|CONJURER. [Staring.] Immortal souls!... And I suppose if <b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> down {{to worship}} you, you {{and every one}} else would laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me go away {{alone for}} a little while," [...] I said. [...] "I shall bear it better when I have looked once more {{at the place where}} I first saw her--when <b>I</b> have <b>knelt</b> and prayed by the grave where they have laid her to rest." ...|$|R
60|$|The organist {{had played}} the little {{congregation}} {{out into the}} sunshine. Only Sir Francis Esmond, temp. Jac. <b>I.,</b> still <b>knelt</b> on his marble hassock, before his prayer-book of stone. Mr. Sampson {{came out of his}} vestry in his cassock, and nodded to the gentlemen still lingering in the great pew.|$|R
60|$|Then the old man, as if {{overcome}} by the remembrance of his suffering, gave way to tearless grief, when he trembled like one in an ague fit, covering {{his face with his}} wrinkled hands, and rocking his body to and fro until <b>I</b> perforce <b>knelt</b> by the chair to soothe him.|$|R
60|$|Infatuated thing; I stooped low as <b>I</b> <b>knelt,</b> {{and stroked}} softly {{with my own}} the outstretched fingers on which she was leaning.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> down {{to examine}} it, eager {{to clear my}} mind, if I could, of the {{degrading}} jealousy that had got possession of me.|$|E
60|$|Another hour <b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> there, still beseeching Heaven to take mercy upon me. But Heaven {{remained}} unresponsive and {{the wounds}} of the image continued dry.|$|E
60|$|Ion. Nay, I will kneel to thee. <b>I</b> {{who never}} <b>knelt</b> to man before, now implore thee with earnest supplication. 'Tis for a father's life.|$|R
60|$|When having, as I have said, come to {{the rear}} of Master Lord's house and <b>I</b> had <b>knelt</b> down to raise the turf, which was much like unto a lid, Seth Jepson's small remnant of courage fled, and I could feel the scoundrel sink beneath my hand as if his life had {{suddenly}} taken flight.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> went, and <b>knelt,</b> {{and scooped}} my hand As if to drink, into the brook, And a faint figure seemed to stand Above me, with the bygone look.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> {{down and}} kissed the writing. It comforted me--it was like a {{farewell}} touch from Mary's hand. I followed my mother quietly to the carriage.|$|E
60|$|Two men dashed by. I seized one by {{the fringe}} of his shirt, and he flung me from my feet. The other leaped me as <b>I</b> <b>knelt.</b>|$|E
60|$|At length I {{came to a}} Christ-cross stone Which she {{had passed}} without discern; And <b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> upon the leaves there strown, And prayed aloud that she might turn.|$|E
60|$|Besides Fifine Beck's mother, another {{power had}} {{a word to}} say to M. Paul and me, before that {{covenant}} of friendship could be ratified. We were under the surveillance of a sleepless eye: Rome watched jealously her son through that mystic lattice at which <b>I</b> had <b>knelt</b> once, and to which M. Emanuel drew nigh month by month--the sliding panel of the confessional.|$|R
60|$|Ion [proudly]. Nay, <b>I</b> have <b>knelt</b> for {{the last}} time unto Mohammed. I have offered him my liberty, my service, ay, my life itself, and he hath scorned me. I have deigned to bow before him as a suppliant, and he hath spurned me; I have sought by all the power love and despair could teach to move him, and his ear was closed to me. I seek him not again.|$|R
6000|$|Still kneeling, she obeyed him. He slowly raised {{himself on}} the chair. [...] "Take her hand," [...] he said to me. <b>I</b> too <b>knelt.</b> Her hand lay cold in mine. After a long {{interval}} he spoke to me. [...] "Bernard Winterfield," [...] he said, [...] "love them, and help them, when I am gone." [...] He laid his weak hand on our hands, clasped together. [...] "May God protect you! may God bless you!" [...] he murmured. [...] "Kiss me, Stella." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> and prayed: [...] "O Father, smile [...] On him, {{and mercy}} show him!" [...] That countryman looked on the while, [...] And said: [...] "Ye didn't know him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! your Majesty, I can ask no better,' I said fervently; and <b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> to {{kiss the}} {{beautiful}} hand which Anne of Austria extended to me in token of pardon.|$|E
60|$|Feels {{not such}} awful wonder as I felt When first my smitten eyes beat full on thee, And {{all night long}} before thy feet <b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> Till thou wert wearied of Idolatry.|$|E
60|$|She had, however, quickly retreated as he approached, ensconcing herself {{behind the}} high {{back of a}} large antique chair, on the cushion of which she <b>knelt.</b> <b>I</b> regret to add also that she slapped his outstretched fingers a little sharply with her {{inevitable}} black fan as he still advanced.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> then <b>knelt</b> {{down beside}} the fearsome-looking thing, and raising it to its feet motioned for it to follow me. The looks of {{surprise}} which my actions elicited from the Martians were ludicrous; they could not understand, except in a feeble and childish way, such attributes as gratitude and compassion. The warrior whose gun I had struck up looked enquiringly at Tars Tarkas, but the latter signed that I be left to my own devices, and so {{we returned to the}} plaza with my great beast following close at heel, and Sola grasping me tightly by the arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was late}} in the {{afternoon}} of the day before your arrival that he called me to his bedside. Only a few hours ago we had told him that he must die, and since then he had been very silent. <b>I</b> came and <b>knelt</b> before him, and was commencing a prayer, when he stopped me.|$|R
60|$|I {{tried the}} keyhole with my finger. The key {{was not in}} the lock. <b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> down, and looked through the keyhole. The next instant, I was up again on my feet, wild and giddy with horror.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> within half a yard of her. She {{stirred the}} fire, {{so that a}} ripple of light broke from the {{disturbed}} coal: the glare, however, as she sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.|$|E
6000|$|BLOOM: (With desire, with reluctance) I {{can make}} a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellett's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. <b>I</b> <b>knelt</b> once before today. Ah! ...|$|E
60|$|FERROVIUS (with {{the calm}} of a steam hammer) I {{have not always}} been faithful. The first man who struck me as you have just struck me was a {{stronger}} man than you: he hit me harder than I expected. I was tempted and fell; and it was then that I first tasted bitter shame. I never had a happy moment after that until <b>I</b> had <b>knelt</b> and asked his forgiveness by his bedside in the hospital. (Putting his hands on Lentulus's shoulders with paternal weight). But now I have learnt to resist with a strength that is not my own. I am not ashamed now, nor angry.|$|R
60|$|From {{my heart}} there rose a great surge of thankfulness. I fell upon {{my knees and}} prayed. For an hour at least <b>I</b> must have <b>knelt</b> there, seeking grace and strength; and comforted at last, my calm restored, I rose, {{and went to the}} window. I drew back the curtains, and leaned out to breathe the {{physical}} calm of that tepid September night.|$|R
6000|$|I slept; but, hark! that war-shout dread, Which {{rolling through}} the city spread; And this the cry,--"When, Sons of Greece, When shall the {{lingering}} leaguer cease; When will ye spoil Troy's watch-tower high, And home return?"--I heard the cry, And, starting from the genial bed, Veiled, as a Doric maid, <b>I</b> fled, And <b>knelt,</b> Diana, at thy holy fane, A trembling suppliant--all in vain.] ...|$|R
