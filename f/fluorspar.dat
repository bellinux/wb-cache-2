5|$|A {{small amount}} of {{quarrying}} activity {{takes place in the}} city, with 46 active mines and quarries in Gyeongju. Most are engaged in the extraction of kaolin, <b>fluorspar</b> and Agalmatolite and Kaolin is exported.|$|E
5|$|In 1529, Georgius Agricola {{described}} fluorite as an additive used {{to lower}} the melting point of metals during smelting. He penned the Latin word fluorés (fluor, flow) for fluorite rocks. The name later evolved into <b>fluorspar</b> (still commonly used) and then fluorite. The composition of fluorite was later determined to be calcium difluoride.|$|E
5|$|Fluorite or <b>fluorspar</b> {{is called}} Blue John in the Peak District, the name {{allegedly}} {{coming from the}} French Bleu et Jaune which describes the colour of the bandings. Blue John is now scarce, {{and only a few}} hundred kilograms are mined each year for ornamental and lapidary use. The Blue John Cavern in Castleton is a show cave; mining still takes place in the nearby Treak Cliff Cavern.|$|E
5|$|Rich {{deposits}} of iron ore {{are found in}} Cumbria and the North East, and <b>fluorspar</b> and baryte are also plentiful in northern parts of the Pennines. Salt mining in Cheshire has a long history, and both remaining rock salt mines in Great Britain are in the North: Winsford Mine in Cheshire and Boulby Mine in North Yorkshire, which also produces half of the UK's potash.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} two books of the work (Books XXXVI and XXXVII), Pliny {{describes}} many different minerals and gemstones, building on works by Theophrastus and other authors. The topic concentrates on the most valuable gemstones, and he criticises the obsession with luxury products such as engraved gems and hardstone carvings. He provides a thorough discussion of the properties of <b>fluorspar,</b> noting that it is carved into vases and other decorative objects. The account of magnetism includes the myth of Magnes the shepherd.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluorspar</b> or {{fluorite}} is {{an important}} industrial mineral used {{in the manufacture of}} steel, aluminum, glass, and fluorocarbons. It occurs at several localities in the Trans-Pecos and Llano regions of Texas.|$|E
25|$|The {{major areas}} of {{production}} in 2004 were coal (nearly 2billiontons), iron ore (310milliontons), crude petroleum (175milliontons), natural gas (41million cubic meters), antimony ore (110,000tons), tin concentrates (110,000 tons), nickel ore (64,000tons), tungsten concentrates (67,000tons), unrefined salt (37milliontons), vanadium (40,000tons), and molybdenum ore (29,000tons). In order of magnitude, produced minerals were bauxite, gypsum, barite, magnesite, talc and related minerals, manganese ore, <b>fluorspar,</b> and zinc. In addition, China produced 2,450tons {{of silver and}} 215tons of gold in 2004. The mining sector accounted for less than 0.9% of total employment in 2002 but produced about 5.3% of total industrial production.|$|E
25|$|In 1852, in {{his famous}} paper on the change of {{wavelength}} of light, he described the phenomenon of fluorescence, as exhibited by <b>fluorspar</b> and uranium glass, materials which he viewed as having the power to convert invisible ultra-violet radiation into radiation of longer wavelengths that are visible. The Stokes shift, which describes this conversion, is named in Stokes' honour. A mechanical model, illustrating the dynamical principle of Stokes's explanation was shown. The offshoot of this, Stokes line, {{is the basis of}} Raman scattering. In 1883, during a lecture at the Royal Institution, Lord Kelvin said he had heard an account of it from Stokes many years before, and had repeatedly but vainly begged him to publish it.|$|E
25|$|China also {{produces}} a fairly {{wide range of}} nonmetallic minerals. One {{of the most important}} of these is salt, which is derived from coastal evaporation sites in Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong, and Liaoning, as well as from extensive salt fields in Sichuan, Ningxia, and the Qaidam Basin. There are important deposits of phosphate rock in a number of areas; Jiangxi, Guangxi, Yunnan and Hubei. Production has been accelerating every year. As of 2013 China is producing 97,000,000 metric tons of phosphate rock a year. Pyrites occur in several places; Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi have the most important deposits. China also has large resources of fluorite (<b>fluorspar),</b> gypsum, asbestos, and has the world's largest reserves and production of cement, clinker and limestone.|$|E
500|$|During Beatty's first year, wagons {{pulled by}} teams of horses or mules hauled freight between the Bullfrog {{district}} (that included {{the towns of}} Rhyolite, Bullfrog, Gold Center, Transvaal, and Springdale) and the nearest railroad, in Las Vegas, and {{by the middle of}} 1905, about 1,500 horses were engaged in this business. In October 1906, the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad (LV) began regular service to Beatty; in April 1907, the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad (BG) reached the community, and the Tonopah and Tidewater (T) line added a third railroad in October 1907. The LV ceased operations in 1918, the BG in 1928, and the T in 1940. Until the railroads abandoned their lines, Beatty served as the railhead for many mines in the area, including a <b>fluorspar</b> mine on Bare Mountain, to the east.|$|E
500|$|Hydrofluoric acid {{was used}} in glass etching from 1720 onwards. Andreas Sigismund Marggraf first {{characterized}} it in 1764 when he heated fluorite with sulfuric acid, and the resulting solution corroded its glass container. Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele repeated the experiment in 1771, and named the acidic product fluss-spats-syran (<b>fluorspar</b> acid). In 1810, the French physicist André-Marie Ampère suggested that hydrogen and an element analogous to chlorine constituted hydrofluoric acid. Sir Humphry Davy proposed that this then-unknown substance be named fluorine from fluoric acid and the -ine suffix of other halogens. This word, with modifications, is used in most European languages; Greek, Russian, and some others (following Ampère's suggestion) use the name ftor or derivatives, from the Greek φθόριος (phthorios, destructive) [...] The New Latin name fluorum gave the element its current symbol F; Fl {{was used in}} early papers.|$|E
500|$|Fluorine is {{the thirteenth}} most common element in Earth's crust at 600–700ppm (parts per million) by mass. Elemental {{fluorine}} in Earth's atmosphere would easily react with atmospheric water vapor, precluding its natural occurrence; {{it is found}} only in combined mineral forms, of which fluorite, fluorapatite and cryolite are the most industrially significant. Fluorite or <b>fluorspar</b> (...) , colorful and abundant worldwide, is fluorine's main source; China and Mexico are the major suppliers. The U.S. led extraction in the early 20th century but ceased mining in 1995. Although fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F) contains most of the world's fluorine, its low mass fraction of 3.5% means that {{most of it is}} used as a phosphate. In the U.S. small quantities of fluorine compounds are obtained via fluorosilicic acid, a phosphate industry byproduct. Cryolite (...) , once used directly in aluminium production, is the rarest and most concentrated of these three minerals. The main commercial mine on Greenland's west coast closed in 1987, and most cryolite is now synthesized.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Fluorspar</b> {{is another}} mineral {{sporadically}} co-present with Weardale Granite and became {{important in the}} manufacture of steel from the late 19th century into the 20th century. In many cases the steel industries were able to take <b>fluorspar</b> from old excavation heaps. [...] <b>Fluorspar</b> explains why iron and steel manufacture flourished in the Wear valley, Consett and Teesside during the nineteenth century. [...] Overlying are three Carboniferous minerals: limestone, Coal Measures as raw materials for iron and steel manufacture, and sandstone, useful as a refractory material. The last remaining flourspar mine closed in 1999 following legislation re water quality. A mine at Rogerley Quarry, Frosterley, is operated by an American consortium who occasionally work it for specimen minerals.|$|E

Cargos include a wide range of products such as aggregates, salt, grain, <b>fluorspar,</b> lumber, steel, petroleum, vehicles and heavy lift equipment.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "fluorine" [...] {{derives from}} the Latin stem of the main source mineral, fluorite, which was first {{mentioned}} in 1529 by Georgius Agricola, the [...] "father of mineralogy". He described fluorite as a flux—an additive that helps melt ores and slags during smelting. Fluorite stones were called schone flusse in the German of the time. Agricola, writing in Latin but describing 16th century industry, invented several hundred new Latin terms. For the schone flusse stones, he used the Latin noun fluores, [...] "fluxes", because they made metal ores flow when in a fire. After Agricola, the name for the mineral evolved to <b>fluorspar</b> (still commonly used) and then to fluorite.|$|E
2500|$|Mining of lead ore {{has been}} known {{in the area of}} the {{headwaters}} of the Wear since the Roman occupation and continued into the nineteenth century. Spoil heaps from the abandoned lead mines can still be seen, and since the last quarter of the twentieth century have been the focus of attention for the recovery of gangue minerals in present mining, such as <b>fluorspar</b> for the smelting of aluminium. [...] However, abandoned mines and their spoil heaps continue to contribute to heavy metal mineral pollution of the river and its tributaries. This has significance to fishing in times of low flow and infrastructure costs as the River Wear is an important source of drinking water for many of the inhabitants along its course.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1852 {{paper on}} the [...] "Refrangibility" [...] (wavelength change) of light, George Gabriel Stokes {{described}} the ability of <b>fluorspar</b> and uranium glass to change invisible light beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum into blue light. He named this phenomenon fluorescence : [...] "I am almost inclined to coin a word, and call the appearance fluorescence, from fluor-spar , as the analogous term opalescence {{is derived from the}} name of a mineral." [...] The name was derived from the mineral fluorite (calcium difluoride), some examples of which contain traces of divalent europium, which serves as the fluorescent activator to emit blue light. In a key experiment he used a prism to isolate ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and observed blue light emitted by an ethanol solution of quinine exposed by it.|$|E
