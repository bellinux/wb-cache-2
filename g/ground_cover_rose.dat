Relationships between spatial heterogeneity of tiller density, light interception, <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> and seasonal DM yield were developed. Sward heterogeneity was quantified by the spatial standard deviation of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> and of logarithmically transformed <b>ground</b> <b>cover,</b> and patterns in <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> transects were quantified by wavelet entropy. An experiment was conducted with eight control (C) swards, eight naturally damaged (ND) swards and twelve artificially damaged (AD) swards. Swards were established in containers and spectroscopic images were recorded twice weekly. Seasonal DM yield was linearly related to a combination of means of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> and index of reflection intensity (r 2 = 0. 93). Spatial variation of tiller density was larger for AD and ND swards than for C swards. Values of the spatial standard deviation of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> and wavelet entropy were larger for AD and ND swards than for C swards. A single spatial standard deviation of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> value of 13 % discriminated ND and AD swards from C swards.

40|$|Suitable {{measures}} of grazing impacts on <b>ground</b> <b>cover,</b> that enable {{separation of the}} effects of climatic variations, are needed to inform land managers and policy makers across the arid rangelands of Australia. This work developed and tested a time-series, changepoint detection method for application to time series of vegetation fractional cover derived from Landsat data to identify irregular and episodic ground-cover growth cycles. Utilising the High Performance Computing power of the Google Cloud Compute Engine these cycles were segmented to distinguish grazing impacts from that of climate variability. A measure of grazing impact was developed using a multivariate technique to quantify the rate and degree of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> change. The method was successful in detecting both long term and short term growth cycles. Growth cycle detection was assessed against rainfall surplus measures indicating a relationship with high rainfall periods. During periods of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> decline, grazing utilisation was observed across four major grasslands. <b>Ground</b> <b>cover</b> change associated with grazing impacts was also assessed against field measurements of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> indicating a relationship between both field and remotely sensed <b>ground</b> <b>cover.</b> Cause and effects between grazing practices and <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> resilience can now be explored in isolation to climatic drivers.

40|$|Understory {{vegetation}} and <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> drive many important ecosystem processes, including tree seedling regeneration. The exact effect of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> on tree seedling establishment, survival, and growth depends on biophysical context. In subalpine forests, this context is largely determined by disturbances such as beetle outbreak, blowdown, and fire. Compounded disturbances that overlap in short succession can alter stand properties and trajectories {{in ways that}} are not predictable from the additive impact of individual disturbances. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine how compounded Dendroctonus rufipennis (spruce beetle; SB) outbreak followed by fire and compounded wind blowdown followed by fire each influence the relationship between post-fire <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> and conifer regeneration. We measured categorical <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> percentages and conifer regeneration densities in permanent plots from 2003 - 2014 after stand-replacing fires of 2002 burned stands that had been blown down in 1997, affected by SB outbreak in the 1940 s, or neither. We used mixed-effect models to measure the relationships between stand attributes and post-fire <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> as well as between post-fire <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> and conifer regeneration densities. <b>Ground</b> <b>cover</b> patterns were sensitive to compounded disturbances, and the relationships between conifer regeneration and <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> were fundamentally different when fire was preceded by another disturbance. Conifer regeneration densities increased with increased litter coverage in stands that only burned, but decreased with increased litter coverage in stands that were blown down and then burned. Similarly, herbaceous cover changed from facilitative to competitive when fire was preceded by SB outbreak.

40|$|Wild pollinators are {{becoming}} more valuable to global agriculture as the commercial honeybee industry is increasingly affected by disease and other stressors. Perennial tree crops are particularly reliant on insect pollination, and are often pollen limited. Research on how different tree crop production systems influence the richness and abundance of wild pollinators is, however, limited. We investigated, for the first time, the richness and abundance of potential wild pollinators in commercial temperate almond orchards in Australia, and compared them to potential pollinator communities in proximate native vegetation. We quantified <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> variables at each site and assessed the value of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> on the richness and abundance of potential wild pollinators in commercial almond systems focussing on three common taxa: bees, wasps and flies. More insects were caught in orchards with living <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> than in native vegetation or orchards without <b>ground</b> <b>cover,</b> although overall species richness was highest in native vegetation. Percent <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> was positively associated with wasp richness and abundance, and native bee richness, but flies showed no association with <b>ground</b> <b>cover.</b> The strongest positive relationship was between native bee abundance and the richness of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> plants.

40|$|Aspects of the {{establishment}} and use of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> plants for urban weed control were investigated. Established <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> populations of different taxa were monitored over 1 year at 14 sites {{for their ability to}} block light from the soil and prevent weeds from establishing. Field trials compared 12 <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> species of widely differing growth form for rate of establishment and ability to block light and suppress weeds. Another field trial compared various types of mulch with selective herbicides and hand weeding as techniques for establishing <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> species. No single growth form was superior to others, and it was the density of the foliage that was key to suppressing weeds. <b>Ground</b> <b>cover</b> plants should be selected for having persistently dense canopies throughout the year, such as Coprosma acerosa ‘Taiko’ and Juniperus procumbens. Deciduous species like Persicaria capitata, evergreen species which become sparser in winter like Pimelea prostrata, and plant canopies which open up during flowering like Grevillea lanigera, all allow weeds to germinate while the ground is exposed. <b>Ground</b> <b>cover</b> plants appear to deter weeds mainly by keeping weed seeds dormant through preventing red light from reaching weed seeds and triggering a phytochrome response leading to germination. Keeping the ratio of red to far-red light below 0. 3 appeared to give best inhibition of weed seed germination. Presence of mulch and spot application of selective herbicides can help prevent weeds causing problems should gaps appear within <b>ground</b> <b>covers,</b> and these may be preferable to hand weeding. Little herbicide tolerance information exists for ornamental <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> plants, so herbicide tolerance trials were conducted on eight <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> plant species.

There has been evidence that a <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> that provides a suitable environment for colonization of AMF and subsequent symbiosis could be a tool in organic fruit production. The objective of this research was to compare colonization of AMF in strawberry plant (Frageria x ananassa cv. Radiance) and apple rootstocks (Malus x domestica, cv. M. 26) grown in a greenhouse affected by various <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> treatments. Inoculation was achieved by mixing BioOrganics™ Endomycorrhizal Inoculant directly into soilless media according to label rates. Following a dormancy period, plants were treated with one of the following <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> treatments: 1) city-generated urban green-compost (GC), 2) shredded white paper, 3) urban refuse wood chips or 4) an untreated control. The GC <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> significantly increased percent colonization of AMF compared to other ground covers; however, AMF infection did not affect plant biomass, root volume, root surface area, root diameter, or leaf area. The AMF suppressed root length; plants inoculated with AMF had shorter roots but similar root volume to compared to non-inoculated plants. The GC treatment may have disproportionately contributed more nutrition by media composition of a smaller particle size and a decreased lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose content compared to other <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> treatments.

The method is based on persistence of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> in years of lower rainfall and objectively separates grazing effects on <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> from those due to inter-annual variation in rainfall. The method is applied only to areas where trees and shrubs were not cleared. An indicator of rangeland state was derived, at Landsat-TM pixel resolution, by subtracting automatically-calculated reference <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> from actual <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> and then spatially averaging these deviations across the area of each sub-bioregion. Landscape heterogeneity may affect reference cover but, because it is stable over time, change in mean cover deficit between sequences of dry years reliably indicates change due to grazing. All 34 sub-regions analysed had similar or increased levels of seasonally-adjusted <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> {{at the end of the}} analysis period, which was either 2003 or 2005. Allowing for possible landscape heterogeneity effects on assessed condition, the Einasleigh Uplands bioregion was comparatively in a better state and those analysed parts of the Mulga Lands bioregion in poorer state at the first assessment in 1988. Most sub-regions of the Cape York Peninsula, Brigalow Belt North, Desert Uplands, Gulf Plains and Mitchell Grass Downs bioregions lay between these two end-states. Simulated levels of pasture utilisation based on modelled pasture growth and statistically-based grazing pressure supported the results of this regional assessment of land condition. The dynamic reference-cover method will allow the Queensland Government to monitor future grazing effects on rangeland <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> between sequences of drier years - quantitatively and efficiently across the entire state.

40|$|Remote {{detection}} of management-related {{trend in the}} presence of inter-annual climatic variability in the rangelands is difficult. Minimally disturbed reference areas provide a useful guide, but suitable benchmarks are usually difficult to identify. We describe a method that uses a unique conceptual framework to identify reference areas from multitemporal sequences of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> derived from Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery. The method does not require ground-based reference sites nor GIS layers about management. We calculate a minimum <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> image across all years to identify locations of most persistent <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> in years of lowest rainfall. We then use a moving window approach to calculate the difference between the window 2 ̆ 7 s central pixel and its surrounding reference pixels. This difference estimates ground-cover change between successive below-average rainfall years, which provides a seasonally interpreted measure of management effects. We examine the approach 2 ̆ 7 s sensitivity to window size and to cover-index percentiles used to define persistence. The method successfully detected management-related change in <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> in Queensland tropical savanna woodlands in two case studies: (1) a grazing trial where heavy stocking resulted in substantial decline in <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> in small paddocks, and (2) commercial paddocks where wet-season spelling (destocking) resulted in increased <b>ground</b> <b>cover.</b> At a larger scale, there was broad agreement between our analysis of ground-cover change and ground-based land condition change for commercial beef properties with different a priori ratings of initial condition, but there was also some disagreement where changing condition reflected pasture composition rather than <b>ground</b> <b>cover.</b> We conclude that the method is suitably robust to analyse grazing effects on <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> across the 1. 3 x 10 (6) km(2) of Queensland 2 ̆ 7 s rangelands.
