Given that the transfer of the gold had commenced hours before the beginning of the session, the Council was unable to prevent such a decision. Nevertheless, the only two stockholder representatives of the Bank of Spain that had not allied themselves with the Nationalists (José Álvarez Guerra y Lorenzo Martínez Fresneda), submitted their resignation. Martínez Fresneda protested, arguing that the transfer was illegal, since the gold was of the exclusive property of the Bank of Spain, and thus neither the State nor the Government could take hold of it; he also pointed out that the <b>gold</b> <b>guaranteed</b> by law the convertibility of Bank notes, and should therefore remain in the security vaults of the Bank: ...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{presents}} {{a case study}} of how constitutional actors respond when {{the rule of law and}} necessity are sharply at odds and provides some background on Section Four of the Fourteenth Amendment. In 1935, the Supreme Court heard constitutional challenges to the abrogation of “gold clauses” in contracts and Treasury bonds. <b>Gold</b> clauses <b>guaranteed</b> that creditors would receive payment in gold dollars as valued at the time a contract was made. Due to the deflation that followed the Great Depression, this meant that debtors were being forced to pay back much more than they owed originally. To stop a looming wave of bankruptcies, Congress passed a Joint Resolution declaring all gold clauses null and void. Following oral argument, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was concerned that the Court would invalidate the Joint Resolution. He concluded that he could not accept this result, and thus drafted a Fireside Chat announcing that he would not comply with such a decision. This unprecedented statement, which invoked the New Testament and necessity as the grounds for rejecting the Court‘s decision, has never been closely analyzed until now. In the end, the Court did not hold that the gold clauses must be enforced. With respect to Treasury Bonds, however, a plurality of the Justices concluded that the Joint Resolution was unconstitutional but that the bondholders were not entitled to relief. This slippery reasoning (in Perry v. United States) harkened back to Chief Justice Marshall‘s approach in Marbury v. Madison—another case in which the Court was confronted with presidential defiance. By recounting how President Roosevelt and Chief Justice Hughes—the author of Perry—sought to defuse (or, in some cases, exacerbate) the gold crisis, the dark arts of constitutional interpretation are exposed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Surgical {{training}} in virtual, animal and cadaver models {{is essential for}} minimally invasive surgery. Thiel cadavers are suitable for laparoscopy, but there are few data {{about the use of}} embalmed (Tutsch method) and slightly embalmed (Thiel method) cadavers in procedures of Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES), which are usually developed and learned on swine models and fresh frozen cadavers. The aim of this study was thus to assess the use of these cadavers for NOTES approaches. METHODS: The following surgical procedures were evaluated: transanal total mesorectal excision (four cadavers: one Tutsch, two Thiel, one fresh frozen), transanal ileorectal bypass (five cadavers: one Tutsch, three Thiel, one fresh frozen), and transvaginal appendectomy (two Tutsch cadaver). RESULTS: The Thiel method ensured tissue flexibility and consistency suitable for performing the above surgical procedures with good results and without complications, with only a small increase in rigidity with respect to fresh specimens. Cadavers embalmed with higher formalin concentrations (Tutsch method) were more difficult to use, due to high tissue rigidity and resistance of the abdominal wall to pneumoperitoneum, although NOTES accesses were possible. CONCLUSIONS: Thiel cadavers are suitable for transanal/transrectal and transvaginal NOTES approaches, for training surgical residents/specialists and also for surgical research. In minimally invasive surgery (and particularly in NOTES), integration between cadaver (fresh frozen and/or Thiel) and animal models would represent the <b>gold</b> standard, allowing <b>guaranteed</b> knowledge of and respect for human surgical anatomy and correct management of surgery on living subjects. NOTES approaches to human cadavers may also be proposed for the anatomical education of medical students...|$|R

However, after the creation of the Bretton Woods system, an International Monetary Fund was created within the framework, as well as a <b>gold</b> pool that <b>guaranteed</b> that the dollar was as gold as gold, capital began to leave the country and move to Europe. Military expenditures accounted for a huge share of the US budget deficit, which tried in vain ways to prevent further growth in the deficit: on the one hand, in every way limiting the flow of gold, on the other hand, not allowing foreign central banks to receive gold for the given dollars. Very soon such a policy appealed to European bankers who found such a policy hypocritical, but could not do anything because they were afraid to bring down the dollar and thereby deprive their producers of competitiveness in American markets.|$|R
