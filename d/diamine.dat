5|$|Radioactive samarium-153 is a {{beta emitter}} with a {{half-life}} of 46.3 hours. It {{is used to}} kill cancer cells {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and osteosarcoma. For this purpose, samarium-153 is chelated with ethylene <b>diamine</b> tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) and injected intravenously. The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells. The corresponding drug has several names including samarium (153Sm) lexidronam; its trade name is Quadramet.|$|E

On the other hand, <b>diamines</b> with two, four and six methylene groups are not effective in the compaction of DNA.

Alcohol both stimulates the release of histamine from mast cells and inhibits its degradations by inhibiting <b>diamine</b> oxidase.

A pH metric method was used for calculation of protonation constants. The effects of solvents on protonation constant have been determined at ionic strength 0. 2 M dm- 3 (NaClO 4) and temperature 30 ± 0. 1 oC under nitrogen atmosphere. FORTRAN (IV) programs were used for calculation of protonation constants and distribution of species like H 2 L, HL, L in equilibrium state. The logarithm of the protonation constants decrease in aliphatic <b>diamines</b> and increase in aromatic <b>diamines</b> with increase in methanol content in mixed equilibria. The verification of constants are explained {{on the basis of}} solute-solvent interaction, solvation, proton transfer processes and dielectric constant of equilibria.

40|$|The aminolysis of aryl diphenylphosphinates, p-nitrophenyl diphenylphosphinothionate, -phosphinothioate, and -phosphinodithioate by n-butylamine, by the {{secondary}} amines piperidine, pyrrolidine, morpholine, and dipropylamine, {{as well as}} by a series of <b>diamines,</b> has been studied in acetonitrile.

The second order in amine term predominates. sec-Amines and <b>diamines</b> follow a rate law which is first order in amine only. Leaving group effects, solvent effects, and activation parameters support a pathway which involves rate-determining collapse of a zwitterionic pentacoordinate intermediate.

25|$|The {{starting}} {{materials in the}} Piloty–Robinson pyrrole synthesis, named for Gertrude and Robert Robinson and Oskar Piloty, are two equivalents of an aldehyde and hydrazine. The product is a pyrrole with substituents at the 3 and 4 positions. The aldehyde reacts with the <b>diamine</b> to an intermediate di-imine (R–C=N−N=C–R). In the second step, a -sigmatropic rearrangement takes place between. Addition of hydrochloric acid leads to ring closure and loss of ammonia to form the pyrrole.

25|$|In 1952, {{learning}} of the stimulating side effects of isoniazid, the Cincinnati psychiatrist Max Lurie tried it on his patients. In the following year, he and Harry Salzer reported that isoniazid improved depression in two thirds of their patients and coined the term antidepressant to describe its action. A similar incident took place in Paris, where Jean Delay, head of psychiatry at Sainte-Anne Hospital, heard of this effect from his pulmonology colleagues at Cochin Hospital. In 1952 (before Lurie and Salzer), Delay, with the resident Jean-Francois Buisson, reported {{the positive effect of}} isoniazid on depressed patients. The mode of antidepressant action of isoniazid is still unclear. It is speculated that its effect is due to the inhibition of <b>diamine</b> oxidase, coupled with a weak inhibition of monoamine oxidase A.|$|E
25|$|Calcium, {{as found}} in food such as milk and green vegetables, is often {{recommended}} to protect against dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent decay of a tooth by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. Streptococcus mutans {{is the leading cause}} of tooth decay. Low concentration fluoride ions act as bacteriostatic therapeutic agent and high concentration fluoride ions are bactericidal. The incorporated fluorine makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and, thus, resistant to decay. Topical fluoride is more highly recommended than systemic intake such as by tablets or drops to protect the surface of the teeth. This may include a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash or varnish. Standard fluoride toothpaste (1,000–1,500 ppm) is more effective than low fluoride toothpaste (< 600ppm) to prevent dental caries. After brushing with fluoride toothpaste, rinsing should be avoided and the excess spat out. Many dental professionals include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine visits and recommend the use of xylitol and amorphous calcium phosphate products. Silver <b>diamine</b> fluoride may work better than fluoride varnish to prevent cavities. Water fluoridation also lowers the risk of tooth decay.|$|E

2500|$|Hydrogenation is {{a useful}} means for {{converting}} unsaturated compounds into saturated derivatives. [...] Substrates include not only alkenes and alkynes, but also aldehydes, imines, and nitriles, which are converted into the corresponding saturated compounds, i.e. alcohols and amines.

E.g. 1-propanol is produced from propionaldehyde, produced from ethene and carbon monoxide. Xylitol, a polyol, is produced by hydrogenation of the sugar xylose, an aldehyde. Primary amines can be synthesized by hydrogenation of nitriles, while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and a suitable electrophile.
