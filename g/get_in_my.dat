500|$|Clarke, the film's director, {{writer and}} producer, also {{starred in the}} lead role of Dr. Gilbert McKenna. A veteran actor, he wanted his {{character}} to seem realistic and multi-dimensional, with both bad and good qualities. [...] "I acted the part as if I wouldn't let anything <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> way", Clarke later recalled. The rest of the cast consisted mostly of aspiring actors and actresses from around USC, with some characters played by Clarke's friends and family. Actress Nan Peterson, in her acting debut, was cast {{in the role of}} Trudy Osborne because of her voluptuous figure, according to Clarke. Originally, singer Marilyn King of The King Sisters, who was Clarke's sister-in-law, was cast for the role, but she dropped out due to her pregnancy at the time of production. King, however, did write and perform the song [...] "Strange Pursuit", featured in the bar scene in the film, providing the vocals for Peterson's character. Peterson had previously worked as a model for Catalina Bathing Suits and was touring nationwide as [...] "Miss Vornado" [...] for the Vornado air conditioning company. Xandra Conkling, who played the little girl who befriends McKenna in the film, was actually the daughter of Clarke's wife's sister. Pearl Driggs, who portrayed an old woman on the hospital roof, was Clarke's mother-in-law. A radio announcer heard in the film was played by Clarke's sister-in-law's fiance, and Clarke's nephew played a newsboy in the film.|$|E

2500|$|Kraftwerk's musical {{style and}} image {{can be heard}} and seen in 1980s synthpop groups such as Gary Numan, Ultravox, John Foxx, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Human League, Depeche Mode, Visage, and Soft Cell. Kraftwerk would also go on to {{influence}} other forms of music such as hip hop, house, and drum and bass, and they are also regarded as pioneers of the electro genre. Most notably, [...] "Trans Europe Express" [...] and [...] "Numbers" [...] were interpolated into [...] "Planet Rock" [...] by Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force, {{one of the earliest}} hip-hop/electro hits. Kraftwerk helped ignite the New York electro-movement. Techno was created by three musicians from Detroit, {{often referred to as the}} 'Belleville three' (Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson & Derrick May), who fused the repetitive melodies of Kraftwerk with funk rhythms. The Belleville three were heavily influenced by Kraftwerk and their sounds because Kraftwerk's sounds appealed to the middle-class blacks residing in Detroit at this time. Depeche Mode's composer Martin Gore emphasized: [...] "For anyone of our generation involved in electronic music, Kraftwerk were the godfathers". Vince Clarke of Erasure, Yazoo and Depeche Mode, is also a notable disco and Kraftwerk fan. Daniel Miller, founder of Mute Records, purchased the vocoder used by Kraftwerk in their early albums, comparing it to owning [...] "the guitar Jimi Hendrix used on 'Purple Haze'." [...] Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys, founding members of OMD, have stated that Kraftwerk was a major reference on their early work, and covered [...] "Neon Lights" [...] on the 1991 album, Sugar Tax. The electronic band Ladytron were inspired by Kraftwerk's song [...] "The Model" [...] when they composed their debut single [...] "He Took Her To a Movie". Richard D James a.k.a. Aphex Twin, has noted Kraftwerk as one of his biggest influences and called Computer World as a very influential album towards his music and sound. Björk has cited the band as one of her main musical influences. Electronic musician Kompressor has cited Kraftwerk as an influence. The band was also mentioned in the song [...] "Rappers We Crush" [...] by Kompressor and MC Frontalot ("I hurry away, <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> Chrysler. Oh, the dismay!/Someone's replaced all of my Backstreet Boys with Kraftwerk tapes!"). Dr. Alex Paterson of the Orb listed The Man-Machine as one of his 13 most favourite albums of all time. According to NME, Kraftwerk’s pioneering [...] "robot pop" [...] also spawned groups like Prodigy, and Daft Punk.|$|E
