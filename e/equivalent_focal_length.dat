2500|$|In digital photography, the 35mm-equivalent {{aperture}} {{range is}} sometimes {{considered to be}} more important than the actual f-number. [...] Equivalent aperture is the f-number adjusted to correspond to the f-number of the same size absolute aperture diameter on a lens with a 35mm <b>equivalent</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> [...] Smaller equivalent f-numbers are expected to lead to higher image quality based on more total light from the subject, as well as lead to reduced depth of field. [...] For example, a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10 uses a 1" [...] sensor, 24–200mm with maximum aperture constant along the zoom range; [...] 2.8 has equivalent aperture range 7.6, which is a lower equivalent f-number than some other 2.8 cameras with smaller sensors.|$|E

50|$|Quoted 35 mm <b>equivalent</b> <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> {{typically}} ignore {{depth of}} field (DOF), which depends on both <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> and aperture. The perceived DOF of smaller sensors is deeper due to the shorter <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> lenses.|$|R

50|$|Originally {{produced}} as Konica Minolta AF Zoom DT 11-18mm f/4.5-5.6 (D) (2698-110) by Konica Minolta in 2005, and currently produced by Sony, the Sony α DT 11-18mm f/4.5-5.6 {{is compatible with}} cameras using the Minolta A-mount and Sony A-mount lens mounts. The DT designation means this lens {{is designed to be}} used with a camera with an APS-C size sensor.

5000|$|The [...] smaller {{diagonal}} {{size of the}} DX format amounts to a [...] narrower angle of view than would be achieved with the 135 film format (35 mm film or FX format), using a lens of the same <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> Strictly in angle-of-view terms, the effect is <b>equivalent</b> to increasing <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> by 50% on a 135 film camera, and so {{is often described as}} a 1.5x <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> multiplier.|$|R
50|$|The lens is {{designed}} specifically for use with APS-C sized image sensors, and thus will result in vignetting on 35 mm (full frame) cameras.

50|$|The two {{fundamental}} parameters of an optical lens are the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> and the maximum aperture. The lens' <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> determines the magnification {{of the image}} projected onto the image plane, and the aperture the light intensity of that image. For a given photographic system the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> determines the angle of view, short <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> giving a wider field of view than longer <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> lenses. A wider aperture, identified by a smaller f-number, allows using a faster shutter speed for the same exposure.|$|R

50|$|In photography, the 35 mm <b>equivalent</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> is {{a measure}} that {{indicates}} the angle {{of view of a}} particular combination of a camera lens and film or sensor size. The term is useful because most photographers experienced with interchangeable lenses are most familiar with the 35 mm film format.|$|E
50|$|According to CIPA guidelines, 35 mm <b>equivalent</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> {{is to be}} {{calculated}} like this:“Converted focal length into 35mm camera” = (Diagonal distance of image area in the 35mm camera (43.27mm) / Diagonal distance of image area on the image sensor of the DSC) × focal length of {{the lens of the}} DSC.|$|E
50|$|The narrowness of {{the band}} of colors that a {{monochromator}} can generate {{is related to the}} <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of the monochromator collimators. Using a longer <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> optical system also unfortunately decreases the amount of light that can be accepted from the source. Very high resolution monochromators might have a <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of 2 meters. Building such monochromators requires exceptional attention to mechanical and thermal stability. For many applications a monochromator of about 0.4 meter <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> is considered to have excellent resolution.

25|$|A device which {{produces}} converging or diverging light rays due to refraction {{is known as}} a lens. Lenses are characterized by their focal length: a converging lens has positive <b>focal</b> <b>length,</b> while a diverging lens has negative <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> Smaller <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> indicates that the lens has a stronger converging or diverging effect. The <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of a simple lens in air is given by the lensmaker's equation.|$|R
