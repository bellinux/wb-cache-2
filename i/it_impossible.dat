5|$|After {{graduating from}} DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his {{doctorate}} in chemistry, but learned {{it would be}} difficult for an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained a position as a chemistry instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed him to attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that Euro-American students would resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, making <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for him to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.|$|E
5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he shot {{a few of the}} scenes with Eskimo women when coverage was found to be lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight made <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to film. To reduce glare from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E
5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E

Later research indicated Hudson had successfully shot down the first aircraft. The exact timing of Hudson and Moran's victories remains unclear, and it is possible each scored a victory within seconds of the other. For his determination in leading the flight, though, Little was awarded a Silver Star Medal.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{constant}} {{attention to the}} business, the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products proved to be insurmountable, making <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for Coffin to find a replacement to run the company {{so that he could}} return to Indiana. The company remained in business primarily through the financial support of wealthy benefactors. Coffin sold the business in 1857, after deciding {{it would be impossible to}} maintain a profitable business.|$|E
5|$|Despite the damage, Tyler {{was able}} to move back into his castle, which was now {{protected}} by a small Parliamentary garrison. After investigation by Parliamentary agents Brown and Selden, however, the castle was slighted the following year, which rendered <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to defend. The Countess of Kent, the new owner of the castle, was given £1,000 in damages, but chose not to rebuild the fortification as it was by then virtually uninhabitable.|$|E

5|$|During a later court {{session on}} September 9, Takaesu {{attempted}} to submit medical evidence that Brown {{had suffered a}} back injury in 1999 and had a steel collar and bolts inserted around his spine.

The Naha court panel of three judges agreed to issue a decision as to whether the evidence was submissable at a later date.|$|E
5|$|England won {{the final}} match by one wicket, but lost the series 2–1. While {{contemporary}} critics did not blame MacLaren, the cricket authorities were less happy.

He finished the series with 198 runs at 28.28, and ended the season with 1,254 first-class runs at 32.15.|$|E
5|$|Giron and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz {{claimed that}} the recall defeat was due to voter {{suppression}}. The Denver Post disputed this, saying that the result wasn't caused by voter suppression {{but the fact that}} more people showed up to vote against Giron than to vote for her. Gessler said that the Democrats fared worse where more people turned out. Wasserman Schultz also stated that the money spent by the NRA and the Koch brothers made <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for Democrats to win.|$|E

5|$|However, Black {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese internment during World War II. Black also consistently opposed the doctrine of substantive due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept made <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> {{for the government to}} enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of business owners) and believed that there was no basis {{in the words of the}} Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in Griswold v.

5|$|In 1935, the {{political}} climate in Italy (under Mussolini) became unacceptable to Escher. He {{had no interest in}} politics, finding <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to involve himself with any ideals other than the expressions of his own concepts through his own particular medium, but he was averse to fanaticism and hypocrisy. When his eldest son, George, was forced at the age of nine to wear a Ballila uniform in school, the family left Italy and moved to Château-d'Œx, Switzerland, where they remained for two years.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the {{stations}} on the Sognsvann Line were rebuilt. The platforms were lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains and the platform height was increased. The third rail made <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to cross the}} line at-grade; an underpass was therefore constructed at Berg station. The station was also redesigned in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds designed by architect Arne Henriksen.|$|E

5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species have revealed {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time.

5|$|Lastly, Tai Loong had argued, {{even if the}} KD II was {{a fishing}} vessel under the statute, the interplay between two {{sections}} of the SFPA and its implementing regulations rendered them unconstitutionally vague, making <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for it to easily determine whether the statute applied to the KD II. It argued that this failure {{of the government to}} thus provide adequate notice that the law would be enforced against such vessels was a violation of their right to due process.|$|E
