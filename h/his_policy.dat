5|$|The goal of <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> was to {{withdraw}} all the U.S. forces from Europe.

5|$|After the Mongol withdrawal, Béla IV {{abandoned}} <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> {{of recovering}} former crown lands. Instead, he granted large estates to his supporters, and {{urged them to}} construct stone-and-mortar castles. He initiated {{a new wave of}} colonization that resulted in the arrival of a number of Germans, Moravians, Poles, and Romanians. The king re-invited the Cumans and settled them in the plains along the Danube and the Tisza. A group of Alans, the ancestors of the Jassic people, seems to have settled in the kingdom around the same time.|$|E
5|$|An {{energetic}} and ambitious ruler, Michael Shishman led an aggressive but opportunistic and inconsistent foreign policy against the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Serbia, {{which ended in}} the disastrous battle of Velbazhd which claimed his own life. He was the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who aimed at military and political hegemony of the Bulgarian Empire over the Balkans {{and the last one}} who attempted to seize Constantinople. He was succeeded by his son Ivan Stephen and later by his nephew Ivan Alexander, who reversed <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> by forming an alliance with Serbia.|$|E

Rwanda was only the second country, after Mozambique, to join the Commonwealth having never had colonial links to the British Empire. Kagame attended the subsequent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, addressing the Business Forum. Rwanda also successfully applied for a rotating seat on the United Nations Security Council in 2012, taking over the presidency of that organisation in April 2013.|$|E

5|$|During {{a tour of}} the Philippines {{the month}} after the Yesterday and Today furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had {{expected}} them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> to accept such official invitations. They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer. The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty. Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Khánh spread rumors in {{the capital}} that the French were behind a plan to install a pro-communist {{government}} that would implement de Gaulle's plans for the neutralization of Vietnam. Helping Khánh in a concerted smear campaign were Khiêm and Thieu. The French Foreign Office had announced that Paris would establish diplomatic relations with Peking on January 28, and Khánh used {{this as an opportunity}} to play on American anti-neutralist sentiment. De Gaulle's attempt to cultivate relations with communist China was tied to <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> of calling on US troops to leave Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, Michael Palaeologus {{died and}} his son Andronicus II took power. The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the society at large; <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> of Latin {{appeasement}} to the Church in Rome, heavy taxation and military expenditure placed a severe burden on the people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking land from the Empire, they were seen as liberators of Anatolians and many soon converted to Islam undermining the Byzantine's Orthodox power base.|$|E
50|$|Stalinism usually denotes a {{style of}} a government, and an ideology. While Stalin claimed to be an {{adherent}} to the ideas of Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx, and hence purported that <b>his</b> <b>policies</b> were merely {{a style of}} government, some critics say that many of <b>his</b> <b>policies</b> and beliefs diverged from those of Lenin and Marx.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Olga, her eldest son, King Constantine I of Greece, {{was determined to}} follow a policy of neutrality. His maternal relations were Russian, and his wife was the sister of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. <b>His</b> <b>policy</b> brought him into conflict with Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who favored the Allies. Constantine was soon {{accused of being a}} Germanophile and the Athenian government was regarded with suspicion in London and Paris. In {{what became known as the}} National Schism, Venizelos established a parallel government in Thessaloniki in opposition to Constantine.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{compares the}} executions of Domitian to those under Emperor Claudius (41–55), noting that Claudius {{executed}} around 35 senators and 300 equestrians, and yet was still deified by the Senate and {{regarded as one}} of the good Emperors of history. Domitian was apparently unable to gain support among the aristocracy, despite attempts to appease hostile factions with consular appointments. His autocratic style of government accentuated the Senate's loss of power, while <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> of treating patricians and even family members as equals to all Romans earned him their contempt.|$|E
5|$|Parts of Greece were {{occupied}} by the Allied Entente forces, but Constantine I refused to modify <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> and faced increasingly open opposition from the Entente and the Venizelists. In July 1916, an arson attack ravaged Tatoi Palace and the royal family barely escaped the flames; Alexander was not injured but his mother narrowly saved Princess Katherine by carrying her through the woods {{for more than two}} kilometers. Among the palace personnel and firefighters who arrived to deal with the blaze, sixteen people were killed.|$|E

5|$|The reforms {{implemented}} by Djedkare are generally assessed negatively in modern Egyptology as <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> of decentralization created a virtual feudal system that transferred much {{power to the}} high and provincial administrations. Some Egyptologists such as Naguib Kanawati argue that this contributed heavily {{to the collapse of}} the Egyptian state during the First Intermediate Period, c. 200 years later. These conclusions are rejected by Nigel Strudwick, who says that in spite of Djedkare's reforms, Ancient Egyptian officials never amassed enough power to rival that of the king.|$|E
5|$|Truman's second inauguration was {{the first}} ever {{televised}} nationally. His second term was grueling as his opponents controlled Congress and <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> of rollback in Korea failed. The Soviet Union's atomic bomb project progressed much faster than had been expected and they detonated their first bomb on August 29, 1949. In response, on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the detonation of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, which was much {{more powerful than the}} Soviets' atomic weapons.|$|E
5|$|When Bahá'u'lláh {{returned}} to Baghdad {{he saw that}} the Bábí community had become disheartened and divided. During Bahá'u'lláh's absence, it had become alienated from the religion because Mirza Yahya had continued <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> of militancy and had been unable to provide effective leadership. Mirza Yahya had married the widow of the Báb against the Báb's clear instructions; dispatched followers to the province of Nur for the second attempt on the life of the Shah; and instigated violence against prominent Bábís who had challenged his leadership.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Arana, Árbenz contested the presidential {{elections}} that were held in 1950 and without significant opposition defeated Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, his nearest challenger, {{by a margin of}} over 50%. He took office on March 15, 1951, and continued the social reform policies of his predecessor. These reforms included an expanded right to vote, the ability of workers to organize, legitimizing political parties, and allowing public debate. The centerpiece of <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> was an agrarian reform law under which uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Ivan Alexander in 1371 Ivan Sratsimir broke off ties with Tarnovo and even placed the {{archbishop}} of Vidin {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Patriarchate of Constantinople to demonstrate his independence. Due to its geographical position, Vidin was initially safe from attacks by the Ottoman Turks who were ravaging the Balkans to the south and Ivan Sratsimir made no attempts to assist Ivan Shishman in his struggle against the Ottomans. Only after the fall of Tarnovo in 1393 did <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> become more active and he eventually joined the crusade of the Hungarian king Sigismund. However, after the disastrous battle of Nicopolis in 1396, the Ottomans marched to Vidin and seized it. Ivan Sratsimir was captured and imprisoned in Bursa where he was probably strangled. Although his son Constantine II claimed the title Emperor of Bulgaria and at times controlled some parts of his father's realm, Ivan Sratsimir is generally regarded by historians as the last ruler of medieval Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{the absence}} of starchy {{historical}} content in Robert doubtless {{played a part in}} attracting the bourgeoisie to the opera, until then regarded as primarily an aristocratic entertainment. The success of the opera also justified the government's policy of 'privatization' in selling the management to Véron, and this was a landmark in the dilution of state control and patronage in the fine arts. Although Véron had not commissioned it (having taken control only after the Revolution), Robert was his first new production as manager of the Opéra, and its success underwrote <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> of commissioning similar works. These were to include Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots, Fromental Halévy's La Juive, and Daniel Auber's Gustave III. However, while they used 'the same dazzling theatrical rhetoric' as Robert, they led to 'uniformly horrific dénouements' with 'gripping moral urgency', their more sophisticated plot-lines reflecting the changes in taste of the new opera clientele.
