To fund the mission, 100,000 pounds sterling in gold was deposited in an account at the Deutsche Bank in Constantinople. The expedition was also provided with gold and other gifts for the Emir, including jewelled watches, gold <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> ornamental rifles, binoculars, cameras, cinema projectors, and an alarm clock.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, the Bíró {{brothers}} and a friend, Juan Jorge Meyne, fled Germany {{and moved to}} Argentina, where they formed Bíró Pens of Argentina and filed a new patent in 1943. Their pen was sold in Argentina as the Birome (portmanteau of the names Bíró and Meyne), which is how ballpoint pens are still known in that country. This new design was licensed by the British, who produced ballpoint pens for RAF aircrew as the Biro. Ballpoint pens {{were found to be}} more versatile than <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> especially at high altitudes, where <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> were prone to ink-leakage.|$|E

25|$|The {{transition}} from an agricultural {{economy to a}} mixed economy happened slowly.

25|$|Capp portrayed {{himself in}} a cameo role in the Bob Hope film That Certain Feeling, for which he also {{provided}} promotional art. He was interviewed live on Person to Person on November 27, 1959, by host Charles Collingwood. He also appeared as himself on The Ed Sullivan Show, Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows, The Red Skelton Show, The Merv Griffin Show, The Mike Douglas Show, and guested on Ralph Edwards' This Is Your Life on February 12, 1961, with honoree Peter Palmer. Capp also freelanced very successfully as a magazine writer and newspaper columnist, {{in a wide variety}} of publications including Life, Show, Pageant, The Atlantic, Esquire, Coronet, and The Saturday Evening Post. Capp was impersonated by comedians Rich Little and David Frye. Although Capp's endorsement activities never rivaled Li'l Abner's or Fearless Fosdick's, he was a celebrity spokesman in print ads for Sheaffer Snorkel <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> (along with colleagues and close friends Milton Caniff and Walt Kelly), and—with an irony that would become apparent later—a brand of cigarettes, (Chesterfield).|$|E
500|$|Iridium–osmium alloys {{were used}} in {{fountain}} pen nib tips. The first major use of iridium was in 1834 in nibs mounted on gold. Since 1944, the famous Parker 51 fountain pen was fitted with a nib tipped by a ruthenium and iridium alloy (with 3.8% iridium). The tip material in modern <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> is still conventionally called [...] "iridium", although there is seldom any iridium in it; other metals such as ruthenium, osmium and tungsten have taken its place.|$|E
50|$|Many Lamy <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> models {{share the}} same type of feed and nib. Most use Fe-Ni-Cr {{stainless}} steel alloy Z 50 nibs which can be interchanged by the user.The feeds are made of ABS plastic and after injection molding are chemically etched with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The etching process causes micro surface scratches by removing styrene from the feed surface and ink channels. This roughening optimizes ink flow characteristics over the feed surface.The 2000 <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> model uses nibs of another type which is incompatible with Lamy's other <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> models.|$|R

500|$|Bich {{invested}} heavily in advertising, hiring poster designer Raymond Savignac in 1952. That year Bic won the French Oscar de la publicité award for advertising. In 1953 advertising executive Pierre Guichenné advised Bich to shorten his family name to Bic as an easy-to-remember, globally adaptable tradename for the pen, which fit in with product branding trends of the post-war era. Early Bic advertisements in France referred to the Cristal as the [...] "Atomic pen". Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the Bic Cristal's writing tip and ergonomic design helped shift the worldwide market for pens from <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> to ballpoints.|$|E
500|$|Because of the {{volatility}} and extreme toxicity of its oxide, osmium is rarely used in its pure state, but is instead often alloyed with other metals. Those alloys are utilized in high-wear applications. Osmium alloys such as osmiridium are very hard and, {{along with other}} platinum-group metals, {{are used in the}} tips of <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> instrument pivots, and electrical contacts, as they can resist wear from frequent operation. They were also used for the tips of phonograph styli during the late 78 rpm and early [...] "LP" [...] and [...] "45" [...] record era, circa 1945 to 1955. Although very durable compared to steel and chromium needle points, osmium-alloy tips wore out far more rapidly than competing, and costlier, sapphire and diamond tips and were discontinued.|$|E

5000|$|A dip pen (or nib pen) {{consists}} of a metal nib with capillary channels, {{like that of a}} <b>fountain</b> <b>pen,</b> mounted on a handle or holder, often made of wood. A dip pen usually has no ink reservoir and must be repeatedly recharged with ink while drawing or writing. The dip pen has certain advantages over a <b>fountain</b> <b>pen.</b> It can use waterproof pigmented (particle-and-binder-based) inks, such as so-called India ink, drawing ink, or acrylic inks, which would destroy a <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> by clogging, as well as the traditional iron gall ink, which can cause corrosion in a <b>fountain</b> <b>pen.</b> Dip pens are now mainly used in illustration, calligraphy, and comics. A particularly fine-pointed type of dip pen known as a crowquill is a favorite instrument of artists, such as David Stone Martin and Jay Lynch, because its flexible metal point can create a variety of delicate lines, textures and tones with slight pressures while drawing.|$|R
2500|$|One {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} Pitman shorthand is that unvoiced and voiced pairs of sounds (such as /p/ and /b/ or /t/ and /d/) {{are represented by}} strokes which differ only in thickness; the thin stroke representing [...] "light" [...] sounds such as /p/ and /t/; the thick stroke representing [...] "heavy" [...] sounds such as /b/ and /d/. Doing this requires a writing instrument responsive to the user's drawing pressure: specialist <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> (with fine, flexible nibs) were originally used, but pencils are now more commonly used.|$|E
2500|$|A ballpoint pen, {{also known}} as a biro, or ball pen, is a pen that {{dispenses}} ink over a metal ball at its point, i.e. over a [...] "ball point". The metal commonly used is steel, brass, or tungsten carbide. It was conceived and developed as a cleaner and more reliable alternative to dip pens and <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> and it is now the world's most-used writing instrument: millions are manufactured and sold daily. As a result, it has influenced art and graphic design and spawned an artwork genre.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first patent}} for a ballpoint pen was issued on 30 October 1888, to John J. Loud, who was {{attempting}} to make a writing instrument that {{would be able to}} write [...] "on rough surfaces-such as wood, coarse wrapping-paper, and other articles" [...] which then-common <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> could not. Loud's pen had a small rotating steel ball, held in place by a socket. Although it could be used to mark rough surfaces such as leather, as Loud intended, it proved to be too coarse for letter-writing. With no commercial viability, its potential went unexploited and the patent eventually lapsed.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{his close}} friend Milton Caniff's lead (with Steve Canyon), Capp had {{recently}} fought a successful {{battle with the}} syndicate to gain complete ownership of his feature when the Shmoos debuted. As a result, he reaped enormous financial rewards from the unexpected (and almost unprecedented) merchandising phenomenon that followed. As in the strip, Shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950—including a Time cover story. A paperback collection of the original sequence, The Life and Times of the Shmoo, became a bestseller for Simon & Schuster. Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, Halloween masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> and other shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in Baltimore turned out a whole line of shmoo apparel, including [...] "Shmooveralls." [...] The original sequence and its 1959 sequel, The Return of the Shmoo, have been collected in print many times since, most recently in 2011, always to high sales figures. The Shmoos would later have their own animated TV series.|$|E
