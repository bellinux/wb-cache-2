40|$|This article takes a {{new look}} at a {{perennial}} question of human rights: how to prevent corporate-related <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> abuses <b>and</b> provide remedies for victims. It argues that transnational corporations require specialized and targeted regulations and laws, and that the conflation of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law <b>and</b> international <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law should be reversed to allow the advancement of other forms of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law. It makes two proposals. First, reimagine <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law <b>and</b> international <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law as separate categories. Specifically, classify international <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law as a sub-category of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law. This distinction highlights the need to encourage the development of other forms of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law, for example, global <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law <b>and</b> national <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law. Second, establish global <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law as a sub-category of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law <b>and</b> create a new global <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> regime with three main elements: a Global Law Commission, global laws and regulations, and universal civil jurisdiction...|$|R

5|$|She {{identifies}} the UN as the book's villain and criticizes the UN's practise of moral equivalency that treats both sides equally even though {{one side is}} clearly dominant and brutally oppressive.

The book treats this as a reality of international relations, which places precedence on state sovereignty over <b>human</b> <b>rights,</b> <b>and</b> a factor in making the UN slow, ineffectual, and inappropriately bureaucratic. She notes that some peacekeepers cope by demonizing all sides which helps diminish the sense of impotence in being unable to intervene.|$|E
