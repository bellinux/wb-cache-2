6000|$|... [20] It seems {{never to}} have been rightly understood, even by the [...] more {{intelligent}} among our architects, that proportion is in any way [...] connected with positive size; {{it seems to be}} held among them that a [...] small building may be expanded to a large one merely by [...] proportionally expanding all its parts: and that the harmony will be [...] equally agreeable on whatever scale it be rendered. Now this is true [...] of apparent proportion, but utterly false of constructive; and, as [...] much of the value of architectural proportion is constructive, the [...] error is often productive of the most painful results. It may be [...] best illustrated by observing the conditions of proportion in [...] animals. Many persons have thoughtlessly claimed admiration for the [...] strength--supposed gigantic--of insects and smaller animals; because [...] capable of lifting weights, leaping distances, and surmounting [...] obstacles, of proportion apparently overwhelming. Thus the Formica [...] Herculanea will lift in its mouth, and brandish like a baton, sticks [...] thicker than itself and six times its length, all the while [...] scrambling over crags of about the proportionate height of the [...] Cliffs of Dover, three or four in a minute. There is nothing [...] extraordinary in this, nor any exertion of strength necessarily [...] greater than human, in proportion {{to the size of the}} body. For it is [...] evident that if the size and strength of any creature be expanded or [...] diminished in proportion to each other, the distance through which [...] it can leap, the time it can maintain exertion, or any other third [...] term resultant, remains constant; that is, diminish weight of powder [...] and of ball proportionately, and the <b>distance</b> <b>carried</b> is constant or [...] nearly so. Thus, a grasshopper, a man, and a giant 100 feet high, [...] supposing their muscular strength equally proportioned to their [...] size, can or could all leap, not proportionate distance, but the [...] same or nearly the same distance--say, four feet the grasshopper, or [...] forty-eight times his length; six feet the man or his length [...] exactly; ten feet the giant or the tenth of his length. Hence all [...] small animals can, coeteris paribus, perform feats of strength [...] and agility, exactly so much greater than those to be executed by [...] large ones, as the animals themselves are smaller; and to enable an [...] elephant to leap like a grasshopper, he must be endowed with [...] strength a million times greater in proportion to his size. Now [...] the consequence of this general mechanical law is, that as we [...] increase the scale of animals, their means of power, whether muscles [...] of motion or bones of support, must be increased in a more than [...] proportionate degree, or they become utterly unwieldy, and incapable [...] of motion;--and there is a limit to this increase of strength. If [...] the elephant had legs as long as a spider's, no combination of [...] animal matter that could be hide-bound would have strength enough to [...] move them: to support the megatherium, we must have a humerus a foot [...] in diameter, though perhaps not more than two feet long, and that in [...] a vertical position under him, while the gnat can hang on the window [...] frame, and poise himself to sting, in the middle of crooked stilts [...] like threads; stretched out to ten times the breadth of his body on [...] each side. Increase the size of the megatherium a little more, and [...] no phosphate of lime will bear him; he would crush his own legs to [...] powder. (Compare Sir Charles Bell, [...] "Bridgewater Treatise on the [...] Hand," [...] p. 296, and the note.) Hence there is not only a limit to the [...] size of animals, in the conditions of matter, but to their activity [...] also, the largest being always least capable of exertion; and this [...] would be the case to a far greater extent, but that nature [...] beneficently alters her proportions as she increases her scale; [...] giving, as we have seen, long legs and enormous wings to the smaller [...] tribes, and short and thick proportion to the larger. So in [...] vegetables--compare the stalk of an ear of oat, and the trunk of a [...] pine, the mechanical relations being in both the same. So also in [...] waves, of which the large never can be mere exaggerations of the [...] small, but have different slopes and curvatures: so in mountains and [...] all things else, necessarily, and from ordinary mechanical laws. [...] Whence in architecture, according to the scale of the building, its [...] proportions must be altered; and I have no hesitation in calling [...] that unmeaning exaggeration of parts in St. Peter's, of flutings, [...] volutes, friezes, etc., in the proportions of a smaller building, a [...] vulgar blunder, and one that destroys all the majesty that the [...] building ought to have had--and still more I should so call all [...] imitations and adaptations of large buildings on a small scale. The [...] true test of right proportion is that it shall itself inform us of [...] the scale of the building, and be such that even in a drawing it [...] shall instantly induce the conception of the actual size, or size [...] intended. I know not what Fuseli means by that aphorism of his:-- ...|$|E

5000|$|Once this {{behavior}} {{is known to}} the player, {{it can be used}} to great effect. For instance, a player may be faced with a hole incorporating a hazard just in front of the green.

5000|$|Though {{technically}} a wedge, pitching wedges {{are generally}} {{treated as if}} they were numbered irons. This is for a number of reasons: first, before the term [...] "wedge" [...] became common for high-loft short irons, the pitching wedge was actually numbered as the [...] "10-iron" [...] of a matched set, and to this day it follows the normal loft progression of the numbered irons. Also, even though it has been named a wedge, many matched iron sets for retail sale include the pitching wedge even when not including other wedges. Finally, the loft of modern irons has been reduced compared to older designs. This is both to compensate for cavity-back iron designs that launch the ball higher for a given loft, and to increase the <b>distance</b> <b>carried</b> by each club for the average golfer's clubhead speed. (Professionals now also use similar designs, preserving the gap in hitting distance between the amateur golfer and the pro.) As a result the loft of the pitching wedge decreased along with the numbered irons from a traditional loft of between 48-54° to between 45-50°, similar to that of an older 8-iron. Many pitching wedges have a loft close to 50°.|$|E
5000|$|Steamboats earned {{money by}} {{charging}} passengers fares and shippers for carrying cargo. Some vessels managed to carry {{as many as}} 500 people together with 500 tons of cargo. Passenger fares varied over time. In the early 1850s, fares for the Eagle, running from Oregon City and Portland, were $5 a trip for passengers and $15 per ton of freight. During a gold rush, passenger fares were $23 for passage from Portland to Wallula, with various other charges, such as meals, in addition. Cargo was charged by the ton and by the <b>distance</b> <b>carried.</b> Sample rates in the early 1860s, following {{the establishment of a}} near monopoly on river transit, showed cargo rates running from $15 per ton for the haul from Portland to The Dalles (121 mi), and 90 per ton for Portland to Lewiston (501) miles. A ton was not a unit of weight but a unit of volume, with cargo charges based on 40 cubic feet equalling one ton. Various chicaneries were practiced by the steamboat companies to increase the tonnage charges for items shipped. One authority states that gross tonnage was measured at 100 cubic feet to the ton, which would still permit the steamboat companies to fix the [...] "ton" [...] for customer charges at 40 cubic feet.|$|E

40|$|Interior Design is {{most often}} {{understood}} as concerned with the design or reform of the inside of buildings. In this way, an interior {{is defined by the}} enclosure of a building &ndash; the result of its containing architecture. The dominant association of the term &lsquo;interior&rsquo; is with ideas of location, containment or enclosure. It is my contention that this is unnecessarily restrictive and hinders the development of broader and far richer opportunities for the discipline. The central aim of this PhD is to develop an expanded practice of Interior Design, drawing on a more liberal understanding of interiority as a relational condition. This relational approach to Interior Design foregrounds the positioning of occupants relative to the physical and virtual conditions of a space, both perceived and experienced. A collaborative design practice titled Making Distance was established {{for the duration of the}} PhD. This practice developed participatory tools and techniques that embraced and extended a collaborative partnership with filmmakers, scriptwriters, other designers, and the public. Physical &lsquo;making&rsquo; of interiors was central to this practice-based research. Various self-initiated and commissioned projects (including constructed models, installations, exhibitions, and sets for film and television) supported a deliberate shift in medium and context to address the rhetorical nature of the work as both speculation and reflection. The body of work produced under the banner of Making <b>Distance</b> <b>carried</b> two research trajectories simultaneously: that of Negotiating Space and the Mediated Interior. Ultimately Making Distance acted as a framework and vehicle for a conversation between two designers, enacted through the medium of design. This research&rsquo;s major contribution to the discipline is to provide a methodological catalyst for further research by practice in interior design. It provokes a serious reassessment of the role of interior design. Eschewing restriction to the &lsquo;indoors&rsquo;, it suggests an expanded engagement in the design of our contemporary urban environment...|$|E
