40|$|The authors {{provide an}} {{empirical}} framework {{for assessing the}} effects of tax policy on an array of producer decisions about output supplies and input demands in Mexico, Pakistan, and Turkey. They specify and estimate a dynamic production structure model with imperfect competition for selected industries in these countries. The model results suggest that tax policy affected production and investment and further that selective tax incentives such as investment tax credits, <b>investment</b> <b>allowances,</b> and accelerated capital consumption (depreciation) allowances are more cost effective at promoting investment than more general tax incentives such as corporate tax rate reductions. The long run cost effectiveness of these incentives - except corporate tax rate reductions, which proved cost ineffective in all cases - varies by country. In Turkey, <b>investment</b> <b>allowances</b> and capital consumption allowances were cost effective. In Mexico, neither investment tax credits nor accelerated capital consumption allowances were cost effective. In contrast, in Pakistan, both investment tax credits and accelerated capital consumption allowances were cost effective. In the intermediate run, defined as tax policy impact after one year, only the <b>investment</b> <b>allowances</b> and accelerated capital consumption allowances available to Turkish industries proved cost effective. To make selective tax incentives more effective, investmenttax credits must be refundable and carrying forward investment depreciation allowances must be permitted. If stimulating investment expenditure is the sole objective of tax policy, reducing the corporate tax rate is not a cost effective instrument to achieve this objective.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to show that the scheme of <b>investment</b> <b>allowances</b> {{outlined}} below would be preferable to the present system of special depreciation allowances as a means of encouraging investment by primary producers, especially investment by low-income farmers. The need for increased primary production for balance of payments reasons is assumed and increased investment is the major means of bringing this about. (1) The main determinant of the ability of farmers to invest is the excess of their disposable incomes over the costs of maintaining a required standard of life. (2) The effectiveness of the above schemes depends largely upon the extent to which they increase these surpluses. The empirical studies to date suggest that special depreciation allowances have not been very effective in encouraging investment in primary production, especially by low-income farmers. (3) Furthermore, it appears that low-income farmers are not always aware of the existence of special depreciation allowances. (4) Their effectiveness is even further reduced by this ignorance. The article is in four sections. Section 1 contains a description of special depreciation allowances and of the proposed scheme of <b>investment</b> <b>allowances.</b> In the remaining sections the impact of both schemes on investment is analysed for different situations, and the relative merits of the two schemes are assessed.

40|$|The {{effect of}} tax {{policy on the}} process of capital {{accumulation}} has long been an important subject of policy debates and academic research. The tax policy debate in the 1980 s has been largely motivated by a concern over the rate of capital accumulation in the United States. Tax rules can affect the nation’s capital formation by influencing the return to saving and to investing in plant and equipment. However, the presence of international capital mobility requires policymakers to design tax incentives from a different perspective from that which would be taken in the case of immobile capital. Savings incentives and investment incentives can no longer be treated as alternative devices to enhance domestic capital formation. Part of domestic savings may flow into investment projects abroad, while domestic investment incentives can bring in more foreign capital. If long-term capital in particular is mobile across national boundaries, a country with higher domestic tax rates will drive domestic businesses abroad, while a country with generous <b>investment</b> <b>allowances</b> will attract more investments in plant and equipment...|$|E

In the case of standard tax systems (i. e. tax rules applying under normal circumstances), the effective tax rate reductions have not been larger than those witnessed in advanced economies, and revenues have held up well over the sample period. However, a race to the bottom is evident among special regimes, most notably in the case of Africa, creating effectively a parallel tax system where rates have fallen to almost zero. Regression analysis reveals higher tax rates adversely affect domestic investment and FDI, but do raise revenues in the short-run.

40|$|In {{the long}} term, {{productivity}} and especially productivity growth are necessary {{conditions for the}} survival of a farm. This paper focuses on the technology choice of a dairy farm, i. e. the choice between a conventional and an automatic milking system. Its aim is to reveal the extent to which economic rationality explains investing in new technology. The adoption of robotics is further linked to farm productivity to show how capital-intensive technology has affected the overall productivity of milk production. The empirical analysis applies a probit model and an extended Cobb-Douglas-type production function to a Finnish farm-level dataset for the years 2000 – 10. The results show that very few economic factors on a dairy farm or in its economic environment can be identified to affect the switch to automatic milking. Existing machinery capital and <b>investment</b> <b>allowances</b> are among the significant factors. The results also indicate that the probability of investing in robotics responds elastically to a change in investment aids: an increase of 1 % in aid would generate an increase of 2 % in the probability of investing. Despite the presence of non-economic incentives, the switch to robotic milking is proven to promote productivity development on dairy farms. No productivity growth is observed on farms that keep conventional milking systems, whereas farms with robotic milking have a growth rate of 8. 1 % per year. The mean rate for farms that switch to robotic milking is 7. 0 % per year. The results show great progress in productivity growth, with the average of the sector at around 2 % per year during the past two decades. In conclusion, investments in new technology as well as investment aids to boost investments are needed in low-productivity areas where investments in new technology still have great potential to increase productivity, and thus profitability and competitiveness, in the long run...|$|E

We calculate effective tax rates {{and find that}} general effective tax rates are relatively high in the Philippines, while investment incentives are comparable to those in neighboring countries. Tax holidays are most attractive for very profitable firms, creating redundancy, and for investment in short-lived assets. We also consider recently-proposed tax reforms that would replace tax holidays by a reduced corporate income tax rate or a low tax on gross receipts. The results suggest that this would result in stronger incentives to invest, while government revenue increases. Alternatively, replacing holidays with a general reduction in the corporate tax rate and offering accelerated depreciation will either not provide the same incentives or be very costly.

The second {{is concerned with the}} taxation of earnings of fixed capital. Each paper identifies shortcomings in the current treatment, proposes a new treatment, describes its computer implementation, and presents illustrative simulation results. The first paper proposes two changes relating to local ownership of fixed capital. * In calculating industry shares in aggregate capital stocks, we assume uniformity across industries not in pre-tax rates of return, but in post-tax rates. * In determining local ownership shares for individual industries, we do not assume changes in shares to be uniform across industries, but do require them to be jointly consistent with the change in the economy-wide average local ownership share. Illustrative simulation results show that the new treatment greatly increases the sensitivity of foreign income payments to changes in the economy-wide local ownership share. The second paper proposes several changes relating to taxation of earnings of fixed capital. * Tax reductions arising from depreciation and <b>investment</b> <b>allowances</b> are not apportioned between fixed capital, working capital, and land, but are allocated entirely to fixed capital. * The share of tax on earnings of fixed capital in total tax on non-labour income is not fixed, but varies in response to changes in the composition of non-labour income. * Investors treat the reduction in tax arising from the investment allowance not as an augmentation to their income, but as a partial offset to the purchase cost of capital. Illustrative simulation results show that the new treatment greatly increases the sensitivity of capital usage to changes in the depreciation and investment allowance. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} the user costs of capital, or its shadow price, plays a {{prominent}} role in the neoclassical theory of investment and constitutes a convenient vehicle for evaluating effects of corporate taxation on private business investment. This paper presents a derivation of the user cost of capital for Austria for the period of 1976 to 2000 and discusses methodological and statistical issues involved. Special care is taken to ensure the correct representation of the major fiscal instruments of Austria's system of corporate taxation in place at that time. These instruments comprise the business tax, the corporation tax, the depreciation <b>allowance</b> and the <b>investment</b> tax <b>allowance.</b> The spectrum of capital goods considered here encompasses machinery, vehicles, buildings and intangible capital goods. In addition, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the user cost of capital with respect to the aforementioned fiscal instruments is performed. Its results, coupled with empirical evidence on the sensitivity of private investment to user costs, provide the basis for fiscal policy evaluation in the field of corporate taxation. The basic measure used in the sensitivity analysis is semi-elasticity. The main findings can be summarised as follows: • Austria's corporate tax system is not investment-neutral, and its impact depends on the financial structure. Legislation particularly favours funding through borrowing. • A 1 percentage point increase in the business tax rate typically impacts as a 0. 34 percent decrease in investment made by the private sector. • The impact of the same increase in corporation tax is markedly weaker due to a fiscal provision that allows deducting interest payments on debt, amounting, on average, to a 0. 10 percent decrease in investment. In the benchmark case of investment funded exclusively by retained profit, the effect makes up – 0. 54 percent. • An increase in the rate of the <b>investment</b> tax <b>allowance</b> of the same magnitude induces, on average, 0. 36 percent more investment. • A 1 percentage point increase in the rate of depreciation allowance provides the strongest stimulus for private business investment, which is quantified at 2. 52 percent. All the above effects generally increase with the life span of the capital good. This certainly applies to depreciation allowance, taxes {{and to a lesser extent}} to <b>investment</b> <b>allowance.</b> Kapitalnutzungskosten in Österreich; The User Costs of Capital in Austria...|$|R
