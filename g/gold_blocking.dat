He was of pure <b>gold,</b> <b>blocking</b> the path of those who, with lead as their ornament, have trampled on him." [...] A posthumous volume of poetry was {{published}} in 1908 by Ștefan Octavian Iosif, with a preface by Iorga. These and other works appeared under the pen name T. Robeanu; the moniker originated with an 1885 pun addressed to his then-fiancée: Te robea, nu? ("He enslaved you, no?").|$|E
50|$|The {{result was}} {{published}} as The Art of Rosaleen Norton in 1952, and contained such paintings as Black Magic, Rites of Baron Samedi and an image depicting the horned demon Fohat, with a snake for his phallus, whilst Greenlees' poems {{featured in the}} work included The Angel of Twizzari and Esoteric Study. Restricted to a limited edition of 500 copies, The Art of Rosaleen Norton had been produced to a high quality, with each edition being bound in red leather with <b>gold</b> <b>blocking.</b> The book caused {{a great deal of}} controversy upon its release, and Glover was charged by police with the production of an obscene publication, with Norton being called into court to explain the nature of her works. The judge ruled that two of the images in the book, The Adversary and Fohat, did qualify as being obscene under Australian law, and that they had to be removed from all existing copies of the book. The authorities in the United States were even stricter, and actively destroyed any copies of the book that were imported into their country. The controversy had helped gain publicity for Norton's work, although the whole affair had bankrupted Glover, and the book's binder Alan Cross, realising that he would never get paid, was instead given his pick of Norton's work, for which he chose Fohat.|$|E

From her collection of French and English paperbacks of Flaubert's book, Kivland has assembled the covers, and two annotated pages (French and English), in which Emma's appearance is described for the first time, Her book has two versions, a cheap softback, and a luxury hardback edition, with red endpapers and <b>gold</b> <b>blocking.</b> She describe this as the difference between Emma dead and Emma alive...|$|E

On the outermost borders of front cover are two continuous fillets blocked in black, the inner fillet being in a dogtooth pattern, the outer plain. Inside this there is a double fillet rectangular border blocked in gold, crossed by two additional horizontal double fillets of identical pattern to create outer rectangular panels and a central square panel. Within the double fillets there is a repeating pattern of dots within circles blocked in gold. At corner intersections of these double fillets and at the centre-point between the intersections there are squares blocked in black. At {{each of the four}} corners is a quatrefoil consisting of a border blocked in gold and black surrounding a central onlay of blue paper. The quatrefoils contain Greek characters as follows: top left and bottom left:'|ΙΣ|'; top right and bottom right: '|ΧΣ|'. The upper rectangular panel contains the words: '| THE SERMON |' blocked in gold; the lower rectangular panel: '| ON THE MOUNT |'. The square central panel contains an elaborate cross formy the terminations of whose arms, head and foot are invected. Its centerpiece is an eight-petalled flower shape of pale blue paper onlay, surrounded by two fillets of the same shape blocked in gold, between which is a repeating pattern of dots blocked in gold on a red background. At the centre of the blue flower motif is a disc bordered by interpenetrating dentellated circles the outer blocked in gold, the inner in black, both bordered by a circle in red. The inner disc contains a representation of the paschal lamb nimbused and carrying a staff ending in a cross at the head of which is a white pennon charged with a red cross.

40|$|International audiencefield-based {{estimate}} of the zircon fission-track closure temperature is proposed from 13 zircon fission-track cooling ages of the <b>Gold</b> Butte <b>block,</b> SE Nevada. Using previously published and new thermochronological data, the thermal history of the <b>Gold</b> Butte <b>block</b> is re-evaluated, resulting in a geothermal-gradient {{estimate of}} 20. 3 °C/km and a slow cooling rate of 0. 55 ± 0. 02 °C/m. y. from the Late Jurassic to the early Miocene before onset of rapid Miocene cooling. The rapidly cooled part of the <b>Gold</b> Butte <b>block</b> provides a slip rate of 10. 5 km/m. y. of the hanging wall that caused the Miocene exhumation of this crustal section. Assuming these thermal conditions are correct, the closure temperature of the zircon fission-track system is determined at 205 ± 18 °C, which is in good agreement with previous field-based estimates. Because {{of the variation in}} zircon fission-track annealing behavior with radiation damage, field studies are a suitable way to calibrate the closure temperature of the zircon fission-track system...|$|R
