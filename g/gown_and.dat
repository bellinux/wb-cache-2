5|$|The costumes were {{designed}} by Anthony Mendleson, who matched Louis's rise through the social ranks with his changing costumes. When employed as a shop assistant, Louis's suit was ill-fitting and drab; he is later seen in tailored suits with satin lapels, wearing a brocade dressing <b>gown</b> <b>and</b> waiting for his execution in a quilted-collar velvet jacket. Mendleson later recounted that to dress Guinness in his many roles, the costumes were of less importance than make-up and the actor's nuances.|$|E

40|$|Two {{patients}} with postoperative granulomatous peritonitis {{were found to}} have lesions with a distinctive type of foreign body. Laboratory investigation revealed this foreign body to be cellulose, morphologically identical with fibers derived from disposable surgical <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> drapes, and cotton. The same type of foreign body granulomas was produced experimentally by introducing lint prepared from these <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> drapes into the peritoneal cavities of rats. Since disposable <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> drapes are being used with increasing frequency, cellulose lint derived from these sources should be added to the list of hazardous foreign materials which are potential wound contaminants...|$|R

5|$|The main {{intention}} of the tour was to transform Madonna's old hits musically and display her capacity for transformation and self-reflection. The tour was initially known as the Whore of Babylon World Tour, although Madonna later denied using this name. The idea was to portray Madonna as the Whore of Babylon, the figure of evil as mentioned in the Book of Revelation. However it was later changed to the Re-Invention World Tour, {{to make it a}} self-confident dig at all the critics and people who have expressed their views about Madonna re-inventing her image over the years. The official tour poster displayed Madonna in a vintage bolero <b>gown</b> <b>and</b> a large French Renaissance-like hair-bun. Air-conditioning was turned off during the tour on Madonna's request as she claimed it dried up her throat during singing.|$|E
5|$|During her {{shows at}} the Tokyo Dome during 1996, Carey sported a long and wavy hairstyle, while wearing a long black gown. She sang the {{original}} version of the song, up until halfway through the last chorus, until merging into the C+C remix. Several background vocalists were once again featured on stage, all donning black garbs. However, once the remix began, six male dancers {{made their way to}} the right and left sides of the stage, performing heavy dance routines as Carey walked around the stage. Once the remix began, the lighting was altered. Aside from the usual fluorescent lighting that was used throughout the show, additional pink and purple lighting was added for the number, as it served for the shows closing and final song. During her succeeding shows in Europe, Carey's outfits altered as well as her hairstyle. She wore a long, white strapless <b>gown</b> <b>and</b> sported her hair in a straightened ponytail style. Since 1996, Carey has not performed the song live on television or on her tours.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{alternate}} video {{features a}} similar synopsis, where Houston begins singing the song {{on a large}} stone altar {{in the middle of}} an auditorium. As she finishes her verse, Carey is seen walking up the ramp in the background, joining Houston for her verse. They continue singing the song together, standing side by side and holding hands. After completing the song, both singers exit the auditorium together as in the first video, simulating two friends enjoying time with each other. Both videos are very similar, only the alternate version does not feature an audience, choir or images, only the duo singing together atop the stone altar. In this version of the video, Houston wears a long brown strapless <b>gown,</b> <b>and</b> features a shoulder length bob haircut. Carey on the otherhand, features long cascading curls and dons an olive green gown.|$|E

40|$|Hospitals will {{continue}} to be the largest consumers of disposables, because of the diverse range of procedures they provide. Favourable growth is forecast for nonwovens. Increasing concern over contamination and nosocomial infections will boost the demand for consumables <b>and</b> disposables surgical <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> drapes. But, until now neither the manufacturers nor the end users of surgical <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> drapes could agree on standards. So, a mandatory European standard is being developed to establish basic requirements and test methods for disposable and reusable materials used for surgical <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> drapes. Once this standard has been adopted, the continued use of cotton textiles and conventional cotton-polyester mixed textiles will become questionable...|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white <b>gown</b> <b>and</b> singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and <b>gown,</b> <b>and</b> performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|Upstairs in the house, Kung Fu and Prof find Gorgeous {{wearing a}} bridal gown, who then reveals her aunt's diary to them.

Prof tries to read the diary to solve the problem, but is pulled under the blood by a monster jar. Fantasy sees Gorgeous in the bridal <b>gown</b> <b>and</b> paddles towards her.
