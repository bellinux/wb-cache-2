5|$|The {{first class}} arrived in fall 1927. The {{incoming}} Experimental College class was more diverse than the larger university's population. One third of students hailed from Wisconsin (as opposed to 90 {{percent in the}} university), most were from urban areas (the East Coast had particularly strong representation), one third were second-generation immigrants, and Meiklejohn estimated their Jewish population at 40 percent. The College was all-male, {{due in part to}} space availability and the regents' refusal of mixed-sex living arrangements, in keeping with American college conventions. The students were largely well-versed in current affairs, with <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> entrance exams and lower high school grades than their UW counterparts. Meiklejohn appreciated the challenges of reconciling this diversity and related this task to those facing the country's democratic governance.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead {{exposure in}} childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E

40|$|Objectives—This report {{examines}} {{two measures}} that identify children with {{emotional and behavioral}} problems: <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> based <b>on</b> questions in the brief version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and a single question about serious (definite or severe) overall emotional and behavioral difficulties. Children were classified into four groups, those with: only <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the brief SDQ, only serious overall difficulties, both <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the brief SDQ and serious overall difficulties, and neither <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> brief SDQ nor serious overall difficulties. Children’s characteristics, conditions, and service use in these four groups were compared. Methods—Data from the 2001 – 2007 National Health Interview Survey identified the emotional and behavioral problems, characteristics, conditions, and service use of children aged 4 – 17 years. Results—Approximately 7 % of children had either <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the brief SDQ or serious overall difficulties, with 2 % having only <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the brief SDQ, 3 % having only serious overall difficulties, and 2 % having both <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the brief SDQ and serious overall difficulties.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the relationship between functions of school refusal behavior and internalizing and externalizing symptom sets in a community sample of 200 youth and parents recruited from two truancy settings. The first hypothesis was that youth who endorsed refusing school primarily to avoid stimuli that provoke negative affectivity (function 1) would report more symptoms of generalized anxiety and depression. The second hypothesis was that youth who endorsed refusing school primarily to escape from aversive social or evaluative situations (function 2) would report more symptoms of social anxiety. The third hypothesis was that youth who endorsed refusing school primarily due to attention-getting behavior (function 3) would report more symptoms of separation anxiety. The fourth hypothesis was that parents who reported that their child refused school primarily due to pursuit of tangible reinforcement outside of school (function 4) would report more symptoms of oppositional behavior. <b>High</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> function 1 were associated with higher generalized anxiety and depression symptom <b>scores.</b> Similarly, <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> function 2 predicted <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> social anxiety symptoms, and <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> function 3 predicted <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> separation iv anxiety symptoms. Finally, parent report demonstrated that <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> function 4 predicted <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> oppositional behavior. These results provide important clinical implications regarding assessment and treatment of youth with school refusal behavior in community settings...|$|R

25|$|Next to {{predicting}} a group's performance on more complex criterion tasks {{as shown in}} the original experiments, the collective intelligence factor c was also found to predict group performance in diverse tasks in MBA classes lasting over several months.

Moreover, highly collective intelligent teams improved performance over time suggesting that more collectively intelligent teams learn better. This is another potential parallel to individual intelligence where more intelligent people are found to acquire new material quicker.|$|E
25|$|The {{free market}} {{viewpoint}} defines economic liberty as {{the freedom to}} produce, trade and consume any goods and services acquired {{without the use of}} force, fraud or theft. This is embodied in the rule of law, property rights and freedom of contract, and characterized by external and internal openness of the markets, the protection of property rights and freedom of economic initiative.

Empirical studies based on these rankings have found higher living standards, economic growth, income equality, less corruption and less political violence to be correlated with <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the country rankings. It has been argued that the economic freedom indices conflate together unrelated policies and policy outcomes to conceal negative correlations between economic growth and economic freedom in some subcomponents.|$|E

25|$|Molecular genetic {{research}} into alexithymia remains minimal, but promising candidates {{have been identified}} from studies examining connections between certain genes and alexithymia among those with psychiatric conditions {{as well as the}} general population. A study recruiting a test population of Japanese males found <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the Toronto Alexithymia Scale among those with the 5-HTTLPR homozygous long (L) allele. The 5-HTTLPR region on the serotonin transporter gene influences the transcription of the seretonin transporter that removes serotonin from the synaptic cleft, and is well studied for its association with numerous psychiatric disorders. Another study examining the 5-HT1A receptor, a receptor that binds serotonin, found higher levels of alexithymia among those with the G allele of the Rs6295 polymorphism within the HTR1A gene. Also, a study examining alexithymia in subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder found higher alexithymia levels associated with the Val/Val allele of the Rs4680 polymorphism in the gene that encodes Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme which degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine. These links are tentative, and further research will be needed to clarify how these genes relate to the neurological anomalies found in the brains of people with alexithymia.|$|E

40|$|Sixteen {{statements}} on physician attitudes in the physician-patient relationship {{were presented to}} {{a representative sample of}} Norwegian physicians (N= 990). Three moderately correlated theoretical dimensions were identified in a principal component analysis: paternalism, patient autonomy, and moral deliberation. The paternalism scores increased significantly with age, and psychiatrists scored significantly lower than physicians in somatic specialties. Psychiatrists had the <b>highest</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the patient autonomy dimension, whereas surgeons scored the lowest. Moral deliberation scores increased slightly with age. To explore the pattern of scores across the three dimensions, the scores were dichotomized and combined in eight different ways. The resulting typology included five different physician profiles: (1) classical paternalists (<b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> paternalism, low <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> both patient autonomy and moral deliberation), (2) modern paternalists (<b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> both paternalism and deliberation, low <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> patient autonomy), (3) autonomists (<b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> patient autonomy, low <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> both paternalism and deliberation), (4) deliberationists (<b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> deliberation and patient autonomy, low <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> paternalism), and (5) ambivalents (<b>high</b> or low <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> all dimensions, or <b>high</b> or low <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> both paternalism and patient autonomy). The four groups of physicians with 'consistent' attitudes contained between 12 and 19 % of the total sample, whereas 37 % belonged to the 'ambivalent' group. Laboratory doctors and surgeons belonged significantly more often in the group of classical paternalists than did general practitioners, whereas male physicians were more often modern paternalists than were female physicians. Among the autonomists, women were more numerous than men, doctors in their 40 s clearly more numerous than those in their 60 s, and psychiatrists clearly more numerous than residents.
