5|$|The {{will of the}} Swedish {{inventor}} Alfred Nobel {{established the}} prizes in 1895. The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901. Medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold, and later from 18 carat <b>green</b> <b>gold</b> plated with a 24 carat gold coating. Between 1901 and 2016, the Nobel Prizes and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 579 times to 911 people and organisations. With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once, this makes a total of 23 organisations, and 881 individuals.|$|E
25|$|The College's {{colors were}} changed to <b>green,</b> <b>gold</b> and silver. The colors {{came from the}} College's coat of arms. The change was officially made so that the College and {{athletic}} colors would be identical.|$|E

5000|$|The club is best {{associated}} with dark <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> colours; but, it wore {{blue and white}} as a junior club, and in its first three seasons in the VFA, before changing to <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> in 1911 to distinguish itself from [...] It also wore maroon guernseys {{for a few years}} following World War I due to the unavailability of <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> wool at the time. Until around 1975 the club's guernseys were <b>green</b> with a <b>gold</b> 'V' neck, however moved to <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> vertical stripes as this was considered to look better on colour TV which had just been introduced to Australia.|$|R
40|$|The drying {{characteristics}} of <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> kiwifruit were determined using an air velocity of 0. 20 m/s at ambient humidity and different temperatures (60, 80 and 100 °C). The colour values (L*, a* and b*) and ascorbic acid content were also measured {{for the different}} fresh and dried kiwifruits. The drying of <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> kiwifruit slices consists of a constant rate period (CRP) and two parts of falling rate period (FRP). The CRP drying rate, first and second FRP drying coefficients increase with drying temperature for both the <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> kiwifruit slices. The first critical moisture content (CMC) and the dynamic equilibrium MC decrease with drying temperature for both the <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> kiwifruit slices. The second CMC for both <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> kiwifruit slices were not affected by drying temperature. The values for chroma of the dried green kiwifruit increased while the dried gold kiwifruit decreased with higher temperature {{as compared with the}} fresh samples. The values for hue angle of dried <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> kiwifruits decreased at higher temperature. Lastly, the values for browning index of dried <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> kiwifruits increased at higher temperature. There was not much change on the ascorbic acid contents of fresh and dried <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> kiwifruits when drying at 60 and 80 °C. But there was about 19 % decrease in the ascorbic acid content of dried <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> kiwifruits after drying at 100 °C...|$|R

25|$|Electrum is a {{naturally}} occurring alloy {{of gold and}} silver, with trace amounts of copper and other metals. It has also been produced artificially, and is often known as <b>green</b> <b>gold.</b> The ancient Greeks called it 'gold' or 'white gold', as opposed to 'refined gold'. Its colour ranges from pale to bright yellow, depending on the proportions of gold and silver.|$|E
25|$|The match {{ball for}} the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final, {{announced}} on 29 May 2014, featured {{a variation of}} the Adidas Brazuca named the Adidas Brazuca Final Rio. Whilst the technical aspects of the ball were the same, the design was different from the Brazuca balls used in the group stages and other playoffs, with a <b>green,</b> <b>gold</b> and black coloring. It was the third special ball for FIFA World Cup final matches, after the +Teamgeist Berlin (2006) and the Jo'bulani (2010).|$|E

50|$|The 1984-1990 Australian teams wore a {{traditional}} Australian rules sleeveless guernsey in plain gold. The teams of 1998-2011 wore a predominantly navy blue gaelic football style guernsey, {{with either a}} <b>green</b> or <b>gold</b> v or <b>green</b> and <b>gold</b> sash. The Indigenous All Stars team which represented Australia in 2013 wore a unique Indigenous-styled guernsey.

25|$|Electrum {{was used}} {{as early as the}} third {{millennium}} BCE in Old Kingdom of Egypt, sometimes as an exterior coating to the pyramidions atop ancient Egyptian pyramids and obelisks. It was also used in the making of ancient drinking vessels. The first metal coins ever made were of electrum and date back {{to the end of the}} 7th century or the beginning of the 6th century BCE. For several decades, the medals awarded with the Nobel Prize have been made of gold-plated <b>green</b> <b>gold.</b>|$|E
25|$|The cinema's {{red brick}} {{exterior}} {{was designed to}} harmonise with the adjoining Turnpike Lane tube station. Above the main canopy over the entrance was an illuminated sign above which {{the name of the}} cinema was displayed in neon. The auditorium's decorative scheme was quite simple and consisted mainly of ornamental plasterwork decorated in <b>green,</b> <b>gold</b> and pink. There was a large cove-lit dome in the ceiling and seating was provided for 1,850 people. The cinema was also equipped with a stage, which was only occasionally used, and a cafe that was located over the entrance foyer in operation until the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Several {{images and}} symbols are {{used during the}} {{commemoration}} of the Victory of Adwa, including the tri-coloured <b>Green,</b> <b>Gold</b> and Red Ethiopian flag, images of Emperor Menelik II and Empress Taytu Betul, {{as well as other}} prominent kings and war generals of the time including King Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam, King Michael of Wollo, Dejazmach Balcha Safo, Fitawrari Habte Giyorgis Dinagde, and Fitawrari Gebeyehu, among others. Surviving members of the Ethiopian patriotic battalions wear the various medals that they collected for their participation during different battle fields. Young people often wear T-shirts adorned by Emepror Menelik II, Empress Taytu, Emperor Haile Selassie and other notable members of the Ethiopian monarchy. Popular and patriotic songs are often played on amplifiers. Of particular note are Ejigayehu Shibabaw’s ballad dedicated to the Battle of Adwa and Teddy Afro’s popular song “Tikur Sew”, which literally translates to “black man or black person” – a poetic reference to Emperor Menelik II’s decisive African victory over Europeans, as well as the Emperor’s darker skin complexion.|$|E

A Comet 4C (SA-R-7) was ordered by Saudi Arabian Airlines with eventual disposition to the Saudi Royal Flight for the exclusive use of King Saud bin Abdul Aziz. Extensively modified at the factory, the aircraft included a VIP front cabin, a bed, special toilets with gold fittings and was distinguished by a <b>green,</b> <b>gold</b> and white colour scheme with polished wings and lower fuselage that was commissioned from aviation artist John Stroud. Following its first flight, the special order Comet 4C was described as [...] "the world's first executive jet." ...|$|E
500|$|All medals {{made before}} 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold. Since then, {{they have been}} struck in 18 carat <b>green</b> <b>gold</b> plated with 24 carat gold. The weight of each medal varies with the value of gold, but averages about [...] for each medal. The {{diameter}} is [...] and the thickness varies between [...] and [...] Because of the high value of their gold content and tendency to be on public display, Nobel medals are subject to medal theft. During World War II, the medals of German scientists Max von Laue and James Franck were sent to Copenhagen for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark, Hungarian chemist (and Nobel laureate himself) George de Hevesy dissolved them in aqua regia (nitro-hydrochloric acid), to prevent confiscation by Nazi Germany and to prevent legal problems for the holders. After the war, the gold was recovered from solution, and the medals re-cast.|$|E
2500|$|The colors {{traditionally}} {{associated with}} Mardi Gras in New Orleans are <b>green,</b> <b>gold,</b> and purple. The colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts {{suggest that they}} were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism.|$|E

2500|$|Errol Laborde, {{author of}} Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, {{presented}} {{a theory that}} the colors were based on heraldry; all three colors fall within those of tincture, and that if Rex's goal were to create a tricolor to represent their [...] "kingdom", purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in <b>green,</b> <b>gold</b> and purple in that order complies with the rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.|$|E
2500|$|The old {{flag of the}} African Union bears a broad green {{horizontal}} stripe, {{a narrow}} band of gold, the emblem of the African Union at the centre of a broad white stripe, another narrow gold band and a final broad green stripe. Again, the green and gold symbolise Africa's hopes and aspirations {{as well as its}} wealth and bright future, and the white represents the purity of Africa's desire for friends throughout the world. The flag has {{led to the creation of}} the [...] "national colours" [...] of Africa of gold and green (sometimes together with white). These colours are visible in one way or another in the flags of many African nations. Together the colours <b>green,</b> <b>gold,</b> and red constitute the Pan-African colours.|$|E
2500|$|Haas {{set about}} {{changing}} the team's image. He ditched Charlie O. as the team mascot and restored the traditional team name of [...] "Athletics" [...] {{as soon as he}} closed on the purchase, with the ownership group formally known as [...] "The Oakland Athletics Baseball Company." [...] He also installed pictures of Connie Mack and other greats from the Philadelphia days in the team office; Finley had scarcely acknowledged the team's past. [...] While the team colors remained <b>green,</b> <b>gold,</b> and white, the bright Kelly green was replaced with a more subdued forest green. After a 23-year hiatus, the elephant was restored as the club mascot in 1988. The script [...] "Athletics", which had adorned home and road jerseys from 1954–1960, was returned to home jerseys in 1987.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{surrounded}} at its upper part by 139 lusterware tiles (with a metallic sheen), {{each one is}} 21.1 centimeters square and they are arranged on the diagonal in a chessboard pattern. Divided into two groups, they are dated {{from the beginning of}} the second half of the ninth century but it is not determined with certainty whether they were made in Baghdad or in Kairouan by a Baghdadi artisan, the controversy over the origin of this precious collection agitates the specialists. These tiles are mainly decorated with floral and plant motifs (stylized flowers, palm leaves and asymmetrical leaves on bottom hatch and checkered) belong to two series : one polychrome characterized by a greater richness of tones ranging from light gold to light, dark or ocher yellow, and from brick-red to brown lacquer, the other monochrome is a beautiful luster that goes from smoked gold to <b>green</b> <b>gold.</b> The coating around them is decorated with blue plant motifs dating from the eighteenth century [...] or the first half of the nineteenth century. The horseshoe arch of the mihrab, stilted and broken at the top, rest on two columns of red marble with yellow veins, which surmounted with Byzantine style capitals that carry two crossbeams carved with floral patterns, each one is decorated with a Kufic inscription in relief.|$|E
2500|$|As the London Nationals, the Knights {{originally}} {{played in}} the blue and white of the Toronto Maple Leafs. The team's logo was the same Leaf as used by the parent club at the time, except with the words [...] "London Nationals" [...] written out across the leaf instead of [...] "Toronto Maple Leafs". After 1968, the colours changed to <b>green,</b> <b>gold</b> and white, and the logo to a classically inspired Knight's head with an Old English [...] "K" [...] on the helmet. In 1980 the striping changed slightly, from classical horizontal stripes around the sleeves {{and bottom of the}} sweater to large arm stripes and a bare sweater bottom. In 1985–86 the green on the uniforms was darkened and the arm stripes were deleted in favour of broad swathes of secondary colour across the shoulders and down the arms. 1986 saw a total re-design of sweater and logo. Black was added as a secondary colour and the striping returned to a more pedestrian design. The logo was also changed, from a classical Knight's head to a more modernized version on a gold circle with the letter [...] "L". These uniforms were used until 1994. In 1994 the green and gold were disposed of completely in favour of the eggplant and teal used by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The logo was changed to [...] "Spiderknight", with normal horizontal striping and pointed shoulder stripes. There was also a teal shoulder patch bearing the word [...] "London" [...] and a hockey stick. In February 2002, the Knights reverted to their 1986–94 uniforms as a commemoration of the closing of the London Gardens. The special uniforms were identical except for two shoulder patches, one bearing the 1968–86 logo and the other bearing the 1994–2002 logo. These uniforms were also used for the 2002–03 preseason. For the opening of the John Labatt Centre in October 2002, the Knights debuted new uniforms with the 1986–94 logo, minus the [...] "L" [...] and the gold circle. These were drawn on a home white uniform and a road uniform that, {{for the first time in}} team history, bore black as its primary colour. Each uniform also bore a new [...] "shield" [...] shoulder patch. The team also debuted green third jerseys, which featured the word [...] "KNIGHTS" [...] printed diagonally across the front of the sweater.|$|E
60|$|Then {{came the}} colour riot, the {{dominant}} tone {{of which was}} green. It was green, green, green--the blue-green of the springing year, and sere and yellow green and tawny-brown green of autumn. There were orange <b>green,</b> <b>gold</b> green, and a copper green. And all these greens were rich green beyond description; and yet the richness and the greenness passed even as we gazed upon it, going out of the gray clouds and into the sea, which assumed the exquisite golden pink of polished copper, while the hollows of the smooth and silken ripples were touched by a most ethereal pea green.|$|E
