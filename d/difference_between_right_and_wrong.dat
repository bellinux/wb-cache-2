25|$|In October 1938, Straffen was {{referred}} to a child guidance clinic for stealing and truancy. In June 1939, he first came before a juvenile court for stealing a purse from a girl and was given two years probation. His probation officer found that Straffen {{did not understand the}} <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> or the meaning of probation. The family was living in crowded lodgings at the time, and Straffen's mother had no time to help, so the probation officer took the boy to a psychiatrist. As a result, Straffen was certified as a mental defective under the Mental Deficiency Act 1927. A report was compiled on him in 1940 which gave his Intelligence Quotient as 58 and placed his mental age at six. From June 1940, the local council sent him to a residential school for mentally defective children, St Joseph's School in Sambourne.|$|E
500|$|Churches of Christ are {{strongly}} anti-Calvinist in {{their understanding of}} salvation and generally present conversion as [...] "obedience to the proclaimed facts of the gospel rather than {{as the result of}} an emotional, Spirit-initiated conversion". Churches of Christ hold the view that humans of accountable age are lost because they have committed sins. These lost souls can be redeemed because Jesus Christ, the Son of God, offered Himself as the atoning sacrifice. Children too young to understand right from wrong and make a conscious choice between the two, are believed to be innocent of sin. There is no set [...] "age" [...] for this to occur; it is only when the child learns the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong</b> that they are accountable (...)

Returning to normal social activities, he is disconcerted {{to see one of}} his former clients at a school science fair. Orson is worried for Andrew, which Bree notices and asks him about later that night. Wanting no secrets, Orson confesses that Andrew sold himself for money, and that the man he had been talking to was a {{previous}} client. Bree, shocked, and a friend of the man's wife, confesses all to her. She takes it badly, and tells Bree in return that Danielle is sleeping with her history teacher. Later, Andrew watches the tail end of her argument with Danielle and, concerned, he tries to comfort Bree, explaining that she did instill moral values, [...] "I mean, we know the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> we just chose wrong", but also that she pushed them so hard they had to rebel. Bree tries to subtly get him to talk about his prostitution, but he gently brushes her off. Andrew has since got a job working at Tom's pizzeria, though he takes a fairly lax attitude to his work.|$|E
2500|$|The Book of Jonah, set in {{the days}} of the Assyrian empire, {{describes}} it (ff; [...] ) as an [...] "exceedingly great city of three days journey in breadth", whose population at that time is given as [...] "more than 120,000". But it is also possible that it took three days to cover all its neighborhoods by walking, which would match the size of ancient Nineveh. The ruins of Kouyunjik, Nimrud, Karamles and Khorsabad form the four corners of an irregular quadrangle. The ruins of Nineveh, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as consisting of these four sites. The Book of Jonah depicts Nineveh as a wicked city worthy of destruction. God sent Jonah to preach to the Ninevites of their coming destruction, and they fasted and repented because of this. As a result, God spared the city; when Jonah protests against this, God states He is showing mercy for the population who are ignorant of the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong</b> ("who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand" [...] ) and mercy for the animals in the city.|$|E
2500|$|Also, the [...] "relationship between mental {{retardation}} and the penological purposes {{served by the}} death penalty" [...] justifies a conclusion that executing the mentally retarded is {{cruel and unusual punishment}} that the Eighth Amendment should forbid. In other words, unless it can be shown that executing the mentally retarded promotes the goals of retribution and deterrence, doing so is nothing more than [...] "purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering", making the death penalty cruel and unusual in those cases. Being mentally retarded means that a person not only has substandard intellectual functioning but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction. These deficiencies typically manifest before the age of eighteen. Although they can know the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> these deficiencies mean they have a lesser ability to learn from experience, engage in logical reasoning, and understand the reactions of others. This means that inflicting the death penalty on one mentally retarded individual is less likely to deter other mentally retarded individuals from committing crimes. As for retribution, society's interest in seeing that a criminal get his [...] "just desserts" [...] means that the death penalty must be confined to the [...] "most serious" [...] of murders, not simply the average murder. The goal of retribution is not served by imposing the death penalty on {{a group of people who}} have a significantly lesser capacity to understand why they are being executed.|$|E

50|$|Setback is the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> side <b>and</b> {{left side}} {{wheelbase}} length. It {{can also be}} measured as an angle. Setback less than the manufacturer specified tolerance (for example about 6mm) does not affect car handling. That's because, when the vehicle is turning, one wheel is ahead of the other by several centimetres and therefore the setback is negligible. There are even some car models with different factory setting for <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left side wheelbase length, for various design reasons. An off-spec setback may occur because of a collision or a <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left caster.|$|R
2500|$|The defense's chief {{expert witness}} was Fredric Wertham, a {{psychiatrist}} {{with an emphasis}} on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts. During two days of testimony, Wertham explained Fish's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22:1–24). Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly [...] "sacrificing" [...] a boy would be penance for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but {{he turned out to be}} larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy. Wertham then detailed Fish's cannibalism, which in his mind he associated with communion. The last question Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered [...] "He is insane". Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong.</b> He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement and religion and thus was an [...] "insane knowledge". The defense called two more psychiatrists to support Wertham's findings.|$|E

6000|$|First, says Florence [...] "I willed, (in {{sense of}} resolutely desiring,) and Sense was given me."

This choice is offered to every youth and maid at some moment of their life;--choice between the easy downward road, so broad that we can dance down it in companies, and the steep narrow way, which we must enter alone. Then, and for many a day afterwards, they need that form of persistent Option, and Will: but day by day, the 'Sense' of the rightness of what they have done, deepens on them, not in consequence of the effort, but by gift granted in reward of it.

6000|$|Still, {{even when}} thus understood, {{there is much}} in the anecdote very curious. Here is a painter {{requested}} {{by the head of}} the Church to execute certain religious paintings, and the only qualification for the task of which he deigns to demonstrate his possession is executive skill. Nothing is said, and nothing appears to be thought, of expression, or invention, or devotional sentiment. Nothing is required but firmness of hand. And here arises the important question: Did Giotto know that this was all that was looked for by his religious patrons? and is there occult satire in the example of his art which he sends them?--or does the founder of sacred painting mean to tell us that he holds his own power to consist merely in firmness of hand, secured by long practice? I cannot satisfy myself on this point: but yet {{it seems to me that}} we may safely gather two conclusions from the words of the master, [...] "It is enough, and more than enough." [...] The first, that Giotto had indeed a profound feeling of the value of precision in all art; and that we may use the full force of his authority to press the truth, of which it is so difficult to persuade the hasty workmen of modern times, that the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong</b> lies within the breadth of a line; and that the most perfect power and genius are shown by the accuracy which disdains error, and the faithfulness which fears it.|$|E
60|$|All {{this was}} Mr. Gladstone in Midlothian. To {{think of the}} {{campaign}} without the scene, is as who should read a play by candle-light among the ghosts of an empty theatre. When the climax came, {{it was found that}} Mr. Gladstone’s tremendous projectiles had pounded the ministerial citadel to the ground, and that he had a nation at his back. What had been vague misgiving about Lord Beaconsfield grew into sharp certainty; shadows of doubt upon policy at Constantinople or Cabul or the Cape, became substantive condemnation; uneasiness as to the national finances turned to active resentment; and above all, the people of this realm, who are a people with rather more than their share of conscience at bottom, were led to consider whether when all is said, there is not still a <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong</b> even in the relations of states and the problems of empire. It was this last trait that made the atmosphere in which both speaker and his hearers drew their inspiration. It may be true, if we will, that, as a great critic sardonically hints, “eloquence, without being precisely a defect, {{is one of the worst}} dangers that can beset a man.”(360) Yet after all, to disparage eloquence is to depreciate mankind; and when men say that Mr. Gladstone and Midlothian were no better than a resplendent mistake, they forget how many objects of our reverence stand condemned by implication in their verdict; they have not thought out how many of the faiths and principles that have been the brightest lamps in the track of human advance they are extinguishing by the same unkind and freezing breath. One should take care lest in quenching the spirit of Midlothian, we leave sovereign mastery of the world to Machiavelli.|$|E
60|$|Byron {{helped to}} clear the air of this. His fire, his lofty {{spaciousness}} of outlook, his spirited interest in great national causes, his romance, and the passion both of his animosity and his sympathy, acted for a while like an electric current, and every one within his influence became ashamed to barter the large heritage of manhood, with its many realms and illimitable interests, for the sordid ease of the hearth and the good word of the unworthy. He fills men with thoughts that shake down the unlovely temple of comfort. This was good, to force whoever was not already too far sunk into the mire, high up to the larger atmosphere, whence they could see how minute an atom is man, how infinite and blind and pitiless the might that encompasses his little life. Many feeble spirits ran back homewards from the horrid solitudes and abysses of Manfred, and the moral terrors of Cain, and even the despair of Harold, and, burying themselves in warm domestic places, were comforted by the familiar restoratives and appliances. Firmer souls were not only exhilarated, but intoxicated by the potent and unaccustomed air. They went too far. They made war on the family, and the idea of it. Everything human was mischievously dwarfed, and the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> between gratification of appetite and its control for virtue's sake, between the acceptance and the evasion of clear obligation, all became invisible or of no account in the new light. That constancy and permanence, of which the family is the type, and which is the first condition alike of the stability and progress of society, was obliterated from thought. As if the wonders that have been wrought by this regulated constancy of the feeling of man for man in transforming human life were not far more transcendently exalting than the contemplation of those glories of brute nature, which are barbaric in comparison.|$|E
