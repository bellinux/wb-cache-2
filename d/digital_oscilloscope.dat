50|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the history and}} development of oscilloscope technology. The modern day <b>digital</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> grew out of multiple developments of analog oscilloscopes, which in turn {{grew out of the}} older oscillograph. The oscillograph started as a hand drawn chart which was later slightly automated. This then grew into galvanometer driven recorders and photographic recorders. Eventually, the cathode ray tube came along and displaced the oscillograph, eventually taking over the majority of the market when advancements such as triggers were added to them. With the lowering costs of digital circuitry, the <b>digital</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> has taken over the majority of the modern oscilloscope sales, with almost no makers offering analog cathode ray tube oscilloscopes. However, the oscillograph lives on to a degree in pen chart recorders for electrical signals.|$|E
5000|$|Kuriappan Alappat was an {{employee}} of Tektronix, an oscilloscope manufacturer. He and two other employees (Edward Averill and James Larsen, but for convenience the three will be referred to collectively as Alappat) devised a form of [...] "rasterizer," [...] which is a device used in a <b>digital</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> to smooth waveform data before displaying the waveform on the oscilloscope screen. (The irregularities in the waveform are called [...] "jaggies.") The invention is a system for improving the appearance of digital oscilloscopes' screen displays by connecting data points smoothly without gaps or jaggies. A <b>digital</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> ordinarily represents data points as isolated points on the screen. Each point occupies a small area on the screen termed a [...] "pixel." [...] It is convenient to connect successive data points on the screen by a line, so that the data appears on the screen as a line graph.|$|E
50|$|The 7000 series, a {{high end}} modular {{oscilloscope}} family, {{was introduced in}} the early 1970s. The series included a readout system that would display the plug in's settings on the CRT. Some conventional single-beam oscilloscope models were the 7603 ($2,700 in 1983), 7704, 7704A (250-MHz BW, $4,260), 7904 (500-MHz BW, $8,910), 7904A, and 7104 (1-GHz BW with high brightness for single shot events, $20,160). The last digit of the model number indicated the number of plug in slots the mainframe had. The 7844 ($12,665 in 1983) was a dual-beam 400-MHz BW oscilloscope. The series also included some storage scopes: 7613 (variable persistence, $5,025 in 1983), 7623, 7633 (100-MHz BW, $7,765), and 7834 (400-MHz BW, $11,705). The series also wandered into <b>digital</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> territory. The 7854 waveform processing oscilloscope ($13,750 in 1983) could function as both an analog or a <b>digital</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> with GPIB. The 7612D programmable waveform digitizer ($26,400 in 1983) and the 7912AD programmable transient waveform digitizer ($24,800) were GPIB digitizers that did not have a display.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the 1980s, <b>digital</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> became prevalent. <b>Digital</b> storage <b>oscilloscopes</b> use a fast analog-to-digital {{converter}} and memory chips to record and show a digital {{representation of a}} waveform, yielding much more flexibility for triggering, analysis, and display than is possible with a classic analog oscilloscope. Unlike its analog predecessor, the <b>digital</b> storage <b>oscilloscope</b> can show pre-trigger events, opening another dimension to the recording of rare or intermittent events and troubleshooting of electronic glitches. As of 2006 most new oscilloscopes (aside from education and a few niche markets) are digital.|$|R

5000|$|Pulse-resolved {{spectral}} {{information was}} obtained by extracting wavelengths far {{from that of the}} input pulse using a longpass filter and detecting the filtered light with a photodiode and a real-time <b>digital</b> <b>oscilloscope.</b> [...] The radiation can also be spectrally resolved with the time-stretch dispersive Fourier transform (TS-DFT), which produces a wavelength-to-time mapping such that the temporal traces collected for each event correspond to the actual spectral profile over the filtered bandwidth. The TS-DFT has subsequently been used to stretch the complete (unfiltered) output spectra of such broadband pulses, thereby allowing measurement of full pulse-resolved spectra at the megahertz repetition rate of the source (see below).|$|E
50|$|In late 2008, HAMEG {{introduced}} the first purely <b>digital</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> with TFT monitor at the electronica electronics trade fair in Munich, Germany. As all subsequently introduced instruments, these oscilloscopes include mixed-signal functions (8 or 16 digital channels) and {{the option to}} decode serial buses such as I2C, SPI, CAN and LIN. For instruments with TFT monitors, HAMEG skipped the entire generation of the classical, purely digital storage oscilloscopes (DSO) without MSO functions. By 2012, HAMEG had developed a product range of 11 MSO instruments and one analog oscilloscope. In autumn of 2012, HAMEG announced intentions to soon discontinue production of analog oscilloscopes. Allegedly, this decision was partly due to obstacles in sourcing cathode ray tubes. In February 2013, HAMEG introduced {{a new series of}} mixed-signal oscilloscopes with up to 500 MHz bandwidth.|$|E

5000|$|A {{disadvantage}} of digital oscilloscopes is the limited refresh {{rate of the}} screen. On an analog oscilloscope, the user can get an intuitive sense of the trigger rate simply {{by looking at the}} steadiness of the CRT trace. For a <b>digital</b> <b>oscilloscope,</b> the screen looks exactly the same for any signal rate which exceeds the screen's refresh rate. Additionally, it is sometimes difficult to spot [...] "glitches" [...] or other rare phenomena on the black-and-white screens of standard digital oscilloscopes; the slight persistence of CRT phosphors on analog oscilloscopes makes glitches visible even if many subsequent triggers overwrite them. Both of these difficulties have been overcome recently by [...] "digital phosphor oscilloscopes", which store data at a very high refresh rate and display it with variable intensity, to simulate the trace persistence of a CRT oscilloscope.|$|E
50|$|These images {{show the}} voltage spike and its {{elimination}} {{through the use}} of a flyback diode (1N4007). The inductor in this case is a solenoid connected to a 24V DC power supply. Each waveform was taken using a <b>digital</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> set to trigger when the voltage across the inductor dipped below zero. In Figure 1 the voltage as measured across the switch bounces/spikes to around -300 V. In Figure 2, a flyback diode was added in antiparallel with the solenoid. Instead of spiking to -300 V, the flyback diode only allows approximately -1.4 V of potential to be built up (-1.4 V is a combination of the forward bias of the 1N4007 diode (1.1 V) and the foot of wiring separating the diode and the solenoid). The waveform in Figure 2 is much less bouncy than the waveform in Figure 1. In both cases, the total time for the solenoid to discharge is a few milliseconds.|$|E
50|$|The PowerPC 603e was {{the first}} {{mainstream}} desktop processor to reach 300 MHz, as used in the Power Macintosh 6500. The 603e was also used in accelerator cards from Phase5 for the Amiga line of computers, with CPUs ranging in speeds from 160 to 240 MHz. The PowerPC 603e is still sold today by IBM and Freescale, and others like Atmel and Honeywell who makes the radiation hardened variant RHPPC. The PowerPC 603e was also {{the heart of the}} BeBox from Be Inc. The BeBox is notable since it is a multiprocessing system, something the 603 wasn't designed for. IBM also used PowerPC 603e processors in the ThinkPad 800 series laptop computers. In certain <b>digital</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> series, LeCroy used the PowerPC 603e as the main processor. The 603e processors also power all 66 satellites in the Iridium satellite phone fleet. The satellites each contain seven Motorola/Freescale PowerPC 603e processors running at roughly 200 MHz each. A custom 603e processor is also used in the Mark 54 MAKO Lightweight Torpedo.|$|E
