In {{order to}} improve the {{displacement}} output signal resolution of SMC CE 1 series digital cylinders, a four fold-frequency subdivision and direction-judgment control unit based on FPGA is designed.

40|$|Abstract: In a spark {{ignition}} engine, a variable valve lift (VVL) {{system has been}} developed for high fuel efficiency and low power loss. However, changes in valve lift cause deviations of cylinder air charge which lead to <b>individual</b> <b>cylinder</b> equivalence ratio maldistribution. In this study, {{in order to reduce}} the maldistribution, we propose <b>individual</b> <b>cylinder</b> equivalence ratio estimation and control algorithms. The estimation algorithm calculates the equivalence ratio of each cylinder by using a mathematical engine model which includes air charging, fuel film, exhaust gas, and universal exhaust gas oxygen sensor (UEGO) dynamics at various valve lifts. Based on the results of estimated equivalence ratio, the injection quantity of each cylinder is adjusted to control the <b>individual</b> <b>cylinder</b> equivalence ratio. Estimation and control performance are validated by engine experiments. Experimental results represented that the equivalence ratio maldistribution and variation are decreased by the proposed algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. : The {{effect of}} {{infantile}} nystagmus syndrome (INS) on {{the efficiency of}} goal-directed hand movements was examined. Methods. : We recruited 37 children with INS and 65 control subjects with normal vision, aged 4 to 8 years. Participants performed horizontally-oriented, goal-directed <b>cylinder</b> <b>displacements</b> as if they displaced a low-vision aid. The first 10 movements of 20 back-and-forth displacements in a trial were performed between two visually presented target areas, and the second 10 between remembered target locations (not visible). Motor performance was examined in terms of movement time, endpoint accuracy, and a harmonicity index reflecting energetic efficiency. Results. : Compared to the control group, the children with INS performed the <b>cylinder</b> <b>displacements</b> more slowly (using more time), less accurately (specifically in small-amplitude movements), and with less harmonic acceleration profiles. Their poor visual acuity proved to correlate with slower and less accurate movements, but did not correlate with harmonicity.

In both groups, movement speed and harmonicity increased with age to a similar extent. Conclusions. : Collectively, the findings suggest that, in addition to the visuospatial homing-in problems associated with the syndrome, INS is associated with inefficiency of goal-directed hand movements...|$|R

40|$|The {{overheating}} {{of certain}} cylinders of multicylinder engines is of vital import to those concerned with large power installations. Such overheating {{results in a}} loss of power from the engine. Therefore, engines must be underrated by manufacturers or else customers must install power plants which are somewhat oversized. Overheating of certain cylinders of an engine has been attributed to a nonuniform distribution of the pulsating fluid (air or fuel-air mixture) flowing through the <b>individual</b> <b>cylinders</b> of the engine. For this reason, manifolds (intake or exhaust) have been adjudged as the probable cause for overheating. To date, the majority of analytical work applicable to manifolds has been limited to intake manifolds or to steady flow conditions. The experimental work related to nonsteady flow has been limited to the total overall flow of a particular engine. The present work is concerned with the experimental procedure for measuring the pulsating flow through the <b>individual</b> <b>cylinders</b> of an internal combustion engine. Experimentation has been carried out by motoring a three cylinder, two stroke cycle, General Motors Diesel Engine.

The test engine was operated over a wide range of conditions at density altitudes of 5000 and 20, 000 feet; quantitative results are presented showing the effects of flight and engine variables upon average engine temperature and over-all temperature spread. Discussions of the effect of the variables on the shape of the temperature patterns and on the {{temperature distribution}} of <b>individual</b> <b>cylinders</b> are also included. The results indicate that, for the tests conducted, the temperature distribution patterns were chiefly determined by the fuel-air ratio and cooling-air distributions. It was possible to calculate <b>individual</b> <b>cylinder</b> temperature, on the assumption of equal power distribution among cylinders, to within an average of plus or minus 14 degrees F. of the actual temperature. A considerable change occurred in either the spread or the thrust axis, the average engine fuel-air ratio, the engine speed, the power, or the blower ratio. Smaller effects on the temperature pattern were noticed with a change in cowl-flap opening and altitude. In most of the tests, a change in conditions affected the temperature of the barrels less than that of the heads. The variation of flight and engine variables had a negligible effect on the temperature distributions of the <b>individual</b> <b>cylinders.</b> (author) ...|$|R
