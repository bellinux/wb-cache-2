500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like,</b> regardless of brand." ...|$|E

It's {{good to know that}} two ladies of soul can still be friends. We talked about doing other things together, enterprise-wise, which is cool, because she's got a good, vivid mind, that girl.

Hopefully, {{over the next few months}} I can {{convince}} Simon Grayson I'm worthy of a long-term contract." [...] On 31 December he returned to QPR after having made three league appearances, all of which were as a substitute.|$|E

500|$|... "For me, it's {{really easy}} to write {{depressive}} songs and that's why I never do that. I {{try to do}} songs that are a bit happier and a bit more complicated. I think {{there are too many}} songwriters writing sad, depressive songs, and I find it really boring, listening to music where people are just complaining. People should stop whining! I find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why I like to do it. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> to make quite hopeful, happy music {{with a little bit of}} melancholy in it, with a little spice of melancholy." ...|$|E
500|$|Doody and Kirshen {{describe}} {{the show as}} [...] "writing-heavy". Doody {{said in an interview}} with the British Comedy Guide: [...] "Compared to most radio shows, it's incredibly dense, material-wise, and very fast-moving. I think Matt and I would like some of it to be even faster, but sometimes people who've heard the pilot say things like, [...] "It's almost too much." [...] <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> that. I like that it's something you kind of need to hear twice to catch everything. When we got the series, I honestly didn't know where we'd come up with the material of the quality we were determined to keep up." ...|$|E

When we finally saw 'Triangle' after this new way of filming everything, a style that we'd never attempted before, as well as trying new scenes...trying this, trying that... that was terrific." [...] Chris Owens, who portrayed the Agent Spender Nazi lookalike, said, [...] "One thing <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> about The X-Files was that they were always challenging themselves. Chris [...] would write an episode in which we're going to do Rope without any cuts, seemingly. A great challenge for a cast and crew." ...|$|E

It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it.

500|$|The Sugababes {{performed}} [...] "No Can Do" [...] on 14 November 2008 for Children in Need. The trio {{performed the}} song later that month {{to promote the}} release of the New Xbox Experience, as part of a set list that included their singles [...] "Push the Button" [...] and [...] "About You Now". They performed [...] "No Can Do" [...] on 18 July 2009 at Ponty’s Big Weekend, which was held at Ynysangharad Park in Pontypridd, Wales, and dedicated the performance to Michael Jackson who died a month earlier.

Speaking to the official EastEnders website, she expanded on the importance of Chrissie's sense of humour and wit to her [...] "feisty" [...] characterisation: [...] "What I love about Chrissie is that she's a good strong, funny female character... she's got a really good sense of humour which is necessary to deal with Den. She's very good at wisecracks. Den has the one-liners, but Chrissie bats them right back." [...] Chrissie's barbed and biting remarks became a prominent feature of the character; even when cornered by Den's adopted daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) after attempting to flee the country, she remarks: [...] "You really are your father's daughter, Sharon.

The song was {{selective}} in its release only being sold as an album bonus track in United Kingdom and Ireland, and was dubbed [...] "Kesha edit" [...] or [...] "Dirty Picture, Pt. 2". The song {{is similar to}} the original recording of the song with the only noticeable change being that Kesha now sings the song's first verse. While being interviewed by Digital Spy Cruz explained how the cover initially came about and his view on the cover, [...] "she asked me if she could do a version of the song where she sang the first verse and I thought that was a really cool idea. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> both versions, and it's good that there are these two different versions out there, because fans of me get more of me on mine and [...] fans get more of her on hers." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore doubletracked his vocals, but {{apart from}} {{occasional}} use of delay did not use any effects on his vocals. He used an Elektron Monomachine and a Minimoog Voyager with computer software to produce the keyboard sounds on the album. Matheos detuned his guitars to C# and sometimes B instead of using a seven-string guitar because he prefers {{the sound of a}} detuned guitar: [...] "To me, they sound totally different if you have those nice loose, floppy strings," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real bitch to keep them in tune, stopping every couple measures, retuning and punching back in. Especially for [...] song that's in B, or even C# is a problem sometimes, especially if you're doing a lot of fast moving around or high up on the neck. It's a pain in the ass, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> that sound. I don't think I would ever go to a 7-string." ...|$|E
500|$|Nina was {{initially}} {{meant to be}} a [...] "bad girl", but the writers rewrote the part for Goodrem, and the character became a [...] "painfully shy schoolgirl" [...] who gets a job in the Coffee Shop. The Age described Nina as the [...] "quintessential girl next door". Goodrem described her character as [...] "a quiet, unassuming type of girl", who did not think anything of her amazing gift. When Goodrem was asked if she was similar to Nina, she replied [...] "I think I am in some ways and in some ways I'm not. Nina's very shy, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> the character Nina but I think she'd probably walk out of a room and I'd probably chat all day I think that's probably the difference, she'd sneak out of a room and I'd stay!" [...] The BBC agreed with Goodrem and said that Nina would not say [...] "boo to a goose" [...] and would flee if anyone looked her way.|$|E

But the slaps were equally well dispatched." [...] Commenting on Reid's exit, Windsor has said, [...] "We fell out when I found out he was leaving because it was a shock for me. I was really upset. I've known him 30 odd years and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> working with him. We had a great relationship as friends as well as performers. I got my own back when I had to slap him after I found out he was fooling around with Pat. I did the slap twice as I didn't think I did it hard enough the first time." ...|$|E
500|$|After touring in 1992 with drummer Chris Vrenna, the then-core of KMFDM (Konietzko, Esch, Schulz, {{and second}} guitarist Mark Durante) {{returned}} to Chicago {{and found that}} Wax Trax! had filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy to begin corporate reorganization in November 1992. The band went into the studio in 1993 as a group to record its seventh album, Angst, which sold more than 100,000 copies {{over the next two}} years. Esch said after the album's release, [...] "I like this album way more. Money was done in a hurry, and I was doing a major Pigface tour, so I didn't have much influence on the album. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> Angst. I'm totally down with it. We've tried to involve guitar players, we tried to be like a real band, especially in the creative kind of aspect." [...] After the release of Angst, Wax Trax!/TVT Records launched a promotion in which fans were encouraged to devise as many alternate meanings for KMFDM as possible, with more than a thousand submissions resulting.|$|E

It was filmed at Universal CityWalk by {{director}} Ray Kay, who had previously directed videos for Beyoncé Knowles, Lady Gaga, Alexandra Burke, and Cheryl Cole, among others. Ludacris said that the video [...] "is like a 2010 version of Michael Jackson's [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel"." [...] Bieber said that the video [...] "will capture the song's message of trying to woo back a girl." [...] In explaining the concept of the video, Bieber said, [...] "It starts off, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> this girl, but we didn't [...] along; we couldn't be together. Basically I want her back and [...] kind of going through the whole thing. I'm chasing her around, trying to get her, and she's kind of playing hard to get, but I'm persistent. I keep going." [...] The video premiered exclusively on Vevo on Friday, February 19, 2010. Singer and actress Jasmine Villegas portrays Bieber's love interest in the video. Bieber's friends, Young Money artists Drake and Lil Twist also appeared in the video, along with Tinashe and jerkin' crew The Rangers.|$|E

500|$|Miguel {{worked on}} the album for {{approximately}} three months. He sought to play a larger creative role than he had on All I Want Is You, and produced most of Kaleidoscope Dream and either wrote or co-wrote every song on the album. He recorded most of the album at Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City and MJP Studios in Los Angeles; the songs [...] "Arch & Point" [...] and [...] "Gravity" [...] were recorded at Gustavo's Golden Gloves Gymnasium in Los Angeles. He spent almost two years in New York City, which he felt let him explore [...] "the edgy side" [...] {{of his life and}} consequently made his sonical approach grittier, saying in an interview for The Village Voice, [...] "I'm not the 'go to the club and pop bottles' kind of guy. That's not my lifestyle. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> to party, but it's ... just darker. I'm looking for the speakeasy on the Lower East Side that has a secret door and a password." [...] Miguel recorded [...] "Adorn" [...] in 2011 in the bedroom of his Los Angeles apartment, which he used as a makeshift studio at the time. Parts of the album were edited by Miguel and his engineers using Pro Tools.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{process of}} the album eventually lasted from January to August 2003, with an additional mixing and mastering period lasting until October. Previous Blink-182 sessions were recorded in three months. The band stated that being in a studio longer than three months gave them the luxury of experimenting with different methods of writing, playing, and recording. The band built each song with a minute attention to detail. Hoppus described the studio as a [...] "musical laboratory": over 70 guitars, 30 amps, [...] "30 or 40" [...] different snare drums, up to six drum kits, various keyboards, turntables, and pianos {{were used in the}} album's production, a lot of which came from Finn's personal collection. Barker was responsible for the turntables and a copy of Pink Floyd's The Wall. The group also enlisted the help of James Guthrie, an engineer behind The Wall. The trio also sent The Cure frontman Robert Smith the bed track of [...] "All of This" [...] in hopes he would contribute; Smith makes a guest appearance and recorded his parts in England. The three initially believed their legitimacy would be in question due to the humor-oriented nature of their earlier recordings, to which Smith responded, [...] "Nobody knows what kind of songs you are going to write in the future and nobody knows the full potential of any band. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> the music you sent me." [...] The band also collaborated with DJ Shadow and Dan the Automator, and Barker desired to work with The Neptunes. Jerry Finn, who had produced the previous two Blink-182 albums and the Box Car Racer album, returned to produce Blink-182, which would be his final contribution with the band.|$|E
500|$|Rachel's {{cover of}} [...] "Firework" [...] by Katy Perry was {{reviewed}} negatively by Coachman. She wrote, [...] "I'm not loving Michele’s vocals on this track. It {{was like they}} wanted to purposely make her sound like Katy Perry. As much as <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> Katy Perry, Michele has more of a tremendous voice. There are parts where I thought she sounded really great, {{but for the most}} part this song just wasn't my cup of tea. Michele has such a beautiful voice; I wish she was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage." [...] Katie Morgan of Billboard gave a positive review of the Warblers' performance of [...] "Silly Love Songs", writing, [...] "Not only do they sound great , but the song brings a sugary sweet end to a super-saccharine episode." [...] The Marquee Blog at CNN gave the music numbers a positive review. A notable segment reads: [...] "I just loved seeing The Warblers get their groove on amidst the jeans and cotton T-shirts. And Kurt was super gracious trying to be supportive of Blaine, in spite of his own feelings. I also totally loved the music [...] and overall this was one of my favorite episodes this season. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair praised Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", as well as the casts' performances of [...] "P.Y.T." [...] by Michael Jackson and [...] "When I get You Alone" [...] by Robin Thicke. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave Salling's performance a positive review. She wrote, [...] "We were thoroughly entertained by Puck's attempt to win newbie Lauren Zizes over with his tribute to her larger figure. Only in Puck's world would Queen's raucous song qualify as a serenade—and our horror-turned-amusement was mirrored on his fellow New Directions' faces.
