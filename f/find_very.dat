5|$|The census {{question}} on religion has been criticised by the British Humanist Association as leading, and other surveys of religion tend to <b>find</b> <b>very</b> different results. The 2015 British Election Survey found 52% of Northerners identified as Christian (22% Anglican, 14% non-denominational Christian, 12% Roman Catholic, 2% Methodist, and 2% other Christian denominations), 40% as non-religious, 5% as Muslim, 1% as Hindu and 1% as Jewish.|$|E

Dana speculates that Nigel covered up the murder by starting the fire, and feels responsible for the sale of the slaves. To that, Kevin responds that she cannot do anything about the past, and now that Rufus is finally dead, they can return to their peaceful life together.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} the {{particles}} will, due to their higher density, not perfectly follow {{the motion of the}} fluid (gas/liquid). If experiments are done in water, for instance, it is easily possible to <b>find</b> <b>very</b> cheap particles (e.g. plastic powder with a diameter of ~60µm) with the same density as water. If the density still does not fit, the density of the fluid can be tuned by increasing/ decreasing its temperature. This leads to slight changes in the Reynolds number, so the fluid velocity or the size of the experimental object has to be changed to account for this.|$|E

[...] Hindustan Times gave it a rating of 3.5 out of 5, praising its [...] "youthful fervour" [...] and adding that [...] "the album manages to capture the essence of three different periods on which the film is premised." [...] The Times of India gave it 3 out of 5, also commenting on its fresh and youthful feel, and calling it [...] "another hit album" [...] despite the fact that [...] "it falls short in some songs".

500|$|Del Vecho {{explained}} how the film's animation team was organized: [...] "On this movie {{we do have}} character leads, supervising animators on specific characters. The animators themselves may work on multiple characters but it's always under one lead. I think it was different on Tangled, for example, but we chose {{to do it this}} way as we wanted one person to fully understand and develop their own character and then be able to impart that to the crew. Hyrum Osmond, the supervising animator on Olaf, is quiet but he has a funny, wacky personality so we knew he'd bring a lot of comedy to it; Anna's animator, Becky Bresee, it's her first time leading a character and we wanted her to lead Anna." [...] Acting coach Warner Loughlin was brought in to help the film's animators understand the characters they were creating. In order to get the general feeling of each scene, some animators did their own acting. [...] "I actually film myself acting the scene out, which I <b>find</b> <b>very</b> helpful," [...] said animation supervisor Rebecca Wilson Bresee. This helped her discover elements that made the scene feel real and believable. Elsa's supervising animator was Wayne Unten, who asked for that role because he was fascinated by the complexity of the character. Unten carefully developed Elsa's facial expressions in order to bring out her fear as contrasted against Anna's fearlessness. He also studied videos from Menzel's recording sessions and animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing. Head of Animation, Lino DiSalvo, said, [...] "The goal for the film was to animate the most believable CG characters you've ever seen." ...|$|E

The exercise was criticised as unrealistic as an actual exchange would be much larger, with one academic describing a 200-megaton attack as an [...] "extremely low figure and one which we <b>find</b> <b>very</b> difficult to take seriously", and did not include targets in Inner London such as Whitehall.

2500|$|He enjoyed {{working with}} the four young actresses in La Bande des quatre so much, that Rivette {{returned}} to the theater. The actresses had performed a scene from Pierre Corneille's Suréna in La Bande des quatre, so Rivette, the actresses and additional performers rehearsed Corneille's Tite et Bérénice, Jean Racine's Bajazet and a play by Pierre de Marivaux (which was eventually dropped [...] "because he was too hard"). After several weeks of rehearsals, the actresses were ready to perform the two plays, which ran at the Théâtre Gérard Philipe in Saint-Denis from 18 April to 20 May 1989. According to Rivette, Corneille's play was more interesting for the actresses; he was [...] "very deep. He's an author I <b>find</b> <b>very</b> dense, so full of history, of thought".|$|E

Very few people can claim they follow all the principles. For instance, telling a lie. In any religion, if you ask if telling a lie is a sin — say Christian — they will say yes. But you <b>find</b> <b>very</b> few people who don’t at some point tell a lie. Homosexuality is one act, but you can’t say [...] not a Buddhist. Or someone who tells a lie is not a Buddhist.

2500|$|Del Toro {{has said}} the film has strong {{connections}} in theme to The Devil's Backbone and {{should be seen as}} an informal sequel dealing with some of the issues raised there. Fernando Tielve and Íñigo Garcés, who played the protagonists of The Devil's Backbone, make cameo appearances as unnamed guerrilla soldiers in Pan's Labyrinth. Some of the other works he drew on for inspiration include Lewis Carroll's Alice books, Jorge Luis Borges' Ficciones, Arthur Machen's The Great God Pan and The White People, Lord Dunsany's The Blessing of Pan, Algernon Blackwood's Pan's Garden and Francisco Goya's works. In 2004, del Toro said: [...] "Pan is an original story. Some of my favourite writers (Borges, Blackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god Pan and the symbol of the labyrinth. These are things that I <b>find</b> <b>very</b> compelling and I am trying to mix them and play with them." [...] It was also influenced by the illustrations of Arthur Rackham.|$|E

2500|$|Margarite Fernandez Olmos {{comments}} on the novel's pioneering position in the Chicano literary tradition: [...] "Bless Me, Ultima blazed a path within the Chicano literary tradition in the [...] novels of identity in which the main characters must redefine themselves within the larger society {{from the vantage point}} of their own distinct ethnicity." [...] (17) Others, such as Denise Chavez (Face of an Angel,1994) support Olmos' position. In an interview with Margot Kelly, Chavez concludes, [...] "Anaya maintains that the kind of protagonist who will be able to become free is a person of synthesis, a person who is able to draw [...] [...] [...]on our Spanish roots and our native indigenous roots and become a new person, become that Mestizo with a unique perspective." [...] In general, Amy Barrias' analyses of representative coming-of-age Chicano and American Indian texts, including Bless Me, Ultima allows her to conclude that because American Indian and Chicano(a) writers <b>find</b> <b>very</b> little in dominant culture on which to build an identity, they have turned inward to create their own texts of rediscovery.
