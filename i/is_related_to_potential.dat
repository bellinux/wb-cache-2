The study says, “Comparisons between 25- and 70-year-olds showed declines of 1,000 to 1,200 kcal/day for men and 600 to 800 kcal/day for women”. [...] Reasons for this decline include physiological changes, a switch in the sensation of thirst and hunger, chronic diseases, a decline in physical functioning, limited resources and social factors, namely widowhood. Healthy older persons’ low intakes of protein, carbohydrate, fat, and total energy were found to be strong predictors of mortality.

However, when large renal cysts are associated with flank or back pain, hypertension or renal calyceal or pelvic obstruction, they require treatment (Brown et al. 1995). Symptomatic renal cysts can be treated {{by a variety of}} surgical and interventional managements such as percutaneous aspiration with or without sclerotherapy (Amar and Das 1984; Agarwal et al. 2012; Zerem et al. 2008; el-Diasty et al. 1995). Surgical treatment and laparoscopic deroofing are more invasive, and thus necessitate general anesthesia with the accompanying potential operative morbidity and possible complications. Compared to other surgical treatment methods, percutaneous needle aspiration and sclerotherapy are less invasive (Agarwal et al. 2012). Although various sclerosants have been used, alcohol is the most commonly used sclerosing material for cyst ablation (Amar and Das 1984; Mohsen and Gomha 2005; Kwon et al. 2007; Choi et al. 2009; Egilmez et al. 2007).

Descriptive analysis of total sales data from the Danish Register of Medicinal Product Statistics, to individuals in the primary healthcare sector, of all BZD and Z drugs {{in the period of}} 2003 – 2013. Prescription data derive from all community and hospital pharmacies in Denmark. The prescribing of long-acting BZD was reduced from 25. 8 defined daily doses (DDD) / 1000 inhabitants/day in 2003 to 8. 8 DDD/ 1000 inhabitants/day in 2013, a relative reduction of 66 %. The prescrib-ing of short-acting BZD was reduced from 26. 1 DDD/ 1000 inhabitants/day in 2003 to 16. 4 DDD/ 1000 inhabitants/day in 2013, a relative reduction of 37 %. Prescription data in this study did not include information about indications for initiating treatments. In addition, due to compliance problems, some of the prescribed drugs may not have been consumed according to the prescrip-tion.

Distance from the gate and a special type of animation of the fill pattern is used to provide an assessment of gate, vent and overflow locations. Techniques {{have been developed to}} convert part design information in the form of STL files to a volume-based representation called a voxel model. The use of STL files makes the process CAD system independent. Once in voxel form, methods that were developed in this work are used to identify thick regions in the part, thin regions in the part and/or die, distance from user specified entry locations (gates), and the qualitative depiction of the fill pattern.

40|$|PurposeStatins have {{demonstrated}} their efficacy {{in many situations}} to prevent cardiovascular risk. In this work we investigated the link between chronic use of statins, type of subsequent acute coronary syndrome (ACS), namely ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or unstable angina/non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI), early complications {{and their impact on}} one-year mortality in real life conditions. MethodsOur study was based on 2006 data from the French MONICA population-based registry which collects all cases of ACS occurring in people aged 35 - 74 in 3 French areas. The sample consisted of 1951 hospitalized incident ACS (72 were excluded because of missing data). Relationship between chronic use of statins and type of ACS or early complications (resuscitated cardiac arrests and shocks) were analyzed through logistic regression. Impact on one-year mortality was evaluated through Cox models. Analyses were adjusted for patients’ characteristics (living area, age, gender and previous cardiovascular treatments). ResultsBefore index event, the rate of statins treated patients was 18 %. The percentage of UA/NSTEMI among all hospitalized ACS was 45 %; 54. 5 % in patients with previous statins treatment and 42. 9 % in those without (p< 0. 0001). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for UA/NSTEMI was 1. 29 (p= 0. 049) for subjects with versus those without statins. There was a significant association between statins and early complications (adjusted OR 0. 58; p= 0. 030). Statins treatment prior to event was associated with a significant decrease in one-year mortality with an adjusted HR equal to 0. 62 (p= 0. 017). ConclusionsIn our registry, people already treated with statins before an incident ACS had a lower rate of one-year mortality. This may result from a lower probability to develop STEMI, or early complications. However it remains difficult to assess from these observational data what is related to the treatment and what <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>potential</b> confounding bias...|$|E
40|$|Human milk {{as well as}} {{the milk}} of several {{mammalian}} species contains, beside major nutrients and anti-infectious and immunocompetent substances, a group of biologically active substances called "milk-borne trophic factors" or "growth modulators". Milk-borne trophic can be classified into three groups: hormones and trophic peptides; nucleotides, nucleosides and derived substances; and polyamines, especially spermine and spermidine. Certain hormones and peptides such as growth hormone, insulin, insulin like-growth factor I (IGF-I), epidermal growth factor (EGF), prolactin and growth hormone releasing factor (GHRF) can influence directly newborn's metabolism after intestinal absorption and promote growth and differentiation of several organs and target tissues. They could exert a cytoprotective effect against toxins and toxic substances and reduce the potential risk of necrotizing enterocolitis. Nucleotides are present in human milk at high levels, and are precursors of nucleic acids, which implies that they can enhance growth and differentiation of several organs and tissues, especially the liver. Nucleotides from milk enhance lipid metabolism, lipoprotein synthesis and liver cell function and regeneration. In addition, they have a determinant action {{on the development of the}} gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Lastly, polyamines, mainly spermine and spermidine, are polycationic substances virtually present in all cells, whose concentration in human milk is about ten times higher than in infant formulae. In addition, spermine and spermidine levels increase markedly during the first 3 days of lactation reaching, after 1 week, plateau levels which are respectively 12 and eight times higher than the levels measured at day 0. Although several experimental studies have shown that polyamines from the milk of lactating mammals determine important mitogenic, metabolic and immunological effects promoting growth and differentiation of the immature gastrointestinal tract of the offspring, their beneficial effects on growth and differentiation of the gastrointestinal tract in humans remain hypothetical. As a consequence, enrichment of milk formulae in one or in several trophic factors is an important but complex goal. Its practical realization is not realistic today because of a too great number of incertitudes. The most important <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>potential</b> beneficial or adverse effects emerging at short or at long term and to the individual interactions of these substances which could be agonist and antagonist because they are naturally present in milk as a "complex cocktail" whose composition changes during the lactation period...|$|E

40|$|Glycolic acid was {{effective}} at dissolving many metals, including iron, during processing with simulants. Criticality constraints {{take credit for}} the insolubility of iron during processing to prevent criticality of fissile materials. Testing with actual waste was needed {{to determine the extent}} of iron and fissile isotope dissolution during Chemical Process Cell (CPC) processing. The Alternate Reductant Project was initiated by the Savannah River Remediation (SRR) Company to explore options for the replacement of the nitric-formic flowsheet used for the CPC at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). The goals of the Alternate Reductant Project are to reduce CPC cycle time, increase mass throughput of the facility, and reduce operational hazards. In order to achieve these goals, several different reductants were considered during initial evaluations conducted by Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). After review of the reductants by SRR, SRNL, and Energy Solutions (ES) Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL), two flowsheets were further developed in parallel. The two flowsheet options included a nitric-formic-glycolic flowsheet, and a nitric-formic-sugar flowsheet. As of July 2011, SRNL and ES/VSL have completed the initial flowsheet development work for the nitric-formic-glycolic flowsheet and nitric-formic-sugar flowsheet, respectively. On July 12 th and July 13 th, SRR conducted a Systems Engineering Evaluation (SEE) to down select the alternate reductant flowsheet. The SEE team selected the Formic-Glycolic Flowsheet for further development. Two risks were identified in SEE for expedited research. The first risk is related to iron and plutonium solubility during the CPC process with respect to criticality. Currently, DWPF credits iron as a poison for the fissile components of the sludge. Due to the high iron solubility observed during the flowsheet demonstrations with simulants, it was necessary to determine if the plutonium in the radioactive sludge slurry demonstrated the same behavior. The second risk <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>potential</b> downstream impacts of glycolate on Tank Farm processes. The downstream impacts will be evaluated by a separate research team. Waste Solidification Engineering (WSE) has requested a radioactive demonstration of the Glycolic-Formic Flowsheet with radioactive sludge slurry be completed in the Shielded Cells Facility of the SRNL. The Shielded Cells demonstration only included a Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) cycle, and not a Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) cycle or the co-processing of salt products. Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5) slurry was used for the demonstration since it was readily available, had been previously characterized, and was generally representative of sludges being processing in DWPF.

40|$|Business process {{re-engineering}} (part of the Business Process Management domain) {{is among}} the top three concerns of Information Technology (IT) leaders and is deemed {{to be one of}} many important IT leveraging opportunities. Two major challenges have been identified in relation to BPM and the use of IT. The first challenge is related to involving business process participants in process improvement initiatives using BPM systems. BPM technologies are considered to be primarily targeted for developers and not BPM users, and the need to engage process participants into process improvement initiatives is not addressed, contributing to the business-IT gap. The second challenge <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>potential</b> de-skilling of knowledge workers when knowledge-intensive processes are automated and process knowledge resides in IT, rather than human process participants. The two identified challenges are not separate issues. Process participants need to be knowledgeable about the process in order to actively contribute to BPM initiatives, and the loss of process knowledge as a result of passive use of automated systems may further threaten their participation in process improvement. In response to the call for more research on the individual impacts of business process initiatives, the purpose of this dissertation study is to understand the relationship between IT configurations (particularly process support and process visualization), process characteristics and individual level process outcomes, such as task performance and process knowledge. In the development of the research model we rely on organizational knowledge creation literature and scaffolding in Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development, business process modeling and workflow automation research, as well as research on the influence of IT on individual performance. The theoretical model is tested empirically in experimental settings using a series of two studies. In both studies participants were asked to complete tasks as part of a business process using different versions of a mock-up information system. Together, the studies evaluate the effect of IT process support, process visualization and process complexity on process participant performance and process knowledge. The results of the studies show the significant influence of IT process support on individual process outcomes. The studies indicate that task performance does increase but at the cost of users’ process knowledge. Process visualization however is shown to enhance user’s process knowledge in the event of no formal process training while having no negative impact on task performance. The key contribution of this research is that it suggests a practical way to counteract potential negative effects of IT process automation by converting the use of the information system into a learning experience, where the IT itself acts as a scaffold for the acquisition of process knowledge. The results have practical implications for the design of workflow automation systems, as well as for process training...|$|E
40|$|Inter{{national}} audienceIFB, the French Elixir Node, is {{a national}} service infrastructure which provides services and resources in bioinformatics[1]. IFB’s goal is to offer to scientific users and developers a scalable, flexible and user-friendly computation facility associated to a large storage capacity, as needed for current life science data processing. To analyze heterogeneous biological data, bioinformaticians require hundreds of different specialized software including well-established tools as well as research prototypes. In addition, these software are used alone or in workflows, from GUI or command lines, for production, tests or developments. Thus, providing an updated and complete set of tools requires huge resources. To offer an efficient service for this expected diversity of usages, we propose a software architecture and a cloud model which bring solutions for tools packaging, rapid deployment and multiple channel software distribution. We describe here the set of technical components that we built to enable a Container as a Service Model (CaaS) adapted to a bioinformatics academic cloud facility. BioShaDock BioShaDock[2] is the community based container registry for bioinformatics of the French bioinformatics Institute. It focuses on reproducibility in bioinformatics tools or pipelines using Docker containers. Containers are automatically build in background with security scans and meta data extraction. Meta-data can include general information but also ontologies terms. The BioShaDock registry already provides a large catalog of tools direcly from users, or project like Bioconda or Debian. The registry is open source {{and can be used}} by anyone, it is accessible by any Docker or rkt client. Computer scientists and bioinformaticians can more easily disseminate their programs and find potential users using a dedicated domain-centric Docker registry. There is a wide range of possible uses for container registries in bioinformatics: repositories managed at a community level, based on tools embedded in containers, allow users to exchange and replicate data analyses. GO-Docker GO-Docker[3] is a batch computing/cluster management tool using Docker as an execution/isolation system. It is dedicated to containers and has both a command line client and a web front end. It uses Docker Swarm and Apache Mesos and is compatible with google Kubernetes. A common concern regarding containers solution for cloud or HPC <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>potential</b> security issues. First of all, we should remind that Docker implements the Linux Kernel cgroups feature and {{it can be used to}} isolate resource usage by users. Furthermore, we implemented SSL certificate and LDAP authentication in the GO-Docker Rest API prior to allow access to the job scheduler that manage the nodes where containers can be run. In addition, depending on the facility audience and exposure, an even safer solution can be obtained by using virtualized computation nodes. Developers used to command line can exploit the Go-Docker CLI that emulates classical scheduler commands. GO-Docker has a rich Rest API used in by clients. The clients (PYTHON or JAVA) can be used in script or SaaS front end. Galaxy to Docker Galaxy is a widely adopted user-friendly web front-end for biological data processing. It provides powerful functionalities to enhance data analysis accessibility and reproducibility. It currently suits well the integration of existing command line tools and offers a large collection of bioinformatics software. However, the integration of each software needs the manual off-line creation of XML descriptor and sometimes additional wrappers: it is still a technical and time-consuming task. We propose to by-pass this limitation by enabling the direct execution of command line within any Ad Hoc container from a trusted repository like BioShaDock using the GO-Docker python API. This Galaxy to Docker component allows to create and use new “on demand tools” in a Galaxy instance without being an administrator and without need for coding. Accordingly, advanced users can easily and quickly include custom developments in their data analysis pipelines. This results in a more flexible Galaxy environment. D 4 WP The D 4 workflow portal (D 4 WP) [4] is an advanced SaaS developer oriented environment for rapid tool and workflow design. It allows online graphical workflow and component authoring. Any command line tool and script are quickly captured and integrated using a full WYSIWYG approach. All workflow component dependencies can be defined as containers using an URI syntax. In this way a re-executable and self-contained workflow specification can be produced. D 4 WP integrates a GO-Docker scheduler API. From a unique specification, code generation can be used to target different languages to maximize potential workflow usage and dissemination. Current developments focus on Galaxy tool generation and Common Workflow Language export. The presented software components allow the creation of reproducible and flexible data analysis environments for different audiences (end users and developers) and multiple purposes (production data analysis, benchmark, workflow, tool and method development, dissemination, article publishing…) All tools embedded in containers, made available in BioShaDock and scheduled with GO-Docker are directly usable in Galaxy, D 4 WP and command line. We think that such an architecture limits deployment overhead and software integration cost and therefore accelerates the transfer of bioinformatics research output to production computation facilities. In a context of massive biological data production, the CaaS model offer interesting prospects. Thus, when data movement is limited by network capacity, deploying the whole CaaS environment on data production nodes may be a pragmatic solution. Furthermore, the suite of software components we presented here are developed to fit the long-term objective of the creation of a federation of interoperable clouds. Future works will include dissemination related features and compatibility and standardization effort. References 1. IFB cloud: The academic cloud of the French Institute of Bioinformatics.

This knowledge is even becoming mandatory for most unconventional plays. The local stress field directly affects, for instance, wellbore stability, the orientation of hydraulically induced fractures, and – especially in fractured reservoirs – permeability anisotropies. Robust information on the locally prevailing stresses is thus ideally required prior to drilling. Numerical models based on the finite element (FE) method are {{able to cope with}} the complexity of real reservoirs. Acting as predictive tools, these models not only provide quantitative information on the stress distribution, but also a process-based understanding of geomechanical reservoir behavior. This study evaluates the potential of geomechanical FE models for the prediction of local in situ stress distribution and fracture networks in faulted reservoirs. The work of this study was conducted in cooperation with three major operators in the E&P industry and comprises two main parts. In the first methodological part, a generally applicable workflow is developed for building geomechanical FE models and calibrating them to field data. These models focus on spatial variations of in situ stress resulting from faults and contrasts in mechanical rock properties. Special techniques are elaborated regarding the transfer of the reservoir geometry from geological subsurface models to the numerical model and for the most effective application of boundary conditions. Complex fault geometries and the detailed topology of lithostratigraphic horizons can be considered on reservoir scale. In combination with reservoir-specific material parameters the incorporated horizons establish a mechanical stratigraphy inside the model. Faults are implemented as discrete planes by 2 D interface elements. This allows fault-specific stresses and corresponding fault behavior to be analyzed. The resulting geomechanical models comprise high spatial resolution and several million elements. They are calculated in time spans of less than 20 hours by using high-performance computing. In addition, submodels resolving a detailed mechanical stratigraphy can be integrated into the reservoir-wide modeling for local focus. In {{the second part of the}} study, the workflow was successfully applied to an intensively faulted gas reservoir in the North German Basin. Comprehensive datasets are provided by the field operators and project partners for building and calibrating a detailed and truly field-scale geomechanical model covering more than 400 km². It incorporates a network of 86 faults and a mechanical stratigraphy of three layers comprising reservoir-specific material parameters. For the static modeling approach, the present-day regional stress field is applied as boundary condition. Static modeling results are compared to local stress measurements, e. g. orientations from borehole breakouts and magnitudes from frac data. After iterative calibration, the best-fit model reveals the recent in situ stress distribution and individual fault behavior throughout the reservoir. The results show significant local perturbations of stress magnitudes (max. ± 10 MPa over 1 - 2 km distance) and only minor deviations in stress orientation from the regional trend (max. ± 25 °). The strong dependency on the specific fault trace, offset and interactions precludes the derivation of generally valid rules for estimating stress variations and underlines the necessity of numerical modeling. Analysis of fault-specific results indicates that critical stress states occur most likely on NW-SE trending faults in the present-day stress field. Fracture information is inferred from a (geo-) dynamic model focusing on the major stages in the tectonic history of the reservoir and the respective past in situ stresses. Consequently, paleo-stress fields are applied as boundary condition and material parameters are adjusted. Correlation of fracture orientations and modeled paleo-stresses in the reservoir allows the formation of fracture sets to be assigned to Triassic and Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous times. Increased perturbation intensity in the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>potential</b> reactivation of NW-SE trending faults and explains the variability of the corresponding fracture set. These results elucidate how stress perturbations can explain fracture variability without the need for complex tectonic histories. Furthermore, the dynamic model sheds light on fault zone permeability. Modeling indicates that if cataclasis is responsible for a reduced fault permeability, then it will most likely occur along E-W and NNE-SSW trending faults due to the high slip tendency values they experienced in the tectonic past. Modeling results show no such increased geomechanical exposure for NW-SE oriented faults. However, high dilation tendencies support the possibility of activity of these faults in Late Jurassic times – as proposed by fracture correlation. Low permeability of NW-SE trending faults is thus most likely the result of fluid entry and illitization, which is also observed at a wellbore close to such a fault set. The combination of static and dynamic modeling results suggests no significant impact of critically stressed natural fractures on the recent hydraulic behavior of the entire reservoir. Additionally tests of fault block refinements and submodels demonstrate their capability to provide further increased spatial resolution in areas of particular interest. The submodel generated for the northwestern part of the case study underlines the impact of the specific connections of the fault network on the modeling results. The outcome of this study confirms the high potential of geomechanical FE models to reveal the specific in situ stress and fault behavior, and to infer fracture characteristics from paleo-stresses. Beside the case study specific insights, the successfully applied and approved workflow can be used for future modeling of stress-sensitive reservoirs. Furthermore, the geomechanical models are not limited in application to the hydrocarbon industry. As general tools for stress prediction in undrilled rock formations, they can also be applied to deep geothermal reservoirs and underground engineering, for instance. The possibility of characterizing fault behavior makes the models additionally valuable in the fields of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear waste disposal...|$|E
