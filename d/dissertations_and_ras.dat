40|$|Radium {{diffusion}} from sediments to overlying {{water is}} one of the important sources of radium isotopes in ocean water. A series of laboratory desorption/diffusion experiments were conducted to help elucidate the characteristics of sediments on 224 <b>Ra</b> <b>and</b> 226 <b>Ra</b> desorption <b>and</b> diffusion, which included 1) 224 <b>Ra</b> <b>and</b> 226 <b>Ra</b> desorption from sediments in water of different salinities, 2) 224 <b>Ra</b> <b>and</b> 226 <b>Ra</b> desorption from sediments of different grain sizes in water of the same salinity, 3) 224 <b>Ra</b> <b>and</b> 226 <b>Ra</b> diffusive fluxes by observing Ra enrichment with time in the overlying water of incubated sediments. The experimental results show that there is an increase in the amount of 224 <b>Ra</b> <b>and</b> 226 <b>Ra</b> with the increase of salinity from 5 to 30, <b>and</b> <b>Ra</b> desorption is strongest at the salinity of 25. Under the same salt water condition, 224 <b>Ra</b> <b>and</b> 226 <b>Ra</b> desorption activities of the four grain sizes (2000 ~ 1000 μm, 1000 ~ 500 μm, 500 ~ 250 μm and 250 ~ 125 μm) of sediments are very close to each other. When the grain sizes of sediments are larger than 2000 μm, the 224 <b>Ra</b> <b>and</b> 226 <b>Ra</b> desorption activities are slightly higher than those of the sediments of the above-mentioned four grain sizes. When the grain sizes of sediments are less than 125 μm, the 224 <b>Ra</b> <b>and</b> 226 <b>Ra</b> desorption activities are much larger than those of the above-mentioned five grain sizes. The average diffusive fluxes of 224 <b>Ra</b> <b>and</b> 226 <b>Ra</b> of sediments from Jiaozhou Bay are 0. 85 Bq·m- 2 ·d- 1 and 0. 022 Bq·m- 2 ·d- 1, respectively...|$|R

40|$|An HPLC-peroxyoxalate {{chemiluminescence}} (PO-CL) {{method for}} simultaneous determination of methylphenidate (MPH) <b>and</b> ritalinic acid (<b>RA)</b> was developed. The method {{was used to}} monitor MPH <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> after administration of MPH to rats. Deproteinized plasma spiked with 1 -(3 -trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine (IS) was dried and labeled with 4 -(N,N-dimethylaminosulfonyl) - 7 -fluoro- 2, 1, 3 -benzoxadiazole (DBD-F). The labeled sample was cleaned with two kinds of solid-phase extraction cartridge, and the DBD-labels were separated on an ODS column with gradient elution using a mixture of CH(3) CN and imidazole-HNO(3) buffer. Separation of MPH <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> can be achieved within 33  min. The LODs of MPH <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> {{at a signal-to-noise ratio}} of 3 were 2. 2 and 0. 4  ng mL(- 1), respectively. Moreover, monitoring of MPH <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> after MPH administration (10  mg kg(- 1)) to rat could be performed. The concentration of RA 480  min after administration was eight times higher than that of MPH. The proposed HPLC-PO-CL method was useful for determination of MPH <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> in rat plasma and was successfully used to monitor these substances after MPH administration...|$|R
40|$|The radical {{scavenging}} {{activity and}} inhibition effect from lipid peroxidation induced by peroxyl radical of meth-anol extract from Perilla frutescens and its active compound, rosmarinic acid (RA), were investigated in vitro. The treatment of extract <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> scavenged 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl, hydroxyl radical (·OH) and nitric oxide in a concentration-dependent manner. In particular, the extract <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> showed strong radical scavenging activity against ·OH, the most toxic and reactive radical. In addition, Perilla frutescens <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> effectively inhibited lipid oxidation induced by sodium nitroprusside and 2, 2 '-azobis(2 -aminopropane) dihydrochloride, {{determined by the}} ferric thiocyanate method. The present results suggest that Perilla frutescens <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> play a protective role against oxidative stress induced by free radical and lipid peroxidation...|$|R

30|$|Simultaneously, we used AFM {{to compare}} the cell {{membrane}} particle size <b>and</b> <b>Ra</b> of the membrane surface before or after glucose stimulation of IPCs and beta cells. Our results revealed that both membrane particle size <b>and</b> <b>Ra</b> of beta cells were larger than those of IPCs. When both two groups of endocrine cells were stimulated by glucose, the membrane particle size <b>and</b> <b>Ra</b> were higher than those not stimulated, except for IPCs that were stimulated for 30 min with low glucose concentration. The magnitude of cellular Ra, {{as well as the}} types, structure, and quantity of membrane protein molecules, directly influenced the inclines and declines of the membrane surface [23]. We speculated that the reason for the lower membrane particle size <b>and</b> <b>Ra</b> in IPCs might be due to their lower membrane protein content. The cell membrane accomplishes its biological function through membrane liquidity, and exocytosis is one of the functions that depend on membrane liquidity [24, 25]. IPCs and beta cells secreted insulin through exocytosis. In the meantime, their plasma membranes were replenished via membrane liquidity. We inferred that the change in membrane liquidity might cause the increase in cell membrane particle size <b>and</b> <b>Ra</b> after glucose stimulation.|$|R
40|$|Objective. Current {{studies of}} serum sclerostin levels in AS <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> {{patients}} are inconsistent. This meta-analysis {{was performed to}} identify the association of serum sclerostin level with AS <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> patients. Methods. Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases (up to 25 January 2017) were used to collect all relevant published articles. Studies were pooled and standard mean difference (SMD) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was calculated. All data analyses were performed using RevMan 5. 3. Results. Totally eight studies of AS including 420 AS patients and 317 healthy controls (HC) and three studies of RA including 145 [*]RA patients and 127 [*]HC were finally included in this meta-analysis. The results revealed that the serum sclerostin levels in both AS patients (SMD=- 0. 14; 95 % CI=[- 0. 39, 0. 11]; P= 0. 28) <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> patients (SMD=- 0. 10; 95 % CI=[- 0. 34, 0. 15]; P= 0. 43) {{were not significantly different}} from those in HC.

The difference of serum sclerostin levels in AS <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> patients was not significantly different from HC, indicating that the sclerostin may not associate with the development of AS <b>and</b> <b>RA...</b>|$|R

Simultaneous imaging analysis reveals that in the absence of extracellular stimuli, autonomous PI 3 K <b>and</b> <b>Ras</b> activation occur, concurrently, at the same sites where F-actin projection emerges. The loss of PI 3 K binding to Ras–guanosine triphosphate abolishes this PI 3 K activation, whereas prevention of PI 3 K activity suppresses autonomous Ras activation, suggesting that PI 3 K <b>and</b> <b>Ras</b> form a positive feedback circuit. This circuit is associated with both random cell migration and cytokinesis and may have initially evolved to control stochastic changes in the cytoskeleton...|$|R
40|$|Feeding {{habits of}} the Molina's hog-nosed skunk, Conepatus chinga (Molina, 1782) in the extreme south of Brazil. We {{analyzed}} 60 stomachs of road-kills of C. chinga in the extreme south of Brazil. The contents revealed 808 prey parts, including invertebrates (frequency of occurrence - FO = 96. 7 % and relative abundance - RA = 94. 7 %), vertebrates (FO = 18. 3 % <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> = 2. 8 %) and plants (FO = 31. 7 % <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> = 2. 3 %). We identified 18 kinds of food, including the invertebrate order Coleoptera which showed the highest FO (86. 7 %) <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> (75. 2 %). Other important orders were Orthoptera (FO = 35 % <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> = 10. 4 %) and Araneae (FO = 41. 7 % <b>and</b> <b>RA</b> = 4 %). The combination of occurrence and abundance of the preys consumed allowed classifying C. chinga as an omnivorous with a predominance of insects, especially Coleoptera, consuming other invertebrates, vertebrates and plants in smaller numbers. Behavioral and morphological adaptations of C. chinga favor the predation of insects, which are preys that offer low physical resistance and are available in all terrestrial environments...|$|R
