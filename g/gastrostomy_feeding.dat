5|$|Infants and {{patients}} fed via a gastrostomy tube {{can also be}} given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. <b>Gastrostomy</b> <b>feeding</b> avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding.

40|$|Background: Malnutrition {{remains a}} common problem in cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) patients, despite pancreatic enzymes and hypercaloric diet advice. When oral supplementation fails, additional overnight gastrostomy tube-feeding is a therapeutic option. Methods : In our centre <b>gastrostomy</b> tube <b>feeding</b> is proposed when weight for height drops below 85 % despite intensive dietetic counselling. All the CF patients at our centre (n = 11) receiving <b>gastrostomy</b> tube <b>feeding</b> were evaluated for changes in nutritional status and pulmonary function. Complications of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy were inventarised and patients older than 7 years and all the parents were asked to fill in a questionnaire concerning subjective well-being with <b>gastrostomy</b> supplemental <b>feeding.</b> Results : The patients received 40 % of the recommended daily allowances (RDA) for energy by tube feeding. Total daily energy intake increased by 30 %. Within 3 months {{this resulted in a}} significant improvement in nutritional status expressed as percentage of ideal weight for height or body mass index z-score. After 6 months a significant catch-up growth was detectable. Pulmonary function remained stable. The complications were local irritation (n = 4), night sweating (n = 1) and bed-wetting (n = 1). The gastrostomy was well accepted. Conclusion : Gastrostomy appears to be a good and safe way to improve nutritional status, growth and mood of the CF child. As decreased pulmonary function plays {{a crucial role in the}} growth of the CF child, full normalisation of growth pattern is not achieved despite catch-up. <b>Gastrostomy</b> tube <b>feeding</b> should perhaps be used earlier to optimalise growth...|$|R

50|$|Persons with {{dementia}} {{may have difficulty}} eating. Whenever it is available as an option, the recommended response to eating problems is having a caretaker do assisted feeding for the person. A secondary option for people who cannot swallow effectively is to consider <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>feeding</b> tube placement {{as a way to}} give nutrition. However, in bringing person comfort and keeping functional status while lowering risk of aspiration pneumonia and death, assistance with oral feeding is at least as good as tube feeding. Tube-feeding is associated with agitation, increased use of physical and chemical restraints, and worsening pressure ulcers.

40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{differential}} {{diagnoses of}} acute abdomen in children include common and rare pathologies. Within this list, {{different types of}} bezoars causing gastrointestinal obstruction {{have been reported in}} the literature and different methods of management have been described. The aim of this article is to highlight a rare presentation of lactobezoars following prolonged percutaneous endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>feeding</b> and its successful surgical management. Case presentation A 16 -year-old boy was admitted to a paediatric ward with abdominal distension and high output from his permanent <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>feeding</b> tube, with drainage of bilious fluids. The clinical, radiological and endoscopical examinations were suggestive of partial duodenal obstruction with multiple bezoars in the stomach and duodenum. Gastrojejunostomy was performed after the removal of 14 bezoars. The child had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on the sixth postoperative day in a stable condition.

50|$|The {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in infants with Robin sequence focus upon breathing and feeding, and optimizing growth and nutrition despite the predisposition for breathing difficulties. If {{there is evidence}} of airway obstruction (snorty breathing, apnea, difficulty taking a breath, or drops in oxygen), then the infant should be placed in the sidelying or prone position, which helps bring the tongue base forward in many children. One study of 60 infants with PRS found that 63% of infants responded to prone positioning (Smith and Senders, 2006, Int J Pediatr Oto). 53% of the infants in this study required some form of feeding assistance, either nasogastric tube or <b>gastrostomy</b> tube feedings (<b>feeding</b> directly into the stomach). In a separate study of 115 children with the clinical diagnosis of PRS managed at 2 different hospitals in Boston (Evans et al., 2006, In J Pediatr Oto), respiratory distress was managed successfully in 56% without an operation (either by prone positioning, short term intubation, or placement of a nasopharyngeal airway).

40|$|Many {{infants with}} a {{repaired}} esophageal atresia (EA) undergo fundoplication, aortopexy or glossopexy because the mechanisms {{most responsible for}} airway obstruction and/or apparent life-threatening event (AO/ALTE) syndrome {{are considered to be}} gastroesophageal reflux (GER), tracheal compression (TC), or obstructive apnea, respectively. In the present study, we investigated whether these mechanisms are independent or interrelated. We developed a database of 120 consecutive patients with EA treated by the senior author between 1967 - 2002. We studied the clinical manifestations of patients with a cervical esophagostomy and/or blind lower esophageal stump, which ruled out TC and/or proximal esophageal GER as a mechanism for AO/ALTE. Of 25 neonates who underwent section/ligation of lower tracheo-esophageal fistula and/or <b>feeding</b> <b>gastrostomy,</b> 10 critically ill neonates died. Of 15 survivors, 9 infants had a <b>feeding</b> <b>gastrostomy</b> without an esophagostomy. Of these, 6 infants presented one or more episodes of AO, and 8 presented ALTE with or without AO.
