60|$|Sometimes Edmund made {{excursions}} in the fens, where with {{nets and}} snares {{he caught the}} fish which swarmed in the sluggish waters; or, having covered his boat with a leafy bower until it resembled a <b>floating</b> <b>bush,</b> drifted close to the flocks of wild-fowl, and with his bow and arrows obtained many a plump wild duck. Smaller birds were caught in snares or traps, or with bird-lime smeared on twigs. Eldred seldom joined his son in his hunting excursions, as he was busied with his brother the abbot in concerting the measures of defence and in organizing a band of messengers, who, on the first warning of danger, could be despatched throughout the fens to call in the fisher population to the defence of the abbey.|$|R

50|$|According to Ndi Ichie Akwa Mythology and Folklore Origins of the Igbos, Ikenga {{was the son}} of Ngwu, and was a bold warrior and fantastic wrestler. He was reputed {{with the}} ability of flying from one Iroko tree to another. He was the first living man in living memory to earn the title Ogba-aka ari Oji which meant a climber of iroko tree without the aid of strings. Ikenga lead the Nkwo nation in the first and famous river of sea battle ever {{undertaken}} by any nation in the Oji country. Mermaids came to fight for the Edo people and many Ododo warriors rode on the backs of mammoth sharks and crocodiles. Edo herbalists had the power to conjure large stones to fly and ram on the buildings of the Nkwo nations to destruction. The war was intense and lasted one month. For the first time, the use of green foliage camouflage was introduced by Ikenga and his warriors so that they appeared as <b>floating</b> <b>bushes</b> on the seas, until they came close enough on their targets to rout the Edo and Ododo enemies.|$|R
40|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>bush</b> journal {{bearings}} {{are widely used}} to support small-sized high speed rotating machinery. The bearing shows the following peculiar phenomena when the supplied pressure is low. That is, the bush-to journal speed ratio decreases and {{the disappearance of the}} oil whip may be observed as the journal rotational speed increases These could be explained qualitatively when the model with the axial oil film rupture being considered is applied to the inner oil film of the bearing. However, the predictions are in quantitatively poor agreement with the measurements. This paper aims at predicting the bush driving torque of the inner oil film by utilizing the cubic interpolated pseudoparticle (CIP) method that has been developed in the numerical analysis of the multi-phase flow. It is found that the predicted torque is much smaller than the torque obtained from the previous model when the journal speed is high. This results from the incursion of the air into the film from the bearing side end. The effect of some design variables such as the surface tension, which cannot be incorporated in the previous model, on the torque is also shown...|$|R
40|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>bush</b> journal {{bearings}} {{are widely used}} to support small-sized high-speed rotating machinery. When　the supplied pressure is low, the bearing shows peculiar phenomena. As the shaft rotational speed increases, the bush rotational speed levels off and {{the disappearance of the}} oil whip is observed. They can be explained qualitatively by applying the hydrodynamic lubrication model with the axial oil film rupture being considered. However, the predictions are in quantitatively poor agreement with the measurements. This experimental report shows the effect of the circumferential oil groove and holes into the inner oil film and the slope of the bush inner side end, which are not considered in the theoretical model, on the bush rotational speed and the high-speed stability. It is found that the bush rotational speed levels off at a lower shaft rotational speed, resulting in the lower bush speed, and that the oil whip disappears at a lower shaft speed, when the supplied pressure is lower. The groove, the driving torque of which cannot be negligible, lowers the bush rotational speed and heightens largely the stability in high-speed region. The effect of the hole, the geometry in the groove and the slope is small...|$|R
50|$|The 24 in bore by 28 in stroke {{cylinders}} were interchangeable {{with those}} of the Class 16E. A 4+1/2 in thick cast-iron liner was fitted between the smokebox and its saddle to obtain this interchangeability. The cylinders had cast-iron liners and the steam and exhaust valve seatings were renewable. The connecting and coupling rods were fitted with <b>floating</b> bronze <b>bushes</b> and all crank pins were hollow bored. Soft grease lubrication was used for the motion, while the coupled wheel axle boxes were hard grease lubricated.|$|R
40|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} necessary to compute the transient response of multi-mass flexible rotors are formulated to include unbalance, rotor acceleration, and flexible damped nonlinear bearing stations. A method of calculating the unbalance response of flexible rotors from a modified Myklestad-Prohl technique is discussed {{in connection with the}} method of solution for the transient response. Several special cases of simplified rotor-bearing systems are presented and analyzed for steady-state response, stability, and transient behavior. These simplified rotor models produce extensive design information necessary to insure stable performance to elastic mounted rotor-bearing systems under varying levels and forms of excitation. The nonlinear journal bearing force expressions derived from the short bearing approximation are utilized {{in the study of the}} stability and transient response of the <b>floating</b> <b>bush</b> squeeze damper support system. Both rigid and flexible rotor models are studied, and results indicate that the stability of flexible rotors supported by journal bearings can be greatly improved by the use of squeeze damper supports. Results from linearized stability studies of flexible rotors indicate that a tuned support system can greatly improve the performance of the units from the standpoint of unbalanced response and impact loading. Extensive stability and design charts may be readily produced for given rotor specifications by the computer codes presented in this analysis...|$|R
50|$|Steel {{cylinder}} liners were screwed into the heads, with their lower parts projecting into the crankcase. Steel seats for valves and sparking plugs were shrunk into the heads. The pistons were forged from alugir, with three compression and one scraper ring and <b>floating</b> bronze <b>bushes</b> for the gudgeon pins. The twelve pistons {{were connected to}} the six crankpins in pairs, each with a master and an auxiliary connecting rod. The master rods had forked big ends with white metal bearings; the auxiliary rod ends ran between the forks on bronze bushes.|$|R

The wheels were fitted with hollow crank pins, while the leading bogie was fitted with an oil bath centre pivot. The connecting and coupling rods were fitted with <b>floating</b> bronze <b>bushes</b> and were made of special chrome-nickel alloy steel of fluted section. The centre driving set of coupled wheels were flangeless and had wider treads {{than the other two}} sets to prevent them from slipping off the rails in sharp curves.|$|R

25|$|Nests may be {{built in}} a wide variety of places – on the ground, in dense <b>floating</b> vegetation, in <b>bushes,</b> or at any height in trees. They are bulky {{structures}} of rushes, sticks or other materials. Nest building is undertaken by the male initially, who will construct the nest in his territory prior to pair-bond formation. Unpaired females will visit a number of territories before settling on a male to breed with. Males may initially challenge and fight off prospective mates, and may not accept first-year females as mates. Pair-bond formation may take a few weeks. Courtship feeding is part of the bonding process, where males catch and process a snail and then feed it to the female.|$|R
