As mentioned above, the fossil type of the species is larger than Sebecus icaeorhinus with jaws and teeth even more flattened, although its general proportions are reminiscent of this species, which suggests that their skull would be higher and laterally flattened, in contrast to modern crocodilians, which generally have a horizontally flattened skull with conical teeth. Teeth are of the zyphodont kind, with very flattened sides, slightly curved back and with serrated edges with small denticles (between 5-6 denticles per millimeter {{in the teeth of}} this genus) and also without any grooves on its surface. This type of teeth appears in the close relatives of sebecids, the peirosaurids and baurusuchids of the Cretaceous and some crocodilians of the Cenozoic as the pristichampsids and some mekosuchines. These forms were land animals that used their teeth to cut and tear their prey, because the traditional method of capture of the crocodiles, using its pressure force to retain and drown his victims is not viable on land; these crocodylomorphs also had more elongated limbs, stiff back, ideal to hold the weight and give strength to run. Langston had already suggested that these teeth were indicative that this animal had more terrestrial habits than those of existing species and the Miocene contemporary crocodylians, and in the modern world only could be vaguely compared with the less aquatic habits of the caimans of the genus Paleosuchus, which have a higher muzzle and a higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>ossification</b> around the eye socket, so that they partially resemble sebecids. Busbey suggested the fact that his skull was high implied that these animals seek not to make pressure during the bite indefinitely, but to produce cuts then back quickly so that the bleeding weakens their prey slowly up to devour, similar to the current Komodo dragon, thereby adopting a strategy of stalking in areas where prey transit frequently.|$|E

50|$|Nannaroter is the {{smallest}} known ostodolepid. Like other ostodolepids, it has a wedge-shaped skull, a pointed snout, and a temporal emargination. The skull is highly ossified in order to resist anteroposteriorly directed forces. There is a large triangular pterygoid-epipterygoid complex that reinforces the posterolateral wall of the braincase. The walls of the orbits, or eye sockets, are thickened.

40|$|International audienceThe {{elemental}} carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) compositions of the whole-body and gut content of wild marine fish inhabiting the Bay of Biscay (Northeast Atlantic) were studied. Furthermore, the literature was examined for studies of aquacultured fish, reporting the elemental {{composition of the}} whole-body fish, that of their food, and nutrient assimilation and gross growth efficiencies (GGE). In both wild-caught and aquacultured fish, significant differences in C, N and P elemental composition were found between species, with P being the most variable component. Differences among species in terms of C, N and P content {{could be explained by}} varying proportions of storage compounds in whole-body fish, and varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>ossification.</b> Aquacultured fish feces were found to be P-rich, because of a lower P assimilation efficiency, compared to C or N assimilation efficiencies. Examination of aquacultured fish literature also revealed that C, N and P GGE and nutrient resupply ratios agreed with basic principles of homeostatic regulation of whole-body fish elemental composition. Extrapolation of the results to broader marine systems indicated that fish may be important for conveying nutrients toward the ocean interior...|$|R

50|$|Neoteny {{is evident}} in some larval {{specimens}} by the retention of branchial arches and a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>ossification</b> in the hyobranchial skeleton.

50|$|The {{greatest}} {{circumference of}} the head, which {{corresponds to the}} plane of the occipitofrontal diameter, averages 34.5 cm, a size too large to fit through the pelvis without flexion.

The bones of the cranium are normally connected only by a thin layer of fibroustissue that allows considerable shifting or sliding of each bone to accommodate {{the size and shape of}} the maternal pelvis.

500|$|Wing {{membranes}} {{preserved in}} pterosaur embryos are well developed, suggesting that pterosaurs {{were ready to}} fly soon after birth. Fossils of pterosaurs {{only a few days}} to a week old (called [...] "flaplings") have been found, representing several pterosaur families, including pterodactylids, rhamphorhinchids, ctenochasmatids and azhdarchids. All preserve bones that show a relatively high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> hardening (<b>ossification)</b> for their age, and wing proportions similar to adults. In fact, many pterosaur flaplings have been considered adults and placed in separate species in the past. Additionally, flaplings are normally found in the same sediments as adults and juveniles of the same species, such as the Pterodactylus and Rhamphorhynchus flaplings found in the Solnhofen limestone of Germany, and Pterodaustro flaplings from Brazil. All are found in deep aquatic environment far from shore.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} study the bony factors contributing to the narrowness of the spinal canal with the advance in age using 106 macerated vertebral columns of Japanese subjects. The following results were obtained : 1. Posterior osteophytes were classified according to three <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> development. These were first found in the twenties, with the proportion of affected spines increasing thereafter. Osteophytes <b>of</b> higher <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> development increased with the advance in age. As for localization, posterior osteophytes were frequently seen adjacent to the intervertebral discs where {{a high incidence of}} degeneration has been reported. The highest frequency of these was seen in the cervical region, and followed by the lumbar region. 2. <b>Ossifications</b> <b>of</b> the posterior longitudinal ligament at its vertebral attachment were classified according to four <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> development. These were first seen in the twenties, with the incidence increasing thereafter. <b>Ossifications</b> <b>of</b> higher <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> development increased with the advance in age. Localization resembled that of posterior osteophytes, the highest frequency of these being seen in the cervical region, followed by the lumbar region. 3. <b>Ossifications</b> <b>of</b> the ligamentum flavum at its vertebral attachment were classified according to three <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> development.

5000|$|The {{habitat of}} Caiuajara was a desert with dunes. The layers {{in which the}} fossils were found had been {{deposited}} in a lake in the desert; probably the bones had been exposed at the surface around the lake for a time and were then by storms blown into it, eventually sinking to the bottom. Possibly the same storms caused many individuals to die together; this could also {{have been the result}} of droughts. A succession of layers shows that the lake was likely inhabited by the pterosaurs for a great length of time, although it is also possible they visited the lake during regular migrations. Fossil plants — tapejarids are often assumed to have been herbivores — have not been found, so there are no direct indications about the food source. Likewise, remains of invertebrates have not been discovered. The large concentrations of fossils, among pterosaurs very rare and only equalled by those found of the Argentine form Pterodaustro, were by the describers seen as proof of a gregarious lifestyle, Caiuajara living in colonies. The many specimens also allowed to determine a growth series, the first such an ontogenetic sequence for pterosaurs of which it is nearly certain that it really represented a single species. The age of the exemplars can be determined, not just from size but also by the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>ossification,</b> especially of the breastbone, the long bones and the wrist, and the fusion of the shoulder blade and coracoid into a scapulocoracoid. It showed that juvenile individuals, the smallest specimens of which have a wingspan of about sixty-five centimetres, generally had the same proportions as adults. Especially important is that their humeri are not proportionally smaller and their humeral deltopectoral crests, the attachments of the main flight muscles, are not less developed, attaining a size of 38 to 40% of the humeral shaft length. This suggests that they were precocial, taking wing almost as soon as they hatched; parental care must have been limited. This might have been typical of all derived pterosaurs. The snout crest however, strongly changed during growth. It became much taller and also much more steeply inclined, from about 115° to 90°. Although the snout as a whole also became more massive, the snout tip inclination relative to the jaw edge remained the same. At the back of the skull an additional projection developed. Furthermore, the dentary crest on the lower jaw strongly increased in size. No specimens have been found lacking the snout crest, indicating that Caiuajara was in this respect not sexually dimorphic and casting doubt on the hypothesis that pterosaurs normally were.|$|E

The mechanical model concerns the entire human skull (bony structure and sutures) as well as the jackscrew device; the latter transforms the manual openings into orthodontic forces usually applied to the two maxillary halves through the first premolars and first permanent molars, which are the support points of the appliance. A sensitivity analysis of an approximate finite element model is performed in order to investigate the influence of the model size, the influence <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> sutural <b>ossification</b> by assigning different mechanical properties to the sutures and the influence of bone relaxation concerning the effects of dentofacial orthopaedics. Moreover, a more accurate model including the aforementioned teeth and their periodontal ligament as solid elastic structures was analysed in order to evaluate the orthodontic effects induced. Results refer to the opening pattern and associated stresses/displacements/strains on the cranium, the maxillae and the periodontal ligament. (c) 2006 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose, a dry human skull with artificially constructed teeth was used. In addition, a 3 D finite element model including the craniofacial sutures was developed based on computed tomography (CT) scans. Initially, two types of models were analysed. In the first model, the total activation of the jackscrew device was applied in one step. In the second model, more steps were applied, {{taking into account the}} phenomenon of stress relaxation during RME treatment. Afterwards, a parametric analysis of the finite element method model was performed using three more models in order to evaluate the influence of craniofacial sutures. Both in vitro and finite element results refer to the openings of four critical points (MI, UM, EM, and CN) on the left and right maxilla. Results show that the maxillae open in a pyramidal shape and that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> sutures <b>ossification</b> influences the displacement distribution on the craniofacial complex much more than the phenomenon of stres relaxation.

40|$|The {{reported}} {{results of}} acetabular cage reconstruction for pelvic deficiency are widely variable. Our primary question was: {{what is the}} survivorship of cage reconstruction with a primary end point of cage revision and secondary end points of radiographic loosening and any reoperation? Secondary questions were: which factors predict cage failure, {{and what is the}} functional outcome (SF- 36, WOMAC, Harris hip score) of this reconstructive method? We reviewed 72 cage reconstructions in 68 patients. Minimum followup was 1. 2  years (mean, 5. 1  years; range, 1. 2 – 10. 7  years). Five-year cage revision-free survivorship was 87. 8 %. Five-year loosening-free and acetabular reoperation-free survivorships were 80. 7 % and 81. 3 %, respectively. No single preoperative factor (age, gender, severity <b>of</b> pelvic defect, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> heterotopic <b>ossification,</b> difference in limb lengths and centers of rotation) or intraoperative factor (type of bone graft, type of cage, changes in limb length and center of rotation) predicted cage failure.

40|$|SUMMARY: Enlarged parietal {{foramina}} {{are believed}} to be benign and familial and due to a variable <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> defective intramembranous <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> the parietal bones. We report 2 patients with this condition in whom fetal and neonatal MR imaging studies illustrate the antenatal and perinatal evolution of this condition and the associated persistence of a falcine sinus. We discuss its relationship to the spectrum of cephalocoeles. Enlarged symmetrical parietal or frontal foramina and cra-niumbifidum{{are believed to}} represent variable expression of the same genetic defect, depending on the age and pheno-typic heterogeneity of the patient. 1 They are remnants of ar-rested fetal cranial development and can be very large and midline at birth but usually close duringmid-childhood, leav-ing only paired foramina in the parietal or frontal bones, which may persist throughout life. Because high-resolution antenatal sonography andMR imaging (MRI), as well as neo-natal MRI, allow early detection of cranial and intracranial anomalies, the developmental features of this benign condi-tion should be recognized.

40|$|Development {{consists}} {{of growth and}} differentiation, which can be partially decoupled and can be affected by environmental factors to different extents. In amphibians, variation in the larval environment influences development and causes changes in post-metamorphic shape. We examined post-metamorphic consequences, both morphological and locomotory, of alterations in growth and development. We reared tadpoles of two phylogenetically and ecologically distant frog species (the red-eyed treefrog Agalychnis callidryas and the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis) under different temperatures with ad libitum food supply and under different food levels at a constant temperature. Low temperature and low food levels both resulted in similarly extended larval periods.

The fact that the cervical vertebrae not only have ossified centra and neural arches, but also have ossified zygapophyses, led Cheng et al. to conclude that this embryo may in fact represent a hatchling, since in modern chickens and skuas these zygaphyses are cartilaginous until hatching. Also, the embryo's foot anatomy (specifically, the proportions of its metatarsals) resembles that of the oviraptorid Heyuannia huangi, indicating that these eggs belong to H. huangi or a similar species.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endochondral <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> the otic capsule is {{a process}} that {{continues}} postnatally; hence, incomplete endochondral ossification is seen as pericochlear hypoattenuation on temporal bone CT scans of children. We determined the prevalence and extent of this entity in a large series and assessed its relation to age and underlying sensorineural hearing loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially, temporal bone CTs of 40 children with sensorineural hearing loss were retrospectively assessed and compared with those of a control group scanned for non-sensorineural hearing loss reasons to assess any difference in the prevalence or extent <b>of</b> incomplete endochondral <b>ossification.</b> Then the CT scans of 510 children (age range, 17 days to 17 years) were retrospectively reviewed, and any observed endochondral ossification areas were classified as mild, moderate, or extensive, according to their extent. RESULTS: Neither the presence nor <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> incomplete endochondral <b>ossification</b> had any significant correlation with the presence of sensorineural hearing loss (P =. 08 and P =. 1, respectively). Incomplete endochondral ossification was more frequently seen (62 % of cases) than complete ossification. There was no statistically significant correlation between incomplete endochondral ossification and sex (P =. 8), but an inverse correlation was found between the presence <b>of</b> incomplete endochondral <b>ossification</b> and increasing age (P <. 001). Overall, mild incomplete endochondral ossification was the most frequent involvement pattern (44. 4 %).

The relationships between fetal body weight and sex, intrauterine position, uterine horn, horn size, and litter size were determined using historical control data (7594 fetuses; 769 litters) of untreated rats. Relationships between body weight and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>ossification</b> were examined in a subset of 1484 historical control fetuses (154 litters) which were subsequently cleared and stained with alizarin red S. Fetal weight was independent of horn size, uterine horn side (left or right) or intrauterine position. Males were heavier than females and fetal weight decreased with increasing litter size. Evaluation of the skeleton showed that ossification of sternum, metacarpus and metatarsus was extensively complete and independent of fetal weight on pregnancy day 21. In contrast, the extent of ossification of fore- and hindlimb phalanges and of cervical and sacrococcygeal vertebrae was dependent on fetal body weight. The strongest correlation between body weight and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>ossification</b> was found for hindlimb, medial and proximal phalanges. Our data therefore suggest that, in full-term rat fetuses (day 21), reduced ossification of sternum, metacarpus and metatarsus results from a localized impairment of bone calcification (i. e., a malformation or variation) rather than from general growth retardation and that ossification of hindlimb (medial and proximal) phalanges is a good indicator of treatment-induced fetal growth retardation...|$|E
