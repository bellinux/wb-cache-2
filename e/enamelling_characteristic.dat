40|$|Introduction: An {{appropriate}} {{selection of}} instruments {{is essential to}} perform a correct debonding technique, by properly removing orthodontic brackets and the remaining resin. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate three methods of remaining resin removal on enamel surface after bracket debonding, by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Methods: Eighteen bovine incisors were selected and divided into three groups (A, B and C) of six teeth each. Before bracket bonding, epoxy resin casts were obtained by impression of the teeth with addition silicon, in order to register baseline <b>enamel</b> <b>characteristics</b> and representing the control group. The methods for remaining resin removal were: Group A - gross and medium granulation Soflex discs; Group B - carbide bur in low-speed; Group C - carbide bur in high-speed. Soflex polishing system fine and ultrafine granulation discs were used for Group A, rubber tips for Groups B and C, and polishing paste for all groups. After polishing, impression of teeth were taken and casts were analyzed by means of SEM. The baseline <b>enamel</b> <b>characteristics</b> (Control Group) were compared to the final aspect of enamel to determine the method that generated less enamel abrasion. Results and Conclusion: The remaining resin removal by carbide bur in low-rotation, and enamel polished with rubber tips followed by polishing paste produced the smaller damage to the enamel...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{being an}} {{interface}} between two mechanically mismatched {{phases of the}} soft dentine and hard enamel, the dentine-enamel junction (DEJ) in a human tooth is in general capable of withstanding a long working life of repeated dynamic loading. The current poor understanding of the structure and properties of the DEJ has presented a major obstacle to designing better therapeutic protocols for complications concerning the DEJ. In this investigation, {{it was discovered that}} the DEJ is a thin, but gradual interface with characteristics transiting from those of dentine to those of enamel. The collagen fibres in dentine enter into the enamel side of the DEJ and terminate in a region in which the hydroxyapatite crystals begin to show <b>enamel</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Using focused ion beam machining, micro-beams were fabricated from regions within 50 μm of the DEJ and were subjected to bend tests. In spite of the similarity in the flexural strength of the DEJ and enamel, fractographs revealed cracks in the DEJ that propagated along structures with dentine characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the testing of the mechanical properties of the DEJ. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Enamel, a {{structure}} of epithelial origin, represents a protective tooth cover. The cells responsible {{for the formation of}} enamel, ameloblasts, are lost at the time of tooth eruption, so that enamel becomes an acellular structure that can no longer regenerate. In order to compensate for this particular phenomenon, enamel has acquired a complex structural organization and a high mineralization degree, in its mature state. This reflects the particular life cycle of ameloblasts and the unique physico-chemical characteristics of matrix proteins, which regulate the formation of the extremely long crystals of <b>enamel.</b> These <b>characteristics</b> differentiate <b>enamel</b> from all the other tissues of the organism...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Many {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} re-etched enamel by using {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM); however, {{there is no evidence}} regarding the use of Erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Er:YAG) laser at primary and secondary bonding instead of acid etching with regards to enamel surface changes. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine that whether or not the methods of primary and secondary enamel preparation affect <b>enamel</b> <b>characteristics</b> after rebonding, by using SEM analysis. Materials and Methods: Twelve freshly extracted premolars were divided into 4 groups. The samples in each group were conditioned by acid etchant or Er:YAG laser at primary conditioning, according to the instructions. Afterwards, they were bonded with orthodontic brackets. After debonding, the samples were prepared for second conditioning. Also, two samples were conditioned only once with acid etchant or laser, to compare enamel morphology changes with those after re-etching. Finally, buccal enamel surfaces were evaluated using SEM. Results: Enamel etching patterns were observed in the samples which had been acid-conditioned at first or at both conditionings. The samples irradiated by Er:YAG laser showed amorphous and irregular surfaces, with no signs of typical etching patterns. A large deep gap was seen in one of the samples irradiated with laser at primary and secondary conditionings, which might have penetrated the underling layers of enamel and dentin. Conclusions: Enamel surface preparation with Er:YAG laser produces irregular and indistinct morphologic changes, completely different from those produced after acid etching at both conditioning and reconditioning. Therefore, it is recommended to use this laser with caution to avoid permanent enamel damage. </div...|$|R

40|$|The {{abundant}} amelogenin proteins {{are responsible}} for generating proper enamel thickness and structure, and most amelogenins include a conserved hydrophilic C-terminus. To evaluate {{the importance of the}} C-terminus, we generated transgenic mice that express an amelogenin lacking the C-terminal 13 amino acids (CTRNC). MicroCT analysis of TgCTRNC 29 teeth (low transgene number) indicated that molar enamel density was similar to that of wild-type mice, but TgCTRNC 18 molar enamel (high transgene number) was deficient, indicating that extra transgene copies were associated with a more severe phenotype. When amelogenin-null (KO) and TgCTRNC transgenic mice were mated, density and volume of molar enamel from TgCTRNCKO offspring were not different from those of KO mice, indicating that neither TgCTRNC 18 nor TgCTRNC 29 rescued <b>enamel’s</b> physical <b>characteristics.</b> Because transgenic full-length amelogenin partially rescues both density and volume of KO molar enamel, it was concluded that the amelogenin C-terminus is essential for proper enamel density, volume, and organization...|$|R
30|$|As teeth {{consist of}} several materials, there are mutual {{junctions}} among them. For example, a dentine–enamel junction (DEJ) {{is a thin}} [2.0  ±  1.1  μm (Habelitz et al. 2001)] but gradual interface with characteristics transiting from those of dentine to those of enamel. Namely, the collagen fibers in dentine were found {{to enter into the}} enamel side of DEJ and terminate in a region in which crystals of biological apatite begin to show <b>enamel</b> <b>characteristics</b> (Chan et al. 2011). In addition, the average contents of organic matrix and carbonate ions were found to increase in the order: enamel < DEJ < dentin. Furthermore, HPO 4 2 − ions were not detected in the DEJ, while in dentin their content was higher than in enamel (Kolmas et al. 2010). Comparable results were obtained in another study (Desoutter et al. 2014). Besides, both chemical and molecular structure of DEJ appeared to be dependent on the intratooth location (Xu et al. 2009). Genetically, it is a remnant of the onset of enamel formation because enamel grows outwards from this junction (Nanci 2012). Mechanically, DEJ {{plays an important role in}} preventing crack propagation from enamel into dentine (Imbeni et al. 2005). Hierarchically, DEJ has a three-level structure: 25 – 100  μm scallops with their convexities directed toward the dentin and concavities toward the enamel, 2 – 5  μm microscallops and a smaller scale structure (Marshall et al. 2003). Therefore, high-resolution elastic modulus mapping has indicated that the DEJ is a band with a graded mechanical property rather than a discrete interface (Sui et al. 2014). The major steps of enamel crystal growth at the junction have been described above but the mechanism of the junction formation is still debatable. Some authors claim that enamel crystals grow epitaxially on the pre-existing dentine crystals because of a high continuity between enamel and dentine crystals (Arsenault and Robinson 1989; Hayashi 1992, 1993). Others have shown that enamel crystals are formed at a given distance from the dentine surface (Simmer and Fincham 1995; Diekwisch et al. 1995; Aoba 1996; Bodier-Houllé et al. 2000) and could either reach dentine crystals by a subsequent growth (Takano et al. 1996) or remain distant (Bodier-Houllé et al. 2000; Dong and Warshawsky 1996). In addition, there are both a cementum–enamel junction (CEJ) (Wang et al. 2006 b), which is quite similar to DEJ, and a cementum–dentine junction (CDJ) (Ho et al. 2004, 2005; Jang et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that nanoHAP reduces enamel surface roughness, its potential positive effect on the color stability following orthodontic debonding was investigated in the present study. Our results showed that 10 -day application of nanoHAP serum did not significantly reduce the amount of enamel color discolorations compared to the HAP toothpaste group. This finding was in accordance with the outcome surface roughness analysis. In addition, the absorption of coffee pigments by remnant resin tags may outweigh any probable differences in <b>enamel</b> surface <b>characteristics.</b> Both groups in this investigation indicated significant change in L*, a*, and b* following 1 -week immersion in coffee solution. Generally, the mean L* value decreased while the mean b* increased in both groups representing darker and more yellowish color for the teeth. The mean values of total color change (ΔE) were greater than 3.7 units, a standard value of clinical detection [27], in both groups. However, differences between the groups with respect to the mean ΔE value and also the number of teeth which exceeded this threshold value (ΔE[*]>[*] 3.7) tended to be significantly lower in the nanoHAP group. With a larger sample size, the color parameters may reach the significant level.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effects of {{different}} enamel conditioning techniques for bracket bonding. Methods: Ninety-one human premolars were randomly divided in six groups of 15 specimens each. The enamel surfaces of the teeth were etched with 35 % orthophosphoric acid in Group 1, with a self-etching primer in Group 2, sandblasted in Group 3, sandblasted and etched with 35 % orthophosphoric acid in Group 4, conditioned by Er:YAG laser in Group 5 and conditioned by Er:YAG laser and etched with 35 % phosphoric acid gel respectively in Group 6. After enamel conditioning procedures, brackets were bonded and shear bonding test was performed. After debonding, adhesive remnant index scores were calculated for all groups. One tooth from each group were inspected by scanning electron microscope for evaluating the <b>enamel</b> surface <b>characteristics.</b> Results: The laser and acid etched group showed the highest mean shear bond strength (SBS) value (13. 61 ± 1. 14 MPa) while sandblasted group yielded the lowest value (3. 12 ± 0. 61 MPa).

Therefore, acid etching and self-etching techniques were found to be safer for orthodontic bracket bonding. Sandblasting method was found to generate inadequate bonding strength.

MÉTODOS: foram selecionados 18 incisivos bovinos, divididos em três grupos (A, B e C), contendo 6 dentes cada. Previamente à colagem do braquete, os dentes foram moldados com silicone de adição e preenchidos com resina epóxi, para o registro das características do esmalte, assim formando o Grupo Controle. Os métodos de remoção da resina remanescente utilizados foram: Grupo A - Soflex granulações grossa e média; Grupo B - broca Carbide em baixa rotação; Grupo C - broca Carbide em alta rotação. Polimento com Soflex granulações fina e ultrafina no Grupo A, pontas de borracha nos grupos B e C, e pasta de polimento para esmalte nos três grupos. Após cada etapa de remoção da resina remanescente e polimento, os dentes foram novamente moldados, duplicados e as réplicas analisadas em MEV. Foram, então, comparadas as características do esmalte inicial (Grupo Controle) com o aspecto do esmalte após as etapas de remoção de resina, assim possibilitando avaliar o método que gerou menor abrasão ao esmalte.

30|$|Controversial {{evidence}} has been reported so far {{on the effect of}} stripping on enamel morphology and roughness. SEM studies [19, 20] showed that perforated diamond-coated disks with less than 30 -μm grain size minimized grinding defects, whereas subsequent polishing with fine and extra-fine alumina disks (Sof-Lex, 3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) produced smooth surfaces, equally to or smoother than untreated enamel. Nevertheless, {{the results of this study}} were mainly based on subjective qualitative assessment of <b>enamel</b> morphological <b>characteristics.</b> On the other hand, qualitative assessment by SEM and quantitative assessment of the amplitude parameter Ra by in-line stylus profilometry [21] showed that stripping disks and diamond-coated metal strips followed by fine Sof-Lex disks produced significantly rougher surfaces in comparison with the intact enamel of permanent and deciduous teeth. Qualitative (scanning electron microscopy) and quantitative (surface roughness test) measurements by Gupta et al. [22] also showed that the enamel after stripping with diamond disks and different polishing methods was significantly rougher than untreated control teeth. To improve the reliability of quantitative analysis, 3 D optical profilometry was used to determine the Ra values by scanning sample areas rather than performing in-line analysis on enamel areas [23]. The results showed that grinding and polishing with automatic oscillating systems, including Ortho-Strips, resulted in equally smooth surfaces with untreated enamel, or even better. These systems are considered to provide better results than other common stripping techniques, where enamel defects have been observed [12, 14, 24].|$|R

50|$|In rodents, HSB {{are usually}} {{present in the}} PI. Three types of HSB can be separated—pauciserial, uniserial, and multiserial. Pauciserial HSB, present in some {{primitive}} Paleogene rodents, are usually three to six prisms thick and have inter-prismatic matrix (IPM) surrounding the prisms, which have irregular cross-sections. Uniserial HSB, present in most living rodents, consist of a single layer of prisms. Multiserial HSB, three to seven prisms thick, characterize the living Hystricognathi and the gundis (Ctenodactylidae) and springhares (Pedetes). There are three subtypes {{on the basis of}} the orientation of the IPM. In the first, the IPM runs mostly parallel to the HSB, but does not surround it as in pauciserial enamel; in the second, the IPM makes an angle of about 45° with the HSB; and in the third, the two are located at right angles to each other. The last type serves to further strengthen the <b>enamel</b> and is <b>characteristic</b> of the Octodontoidea.|$|R

The aim of {{present study was to}} evaluate the effect of 10 % sodium ascorbate on bleached bovine enamel morphology and microhardness considering the possibility of its effect on <b>enamel</b> surface <b>characteristics.</b> A total of 69 bovine enamel slabs were prepared and mounted in acrylic resin. Subsequent to polishing, they were randomly divided into 3 groups of 23 specimens each; 3 for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis and 20 for hardness test. In group 1 the specimens were immersed in distilled water as control group; in group 2 the specimens were bleached with 35 % carbamide peroxide for 30 min a week for 3 consecutive weeks; and in group 3 the specimens were exposed to 10 % sodium ascorbate for 30 min subsequent to bleaching similar to group 1. After 3 weeks Vickers hardness of the specimens was measured at 3 points with equal distances from each other under a force of 50 g. The mean of the hardness values of each specimen was calculated and data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA (P < 0. 05). The highest and lowest microhardness values were observed in group 1 and group 2, respectively. However, there were no statistically significant differences in microhardness between the groups (P = 0. 12).

40|$|Caries {{prevention}} {{should be}} an important goal of the dentistry practitioner. In addition to traditional preventive techniques, laser beam has been a recent suggestion. This study aimed to evaluate Nd:YAG laser treatment effects on dental enamel surfaces, irradiated at different energy levels, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and surface micro-hardness tests to evaluate if caries prevention {{can be achieved by}} laser treatment. Forty human teeth were divided in four groups of 10 specimens each: in three groups the enamel surface was treated with three different laser beam energy levels, 60, 120 and 160 mJ, in one group the enamel was not lased. Five samples from each group were subjected to the Vickers microhardness test and five samples underwent SEM investigation. Results of the microhardness test demonstrated no significant differences between treated and non-treated dental enamel samples. SEM observation demonstrated a rougher enamel surface in all treated groups: the 60 mJ treated group showed tooth surfaces with vertical scratches, the 120 mJ treated group showed the enamel surface covered by craters and cracks, and the 160 mJ treated group showed a completely changed enamel structure with columns separated by voids and with a glass-like surface. These investigations demonstrated that dental enamel laser treatment at low energy levels (not > 60 mJ) produces a protective glass-like surface, without the loss of its integrity and could be an advisable technique to prevent caries. Higher energy laser treatment leads to modifications of the enamel morphology such as craters and cracks, even if it does not cause any change in <b>enamel</b> hardness <b>characteristics,</b> which could be more useful in conservative dentistry...|$|R
40|$|Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a {{group of}} {{inherited}} conditions featuring isolated enamel malformations. About 5 % of AI cases show an X-linked pattern of inheritance, which are caused by mutations in AMELX. In humans there are two, non-allelic amelogenin genes: AMELX (Xp 22. 3) and AMELY (Yp 11. 2). About 90 % of amelogenin expression is from AMELX, which is nested within intron 1 of the gene encoding Rho GTPase activating protein 6 (ARHGAP 6). We recruited two AI families and determined that their disease-causing mutations were partial deletions in ARHGAP 6 that completely deleted AMELX. Affected males in both families had a distinctive enamel phenotype resembling "snow-capped" teeth. The 96, 240 bp deletion in family 1 was confined to intron 1 of ARHGAP 6 (g. 302534 _ 398773 del 96240), but removed alternative ARHGAP 6 promoters 1 c and 1 d. Analyses of developing teeth in mice showed that ARHGAP 6 is not expressed from these promoters in ameloblasts. The 52, 654 bp deletion in family 2 (g. 363924 _ 416577 del 52654 insA) removed ARHGAP 6 promoter 1 d and exon 2, precluding normal expression of ARHGAP 6. The male proband of family 2 had slightly thinner enamel with greater surface roughness, but exhibited the same pattern of <b>enamel</b> malformations <b>characteristic</b> of males in family 1, which themselves showed minor variations in their enamel phenotypes. We conclude that the enamel defects in both families were caused by amelogenin insufficiency, that deletion of AMELX results in males with a <b>characteristic</b> snow-capped <b>enamel</b> phenotype, and failed ARHGAP 6 expression did not appreciably alter the severity of enamel defects when AMELX was absent...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} signs of dental erosion, {{including}} changes in appearance and sensitivity. One {{of the physical}} changes can be the color of teeth. There are two different colors teeth may turn if dental erosion is occurring, the first being a change of color that usually happens {{on the cutting edge}} of the central incisors. This causes the cutting edge of the tooth to become transparent. A second sign is if the tooth has a yellowish tint. This occurs because the white enamel has eroded away to reveal the yellowish dentin. [...] A change in shape of the teeth is also a sign of dental erosion. Teeth will begin to appear with a broad rounded concavity, and the gaps between teeth will become larger. There can be evidence of wear on surfaces of teeth not expected to be in contact with one another. [...] If dental erosion occurs in children, a loss of <b>enamel</b> surface <b>characteristics</b> can occur. Amalgam restorations in the mouth may be clean and non-tarnished. Fillings may also appear to be rising out of the tooth, the appearance being caused when the tooth is eroded away leaving only the filling. The teeth may form divots on the chewing surfaces when dental erosion is occurring. This mainly happens on the first, second, and third molars. One of the most severe signs of dental erosion is cracking, where teeth begin to crack off and become coarse. [...] Other signs include pain when eating hot, cold, or sweet foods. This pain is due to the enamel having been eroded away, exposing the sensitive dentin.|$|R
30|$|Enamel {{is made of}} 20 – 40 -nm-sized {{particles}} of hydroxyapatite (HAP) [17, 18]. It {{has been suggested that}} 20 -nm-sized HAP termed as nanohydroxyapatite (nanoHAP) is the most biocompatible and bioactive form of the synthesized apatites, due to the close similarity to the basic structures of the enamel [15, 16]. NanoHAP has a higher surface area and strong affinity to the <b>enamel</b> surface. These <b>characteristics</b> facilitate its attachment to the enamel surface compared to the large and amorphous types [15, 16]. Interestingly, a layer of nanoHAP formed on the enamel surface is highly resistant to acid solution that subsequently can protect underlying enamel from the future demineralization [15]. Several studies [19 – 22] have evaluated the effect of nanoHAP on the enamel and dentin remineralization and its preventive potential on dental demineralization. It has been also suggested that the nanoHAP particles could repair bleaching-related microscopic defects of the enamel and thereby improving the post-bleaching sensitivities [23]. Some research teams and manufacturers have proposed that nanoHAP could reduce the enamel surface roughness [24, 25].|$|R
40|$|Teeth {{have been}} missing from Aves for almost 100 million years. However, it is {{believed}} that the avian oral epithelium retains the molecular signaling required to induce odontogenesis, and this has been widely examined using heterospecific recombinations with mouse dental mesenchyme. It has also been argued that teeth can form from the avian oral epithelium owing to contamination of the mouse mesenchyme with mouse dental epithelial cells. To investigate the possibility of tooth formation from chick oral epithelium and the characteristics of possible chick enamel, we applied LacZ transgenic mice during heterospecific recombination and examined the further tooth formation. Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify the two tissues during development after heterospecific recombination. No mixing was detected between chick oral epithelium and mouse dental mesenchyme after 2 days, and secretory ameloblasts with Tomes' processes were observed after 1 week. Teeth were formed after 3 weeks with a single cusp pattern, possibly determined by epithelial factors, which {{is similar to that of}} the avian tooth in the late Jurassic period.

30|$|Dental {{fluorosis}} in {{the anterior}} teeth affects the tooth appearance, and severe dental fluorosis with tooth defects in posterior teeth negatively influences mastication [5]. Restorations, such as crowns, inlays, or onlays, are often required {{to restore the}} teeth damaged by dental fluorosis [6, 7]. Matching of the mechanical behavior of the restorative material {{to that of the}} opposing tooth enamel is especially important to prevent excessive wear of the natural tooth enamel or the applied material itself [8 – 11]. Ceramics are widely used as restorative materials because of their high biocompatibility and similar esthetics to the natural tooth enamel [47]. However, ceramics present high wear resistance, which causes excessive wear of the opposing natural tooth enamel [47, 48]. Materials with low wear resistance, such as PICN and composite resin block, have been developed as alternatives to ceramics [48, 49]. PICN exhibits a wear resistance {{similar to that of the}} outer layer of the normal tooth enamel. Thus, when the opposing tooth is a normal tooth, PICN is the proper material for restoration. However, the opposing tooth in dental fluorosis requiring restoration likely presents mild dental fluorosis. In this case, materials with nanotribological properties similar to those of the mild dental fluorosis enamel are necessary to restore dental fluorosis. Conventional composite resins, such as Z 350, reveal a wear resistance lower than that of the outer layer of mild dental fluorosis; such a characteristic may lead to increased wear of the restorative materials. Composite resin block, such as LUV, is fabricated under high temperatures and high pressures and possesses mechanical properties superior to those of the conventional composite resins [50]. In the present study, composite resin block showed a wear resistance similar to that of the outer layer of the mild dental fluorosis <b>enamel.</b> This <b>characteristic</b> implies that this material is appropriate for use as restorative material for dental fluorosis. As the nanomechanical behavior of dental fluorosis enamel determines the selection of the restorative material, the appropriate material should be applied for dental fluorosis to achieve better clinical outcomes. Thus, additional studies on the nanomechanical behavior of dental fluorosis enamel should be conducted, and novel restorative materials should be further developed.|$|R

We report a draft annotated assembly of the beaver genome, the first for a large rodent and the first mammalian genome assembled directly from uncorrected and moderate coverage (< 30 ×) long reads generated by single-molecule sequencing. The genome size is 2. 7 Gb estimated by k-mer analysis. We assembled the beaver genome using the new Canu assembler optimized for noisy reads. The resulting assembly was refined using Pilon supported by short reads (80 ×) and checked for accuracy by congruency against an independent short read assembly. We scaffolded the assembly using the exon–gene models derived from 9805 full-length open reading frames (FL-ORFs) constructed from the beaver leukocyte and muscle transcriptomes. The final assembly comprised 22, 515 contigs with an N 50 of 278, 680 bp and an N 50 -scaffold of 317, 558 bp. Maximum contig and scaffold lengths were 3. 3 and 4. 2 Mb, respectively, with a combined scaffold length representing 92 % of the estimated genome size.

SETTING: College of Dentistry, University of Iowa. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The brackets were bonded to extracted human teeth {{according to one of}} three protocols; Group I (Control) : Teeth were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid. After applying the sealant, the brackets were bonded with Transbond XT (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, California, USA) and light cured for 20 seconds. Group II: A self-etch acidic primer (ESPE Dental AG, Seefeld, Germany) was placed on the enamel for 15 seconds and gently evaporated with air as suggested by the manufacturer. The brackets were then bonded with Transbond XT as in the first group. Group III: A new experimental self-etch primer EXL# 547 (3 M ESPE, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA), was rubbed on the enamel for 10 seconds and left to stand for 20 seconds before it was air-dried and then light cured for 10 seconds. The brackets were then bonded as in groups I and II RESULTS: The present in vitro findings indicated that the shear bond strengths of the three groups were significantly different (P= 0. 018). Duncan multiple range tests indicated that Prompt L-Pop had a significantly lower (mean = 7. 1 ± 4. 4 MPa) shear bond strength than both the new EXL# 547 self- etch primer (mean = 9. 7 ± 3. 7 MPa) or phosphoric acid and the conventional adhesive system (mean = 10. 4 ± 2. 8 MPa). CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicated that the newly introduced self-etch primers, containing both the enamel etchant and primer have the potential to be successfully used in bonding orthodontic brackets...|$|R
