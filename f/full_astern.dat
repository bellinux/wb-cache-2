He was traveling {{on the west side of}} the channel; this gave him no choice but to turn the ship to the starboard, which, had the ferry turned, would have meant that the ship turned toward the ferry. The pilot also feared striking a bridge pier construction site just upriver, or running aground or into one of the ships docked at the grain elevator.|$|E
500|$|Jones {{first made}} several {{attempts}} {{to back the}} ship off the rocks, running the engines at <b>full</b> <b>astern,</b> to no avail. Despite her position, the ship {{did not appear to}} be in danger of sinking. The captain ordered the distress rockets to be fired, and a local rescue effort ensued, with all the passengers and crew escaping to shore safely.|$|E
500|$|Early in the evening, Voyager had no {{difficulties}} maintaining {{her position}} during the manoeuvres both ships performed. Following {{a series of}} turns intended to reverse the courses of both ships beginning at 8:40pm, Voyager ended up to starboard of Melbourne. At 8:52pm, Voyager was ordered to resume the plane guard station. The procedure to accomplish this required Voyager {{to turn away from}} Melbourne in a large circle, cross behind the carrier, then take position off Melbournes port side. Instead, Voyager first turned to starboard, away from Melbourne, then turned to port without warning. It was initially assumed by Melbournes bridge crew that Voyager was conducting a series of tight turns to lose speed before swinging behind Melbourne, but Voyager did not alter course again. At 8:55pm, with Voyager approaching, Melbournes navigator ordered the carrier's engines to half astern speed, with Robertson ordering an increase to <b>full</b> <b>astern</b> a few seconds later. At the same time, Stevens, having just become aware of the situation, gave the order [...] "Full ahead both engines. Hard-a starboard.", before instructing the destroyer's Quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent. Both ships' measures were too late to avoid a collision; Melbourne hit Voyager at 8:56pm.|$|E
500|$|The {{wreck of}} the ship was {{directly}} {{in the path of}} Nassau; to avoid it, the ship had to steer sharply towards the IIIBattle Squadron.

50|$|On {{the morning}} of the 31st, William Ward Burrows once more ran up her engines at <b>full</b> speed <b>astern</b> in another attempt to free the ship. At 1100, she went to general {{quarters}} when she received word of approaching Japanese planes - unable to maneuver and hard aground, the ship was still in a vulnerable position. Again, however, good fortune was with the ship, for the air raid never materialized.|$|R
50|$|The new Rangatira had turbo-electric transmission, {{with twin}} turbo {{generators}} and electric propulsion motors built by AEI of Manchester. In addition she had bow thrusters for easier berthing. Compared {{with the more}} common reduction gearing between steam turbines and propeller shafts, turbo-electric transmission has lower energy conversion efficiency and an inferior power-to-weight ratio. But it gives quicker manoeuvrability, being able to change propeller speed more quickly and also give <b>full</b> power <b>astern</b> if needed.|$|R
2500|$|At 8:55pm, with Voyager still {{turning to}} port, Melbournes {{navigator}} ordered the carrier's engines to half astern speed, with Robertson ordering an increase to <b>full</b> <b>astern</b> {{a few seconds}} later. At the same time, Stevens, returning to Voyagers bridge from the nearby chart table, gave the order [...] "Full ahead both engines. Hard a-starboard.", before instructing the destroyer's Quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent. Both ships' measures were too late to avoid a collision; Melbourne hit Voyager at 8:56pm.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sea trials}} {{consisted}} {{of a number of}} tests of her handling characteristics, carried out first in Belfast Lough and then in the open waters of the Irish Sea. Over the course of about 12 hours, Titanic was driven at different speeds, the turning ability was tested and a [...] "crash stop" [...] was performed in which the engines were reversed full ahead to <b>full</b> <b>astern,</b> bringing her to a stop in [...] or 3 minutes and 15 seconds. The ship covered a distance of about , averaging [...] and reaching a maximum speed of just under [...]|$|E
2500|$|On Voyagers bridge, {{the officer}} of the watch and the {{navigator}} had become distracted, and Stevens was reading navigational charts, impairing his night vision. The port bridge lookout had come on duty while Voyager was turning to starboard, and raised the alarm when the swing back to port brought Melbourne back into view around 20:55. Melbournes navigation officer ordered the carrier's engines to half speed astern around the same time, which Captain Robertson increased to <b>full</b> <b>astern</b> a few seconds later. At the same time, Stevens gave the order [...] "Full ahead both engines. Hard a-starboard," [...] before instructing the destroyer's quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent. Both ships' measures were too late; at 54 seconds from impact, the ships were less than [...] apart and in extremis –physically unable to alter their speed or course enough to avoid a collision.|$|E
6000|$|Finding {{that the}} {{propeller}} would now work, Captain Williamson gave orders for <b>full</b> speed <b>astern.</b> As {{soon as the}} engines started there was more crashing of ice, the small stuff being ground down under the ship, and the ice of the pinnacle breaking off along the shrouds. Everybody on deck {{had to get out}} of the way, for the deck took on the appearance of [...] "an ice-house upset," [...] as Chet put it, big chunks of the frozen material lying in all directions.|$|R
50|$|On 13 June 1917, McCulloch was {{steaming}} with 90 U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy personnel {{on board}} from San Pedro, California, to Mare Island Navy Yard, {{where she was}} to be fitted with larger guns for her wartime Navy service. She was proceeding cautiously in heavy fog about four nautical miles west-northwest of Point Conception, California, at 07:30 when her crew heard the fog signal of the Pacific Steamship Company passenger steamer Governor, which was southbound from San Francisco to San Pedro with 429 passengers and crew aboard. Governor′s crew also heard McCulloch′s fog signal, and Governor′s captain ordered <b>full</b> speed <b>astern</b> and ordered Governor′s whistle to blow three times to indicate that her engines were at <b>full</b> speed <b>astern.</b> McCulloch was off Governor′s port bow when Governor struck her on the starboard side just aft of the pilot house at 07:33, tearing a hole in McCulloch′s hull and seriously injuring one of McCulloch′s crewmen in his bunk. Governor, which suffered no casualties among her passengers and crew, took aboard all of McCulloch′s crew, and McCulloch sank 35 minutes after the collision three nautical miles northwest of Point Conception. Her injured crewman died on 16 June 1917 in a hospital in San Pedro.|$|R
50|$|At 04:14 on the 18th, {{searchlights}} were sighted revealing land 2 {{points on}} the port bow. The Commanding Officer of Pollux had just entered the bridge from the chart house, and immediately gave the order for <b>full</b> speed <b>astern,</b> hard right rudder and sounding collision quarters. But {{it was too late}} and 3 minutes later the ship grounded. Realizing that she was hard aground and starting to go down slightly by the head, the Commanding Officer ordered full speed ahead to prevent the ship from sliding off and sinking in deep water.|$|R
2500|$|Stella {{was built}} for the LSWRs Southampton - Channel Island services. On Maundy Thursday, 30 March 1899, Stella {{departed}} Southampton for St Peter Port, Guernsey carrying 147 passengers and 43 crew. Many of the passengers were travelling to the Channel Islands for an Easter holiday or returning home there during the Easter break. Stella departed Southampton at 11:25 and after passing The Needles proceeded at full speed across the Channel. Some fog banks were encountered and speed was reduced twice while passing through these. Approaching the Channel Islands, another fog bank was encountered, but speed was not reduced. Shortly before 16:00, [...] the fog signal from the Casquets Lighthouse was heard and the Casquets came into view directly ahead. Captain Reeks ordered the engines <b>full</b> <b>astern</b> and attempted {{to turn away from}} the rocks. Stella scraped along two rocks, and then her bottom was ripped open by a submerged granite reef.|$|E
2500|$|The captain {{used the}} navigational method of dead {{reckoning}} to estimate his position {{when he heard}} a whistle of an approaching pilot boat. The pilot came aboard to guide the Letitia through the fog, between the unseen buoys and into the harbour. The pilot continued the course, but he hadn't realized that the captain had incorrectly estimated the ship's position. Ten minutes after the pilot boarded the ship, the captain saw a dark object coming closer and ordered the ship <b>full</b> <b>astern.</b> The order however, came too late and the Letitia was forcefully stopped when she ran aground on Portuguese Cove in Halifax Harbour. Captain McNeil tried to reverse the engines in order to free the ship from her stricken position, but the holds were perforated and the ship was in danger of breaking up, sliding off the shoal and sinking beneath the waves with all of the wounded men still onboard.|$|E
2500|$|The vessels sighted {{each other}} about ten minutes before the {{collision}} and exchanged steam whistle signals. [...] Captain Sawyer of the Superior City and Captain Nelson of the Willis L. King offered conflicting statements about {{the weather and the}} whistle signals prior to the collision. [...] Captain Sawyer said that the weather was clear {{at the time of the}} accident while Captain Nelson said that the night had been foggy and hazy. [...] Captain Sawyer maintained that the two vessels exchanged one blast signals indicating the conventional port-to-port passing signal. [...] Captain Nelson asserted that the vessels exchanged two blast signals for a starboard-to-starboard passing. [...] At the time impact, the Superior City was swinging across the King’s bow while Captain Nelson swung his bow hard aport and rang the telegraph to stop and then <b>full</b> <b>astern.</b> The estimated speed at the time of impact was [...] per hour for the King, and [...] per hour for the Superior City.|$|E
50|$|Shortly thereafter, William Ward Burrows {{proceeded}} to Lunga Roads, off Kukum Point, Guadalcanal, and dropped anchor. She got underway for Tulagi Harbor that afternoon but ran hard aground on the southeast end of Sylvia Reef at 1750, only {{five minutes after}} entering the harbor channel. In {{an effort to get}} out of the predicament, William Ward Burrows rang down <b>full</b> speed <b>astern</b> at 1752 and attempted to use her stern anchor as a kedge; but the ship refused to budge. Little passed a towline to the transport at 1904, but darkness intervened and kept William Ward Burrows aground for the night.|$|R
2500|$|On 23 March 1922, Versatile was {{steaming}} off Europa Point, Gibraltar, at 20 knots {{with other}} destroyers while British submarines practised attacks on them. The submarine [...] surfaced unexpectedly only 30 or 120 yards (27 or 110 meters) – sources differ – ahead of her. Versatile went to <b>full</b> speed <b>astern</b> on her engines {{and put her}} helm over hard to port, but had not yet begun to answer her helm when she rammed H42 abaft the conning tower, almost slicing the submarine in half. H42 sank {{with the loss of}} all hands. An investigation found H42 at fault for surfacing where she did against instructions.|$|R
50|$|Two days later, her master, Capt. Jens G. Olsen, {{received}} the authorization to take George G. Henry south - {{provided that the}} escape be made at night. Thus, at sunset on 15 December, George G. Henry headed for the channel through the minefield that had been sown between Corregidor and the Bataan peninsula. She soon discovered, however, that the channel - supposedly lighted with three buoys - was dark. As she slowed, a strong current carried the tanker inexorably toward the deadly minefield. George G. Henry went <b>full</b> speed <b>astern</b> {{and got out of}} immediate danger but still found herself in a very perilous situation.|$|R
2500|$|A team of divers {{investigated}} Vandal in August 2003, {{looking for}} an explanation for her mysterious sinking. [...] They found a large section (about 4ft) of the stern was missing and the aft engine room escape hatch was closed, but the forward escape hatch was open. [...] In addition, the mooring lines were neatly stowed around both amidships and stern bollards, and the forward hydroplanes were in their stowed position. [...] It is therefore likely that Vandal was on the surface when the incident occurred. [...] The area that Vandal lies in is known as area [...] "Quebec", and was used by submarines performing log calibrations over a [...] "measured mile." [...] So {{it is possible that}} log calibration work was being carried out, and although there are other explanations, this might suggest why she only travelled two miles [...] (4km) in one-and-a-half hours. Maintenance of the log on a submarine can be very hazardous as raising it for inspection can potentially breach the pressure hull and cause a serious flood. In the case of HMS Untamed (which sank three months after Vandal) incorrect procedure whilst carrying out log maintenance was the main contributing factor to the boat and her entire crew being lost. [...] Had the hull been breached, whilst the forward escape hatch was open, the inrush of water could have overwhelmed the submarine. [...] The starboard propeller blades were found to be worn down at their tips, indicating that either the propellers were turning (perhaps <b>full</b> <b>astern)</b> as Vandal hit the seabed, or whilst she was on the seabed in an attempt to drive her off the bottom.|$|E
6000|$|An hour later: [...] "Heard a noise {{similar to}} grounding. Knowing {{this to be}} {{impossible}} in the water in which the boat then was, I came up to 20 feet to investigate, and observed a large mine preceding the periscope {{at a distance of}} about 20 feet, which was apparently hung up by its moorings to the port hydroplane." [...] Hydroplanes are the fins at bow and stern which regulate a submarine's diving. A mine weighs anything from hundredweights to half-tons. Sometimes it explodes if you merely think about it; at others you can batter it like an empty sardine-tin and it submits meekly; but at no time is it meant to wear on a hydroplane. They dared not come up to unhitch it, [...] "owing to the batteries ashore," [...] so they pushed the dim shape ahead of them till they got outside Kum Kale. They then went <b>full</b> <b>astern,</b> and emptied the after-tanks, which brought the bows down, and in this posture rose to the surface, when [...] "the rush of water from the screws together with the sternway gathered allowed the mine to fall clear of the vessel." ...|$|E
5000|$|Fullastern Rock (...) is an {{isolated}} submerged rock {{lying in the}} middle of Johnston Passage 7 nmi km west-northwest of Cape Adriasola, Adelaide Island.

5000|$|On 23 March 1922, H42 was practising torpedo {{attacks against}} British destroyers {{steaming}} off Europa Point, Gibraltar, when she surfaced unexpectedly only 30 or 120 yards (27 or 110 metres) [...] - [...] sources differ [...] - [...] {{ahead of the}} destroyer [...] Versatile, making 20 knots, went to <b>full</b> speed <b>astern</b> on her engines and put her helm over hard to port, but had not yet begun to answer her helm when she rammed H42 abaft the conning tower, almost slicing the submarine in half.

5000|$|Woodbury {{came to rest}} {{alongside}} a small island— later nicknamed [...] "Woodbury Rock"—that she used as a permanent anchor. Volunteers took across four lines and rigged them across the gap of tumbling surf between the destroyer and the rock that would later bear her name. Meanwhile, although water was pouring into the forward boiler room and engine room spaces, Commander Louis P. Davis, the ships commanding officer, ordered <b>full</b> speed <b>astern.</b> Ensign Horatio Ridout, the engineer officer, and his men worked to try to produce the horsepower necessary to get the ship out of her predicament but their efforts were brought to nought when all power failed, due to the flooding, at 2230.|$|R
25|$|While {{navigating}} the Elbe about eight miles above Brunsbuttel {{she was given}} permission to proceed until Cuxhaven {{at the mouth of}} the North Sea. There was no pilot ship available to take her through the minefield at Cuxhaven so she attempted to proceed on her own along the usual channel. Tugboat men of the harbour tried to warn San Wilfridos master about the danger by shouting. The master then tried to evade the mines by attempting to go <b>full</b> speed <b>astern.</b> However, at approximately four p.m., a strong ebb tide carried San Wilfrido into the mines. Three explosions followed and crippled the ship making it the first British naval loss of the war. A German tug took the crew away and made them prisoners.|$|R
50|$|With {{electrical}} power lost, all 4 hydraulic pumps stopped. With no hydraulic pressure, hydrodynamic {{forces on the}} propellers caused the pitch to reverse. This made the boat run <b>full</b> <b>astern.</b> The rearward motion of the boat drove the sinking aft section further under water. It also exacerbated water entry into the air intake vents on the trawl deck.|$|E
5000|$|Jones {{first made}} several {{attempts}} {{to back the}} ship off the rocks, running the engines at <b>full</b> <b>astern,</b> to no avail.

50|$|Trials were {{conducted}} in Whitefish Bay, Lake Superior, Michigan which determined that the ship has a tactical diameter of approximately three ship lengths when using 30 degrees rudder and that the ship could stop in 40 seconds with a reach of four ship lengths from an approach speed of 12.8 kn when ordering <b>full</b> <b>astern</b> power. The ship can obtain a speed of 14.7 kn.|$|E
50|$|From Wellington to Cape Campbell {{the wind}} was a strong north westerly. At 3pm the wind swung round {{suddenly}} to a very strong south-easterly with heavy rain and fog. The captain was on deck until 6.30pm. At about 7pm the mate advised the Captain {{that he could see}} land on the port bow. The captain returned to the bridge stopping the vessel and then going <b>full</b> speed <b>astern.</b> At about 7:30pm she grounded 50 yards from shore half a mile north of Waipapa Point near the Clarence River mouth. She was traveling at about 8-10 knots at the time. The weather was still bad with driving rain and rough seas. The outline of the hills by the coast were just visible in the dark.|$|R

Captain Pruss ordered aft engines <b>full</b> <b>astern</b> at 7:14 while at an {{altitude}} of 394 ft, to try to brake the airship.|$|E
50|$|The {{captain of}} Alaska Ranger {{died in the}} sinking so it is unknown why he did not stop the diesel engines. The Coast Guard had tested the engine {{emergency}} shutoff system {{a year before the}} sinking and reported that it functioned properly.

This meant that 25 crew members that had jumped into the water never got to one of the three lifeboats.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after this, the Chief Officer and lookout both {{reported}} a white line close ahead; waves breaking {{over the edge}} of the reef. The ship was ordered to swing hard to port, but did not swing far enough to clear the southern edge of the reef, running aground 5.7 nmi km from the tower. The engines were stopped, and at 1736 were put <b>full</b> <b>astern</b> in an attempt to pull the ship off the reef. After almost two hours, the failed attempts ceased.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the {{buildings}} currently on the waterfront date from after 1922, but there are someexceptions. The lighthouse was built in 1919.
