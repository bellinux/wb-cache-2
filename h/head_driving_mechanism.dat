40|$|The {{importance}} of {{the form of the}} <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> in MHD simulations of coronal mass ejections is investigated. A model simulation problem is devised, and it is found that the use of a simple form for the initial corona, with an upward moving parcel of cold, dense plasma as the <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism,</b> can produce results that are consistent with many of the features observed by coronagraphs. The results imply that the nature of the <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> may {{play an important role in}} determining the dynamical evolution of mass ejections...|$|R

The first simulation effort, using a simple model of a plasmoid as the <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> and a simple model of the initial corona, produces results that are also consistent with many observational features, suggesting that the nature of the <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{plays an important role in}} determining the subsequent evolution of mass ejections.

40|$|A wheel-propeller-leg {{integrated}} amphibious robot {{is presented}} as a new type of robot, which can both crawl on land and swim underwater in certain depth or creep on ocean floor. The multi-locomotion models and compound-mobile mechanism are the main traits of the amphibious robot.

50|$|For {{technological}} applications, it {{is highly}} desirable to combine ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order within one material, but {{it has become clear}} that usual displacive ferroelectric order, e.g. like in BaTiO3, cannot coexist together with magnetic order. Whereas the latter requires at least partially filled d-shells (e.g.-orbitals) providing a non-zero magnetic moment, usual displacive ferroelectricity requires empty d-shells. Therefore, new ferroelectric <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms</b> must be present for electric and magnetic ferroic order to occur simultaneously. A variety of <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> is described below.|$|R

The variation in the Earth's rotation can be separated into the length-of-day (LOD) variation and the polar motion. Possible <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms</b> include: atmospheric/oceanic circulations, seismic activities, solar-lunar tides, mantle convection, core-mantle coupling, and solar activities.

40|$|The North Atlantic {{is a key}} {{region for}} global climate variability. Earlier studies have shown changes in the {{large-scale}} circulation, air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes and the carbon cycle in the North Atlantic in relation to anthropogenic forcing, but changes attributed to natural variability are less certain. However, in order to fully comprehend the ocean carbon sink and its variability, both, anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms</b> need to be evaluated. The results of this thesis are presented in four papers. In the first paper, the impact of atmospheric forcing on convection in the subpolar North Atlantic, in particular with regard to ocean ventilation and carbon sequestration is presented based on a unique dataset collected during a winter cruise to the Irminger Sea. In the second paper, a long term perspective on inorganic carbon inventory changes and its natural and an- thropogenic components is given. Inventory changes were decomposed into their main <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and related to the evolution and distribution of the main water masses in the Irminger Sea. The third paper discusses surface f CO 2 and pH trends across the Irminger Sea and Iceland Basin and their main <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The North Atlantic shows large decadal freshening and cooling signal, which produce a large non-anthropogenic <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> on surface ocean f CO 2 trends. The fourth paper discusses pH changes in the interior Irminger Sea and the Iceland Basin {{as well as the}} <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the observed variability. Combined, the four papers in this thesis increase our understanding of fundamen- tal interactions between atmospheric, hydrographic and biogeochemical processes in the subpolar North Atlantic. In particular, trends associated to natural variability and an- thropogenic climate change are distinguished, which contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the variability of carbon cycle processes in the modern ocean. </p...|$|R
