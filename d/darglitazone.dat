40|$|Diabetes is an {{increased}} risk factor for stroke and results in increased brain damage in experimental animals and humans. The precise mechanisms are unclear, but our earlier studies in the db/db mice suggested that the cerebral inflammatory response initiating recovery was both delayed and diminished in the diabetic mice compared with the nondiabetic db/+ mice. In this study, we investigated {{the actions of the}} peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -γ agonist <b>darglitazone</b> in treating diabetes and promoting recovery after a hypoxic-ischemic (H/I) insult in the diabetic ob/ob mouse. Male ob/+ and ob/ob mice received <b>darglitazone</b> (1 [*]mg/kg) for 7 days before induction of H/I. <b>Darglitazone</b> restored euglycemia and normalized elevated corticosterone, triglycerides, and very-low-density lipoprotein levels. <b>Darglitazone</b> dramatically reduced the infarct size in the ob/ob mice at 24 [*]h of recovery compared with the untreated group (30 ± 13 % to 3. 3 ± 1. 6 %, n= 6 to 8) but did not show any significant effect in the ob/+ mice. Microglial and astrocytic activation monitored by cytokine expression (interleukin- 1 β and tumor necrosis factor-α) and in situ hybridization studies (bfl 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein) suggest a biphasic inflammatory response, with <b>darglitazone</b> restoring the compromised proinflammatory response(s) in the diabetic mouse at 4 [*]h but suppressing subsequent inflammatory responses at 8 and 24 [*]h in both control and diabetic mice...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the thiazolidinediones (TZDs) <b>darglitazone</b> and {{troglitazone}} on 3 -adrenergic receptor (AR) expression was studied in cultured cell lines repre-senting several tissues. After 24 h of exposing HIB- 1 B brown adipocytes to 30 µmol/l <b>darglitazone</b> or 20 µmol/l troglitazone, 3 -AR mRNA levels were reduced by 75 %. This effect was significant within 1 h of exposure to a maximal dose of these drugs, with the full effect obtained within 10 h. The <b>darglitazone</b> ID 50 was ~ 10 nmol/l, similar to the Kd of TZDs binding to perox-isome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR-). These drugs also decreased 3 -AR mRNA in 3 T 3 -F 442 A white adipocytes, but not in SK-N-MC cells, which lack PPAR- 2. A luciferase reporter gene containing 1. 4 kb of 5 flanking sequence of the mouse 3 -AR was tran...|$|E
40|$|Thiazolidinediones {{represent}} an established class of insulin sensitizing agents for treating noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. <b>Darglitazone,</b> a thiazolidinedione approximately 200 more potent than ciglitazone, was evaluated in preclinical safety assessment studies using rats (1, 5, and 50 mg/kg/day) and cynomolgus monkeys (50, 75, and 100 mg/kg/day). Dar-glitazone was a potent adipogenic agent in rats, causing hy-perplastic/hypertrophic changes and firmness {{of white and}} perirenal, dorsal thoracic (TBAT), and interscapular brown ad-ipose tissue (BAT). Progressive changes in BAT size, morphol-ogy, firmness, and fatty acid composition preceded clinical signs of impaired respiration and the subsequent development of a dose-dependent, life-threatening hydrothorax. The char-acteristics of the pleural effusate were consistent with lym...|$|E
40|$|AbstractExpression of {{the gene}} {{encoding}} resistin, a low molecular weight protein secreted from adipose tissue postulated to link obesity and type II diabetes, was examined in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Resistin mRNA was detected in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells by day 3 following induction of differentiation into adipocytes; by day 4 the level of resistin mRNA peaked and remained high. The PPARγ activators, rosiglitazone or <b>darglitazone,</b> reduced the level of resistin mRNA. Dexamethasone upregulated resistin mRNA level, but no effect was observed with the β 3 -adrenoceptor agonist, BRL 37344. A substantial reduction in resistin mRNA level was observed with insulin, which induced decreases at physiological concentrations. Insulin may be a major inhibitor of resistin production, and this does not support a role for resistin in insulin resistance...|$|E
40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{increases the}} risk for cardiovascular disease three- to fourfold. Because of the rise in diabetes prevalence {{there is a need}} for a better understanding of the link between diabetes and atherosclerosis. This thesis deals with the monocyte/macrophage s property as a scavenger of modified low density lipoprotein (LDL) and abnormalities related to this property that may be of importance in the association between type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. The specific aims were to investigate 1) the regulation of scavenger receptor A by antioxidants, 2) the regulation of scavenger receptor CD 36 by fatty acids and the thiazolidinedione <b>darglitazone,</b> and 3) if diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance is associated with abnormalities in the expression of monocytic receptors that are involved in atherogenesis. 	 Scavenger receptor A was found to be down-regulated by the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and a-tocopherol. The effect of incubation with N-acetylcysteine was the same in freshly isolated human monocytes, serum-differentiated macrophages and macrophages derived from atherosclerotic lesions. Thus it seems that the regulation of this gene is similar in macrophages in culture and in macrophages in atherosclerosis. In order to mimic the situation in type 2 diabetes human macrophages were incubated with free fatty acids. Fatty acids increased the expression of scavenger receptor CD 36. This may lead to enhanced foam cell formation in diabetes. <b>Darglitazone</b> also up-regulated CD 36, however it did not have this effect in the presence of fatty acids. In a population-based study 64 -year old women with type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance and normal glucose tolerance were examined regarding the expression of monocytic surface receptors. Women with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance had elevated expression of the Fcg-receptor CD 64 and the common b 2 -integrin subunit CD 18 on their monocytes and elevated circulating levels of oxidized LDL compared with women with normal glucose tolerance. Women with diabetes also had higher monocytic expression of CD 14 and signs of a systemic inflammation, e. g. elevated levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin- 6 and soluble adhesion molecules. The changes in monocytic receptor expression may confer increased propensity for activation and adhesion to the arterial wall and an increased uptake of LDL in immune complexes, leading to accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes. In conclusion type 2 diabetes or metabolic disturbances associated with this disease can influence monocyte/macrophages in several ways, which may lead to accelerated atherosclerosis. Abnormalities in these cells may constitute a link between type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis...|$|E
