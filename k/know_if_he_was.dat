5|$|On the May 24 {{episode of}} Raw, Bischoff lifted Michaels' suspension, after Triple H pleaded that Michaels be reinstated. On the same night, Michaels confronted Bischoff wanting to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{scheduled}} in a match with Triple H at Bad Blood. Bischoff assured Michaels, but Triple H attacked Michaels from behind, after Michaels attacked Triple H outside the arena's parking lot. Bischoff gave orders to Raw superstars to attack Triple H and Michaels, if seen fighting. The roster tried breaking the fight up, but were unsuccessful in doing so. The {{result of the}} fight gave Bischoff the authority to schedule a Hell in a Cell match between Triple H and Michaels at Bad Blood. At Bad Blood, Triple H defeated Michaels by pinfall after executing two Pedigrees.|$|E
25|$|Around noon on July 23, 1968, a {{call was}} made to the Cleveland Police {{reporting}} an abandoned vehicle on Beulah Avenue between E. 123rd Street and Lakeview Road. The location was just a block north of Evans' home (at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview). The vehicle was ticketed at 1:25 PM, but a tow truck did not arrive until dusk. It parked {{on the north side}} of Beulah Avenue near the intersection with Lakeview Road. According to tow truck worker William McMillan, the truck backed up to the abandoned car, and then McMillan got out. He was checking the license plate of the automobile a few moments later when a man with a shotgun standing at the corner of Beulah and Auburndale shot him in the back. An official chronology later placed the attack on McMillan at 8:25 PM. Another man hiding in the bushes near the front of the truck fired, and shot McMillan in the side. McMillan's coworker, still in the truck, radioed for help at 8:28 PM. According to McMillan, Ahmed Evans—armed with a carbine—walked on the sidewalk across the street and demanded to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> stealing cars. McMillan stood and said he had no weapons. He ran toward and then north up E. 123rd Street, and Evans shot him in the right side. An African American woman on E. 123rd Street gave refuge to McMillan.|$|E

500|$|The {{moment that}} Cupid and Psyche are {{revealed}} {{is an example}} of [...] "Keatsian intensity" [...] as they are neither in a state of separation nor are they united; they exist in a state somewhere in between in a similar manner to the figures depicted in Keats's [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". The narrator's ability to witness the union is unique to Keats's version of the Psyche myth because the lovers in the original story were covered in darkness. However, the narrator questions if he was able to see them at all or if he was dreaming. This inability of the narrator to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> awake is a theme that appears in many of Keats's odes that followed, including [...] "Ode on Indolence", [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Regardless of the narrator's state of consciousness, he is able to relate himself to Cupid as he believes himself to be in love with Psyche, representing the mind.|$|E
2500|$|Once Zhuangzi dreamt {{he was a}} {{butterfly}}, {{a butterfly}} flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know he was Zhuangzi.

But he didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Zhuangzi who had dreamt he was a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi. Between Zhuangzi and a butterfly {{there must be some}} distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things. (2, tr. Burton Watson 1968:49) ...|$|E
2500|$|The match {{finished}} {{level and}} with both teams tiring, extra time contained less incident. Two minutes {{prior to the}} end of extra time, Everton substitute Brooke Chaplen passed the ball through the Arsenal defence to Natasha Dowie who broke into the right hand side of the penalty area. After beating the onrushing goalkeeper Emma Byrne in a race to the ball, Dowie knocked the ball into the net from an acute angle for her 28th goal of the season. Elated, Dowie ran into the crowd and hugged a random little boy: [...] "I don't even <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a supporter," [...] she later told reporters.|$|E

2500|$|World War I {{brought a}} crisis in his development. Military service {{disrupted}} his life when {{at the age of}} 42 he was in the army.

2500|$|Hawaii {{has had a}} {{long history}} of queer identities. Māhū people, who often traversed gender as defined by Western standards, were a {{respected}} group of pre-colonization people who were widely known in society as healers. Another Hawaiian word, aikāne, referred to same-sex relationships. According to journals written by Captain Cook's crew, it is widely believed that many alii engaged in aikāne relationships. Hawaiian scholar Lilikalā Kameeleihiwa said, [...] "If you didn't sleep with a man, how could you trust him when you went into battle?

He decorated his flat in a style that {{was similar to the}} way he dressed, with Star Trek-themed wallpaper, mirrors and a large piano. He was a ringleader of misbehavior, and with his club, he created a place where there were no rules. At the peak of his fame in the clubs he would distort his body in various ways, so that he would appear deformed, or pregnant or with breasts.

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1982, Riddle was {{approached}} by Linda Ronstadt— via telephone through her manager and producer, Peter Asher— to write arrangements for an album of jazz standards that Linda had been contemplating since her stint in The Pirates of Penzance. The agreement between the two resulted in a three-album contract which included what were {{to be the last}} arrangements of Riddle's career, with the exception of an album of twelve Great American Songbook standards he arranged and conducted for his old friend, opera singer Kiri Te Kanawa, in April 1985, six months before his death that October. Ronstadt recalls that when she initially approached Riddle, she did not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> even familiar with her music. He knew her name, but basically hated rock 'n' roll. [...] However, his daughter was a big Linda Ronstadt fan and told her father, [...] "Don't worry, Dad. Her checks won't bounce." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon {{attended}} a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston.

Shannon later commented: [...] "I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: it was like, when I {{walked in the door}} and I heard them playing, it was like a revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E

Kurt Busch composed himself after the race, but called out Logano for his actions. An aghast Busch said in a post-race interview, [...] "Joey just drove straight through us.

He is in a prodigious hurry to be at Dunkirk before Saturday. I wish to God he maybe soon wanted. He is in such haste that I was forced to go halves with him in hiring a packet boat at the rate of £5 on purpose to be almost “drounded,” or what was very near as extravagant a reason, to humour my fellow traveller, for we came over in so prodigious a storm that nothing but our light heads could have kept us from the bottom." ...|$|E

Portis said that if Vick is charged and convicted of dog fighting, [...] "then you're putting him behind bars for no reason. I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> fighting dogs or not, but it's his property. It's his dog. If that's {{what he wants to}} do, do it."

2500|$|Taking {{his seat}} in the House of Lords, Fitzwilliam {{attended}} almost every notable debate, signing nearly every protest which the opposition used but never made a speech during Lord North's premiership. He supported John Wilkes in his fight to keep the seat {{he was elected to}} and supported the American Colonies in their dispute with Britain. On 8 July 1776 he asked Lord Rockingham to arrange for a remonstrance to be sent to the King when war broke out in America, so the Americans would see [...] "that there is still in the country a body of men of the first rank and importance, who would still wish to govern them according to the old policy". George Selwyn MP recorded that on 6 March 1782 he had been confronted by Fitzwilliam at the Brooks's and had to listen to Fitzwilliam on the dire state of the nation: [...] "I do not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in earnest, but I suppose that he was. He had worked himself up to commiserate the state of the country, nay, that of the king himself, [...] that I expected every instant that his heart would have burst". When Selwyn asked Fitzwilliam [...] "if there was a possibility of salvation in any position in which our affairs could be placed", Fitzwilliam [...] "asked me...with the utmost impetuosity, what objection I had to Lord Rock being sent for.

2500|$|Although it is {{not known}} {{precisely}} by whom gunpowder was invented, most historians agree that gunpowder's origins were in China by virtue of archaeological evidence and historical documents predating others by centuries, even if some professional military historians know little or nothing else about this early history of gunpowder warfare. The very earliest possible reference to gunpowder appeared in 142 AD during the Eastern Han dynasty, when the alchemist Wei Boyang wrote about a substance with the properties of gunpowder, and described a mixture of three powders that would [...] "fly and dance" [...] violently in his Cantong qi, otherwise known as the Book of the Kinship of Three, a Taoist text on the subject of alchemy. Although it is impossible to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> actually referring to gunpowder, no other explosive known to scientists is composed of three powders. While it was almost certainly not their intention to create a weapon of war, Taoist alchemists would continue {{to play a major role}} in the invention of gunpowder due to their experiments on sulfur and saltpeter in the search for the secrets of eternal life and ways to transmute one material into another. Historian Peter Lorge notes that despite the early association of gunpowder with Taoism, this may be a quirk of historiography, and a result of the better preservation of texts associated with Taoism rather than being a point of interest limited to only Taoists. The Taoist quest for the elixir of life attracted many powerful patrons, one of whom was Emperor Wu of Han, and one of the resulting alchemical experiments involved heating 10% sulfur and 75% saltpeter to transform them.|$|E
