Henneman {{impressed}} Uncle Tupelo, and {{he was invited to}} be a guitar technician and occasional multi-instrumentalist for the band. While Farrar and Heidorn would avoid <b>drinking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> after shows, Tweedy would continue drinking throughout the night. Although Tweedy stopped after he began dating Sue Miller in 1991, a significant communication gap had already been opened between Tweedy and Farrar.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{attempts}} to make everyone's Christmas wishes come true. At a conference meeting, he vows to keep his promise to make wishes and asks the office members to also be nice to his new girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). An emotionally confused Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries {{to be nice to}} Jessica, but ends up <b>drinking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> at the party. In a drunken stupor, she tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Offended, he tells her to get over their breakup before storming off. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part as a friend of Erin's by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not least because Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage is ending, spends {{a good deal of the}} party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words of encouragement. Andy subsequently drives away with a smile on his face.|$|E
25|$|The single brethren's {{house was}} not a success financially. The young men were {{frequently}} admonished for <b>drinking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> at the settlement's inn; on one occasion, they had some fun at a fire drill by turning the hosepipe on a Br Gilpin who took offence.|$|E
50|$|A former {{actor who}} portrayed Tony Stark on an unnamed show, Henry Hellrung enjoyed an {{extremely}} successful career and friendship with Stark until heavy drinking {{led to his}} downfall.

Describing his inspiration, he stated [...] "Let's just say I was pretty depressed. I was totally unmotivated, <b>drinking</b> way <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> smoking way <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> and the ladies weren't exactly banging down my door. But, somehow the song is pretty fun to play." [...] Though {{infrequently}} performed as a group, Andriano occasionally plays the song solo at the band's shows.|$|R
50|$|O'Neil {{asks for}} a rematch, this time a {{drinking}} contest. Despite his ulcer, Valentino accepts. Although Valentino defeats O'Neil again, his excessive <b>drinking</b> is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for the ulcer, which perforates when he returns to his home that night. He dies crawling on the floor unable to reach an orange he had drunkenly played with and dropped on the floor (representing his failed dream of growing an orange grove) The film ends with a shot of Valentino's body on a slab in a mortuary as the credits roll.|$|R
25|$|Sebastian Stoskopff died in 1657 {{at the age}} of 60 in {{a public}} house in Idstein. He was {{reportedly}} supposed to have died because of <b>drinking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> alcohol. Nearly 20 years later, Stoskopff's murder became clear during an indictment for witchcraft, in which the owner of the public house and a woman were involved.

25|$|In September 1928, Henry left England {{with his}} brother Edward, Prince of Wales, to shoot big game in Africa. The {{brothers}} parted in Nairobi, where Henry was {{to stay for a}} while. There, he was entertained by Mansfield Markham and his wife Beryl Markham. Beryl and Henry soon started an affair (though sources differ over when the affair started; many say it was not until her visit to England). In November, the brothers were recalled to England due to their father’s worsening health, and soon after Beryl returned too. At the Grosvenor Hotel, close to Buckingham Palace, the affair continued with Prince Henry openly hosting parties with her in her suite and <b>drinking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1870, Crazy Horse invited Black Buffalo Woman to {{accompany}} him on a buffalo hunt in the Slim Buttes area of present-day northwestern South Dakota. She was the wife of No Water, who {{had a reputation for}} <b>drinking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> It was Lakota custom to allow a woman to divorce her husband at any time. She did so by moving in with relatives or with another man, or by placing the husband's belongings outside their lodge. Although some compensation might be required to smooth over hurt feelings, the rejected husband was expected to accept his wife's decision. No Water was away from camp when Crazy Horse and Black Buffalo Woman left for the buffalo hunt.|$|E
50|$|The tour {{included}} many controversies, some leading to Hagar's permanent departure following the tour. Michael Anthony, longtime bassist {{for the band}} (performing with them until 2000 when they went on hiatus, but still officially {{a member of the}} band in 2004) was hired as a touring musician but not a 'real' band member, being paid a reduced commission. Initially the Van Halen brothers didn't want him on the tour at all, but Hagar flatly refused to tour without Anthony. Hagar also accused Eddie Van Halen of <b>drinking</b> far <b>too</b> <b>much</b> on the tour, despite Eddie's denials.|$|R

One could meet friends here, known and unknown artists, confident Zadkine with a dog, Fougita with his strange hairstyle and his ugly friend, bulky Isidora Duncan, Shanna Orlow, Kisling, crazy Americans and drunken Swedes, Indians, Swiss, Russians... Montparnasse looked like a modern Babylon. His life and youth were abundantly satisfied." ...|$|R

My head ached. The sun- glare on the water made my eyes ache, while I was {{suffering}} {{more than half a}} touch of mal de mer from the antic conduct of the outrigger on the blobby sea. The air was stagnant. In the lee of Waihee, between the white beach and the roof, no whisper of breeze eased the still sultriness.

25|$|The {{causes of}} {{hyponatremia}} are typically classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume. Low volume hyponatremia can occur from diarrhea, vomiting, diuretics, and sweating. Normal volume hyponatremia {{is divided into}} cases with dilute urine and concentrated urine. Cases in which the urine is dilute include adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and <b>drinking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> water or too much beer. Cases in which the urine is concentrated include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). High volume hyponatremia can occur from heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure. Conditions {{that can lead to}} falsely low sodium measurements include high blood protein levels such as in multiple myeloma, high blood fat levels, and high blood sugar.|$|E
25|$|The EFSA panel also {{determined}} intakes for different populations. Recommended intake volumes {{in the elderly}} {{are the same as}} for adults as despite lower energy consumption, the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity. Pregnant and breastfeeding women require additional fluids to stay hydrated. The EFSA panel proposes that pregnant women should consume the same volume of water as non-pregnant women, plus an increase in proportion to the higher energy requirement, equal to 300 mL/day. To compensate for additional fluid output, breastfeeding women require an additional 700 mL/day above the recommended intake values for non-lactating women. Dehydration and over-hydration - too little and too much water, respectively - can have harmful consequences. <b>Drinking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> water is one of the possible causes of hyponatremia, i.e., low serum sodium.|$|E

With Long Hill lost, Fanny and Welsh separated, Fanny taking a job as a live-in housekeeper at the St Paul's Hotel on 60th Street, New York, a venue where she and Welsh once lived in a suite of apartments. Soon after, Welsh's health began to deteriorate and he began complaining of severe chest pains. His doctor reported that Welsh was depressed and was <b>drinking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> On 17 July 1927 Welsh appeared at the West Side Court in New York City, sporting a black-eye suffered in a street brawl. He faced a charge of disorderly conduct, after he came off worse in a drunken encounter with Edward Delaney of New York. The patrolman who saved Welsh from a serious beating assured the magistrate that it was a friendly fight and the charges were dismissed against both men.|$|E

500|$|In KoLs turn-based gameplay, a player's {{character}} is supplied {{with a number}} of adventures each day, at a base of 40, although this can be increased. The game day resets at a time called [...] "rollover". [...] Characters are allotted forty adventures every rollover, though they can increase that number with various equipment and items. Additional adventures can be acquired by consuming food and booze. However, only a limited amount of each can be consumed each day, and <b>drinking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> booze puts the character into a drunken stupor {{for the remainder of the}} day. During rollover, drunkenness and fullness levels are reset, and minor amounts of health points and magic points are restored. Although a character can accumulate a large number of adventures, the number is reduced to 200 at rollover.|$|E

40|$|A study {{examined}} the types and amounts of information expectant mothers need during their pregnancy, {{as well as their}} satisfaction with their physicians. Seventy women who had given birth within the previous 4 years completed a questionnaire eliciting information they received during pregnancy, their satisfaction with their physician, and demographic data. The results indicated that while expectant mothers did receive {{a great deal of information}} from their obstetricians, they needed more information about what to expect during labor and delivery, as well as more information about breast feeding. Subjects indicated that they received <b>too</b> <b>much</b> information about the hazards of smoking and <b>drinking,</b> and <b>too</b> <b>much</b> printed information.

500|$|Throughout the game, players {{encounter}} {{both human}} enemies, such as gang members, FizzCo's robots, OD'd humans who have mutated from <b>drinking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{of the energy}} drink, and several bosses who {{are more difficult to}} defeat compared with other ordinary enemies. The game features a variety of weapons for players to use to combat enemies. These include the standard assault rifle AK-FU and the TNTeddy grenade launcher, which fires teddy bears strapped to sticks of dynamite, fireworks and toy helicopters. All weapons eventually run out of ammunition but {{do not need to be}} reloaded while being used. Players unlock more weapons by progressing through the story or purchasing them from shops. Weapons can be upgraded and modified by applying [...] "Amps", which increases weapons' lethality, efficiency, and strength.

After they left the town, almost all of their land was sold for taxes. Mary Jo Wright died around 1931; John developed a problem with alcohol. He was ostracized and taunted for assisting the survivors, and rumored to keep a gun in every room of his house. He died after <b>drinking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> one night in Cedar Key, and was buried in an unmarked grave in Sumner.

30|$|The {{sulfate ion}} causes no {{particular}} harmful effects on soils or plants; however, {{it contributes to}} increase the salinity in the soil solution. SO 4 ranges from 1.13 to 94.05  mg/l in pre-monsoon and 0.00 – 99.03  mg/l in post-monsoon. Acceptable limit of sulfate in drinking water is 200  mg/l (400  mg/l in case of no other alternative source) (BIS 2012). Excess sulfate consumption through water might lead to occurrence of diarrhea in humans. Cl ranges from 15.0 to 184.94  mg/l in pre-monsoon and 15.0 – 459.86  mg/l in post-monsoon. WHO has set standards of 200 – 500  mg/l for chloride in <b>drinking</b> water. <b>Too</b> <b>much</b> of chloride leads to bad taste in water and also chloride ion combines with the Na (that is being derived from the weathering of granitic terrains) and forms NaCl, whose excess presence in water makes it saline and unfit for drinking and irrigation purposes.
