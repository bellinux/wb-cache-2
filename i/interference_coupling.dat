A new framework based on multi-pattern formulation has been proposed in this paper to study the energy efficient strategy for joint cell activation, user association and multicell multiuser channel allocation. One key feature of this interference pattern formulation is that the patterns remain fixed and independent of the optimization process. This creates a favorable opportunity for a linear programming formulation while still taking <b>interference</b> <b>coupling</b> into account. A tailored algorithm is developed to solve the formulated network energy saving problem in the dual domain by exploiting the problem structure, which gives a significant complexity saving compared to using standard solvers.

Press-fitting the hollow SMA shaft in its detwinned martensitic phase into a steel hub creates a joint capable of holding parts such as emergency doors, satellite solar panels, or tamper locks securely together until commanded release. Release is accomplished by heating the SMA to its activation temperature. The resulting decrease in diameter of the hollow SMA shaft allows it to easily slip out of the hub, releasing the part.

40|$|Spectrum sharing {{mechanisms}} need to {{be carefully}} designed to enable inter-technology coexistence in the unlicensed bands, as these bands are an instance of a spectrum commons where heterogeneous technologies and deployments must coexist. Unlike in licensed bands, where multiple technologies could coexist only in a primary-secondary DSA mode, a spectrum commons offers competition opportunities between multiple dominant technologies, such as Wi-Fi and the recently proposed LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed band. In this paper we systematically study the performance of different spectrum sharing schemes for inter-technology coexistence in a spectrum commons. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a general framework for comparative analysis of spectrum sharing mechanisms in time and frequency, by studying the effect of key constituent parameters. Second, we propose a novel throughput and interference model for inter-technology coexistence, integrating different distributed MAC sharing mechanisms {{at the same level}} of abstraction. Finally, we present a case study of IEEE 802. 11 n Wi-Fi and LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed band, in order to obtain generalizable insight into coexistence in a spectrum commons. Our extensive simulation results show that LTE/Wi-Fi coexistence in the 5 GHz band can be ensured simply through channel selection schemes, such that time-sharing MAC mechanisms are irrelevant. We also show that, in the general co-channel case, the coexistence performance of MAC sharing mechanisms strongly depends on the <b>interference</b> <b>coupling</b> in the network, as determined by building shielding. We thus identify two regimes: (i) low <b>interference</b> <b>coupling,</b> e. g. residential indoor scenarios, where duty cycle mechanisms outperform sensing-based LBT mechanisms; and (ii) high <b>interference</b> <b>coupling,</b> e. g. open-plan indoor or outdoor hotspot scenarios, where LBT outperforms duty cycle mechanisms.

We introduce the certain {{desirable and}} natural properties of resource allocation strategies, namely (strong) intuitive fairness and non-participation. We prove {{that there are certain}} inconsistencies, among the properties of strategy proofness, efficiency, (strong) intuitive fairness, non-participation, and continuity. These inconsistencies result in certain limitations while having algorithmic implementations and certain analytical investigations of these resource allocation strategies. Hence, it can be observed that non-manipulation and Pareto optimality of the resource allocation strategies are stringent requirements and along with certain other desirable properties is not always implementable. It has been shown that the only permissible SCF representing a resource allocation strategy in <b>interference</b> <b>coupled</b> wireless systems, which can be implemented in either Nash equilibrium or dominant strategy is the trivial constant function.|$|R

In this case there exists a unique optimizer for the problem of maximizing the product of utilities.

This model holds for a large class of practically relevant system designs (e. g., beamforming, CDMA). In general, <b>interference</b> <b>coupling</b> is strongly influenced by the receive strategy. Thus, classical results based on the assumption of fixed irreducible coupling matrices cannot be transferred directly.
