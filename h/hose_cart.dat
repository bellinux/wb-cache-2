2500|$|The San Rafael Fire Department {{was first}} {{organized}} on December 5, 1874 when William Miller and J.B. Rice posted a {{notice in the}} Marin County Journal, calling for volunteer firemen. [...] The organisation was first named the [...] "San Rafael Hose Company Number One" [...] but was then renamed the [...] "San Rafael Hose, Hook and Ladder Company" [...] to show the range of their equipment. [...] There were 45 volunteers {{from a variety of}} trades including a justice of the peace and a school superintendent and were led by sheriff James Tunstede. [...] Their first major appliance was a <b>hose</b> <b>cart</b> which was pulled by hand to a hydrant. [...] The water supply of San Rafael used gravity to provide pressure and so a pump was not required. [...] By the 1890s, the Company had 90 volunteer members, two hand pulled hose carts, two hose carriages and one hook and ladder wagon that was pulled by a rented team of horses when needed.|$|E

A knitting mill made socks and once produced 85,000 pairs of socks for the Army and Navy.|$|R
50|$|On August 7, 1896 a mass {{meeting of}} the {{citizens}} of Washington was held at the town hall to devise ways and means toward purchasing fire equipment and forming an organized fire brigade. From that meeting the first organized fire department was founded. Records from 1898 show that the town of Washington had a volunteer fire department with a fire chief and 33 members. Apparatus listed for the department at that time consisted of two hand <b>hose</b> <b>carts</b> with 350 ft. of 2 ½ in. cotton rubber lined hose on each, One 50 gal hand chemical cart, and One hand hook & ladder cart. All of the apparatus was located at the town hall.|$|R

A roster of 1,500 firemen, 55 engines, 6 ladder companies and 5 <b>hose</b> <b>carts</b> were deemed insufficient to protect the city. Throughout the summer and fall of 1835, the department had fought numerous fires. On December 14, the entire fire department had spent the freezing, miserable evening fighting two large fires, which destroyed thirteen buildings and two shops. The city's fire cisterns were nearly empty and its firefighting force exhausted when disaster struck.|$|R
25|$|On May 3, 1880, the City’s {{board of}} {{trustees}} (now city council) passed an ordinance to organize the first fire department, which was originally a hook and ladder company. The ordinance also authorized the digging of a well in the public square, and the department soon acquired a horse-drawn ladder truck for $1,600. The foreman of the Hook & Ladder Company requested the city council provide additional equipment in January 1894. Items requested included lanterns, a heavy iron hook, and axes with hooks on the pole, which was {{to add to the}} existing equipment that included the ladder truck and several <b>hose</b> <b>carts.</b> The city purchased a hand engine from Albany, Oregon, in 1890 for $400.

50|$|Many {{changes have}} come about through the years: {{concrete}} sidewalks replaced those made of wood. The dirt and stone road to Lewiston became a safe paved highway; the fire company grew from a man-pulled <b>hose</b> <b>cart</b> into a fully equipped fire department {{and water and}} sewer systems were installed throughout the village.

50|$|The {{need for}} a fire {{department}} on the UC Davis campus was first raised {{when it was still}} the Berkeley Farm by the Dean of the College of Agriculture in 1917 when several hand-drawn <b>hose</b> <b>carts</b> were purchased and placed in sheds throughout the farm. Initially, this fire service was completely volunteer with students and professors assigned to each cart. Whenever a fire broke out, a whistle would sound to summon the firefighting volunteers. In 1937, the University created an organized fire protection service with its first career firefighters on the campus. In 1949, the role of students became formalized when the University began its Student Firefighter Program which was designed to teach firefighting skills to a select students. The program allowed students to receive hands-on training and professional experience in all aspects of fire and emergency services.|$|R
5000|$|After several serious {{fires in}} 1890, {{with the loss}} of life of six firefighters in {{addition}} to loss of property, the Fire Brigades Act 1890 was passed with the aim of uniting these rival fire brigades. The first meeting of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade (MFB) board took place on 6 March 1891, and led to the disbanding of the then 56 volunteer brigades in Melbourne on 30 April 1891 with an invitation to firefighters to join the new organisation. On May 1, 1891 the Melbourne Fire Brigade became the main fire brigade in Melbourne. The first annual report of the MFB stated its strength as [...] "59 permanent firefighters, 229 auxiliary firefighters, 4 steam fire engines, 25 horse drawn <b>hose</b> <b>carts</b> and 58 <b>hose</b> reels... 33 horses and 48 stations". In 1891, the Brigade attended 816 calls and 485 fires, of which 188 fires were classified as serious.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Borough Council {{turned over to}} the fire company a hand pumper {{purchased}} from Newtown Fire Association, and a <b>hose</b> <b>cart</b> purchased from Philadelphia with 800 ft of hose. One month later the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad presented the Fire Company with a tire for a steam locomotive driver wheel for use as a fire alarm. This was installed in a cupola of the Groover building (now in front of Silverdale Fire Company).|$|E
50|$|In 1911, the {{citizens}} of Upland created a volunteer fire department with F.H. Manker named as the Fire Chief.

In 1913, the first serious fire {{to occur in the}} new community destroyed all the businesses on the East side of Second Avenue South of Ninth Street. This fire generated interest in further protecting the community, and in 1915 the fire station on D Street was built. The first motorized fire engine was purchased at this time.|$|E
50|$|The 1886 hand drawn <b>hose</b> <b>cart</b> {{apparatus}} {{was replaced}} in 1903 with a horse-drawn wagon.

Cable television remains inaccessible.|$|R
5000|$|Wyndmoor Hose Company No. 1 {{was formed}} in 1906 and {{chartered}} in 1907. The seeds of the local fire company grew out of an industrial base at Mermaid Lane and Queen Street. There, the Nelson Valve Company began an in-house fire brigade {{to meet the needs}} of the dangerous industrial mechanisms used to make hydraulic valves. Eventually, the local community was solicited for its help in keeping this fire unit viable and expanding its services to the larger community. Residents volunteered, recognizing the communal benefit, and with help from the valve company a two-wheeled hand cart was purchased and 500 feet of hose. By 1909, the shed used at the valve Company was expanded, as were the <b>hose</b> <b>carts</b> to four wheels and two horses. Horse power proved a problem. A monetary reward was granted to the first horse team to arrive at the sound of the alarm and haul the apparatus to the scene. This actually produced a rivalry among horse teams! ...|$|R

50|$|The Orange Fire Department, as it {{was known}} in the beginning, came into {{existence}} on December 14, 1905 at a meeting between the city's Fire and Water Committees. Twenty-nine men signed up to join the all volunteer fire department. The volunteers were paid 50 cents a call if they didn't have to use water, $1 if they did and were also paid $1 per false alarm. Early on, there were often fights between the volunteers when an alarm went off, as they battled to see {{which would be the}} ones to pull the ladder wagon or <b>hose</b> <b>cart</b> to the fire, thus earning the pay for the call.|$|E
