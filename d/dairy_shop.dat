40|$|Aflatoxins (AFs), {{carcinogenic}} byproducts of fungi contaminating maize {{and other}} crops, {{can be carried}} over into meat and milk when aflatoxin-contaminated crops are fed to livestock. People who consume such animal products {{are exposed to the}} toxins. To assess the aflatoxin contamination status in marketed raw milk and associated risk factors in a densely populated peri-urban area in Nairobi, a descriptive cross-sectional census in the Dagoretti Division was designed. Structured questionnaires were filled in by face-to-face interviews with raw milk retailers. Small portions of milk were purchased from each respondent and brought to laboratory for competitive ELISA tests for aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1) detection. Geographic coordinates of each eligible retailer were recorded. A total of 350 milk retailers were visited and 344 were plotted on a map. Of them, 249 retailers answered the questionnaire and a milk sample from each of 200 retailers underwent ELISA test for AFM 1. Overview of raw milk distribution system in Dagoretti revealed that there were 5 business types: kiosks (71 %), <b>dairy</b> <b>shops</b> (21 %), street or door-to-door vendors (3 %) grocery stands (1 %) and unidentified (4 %), and their milk is mainly sourced directly from dairy farms (59 %) or from intermediate distributors (35 %). The majority of retailers sell below 20 litres of un-boiled milk. The mean daily milk consumption was 940 ml in adults and 729 ml in children. Although 58 % of retailers have heard about aflatoxins and the majority of them agreed that AF can be present in milk, only 29 % claimed “milk safety cannot be judged by sight or taste” and only 6 % that “milk is not completely safe even after boiling”. The ELISA test found the mean concentration of AFM 1 was 129 ± 16 (SE) ppt with maximum of 1, 675 ppt. Of all, 55 % exceeded EU maximum level of 50 ppt and 6 % exceeded Codex maximum level of 500 ppt. Compared to milk from street vendors, significantly higher AFM 1 was detected in milk from kiosks and <b>dairy</b> <b>shops,</b> especially when the milk was sourced to from farms without intermediate distributor.

People who consume such animal products {{are exposed to the}} toxins. To assess the aflatoxin contamination status in marketed raw milk and associated risk factors in peri-urban Nairobi, we conducted a census of raw milk retailers in Dagoretti Division, Nairobi, Kenya. Structured questionnaires were filled in by face-to-face interviews with all retailers who agreed to participate in this study. Small portions of milk were purchased from each respondent and tested for aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1) using competitive enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) tests. Geographic coordinates of each eligible retailer were recorded. A total of 350 milk retailers were visited and 344 were plotted on a map. Of these, 250 retailers answered the questionnaire and a milk sample from each of 200 retailers underwent cELISA analysis for AFM 1. Four types of businesses were found: kiosks (71 %), <b>dairy</b> <b>shops</b> (21 %), street or mobile vendors (3 %) and grocery stands (1 %); for 4 % the business type was not identified. Milk was mainly sourced directly from dairy farms (59 %) or from intermediate distributors (35 %). Most retailers sold less than 20 litres per day of raw milk. The mean daily milk consumption of the milk retailers’ households was 940 ml for adults and 729 ml for children. Although 58 % of retailers had heard about aflatoxins and the majority of them agreed that aflatoxins could be present in milk, only 29 % believed that “milk safety cannot be solely judged by sight or taste” and only 6 % that “milk is not completely safe even after boiling”. The cELISA test found the mean concentration of AFM 1 was 128. 7 parts per trillion (ppt) (median= 49. 9; 95 % confidence interval= 3. 0 – 822. 8) with a maximum of 1675 ppt. Overall, 55 % of samples exceeded the European Union maximum level of 50 ppt and 6 % exceeded the recommended maximum level of the United States Food and Drug Administration of 500 ppt. Compared to milk from street vendors, a significantly higher amount of AFM 1 was detected in milk from kiosks and <b>dairy</b> <b>shops,</b> especially when the milk was sourced from farms without an intermediate distributor.
