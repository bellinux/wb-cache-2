5|$|Cataclysmic or {{explosive}} {{variable stars}} {{are those that}} undergo a <b>dramatic</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> their properties. This group includes novae and supernovae. A binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a Type 1a supernova. The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion. Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.|$|E
5|$|Seasons {{may play}} a role in some regions. A <b>dramatic</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> colour and texture is created by {{seasonal}} snowy conditions in northern latitudes, necessitating repainting of vehicles and separate snow oversuits. The Eastern and northern European countries have a tradition for separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits.|$|E
5|$|The {{current flag}} design {{represents}} a <b>dramatic</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> {{the evolution of}} the Portuguese standard, which had always been closely associated with the royal arms, blue and white. Since the country's foundation, the national flag developed from the bluecross-on-white armorial square banner of King Afonso I to the liberal monarchy's arms over a blue-and-white rectangle. In between, major changes associated with determinant political events contributed to its evolution into the current design.|$|E

5|$|Hale–Bopp {{may have}} had a near {{collision}} with Jupiter in early June 2215BC, which probably caused a <b>dramatic</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> its orbit, and 2215BC may have been its first passage through the inner Solar System. The comet's current orbit is almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, so further close approaches to planets will be rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within 0.77AU of Jupiter, close enough for its orbit to be measurably affected by the planet's gravity. The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2,533years, and it will next return to the inner Solar System around the year 4385. Its greatest distance from the Sun (aphelion) will be about 370AU, reduced from about 525AU.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{character}} underwent a <b>dramatic</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> storyline when {{the role of}} Nick and Sharon's fourteen-year-old daughter Cassie was killed off after a car accident. This led Nick to seek comfort {{in the arms of}} another woman, Phyllis Summers, which resulted in an affair. Phyllis became pregnant with Nick's child, Summer Newman. Nick divorced Sharon and married Phyllis the following year. For years, however, Nick battled between his ongoing feelings with Sharon and Phyllis. His other storylines have included trying to seek independence away from his powerful father as well as multiple other relationships. In 2013, a storyline regarding Summer's paternity was visited, centered on speculation that she is actually the daughter of Jack Abbott, Phyllis' ex-husband.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} also subject to criticism, however. Next Generation {{objected to the}} {{difficulty}} level, wondering if the challenge was added to prolong the gameplay. The Electric Playground pointed to the unusual control scheme and lack of configuration options. GameSpy cited the camera's behavior, the learning curve for the controls, and graphical shortcomings such as flickering and jagginess. GameSpot criticized the game's conclusion for its <b>dramatic</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> gameplay to a rail shooter-like style at the story's climax, {{as well as a}} leveling-off of the difficulty. Lastly, Gamecritics felt that the story was overly short and the characters were underdeveloped.|$|E

5|$|Werner Erhard (born John Paul Rosenberg), a California-based former salesman, {{training}} manager and {{executive in the}} encyclopedia business, created the Erhard Seminars Training (est) course in 1971. est {{was a form of}} Large Group Awareness Training, and was part of the Human Potential Movement. est was a four-day, 60-hour self-help program given to groups of 250people at a time. The program was very intensive: each day would contain 15–20hours of instruction. During the training, est personnel utilized jargon to convey key concepts, and participants had to agree to certain rules which remained in effect {{for the duration of the}} course. Participants were taught that they were responsible for their life outcomes, and were promised a <b>dramatic</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> their self-perception.|$|E

5|$|Located {{close to}} Polaris is Lambda Ursae Minoris, a red giant of {{spectral}} type M1III. It is a semiregular variable varying from magnitudes 6.35 to 6.45. The northerly {{nature of the}} constellation means that the variable stars can be observed all year: the red giant R Ursae Minoris is a semiregular variable varying from magnitude 8.5 to 11.5 over 328days, while S Ursae Minoris is a long period variable that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 11 over 331days. Located south of Kochab and Pherkad towards Draco is RR Ursae Minoris, a red giant of spectral type M5III that is also a semiregular variable ranging from magnitude 4.44 to 4.85 {{over a period of}} 43.3days. T Ursae Minoris is another red giant variable star that has undergone a <b>dramatic</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> status—from being a long period (Mira) variable ranging from magnitude 7.8 to 15 over 310–315 days to a semiregular variable. The star is thought to have undergone a shell helium flash—a point where the shell of helium around the star's core reaches a critical mass and ignites—marked by its abrupt change in variability in 1979. Z Ursae Minoris is a faint variable star that suddenly dropped 6magnitudes in 1992 and was identified as one of a rare class of stars—R Coronae Borealis variables.|$|E

25|$|A {{far more}} {{atmospheric}} album {{than the previous}} War, The Unforgettable Fire {{was at the time}} the band's most <b>dramatic</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> direction. It has a rich and orchestrated sound and was the first U2 album with a cohesive sound. Under Lanois' direction, Larry's drumming became looser, funkier and more subtle, and Adam's bass became more subliminal, such that the rhythm section no longer intruded, but flowed in support of the songs.|$|E
25|$|The {{passage of}} five years brought a <b>dramatic</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> circumstances.

The power of the Princes of Aragón was sundered, and Barrientos had to react rapidly to the shifting political climate.|$|E

25|$|The vast wealth {{generated}} by oil revenues {{was beginning to}} have an even greater impact on Saudi society.

This and the presence of increasingly large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional Saudi norms and values. Although there was <b>dramatic</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the social and economic life of the country, political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family leading to discontent among many Saudis who began to look for wider participation in government.|$|E
25|$|Global warming {{could lead}} to an {{increase}} in pest insect populations, harming yields of staple crops like wheat, soybeans, and corn. While warmer temperatures create longer growing seasons, and faster growth rates for plants, it also increases the metabolic rate and number of breeding cycles of insect populations. Insects that previously had only two breeding cycles per year could gain an additional cycle if warm growing seasons extend, causing a population boom. Temperate places and higher latitudes are more likely to experience a <b>dramatic</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> insect populations.|$|E

Gaggi's close associate, underboss Carlo Gambino, became the new boss. He appointed caporegime Aniello Dellacroce, an Anastasia loyalist, as underboss and gave him control over the Manhattan faction of the family.|$|E
