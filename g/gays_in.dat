5|$|Gerber set out {{to expand}} the Society's {{membership}} beyond the original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer <b>gays</b> <b>in</b> joining; he was also unable to gain any financial support from the more affluent members of Chicago's gay community. Gerber sought out the support {{of people in the}} medical professions and sex education advocates and was frustrated when he was unable to secure it, because of their fear of ruining their reputations through the association with homosexuality. Contemplating this failure in 1962, Gerber stated, The first difficulty was in rounding up enough members and contributors so the work could go forward. The average homosexual, I found, was ignorant concerning himself. Others were fearful. Still others were frantic or depraved. Some were blasé. Many homosexuals told me that their search for forbidden fruit was the real spice of life. With this argument, they rejected our aims. We wondered how we could accomplish anything with such resistance from our own people. Gerber shouldered all of the labor and financial obligations for the Society and for production of Friendship and Freedom, something he was willing to do in service of the cause, believing it possible he would be remembered as the gay Abraham Lincoln for his effort. The Society sought affiliation with the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology but the British Society declined, afraid of being linked with any organization that was specifically for homosexuals.|$|E

25|$|The Democratic Party is {{supportive}} of LGBT rights. Most support for same-sex {{marriage in the}} United States has come from Democrats, although some favor civil unions instead or oppose same-sex marriage. Support for same-sex marriage has increased {{in the past decade}} according to ABC News. An April 2009 ABC News/Washington Post public opinion poll put support among Democrats at 62%, while a June 2008 Newsweek poll found that 42% of Democrats support same-sex marriage while 23% support civil unions or domestic partnership laws and 28% oppose any legal recognition at all. A broad majority of Democrats have supported other LGBT-related laws such as extending hate crime statutes, legally preventing discrimination against LGBT people in the workforce, and repealing Don't ask, don't tell. A 2006 Pew Research Center poll of Democrats found that 55% supported gays adopting children with 40% opposed while 70% support <b>gays</b> <b>in</b> the military with only 23% opposed. Gallup polling from May 2009 stated that 82% of Democrats support open enlistment.|$|E

500|$|Baker {{was born}} in Long Beach, California and raised in what he {{considered}} a [...] "stifling, Republican Southern Californian household". Rebelling against his parents, he became attracted to the fringe elements of society, including beatniks (anyone living as a bohemian, acting rebelliously, or appearing to advocate a revolution in manners), artists and <b>gays.</b> <b>In</b> high school during the 1960s he explored his sexuality at underground gay teen nightclubs, while living in fear that his abusive father would find out. At one point, his father hired a private detective to follow him, when he suspected Baker {{was having an affair}} with a male neighbor. This family dynamic would be used in many of his novels, most extensively in Boy Wonder.|$|E
500|$|In early 2010, {{a primary}} {{challenge}} from {{radio talk show}} host and former U.S. Congressman J. D.

With Hayworth using the campaign slogan [...] "The Consistent Conservative", McCain said – despite his own past use of the term {{on a number of occasions}} – [...] "I never considered myself a maverick. I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities." [...] The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts, closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, campaign finance restrictions, and <b>gays</b> <b>in</b> the military.|$|E

She helped start what was then called the National Gay Task Force, later to be named the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) in 1973. Gittings served {{on the board of the}} NGLTF throughout the 1980s. She inspired nurses to form the Gay Nurses Alliance in 1973.

500|$|Marvel Comics' {{incorporation}} of LGBT themes has been unfavorably {{compared with that}} of DC; its use of gay characters has been described as [...] "less prolific but more deliberate". Marvel reportedly had a [...] "No <b>Gays</b> <b>in</b> the Marvel Universe" [...] policy during Jim Shooter's 1980s tenure, and Marvel's policy from the 1990s had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an [...] "Adults Only" [...] label, in response to conservative protests. Yet in 2006 publisher Joe Quesada claimed that this policy is no longer in force. Although same-sex couples are depicted occasionally kissing, intimate or sexual scenes have not been shown, even in Marvel's [...] "Adult only" [...] imprint. The use of mutants and the discrimination they face in the X-Men comics has been seen {{as a metaphor for the}} real-world discrimination directed at minority groups including LGBT people.|$|E
500|$|The Baird {{nomination}} was emblematic of other difficulties Clinton had {{during the transition}} period and his early days in office, including most prominently the dropping of a promised middle-class tax cut and resistance to his proposal to allow <b>gays</b> <b>in</b> the military. [...] Stephanopoulos later wrote that [...] "We should have never let the Baird nomination get {{as far as it}} did, but our systems failed us at every crucial step." [...] And the timing of the announcement of the Wood withdrawal detracted attention from the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the first legislative achievement of the Clinton administration. While a Gallup Poll showed that only 22percent of the public said that Clinton's difficulties in naming someone for Attorney General decreased their confidence in his ability to lead the country, overall, Clinton experienced the highest disapproval ratings at the start of any presidency since such polling began. [...] His [...] "presidential honeymoon" [...] period was thus extremely brief.|$|E
500|$|Censor issues {{required}} multiple {{changes to}} the episode. The line when Peter says, [...] "It's not like we're {{going to have a}} gay sex orgy in the living room," [...] was originally, [...] "Come on Lois, we're not going to drill glory holes in the living room." [...] The show received a broadcast standards request that the anti-gay video the priest shows Lois say [...] "Pat Robertson Industries," [...] so as not {{to make it look like}} Fox had an opinion about homosexuals. The writers had a problem with Lois being against gay marriage, as they felt they were not portraying her in a way that is consistent with other episodes as she expressed a more liberal viewpoint on many past issues on the show and even expressed a generally more accepting view of <b>gays</b> <b>in</b> the episode Brian Sings and Swings. The DVD version has a deleted scene during the backyard wedding ending where Ricardo (who doesn't speak English) asks Stewie what's going on and Stewie (who speaks Tagalog) tells Ricardo that he'll find out on his wedding night.|$|E

500|$|His first book, Adrenaline, was {{published}} under the pseudonym James Dillinger. A {{story of two}} gay fugitive lovers on the run, it presaged the satire and drug fueled violence so prominent in his later books. Here Baker began developing the themes that dominated his following works: anarchy; angry and somewhat paranoid gay men; the dark underside of Los Angeles, juxtaposed with its sunny outward image; the hypocrisy of organized religion; anonymous sex and its implications {{in the age of}} AIDS; and homophobia and the oppression of <b>gays</b> <b>in</b> a Republican dominated America.See Also: Levy, Dan. [...] "Up-Front or Undercover?" [...] San Francisco Chronicle, June 20, 1993; Section: Sunday Review; Pg. 9 Its plot device of underdog characters forced into flight due to circumstances beyond their control was one Baker explored in all of his subsequent work. The modest success of this novel encouraged him to devote himself to what have become his best known works, Fuel-Injected Dreams (a novel revolving around a character loosely based on record producer Phil Spector) and the 1986 release Boy Wonder. After the novel {{was published}}, he stopped screenwriting in order to solely concentrate on books. He spent the bulk of each day writing and researching, and acted out characters and scenes of his novels on videotape to perfect the dialogue.|$|E
500|$|Marvel Comics' {{incorporation}} of LGBT themes has been unfavorably {{compared with that}} of DC; its use of gay characters has been described as [...] "less prolific but more deliberate". Marvel reportedly had a [...] "No <b>Gays</b> <b>in</b> the Marvel Universe" [...] policy during Jim Shooter's 1980s tenure, and Marvel's policy from the 1990s had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an [...] "Adults Only" [...] label, in response to conservative protests. However, these policies did not stop creators from slipping in gay characters and themes; J.M. DeMatteis introduced Arnie Roth, a childhood friend of Steve Rogers, who comes to Cap seeking help in rescuing his [...] "roommate" [...] Michael. Later, Arnie himself is captured by Baron Zemo and forced to dress in flamboyant clothes and stage make-up and give a speech about how his love for Michael is false and unnatural. Cap rescues Arnie and reassures him that his love for Michael is as genuine as Cap's own love for his girlfriend, Sharon. The story appears to have gone under the radar purely because DeMatteis did not use the word [...] "gay". Subsequent official character biographies have confirmed Arnie Roth as gay. As of 2006, these policies are no longer enforced and LGBT characters appear regularly in Marvel comics. Although same-sex couples are depicted occasionally kissing, intimate or sexual scenes have not been shown, even in Marvel's [...] "Adult only" [...] imprint.
