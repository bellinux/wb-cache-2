5|$|Several ice ages {{shaped the}} land through <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion,</b> {{creating}} u-shaped valleys and depositing boulder clays, {{especially on the}} western seaboard. The last major incursion of ice peaked about 18,000 years ago, leaving other remnant features such at the granite tors on the Cairngorm mountain plateaux.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{may have}} once been a towering stratovolcano, Goat Rocks has {{undergone}} extensive erosion since its extinction. Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion,</b> as well as hydrothermal alteration of the volcano's interior, stripped away layers of volcanic ash deposits and lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the conduits of the volcano. Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.|$|E
5000|$|A 1978 report noted [...] "spectacular" [...] {{signs of}} <b>glacial</b> meltwater <b>erosion</b> on Salem Creek in a 1500 ft long stretch {{just south of}} the glacial terminus, near an old dam. These signs of <b>glacial</b> meltwater <b>erosion</b> are a series of {{potholes}} or plunge pools in the creek's valley. The potholes are in sandstone and siltstone of the Trimmers Rock Formation. They are 15 ft wide and 10 to 15 ft deep. The potholes were later breached due to downcutting.|$|R

50|$|During {{the period}} that {{immediately}} followed {{the end of the}} Wisconsin glaciation, the geographic features that would become North America's Great Lakes significantly changed in shape and size. <b>Glacial</b> melt, catastrophic <b>erosion</b> events as dammed-up waters found new outlets, and the post-glacial rebound of this section of the Earth's crust, caused various freshwater lakes in this area to form, drain away, and re-form.|$|R
5|$|The {{northern}} {{section of}} Darby Creek {{is within the}} Piedmont Uplands physiographic province, while the southern section {{is part of the}} Atlantic Coastal Plain province. The Piedmont Uplands section has generally old, hard upland rocks that eroded from the Appalachian Mountains. The rocks from the northern portion of the watershed date to the Precambrian Era and Lower Paleozoic Era. The rocks from the southern portion of the watershed are newer, dating from the Tertiary and Quaternary Periods. Atlantic Coastal Plain rock is generally softer than Piedmont Uplands rock and was deposited in the area about 1.6 million years ago through <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{the bedrock}} has {{frequent}} fractures on the surface, <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion</b> rates tend {{to increase as}} plucking is the main erosive force on the surface; when the bedrock has wide gaps between sporadic fractures, however, abrasion {{tends to be the}} dominant erosive form and <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion</b> rates become slow.|$|E
25|$|The Chief {{is part of}} a {{medium-sized}} pluton of a granitic rock (granodiorite) that was initially formed in the early Cretaceous (approximately 100 million years ago) by the slow cooling and solidification of molten magma deep {{below the surface of the}} Earth. Exhumation of the granite body probably occurred mostly by erosion of overlying rocks over tens of millions of years, with <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion</b> processes dominating exhumation over the last 2.5 million years. Once exposed at the surface, the original granite body was shaped by <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion,</b> which is responsible for the tall steep walls that define the Chief, as well as the excavation of Howe Sound, a fjord. Classic hallmarks of <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion</b> are ubiquitous, especially polished, striated surfaces. Polish and striations observable at the very summit of the formation require that, at the peak of glaciation, the entire formation was buried under a substantial thickness of ice.|$|E
50|$|Proposed tectonic aneurysms {{are located}} in the Saint Elias region of Alaska, the Kongur Shan and Muztagh Ata in China, and the Lepontine Dome in the Swiss Alps. These {{locations}} show incipient or similar, less significant characteristics to actively observed systems. <b>Glacial</b> mechanisms of <b>erosion</b> and transport are believed to be responsible in many alpine areas including the Saint Elias system.|$|R
40|$|Geologists are {{interested}} in Cape Cod, Massachusetts because it formed by glaciers very recently in terms of geologic time, {{and because of the}} ever-changing shore as the Cape adjusts to the rising sea.

50|$|Another way bays form is via <b>glacial</b> {{and river}} <b>erosion.</b> A bay formed by a glacier is a fjord. Rias {{are created by}} rivers and are characterised by more gradual slopes. Currents can make waves more constant, and soft rocks speed erosion. Hard rock eroded less quickly, leaving headlands. The Gulf of California {{is an example of}} a bay created by plate {{tectonics}} as Baja California peninsula moves away from the Mexican mainland.|$|R
25|$|In Europe, <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion</b> and {{isostatic}} sinking from {{weight of}} ice made the Baltic Sea, which before the Ice Age was all land drained by the Eridanos River.|$|E

25|$|The central {{position}} of the lake on the mountain has led to claims that Mont Saint-Hilaire is a volcanic caldera. However, the lake is actually the result of <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion,</b> and in no way an ancient volcanic crater.|$|E
2500|$|Erratics {{are formed}} by <b>glacial</b> ice <b>erosion</b> {{resulting}} from the movement of ice. Glaciers erode by multiple processes: abrasion/scouring, plucking, ice thrusting and glacially-induced spalling. Glaciers crack pieces of bedrock off {{in the process of}} plucking, producing the larger erratics. In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood, producing smaller glacial till. [...] In ice thrusting, the glacier freezes to its bed, then as it surges forward, it moves large sheets of frozen sediment at the base along with the glacier. Glacially-induced spalling occurs when ice lens formation with the rocks below the glacier spall off layers of rock, providing smaller debris which is ground into the glacial basal material to become till.|$|R
25|$|The granite {{that forms}} Mount Whitney {{is part of}} the Sierra Nevada batholith. In Cretaceous time, masses of molten rock that {{originated}} from subduction rose underneath what is now Whitney and solidified underground to form large expanses of granite. In the last 2 to 10 million years, the Sierra was pushed up which enabled <b>glacial</b> and river <b>erosion</b> to strip the upper layers of rock to reveal the resistant granite that makes up Mount Whitney today.|$|R
50|$|Negra Muerta is a caldera with {{dimensions}} of 12 x 7 km that was formed over two volcanic periods, one about 9 {{million years ago}} and another over 7 million years ago. Each volcanic period included the formation of ignimbrites, the Acay ignimbrite {{in the first and}} the Toba 1 ignimbrite in the second. After the Toba 1 ignimbrite, effusive activity forming lava flows occurred. After the cessation of volcanic activity, <b>glacial</b> and fluvial <b>erosion</b> has exposed subvolcanic structures.|$|R
25|$|Other {{prominent}} landforms such as Calton Hill and Corstorphine Hill {{are also}} products of <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion.</b> The Braid Hills and Blackford Hill are {{a series of}} small summits to the city's south west that command expansive views looking northwards over the urban area to the Forth.|$|E
25|$|Cadair Idris or Cader Idris is a {{mountain}} in Gwynedd, Wales, which {{lies at the}} southern end of the Snowdonia National Park near the town of Dolgellau. The peak, which is one of the most popular in Wales for walkers and hikers, is composed largely of Ordovician igneous rocks, with classic <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion</b> features such as cwms, moraines, striated rocks, and roches moutonnées.|$|E
25|$|What {{remains of}} the oldest of Mount Shasta's four cones is exposed at Sargents Ridge {{on the south side}} of the mountain. Lavas from the Sargents Ridge vent cover the Everitt Hill shield at Mount Shasta's {{southern}} foot. The last lavas to erupt from the vent were hornblende-pyroxene andesites with a hornblende dacite dome at its summit. <b>Glacial</b> <b>erosion</b> has since modified its shape.|$|E

50|$|The {{mountain}} {{was formed}} by <b>glacial</b> action and <b>erosion</b> and is characterised, for the most part, by the dolerite slabs and boulders typical of the alpine regions of the state. Many of the summits in Tasmania are rather obscure tors perched only slightly higher than the alpine plateau on which they sit. Barn Bluff, like Cradle Mountain, presents a classic summit. The mountain’s nearest neighbours are quite distant and, therefore, the 360 degree panorama from the summit is uninterrupted and spectacular.|$|R

25|$|The {{topography}} of present-day Science Hill was primarily formed during the Wisconsinan glaciation. The Laurentide ice sheet flattened the soft sandstone of New Haven Harbor but had less effect on its surrounding, hard trap rock formations like East Rock and West Rock. Science Hill is {{a portion of}} a sandstone drumlin that was sheltered from <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion</b> by a traprock ridge, Mill Rock, to its north.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} {{of so much}} ice upon the continents {{had a profound effect}} upon almost every aspect of Earth's hydrologic system. The most obvious effects are the spectacular mountain scenery and other continental landscapes fashioned both by <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion</b> and deposition instead of running water. Entirely new landscapes covering millions of square kilometers were formed in {{a relatively short period of}} geologic time. In addition, the vast bodies of glacial ice affected Earth well beyond the glacier margins. Directly or indirectly, the effects of glaciation were felt in every part of the world.|$|E
25|$|This area then {{underwent}} intense erosion, {{giving the}} countryside the shape one sees today. However, unlike the southernmost {{sections of the}} Scandes, such as those around Sarek National Park, the countryside around Fulufjället is not particularly marked by <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion.</b> Indeed, even {{at the height of}} glaciation during the Quaternary period, when the mountain was covered by an ice sheet, the movement of the ice was feeble, and did not significantly erode the massif. Instead, the most marked erosion took place during the Tertiary period, entirely under a tropical climate.|$|E
50|$|The rock {{which forms}} the visible surface of Mount Timpanogos is {{primarily}} limestone composed of compacted sediment laid down onto an ancient seafloor {{over millions of}} years during the late Carboniferous Period (roughly 300 million years ago). Older rock exists beneath the limestone on the surface. The limestone was subsequently lifted high above sea level and the mountain itself became prominent as the Western valley sunk due to basin and range faulting. The most contemporary features of the mountain were formed through recent <b>glacial</b> and water <b>erosion.</b>|$|R
40|$|There is current {{interest}} in the riverine fluxes of bicarbonate and Si at the last glacial maximum (LGM), since modelling suggests that these were higher than today (Gibbs and Kump, 1994; Froelich et al., 1992). If this is the case, removal of atmospheric CO 2 by silicate weathering {{is also likely to}} have been greater at the LGM (Munhoven and Francois, 1996), so contributing to the lower atmospheric CO 2 recorded by ice cores (Barnola et al., 1987). To date, the magnitude of <b>glacial</b> chemical <b>erosion</b> on bicarbonate and Si fluxes at the LGM is poorly quantified, and the locus of the inferred doubled terrestrial Si flux is unknown. This paper aims to provide first estimates of the relative fluxes of bicarbonate and Si fluxes from ice-free and glaciated terrain for five time steps between the LGM (21 ka), by extending the modelling approach of Gibbs and Kump (1994) and incorporating new data on glacial solute fluxes (Tranter et al., submitted).

40|$|The seismostratigraphic and {{structural}} {{analysis of the}} whole length of the Magellan Strait, from the Atlantic to the Pacific entrance is for first time illustrated {{on the basis of}} multichannel seismic (MCS) profiles. The Strait crosses a geologically complex region that includes different morphotectonic provinces, and has been subdivided into three distinct segments, eastern (Atlantic), central, and western (Pacific), being each segment characterized by peculiar sedimentary and tectonic architectures. The MCS profiles shed light on the subsurface of the region in particular on the Quaternary and Tertiary features. In the foreland basin province, the MCS profiles imaged an almost undeformed structural and stratigraphic frame with very thick Cretaceous to Tertiary package. Seismic evidence of deformation of the foreland units occurs in the fold-and-thrust belt province. Along the Cordillera province, the Magallanes-Fagnano transform fault exerts an important morpho-tectonic control that strongly conditions its bathymetric profile. The seismic profiles also highlighted a number of depositional features linked to the up to 150 m thick sedimentary record of the glacial cycles. Whereas the eastern segment (outer foreland province) is devoid of significant glacial-related deposits, the central segment (inner foreland and fold-and thrust belt provinces) shows evidence of repeated advances and retreats of the Magellan glacier. An important moraine ridge complex, probably corresponding to the glacial advance “D”of Clapperton et al., has been seismically imaged in the central segment, as well as an older, large bank of ice distal sediments that have been interpreted as proglacial lake deposits, which show evident signs of repeated <b>glacial</b> <b>erosions.</b> Ice-contact features in the form of frontal moraine complexes made up of dipping foreset strata are present in the fjord-like, western segment of the Strait (Cordillera province), along with their related ice-proximal and ice-distal facies. Eventually, the occurrence of preglacial sediments tectonized by the Magallanes-Fagnano transform fault has been reported in the same segment. This fact, which is supported by small outcrops reported in the updated geologic map, if substantiated by further investigations (i. e. advanced seismic reprocessing, sea bottom samplings), would prove the relatively young age (Late Miocene?) of the Magallanes-Fagnano transform fault...|$|R
25|$|Wetlands {{are very}} common in this biome, {{including}} lakes, shallow open water, marshes, and grassy wetlands. <b>Glacial</b> <b>erosion</b> has contributed to such features by creating depressions in which standing water can collect. In the larger depressions, permanent lakes or ponds of water remain. Many of the lakes have a saline character, thus most shore vegetation has a high tolerance of salty soils. These lakes are known as alkali lakes. Wet meadows are flooded {{in the spring and}} dry by fall. They contain rushes, sedges and grasses and provide excellent opportunities to study the similarities and differences of these forms of vegetation.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} end of the county is on the chalk ridge known as the Chiltern Hills. The remainder is part of the broad drainage basin of the River Great Ouse and its tributaries. Most of Bedfordshire's rocks are clays and sandstones from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, with some limestone. Local clay has been used for brick-making of Fletton style bricks in the Marston Vale. <b>Glacial</b> <b>erosion</b> of chalk has left the hard flint nodules deposited as gravel—this has been commercially extracted in the past at pits which are now lakes, at Priory Country Park, Wyboston and Felmersham. The Greensand Ridge is an escarpment across the county from near Leighton Buzzard to near Gamlingay in Cambridgeshire.|$|E
25|$|The land {{surrounding}} Stirling {{has been}} most affected by <b>glacial</b> <b>erosion</b> and deposition. The city itself has grown up around its castle which stands atop an ancient quartz-dolerite sill, known as the Stirling Sill, a major defensive position which was at the lowest crossing point on the River Forth. Stirling stands on the Forth {{at the point where}} the river widens and becomes tidal. To the east of the city the Ochil Hills dominate the skyline with the highest peak in the range being Ben Cleuch, although Dumyat is more noticeable from Stirling. The Ochils meet the flat carse (floodplain) of the River Forth to the east of the distinctive geographical feature of Abbey Craig, a crag and tail hill upon which stands the 220ft (67m) high National Wallace Monument.|$|E

40|$|A {{relief map}} of {{the surface of the}} prequarternary sediments of {{northern}} and eastern Switzerland is presented. This compilation shows the importance of <b>glacial</b> and fluviatile <b>erosion</b> of alpine and prealpine valleys during the Quaternary, particularly during the "big glaciation" (Riss glaciation?). In the marginal alpine lakes (Lake Constance, Walensee, Lake of Zug and Vierwaldstättersee) the depth of the base of the quaternary sediments varies between 100 m below and 100 m above sea level. A basement to 200 m below sea level has been measured in a well southeast of Lake Constance.
