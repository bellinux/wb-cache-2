In so doing, he established a research program which embraced multiple aspects of human variation, from mental characteristics to height; from <b>facial</b> <b>images</b> to fingerprint patterns. This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale collection of data using those measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing and understanding the data.|$|E

The results showed that a talking <b>facial</b> <b>image</b> was rated as more pleasant and arousing as compared to a static <b>facial</b> <b>image,</b> and elicited progressively increasing zygomatic EMG activity.

As an important hint for human communication, <b>facial</b> <b>images</b> contain lots of useful information including gender, expression, age, etc. Unfortunately, compared with other cognition problems, age estimation from <b>facial</b> <b>images</b> is still very challenging. This is mainly because the aging process is influenced not only by a person's genes but also many external factors. Physical condition, living style etc. may accelerate or slow the aging process. Besides, since the aging process is slow and with long duration, collecting sufficient data for training is fairly demanding work.|$|E

40|$|Much {{contemporary}} {{debate in}} forensic science concerns validity and admissibility of scientific evidence in court. In this paper, three current approaches to facial identification—image superimposition, photogrammetry, and morphological analysis—are considered {{with regard to}} criteria for scientific evidence in the United States, and England, and Wales. The aim of the paper is to assess {{the extent to which}} <b>facial</b> <b>image</b> comparison meets criteria of admissibility in these jurisdictions. The method used is a comparative evaluation of the methods of <b>facial</b> <b>image</b> comparison and their underlying premises against the range of admissibility criteria reported in court rulings and relevant judicial and scientific inquiries in the United States and the United Kingdom. While the techniques of <b>facial</b> <b>image</b> comparison are generally accepted within their practitioner communities, they are not tested, and their error rates are unknown. On that basis, the methods of <b>facial</b> <b>image</b> comparison would appear not to meet the anticipated standards. They are, nevertheless, admitted in court in the United States, and England, and Wales. This paper concludes that further research in science and law will be necessary to more definitively establish admissibility of <b>facial</b> <b>image</b> comparison evidence, as it will for other nascent and novel methods that are potentially influential in court proceedings...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} main contenders for {{improving}} face recognition algorithms: high resolution images, three-dimensional (3D) face recognition, and new preprocessing techniques. The FRGC is simultaneously pursuing and will assess {{the merit of}} all three techniques. Current face recognition systems are designed to work on relatively small still <b>facial</b> <b>images.</b> The traditional method for measuring {{the size of a}} face is the number of pixels between the centers of the eyes. In current images there are 40 to 60 pixels between the centers of the eyes (10,000 to 20,000 pixels on the face). In the FRGC, high resolution images consist of <b>facial</b> <b>images</b> with 250 pixels between the centers of the eyes on average. The FRGC will facilitate the development of new algorithms that take advantage of the additional information inherent in high resolution images.|$|E
