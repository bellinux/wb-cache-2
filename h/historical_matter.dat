2500|$|While Dillon and Miss Kitty {{clearly had}} a close {{personal}} relationship, the two never married. In a July 2, 2002, Associated Press interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, [...] "If they were man and wife, {{it would make a}} lot of difference. The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which I totally agreed with." [...] In the episode [...] "Waste", featuring Johnny Whitaker as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. It appears that bordellos could exist [...] "at the law's discretion" [...] (meaning the marshal's). As an <b>historical</b> <b>matter,</b> prior to the First World War, few laws criminalized prostitution in the United States. Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress sought more free time and reportedly missed her late co-star, Glenn Strange, who played her Long Branch barkeep, Sam. When Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, matronly actress Fran Ryan (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS' Green Acres).|$|E
2500|$|Change {{of title}} and {{extension}} of scope – Preface to Volume 6.Editorial AnnouncementThe Editors desire to announce to their readers an important modification in {{the scope and}} contents of this work. As originally planned and hitherto announced, the series was intended to furnish the original sources, printed and documentary, {{for the history of}} the Philippine Islands only {{to the beginning of the}} nineteenth century. To most of our readers, the reasons for this are obvious: the fact that the classic period of Philippine history is thus bounded; the comparative rarity and inaccessibility of most material therein to the general public; the vast extent of the field covered by Philippine history, and the necessary limitations of space imposed upon the selection of material for this work; the closing of foreign archives to all investigators after an early date in the nineteenth century; and the greater difficulty, in that later period, of securing a proper historical perspective. But so many and urgent requests have come to us, from subscribers and reviewers, for such extension of this series as shall cover the entire period of Spanish domination, that we have decided to modify the former plan in the manner here briefly indicated.It is our purpose not to exceed the number of volumes already announced, fifty-five. We are able to do this because in our original plan, to avoid a subsequent increase in the number of volumes, a certain amount of space was purposely left for possible future changes as a result of later investigations to be made in foreign archives, or on account of the necessary excision of extraneous or irrelevant matter from the printed works which are to be presented in this series. The new title will be [...] "The Philippine Islands: 1493–1898." [...] The early and especially important history of the islands will be covered as fully as before. For the history of the nineteenth century, we will present various important decrees, reports, and other official documents; and provide a clear, careful, and impartial synopsis of some of the best <b>historical</b> <b>matter</b> extant, down to the close of the Spanish régime. Throughout the series will be used, as has been done from the beginning, all the best material available – historical, descriptive, and statistical – for reference and annotation. With the copious and prepared bibliography of Philippine historical literature, and the full analytical index, which will close the series; the broad and representative character of the material selected throughout; and the impartial and non-sectarian attitude maintained, the Editors trust that this change will still further enable scholars, historical writers, and general readers alike to study, with reliable and satisfactory material, the history of the Philippine Islands from their first discovery by Europeans to the close of the Spanish régime, and incidentally the history of the entire Orient.|$|E

50|$|Besides {{the three}} orations already mentioned, which are {{undoubtedly}} genuine, {{there is a}} fourth against Alcibiades (κατὰ Ἀλκιβιάδου), {{said to have been}} delivered by Andocides during the ostracism of 415 BC; but it is probably spurious, though it appears to contain genuine <b>historical</b> <b>matter.</b> Some scholars ascribed it to Phaeax, {{who took part in the}} ostracism, according to Plutarch. But it is more likely that it is a rhetorical exercise from the early fourth century BC, since formal speeches were not delivered during ostracisms and the accusation or defence of Alcibiades was a standing rhetorical theme. Besides these four orations we possess only a few fragments and some very vague allusions to other orations.|$|E
50|$|As a <b>historical</b> <b>matter,</b> U.S. {{citizenship}} {{could be}} forfeited upon the undertaking of various acts, including naturalization {{in a foreign}} state (with a willful intent to renounce U.S. citizenship) or service in foreign armed forces. In addition, before 1967 {{it was possible to}} lose the citizenship due to voting in foreign elections. However, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the provisions of Section 349(a) which provided for loss of nationality by voting in a foreign election in the case Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, specifically outlines how loss of nationality may occur, which predominantly involves willful acts over the age of 18 with the intention of relinquishing United States nationality. U.S. Supreme Court decisions beginning with Afroyim v. Rusk constitutionally limited the government's capacity to terminate citizenship to those cases in which an individual engaged in conduct with an intention of abandoning their citizenship.|$|E
