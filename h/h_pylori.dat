5|$|Covacci et al. {{sequence}} the CagA gene, which encodes for a cytotoxin-associated surface protein, which correlated {{strongly with}} strains of <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> that caused duodenal ulcers. This {{was the first}} description of a virulence factor for <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> infection determined by molecular techniques.|$|E
5|$|First {{report of}} {{resistance}} of <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> to the antibiotic metronidazole. Resistance of <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> to treatment {{will lead to}} the development of many different antibiotic and proton pump inhibitor regimens for eradication.|$|E
5|$|Study of the <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> genome is {{centered}} on attempts to understand pathogenesis, the ability of this organism to cause disease. About 29% of the loci have acolonization defectwhen mutated. Two of sequenced strains have an around 40-kb-long Cag pathogenicity island (a common gene sequence believed responsible for pathogenesis) that contains over 40 genes. This pathogenicity island is usually absent from <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> strains isolated from humans who are carriers of <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> but remain asymptomatic.|$|E
5|$|Tomb et al. {{complete}} {{sequencing of}} the entire 1,667,867 base pairs of the <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> genome. This assists in identifying new virulence factors for the infectivity of <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> on the molecular level.|$|E

5|$|Colonization with <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E

5|$|<b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> is a helix-shaped (classified as {{a curved}} rod, not spirochaete) Gram-negative {{bacterium}} about 3μm long with {{a diameter of}} about 0.5μm. <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> can be demonstrated in tissue by Gram stain, Giemsa stain, haematoxylin–eosin stain, Warthin–Starry silver stain, acridine orange stain, and phase-contrast microscopy. It is capable of forming biofilms and can convert from spiral to a possibly viable but nonculturable coccoid form.|$|E
5|$|Howard Steer observes <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> from biopsies of {{a patient}} with ulcers.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer. Inflammation of the pyloric antrum {{is more likely to}} lead to duodenal ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus (body of the stomach) is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma. However, <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E

5|$|<b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination. Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer. Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E

5|$|This is a {{timeline}} {{of the events}} relating to the discovery that peptic ulcer disease and some cancers are caused by <b>H.</b> <b>pylori.</b> In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that peptic ulcer disease (PUD) was primarily caused by Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium with affinity for acidic environments, such as the stomach. As a result, PUD {{that is associated with}} <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> is currently treated with antibiotics used to eradicate the infection. For 30 years prior to their discovery, it was widely believed that PUD was caused by excess acid in the stomach. During this time, acid control was the primary method of treatment for PUD, to only partial success; among other effects, it is now known that acid suppression alters the stomach milieu to make it less amenable to <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> infection.|$|E

5|$|A. Stone Freedberg {{begins a}} study to look for {{bacteria}} in the human stomach at Beth Israel Hospital. He finds <b>H.</b> <b>pylori.</b> It is rumored that others cannot reproduce the results, although no negative results are published.|$|E
5|$|<b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> is microaerophilic—that is, it {{requires}} oxygen, but at lower concentration {{than in the}} atmosphere. It contains a hydrogenase that can produce energy by oxidizing molecular hydrogen (H2) made by intestinal bacteria. It produces oxidase, catalase, and urease.|$|E
5|$|Kussmaul {{suggests}} using bismuth compounds, an antibacterial agent, {{to treat}} peptic ulcers (bismuth subsalicylate {{has since been}} used in many commercial drugs, including Pepto Bismol as part of antibacterial <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> treatment). The antibacterial properties of bismuth were not known until much later.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{intentionally}} consumes <b>H.</b> <b>pylori.</b> Like Marshall, {{he becomes}} ill, but unlike Marshall, {{he is not}} completely cured by antibiotics. The infection will remain with him for three years.|$|E
5|$|Motility. <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> {{has four}} to six flagella at the same spot; all gastric and {{enterohepatic}} Helicobacter species are highly motile owing to flagella. The characteristic sheathed flagellar filaments of Helicobacter are composed of two copolymerized flagellins, FlaA and FlaB.|$|E
5|$|Rauws and Tytgat {{describe}} cure of {{duodenal ulcer}} by eradication of <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> using Borody's triple therapy combination. Triple-therapy, modernized to a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics, soon becomes first line therapy for eradication.|$|E
5|$|The {{strain of}} <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> {{a person is}} exposed to may {{influence}} {{the risk of developing}} gastric cancer. Strains of <b>H.</b> <b>pylori</b> that produce high levels of two proteins, vacuolating toxin A (VacA) and the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), appear to cause greater tissue damage than those that produce lower levels or that lack those genes completely. These proteins are directly toxic to cells lining the stomach and signal strongly to the immune system that an invasion is under way. As a result of the bacterial presence, neutrophils and macrophages set up residence in the tissue to fight the bacteria assault.|$|E
