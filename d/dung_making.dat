The walls are made of a mixture of branches, earth and cow <b>dung,</b> <b>making</b> a Red Ochre background for the wall paintings. The Warli use only white for their paintings. Their white pigment {{is a mixture of}} rice paste and water with gum as a binding. They use a bamboo stick chewed at the end to make it as supple as a paintbrush. The wall paintings are done only for special occasions such as weddings or harvests. The lack of regular artistic activity explains the very crude style of their paintings, which were the preserve of the womenfolk until the late 1970s. But in the 1970s this ritual art took a radical turn, when Jivya Soma Mashe and his son Balu Mashe started to paint, not for any special ritual, but because of his artistic pursuits. Warli painting also featured in Coca-Cola's 'Come home on Diwali' ad campaign in 2010 was a tribute to the spirit of India’s youth and a recognition of the distinct lifestyle of the Warli tribe of Western India.|$|E

40|$|The {{surge in}} the urban {{population}} evident in most developing countries is a worldwide phenomenon, and often the result of drought, conflicts, poverty {{and the lack of}} education opportunities. In parallel with the growth of the cities is the growing need for food which leads to the burgeoning expansion of urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA). In this context, urban agriculture (UA) contributes significantly to supplying local markets with both vegetable and animal produce. As an income generating activity, UA also contributes to the livelihoods of poor urban dwellers. In order to evaluate the nutrient status of urban soils in relation to garden management, this study assessed nutrient fluxes (inputs and outputs) in gardens on urban Gerif soils {{on the banks of the}} River Nile in Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. To achieve this objective, a preliminary baseline survey was carried out to describe the structure of the existing garden systems. In cooperation with the author of another PhD thesis (Ms. Ishtiag Abdalla), alternative uses of cow <b>dung</b> in brick <b>making</b> kilns in urban Khartoum were assessed; and the socio-economic criteria of the brick kiln owners or agents, economical and plant nutritional value of animal dung and the gaseous emission related to brick making activities were assessed. A total of 40 household heads were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire to collect information on demographic, socio-economic and migratory characteristics of the household members, the gardening systems used and the problems encountered in urban gardening. Based on the results of this survey, gardens were divided into three groups: mixed vegetable-fodder gardens, mixed vegetable-subsistence livestock gardens and pure vegetable gardens. The results revealed that UA is the exclusive domain of men, 80 % of them non-native to Khartoum. The harvested produce in all gardens was market oriented and represented the main source of income for 83 % of the gardeners. Fast growing leafy vegetables such as Jew’s mallow (Corchorous olitorius L.), purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) and rocket (Eruca sativa Mill.) were the dominant cultivated species. Most of the gardens (95 %) were continuously cultivated throughout the year without any fallow period, unless they were flooded. Gardeners were not generally aware of the importance of crop diversity, which may help them overcome the strongly fluctuating market prices for their produce and thereby strengthen the contributions of UA to the overall productivity of the city. To measure nutrient fluxes, four gardens were selected and their nutrients inputs and outputs flows were monitored. In each garden, all plots were monitored for quantification of nutrient inputs and outputs. To determine soil chemical fertility parameters in each of the studied gardens, soil samples were taken from three selected plots at the beginning of the study in October 2007 (gardens L 1, L 2 and H 1) and in April 2008 (garden H 2) and at the end of the study period in March 2010. Additional soil sampling occurred in May 2009 to assess changes in the soil nutrient status after the River Nile flood of 2008 had receded. Samples of rain and irrigation water (river and well-water) were analyzed for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and carbon (C) content to determine their nutrient inputs. Catchment traps were installed to quantify the sediment yield from the River Nile flood. To quantify the nutrient inputs of sediments, samples were analyzed for N, P, K and organic carbon (Corg) content, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the particle size distribution. The total nutrient inputs were calculated by multiplying the sediment nutrient content by total sediment deposits on individual gardens. Nutrient output in the form of harvested yield was quantified at harvest of each crop. Plant samples from each field were dried, and analyzed for their N, P, K and Corg content. Cumulative leaching losses of mineral N and P were estimated in a single plot in garden L 1 from December 1 st 2008 to July 1 st 2009 using 12 ion exchange resins cartridges. Nutrients were extracted and analyzed for nitrate (NO 3 [...] N), ammonium (NH 4 +-N) and phosphate PO 4 - 3 -P. Changes in soil nutrient balance were assessed as inputs minus outputs. The results showed that across gardens, soil N and P concentrations increased from 2007 to 2009, while particle size distribution remained unchanged. Sediment loads and their respective contents of N, P and Corg decreased significantly (P < 0. 05) from the gardens of the downstream lowlands (L 1 and L 2) to the gardens of the upstream highlands (H 1 and H 2). No significant difference was found in K deposits. None of the gardens received organic fertilizers and the only mineral fertilizer applied was urea (46 - 0 - 0). This equaled 29, 30, 54, and 67 % of total N inputs to gardens L 1, L 2, H 1, and H 2, respectively. Sediment deposits of the River Nile floods contributed on average 67, 94, 6 and 42 % to the total N, P, K and C inputs in lowland gardens and 33, 86, 4 and 37 % of total N, P, K and C inputs in highland gardens. Irrigation water and rainfall contributed substantially to K inputs representing 96, 92, 94 and 96 % of total K influxes in garden L 1, L 2, H 1 and H 2, respectively. Following the same order, total annual DM yields in the gardens were 26, 18, 16 and 1. 8 t ha- 1. Annual leaching losses were estimated to be 0. 02 kg NH 4 +-N ha- 1 (SE = 0. 004), 0. 03 kg NO 3 [...] N ha- 1 (SE = 0. 002) and 0. 005 kg PO 4 - 3 -P ha- 1 (SE = 0. 0007). Differences between nutrient inputs and outputs indicated negative nutrient balances for P and K and positive balances of N and C for all gardens. The negative balances in P and K call for adoptions of new agricultural techniques such as regular manure additions or mulching which may enhance the soil organic matter status. A quantification of fluxes not measured in our study such as N 2 -fixation, dry deposition and gaseous emissions of C and N would be necessary to comprehensively assess the sustainability of these intensive gardening systems. The second part of the survey dealt with the brick making kilns. A total of 50 brick kiln owners/or agents were interviewed from July to August 2009, using a semi-structured questionnaire. The data collected included general information such as age, family size, education, land ownership, number of kilns managed and/or owned, number of months that kilns were in operation, quantity of inputs (cow dung and fuel wood) used, prices of inputs and products across the production season. Information related to the share value of the land on which the kilns were built and annual income for urban farmers and annual returns from dung for the animal raisers was also collected. Using descriptive statistics, budget calculation and Gini coefficient, the results indicated that renting the land to brick making kilns yields a 5 -fold higher return than the rent for agriculture. Gini coefficient showed that the kiln owners had a more equal income distribution compared to farmers. To estimate emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and losses of N, P, K, Corg and DM from cow dung when used in brick making, samples of cow dung (loose and compacted) were collected from different kilns and analyzed for their N, P, K and Corg content. The procedure modified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 1994) was used to estimate the gaseous emissions of cow dung and fuel wood. The amount of deforested wood was estimated according to the default values for wood density given by Dixon et al. (1991) and the expansion ratio for branches and small trees given by Brown et al. (1989). The data showed the monetary value of added N and P from cow dung was lower than for mineral fertilizers. Annual consumption of compacted dung (381 t DM) as biomass fuel by far exceeded the consumption of fuel wood (36 t DM). Gaseous emissions from cow dung and fuel wood were dominated by CO 2, CO and CH 4. Considering that Gerif land in urban Khartoum supports a multifunctional land use system, efficient use of natural resources (forest, dung, land and water) will enhance the sustainability of the UA and brick making activities. Adoption of new kilns with higher energy efficiency will reduce the amount of biomass fuels (cow dung and wood) used the amount of GHGs emitted and the threat to the few remaining forests. Der Bevölkerungsanstieg in Städten von Entwicklungsländern ist ein globales Phänomen und wird durch Trockenheit, kriegerische Auseinandersetzungen, Armut und Mangel an Ausbildungsmöglichkeiten beeinflusst. Mit dem Wachstum der Städte steigt gleichzeitig auch der Bedarf an Nahrungsmitteln, was zu einer Ausbreitung städtischer und stadtnaher Landwirtschaft (Englisch: UPA) führt. In diesem Zusammenhang trägt städtische Landwirtschaft (Englisch: UA) maßgeblich zur Versorgung der örtlichen Märkte mit Gemüse und tierischen Produkten bei. Die Erlöse aus UA dienen damit vor allem als Lebensgrundlage ärmerer, städtischer Bewohner. Um die Nährstoffbedingungen von städtischen Böden in Bezug zu deren Bewirtschaftung zu beurteilen, wurden Nährstoffflüsse (Ein- und Austräge) in Gärten der städtischen Gerif-Böden entlang des Nils in Khartoum, der Hauptstadt Sudans untersucht. Um diesem Ziel gerecht zu werden, wurde eine Voruntersuchung zur Struktur der vorhandenen Anbausysteme durchgeführt. In Zusammenarbeit mit einer anderen Doktorandin (Frau Ishtiag Abdalla), wurden alternative Nutzungen von Kuhdung in der Backsteinproduktion bewertet; ebenso wurden sozio-ökonomische Kriterien der Brennofenbesitzer und -betreiber, der ökonomische und pflanzlich-nährstoffliche Wert von Tierdung und auch Gasemissionen aus der Backsteinproduktion beurteilt.
