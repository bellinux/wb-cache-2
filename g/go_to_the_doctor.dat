5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she was asked if she had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not want to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor.</b> She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E
500|$|In a {{rare case}} of {{survival}} without treatment, American professional photographer Mark Laita was bitten {{on the leg}} by a black mamba during a photo-shoot of a black mamba at a facility in Central America. The bite ruptured an artery in his calf, which bled profusely. Laita did not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> or the hospital, and except for the swollen fang marks giving him intense pain during the night, he was not affected and was fine physically. This led him to believe that either the snake gave him a [...] "dry bite" [...] (a bite without injecting venom) or the heavy bleeding pushed the venom out. Some commenters on the story suggested {{that it was a}} venomoid snake (in which the venom glands are surgically removed), but Laita responded that it was not. Only later did Laita find that he had captured the snake biting his leg in a photograph.|$|E
500|$|The actress went on {{to explain}} that the storyline showed how Toyah regretted her actions and that young female viewers could learn from her mistake. She added [...] "Anyone {{watching}} can see Dobber is just using Toyah and I hope the message gets across to other girls not to fall into the same trap." [...] Toyah did not use protection with Dobber, so her sister, Leanne, persuaded her to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> for the morning-after pill. Taylor praised Leanne for being Toyah's [...] "conscience and the voice of common sense". She thought that Leanne had given her good and responsible advice {{on how to deal with}} what happened. The Daily Record's John Millar agreed with Taylor and wrote that the storyline was [...] "building to a stark warning for the millions of teenagers tuning into the Street." [...] Millar believed at no time did the viewers get the impression that Toyah was doing something [...] "admirable" [...] and proclaimed that Toyah was [...] "the sort of girl who needs care and affection, which explains why the poor soul was coaxed into losing her virginity after a holiday romance convinced her that she was in love." ...|$|E

His son Felix Flying Hawk, and later his grandson David Flying Hawk, had been cheated and jailed by the white man for stealing their own horses. Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, his family and friends, had been assassinated. He had been placed on public exhibition as a specimen of the vanishing race to escape the poverty and constraints an Indian reservation. [...] "He stroked his breast {{to show that he}} was poorly dressed. He was still wearing a coat and vest which had been given to him by the host on a previous visit. He said that if he had what was due him from the Government he could dress like other people, and have plenty to eat all the time, much of the time he was hungry and could not buy medicine or <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> when sick." [...] On March 5, 1929, at age seventy-five, Flying Hawk made his last visit to The Wigwam in Du Bois, Pennsylvania. He had been traveling with the circus, and the pony riding, war dances and inclement weather were weighing on his health. The Wigwam was good medicine. [...] At The Wigwam he would could have fresh air, good food, rest and home comforts. Chief Flying Hawk died at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, December 24, 1931, at the age of 77 in want. He had written that during the previous winter of 1930-31 his little band was saved from starvation only through contributions from Gutzon Borglum and the American Red Cross. Sadly, it was rumored that Chief Flying Hawk died of starvation.|$|E
