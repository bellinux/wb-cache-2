5|$|Stalin's office {{records show}} {{meetings}} at which Khrushchev was present {{as early as}} 1932. The two increasingly built a good relationship. Khrushchev greatly admired the dictator and treasured informal meetings with him and invitations to Stalin's dacha, while Stalin <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> affection for his young subordinate.|$|E
2500|$|Legend says in {{the early}} 16th century, the local Osage Indians were on a bear hunt, chasing two black bears along the White River until one went up a tree for safety. But a well placed arrow took it out. [...] They {{continued}} to chase the other bear up Roark Mountain, and the bear fell onto a ledge in the sinkhole. The hunting party didn't want to all jump down to kill the bear and have to drag it back up so, a brave young tribe member climbed down to the ledge with his hunting dog and knife. He stabbed the bear and the bear lunged back. The bear, dog and the boy fell through the sinkhole landing in the Cathedral Room. The Indians then looked down the hole and saw nothing. They heard strange sounds; echoing sounds of their voices, bats flying around, water trickling and they <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> air, all of which made them {{think it was an}} evil place. The Indians thought they had found the entrance to Hades and named the cave the Devil's Den. [...] They marked trees around the Devil's Den with their danger sign (a sideways V), and never returned.|$|E
6000|$|A hand {{slipped into}} his--small, soft, trembling, exquisitely thrilling. Neale became {{still as a}} stone--transfixed. He knew that touch. No dream, no fancy, no morbid visitation! He <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> flesh--tender, {{clinging}} fingers; and then the pulse of blood that beat of hope--love--life--Allie Lee! ...|$|E
60|$|The baker {{took the}} hot beverage. This much of good he might at least allow himself. He drank it, and he <b>felt</b> <b>warmed.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I know, gelatines;" [...] {{and disappearing}} into a sweetstuff shop, {{returned}} with quite a quantity. With these, first sucked till glutinous, we joined my many tatters. I still attracted attention, but <b>felt</b> <b>warmer.</b>|$|R
60|$|Garnache {{thought of}} other things besides the weather {{that he had found}} indifferent, and he <b>felt</b> <b>warmed</b> {{almost to the point of}} anger at the very recollection. But he bowed again, and {{answered}} amiably enough.|$|R
60|$|He {{stretched}} out his hand upon the rock beside him. It <b>felt</b> <b>warm.</b> That was the island's personal temperature when in its afternoon sleep as now. He listened, and heard sounds: whirr-whirr, saw-saw-saw. Those were the island's snores--the noises of the quarrymen and stone-sawyers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Get on this," [...] cried Graham's conductor, {{and thrust}} him {{forward to a}} long grating of snowless metal that ran like a band between two {{slightly}} sloping expanses of snow. It <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> to Graham's benumbed feet, and a faint eddy of steam rose from it.|$|E
6000|$|And Gene said, [...] "Well, why didn't you?" [...] and Claire laughed, and {{her toes}} <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> and pink and good, {{and she was}} {{perfectly}} happy, and she murmured, [...] "It {{would be good to}} hear a decent violinist again. Oh! What had George Worlicht been doing, when you were home?" ...|$|E
40|$|In humans, alcohol {{consumption}} {{has been shown}} to cause heat loss by inducing cutaneous vasodilation and skin blood flow increase resulting in a decrease in skin and body temperatures, particularly during cold expo-sure. These results are consistent with the subjective feeling of being less cold during exposure to cold air under alcohol intoxication. Other reports indicated that the subjects <b>felt</b> <b>warmer</b> and more comfortable afte...|$|R
60|$|Bertrade flushed, {{and then}} {{bit her lip}} as she <b>felt</b> the <b>warm</b> blood mount to her cheek.|$|R
60|$|Muriel {{came forward}} with outstretched hands, and in another moment Austin, to his visible embarrassment, <b>felt</b> her <b>warm</b> grasp.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{had been}} {{carrying}} his coat upon his arm. He had <b>felt</b> <b>warm,</b> even hot, and had {{imagined that the}} steady walk had occasioned it. But his skin was cool. The heat came from an inward burning. He stopped the horse and raised the coat up, and helped Mercedes put it on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so {{fast as a}} {{crawling}} beetle {{tangled in}} the grass," [...] answered Nostromo, and his voice seemed deadened by the thick veil of obscurity that <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> and hopeless all about them. There were long periods when he made no sound, invisible and inaudible {{as if he had}} mysteriously stepped out of the lighter.|$|E
6000|$|His voice {{died within}} him, for now his outward sensations quickened. He <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> tears falling on his cheeks; he felt {{embracing}} arms clasped round him; he heard tenderly repeated, 'Father! {{speak to me}} as you were wont; love me, father, and forgive me, as you loved and forgave me when I was a little child!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph! Must {{take me for}} an Indian!" [...] muttered Pepper. Nevertheless, {{he wrapped}} the {{blankets}} around him and then <b>felt</b> considerably <b>warmer.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Since {{sitting down}} he had <b>felt</b> curiously <b>warm.</b> 'Smee,' he said, 'this seat is hot.' He jumped up. 'Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I'm burning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Going out?" [...] Jacob Welse {{asked him}} {{on a day when}} the {{meridian}} sun for the first time <b>felt</b> faintly <b>warm</b> to the naked skin.|$|R
60|$|The cold, steely, darkling {{sweep of}} desert had been transformed. It {{was now a}} world of red earth and gold rocks and purple sage, with {{everywhere}} the endless straggling green cedars. A breeze whipped in, making the fire roar softly. The sun <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> on his cheek. And {{at the moment he}} heard the whistle of his horse.|$|E
60|$|But {{now they}} must have become angered by the {{continuous}} noise and excited {{by the smell of}} new blood, for all of a sudden a great form shot from a clump of low shrubbery into the midst of a struggling mass of humanity. A horrid scream of bestial rage broke from the banth as he <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> flesh beneath his powerful talons.|$|E
60|$|It {{was the way}} {{she said}} it. He <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> all over, and in his heart and head. He gave her a quick, searching look, {{involuntary}} and serious, and for the moment that her eyes met his steadily, ere they fell, {{it seemed to him that}} he read something of vaster import than the claim Cyrus Johnson had failed to record.|$|E
6000|$|She put {{her face}} closer to his. She <b>felt</b> the <b>warm</b> {{nearness}} of his. [...] "DON'T!" [...] she said, and wrenched her wrist from his retaining hand.|$|R
60|$|The months went on--winter passing to spring--and {{the slow}} decking {{of the trees}} and fields began with leaves and flowers, with {{butterflies}} and the songs of birds. How far the little cowman would notice such a thing as that no one could ever have said, devoid as he was of the vocabulary of beauty, but like all the world his heart must have <b>felt</b> <b>warmer</b> and lighter under his old waistcoat, and perhaps more than most hearts, for he could often be seen standing stock-still in the fields, his browning face turned to the sun.|$|R
60|$|The play-hour in {{the evening}} I thought the pleasantest {{fraction}} of the day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five o'clock had revived vitality, {{if it had not}} satisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom <b>felt</b> <b>warmer</b> than in the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} for a moment. He hesitated. He very much wanted to go upstairs to get into dry clothing. But there was another desire in him. And she seemed to hold him. His will seemed to have gone to sleep, and left him, {{standing}} there slack before her. But he <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> inside himself. He did not shudder at all, though his clothes were sodden on him.|$|E
60|$|The wall <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> to {{her back}} and shoulders, and she found that {{immediately}} within the gable was the cottage fireplace, the heat of which came through the bricks. She warmed her hands upon them, and also put her cheek--red and moist with the drizzle--against their comforting surface. The wall {{seemed to be the}} only friend she had. She had so little wish to leave it that she could have stayed there all night.|$|E
6000|$|OSWALD [...] Your couch, I fear, good Baron, [...] Has been but comfortless; and {{yet that}} place, [...] When the tempestuous wind first drove us hither, [...] <b>Felt</b> <b>warm</b> as a wren's nest. You'd better turn [...] And under covert rest till break of day, [...] Or till the storm abate. [...] (To MARMADUKE aside.) He has {{restored}} you. [...] No doubt you have been nobly entertained? [...] But soft!--how came he forth? The Night-mare Conscience [...] Has driven him out of harbour? ...|$|E
6000|$|She <b>felt</b> a <b>warm</b> {{flush of}} {{pleasure}} in his boldness. [...] "I don't know. It's like it; that's the way I've always seen it; and it's beautiful. But somehow----" ...|$|R
6000|$|Since {{sitting down}} he had <b>felt</b> curiously <b>warm.</b> [...] "Smee," [...] he said, [...] "this seat is hot." [...] He jumped up. [...] "Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I'm burning." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the lesser}} {{and the greater}} scamp looked at each other, {{and for a moment}} or two <b>felt</b> a <b>warm,</b> sympathetic, {{friendly}} emotion for each other, and quietly shook hands.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{very bright}} day. The sky and water were both of the same deep hue; and the air <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> and sunny; so that we threw off our jackets. I could hardly believe that I was sailing in the same ship I had been in during the night, when every thing had been so lonely and dim; and I could hardly imagine {{that this was the}} same ocean, now so {{beautiful}} and blue, that during part of the night-watch had rolled along so black and forbidding.|$|E
60|$|The unhampered horses led the way; the pack-animals trotted after them; {{the riders}} were close behind. All {{traveled}} at a jog-trot. And this gait made the packs bob {{up and down}} and from side to side. The sun <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> at Helen's back and the wind lost its frosty coldness, that almost appeared damp, for a dry, sweet fragrance. Dale drove up the shallow valley that showed timber on the levels above and a black border of timber some few miles ahead. It did not take long to reach the edge of the forest.|$|E
6000|$|All {{the heat}} from that fire, they told me, was going up the chimney. I {{did not like to}} answer them that {{notwithstanding}} I <b>felt</b> <b>warm</b> and cosy. I feared it might be merely British stupidity that kept me warm and cosy, not the fire at all. How could it be the fire? The heat from the fire was going up the chimney. It was the glow of ignorance that was making my toes tingle. Besides, if by sitting close {{in front of the fire}} and looking hard at it, I did contrive, by hypnotic suggestion, maybe, to fancy myself warm, what should I feel like at the other end of the room? ...|$|E
60|$|My heart {{stood still}} for a moment, and then gave a great throb as I <b>felt</b> the <b>warm</b> clasp of her hands and the tremulous touch of her lips upon my forehead.|$|R
5000|$|Keith Phipps of The Onions A.V. Club said, [...] "The {{novelty of}} {{watching}} De Niro and Pacino team up wears off pretty quickly, them trudging through a thriller {{that would have}} <b>felt</b> <b>warmed</b> over in 1988. Director Jon Avnet doesnt offer much compensation for the absent suspense." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film two stars (out of four), saying: [...] "This isnt just generic material; its generic material with a dumb ending, and the director is a journeyman, not a craftsman. ... Its failure {{to live up to}} even modest expectations is a blow. Theres nothing righteous to be found here." ...|$|R
60|$|She did, bestriding {{the back}} of the middle seat and {{dropping}} at his side. The magnetic fingers again touched his; he <b>felt</b> her <b>warm</b> breath on his neck as she bent toward him.|$|R
