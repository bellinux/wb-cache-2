As of 2010, along with other US security allies including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea in the Asia-Pacific region with Taiwan Relations Act, officials of the ROC have gained quasi-official level visits to the United States both in the governmental and political level, including the US-Taiwan cooperative military guidance in the annual Han Kuang joint-force exercises. The Common Strategic Objectives of Joint Statement of the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee of 2005 and 2011 (and reiterated in 2013) included to encourage the peaceful resolution of issues concerning the Taiwan Strait through dialogue and encourage China’s responsible and constructive role in regional stability and prosperity, its cooperation on global issues, and its adherence to international norms of behavior, while building trust among the United States, Japan, and China.

40|$|In the post- 2008 global {{financial}} crisis era, the <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance</b> system has experienced dramatic changes and a comparatively new network system {{comes into the}} fore. Meanwhile, China’s extraordinary performance during the crisis {{by virtue of its}} unique political and economic systems urged the elevation of its role in the new system. Against this backdrop, three words are appropriate to describe the new system and China’s role in it in the post-crisis era-centripetalism (rather than centrifugalism), elevation (rather than domination) and disparity (rather than coherence). Centripetalism means that patched <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance</b> network system has more force to coordinate states and related international organizations. Elevation refers to a relatively more important role of China in the new system, but, by no means, a dominant (or hegemonic) role. China is an indispensable participant rather than a leading power in <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance.</b> Disparity indicates the differed strategies of China in various <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance</b> institutions or toward different events...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} of the <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance</b> {{system is a}} history of {{the rise and fall of}} the Western advanced countries in the post-war international political and economic system. Since the end of the Second World War, the International Monetary Foundation and the World Bank have always taken the dominant role in the field of <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance.</b> However, after the beginning of the global financial crisis in 2008, many drawbacks have become apparent concerning these two significant institutions, such as the lack of representatives, the slow and ineffective response to the crisis, etc. Following a strong appeal from the developing countries (with the emerging powers as their representatives), the <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance</b> system has experienced several rounds of reforms which have yet to yield acceptable results. Therefore, it is highly necessary to create a new institution which can play a complementary role in the existing financial governance system rather than overthrow it. Complying with the tide of history, the official establishment of the BRICS Bank can be of great significance to the reform of current <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance</b> systems such as diversifying the <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance</b> bodies, representing the interests of developing countries in a better way, enhancing the status and improving the importance of emerging economies in the international political and economic order.

50|$|In April 2010, the Minister for Financial Services, Chris Bowen, {{announced}} the Government's {{response to the}} inquiry.

The article defends three propositions implying a serious challenge to political legitimacy in contemporary financial governance: i) external financial constraints conflict with a range of potential domestic, particularly democratic, political imperatives; ii) developed state initiated <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> integration strengthens private interests in the policy process, narrowing the definition of the public interest in a democratic context; iii) market-friendly institutional reforms put pressure on domestic socio-political arrangements underpinning longer run political legitimacy.

The purpose of this article is to investigate whether the crisis spawned a role for civil society in <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance.</b> This issue is important because by realising the role civil society plays, we grasp how they help to improve the highly flawed financial architecture.

40|$|In {{the half}} decade {{following}} the 2007 financial crisis, {{the reform of}} <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance</b> was driven by two separate policy debates; one on the substantive content of regulations, {{the other on the}} organizational architecture of their governance. The separation of the two debates among policymakers has been mirrored in academia, where post-crisis analyses of financial governance have remained detached from reinvigorated discussions about the nature of financial markets. We argue this separation is deeply flawed. Presenting an analysis of interactions between standards for banking, credit rating, accounting and derivatives trading, this article demonstrates why the appropriateness of the organizational architecture of <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance</b> is necessarily contingent upon one’s understanding of how financial markets work. In particular, if financial markets are not anchored to external "economic fundamentals" but instead demonstrate reflexivity, the reciprocal interactions between different regulatory arenas demand considerably more organizational coordination than is presently the case...|$|E

40|$|Accounting {{standards}} are {{the foundations of}} the financial regulatory edifice, and <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance</b> is no more stable than the asset valuations that feed it. Yet for two decades and up to this day, no international accounting rule for financial instruments - the bulk of banks' balance sheets - has emerged that was more than a temporary fix, to be succeeded by further reforms. We show how banking regulators have been central to this dynamic and how their support for applying fair value accounting to financial instruments, the cornerstone of regulatory debate, has oscillated throughout the whole period. The two common IPE approaches to <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance,</b> which analyze it either as interest-based bargaining or as ideas-driven expert governance, fail to account for this pattern.

40|$|If {{we want to}} {{understand}} how we might enhance the legitimacy of global governance, we need to first {{understand the nature of}} contemporary legitimacy deficits and how certain global governance practices undermine levels of legitimacy.

40|$|As {{reforms to}} the <b>global</b> {{economic}} and <b>financial</b> systems are undertaken, a high-level panel has recommended that a body to observe <b>global</b> economic and <b>financial</b> <b>governance</b> {{to be established}} with UNCTAD as custodian to safeguard the interests of poor countries. This document focuses on how UNCTAD can adapt and play an effective role representing the interests of less-wealthy nations as the global economy changes, driven by rapid technological advances, lengthening supply chains for products, and ever-greater flows of money and resources across borders. It also reflects a shift in perspective advocated by the organization in recent years towards “development-centred globalization. ”On the proposed Development Observatory of <b>Global</b> Economic and <b>Financial</b> <b>Governance,</b> the panel notes that such an observatory would analyze all major suggested changes to the <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> and economic architecture, assess their impact on sustainable development and inclusive growth, and make recommendations to address any shortcomings. The panel proposes {{that this could be}} based on developing indicators for "development-centered" globalization, and periodically using them to assess the impacts of globalization. "The Observatory would be an effective assessment tool independent from policy-setting processes. ” It adds, “In fulfilling this role under its development mission and mandate, UNCTAD could also strive to increase its cooperation with the World Bank and the IMF, especially in relation to policies that affect developing countries. ”The suggested “multilateral platform where international investment policies can be coordinated” would be a response to “the systemic complexity and incoherence of the current regime” of international investment agreements, the report says. “A more coordinated approach to global investment relations is needed if we are to (i) stimulate investment for growth and jobs; (ii) make investment work for sustainable development; (iii) avoid protectionism; and (iv) ensure policy coherence at the national and international levels and create synergies between investment policies and other policies, such as those for trade, finance, competition, or the environment. ”Among additional recommendations contained in the report is establishment of an “aid-for diversification facility” to help poor countries reduce their economic dependence on commodities exports. An accompanying “aid for diversification programme” could offer “support that commodity-dependent, low-income countries need to successfully diversify their economies, both horizontally and vertically,” the study says. “Such a facility would not only provide funding, but also help through technology and human resource development, including providing advice on the utilization of funds and job creation. ”The report, among other things, also recommends: Establishing “a multilateral and multi-stakeholder platform for fostering dialogue among regional trade blocs;”Developing “operational strategies for strengthening the productive capacity” of developing country businesses so that they can “become part of global supply chains and maximize the developmental benefits thereof;”Assessing “the economic development impact of migration;”Organizing a platform for retired professionals to volunteering their skills to poor countries;Setting up “an international technical assistance centre for green investment and technology”;Additional work by UNCTAD to “mainstream gender parity in the economic and development spheres;” andCarrying out further research on the informal economies of developing countries and the establishment of a “platform” to “provide technical assistance to facilitate the formalization of the informal sector. ” ...|$|R

In comparing reform cases across different time periods in the United States, Japan, and Germany, Sara Konoe stresses the role of dynamic interactions between institutions and political contexts in determining reform paths. In non-crisis periods, regulatory fragmentation is utilized by financial sectors to pursue their demands for liberalization, though those in self-regulating or monopolized markets resist the agenda of liberalization. A time of crisis empowers reformers to restructure the financial regulatory structure and markets and enables the tightening of regulation.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} process of policy {{preference}} formation in <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance</b> by examining {{the changing nature of}} supervision in the banking industry. The article argues that transparency and market-based supervision are now an integral and formal part of the supervision process, thus providing a public role to the private sector. The analysis focuses specifically at three levels of practice: official supervision {{in the context of the}} Basel process; private initiatives and voluntary frameworks of best practice standards; and informal market channels. The article shows that the private sector has used the above means to acquire supervision functions, thus altering the nature of supervision. The analysis highlights the costs and risks of active private sector involvement and calls for stronger accountability patterns and improved disclosure. In addition, it contrasts market-based supervisory arrangements with economic ideas about market discipline and shows that the mix of political and economic imperatives leads to a set-up where private financial institutions have the power of initiative but few incentives to fear market discipline. The article explains how and why private interests are internalised in financial policy processes and focuses on the existence of a transnational policy community of public and private participating actors who are in fundamental agreement about policy. The changing nature of supervision results from developments in global financial integration but also, the different ways in which <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> <b>governance</b> is generated...|$|E

The evolution of this list reflects shifting concerns among the central {{actors in the}} organisation, as well as representing a response to any ‘displacement’ activity undertaken by those seeking to avoid these forms of governance. When the scope for cooperation and compliance with the FATF Forty Recommendations was extended beyond the organisation’s membership this governance regime encountered business sectors and financial practices not readily amenable to its objectives. This paper considers the causes and consequences for the situation, as developing economy states attempt {{to comply with the}} global governance expectations of the FATF when {{a significant portion of the}} domestic economy operates ‘informally’. A frame of reference is provided, with a definition for the informal economy and the concept of displacement as used in research on criminal activity.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{inquires}} {{into the}} root causes of global imbalances from an international trade perspective. The purpose of the paper is to establish a conceptual framework that links <b>financial</b> market <b>governance,</b> international trade and financial market integration, and to derive implications for the <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> crisis. Design/methodology/approach – In order to analyze global imbalances, the paper draws on a theoretical Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson international trade model, in which it compares two open economies, solely differing in their <b>financial</b> market <b>governance</b> structures. Building on these findings, the paper extends the analysis to the role of financial market frictions in propagating global imbalances into excessive lending in high-income economies. Findings – To that extent, it argues that global imbalances are due to impasses in international production. This paper argues that countries seeking to suppress real appreciation have engaged in financial repression, which has, via financial globalization, translated into excessive expansion of financial service sectors in flexible market economies. Research limitations/implications – In order to derive a tractable framework, the abstract from inter-temporal aspects and from an in-depth analysis of financial modelling issues. Owing to the static nature of the set-up, the analytic link between global imbalances and the <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> crisis is intuitive. Practical implications – Given that differences in national <b>financial</b> market <b>governance</b> influence the direction of international capital and trade flows, it argues for more international policy coordination in preventing future crisis. Originality/value – The unique feature of the contribution is that it links <b>financial</b> market <b>governance</b> and international trade to international financial market integration in a tractable theoretical framework. <b>Financial</b> markets, <b>Governance,</b> Trade balances, World economy...|$|R
