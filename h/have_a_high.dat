5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} T.felleus <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> {{capacity}} to accumulate radioactive caesium (137Cs) from contaminated soil, a characteristic {{attributed to the}} deep soil penetration achieved by the mycelium. In contrast, the species has a limited capacity to accumulate the radioactive isotope 210Po.|$|E
5|$|I do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> {{opinion of}} North American and their motives {{in the early}} days. Their first program manager was a {{first-class}} jerk....

5|$|Massive main {{sequence}} stars can have surface temperatures of 50,000K. Smaller {{stars such as}} the Sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand K. Red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about 3,600K; but they also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> luminosity due to their large exterior surface area.|$|E

5|$|People with {{schizophrenia}} may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> rate of {{irritable bowel syndrome}} {{but they}} often do not mention it unless specifically asked.

5|$|The {{wings are}} powered directly, unlike most {{families}} of insects, with the flight muscles {{attached to the}} wing bases. Dragonflies <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> power/weight ratio, and have been documented accelerating at 4 G linearly and 9 G in sharp turns while pursuing prey.|$|E

5|$|Zirconium is {{relatively}} abundant in S-type stars, {{and it has}} been detected in the sun and in meteorites. Lunar rock samples brought back from several Apollo missions to the moon <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> zirconium oxide content relative to terrestrial rocks.|$|E
5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes often <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> enough {{center of}} mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined {{center of mass}} of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|As a result, it is {{both the}} {{percentage}} of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines {{the strength of the}} association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands. In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT Pribnow box in some promoters, tend to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.|$|E

5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{precipitation}} {{of sodium}} salts from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium salts typically <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> affinity for water; an exception is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3). Because of this, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic solvent, such as ethanol; for example, only 0.35g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol. Crown ethers, like 15-crown-5, {{may be used}} as a phase-transfer catalyst.|$|E
5|$|In New York, {{the city}} asked commuters to avoid driving unless necessary, and {{apartment}} buildings to stop incinerating their residents' garbage and turn heating down to 60°F (15°C). New Jersey and Connecticut asked their residents not to travel, {{and to use}} less power and heat. Although it was a workday, traffic was light in New York City. A check on 303 buildings of the New York City Housing Authority later found near-total cooperation with the city's requests. Private residences were believed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> rate of voluntary cooperation with the city's plea to cut energy consumption.|$|E

5|$|In many East Asian cultures, salt is not {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} condiment. In its place, condiments such as soy sauce, {{fish sauce}} and oyster sauce tend to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures. They are most often used for cooking rather than as table condiments.|$|E
5|$|In some cultures, insects, {{especially}} deep-fried cicadas, {{are considered}} to be delicacies, whereas in other places they form part of the normal diet. Insects <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> protein content for their mass, and some authors suggest their potential as a major source of protein in human nutrition. In most first-world countries, however, entomophagy (the eating of insects), is taboo.|$|E
