5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated <b>four-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E

25|$|In a {{two-stroke}} engine {{that uses a}} camshaft, each valve is opened once for every rotation of the crankshaft; in these engines, the camshaft rotates {{at the same speed}} as the crankshaft. In a <b>four-stroke</b> <b>engine,</b> the valves are opened only half as often; thus, two full rotations of the crankshaft occur for each rotation of the camshaft.|$|E
50|$|Recreational karts can be {{powered by}} <b>four-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> or {{electric}} motors, while racing karts use a two-stroke or, rarely, higher powered <b>four-stroke</b> <b>engines.</b> Most {{of them are}} single seater but some recreational models can accommodate a passenger.|$|R
50|$|<b>Four-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> are {{generally}} {{associated with a}} wider power band making for somewhat gentler power delivery, but technology such as reed valves and exhaust power-valve systems has improved ride-ability on two-strokes. Fuel economy is also better in four-strokes due to more complete combustion of the intake charge in <b>four-stroke</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1890, Daimler and Maybach {{together}} {{founded the}} Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft, the Daimler Motor Corporation or DMG for short, which {{was dedicated to}} the construction of small high speed internal combustion engines for land, water, or air transport. Maybach was Chief Designer. After spending long hours debating which fuel was best to use in Otto's <b>four-stroke</b> <b>engine,</b> which had normally used methane gas as a fuel, they turned to petroleum which until then had been used mainly as a cleaner and sold in pharmacies.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the California Motor Company {{was formed}} in 1901 to sell {{complete}} gasoline-engine motorbikes in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose. The company began with a 200cc single-cylinder, 1.5-horsepower, <b>four-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> designed by R.C. Marks. Mounted to a standard bicycle frame, the California could reach speeds of approximately 25mph (40km/h). The California weighed around 75-80 pounds, and featured a leading-link front fork, a leather spring saddle, a front Duck roller brake, and an Atherton rear coaster brake. A leathern belt-drive directly connected the engine output shaft to the rear wheel. During the summer of 1903, George A. Wyman rode a 200cc, 1.5-horsepower California from San Francisco to New York City, becoming {{the first person to}} cross the North American continent aboard a motor vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Four-stroke radials have an {{odd number}} of {{cylinders}} per row, so that a consistent every-other-piston firing order can be maintained, providing smooth operation. For example, on a five-cylinder engine the firing order is 1, 3, 5, 2, 4 and back to cylinder 1. Moreover, this always leaves a one-piston gap between the piston on its combustion stroke and the piston on compression. The active stroke directly helps compress the next cylinder to fire, making the motion more uniform. If an even {{number of cylinders}} were used, an equally timed firing cycle would not be feasible. The prototype radial Zoche aero-diesels (below) have an even number of cylinders, either four or eight; {{but this is not}} problematic, because they are two-stroke engines, with twice the number of power strokes as a <b>four-stroke</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{first of}} the Trabants left the VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau factory in Saxony on 7 November 1957. It was a {{relatively}} advanced car when it was formally introduced the following year, with front wheel drive, unitary construction and independent suspension. The Trabant's greatest shortcoming was its engine. By the late 1950s many small Western cars (such as the Renault) had cleaner, more-efficient four-stroke engines, but budgetary constraints and raw-materials shortages mandated an outdated (but inexpensive) two-stroke engine in the Trabant. It was technically equivalent to the West German Lloyd automobile, a similarly sized car with an air-cooled, two-cylinder <b>four-stroke</b> <b>engine.</b> The Trabant had a front, transversely-mounted engine and front-wheel drive {{in an era when}} many European cars were using rear-mounted engines or front-mounted engines with rear-wheel drive. Its greatest drawback was its largely unchanged production; the car's two-stroke engine made it obsolete by the 1970s, limiting exports to Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, the American bolt-on Whizzer gas-engined bicycle kit was introduced, {{utilizing}} a 138cc side-valve <b>four-stroke</b> <b>engine,</b> the first whizzer {{was of the}} friction drive variety, but was soon replaced with belt drive. Despite some initial engine reliability issues, the Whizzer enjoyed modest popularity during World War II due to fuel and automobile shortages, and was used by war plant workers and others with priority for transportation. After the war, the Whizzer became popular with youth who desired faster speeds from their heavy cruiser-framed Schwinn bicycles. In 1949, the company introduced a complete production bike, the Pacemaker. Sales of the Whizzer conversion kits continued until 1962. In the United Kingdom, the motorized bicycle saw a resurgence of popularity and such bolt-on motors as the Cyclaid and the Cyclemaster motor wheel saw brief periods of immense popularity. The Cyclemaster, which was a hub motor that could be fitted to an ordinary bike, started at 25cc (painted black), but later the size went up to 32cc (painted grey).|$|E
25|$|As {{the engine}} {{crankshaft}} turns, it also turns the distributor shaft at half the speed. In a <b>four-stroke</b> <b>engine,</b> the crankshaft turns twice for the ignition cycle. A multi-lobed cam {{is attached to}} the distributor shaft; there is one lobe for each engine cylinder. A spring-loaded rubbing block follows the lobed portions of the cam contour and controls the opening and closing of points. During most of the cycle, the rubbing block keeps the points closed to allow a current to build in the ignition coil's primary winding. As a piston reaches the top of the engine's compression cycle, the cam's lobe is high enough to cause the breaker points to open. Opening the points causes the current through the primary coil to stop. Without the steady current through the primary, the magnetic field generated in the coil immediately collapses. This high rate of change of magnetic flux induces a high voltage in the coil's secondary windings that ultimately causes the spark plug's gap to arc and ignite the fuel.|$|E

25|$|Wankel {{rotary engine}} and piston engine displacement, and {{corresponding}} power, output can more accurately be compared by displacement per {{revolution of the}} eccentric shaft. A calculation of this form dictates that a two-rotor Wankel displacing 654cc per face will have a displacement of 1.3 liters per every rotation of the eccentric shaft (only two total faces, one face per rotor going through a full power stroke) and 2.6 liters after two revolutions (four total faces, two faces per rotor going through a full power stroke). The results are directly comparable to a 2.6-liter piston engine with an even number of cylinders in a conventional firing order, which will likewise displace 1.3 liters through its power stroke after one revolution of the crankshaft, and 2.6 liters through its power strokes after two revolutions of the crankshaft. A Wankel rotary engine is still a <b>four-stroke</b> <b>engine,</b> and pumping losses from non-power strokes still apply, but the absence of throttling valves and a 50% longer stroke duration result in a significantly lower pumping loss compared to a four-stroke reciprocating piston engine. Measuring a Wankel rotary engine in this way more accurately explains its specific output, because the volume of its air fuel mixture put through a complete power stroke per revolution is directly responsible for torque, and thus the power produced.|$|E
