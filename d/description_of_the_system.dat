500|$|The mildly complex {{reciprocal}} skill {{system was}} generally praised, {{with a few}} exceptions. IGN, though finding the manual's <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> unclear, found the classes well balanced and well designed for all play styles. GameSpot found the system clear and sensible. PC Gamer, by contrast, found the system unbalanced, with combat privileged over other features. Computer Gaming World felt the system's privileging of combinations of single-handed combat weapons and shields over double-handed weapons unnecessarily exploitable, but appreciated the freedom offered by the broad skillset and action-dependent leveling. GameSpy gave strong commendation to the system, stating that [...] "The advancement system makes so much sense that it makes other games, even games set in the D world such as Baldur's Gate, look silly by comparison". Morrowinds combat system was poorly received by the gaming press. GameSpot characterized {{it as one of}} the game's major weak points and GameSpy devoted the majority of their review's minor complaints to it. The system was disparaged for its simplicity and for its tendency to bore.|$|E

2500|$|Since it is {{not written}} in terms of reactions, {{but in terms of}} more general [...] "reaction rules" [...] {{encompassing}} sets of reactions, this kind of specification is often called [...] "rule-based". This <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> in terms of modular rules relies on the assumption that only a subset of features or attributes are relevant for a particular reaction rule. Where this assumption holds, a set of reactions can be coarse-grained into one reaction rule. This coarse-graining preserves the important properties of the underlying reactions. For instance, if the reactions are based on chemical kinetics, so are the rules derived from them.|$|E

2500|$|Linear {{control theory}} – This applies to systems made of devices which obey the {{superposition}} principle, which means roughly that the output {{is proportional to}} the input. [...] They are governed by linear differential equations. [...] A major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time, called linear time invariant (LTI) systems. [...] These systems are amenable to powerful frequency domain mathematical techniques of great generality, such as the Laplace transform, Fourier transform, Z transform, Bode plot, root locus, and Nyquist stability criterion. [...] These lead to a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> using terms like bandwidth, frequency response, eigenvalues, gain, resonant frequencies, poles, and zeros, which give solutions for system response and design techniques for most systems of interest.|$|E
2500|$|Wave {{function}} collapse is {{a forced}} expression for whatever just happened {{when it becomes}} appropriate to replace the description of an uncertain state of a system by a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> in a definite state. [...] Explanations for {{the nature of the}} process of becoming certain are controversial. At any time before a photon [...] "shows up" [...] on a detection screen it can only be described by a set of probabilities for where it might show up. When it does show up, for instance in the CCD of an electronic camera, the time and the space where it interacted with the device are known within very tight limits. However, the photon has disappeared, and the wave function has disappeared with it. In its place some physical change in the detection screen has appeared, e.g., an exposed spot in a sheet of photographic film, or a change in electric potential in some cell of a CCD.|$|E
