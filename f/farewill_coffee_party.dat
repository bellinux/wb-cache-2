During this time, <b>Coffee</b> <b>Party</b> Facebook page administrators posted 872 parent posts that received 152, 762 comments from group members. Utilizing our previously established method (Mascaro 2 ̆ 6 Goggins, 2011) for extracting and analyzing electronic trace data, we constructed a weighted social network from the parent posts and associated comments. We measured network centralization and total post activity for the entire network and identified individuals with high betweenness centrality across three dimensions: 1) Time, 2) Parent Post Category and 3) Specific Parent Posts. We report three key findings. First, the structure, centralization and leadership within the network differ in four key time periods: the time preceding the midterm election, {{the week of the}} midterm election, the time immediately following the midterm election and the time period when the new Congress was sworn in. Second, the <b>Coffee</b> <b>Party</b> Administrators act as agenda setters with the parent posts, but show significant variation in their comment participation over time. Third, participants in the discourse alter their discourse role according to specific parent post and category. Our findings have implications for issue groups and candidates who utilize social media tools to mobilize support and engage with supporters...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{framework}} for examination of group formation and information exchange on a Facebook Group, “Join the <b>Coffee</b> <b>Party</b> Movement”, that was created {{in response to the}} Tea Party Movement in the US. The stated goals of “Join the <b>Coffee</b> <b>Party</b> Movement ” are to establish a place for otherwise disenfranchised individuals to share information and engage in productive dialogue and to develop solutions for problems facing the USA. Similar movements exist in other countries and social networking technology has been utilized to further the ideology and mobilize supporters of various national and international causes. Since its inception in January 2010, over 300, 000 Facebook members have become followers of the <b>Coffee</b> <b>Party.</b> The Group’s page has over 155, 000 discussion comments to official postings. Preliminary analysis of this dialogue suggests two intertwined avenues for investigation. First, {{it is clear that the}} <b>Coffee</b> <b>Party</b> Facebook page represents one virtual group through which many different virtual subgroups emerge from online discourse. Second, the groups that are emerging do so as a consequence of having a shared information need, which is fulfilled to some extent through participation in this group. These groups exhibit a certain type of completely online collaborative information behavior that we think warrants investigation from multiple perspectives. How members of online groups like these collaboratively seek information is of importance for this workshop; but we believe our broader perspective will be of interest.

The 2009-2010 Iranian election protests also demonstrated how social networking sites are making the mobilization of large numbers of people quicker and easier. Iranians were able to organize and speak out against the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by using sites such as Twitter and Facebook. This in turn prompted widespread government censorship of the web and social networking sites.|$|R
