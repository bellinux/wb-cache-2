40|$|This thesis illustrates, {{examines}} {{and explains}} {{a diversity of}} female responses to Evangelical religion in Kent and Northamptonshire between 1800 and 1850. Previously untapped archival sources are investigated producing fresh evidence of Evangelicalism in women's domestic and local experience. Special collections, parish records and various other documents are explored to establish the religious and social identities of women featuring most prominently in this study. Family background, socio-economic circumstances, local environment and childhood denominational influences are shown to have been of greatest significance in shaping the spiritual attitudes and activities of women discussed here individually, or collectively. Local traditions of belief were important and {{the historical development of}} Evangelical religion in specific parishes is traced. 	Female responses to Evangelicalism are considered not only in parochial, but also in broader religious, political, intellectual, geographical and social contexts of the period. This wide-ranging <b>enquiry</b> <b>points</b> to avenues of research that can bring something new to the local history of women and Evangelical religion. Chapter one concerns an Orthodox Anglican woman with a family history of ecclesiastical and civic service in Canterbury, whose antipathy towards Evangelicalism and its expansion in Kent is investigated from her correspondence. The second chapter focuses on women in a Northamptonshire family who provided a home for the Rev. Thomas Jones (of Creaton) for over fifty years. Letters and other substantial documents give insight into a household and locality significant as centres of Evangelical religion. Chapter three investigates female involvement with the Church Missionary Society, the British and Foreign Bible Society and other Evangelical activities in and around Creaton. The final chapter relates to a young lacemaker belonging to a Particular Baptist community in Northamptonshire established by noted Evangelicals. Analysis of some of her published poems and hymns reveals them openly expressive of Evangelicalism...|$|E
40|$|Regional trade {{agreements}} (RTAs) present opportunities for controlling technical {{barriers to trade}} (TBTs). Using key principles and provisions of the WTO Agreement on TBT as a yardstick for analysis, this paper examines whether and how eight major regional integration agreements within the African region address TBT issues. It finds that TBT are not an important issue in Sub-Saharan African RTAs. Only one of the 8 agreements surveyed refers explicitly to the WTO TBT Agreement. Existing provisions for eliminating TBT-related barriers or harmonising legitimate technical regulations are formulated mostly in broad and nonprescriptive terms. The paper describes concrete steps that parties to these RTAs have taken {{in order to reduce}} technical barriers. Such initiatives have been taken at the national level but can also involve collaboration between RTAs. Country case studies show that weak TBT infrastructure remains a handicap for businesses and governments and that, {{with the exception of the}} Southern African Development Cooperation (SADC), investment by regional economic communities (RECs) in institutional infrastructure related to TBT has not been significant. The paper describes in some detail relevant activities taking place within SADC which could serve as a best-practice model for other African regional agreements. Serious capacity constraints stand in the way of African countries taking on the challenge of reducing TBT barriers. Also, low local levels of living standards favour weak product standard, and this acts as a barrier to upgrading product standards for export markets. Amending TBT coverage in African RTAs, a review of performance of <b>enquiry</b> <b>points</b> and assistance with infrastructure modernisation are among a set of measures recommended for achieving better TBT policy alignment among countries of the region. trade barriers, standards, RTA, technical barriers to trade, technical regulations, Sub-Sahara Africa, technical barriers, FTA, Economic Community of West African States, East African Community, South African-EU Trade and Development Cooperation Agreement, South Africa, regional economic community, WTO Agreement on TBT, mutual recognition, West African Economic and Monetary Union, Kenya, Nigeria, regional {{trade agreements}}, TBT, conformity assessment procedures, harmonisation, free trade agreement, Central African Economic and Monetary Union, Southern African Development Community...|$|E
40|$|In the {{literature}} of International Relations the notion of coexistence is not understood as a question for world politics, despite the frequent irruption of issues of coexistence that constantly preoccupy international praxis. Rather, in theoretic terms coexistence is considered self-evidently as the composition of units, identified with co-presence in some spatial sense. This is evident, not from the explicit theorisation of coexistence as such, but from the ontological commitments of the discipline. The <b>enquiry</b> <b>points</b> toward the ontological centrality of the modern subject, whose key attributes are reason, self-mastery and control over others and itself, and which determines coexistence through 'a logic of composition. ' The logic of composition reduces the multifarious relations of self and other to mere co-presence of already constituted subjects, that is, it occludes the constitutive role of the other in coexistence and for the 'subject' itself. Illustrating the interplay of subjectivity, composition and heteronomy in Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan {{and the work of}} David Campbell, the thesis turns to the phenomenology of Martin Heidegger in order {{to gain access to the}} heteronomy of entities. In his account of Being-in-the-world, it is argued, can be found an 'optics of coexistence' which enables a factically adequate understanding of coexistence. Such an optics reveals the self, not as autonomous and masterful, but as other-determined in its everydayness, and as uniquely appropriating this heteronomy in its process of becoming-proper. Existential heteronomy 'unworks modern subjectivity'. In this way, it forms the basis for the self's ethical comportment, a self which is an opening to otherness, and enables the articulation of a 'politics of non-self-sufficiency,' as a point of departure away from the subjective politics of self-sufficiency. Moreover, the diclosure of heteronomy disturbs the determination of coexistence as composition and points to community constitution through critique. Through what is called 'critical mimesis' community comes into being through the deconstructive retrieve of past possibilities inherited from past generations in process which is inclusive and critical. This is an account of communal constitution which is productive also in an era of global transformations, concerned with the destabilising effects of'globalisation. '...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is a focused {{investigation of the}} use of digital production technologies by UK designer-makers. The Critical and Contextual Review begins by examining what is known about the UK designer-maker sector. It considers how making practices relate to history and theories of craft, exploring meanings of key concepts such as ‘skill’ and ‘productive autonomy’. It reviews contemporary digital craft practice, identifying it as a genre and examines both digital economy and digital tool-use trends, relating to craft. The methodology Chapter 3 explains how the pragmatic philosophical approach taken justifies the focus on investigations of experiential practice and the specific mixed methods adopted. A series of experiential case studies looking at emergent practice is analysed using grounded theory techniques and concludes that in using digital tools the maker’s vision is the animating force in an inherently collective endeavour. This chapter is followed by an in-depth practicebased investigation looking specifically at the collaborative potential facilitated by digital possibilities. Chapter 6 presents an analysis of professional views based on interviews that probe the range and extent of technical and creative collaborations. At each stage of the research a reflective <b>enquiry</b> <b>points</b> towards the next step and provides successive iterations of evidence. The thesis that emerges from evidence is the contribution to knowledge of this research. It is that a cross-fertilisation between craft and digital technologies produces a hybrid networked practice that can amount to a new type of technology-enabled and networked craft – Technepractice – in which ‘negotiated collective engagement’ is the driving characteristic. This presents a fundamental challenge to the constructed authenticity of productive autonomy in 20 th century studio craft practice. The animation of collective resources, from exteriorised skill embedded in technology to the expertise of technicians and machine operators and the use of digital data sources, requires a re-evaluation of the location and meaning of skill in digital craft practice. A full account of the digital ‘proposition’ for craft, both the opportunities and threats, places digital craft in the context of other digital creative industries and explores possibilities for extending practice from collaborations to digital business models...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} descriptive overview of {{issues related to}} trade and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, as observed during {{the implementation of the}} SPS Agreement. It aims to provide background information on activities in the WTO's SPS Committee during the period 1995 - 2001, determine the participation of different country groups, and help to identify issues that might warrant further investigation in the context of analysis on the trade and economic effects of SPS measures. Attendance at regular meetings of the SPS Committee has varied from 44 to 70 different delegations. Most OECD countries have always been represented. Yet, half to two-thirds of all WTO members, including a large number of developing country members, have not participated in the discussions at SPS Committee meetings. Indeed, 47 WTO members, including 43 developing countries, did not have a representative at any of the 12 meetings for which information on attendance is available. During regular meetings of the SPS Committee, a total of 105 specific trade concerns have been discussed. Raising an issue makes it possible for countries to attract attention to a particular concern, which might help to avoid disputes between trading partners or potential future trade problems. Of all the specific issues, 27 related to food safety, 38 to animal health, 37 to plant health, and 3 to other SPS issues. Specific trade concerns have been expressed about SPS measures in all 30 OECD countries, and in 18 non-OECD countries, including 15 developing countries. Conversely, 29 OECD countries and 38 non-OECD countries, including 35 developing countries, have raised issues or supported complaints about SPS practices of other WTO members. Fruits, vegetables, and flowers and livestock and livestock products were the product groups most often subject to concerns. In almost a third of all cases, at least a partial solution to the specific trade concern raised was subsequently reported to the SPS Committee. Yet, there might be a number of other concerns that have been resolved through technical exchanges between the affected parties, without this outcome being reported back to the WTO. Even though the transparency disciplines of the SPS Agreement are obligatory for WTO membership, not all countries have so far complied concerning the provision of information on national notification authorities and SPS <b>enquiry</b> <b>points.</b> All OECD countries have reported an enquiry point to the WTO since 1995 and designated notification authorities since 1997, but a significant number of developing countries had not provided this information by the end of 2001. Nevertheless, the number of countries submitting SPS notifications and the number of notified SPS measures increased considerably between 1995 and the end of 2001. All 30 OECD members and 49 non-OECD countries have submitted notifications, with {{more than two-thirds of the}} more than 2400 notified SPS measures being reported by OECD countries. More than half of the notified measures were intended to ensure food safety. Up to the end of 2001, there had been nineteen disputes concerning alleged violations of the SPS Agreement. Of these, two had been resolved following consultations, seven had led to the establishment of panels (which in four cases led to the subsequent resolution of the dispute), and ten were still pending. OECD countries have been prominently involved in these SPS disputes. In 16 of the 19 cases, both the country raising an issue and the country concerned were OECD- 30 members. In two cases, a developing country invoked dispute settlement procedures against import practices in an OECD country, and in one case developing countries were both the complaining party and the party complained about. Some observers have noted that there seem to be a number of cases where either the substantive obligations of the SPS Agreement or bilateral exchanges in its institutional framework have contributed to regulatory reform. These policy changes might have come about anyway as a result of findings by regulatory scientists that import protocols could be designed in ways to reduce risks to acceptable levels. But the framework of SPS disciplines might have provided assurance that other countries would review their rules and procedures according to the same principles. ...|$|E

40|$|The present {{argument}} {{reflects an}} attempt to write a coherent world history of mythology along strict methodological lines of empirical <b>enquiry.</b> <b>Point</b> of departure is the Out-of-Africa hypothesis. The argument seeks to identify the mythological content, if any, of the Out-of-Africa package (140, 000 BP). For this purpose a corpus of c. 200 mythemes is constructed from sub-Saharan Africa cosmogonic myths as attested in historical times. The corpus is then subsumed under 20 Narrative Complexes, whose number is further reduced because some {{turn out to be}} implied in others. The Narrative Complexes are subjected to elaborate methodologies of absolute and relative dating, based on considerations from the fields of astronomy, genetics, archaeology, modes-of-production analysis, ethnographic distributional analysis, and hermeneutics; these are also argued to offer clues as to the location of origin of each Narrative Complex. It turns out that, as an abstract model with mainly heuristic claims, all Narrative Complexes may be situated, in space and time, along a sustained global mainstream process of mythological development. This starts out in South East Africa with a pre-Out-of-Africa package, subsequently follows the recursive path (first eastward along the Indian Ocean coast, then westward) of Anatomically Modern Humans across the Old World, finally to be fed back, secondarily, into Africa. In the process, the successive Narrative Complexes emerge, spread, and interact, i...|$|R

50|$|Frank {{was born}} at Horfield near Bristol and was educated at Marcy, near Lille in France and later King's College School. He went to study at the Royal School of Mines in London where he won the Frankland prize of the Institute of Chemistry. With a keen {{interest}} in the study of geology, he joined the British North Borneo Company as a mineral explorer and set off on his first expedition, leaving London in August 1881. He reached Labuan in October and Abai in November. He explored the Sequati and Kurina rivers before recouping at Singapore and in the summer of 1882 he visited the Labuk river followed by Kinoram district. He was killed when his gun, tangled in the forest, went off while pursuing an elephant. Frank had been extremely interested in exploration, with a knowledge of local dialects and well read on the works of earlier explorers. After his death, his body was brought by several days of canoe journey on the Kinabatangan River to Elopura.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{detailed}} study {{of several of the}} most controversial aspects of parliamentary enclosure. The extent to which some of the allegations of contemporary and modern writers can be applied to Leicestershire is examined, and the limitations of the historical sources for a statistical <b>enquiry</b> <b>pointed</b> out. This work has two principal objects. The first is to show why and how enclosures took place in this county, and to discover how far a conflict of interests between the various social classes arose. The work of the enclosure commission was of fundamental importance, and therefore the appointment and the procedure of the Leicestershire commissioners are examined in detail and their integrity assessed. The case study of the enclosure of Whitwick illustrates the nature and volume of pre-enclosure negotiations amongst the leading interests in the parish, and shows how the administrative and legal problems, which arose after the Act was passed, were overcome. A subsidiary study is made {{of the extent to which}} direct influence was exerted in the unreformed Commons over Members dealing with enclosure Bills. The second object is to analyse the principal social and economic effects of enclosure. Thus the factors bringing about changes in the distribution of landownership, notably the cost of enclosure and the commutation of tithes, are considered in detail. The land tax returns reveal that, although the large proprietors and farmers were steadily acquiring land, the effect of enclosure was not so revolutionary as is sometimes supposed. One hundred and nine parishes have been grouped according to the date of their complete enclosure, and the course of poor releif expenditure traced in each group. It is seen that, despite the large acreage converted to pasture in Leicestershire, enclosure was not one of the main causes of the great increases in the sums spent on the poor during the period under consideration. The widely differing circumstances of each parish, however, indivate the danger of broad generalisation in this field...|$|R
40|$|University-community {{engagement}} involves complex issues, entangling {{multiple and}} interacting points of view, {{all of which}} operate in a wider dynamic evolving social environment. For this reason, there is often disagreement about why engagement is necessary or desirable, and whether there is one optimal method to practice it. To address this issue, I argue that university-community engagement can be examined {{as a form of}} enquiry. In this view, engagement is viewed as a system that arises through the recognition of the dissent it embodies. As such, enquiry functions to process disagreements into diverse methods of communication. &# 13; &# 13; Most of the disagreements utilised by universities are derived from external sources, thus university-based enquiry must necessarily involve a dialogue with a broader community or environment. In this sense, university-community engagement can be viewed most generally as a method that processes disagreements into shared understandings through enquiry. &# 13; &# 13; To demonstrate how university-community engagement functions from an <b>enquiry</b> <b>point</b> of view, I use Mary Douglas’ grid-group diagramming method to develop a critical typology for classifying university-community engagement. My modified grid-group diagram provides a structured typological space within which four distinct methods of university-community engagement can be identified and discussed – both in relation to their internal communicational characteristics, and in relation to each other. &# 13; &# 13; The university-engagement grid-group diagram is constructed by locating each of Douglas’ four quadrants within Charles Peirce’s four methods of enquiry. Peirce’s work is introduced because each of his four methods of enquiry deals specifically with how disagreements are processed and resolved. When Peirce’s methods for fixing belief are located in Douglas’ grid-group diagram, they create a sense-making framework for university-community engagement. It is argued that the model offers a heuristic structure through which to view the diversity of university-community engagement and create shared understandings of the appropriateness {{of a wide range of}} possible engagement methods...|$|R

40|$|This paper critiques the {{usefulness}} of cognitive-behavioural therapy, which is often seen {{as a means of}} redressing the loss of community and friendship networks within society. Therapy in this context they runs the danger of becoming an Iatrogenesis at worst and just another `technology of mood’ at best. In this paper we develop the critiques made elsewhere and provide a more nuanced argument that considers a wider range of psychological therapies. While all psychological therapies operate at an individual level, there are wide differences in the epistemological stances taken by differing therapeutic schools. Cognitive-behavioural therapy focuses on the idea of dysfunctional thinking within the individual, psychoanalytic therapy focuses upon developmental legacies, whereas person-centred therapy focuses on currently active social influences. In this form one to one therapy can be a route to change which is compatible with our sociological critique. However, the broader criticism that psychological therapies attempt to compensate for breakdowns in friendship and social networks remains. Furthermore reviews of psychotherapeutic outcome data and qualitative <b>enquiry</b> both <b>point</b> to the experience of authentic relationship rather than psychotherapeutic technique as the major determinant of outcome. Preventing social dislocation rather than trying to repair it post hoc should be the goal.

40|$|Call centres have mushroomed {{as a new}} {{dominant}} {{paradigm for}} service delivery. This paper presents data from fieldwork into tele-nursing within the UK health service, NHS Direct, as ‘nursing down the phone’ {{can be seen as}} a new expression of this wider development. We argue that nursing as a category of work has not been transformed through the advent of telenursing, unlike the situation in commercial call centres. Rather tele-nursing has appeared and developed as one further specialism within the nursing medical repertoire. Furthermore, the organisation of NHS Direct, as a nurse-led and dominated service, may have permitted nurses to expand their knowledge and professional power. But we are not suggesting either an upskilling or knowledge worker thesis as two developments put pressure on nurse’s work. The first is the call centre pressures operating within NHS Direct, despite its’ non-commercial and information/referral character as a health advisory service and the presence of a discourse of transformation with management. The second is the operation of a Clinical Assessment System (CAS) that nurses are obliged to use when responding to caller/patient <b>enquiries.</b> Our conclusions <b>point</b> towards the interplay between occupational autonomy and organisational control within a new service that has not yet finalised its design for the job of a tele-nurse...|$|R

2500|$|The plurality's opinion {{included}} a thorough {{discussion on the}} doctrine of stare decisis (respect of precedent), and provided a clear explanation for why the doctrine had to be applied in Casey with regards to Roe. The authors of the plurality opinion emphasized that stare decisis had to apply in Casey because the Roe rule had not been proven intolerable; the rule had become subject [...] "to a kind of reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequences of overruling and add inequity {{to the cost of}} repudiation"; the law had not developed in such a way around the rule that left the rule [...] "no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine"; and the facts had not changed, nor viewed differently, to [...] "rob the old rule of significant application or justification." [...] The plurality acknowledged that it was important for the Court to stand by prior decisions, even those decisions some found unpopular, unless there was a change in the fundamental reasoning underpinning the previous decision. The authors of the plurality opinion, making a special note of the precedential value of Roe v. Wade, and specifically how women's lives were changed by that decision, stated, [...] "The sum of the precedential <b>enquiry</b> to this <b>point</b> shows Roe's underpinnings unweakened in any way affecting its central holding. While it has engendered disapproval, it has not been unworkable. An entire generation has come of age free to assume Roe's concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions; no erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left Roe's central holding a doctrinal remnant."The authors of the plurality opinion also acknowledged the need for predictability and consistency in judicial decision making. For example,"Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case {{in such a way as}} to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe and those rare, comparable cases, its decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It is the dimension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution."The plurality went on to analyze past judgments refusing to apply the doctrine of stare decisis, such as Brown v. Board of Education. There, the authors of the plurality opinion explained, society's rejection of the [...] "Separate but Equal" [...] concept was a legitimate reason for the Brown v. Board of Education court’s rejection of the Plessy v. Ferguson doctrine. Emphasizing the lack of need to overrule the essential holding of Roe, and the Court's need to not be seen as overruling a prior decision merely because the individual members of the Court had changed, the authors of the plurality opinion stated,"Because neither the factual underpinnings of Roe's central holding nor our understanding of it has changed (and because no other indication of weakened precedent has been shown), the Court could not pretend to be reexamining the prior law with any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the Court of 1973.”The plurality further emphasized that the Court would lack legitimacy if it frequently changed its Constitutional decisions, stating, [...] "The Court must take care to speak and act in ways that allow people to accept its decisions on the terms the Court claims for them, as grounded truly in principle, not as compromises with social and political pressures having, as such, no bearing on the principled choices that the Court is obliged to make."Since the O'Connor-Kennedy-Souter plurality overruled some portions of Roe v. Wade despite its emphasis on stare decisis, Chief Justice Rehnquist in dissent argued that this section was entirely obiter dicta. All these opening sections were joined by Justices Blackmun and Stevens for the majority. The remainder of the decision did not command a majority, but at least two other Justices concurred in judgment on each of the remaining points.|$|R
