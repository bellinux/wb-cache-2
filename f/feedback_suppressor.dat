50|$|The {{sound system}} {{operator}} can use equalization {{to change the}} frequency response of a microphone or loudspeakers system to increase GBF. The frequency which first begins ringing or feeding back is identified by the operator, and a notch filter or parametric filter is engaged to reduce the overall level of that frequency. This process is repeated several times to identify and reduce the level of further feedback frequencies. A graphic equalizer {{can be used for}} the same purpose but with somewhat less precision. Automatic <b>feedback</b> <b>suppressors</b> automate and speed the process of identifying and reducing feedback frequencies. A small amount of pitch shift applied to the signal can increase GBF, as can the addition of a few milliseconds of straight delay. The latter will increase the number of feedback frequencies while reducing the frequency range within which they occur, but it will slow the rate at which feedback grows. In practice, adding straight delay to a signal improves GBF.|$|R

Recently, inducible <b>feedback</b> <b>suppressors</b> of cytokine signalling (SOCS/JAB/SSI) have been identified, which decrease cell sensitivity to cytokines. We examined the expression of SOCS genes in 17 breast carcinomas and 10 breast cancer lines, in comparison with normal tissue and breast lines. We report elevated expression of SOCS- 1 - 3 and CIS immunoreactive proteins within in situ ductal carcinomas and infiltrating ductal carcinomas relative to normal breast tissue. Significantly increased expression of SOCS- 1 - 3 and CIS transcripts was also shown by quantitative in situ hybridisation within both tumour tissue and reactive stroma. CIS transcript expression was elevated in all 10 cancer lines, but not in control lines. However, there was no consistent elevation of other SOCS transcripts. CIS protein was shown by immunoblot {{to be present in}} all cancer lines at increased levels, mainly as the 47 kDa ubiquitinylated form. A potential proliferative role for CIS overexpression is supported by reports that CIS activates ERK kinases, and by strong induction in transient reporter assays with an ERK-responsive promoter. The in vivo elevation of SOCS gene expression may be part of the host/tumour response or a response to autocrine/paracrine GH and prolactin. However, increased CIS expression in breast cancer lines appears to be a specific lesion, and could simultaneously shut down STAT 5 signalling by trophic hormones, confer resistance to host cytokines and increase proliferation through ERK kinases...|$|R

To analyze persistent STAT 3 activation we coexpressed STAT 3 with v-Src. We found that tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 3 by v-Src is independent of Janus kinases (Jaks), the canonical activators of STATs. The STAT 3 -induced <b>feedback</b> inhibitor, <b>suppressor</b> of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS 3), did not interfere with STAT 3 activation by v-Src. However, the protein inhibitor of activated STAT 3 (PIAS 3) suppressed gene induction by persistently activated STAT 3. We measured nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of STAT 3 in single cells by bleaching the YFP moiety of double-labelled STAT 3 -CFP-YFP in the cytoplasm. Analysis of the subcellular distribution of CFP and YFP fluorescence over time by mathematical modeling and computational parameter estimation revealed that activated STAT 3 shuttles more rapidly than non-activated STAT 3. Inhibition of exportin- 1 -mediated nuclear export slowed down nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of v-Src-activated STAT 3 resulting in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation, decreased induction of STAT 3 target genes and increased apoptosis.

40|$|While {{the hormone}} leptin and its {{receptor}} were discovered relatively recently, {{a great deal}} is already known about the molecular details of leptin receptor (LR) signaling and physiologic regulation. While multiple alternatively spliced LR isoforms exist, only the long (LRb) form associates with the Janus kinase 2 (Jak 2) tyrosine kinase to mediate intracellular signaling. LRb initiates signaling via three major mechanisms: 1) Tyr 985 of LRb recruits SH 2 -containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP- 2); 2) Tyr 1138 of LRb recruits signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3); and 3) tyrosine phosphorylation sites on the receptor-associated Jak 2 likely recruit numerous undefined signaling proteins.

We examined the liver protective mechanism and correlated signalling pathway of LPS preconditioning in mice. MethodsBALB/c and TLR 4 mutant mice underwent 90 min of 70 % hepatic ischaemia. Lipopolysaccharide (100 µg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 20 h or 30 min before ischaemia. Liver damage after reperfusion was examined using serum samples and liver specimens. To analyse the mechanism of preconditioning in detail, phosphorylation of representative signalling mediators to nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation, Akt and interleukin- 1 receptor-associated kinase- 1 (IRAK- 1), and expression of a negative <b>feedback</b> inhibitor, <b>suppressor</b> of cytokine signalling- 1 (SOCS- 1), were evaluated by Western blotting. ResultsPretreatment with LPS only 20 h before ischaemia elicited a preconditioning effect; however, preconditioning was absent in TLR 4 mutant mice. Lipopolysaccharide significantly decreased serum alanine aminotransferase, tumour necrosis factor-α, hepatocyte necrosis and NF-κB activity after reperfusion. Phosphorylated IRAK- 1 was suppressed by LPS, whereas no difference was observed in phosphorylated Akt. Pre-ischaemic LPS provided early induction of SOCS- 1.

40|$|Self-renewal and the {{maintenance}} of pluripotency of mouse embryonal stem (ES) cells in vitro requires exogenous leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Mouse ES cells can be cultured and kept undifferentiated in the absence of embryonal feeder-cell layers when exogenous LIF concentrations are maintained above a threshold concentration. An important downstream target of LIF signal transduction in mouse ES cells is the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3). In contrast to mouse ES cells, human ES cells are unresponsive to LIF and depend on feeder cells for undifferentiated growth. Here, we investigated the activation patterns of LIF-downstream effectors in mouse and human embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. We report that LIF induces both ERK- 1 as well as STAT 3 activation in mouse P 19 EC cells. LIF enhances the proliferation rate of P 19 EC cells, which depends on ERK activity but does not require activation of STAT 3. In contrast, LIF does not activate STAT 3, ERK, or the gp 130 receptor in human N tera- 2 /D 1 EC cells, although all receptor components are expressed. The negative <b>feedback</b> protein <b>suppressor</b> of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS- 1) is constitutively expressed in N tera- 2 /D 1 EC cells, suggesting that LIF signal transduction is inhibited by elevated levels of SOCS- 1 expression.

40|$|T {{cells from}} antigen-primed mice have a diminished {{capacity}} to mediate feedback suppression {{when compared to}} T cells from unprimed mice. This was demonstrated using an in vitro model of B-cell induced feedback suppression in which spleen cells from mice primed with sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) activate <b>feedback</b> <b>suppressor</b> T-cell precursors to mediate suppression of the primed spleen cell response. The addition of splenic T cells from unprimed mice to cultures of spleen cells from SRBC-primed mice resulted in suppression of the secondary IgM and IgG anti-SRBC response.

The loss of suppression by T cells from primed mice was antigen-specific and was detectable by 24 hr after priming, coinciding with the appearance after priming of T-cell enhancing activity. The reduced suppressive activity could be due to changes in the active T-cell subset itself or to the appearance of cells or factors within the T-cell population that block or mask detection of feedback suppression. In either case, the present finding suggests that priming of a host not only activates feedback suppression induction mechanisms, but also rapidly affects the ability of the T-cell population to develop effective feedback suppression...|$|E

We examined the role of A-to-I RNA editing by two ADARs, ADAR 1 and ADAR 2, in the sensing of self-RNA in the absence of pathogen infection, leading to activation of IFN-induced, RNA-mediated responses in mouse embryo fibroblasts. IFN treatment of Adar 1 (-/-) cells lacking both the p 110 constitutive and p 150 IFN-inducible ADAR 1 proteins induced formation of stress granules, whereas neither wild-type (WT) nor Adar 2 (-/-) cells displayed a comparable stress granule response following IFN treatment. Phosphorylation of protein synthesis initiation factor eIF 2 α at serine 51 was increased in IFN-treated Adar 1 (-/-) cells but not in either WT or Adar 2 (-/-) cells following IFN treatment. Analysis by deep sequencing of mouse exonic loci containing A-to-I-editing sites revealed that the majority of editing in mouse embryo fibroblasts was carried out by ADAR 1. IFN treatment increased editing in both WT and Adar 2 (-/-) cells but not in either Adar 1 (-/-) or Adar 1 (-/-) (p 150) cells or Stat 1 (-/-) or Stat 2 (-/-) cells.

The paradox that superantigens cause activation and inactivation/anergy of T-cells was soon recognized. The structural and molecular events following superantigen binding to antigen presenting cells (APCs) followed by crosslinking of T-cell receptors were characterized in detail. Activation, cytokine burst and T-cell anergy {{have been described}} in vitro and in vivo. Later {{it became clear that}} superantigen-induced T-cell anergy is in part caused by superantigen-dependent activation of T-regulatory cells (Tregs). Although the main focus of analyses was laid on T-cells, it was also shown that superantigen binding to MHC class II molecules on APCs induces a signal, which leads to activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly APCs are mandatory for T-cell activation. So far it is not known, whether antigen presenting cells play a role during superantigen-triggered activation of Tregs. We therefore tested whether in superantigen (Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A) -treated APCs an-anti-inflammatory program is triggered in addition. We show here that not only the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 and the co-inhibitory surface molecule PD-L 1 (CD 274) but also inhibitory effector systems like indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) or intracellular negative <b>feedback</b> loops (<b>suppressor</b> of cytokine signaling molecules, SOCS) are induced by superantigens. Moreover, cyclosporine A completely prevented induction of this program.

Mice expressing G-CSF-R truncation mutants (gcsfr-d 715) show defective receptor internalization, an increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT 5) /STAT 3 activation ratio, and hyperproliferative responses to G-CSF treatment. We determined whether a lack of negative <b>feedback</b> by <b>suppressor</b> of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins contributes to the signaling abnormalities of G-CSF-R-d 715. Expression of SOCS 3 transcripts in bone marrow cells from G-CSF-treated gcsfr-d 715 mice was approximately 60 % lower than in wild-type (WT) littermates. SOCS 3 efficiently suppressed STAT 3 and STAT 5 activation by WT G-CSF-R in luciferase reporter assays. In contrast, while SOCS 3 still inhibited STAT 3 activation by G-CSF-R-d 715, STAT 5 activation was no longer affected. This was due mainly to loss of the SOCS 3 recruitment site Tyr 729, with an additional contribution of the internalization defects of G-CSF-R-d 715. Because Tyr 729 is also a docking site for the Src homology 2 -containing protein tyrosine phosphatase- 2 (SHP- 2), which binds to and inactivates STAT 5, we suggest a model in which reduced SOCS 3 expression, combined {{with the loss of}} recruitment of both SOCS 3 and SHP- 2 to the activated receptor complex, determine the increased STAT 5 /STAT 3 activation ratio and the resulting signaling abnormalities projected by truncated G-CSF-R mutants...|$|R
40|$|On human macrophages IL- 10 {{acts as a}} {{more potent}} {{anti-inflammatory}} cytokine than IL- 6, although both cytokines signal mainly via activation of the transcription factor STAT 3. In this study we compare IL- 10 and IL- 6 signaling in primary human macrophages derived from blood monocytes. Pretreatment of macrophages with PMA or the proinflammatory mediators LPS and TNF-alpha blocks IL- 6 -induced STAT 3 activation, whereas IL- 10 -induced activation of STAT 3 remains largely unaffected. Although LPS induces the <b>feedback</b> inhibitor <b>suppressor</b> of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS 3) in macrophages, inhibition of IL- 6 signal transduction by LPS occurs rapidly and {{does not depend on}} gene transcription. We also found that pretreatment of macrophages with IL- 10 inhibits subsequent STAT 3 activation by IL- 6, whereas IL- 10 -induced STAT 3 activation is not affected by preincubation with IL- 6. This cross-inhibition is dependent on active transcription and might therefore be explained by different sensitivities of IL- 10 and IL- 6 signaling toward the feedback inhibitor SOCS 3, which is induced by both cytokines. In contrast to the IL- 6 signal transducer gp 130, which has been previously shown to recruit SOCS 3 to one of its phosphotyrosine residues (Y 759), peptide precipitation experiments suggest that SOCS 3 does not interact with phosphorylated tyrosine motifs of the IL- 10 R. Taken together, different sensitivities of IL- 10 and IL- 6 signaling toward mechanisms that inhibit the Janus kinase/STAT pathway define an important mechanism that contributes to the different anti-inflammatory potencies of these two cytokines...|$|R

Recently, the <b>feedback</b> inhibitor <b>suppressor</b> of cytokine signaling- 3 (SOCS- 3), also referred to as cytokine-inducible SH 2 -containing protein 3 (CIS- 3), has been shown to act on Epo signaling by both binding to the EpoR and the EpoR-associated Janus kinase 2 (Jak 2) [Sasaki, A., Yasukawa, H., Shouda, T., Kitamura, T., Dikic, I. & Yoshimura, A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem 275, 29338 - 29347]. In this study tyrosine 401 was identified as a binding site for SOCS- 3 on the EpoR. Here we show that human SOCS- 3 binds to pY 401 with a Kd of 9. 5 microm while another EpoR tyrosine motif, pY 429 pY 431, can also interact with SOCS- 3 but with a ninefold higher affinity than we found for the previously reported motif pY 401. In addition, SOCS- 3 binds the double phosphorylated motif pY 429 pY 431 more potently than the respective singly phosphorylated tyrosines indicating a synergistic effect of these two tyrosine residues with respect to SOCS- 3 binding.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: STAT {{proteins}} play {{an important}} role in cytokine signaling. Some investigators have reported preferential activation of STAT- 1, and others have reported preferential activation of STAT- 3, in response to endogenous interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The present study was undertaken to investigate synovial STAT- 1 and STAT- 3 activation in an experimental animal model of arthritis. METHODS: Zymosan was injected intraarticularly into naive wild-type (WT), IL- 6 (-/-), and STAT- 1 (-/-) mice to induce arthritis. Western blots of synovial lysates were probed with phosphospecific antibodies to detect STAT- 1 /STAT- 3 activation. Inflammation was assessed histologically. Synovial gene expression of the STAT-induced <b>feedback</b> inhibitors <b>suppressor</b> of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS- 1) and SOCS- 3 in WT and STAT- 1 (-/-) mice was investigated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: STAT- 3 was activated in inflamed synovium of WT mice throughout the course of disease, whereas activated STAT- 1 was observed only during the chronic phase. In IL- 6 (-/-) mice, STAT activation was limited to STAT- 3 on day 1. Although macrophage influx was not inhibited, disease went into remission after day 7 in IL- 6 (-/-) mice. STAT- 1 deficiency resulted in exacerbation of chronic joint inflammation and granuloma formation. In STAT- 1 (-/-) mice, STAT- 3 activation in the inflamed joints was unaltered as compared with WT mice. However, synovial SOCS- 1, but not SOCS- 3, gene expression was markedly reduced in STAT- 1 (-/-) mice. CONCLUSION: The results in the IL- 6 (-/-) mice suggest that STAT- 3 is involved in the chronicity of ZIA. Exacerbation of arthritis in STAT- 1 (-/-) mice suggests an opposing effect of STAT- 1, i. e., suppression of joint inflammation. The expression of SOCS- 1 could be the underlying mechanism by which STAT- 1 controls joint inflammation...|$|R
40|$|To avoid {{overshooting}} cytokine signalling {{with possible}} pathological consequences, the duration {{as well as}} the intensity of the activated signal transduction pathways are tightly regulated. The importance of the <b>feedback</b> inhibitor <b>suppressor</b> of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS 3) in inhibition of the interleukin (IL) - 6 type cytokine signal transduction is well documented. Expression of SOCS 3 is induced via the STAT transcription factors, and it exerts its inhibitory effect via interaction with the phosphorylated Y 759 motif within the cytoplasmic region of the common receptor chain of all IL- 6 type cytokines, gp 130. Thereby SOCS 3 colocalizes with the receptor associated Janus kinases, which is a prerequisite for the inhibition of the kinase activity. In this study, the role of the specific Oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) in the SOCS 3 mediated inhibition of the OSM pathway is analyzed. The obtained results point to a new mechanism of the inhibitory action of SOCS 3. We could show that OSM induces the expression of SOCS 3 much more efficiently than IL- 6 due to a strong activation of the mitogen activated protein kinases ERK 1 and 2 which act together with the STAT factors to induce the feedback inhibitor. The negative regulatory role on OSM mediated signal transduction is independent of the gp 130 Y 759 motif. However, a direct interaction of SOCS 3 with the OSMR – analogous to gp 130 and all receptors so far described to be SOCS 3 sensitive – could be excluded. Rather, the inhibitory function of SOCS 3 depends on a direct interaction with JAK 1. So far such a direct interaction has only been shown with overexpressed proteins and thought to be physiologically irrelevant due to the weak affinity of SOCS 3 to the phosphorylated kinase activation loop. The second part of this study deals with the inhibitory effect of the arsenic compound phenylarsine oxide (PAO) on the signal transduction of IL- 6 type cytokines. It is shown, that PAO influences this pathway in two ways. On the one hand, it induces the endocytosis of gp 130 via activation of p 38 and phosphorylation of serine 782 within the receptor internalization motif. This contradicts its postulated function as internalization inhibitor. Second, PAO inhibits the activation of JAK 1 and TYK 2, probably due to the oxidation of vicinal thiol groups. Thereby, the activation of the STATs is inhibited. Although in many studies PAO is used as a phosphatase inhibitor, comparative studies with pervanadate do not support this function in our experimental system. Interestingly, a selective influence of PAO on STAT activation via the IL- 6 type cytokines was found. While the IFN-gamma mediated JAK 1 and JAK 2 phosphorylation are inhibited by preincubation with PAO, nearly no effect is seen on the resulting STAT 1 activation. This points to a different regulation of the IL- 6, LIF and OSM induced STAT activation compared to the one by IFN-gamma. Besides, PAO was used in studies with parental and JAK 1 deficient fibrosarcoma cells additionally to other JAK inhibitors to get further insights into the relative importance of the different kinases JAK 1, JAK 2 and TYK 2 in IL- 6 and OSM mediated signalling pathways. Thereby, an important role of JAK 1 in the IL- 6 dependent STAT 3 phosphorylation could be confirmed. Additionally, it was shown that the presence of JAK 1 is necessary for the OSM induced JAK 2 but not TYK 2 phosphorylation and that TYK 2 is sufficient for a normal STAT 3 phosphorylation {{even in the absence of}} JAK 1 and JAK 2 activation...|$|R
