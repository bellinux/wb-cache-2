After sonication at room temperature, the solution was filtered using 200 -nm porous filter and obtained the pre-oxidized graphite powder. To exfoliate the pre-oxidized graphite powder into monolayer graphene sheets, 2 g powder and 15 g KMnO 4 were added into 120 ml H 2 SO 4 with stirring and an <b>ice-water</b> <b>bath</b> was adopted to ensure the temperature remain below 10 °C. The mixture was stirred for 2 h under <b>ice-water</b> <b>bath.</b> About 250 ml distilled water and 20 ml H 2 O 2 (30 %) were added to dilute the solution at room temperature.

40|$|Stationary-phase {{cultures}} of different hyperthermophilic {{species of the}} archaeal genus Sulfolobus were diluted into fresh growth medium and analyzed by flow cytometry and phase-fluorescence microscopy. After dilution, cellular growth started rapidly but no nucleoid partition, cell division, or chromosome replication took place until the cells had been increasing in size for several hours. Initiation of chromosome replication required that the cells first go through partition and cell division, revealing a strong interdependence between these key cell cycle events. The time points at which nucleoid partition, division, and replication occurred after the dilution were used to estimate the relative lengths of the cell cycle periods. When exponentially growing cultures were diluted into fresh growth medium, there was an unexpected transient inhibition of growth and cell division, showing that the cultures did not maintain balanced growth. Furthermore, when cultures growing at 79 °C were shifted to room temperature or to <b>ice-water</b> <b>baths,</b> the cells were found to “freeze” in mid-growth. After a shift back to 79 °C, growth, replication, and division rapidly resumed and the mode and kinetics of the resumption differed depending upon the nature and length of the shifts. Dilution of stationary-phase cultures provides a simple protocol for the generation of partially synchronized populations {{that may be used}} to study cell cycle-specific events...|$|R
40|$|An {{automatic}} system, {{based on}} the on-line coupling of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation, post column microwave digestion, and cold-vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS) detection, was proposed for the speciation analysis of four mercury compounds. Post column microwave digestion, {{in the presence of}} potassium persulfate (in HCl), was applied in the system to improve the conversion efficiency of three organic mercury compounds into inorganic mercury. Parameters influencing the on-line digestion efficiency and the separation effect were optimized. To avoid water vapor and methanol entering into the atomic fluorescence detector, <b>ice-water</b> mixture <b>bath</b> was used to cool the rnicrowave-digested sample solution. Four mercury species including inorganic mercury chloride (MC), methylmercury chloride (MMC), ethylmercury chloride (EMC) and phenylmercury chloride (PMC) were baseline separated within 13 min by using RP C 18 column with a mobile phase of 50 % (v/v) methanol containing 10 mmol 1 (- 1) tetrabutyl ammonium bromide and 0. 1 mol 1 (- 1) sodium chloride pumped at 1. 2 ml min(- 1). Seafood samples, composed of three gastropod species and two bivalve species from Yantai port, China, have been analyzed by the proposed method.

Nelson (TFE) against vascular endothelial injury in blood stasis model rats and explore the potential mechanisms preliminarily. The model of blood stasis rat model with vascular endothelial injury was induced by subcutaneous injection of adrenaline combined with <b>ice-water</b> <b>bath.</b> Whole blood viscosity (WBV), histological examination, and prothrombin time (PT), {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT), and fibrinogen (FIB) were measured. Meanwhile, the levels of Thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2), 6 -keto-PGF 1 α, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and thrombomodulin (TM) were detected. In addition, Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR) was performed to identify PI 3 K, Erk 2, Bcl- 2, and caspase- 3 gene expression. The results showed that TFE can relieve WBV, increase PT and APTT, and decrease FIB content obviously. Moreover, TFE might significantly downregulate the levels of TXB 2, vWF, and TM in plasma and upregulate the level of 6 -keto-PGF 1 α in plasma. Expressions of PI 3 K and Bcl- 2 were increased and the expression of caspase- 3 was decreased by TFE pretreatment in the rat model.

Rows of fins composed of high conductivity silicon are bonded onto a 100 µm thick base plate composed of low conductivity Pyrex glass. The heat exchanger has a footprint of 61. 5 cm 2 and 2. 5 mm thickness, and is fabricated using a 5 -mask process. The fabrication process involves anodic bonding, deep reactive ion dry etching, glass frit bonding, electrochemical discharge drilling and several other steps, along with special features that compensate for manufacturing tolerances. Preliminary experiments include measurement of the thermal effectiveness in an <b>ice-water</b> <b>bath,</b> as well as evaluation of self-cooling with butane. The data suggest an optimal area of 0. 2 mm 2 for the expansion orifice. The primary performance constraint is imposed by the compromise between mechanical robustness and transverse conductance of the thin glass plate that separate the high pressure and low pressure sides.

30|$|A T. discophora {{culture was}} {{filtered}} with filter aids, Radiolite # 2000 (Showa Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) then stored at 4  °C until use. Metabolites were extracted by heat treatment as follows. The cooled broth (100  g) {{was added to}} 400  mL of tap water previously maintained at 61  °C in an egg-plant shaped flask, and incubated at 51 – 54  °C for 70  min. Then, it was cooled immediately in an <b>ice-water</b> <b>bath</b> and filtered. The filtrate was stirred at 4  °C to convert 4 -amino- 4 -deoxyarabinitol to nectrisine. To detect nectrisine and 4 -amino- 4 -deoxyarabinitol directly, HPLC with evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) was performed using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with an evaporative light scattering detector Model 300 S (SofTA, Westminster, CO) and an Xbridge BEH HILIC column, 4.6  ×  75  mm, 2.5  μm (Waters) (Kimura et al. 2004) under the following conditions: mobile phase, 90  % CH 3 CN/ 10  % H 2 O/ 20  mM CH 3 CO 2 NH 4; flow rate, 1  mL/min; column oven temperature, 40  °C; spray chamber, 40  °C; and drift tube, optical cell, and exhaust tube, 60  °C.|$|E
40|$|High {{hydrostatic}} pressure {{has been used}} to inactivate pathogens in foods for decades. There is a great potential to adapt this technology to inactivate pathogens in plasma and derivatives. To better evaluate the potential of this method, pathogen inoculated plasma samples were pressurized under different pressure application modes and temperatures. The inactivation efficacy of pathogens and activities of plasma proteins were monitored after treatment. The CFUs of E. coli was examined as the indicator of the inactivation efficiency. The factor V and VIII were chosen as the indicator of the plasma function. Preliminary experiments identified optimized treatment conditions: 200 - 250 MPa, with 5 × 1 minute multi-pulsed high pressure at near 0 °C (<b>ice-water</b> <b>bath).</b> Under this conditions, the inactivation efficacy of EMCV was > 8. 5 log. The CFUs of E. coli were reduced by 7. 5 log, B. cereus were 8 log. However, PPV and S. aureus cannot be inactivated efficiently. The activities of factor II, VII, IX, X, XI, XII, fibrinogen, IgG, IgM stayed over 95 % compared to untreated. Factor V and VIII activity was maintained at 46 - 63 % and 77 - 82 %, respectively...|$|E

Xueshuan Xinmaining Tablet (XXT), the Chinese formula, has long been administered in clinical practice {{for the treatment of}} cerebral thrombosis and coronary heart disease. In this study, we aimed to study the effect and the molecular mechanism of activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis. Rat models of cold coagulation blood stasis were induced with <b>ice-water</b> <b>bath</b> and epinephrine to assess the amelioration of blood stasis by XXT. Microarray technique was used to identify gene expression from the model and XXT-treated rats. In addition, Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR) was performed to verify the microarray results. The results showed that XXT had a good therapeutic effect on blood stasis by reducing the whole blood viscosity (WBV), plasma viscosity (PV), increasing PT, APTT and TT, and by inhibiting platelet aggregation. Genes were differentially expressed in rats among the model group and the XXT-pretreated groups. XXT ameliorated blood stasis by regulating the expressions of F 13 a 1, Car 1, and Tbxa 2 r. 1...|$|E
