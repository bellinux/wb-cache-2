60|$|Slavery, {{continued}} Mr. Lincoln, is not {{a matter}} of little importance, it overshadows every other question in which we are interested. It has divided the Methodist and Presbyterian churches, and has sown discord in the American Tract Society. The churches have split and the society will follow their example before long. So it will be seen that slavery is agitated in the religious as well as in the political world. Judge Douglas is very much afraid in the triumph that the Republican party will lead to a general mixture of the white and black races. Perhaps I am wrong in saying that he is afraid, so I will correct myself by saying that he pretends to fear that the success of our party will result in the amalgamation of the blacks and whites. I think I can show plainly, from documents now before me, that Judge Douglas's fears are groundless. The census of 1800 tells us that in that year there were over four hundred thousand mulattoes in the United States. Now let us take what is called an Abolition State--the Republican, slavery-hating State of New Hampshire--and see how many mulattoes we can find within her borders. The number amounts to just one hundred and eighty-four. In the Old Dominion--in the Democratic and aristocratic State of Virginia--there were a few more mulattoes than the Census-takers found in New Hampshire. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> suppose there were? Seventy-nine thousand, seven hundred and seventy-five--twenty-three thousand more than there were in all the free States! In the slave States there were in 1800, three hundred and forty-eight thousand mulattoes all of home production; and in the free States there were less than sixty thousand mulattoes--and a large number of them were imported from the South.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{studies show}} that {{perceived}} smoking prevalence is {{a significant predictor of}} smoking initiation. In this study, we examine racial/ethnic differences in perceived smoking prevalence and racial/ethnic differences in exposure to contextual factors associated with perceived smoking prevalence. We used cross-sectional time series data from the Legacy Media Tracking Surveys (LMTS), a national sample of 35, 000 12 - to 17 -year-olds in the United States. Perceived smoking prevalence was the primary outcome variable, measured using an LMTS question: “Out of every 10 people your age, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think smoke?” Multivariable models were estimated to assess the association between perceived smoking prevalence; race/ethnicity; and exposure to social contextual factors. Findings indicate that African American, Hispanic, and American Indian youth exhibit the highest rates of perceived smoking prevalence, while white and Asian youth exhibit the lowest. Minority youth are also disproportionately exposed to social contextual factors that are correlated with high perceived smoking prevalence. These findings suggest that disproportionate exposure to social contextual factors may partially explain why minority youth exhibit such high levels of perceived smoking prevalence...|$|E

40|$|This report consolidates the {{feedback}} {{from each of}} the workshops following BeLonG To’s presentation on LGBT young people and the Gay Pavee Forum. Future actions to be considered by the Traveller Drug Network to progress the issues raised will also be put forward. Seven questions were asked of each group with key points from the discussions being recorded. For brevity reasons, the responses have been themed in order of frequency 2. The seven questions examined were: 1. 1 - Do you feel LGBT Travellers are supported enough by services and the Traveller community? How? 1. 2 – What challenges do LGBT Travellers face when coming out? 1. 3 – What positive changes {{would you like to see}} happen so that LGBT Travellers feel supported? 1. 4 - Do you know any LGBT Travellers? How many? <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think there are? 1. 5 - Why do you think being gay is different for Travellers compared with settled people? 1. 6 – How can LGBT Pavees Forum support Travellers who are gay? 1. 7 – What could make it easier for LGBT Travellers to disclose their sexuality to your service...|$|E
