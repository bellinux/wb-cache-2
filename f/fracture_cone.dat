5000|$|Evidence of pre-Clovis {{activity}} {{was found at}} the SV-2 site. There are three archaeological horizons evident of human occupation located within a one-meter thick alluvial, colluvial, and lacustrine sediments overlying a pedestal of bedrock. These are dated within 14,510, and 13,500-13,000 RCYBP. The oldest horizon is dated to 14,510 + 80 RCYBP (Beta-117541) {{by the presence of}} a tibia bone tool from a musk ox that was AMS radiocarbon dated. [...] Evidence for the butchering/cooking of a mastodon was found in this level. It is believed that one individual was represented. Seven complete or partial ribs, two fragments of limb bones, one tooth, and nine pieces of tusk, all of these display alike surface characteristics lacking signs of fluvial abrasion or extensive subaerial weathering. Evidence that this mastodon was processed and cooked includes the presence of two sandstone knives with worked edges that were used to cut meat and/ or remove hide. A concretion representing a congealed mass of viscous fluid replaced by minerals, may represent fat drippings produced by cooking with fire. Fire cracked rocks and a burned mastodon tooth were also found. Also associated were a triangular stone used as a hand held ax or wedge, a piece of exotic chert used as wedge chert flake, and two pieces of bone modified by human agency. The first of these is an incised basicranial complex of a midsized herbivore, and possible tibia bone tool AMS dated back to 14, 510 RCYBP which suggests a Pre Clovis occupation. It was from the shaft of a right tibia of what was assumed to be a midsized adult musk-ox since it was too gracile to belong to a bison with identification also based on surface details, absolute size, elongative nature, and the presence of other musk-oxen bone and teeth. It measured 195.2 mm in length, 48.9mm in maximum width across the proximal end of the medial surface, 36 mm in peak width in transverse (medial-lateral) section. The tibia bone exhibits three pairs of parallel fractures, two percussion <b>fracture</b> <b>cone</b> in the medullary cavity, and extensive non-random patterned wear. The fractures could have either occurred with one or numerous blow with the goal of obtaining marrow. The wear pattern indicates that the bone tool was used as a scraper or flesher, and might have been used as meat or hide splitter.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{microstructural}} {{scale on}} deformation-micro-fracture damage induced by contact with spheres is investi-gated in monophase alumina ceramics over a range 3 - 48 pm in grain size. Measurement {{of a universal}} indentation stress-strain curve indicates a critical contact pressure- 5 GPa, above which irreversible deformation occurs in alu-mina. A novel sectioning technique identifies the deforma-tion elements as intragrain shear faults, predominantly crystallographic twins, within a confining subsurface zone of intense compression-shear stress. The twins concentrate the shear stresses at the grain boundaries and, above a threshold grain size, initiate tensile intergranular micro-cracks. Below this threshold size, classical Hertzian <b>cone</b> <b>fractures</b> initiate outside the contact circle. Above the threshold, the density and scale of subsurface-zone micro-cracks increase dramatically with increasing grain size, ulti-mately dominating the <b>cone</b> <b>fractures.</b> The damage process is stochastic, highlighting the microstructural discreteness of the initial deformation field; those grains which lie in the upper tail of the grain-size distribution and which have favorable crystallographic orientation relative to local shear stresses in the contact field are preferentially acti-vated. Initial flaw state is not an important factor, because the contact process creates its own flaw population. These and other generic features of the damage process will be dis-cussed in relation to microstructural design of polycrystal-line ceramics. I...|$|R

25|$|In prehistoric times, chert {{was often}} used as a raw {{material}} {{for the construction of}} stone tools. Like obsidian, as well as some rhyolites, felsites, quartzites, and other tool stones used in lithic reduction, chert fractures in a Hertzian cone when struck with sufficient force. This results in conchoidal fractures, a characteristic of all minerals with no cleavage planes. In this kind of <b>fracture,</b> a <b>cone</b> of force propagates through the material from the point of impact, eventually removing a full or partial cone; this result is familiar to anyone who has seen what happens to a plate-glass window when struck by a small object, such as an air gun projectile.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect on}} diagnostic yield in the detection of experimentally induced vertical root <b>fractures</b> on <b>cone</b> beam CT images using four dental software program. Methods: 190 single-rooted extracted human teeth were divided into three groups according to the pulp canal status: unrestored (UR), filled with gutta-percha (GP) and restored with a metallic custom post (Post). One-half of the sample of each group was artificially fractured and the segments repositioned. All teeth were scanned on a cone beam CT device at 0. 2 mm nominal voxel resolution (i-CAT Platinum; Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, PA). The data were exported as digital imaging and communications in medicine files and imported into Dolphin Imaging & Management Solutions, v. 11. 5 (Patterson Dental Supply Inc., St Paul, MN), InVivoDental, v. 5. 0 (Anatomage Inc., San Jose, CA) and Kodak Dental Imaging Software 3 D module, v. 2. 1. 11 (Carestream Health Inc., Rochester, NY) software.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the finite element (FE) failure predictions and analyses {{of a typical}} wire for civil engineering applications with various crack-like lamination types (Single and double), geometries (straight-end and inclined-end) and orientations (longitudinal, lateral and transverse). FE prediction {{and analysis of the}} failure of notched pre-cracked wires with a surface across-the-thickness crack-like lamination validated with experimental results are also presented. The FE predicted fracture shape for the notched pre-cracked wires that consists of a cup and <b>cone</b> <b>fracture</b> shape below the bottom tip of the surface across-the-thickness crack-like lamination agrees with the experimental fracture shape. Wires with the double straight-end and double inclined-end crack-like/line-type laminations exhibit a “slant-middle W” and a “zigzag” fractures respectively. Above and below the lateral mid-width across-the-thickness lamination, the wires with the lateral mid-width across-the-thickness lamination exhibit a combination of a transverse mid-thickness flat fracture that is perpendicular to the lateral mid-width across-the-thickness lamination and negatively inclined slant fractures {{on each side of the}} mid-thickness flat fracture at the remaining outer edges of the wire's thickness. On both the front and back sides of the transverse mid-thickness across-the-width lamination, the wires with the transverse mid-thickness across-the-width lamination exhibit a combination of transverse flat fractures parallel to the transverse mid-thickness across-the-width lamination and positively inclined slant fractures at the outer edges of the wire's thickness. FE failure analysis reveals that fracture initiations do not always begin at the termini of every longitudinal crack-like/line-type lamination as reported in a published fractographic failure analysis report of wires with longitudinal crack-like laminations. Fracture initiation only begins at the termini/tip of longitudinal inclined-end crack-like laminations and at the termini/tip of transverse and lateral laminations. FE failure analysis also reveals that wires with single straight-end, double straight-end and double inclined-end longitudinal crack-like/line-type laminations do not exhibit cup and <b>cone</b> <b>fractures</b> as reported. This work further demonstrates the need to employ FE failure analysis as a complimentary or alternative failure analysis approach where the destruction/alteration of the fracture markings by corrosion could affect the accuracy of fractographic failure analysis.

40|$|Mount Murphy {{is a large}} Miocene {{shield volcano}} flanked by several small basaltic {{satellite}} centres that were erupted beneath a thick (> 200 m) ice sheet. Three empirical models illustrating the hydraulic evolution of glacio-volcanic systems are deduced from glacier physics, with distinctly different implications in each case for the resultant lithofacies architecture. Glacier hydraulic considerations and facies analysis are {{used to describe the}} evolution of one of the satellite centres (Icefall Nunatak). The nunatak was constructed from several vents during three main stages. Each stage demonstrates different aspects of englacial volcano construction, mainly in a flooded vault or lacustrine setting. An initial mainly effusive phase was dominated by lava and cogenetic joint-block breccia, and eruption was probably confined mainly within an englacial vault or lake (stage I). Renewed activity, at a different vent and beneath a re-established ice sheet (stage II), began with coarse sediments flushed away subglacially. A subaqueous tuff cone was then constructed in an englacial lake, from explosively erupted coarse glassy tephra probably produced mainly during sustained eruptions and distributed by high-density turbidity currents. Fine detritus is common only in the basal tuff cone unit, possibly as a result of lower, denser (largely subaqueous?) eruption columns. A spectacular slope failure is represented by numerous large blocks, which were displaced to low elevations on extensively <b>fractured</b> tuff <b>cone</b> flanks, and the failure event may have initiated zones of high pore-water discharge. Stage II culminated with two phases of lava delta progradation, indicating that the volcanic edifice ultimately penetrated the entire ice-sheet thickness and that the vent became emergent. Stage III commenced with lava effusion, probably through a thin re-formed cover of permeable snow and firn. A small cinder cone was also constructed and was partially palagonitized because of its structural position on top of a water-saturated volcanic pile and likely presence of vent intrusions driving hydrothermal circulation. ...|$|R

It is a line of volcanic escoria cones of fissural nature lying on a west-northwest-east-southeast orientation consisting of basaltic volcanism of low explosivity. The peninsula shows varying volcanic shapes and products resulting from surtseyan, Hawaiian and strombolian phases of volcanism. It is area of young rock (less than 10.000 years), overlying the older pyroclasts of the Caldeira Formation, and includes two historical eruptions (the 1672 Cabeço do Fogo and 1957 Capelinhos eruptions).

40|$|Abstract. In this research, {{variations}} of tensile properties and fracture behavior of 316 L {{austenitic stainless steel}} weld metal {{as a function of}} aging temperature and time have been investigated. Stainless steel plates were butt-welded using GTAW process. Weld metal tensile specimens were subjected to various aging heat treatments at temperatures of 750 and 850 °C for periods of 1 to 100 hours prior to tensile tests at 25 and 500 °C. Dissolution of delta-ferrite and formation of sigma phase network during aging resulted in a mild increase in tensile strength and significant reduction in ductility, particularly at 25 °C. Although fracture surfaces exhibited ductile features, the dimple morphology and the macroscopic fracture mode were found to be affected by aging. The unaged weld metal exhibited a classic mode of cup and <b>cone</b> <b>fracture,</b> whereas slant and flat types of fracture modes were observed in the aged weld metals, with the slant mode being dominant at 500 °C. The slant mode was associated with deformation localization along arrays of primary voids, nucleated at cracked sigma phase particles, oriented at about 45 ° to loading direction. The transition in the fracture mode is further discussed based on variations in the dimple morphologies and strain hardening exponent...|$|R
40|$|Uniquely {{fractured}} target rocks {{known as}} shatter cones {{are associated with}} more than one half the world's 120 or so presently known impact structures. Shatter cones are a form of tensile rock failure in which a positive conical plug separates from a negative outer cup or mold and delicate ornaments radiating from an apex are preserved on surfaces of both portions. Although distinct, shatter cones are sometimes confused with other striated geologic features such as ventifacts, stylolites, cone-in-cone, slickensides, and artificial blast plumes. Complete cones or solitary cones are rare, occurrences are usually as swarms in thoroughly <b>fractured</b> rock. Shatter <b>cones</b> may form in a zone where an expanding shock wave propagating through a target decays to form an elastic wave. Near this transition zone, the expanding primary wave may strike a pebble or other inhomogeneity whose contrasting transmission properties produce a scattered secondary wave. Interference between primary and secondary scattered waves produce conical stress fields with axes perpendicular to the plane of an advancing shock front. This model supports mechanism capable of producing such shatter cone properties as orientation, apical clasts, lithic dependence, and shock pressure zonation. Although formational mechanics are still poorly understood, shatter cones have become the simplest geologic field criterion for recognizing astroblemes (ancient terrestrial impact structures) ...|$|R

The hollow part can be industrially obtained through cross roll piercing, being the main characteristic {{of this process}} the occurrence of a local failure at the billet centre due to the so-called Mannesmann Effect. The knowledge of those industrial parameters, which determine the start and the propagation of the axial fracture, is crucial because they determine the optimal position of the plug in order to grant both the best quality of the tube and the plug service life. The objective {{of the work is}} to develop a reliable numerical model capable to describe the industrial conditions that lead to Mannesmann fracture through the implementation into a commercial FE code of a coupled damage law based on Continuum Damage Mechanics. The fracture characterization utilises a damage model according to the Lemaitre formulation and the damage parameters identification is based on inverse analysis on hot tensile test results. In particular, a modification to the Lemaitre damage law is adopted in order to describe the different behaviour of the material in the billet section and {{to take into account the}} effect of porosity and phase distribution on the initial damage. Finally, the developed model is validated, through the comparison between numerical results and industrial trials of a non-plug piercing operation, showing that there is a good agreement for what concern the length and the initiation site of the Mannesmann <b>cone</b> <b>fracture...</b>|$|R

In volcanic areas {{the relationships between}} <b>fracture</b> occurrence and <b>cone</b> growth/location are well established. With this in mind, the spatial distribution of the Mount Etna flank cones was analysed {{in order to make}} some inferences about the fracture systems that feed the cones. The positions of the flank cones were acquired by the use of a digital elevation model of the volcano with a geometric resolution of 10 x 10 m. Spatial distribution of the cones was analysed through counting-box and sand-box methods, checking for fractal or multifractal behaviours. The four data sets analysed consist of the whole number of parasitic cones (319), and cones located on the NE (50), south (143) and west (61) rifts, respectively. The cones have a non-trivial power-law distribution. The sand-box method gave the best results with a fractal exponent D-f for all cones of 1. 41 +/- 0. 02 over the length range 0. 2 - 10 km. The same analysis was performed on the other data sets: South Rift (1. 42 +/- 0. 02); West Rift (1. 39 +/- 0. 02); and NE Rift (1. 43 +/- 0. 02), The cones do not have a multifractal distribution, as suggested also by the strong similarity between fractal exponents of the different data sets. Data suggest a strong control over flank <b>cone</b> distribution by <b>fracture</b> length and density.

The structures and fractures of these samples were examined to detect such influences on the fracture behaviour of these materials. The tensile samples of the austenitic steel X 6 CrNiNb 18 10 with a diameter of 3 mm in the uniform section were tested at strain rates of 10 "-" 3, 10 "-" 1, 10, and 200 s"-" 1. In these series, the loss of ductility due to the deformation velocity could be shown. This behaviour was recognizable in the lower necking of the fractures and the tendency to larger dimple diameters in the fracture surfaces. These specimens were compared with another series of tensile tests using geometrically similar specimens of 30 mm diameter. The strain rates during the tensile tests were 10 "-" 3 and 150 s"-" 1. With increasing strain rate and diameter of the gauge length, a decrease of the necking could be determined together with increasing dimple diameter. The tensile samples of the steel 20 MnMoNi 5 5 with 3 and 30 mm diameter were tested again at 10 "-" 3 and 200 s- 1. Under all test conditions, the samples were broken in a ductile mode; either cup and cone, shear or milling cutter type of fractures were observed. As a particular result of the size effect, the 30 mm samples were broken at the low strain rate with a milling cutter type fracture, while the small samples broke with a cup and <b>cone</b> <b>fracture.</b> In the necking {{and the formation of}} the voids in the fracture surface, such an influence of the test parameters could not be observed as could be seen in the austenitic steel.

Long-term exploitation of marine resources is indicated by marine shellfish remains, mainly {{in the form of}} limpets (Patella), recovered from all three cultural periods (Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian). High-level exploitation of rabbits (Oryctolagus) began with initial use of the site and continued throughout the occupations, with a possible increase in intensity {{at the onset of the}} Solutrean. Grease-rendering of red deer (Cervus elaphus), horse (Equus caballus), European ass (Equus hydruntinus) and aurochs (Bos primigenius) bones was identified through multi-dimensional taphonomic and zooarchaeological analyses. Ungulate remains demonstrated extensive fragmentation and abundant evidence of impact features such as <b>cone</b> <b>fractures,</b> crushing, denting and cracking. The intensity of fragmentation and impact damage to red deer remains is significantly correlated with quantities of marrow and bone grease within these portions. Lack of density-mediated attrition of either the leporid remains or the cranial bone of red deer and horse, demonstrates that the loss of low-density, grease-rich post-cranial skeletal portions is due to human subsistence activities. Balanced body-part representation of ungulates indicates that density-mediated attrition of post-cranial elements is not related to differential transport of carcass portions. Comparison of element portion frequencies to food utility indices further demonstrates that humans were systematically harvesting marrow and bone grease throughout the Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian culture periods. The co-occurrence of fire-cracked rock, stone anvils and hammerstones corroborates this suggestion. Although grease rendering at Vale Boi pre-dates other known sites in Eurasia by several thousand years, faunal assemblages in southeastern Spain indicate that resource diversification and intensification appeared there coevally with Vale Boi. The persistence and continued intensification of subsistence practices throughout the Upper Paleolithic suggests a sustained depression of large game in relation to human populations. This was likely due to patchy, spatially-restricted resources, resulting in territorial circumscription. Only through technological innovation and novel approaches to resource harvesting, were foragers able to maintain and ultimately expand their populations in southern Iberia...|$|R
40|$|Various {{types of}} static loading {{stresses}} {{were applied to}} freshly cleaved surfaces formed on glass laths. With increasing applied force the number of linear flaws increased. At high stresses the number per unit area was the same order of magnitude as predicted for the pile up of surface flaws to form a microcrack. The diameter of loop flaws, originating at etch pit sources, increased with stress in agreement with a theoretical prediction based on a vacancy diffusion mechanism. It was postulated that with applied loads the vacancies diffuse into the loop source region and increase the local stress field. This stress is partially relieved by the loop expansion. Higher flaw densities were found by etching during actual stress application than by loading in air followed by placing in the etchant. This difference was explained for samples loaded in air by {{the release of the}} stress causing some of the flaws to disappear before placing in the etchant, whereas loading under the etchant displays the flaws formed during the loading period. Probe experiments showed that the flaw patterns are not the result of a stress release effect in a surface film created by the etching solution. Samples subjected to localized forces, applied under the etchant, disclosed an increase in local flaw concentration in direct proportion to the load. The results appeared to be linear until the typical Hertz <b>cone</b> <b>fracture</b> occurred. At fracture there was a sudden decrease in the flaws formed at the load region. This decrease in flaw concentration at fracture was believed to indicate the combining of flaws to form a microcrack. The importance of surface energy changes on the flaw formation was also shown in quantitative measurements. With decreasing surface energy the flaw length Fl and flaw number Fn also decreased. On aged surfaces the flaw interaction is less extensive and this may explain the reported higher indentation strengths on cleavage surfaces that have been aged. The buildup of flaws and the formation of microcracks also offers a possible explanation for the maximum measured strength of glass being less than one‐half the theoretical value...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{fracture}} of engineering materials involves {{a number of}} science and engineering disciplines. Continuum fracture mechanics is {{deeply rooted in the}} problem of fracture because it treats the relationship between a crack or inhomogeneity and the stress state in a material. Physics and chemistry are important because they help to explain the reactions between the environment and the crack tip. Finally, materials science is essential in understanding the relations among bond rupture, structure, processing and performance of a material. Fracture of materials can be divided into two broad categories - ductile and brittle fracture. Ductile fracture is associated with appreciable plastic deformation. "Cup and cone" fracture demonstrated in metals due to tensile overload {{is a classic example of}} ductile fracture. The different stages of such fracture are shown in Figure l. l(a). At the maximum load, plastic deformation is concentrated in a small gage length of the specimen and necking begins. Once this necked region has formed, fracture begins at the center of the specimen and extends along the dashed lines, finally producing the familiar cup and <b>cone</b> <b>fracture.</b> In fcc metals, plastic deformation continues on the conjugate slip planes until the specimen has necked down to a sharp point. Polycrystalline metals with second phase particles fail due to initiation, growth and coalescence of micro-voids formed in the necked region. Similarly, semicrystalline polymers exhibit necking which leads to localized strengthening of the specimen. Then the specimen elongates due to the propagation of this neck along the gage length. This ductile fracture in polymers is different from that in metals, in which all subsequent deformation is confined to the neck region. Alternatively, brittle fracture is associated with little or no deformation. A brittle material behaves elastically up to the maximum load at which catastrophic failure occurs (Fig. 1. 1 (b)). Silicate glasses are the most common example of such fracture. Brittle fracture is controlled by microscopic inclusions, surface and interior flaws and defects and pores present in the material. An intermediate category of fracture, known as quasi-brittle fracture, has recently been defined. A quasi-brittle material, a title which encompasses many polycrystalline ceramics and cementitious materials, shows measurable deformation prior to failure. The deformation, however, is not associated with dislocation motion. At the onset of nonlinearity in the load-displacement relationship existing flaws in the material start growing and new flaws form (Fig. 1. 1 (c)). Such materials are characterized by a softening curve after the peak load. This softening branch of the load-displacement relationship is associated with stable crack growth in the material before the final fracture. The failed specimen, however, need not look any different from a classically-brittle failed specimen. In a review article such as this, it is useful to first build the necessary background, and various aspects of fracture mechanics are reviewed in the next section. This review is followed by discussions of the microstructural aspects of toughening mechanisms, short crack fracture in comparison to long crack fracture, the statistical nature of fracture and its implications for quasi-brittle materials, and slow crack growth and other environmental effects on various fracture processes are presented. The implications to cementitious materials are discussed throughout...|$|R
40|$|International audienceImpact {{problems}} on reinforced concrete structures are usually computed with models coupling plasticity and isotropic damage. The induced damage anisotropy observed for quasi-brittle {{materials such as}} concrete is often reproduced considering different variables for tension and compression (not consistent with the thermodynamic framework). Introducing viscosity for both damage and plasticity evolutions enables to reproduce the strength enhancement due to rate effects. Such kinds of models present the main advantage to describe precisely each phenomenon locally observed (different rate effects in traction and compression, compaction under confined loadings [...] .) but require {{a large number of}} parameters. Anisotropic damage is quite relevant to describe the micro-cracking pattern and the failure conditions of quasi-brittle materials and structures. In concrete, a state of micro-cracks orthogonal to the loading direction in tension and parallel to it in compression is easily described by a second order damage variable. This anisotropic delay-damage model, used in this work, introduces only few parameters (7 including elasticity parameters E and ν) compared to the ones mentioned higher. The efficiency and the validation of such an approach is illustrated with its application on impacted reinforced concrete beams and dynamic Brazilian tests. The test has been performed with the drop-weight tower ORION of the CEA Saclay for two kinds of beam geometries in order to exhibit flexion and shear rupture. 1 INTRODUCTION The challenge of understanding the behavior of civil engineering structures under dynamic loading is usually linked to security issues but also some economic problems. Advances in instrumentation continue to improve our understanding on these subjects, so one continues around the world to develop impact tests on reinforced concrete structures. The civil engineering is one area where the tests are the most numerous. Indeed, it's only repeating the experiments and varying the parameters that we managed to understand the behavior of structures. But few cases where experiments are conducted on real structures with the stresses actually envisaged, are available. Moreover these experiments do not always provide more information than mockup models. Therefore, we find in the literature a large number of tests on simple structures such as slabs or beams. The philosophy of these kind of tests is to demonstrate on simple structures (beams, slabs) a number of local and global phenomena to allow modeling of more complex cases. Tests developed in the Dynamics Laboratory (DYN) of the CEA Saclay during this work include in this perspective. Two types of tests on a drop-weight tower were made: dynamic Brazilian tests and impact tests on beams. The dynamic Brazilian tests are relatively uncommon in the literature ((Tedesco, Ross, and Kuennen 1993) made the first dynamic Brazilian tests on split Hopkinson bars), but very interesting. A fast digital camera has been used in addition to more traditional, but precise and efficient, instrumentations (accelerometer, displacement measurement by camera, force sensors). The recorded images are analyzed by Digital Image Correlation with the software CORRELI developed at the LMT Cachan (Besnard, Hild, and Roux 2006). The impact tests on beams were designed to study the transition from a ductile failure mode (flexural) to a brittle <b>fracture</b> mode (shear <b>cone).</b> The two factors influencing this study are the slenderness of the beam and the transverse reinforcement (stirrups). An anisotropic delay-damage model has been developed during this work and it is presented in the last section. Finally this model is used to model the tests realized on the drop-weight tower...|$|R
