500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN gave {{a glowing}} review, giving the episode a 9 out of 10, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} [...] "amazing." [...] He wrote that [...] "most of the major mysteries established this season are given a satisfying and proper conclusion." [...] He praised how the episode combined all the second season storylines, including the mysteries and the Neptune High portion of Veronica's life. [...] "The final scenes <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> nice job of closing the high school chapter of the Veronica Mars story, while also leaving plenty {{of questions about the}} future of some characters in particular." [...] Goldman also lauded the performances of Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantoni, writing that [...] "As always, Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantoni knock it out of the park, with Bell especially having to go through a rather stunning amount of emotional transitions, all of which she does spectacularly." ...|$|E
500|$|Certain reviewers {{have also}} commented {{negatively}} about Perry and his subplot, which Sherry Robinson of the St. Petersburg Times considers [...] "pretty trippy." [...] Kevin McDonough of Sun Coast Today {{described it as}} [...] "complicated" [...] and [...] "loosely connected" [...] {{to the rest of}} the series, writing that he is [...] "not sure what this accomplishes except to add the noise of explosions to the already constant din of singing and screaming." [...] Ed Liu of Toon Zone feels it is [...] "truly puzzling what Perry the secret agent is doing in this show in the first place." [...] Liu considers his subplot to be a type of [...] "throw everything against the wall and see what sticks" [...] element and writes that [...] "many of the earlier episodes of the show don't manage to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good job of balancing the subplot and the main one." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, Most Wanted {{was seen}} to be [...] "a no-brainer" [...] for a series pick-up by {{industry}} insiders. However, in early May it {{was said to be}} [...] "cooling" [...] and [...] "not considered the lock it once was". At that time, the producers were prepping [...] "if-come" [...] orders, [...] "deals with writers that will come into effect in the event a pilot is picked [...] to series". On May 12, 2016, the pilot was passed on by ABC, with Lee's successor Channing Dungey explaining that Most Wanted [...] "did not feel as strong as some of the other pilots that we shot. We talked about it with Marvel and we all came to an agreement that we want {{to figure out what the}} next show is that we do together, is something that we all feel is as creatively strong as it can be." [...] However, Dungey said that ABC was open to the series being shopped to another network if Marvel found [...] "another home" [...] for it. Loeb also acknowledged this possibility, but said that the series was designed [...] "to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> specific thing" [...] alongside S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC.|$|E

2500|$|Spurrier {{spoke about}} his NFL {{coaching}} experience during SEC Media Days in 2014. [...] "When I left Florida after 12 years, I thought I {{was going to}} coach in the NFL {{five or six years}} and retire to the beach, and play golf a bunch, and travel around, this, that and the other. But that was a bad plan. It was. Later you found out that was not a real good idea. But that's the way I was thinking back then.". [...] After retiring from coaching, Spurrier further reflected on his NFL stint in several interviews. In a 2016 appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show, Spurrier reflected that the Redskins might not have been the best choice for his jump to the NFL. [...] "I went to the team that offered the most money instead of the best situation", he said. And in 2015, he told David Feherty that, [...] "The owner and the personnel guys, they picked the team. I couldn’t even pick the quarterback the second year. So I knew it wasn’t going to work, but that's ok. I probably didn’t <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good job, and the situation wasn’t what I was looking for, so {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have many}} friends in America, and feel a {{grateful}} interest in the country.
