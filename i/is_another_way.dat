5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>way</b> in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E

25|$|The {{symmetry}} {{groups of}} the Platonic solids are a special class of three-dimensional point groups known as polyhedral groups. The high degree of symmetry of the Platonic solids can be interpreted {{in a number of}} ways. Most importantly, the vertices of each solid are all equivalent under the action of the symmetry group, as are the edges and faces. One says the action of the symmetry group is transitive on the vertices, edges, and faces. In fact, this <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>way</b> of defining regularity of a polyhedron: a polyhedron is regular if and only if it is vertex-uniform, edge-uniform, and face-uniform.|$|E
25|$|A common metric used to {{quantify}} food web trophic structure is food chain length. Food chain length <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>way</b> of describing food webs {{as a measure}} of the number of species encountered as energy or nutrients move from the plants to top predators. There are different ways of calculating food chain length depending on what parameters of the food web dynamic are being considered: connectance, energy, or interaction. In its simplest form, the length of a chain is the number of links between a trophic consumer and the base of the web. The mean chain length of an entire web is the arithmetic average of the lengths of all chains in a food web.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the people}} in these {{countries}} have become educated enough and they realize {{their place in the}} world economy, they can also demand help from the core countries. Although unlikely, {{due to the fact that}} the core countries rely on the exploitation of the periphery, there have been pushes for core countries to help better the periphery countries. Some of the ideas suggested are to help aid the periphery countries in developing by exploiting them less, help the periphery countries lose some of their debt and raise the prices on goods coming from these countries to allow them to be more profitable. These policies are obviously not beneficial to the core countries and is mostly why they have never been adapted successfully but this <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>way</b> in which the periphery could rise to a higher status.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{situation}} occurs in general relativity with the gravitational singularity {{associated with the}} Schwarzschild solution that describes the geometry of a black hole. The curvature of spacetime at the singularity is infinite which <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>way</b> of stating that the theory does not describe the physical conditions at this point. It is hoped that {{the solution to this}} paradox will be found with a consistent theory of quantum gravity, something which has thus far remained elusive. A consequence of this paradox is that the associated singularity that occurred at the supposed starting point of the universe (see Big Bang) is not adequately described by physics. Before a theoretical extrapolation of a singularity can occur, quantum mechanical effects become important in an era known as the Planck time. Without a consistent theory, there can be no meaningful statement about the physical conditions associated with the universe before this point.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} Roman Catholic Church in the Western {{world has been}} {{experiencing}} a decline in vocations to the priesthood and religious life since the 1960s, a relatively simple way to assess the vigour of this order is to compare the numbers of those in solemn profession (vows) with those in simple profession. For a mendicant order such as the Augustinians, the most formal and significant commitments are the permanent and lifelong vows of Solemn profession. Ordination is considered a separate matter, and though most are, the Augustinian friar {{may or may not}} be ordained priest or deacon. Those in simple profession are the newer members of the order, but have agreed to make a serious commitment (temporary, but with a view to permanent commitment), and been formally accepted as suitable by senior members of the order to make that formal commitment. The figures quoted do not include aspirants to the order who have not reached the significant step of simple profession. The details of the median age of friars in respective national grouping <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>way</b> of assessing the vigour of the order, but these details are not included here. They may be found on the order's international website. Likewise, the growth of lay organisations of Augustinian spirituality is another (less-precise) way of measuring the vigour of the order.|$|E

He wanted the music to evoke emotions in the player. Silent Hill 2 makes extensive use of sound effects ranging from screams to footsteps on broken glass.
