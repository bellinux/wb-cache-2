Leng identifies this quality in two lines in the song's final verse: [...] "The wiser you may be / The harder <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> see". Leng presents three possible interpretations for this couplet: [...] "another play on the blind seer idea"; Harrison's rejection of the concept espoused in his 1968 Beatles composition [...] "The Inner Light", [...] "that knowledge is the key to enlightenment"; or, like his 1975 rebuttal to detractors such as Rolling Stone, [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", a [...] "dig at smartass rock journalists".|$|E

GameSpot mentioned that the [...] "great sense of humor" [...] of the original game is also noticeable in Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando, a statement echoed by GameZone when they said that the game's cut-scenes [...] "represent some of the most thought-out and gut-wrenchingly funny sequences ever witnessed in a platforming game." ...|$|E

In an interview with The San Bernardino Sun, Wade talked about making songs on the album and said, [...] "This time around it was not about having any preconceived notions. It was about letting the tape machine roll and getting the music down spontaneously." [...] When asked about {{the message of the}} song, Wade said, [...] "I think the main message of this song, at least for me personally when I was writing the lyrics, is just how difficult <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> be in a relationship. Sometimes, you do things to disappoint the other person. Letting someone down and trying to repair a relationship that you feel is kind of slipping through your hands a bit." [...] "Whatever It Takes" [...] was originally released with the band's fourth studio album, Who We Are, on June 18, 2007 and was officially solicited as a single to mainstream radio on November 13, 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Rodríguez's {{and a body}} to {{remember}} with, {{a collection of short}} stories, has been described as an exploration of [...] "how hard <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> re-root oneself" [...] during exile. The Spanish version of the book is entitled De cuerpo entero and was, like the English version, also published in 1997, though the works are subtly different; as Rodríguez seeks to evoke feelings in the reader that are relevant to each culture. This text explores life in exile, and how [...] "forgetting [...] is not an option". It delves into the difficulties an immigrant or displaced person experiences, whether they affect the person directly or indirectly. Rodríguez's book, in both languages, focuses on the experiences of migration and immigration of women, making sure to assess the physical and emotional adjustments that must be made, adding another woman's perspective and experience to the book through each narrative. The book's main characters are all women, and with each story Rodríguez's use of the body, [...] "the fullness of the body, its terrible fragmentation, or the body as a void" [...] is used to express the experiences of the characters. Rodríguez often purposely defragments the voices and bodies of her protagonists to give a sense of urgency.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user {{messages}} for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. [...] "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA {{also referred to as}} the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," [...] the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. [...] It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> take that information down once it is out in the open. [...] This is becoming a bigger issue now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago. [...] In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and {{it is important to consider}} that when interacting online. [...] New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. [...] What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances. [...] Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics. [...] No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.|$|E

Zap2it posed {{the question of who}} Jason should reconnect with romantically upon his arrival—his wife Sam or former love Elizabeth Webber. Over 50% of readers responded that Jason should reconnect with Sam. Miller and Monaco's Jason and Sam shared their first scenes, since Jason's return, on October 2. Despite Jason being unconscious, the scenes were described as [...] "breathtaking." [...] Jennifer Snyder of TV Source Magazine remarked that she could [...] "easily see Miller and Monaco sparking chemistry." [...] A re-post of the scenes on General Hospitals Facebook account received over 95,000 likes from viewers, and Monaco received favorable reviews for her performance in the scenes. Following more recent scenes between Miller and Monaco, Coryon Gray of TV Source Magazine, described the duo as having [...] "a huge heaping amount of chemistry ... that shoots right off the meters." [...] Dorathy Gass of Fame10 Entertainment stated that Miller added a [...] "unique twist" [...] to the chemistry the couple shares and commented that Miller and Monaco would have no problem reigniting the passion that Jason and Sam share. [...] Hope Campbell of Soap Shows noted how difficult <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> recast one-half of a supercouple, but affirmed that Miller and Monaco have portrayed just as much chemistry as Burton and Monaco. Campbell also applauded Miller, Monaco and the writers for their creation of [...] "a new [...] "Jasam" [...] mixed in with the old and the continuation of an epic soap opera love story." [...] Entertainment Weekly called Miller and Monaco's chemistry [...] "quite undeniable," [...] while General Hospital described their love story as [...] "one for the books." [...] In 2015, Jason and Sam were named the second greatest General Hospital couple of all time by Fame10 Entertainment. In 2016, [...] "JaSam" [...] placed as runner up for Best Fandom in E! Online's annual TV Scoop Awards, beating out 30 other popular primetime couples. [...] Jason and Sam were the only daytime couple with enough nominations to earn a spot in the competition.|$|E
