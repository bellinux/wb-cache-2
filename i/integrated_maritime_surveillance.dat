40|$|The European Council {{adopted the}} first EU Sustainable Development Strategy in 2001 (Gothenburg strategy), later on ambitiously updated in June 2006. The {{mainstreaming}} in the maritime domain is the Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP) launched in 2007. This commentary provides a critical mid-term review {{on the status}} of IMP implementation, outlining the successes and failures of the implementation process from a governance perspective. The review focuses on the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Surveillance,</b> one of the pillars of the Integrated Maritime Policy, using this as a case study for evaluating the implementation progress against the stated objectives and the associated governance model. The outcome suggests that while the EU Integrated Maritime Policy has stimulated a lot of interest for a new maritime vision at EU level and has initiated important steps towards its implementation, including new maritime governance paradigm, so far it has failed to promote the necessary changes to boost the cooperative and sustainable environment it has claimed to do. In the particular case of the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Surveillance,</b> despite the strong political commitment of the European Commission and the considerable budget expenditure, the EU still {{has not been able to}} achieve the targeted Common Information Sharing Environment, failing an important milestone towards building sustainability in the maritime domain...|$|E

40|$|Surface wave (SW) over-the-horizon (OTH) radars are {{not only}} widely used for ocean remote sensing, {{but they can also}} be {{exploited}} in <b>integrated</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems. This paper represents {{the first part of the}} description of the statistical and spectral analysis performed on sea backscattered signals recorded by the oceanographic WEllen RAdar (WERA) system. Data were collected on May 13 th 2008 in the Bay of Brest, France. The data statistical analysis, after beamforming, shows that for near range cells the signal amplitude fits well the Rayleigh distribution, while for far cells the data show a more pronounced heavy-tailed behavior. The causes can be traced in man-made (i. e. radio communications) and/or natural (i. e. reflections of the transmitted signal through the ionosphere layers, meteor trails) interferences...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- An {{architecture}} {{has been}} proposed for an <b>integrated</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>surveillance</b> (IMS) system to support Canada’s defense efforts in a network-centric or information-centric surveillance of the Canadian coasts, where many sensors, for example, HF radar, surface search radar, Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) and imaging radar are used to gather information about the targets of interest. Typically, a realistic IMS system is a distributed one where the information processing is carried out {{in a number of}} locations and at different levels (e. g., local IMS, regional IMS or national surveillance center). This paper will discuss IMS, propose an architecture for an IMS system and give some specifications for the proposed IMS system. The paper will describe the implemented data fusion engine. Desirable features are also given in the paper...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} organizations, both {{national}} and international, have put significant efforts in developing knowledge-based <b>integrated</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>surveillance</b> (IMS) systems. The final aim {{is to have a}} clear picture of the position, classification, identification and movement of cooperative and non-cooperative targets entering and leaving the 200 nautical miles limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Each sensor (i. e. satellite-based, ground-based, shipborne or airborne) has its own task and, in such a context, high frequency (HF) surface wave (SW) radars are inexpensive tools for long range early warning applications in open waters. They allow maximizing the effectiveness in dealing with fisheries protection, drug interdiction, illegal immigration, terrorist threats, search and rescue tasks. This paper focuses on the possibility of combining automatic identification system (AIS) data with HFSWR data for vessel detection and classification purposes. Three algorithms for target detection in compound Gaussian HF sea clutter are presented and their performance evaluated. The combined use of AIS plots provided by cooperative targets can allow the operator to discriminate non-cooperative targets and possible threats. The concurrent exploitation of AIS and HFSWR data is presented and discussed by means of real data recorded during the NURC experiment in the northern Tyrrhenian Sea in May 2009...|$|E

This thesis analyses {{the evolution of the}} Australian Customs Services 2 ̆ 7 role in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>maritime</b> <b>surveillance</b> and border protection. The analysis framework is built around policy, financial and legal influences and developments. The thesis recommends implementing a comprehensive harmonized strategy for early detection and effective responses. This thesis argues that there are only two organisations capable of sustaining an effective <b>maritime</b> <b>surveillance</b> and enforcement capacity and they are the Australian Customs Service (Customs) and the Australian Defence Force (ADF). The suggestion that a single Australian coastguard organisation is another option is analysed in this thesis and discounted. The thesis looks at Customs evolution in <b>maritime</b> <b>surveillance</b> and border protection from pre-Federation to mid 2005 and forecasts some alternatives that could advance <b>maritime</b> <b>surveillance</b> and protection policy. This thesis is important because competing world priorities, including terrorism versus trade, in turn, can lead to rapid policy competition for government funding, which can lead to poor policy choices...|$|R

40|$|Maritime Situational Awareness is the {{understanding}} of anything associated with the maritime domain that could impact the security, safety, economy, or environment. The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) has developed the Blue Hub as an in-house R&D platform for <b>integrated</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>surveillance</b> and maritime situational awareness. It is applied, for example, to support counter-piracy around Africa, and to monitor the growing ship traffic in the Arctic. In order to improve maritime awareness and support risk assessment, the JRC has started to integrate data from the marine science community. In particular the JRC is interested in using forecasts from operational ocean models and weather models. For the Blue Hub, message brokering and data mediation has become an essential tool for the accessing of ocean forecast data {{as quickly as possible}} in easy to use formats. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) is making global oceanography data available through the Environmental Research Division's Data Access Program (ERDDAP) data broker. ERDDAP provides RESTful machine to machine communication, data brokering and data mediation by converting data to a number of standard and developer friendly ways, including some Open Geospatial Consortium formats. In this presentation we demonstrate how data brokering and mediation is making complex scientific data efficiently accessible. We show how such data is being integrated into the Blue Hub system to enhance maritime situational awareness. JRC. G. 3 -Maritime affair...|$|E
40|$|The European Atlas of the Seas {{offers a}} {{snapshot}} of environmental and socio-economic features that characterize the coastal and marine environment. The latest release (Version 4) addresses the public in general, but also non-specialist experts involved with environmental issues, human activities or policies related to Europe's coasts and seas. The information content of the Atlas comprises a series of geographical layers, subdivided in “background maps”, “thematic maps” (i. e. maritime Europe, natural setting, sea bottom, sea level rise, security, transport, tourism, energy, wind, fisheries and fish consumption) and “do-it-yourself maps” (dealing with marine knowledge, nature and environment, socio-economics, fisheries, aquaculture, transport, energy, sea bed mining, coastal tourism, Maritime Spatial Planning, <b>integrated</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and international ocean governance). All maps follow consistent cartographic rules and can be extracted for external use. The Atlas database is updated regularly, but historical data remain accessible after the updates, so that time series may be constructed. Tools for map exploration and combination {{can be used to}} combine together more layers, providing professional users with analysis and interpretation capabilities, to couple data into graphical indicators. The Atlas aims to supports also policy making, on marine environment, maritime issues and economic sectors, both within and outside the European Institutions (e. g. on Common Fisheries Policy or Maritime Spatial Planning). Further, it expands the same support to near-coastal issues and matters related to land-sea interactions. The web application for accessing Atlas contents offers links to other Marine Information Systems, and is available to a broad audience from computers, tablets and mobile devices. JRC.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} with {{the analysis of}} data collected by two low-power surface wave (SW) over-the-horizon (OTH) radars. The two systems, developed at the University of Hamburg and named Wellen Radar (WERA), concurrently operate in a real maritime surveillance scenario in the Bay of Brest (France), with the double purpose of both sea current sensing and vessel detection. The research activity presented in this dissertation develops following the second topic and {{is interested in the}} statistical analysis of recorded data and then in the consequent ship detection. Part I deals with the statistical analysis of sea clutter in the HF band. Detailed investigations have been carried out on which is the best statistical model. Numerical results have shown interesting features, both before and after beamforming. The clutter amplitude is Rayleigh or Weibull distributed for the majority of near and middle-range cells, while it cannot be fitted very accurately by the most common amplitude distributions at long distances. This is caused by the highly impulsive nature of interferences, both man-made and natural, which mask the clutter signal. The resulting signal, however, can still be modeled as a compound-Gaussian (CG) process, as verified by an in depth analysis of the probability density functions (PDFs) of both the speckle and texture signal components. The spectral features of the signal have been studied as well. They demonstrated to be a precious tool for recovering information about the nature of non-Gaussianities. Finally, the signal spectrum has been described as an auto-regressive (AR) model. Part II is instead focused on the application of decision-based techniques. Starting from the previous results, our investigation develops on the analysis of detection algorithms based on the normalized adaptive matched filter (NAMF) and the impact of clutter non-stationarities on detection performance. To deal with the unknown clutter statistics, three covariance matrix estimators, namely the sample covariance matrix (SCM), the normalized sample covariance matrix (NSCM) and the fixed point covariance matrix (FPCM), or approximate maximum likelihood (AML), are investigated and their performances evaluated. The idea is to capitalize these results and exploit WERA for detecting ships well beyond the horizon in a complex <b>integrated</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>surveillance</b> (IMS) scenario. The final superposition of WERA detection maps and automatic identification system (AIS) ground truth data will allow to quantify the goodness of the algorithms. In this sense, guidelines about future work are provided as well...|$|E
