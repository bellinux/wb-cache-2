Given strong evidence that CIRP holds, the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis {{can serve as a}} test to determine whether UIRP holds (in order for the forward rate and spot rate to be equal, both CIRP and UIRP conditions must hold). Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and future spot rate, is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both <b>empirical</b> <b>support</b> and empirical failure of the hypothesis.|$|E

25|$|Building on Maslow's theory, Clayton Alderfer (1959) {{collapsed}} {{the levels}} in Maslow's theory {{from five to}} three: existence, relatedness and growth.

25|$|Because of {{the strong}} <b>empirical</b> <b>support</b> for special relativity, any {{modifications}} to it must necessarily be quite subtle and difficult to measure.

25|$|Although Maslow's {{theory is}} widely known, in the {{workplace}} it {{has proven to be}} a poor predictor of employee behavior. Maslow theorized that people will not seek to satisfy a higher level need until their lower level needs are met.

She argued that despite this the ideas of multiple non-g intelligences are very attractive to many due to the suggestion that everyone can be smart in some way.|$|E

25|$|Scrying {{has been}} practised in many {{cultures}} {{in the belief that}} it can reveal the past, present, or future. Some practitioners assert that visions that come when one stares into the media are from the subconscious or imagination, while others say that they come from gods, spirits, devils, or the psychic mind, depending on the culture and practice. There is neither any systematic body of <b>empirical</b> <b>support</b> for any such views in general however, nor for their respective rival merits; individual preferences in such matters are arbitrary at best.|$|E

25|$|The stages model, {{which came}} {{about in the}} 1960s, is a theory based on {{observation}} {{of people who are}} dying, not people who experienced the death of a loved one. This model found <b>empirical</b> <b>support</b> in a study by Maciejewski et al. The research of George Bonanno, however, is acknowledged as inadvertently debunking the five stages of grief because his large body of peer-reviewed studies show {{that the vast majority of}} people who have experienced a loss do not grieve, but are resilient. The logic is that if there is no grief, there are no stages to pass through.|$|E

A {{wide range of}} intervention approaches is available, including modeling and reinforcement, adult and peer mediation strategies, peer tutoring, social games and stories, self-management, pivotal response therapy, video modeling, direct instruction, visual cuing, Circle of Friends and social-skills groups. A 2007 meta-analysis of 55 studies of school-based social skills intervention found that they were minimally effective for children and adolescents with ASD, and a 2007 review found that social skills training has minimal <b>empirical</b> <b>support</b> for children with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism.|$|E
25|$|Goal-setting Theory {{has strong}} <b>empirical</b> <b>support</b> dating back thirty years. However, {{there are some}} {{boundary}} conditions that indicate in some situations, goal-setting can be detrimental to performance on certain types of tasks. Goals require a narrowing of one's focus, so for more complex or creative tasks, goals can actually inhibit performance because they demand cognitive resources. Similarly, when someone is learning a new task, performance-related goals can distract from the learning process. During the learning process, it may be better to focus on mastering the task than achieving a particular result. Finally, too many goals can become distracting and counterproductive, especially if they conflict with one another.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{proposed}} origins include French jaser, {{meaning to}} chatter or chat, and French chasser, meaning to chase or hunt. Daniel Cassidy, a film-maker, musician, and writer, has {{argued for a}} derivation from Irish teas, which is pronounced (according to Cassidy) [...] "jass" [...] and means [...] "heat" [...] or [...] "passion". However, Cassidy's level of scholarship was consistently poor and the word teas would be pronounced tyass or chass, not jass. Although they cannot be ruled out absolutely, such derivations lack <b>empirical</b> <b>supporting</b> evidence and must be considered speculative at best, and highly improbable {{in the case of}} Cassidy's work.|$|R

25|$|Many {{alternative}} therapies and interventions are available, ranging from elimination diets to chelation therapy. Few {{are supported by}} scientific studies. Treatment approaches lack <b>empirical</b> <b>support</b> in quality-of-life contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing, training availability, and parent requests. Even {{if they do not}} help, conservative treatments such as changes in diet are expected to be harmless aside from their bother and cost. Dubious invasive treatments are a much more serious matter: for example, in 2005, botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old boy with autism.|$|E
25|$|The {{maternal}} deprivation hypothesis, attachment theory's precursor, {{was enormously}} controversial. Ten {{years after the}} publication of the hypothesis, Ainsworth listed nine concerns that she felt were the chief points of controversy. Ainsworth separated the three dimensions of maternal deprivation into lack of maternal care, distortion of maternal care and discontinuity of maternal care. She analysed the dozens of studies undertaken in the field and concluded that the basic assertions of the maternal deprivation hypothesis were sound although the controversy continued. As the formulation of attachment theory progressed, critics commented on <b>empirical</b> <b>support</b> for the theory and for the possible alternative explanations for results of empirical research. Wootton questioned the suggestion that early attachment history (as it would now be called) had a lifelong impact.|$|E
25|$|The {{term was}} coined by Joel Kovel to {{describe}} the subtle racial behaviors of any ethnic or racial group who rationalize their aversion to a particular group by appeal to rules or stereotypes. People who behave in an aversively racial way may profess egalitarian beliefs, and will often deny their racially motivated behavior; nevertheless they change their behavior when dealing {{with a member of}} another race or ethnic group than the one they belong to. The motivation for the change is thought to be implicit or subconscious. Experiments have provided <b>empirical</b> <b>support</b> for the existence of aversive racism. Aversive racism has been shown to have potentially serious implications for decision making in employment, in legal decisions and in helping behavior.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the controversies}} facing bite mark {{analysis}} {{are due to}} the lack of <b>empirical</b> <b>supporting</b> evidence. When searching the entire MedLine database from 1960–1999, only 50 papers in English were found that related to bite mark analysis. Of these 50 papers, most of which were published in the 1980s, only 8% came from well designed experimentation providing empirical data. The lack of research has led to the continued use of a few outdated and limited studies to support the validity of bite mark analysis. This brings into question whether or not there is enough scientific support for bite mark analysis to be employed in court.|$|R
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that any of these assumptions are correct, or even likely. Linguistic opinion is that click consonants may well be a relatively late development in human language, that they are no more resistant to change or any more likely to be linguistic relics than other speech sounds, and that they are easily borrowed: at least one Khoisan language, ǁXegwi, is believed to have reborrowed clicks from Bantu languages, which had earlier borrowed them from Khoisan languages, for example. The Knight and Mountain article {{is the latest in a}} long line of speculations about the primitive origin of click consonants, which have been largely motivated by the outdated idea that primitive people speak primitive languages, which has no <b>empirical</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fowler's {{scientific}} {{research has been}} criticized for methodological weaknesses. Of Fowler's six stages, only the first two found <b>empirical</b> <b>support,</b> and these were heavily based upon Piaget's stages of cognitive development. The tables and graphs in the book were presented {{in such a way that}} the last four stages appeared to be validated, but the requirements of statistical verification of the stages were not met. His study was not published in a journal, so was not peer-reviewed. Other critics of Fowler have questioned whether his ordering of the stages really reflects his own commitment to a rather liberal Christian Protestant outlook, as if to say that people who adopt a similar viewpoint to Fowler are at higher stages of faith development. Nevertheless, the concepts Fowler introduced seemed to hit home with those in the circles of academic religion, and have been an important starting point for various theories and subsequent studies.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} UG plays an {{essential}} role in normal child language acquisition is evident from species differences: for example, children and household pets may be exposed to quite similar linguistic input, but by the age of three years, the child's ability to comprehend multi-word utterances vastly outstrips that of the dog or cat. This evidence is all the more impressive when one considers that most children do not receive reliable correction for grammatical errors. Indeed, even children who for medical reasons cannot produce speech, and therefore have no possibility of producing an error in the first place, have been found to master both the lexicon and the grammar of their community's language perfectly. The fact that children succeed at language acquisition even when their linguistic input is severely impoverished, as it is when no corrective feedback is available, is known as the argument from the poverty of the stimulus, and is another important source of <b>empirical</b> <b>support</b> for a central role of UG in child language acquisition.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge {{management}} (KM) {{and organizational}} performance {{are believed to}} be essential of the success in business. The different results in literatures which declare KM affects organizational performance positively. But there are still some confusing relations between KM and organizational learning (OL). Accordingly, we propose some hypotheses to verify relationships among KM, organizational performance, and organizational learning (OL).

This paper presents OL as a coordinating mechanism, and the results support it in these samples. <b>Empirical</b> evidence also <b>supports</b> the perspective that KM affects organizational performance through OL. This paper is one of the <b>empirical</b> <b>supports</b> for the role of OL as a mediator between KM and organizational performance.
