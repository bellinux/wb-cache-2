5|$|Although French is an {{official}} language {{for the purposes}} of the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act does not require it to be {{an official}} language for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions). Hence, Manitoba's <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level of provincial government services in both official languages. According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba's population spoke only English, 3.2 percent spoke only French, 15.1 percent spoke both, and 0.9 percent spoke neither.|$|E

5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E

25|$|The prime {{minister}} is the President of the Council of Ministers—which holds effective executive power— and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities.

25|$|In this theory, {{sovereign}} <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> financially constrained in {{its ability}} to spend; it is argued that the government can afford to buy anything that is for sale in currency that it issues (there may be political constraints, like a debt ceiling law). The only constraint is that excessive spending by any sector of the economy (whether households, firms or public) has the potential to cause inflationary pressures.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} Buddhist monastic sites {{emerged in the}} Deccan region during the Satavahana period. However, the exact {{relations}} between these monasteries and the Satavahana <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> clear. The Pandavleni Caves inscription issued {{during the reign of}} Kanha states that the cave was excavated by maha-matra (officer-in-charge) of the shramanas (non-Vedic ascetics). Based on this, Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya concludes that Kanha favoured Buddhism, and had an administrative department dedicated to the welfare of Buddhist monks.|$|E
25|$|If the Head of <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{satisfied}} with the Council, he may request that the Co-Princes dissolve the Council and order new elections.

25|$|Since the {{majority}} of the school buildings are above their standards, the <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> responsible for the school's maintenance. Replacements of plant and machinery as well as the upkeeping of existing facilities require substantial sums of money.

25|$|Belgium is {{a federal}} state made up of three {{communities}} and three regions, each with considerable autonomy.

The Walloon Region's autonomy extends even to foreign policy; Wallonia is entitled to pursue its own foreign policy, including the signing of treaties, and in many domains even the Belgian federal <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> able to sign an international treaty without the agreement of the Parliament of Wallonia.|$|E
