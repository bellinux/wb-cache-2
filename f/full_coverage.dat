5|$|Although the 2012 Olympic men's {{basketball}} tournament was then {{more than a}} year away, qualifying tournaments in all five of FIBA's continental zones were to be held in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2011 (the traditional basketball offseason throughout the world). The lockout resulted in the suspension of an agreement between the NBA and FIBA by which the NBA would take on most of the costs for insuring the value of its players' contracts in the event they were injured during international competition. As a result, national federations that wish to have NBA players on their squads must now provide <b>full</b> <b>coverage</b> instead of supplemental insurance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to understand the}} factors of the slow progress in the coverage of basic childhood immunisation in India using three rounds of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data. States are {{selected on the basis}} of changes in <b>full</b> immunisation <b>coverage</b> during 1992 - 2005. Bivariate, multivariate, and dropout rates are used to understand the dif ferentials and changes in immunisation coverage. The result reveals substantial improvement in partial immunisation in most states; however, the increase in <b>full</b> immunisation <b>coverage</b> has been slower. Two crucial determinants of the <b>full</b> immunisation <b>coverage</b> in selected states are availability of health card and antenatal care (ANC) visits of mother. Fur ther, higher drop out of DPT 3 and measles are responsible for slow increase in <b>full</b> immunisation <b>coverage</b> in selected states. The dropout rate between BCG - measles remains very high. The measles vaccination is very poorly addressed in India, due to which full immunisation is low. Mother’s education, standard of living, mass media exposure, and availability of health card are appeared as significant predictor in explaining the <b>full</b> immunisation <b>coverage</b> irrespective of time. Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression analysis are used in the study. Results indicate a steady increase in <b>coverage</b> of <b>full</b> immunisation in last 14 years, while the increase was higher during 1992 - 19 98 but lower during 1998 - 2005. </span...|$|R

Toward {{the end of}} 1981, it published an article linking Prime Minister Price and Minister Louis Sylvester to a report from Mexico about drugs in Belize. For {{the second time in}} its publishing life, Amandala went to court on the wrong end of lawsuits for libel, and was hit with separate judgements for BZ $10,000 and BZ $7,500 in 1982 and 1983.

25|$|Bruxism {{can cause}} {{significant}} tooth wear {{if it is}} severe, and sometimes dental restorations (crowns, fillings etc.) are damaged or lost, sometimes repeatedly. Most dentists therefore prefer to keep dental treatment in people with bruxism very simple and only carry it out when essential, since any dental work is likely to fail in the long term. Dental implants and complex bridgework for example are relatively contraindicated in bruxists. In the case of crowns, {{the strength of the}} restoration becomes more important, sometimes at the cost of aesthetic considerations. E.g. a <b>full</b> <b>coverage</b> gold crown, which has a degree of flexibility and also involves less removal (and therefore less weakening) of the underlying natural tooth may be more appropriate than other types of crown which are primarily designed for esthetics rather than durability. Porcelain veneers on the incisors are particularly vulnerable to damage, and sometimes a crown can be perforated by occlusal wear.|$|E
25|$|Calderón {{created the}} largest number of {{universities}} (96) in the history of Mexico. He was also the only president who granted <b>full</b> <b>coverage</b> and a secure spot in elementary schools to children from 6 to 11 years old. The Office of Social Aid for Victims of Violence (in Spanish: Procuraduría Social para Víctimas de la Violencia) was created by him in 2011. During Calderón's administration, more than 1,000 hospitals were created, and more than 2,000 were reconstructed and amplified. During Vicente Fox's administration, only 40 million people had access to a public health care system. Currently, more than 100 million Mexicans have access to their country's health care system due to Calderón's effort to implement a universal health care system. Moreover, Calderón created more than 16,500 kilometers of interstate highways. Calderón also dispatched military forces all over Mexico since the beginning of his presidency to put down the drug cartels and the increasing violence generated by the criminal organizations that fight with rival groups for territory.|$|E

The Vigra Transmitter was closed in 2011 and Røst followed the following year, leaving Ingøy as the only AM transmitter in Norway. The Parliament of Norway decided in 2011 that the FM network would be closed in 2017 or 2019, with <b>full</b> <b>coverage</b> being ready in 2014. The only parliamentary party to oppose the transition was the Progress Party. The decision resulted in a large-scale expansion of the DAB network in Norway. NRK stated that the longer overlap period, compared to that of television, would give significantly higher broadcasting costs. Following the closure of TV3 in February 2012 and as all other channels were being broadcast on Multiplex A, Norkring decided to close its Slovenian network. Norkring was awarded the second DAB multiplex in an auction held by the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority in 2012, where the company bid NOK4 million. The multiplex has a capacity for fifteen DAB+ channels.|$|E

ITV, BBC, and CNN covered the ceremony and associated events live through the combined pool of footage from the BBC, Sky, and ITN to help cover the overall cost. In North America, which is five to nine hours behind British Summer Time, the wedding occurred during the time usually taken up by network breakfast television programmes, which expanded their normal length to allow for <b>full</b> <b>coverage.</b> NBC's Today began coverage at 4am Eastern Time, and along with MSNBC, partnered with ITV. ABC partnered with BBC, CBS has its own live London affiliates, and Fox and Fox News Channel partnered with their sister network Sky News. The CBC and CTV had live coverage. Cable networks and radio also had live coverage. In Mexico, the wedding aired on Televisa and TV Azteca; all television stations in Mexico carrying the ceremony stayed on the air during the late night hours instead of normally signing off. The ABC also took the BBC feed in Australia, in addition with pay TV channel UKTV. Coverage was also provided on the Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten. The ABC had planned to produce alternative commentary with The Chaser, but {{in response to these}} plans, the BBC barred the use of its footage for such a purpose, on orders from Clarence House. The royal wedding was also streamed live online on YouTube via the British Monarchy's official The Royal Channel. In Croatia the wedding was broadcast on Doma TV, while in Serbia the wedding was broadcast on Radio Television of Serbia and B92 Info. Live broadcast in China was done by CCTV News and Phoenix Info News. In Portugal, the wedding was covered by RTP and TVI. The wedding was also widely followed through various cable and local channels in India and Pakistan. In the Philippines, the wedding was broadcast on ABS-CBN, GMA and TV5, with all three networks sending their own reporters at London. In Ireland the wedding was broadcast on RTÉ One and TV3. Marty Whelan and Mary Kennedy provided commentary for RTÉ Television, while TV3 took a live feed of ITV's coverage.|$|E
