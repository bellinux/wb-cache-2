40|$|<b>Integrated</b> <b>optoelectronics</b> {{has seen}} its rapid {{development}} in the past decade. From its original primary application in long-haul optical communications and access network, <b>integrated</b> <b>optoelectronics</b> has expanded itself to data center, consumer electronics, energy harness, environmental sensing, biological and medical imaging, industry manufacture control etc. This revolutionary progress benefits from the advancement in light generation, manipulation, detection and its interaction with other systems. Device innovation is the key in this advancement. Together they build up the component library for <b>integrated</b> <b>optoelectronics,</b> which facilities the system integration. High contrast grating (HCG) is an emerging element in <b>integrated</b> <b>optoelectronics.</b> Compared to the other elements, HCG has very rich properties and design flexibility. Some of them are fascinating and extraordinary, such as broadband high reflectivity, and high quality factor resonance - all it needs is a single thin-layer of HCG. Furthermore, {{it can be a}} microelectromechanical structure. These rich properties are readily to be harnessed and turned into novel devices. This dissertation is devoted to investigate the physical origins of the extraordinary features of HCG, and explore its applications in novel devices for <b>integrated</b> <b>optoelectronics.</b> An intuitive picture will be presented to explain the HCG physics. The essence of HCG lies in its superb manipulation of light, which can be coupled to applications in light generation and detection. Various device innovations, such as low-loss hollow-core waveguide, fast optical phased array, tunable VCSEL and detector are demonstrated with the HCG as a key element. This breadth of functionality of HCG suggests that HCG has reached beyond a single element in integrated optoelectronics; it has enabled a new platform for <b>integrated</b> <b>optoelectronics...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{threat of}} nuclear {{proliferation}} remains a critical issue in our society. Prevention requires knowledge, {{and there is no}} greater indicator of the capability and intent of a nation than observation of actual detonation tests being conducted. Ground-based monitoring systems have proven to be very capable in identifying nuclear tests and can provide somewhat precise information on the location and yield of the explosive device. Making these measurements, however, currently requires very expensive and bulky seismometers that are difficult to deploy in places where they are most needed. A high-performance, compact device can enable rapid deployment of large-scale arrays, which can in turn be used to provide higher-quality data during times of critical need.

30|$|Germanium {{nanostructures}} {{have potential}} applications for electronic flash memories [1 – 3] and light emitters in visible [4] and near-infrared [5] wavelengths, making the indirect gap semiconductor attractive for novel electronic and optical devices. In comparison to bulk Ge, nanocrystals exhibit a tunable emission wavelength [6] and increased oscillator strength {{due to the}} quantum confinement of excitons. The confinement of charge carriers in these nanostructures allows one {{to increase the efficiency}} of the radiative recombination. The growth of Ge islands on Si substrates via Stranski-Krastanow growth mode has been extensively investigated as this opens up the possibility to <b>integrate</b> <b>optoelectronics</b> with planar Si technology. Most of the SiGe/Si structures are believed to exhibit a type-II heterointerface, where electrons and holes are spatially separated with a limited wave function overlap [7]. Owing to the type-II band alignment, Ge quantum dots (QDs) themselves form a potential well only for holes, whereas the electrons are weakly confined in their vicinities, i.e., by the tensile and compressive strain fields in the Si cap induced by the strained QDs [8]. This has led to the enhancement of PL quantum efficiency in planar Si/SiGe superlattices at elevated temperatures due to 3 D carrier localization within the Ge QDs and presumably due to large energy barriers formed at the heterointerfaces between the Ge clusters and the surrounding Si matrix [9].|$|R

40|$|Photonic antenna can {{be defined}} as {{intimate}} integration of optoelectronics with planar antenna to produce a highly multifunction module. Some works have been done to <b>integrate</b> <b>optoelectronics</b> with antenna. Among them, some focus on downlink side (photodiode integration with antenna) and some concentrate on uplink side (integration of laser diode with antenna). There are also some publications on bidirectional photonic antenna, which cover uplink and downlink. The bidirectional photonic antenna can be categorized into two groups, i. e. which use optoelectronics transceiver such as asymmetric Fabry-Perot modulator (AFPM) and separate photodetector and laser. AFPM is very specialized device, rarely available in the market, and its transceiver nature limit the flexibility of performance optimization for uplink and downlink. On other side, vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) and photodiode can be easily found in the market, lower cost, allowing independent optimization for uplink and downlink, and reliable. To the best of author’s knowledge, all publications on photonic antenna are measurement-based. This chapter uses simulation software to evaluate photonic antenna performance, to allow flexibility in design optimization, cost and time effective design process, and more complete evaluation parameter due to the use of optical communication system simulation.

Some examples of possible applications are laser beam scanning, switching and routing and active focusing, spectral filtering or shattering of optical sources. The two technologies use dissimilar materials with significant compatibility problems for a common process line. This project emphasized a hybrid approach to <b>integrating</b> <b>optoelectronics</b> and MEMS. Significant progress was made in developing processing capabilities for adding optical function to MEMS components, such as metal mirror coatings and through-vias in the substrate. These processes were used to demonstrate two integration examples, a MEMS discriminator driven by laser illuminated photovoltaic cells and a MEMS shutter or chopper. Another major difficulty with direct integration is providing the optical path for the MEMS components to interact with the light. The authors explored using folded optical paths in a transparent substrate to provide the interconnection route between the components of the system. The components can be surface-mounted by flip-chip bonding to the substrate. Micro-optics can be fabricated into the substrate to reflect and refocus the light so that it can propagate from one device to another and them be directed out of the substrate into free space.
