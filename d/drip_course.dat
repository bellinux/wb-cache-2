25|$|Annery limekiln has a ramp {{facing the}} river, three kilns (or burning 'pots'), seven {{entrance}} doorways and nine lower apertures {{for the removal}} of the calcined limestone. The arrangement of the kilns gives an L-shaped compact structure. Some of the entrances led to arched lobbies or 'eyes', at the back of which were the grates and separate 'poking holes' to insert metals rods for 'working' the charge and helping with aeration. A 'lean-to' slated roof may have slotted beneath part of the <b>drip</b> <b>course</b> of projecting stones, which runs around the exterior walls of the kiln. The arched entrances to the kiln allowed for the sheltered and safe collection of the quicklime, which reacted violently to water.|$|E
50|$|On the {{exterior}} {{there is often}} a corbeled brick crown, in which the projecting courses of brick act as a <b>drip</b> <b>course</b> to keep rainwater from running down {{the exterior}} walls. A cap, hood, or shroud serves to keep rainwater out of the exterior of the chimney; rain in the chimney is a much greater problem in chimneys lined with impervious flue tiles or metal liners than with the traditional masonry chimney, which soaks up all but the most violent rain. Some chimneys have a spark arrestor incorporated into the crown or cap.|$|E

5000|$|The {{exterior}} {{facade of}} the house is brick. The front facade is Flemish bond while the side and rear facades are common bond. The exterior bears a few restrained decorative details including a box cornice with dentil molding, the latter on the front facade only, windows set off with a simple architrave, and a belt or <b>drip</b> <b>course</b> on the west facade. The surrounds of {{the front door of the}} original section facing the main road and the side door of the ell addition facing the canal are of equal restraint, featuring entablatures with dentils, fluted pilasters, and paneled reveals and headers. The rear doors are surrounded by simple architrave trim. The front and rear doors of the original section are centered. The latter is diminutive, paneled, and glazed with one large pane. All 32 windows in the house have 1/1 sash. The bays of the front and side facades of the original section are equally spaced with upper level bays set directly above those below. This treatment is duplicated on the west wall of the ell addition with two bays on each story. The fenestration of the main section's rear facade was originally balanced, with three bays. It is partially obscured by the addition and displays a window on the first story with a second story window set directly above. Above the rear door is a diminutive window set at the staircase and to the left of the rear door is a circa 1920 small single pane window. The fenestration of the north and east walls of the addition is irregular. The north wall contains a single window which is set at the second story while the east wall contains one door on the first story with no bay above and one window on the first story with a window, not set directly above, on the second story. The doors on the west and east facades of the addition are both paneled and glazed with single panes. The original section features four fireplaces, two on each floor at gable ends, and has a full basement with a native stone foundation. Joists in the attic and basement are hand-cut. Roof rafters at the peak are held together with pegs. Contained in the full length center hall of this section is an open well, two flight staircase which features a simple newel post, mahogany handrail, plain balusters, and side panelling with applied molding. The hall is flanked by two parlors on the first floor and two bedrooms on the second. A powder room was erected on the first floor off the center hall circa 1920. The ell addition was erected over a crawl space, with notched and nailed roof rafters supporting a gable roof. The addition is composed of a bathroom and dressing room on the second floor and a kitchen on the first floor. The interior walls of both sections are of smoothly finished plaster and decorated with quirk beaded chair rails and baseboards. Ceilings on both the first and second floors are ten feet high. The trim of the fireplace in the east bedroom features colonettes, a convex frieze, bed-molding, and mantle shelf. Decorative painting has been uncovered on the frieze and trim of the fireplace in the west bedroom as well as on the window and door trim and baseboards of the room. The floors are of random width boards of long leaf yellow pine, some up to 18" [...] in width.|$|E
50|$|The Quaker Meeting House at Dolobran is an {{important}} monument {{in the history of}} the Quaker movement in the British Isles. It was built in 1701 by Charles Lloyd (1662-1747) of Dolobran, whose father Charles Lloyd (1637-1698) of Dolobran was the first in the family to become a Quaker. It consists of a tiny isolated chapel built of red-brick with <b>drip</b> <b>courses</b> over the cambered windows and comprising also a two-bay cottage under the same roof. The grade II* listed structure is an early example of brick building in Montgomeryshire. Today the Glyndŵr's Way long distance footpath passes nearby. Among the members of the Quaker meeting were the Lloyd family of Dolobran. Meetings ceased in 1828 but the building was restored by the Quakers in about 1970.|$|R
6000|$|The stately vessel stood high {{from the}} water, for Captain Jenness's cargo was light, {{and he was}} going out chiefly for a return freight. Sharp jibs and staysails cut their white {{outlines}} keenly against the afternoon blue of the summer heaven; the topsails and <b>courses</b> <b>dripped,</b> half-furled, from the yards stretching across the yellow masts that sprang so far aloft; the hull glistened black with new paint. When Lydia mounted to the deck she found it as clean scrubbed as her aunt's kitchen floor. Her glance of admiration was not lost upon Captain Jenness. [...] "Yes, Miss Blood," [...] said he, [...] "one difference between an American ship and any other sort is dirt. I wish I could take you aboard an English vessel, so you could appreciate the Aroostook. But I guess you don't need it," [...] he added, with a proud satisfaction in his laugh. [...] "The Aroostook ain't in order yet; wait till we've been a few days at sea." [...] The captain swept the deck with a loving eye. It was spacious and handsome, with a stretch of some forty or fifty feet between the house at the stern and the forecastle, which rose considerably higher; a low bulwark was surmounted by a heavy rail supported upon turned posts painted white. Everything, in spite of the captain's boastful detraction, was in perfect trim, at least to landfolk's eyes. [...] "Now come into the cabin," [...] said the captain. He gave Lydia's traps, as he called them, in charge of a boy, while he led the way below, by a narrow stairway, warning Lydia and her grandfather to look out for their heads as they followed. [...] "There!" [...] he said, when they had safely arrived, inviting their inspection of the place with a general glance of his own.|$|R
