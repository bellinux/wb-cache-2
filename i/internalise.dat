40|$|An {{international}} {{sample of}} 803 lesbians from 20 countries responded to an internet based questionnaire containing {{a measure of}} <b>internalised</b> homophobia expanded from the Lesbian <b>Internalised</b> Homophobia Scale of Szymanski and Chung (2001); a series of items that we hoped measured <b>internalised</b> misogyny; measures of homosexual identity, selfesteem, depression, and psychosexual adjustment. Exploratory factor analysis supported {{four of the five}} factors of <b>internalised</b> homophobia. The scale was reliable and valid in individual sub-samples from Australia, the United States, Canada, England, and Finland. Correlational data suggested that <b>internalised</b> homophobia and <b>internalised</b> misogyny were indeed distinct, though related constructs, and regression analyses suggested that, for this sample, <b>internalised</b> homophobia was a much better predictor of psychological and psychosexual adjustment than was <b>internalised</b> misogyny.

40|$|Psychiatric {{symptoms}} in childhood {{are closely related}} to neurocognitive deficits. However, it is unclear whether <b>internalising</b> and externalising symptoms are associated with general or distinct cognitive problems. We examined the relation between different types of psychiatric symptoms and neurocognitive functioning in a population-based sample of 1177 school-aged children. <b>Internalising</b> and externalising behaviour was studied both continuously and categorically. For continuous, variable-centred analyses, broadband scores of <b>internalising</b> and externalising symptoms were used. However, these measures are strongly correlated, which may prevent identification of distinct cognitive patterns. To distinguish groups of children with relatively homogeneous symptom patterns, a latent profile analysis of symptoms at age 6 yielded four exclusive groups of children: a class of children with predominantly <b>internalising</b> symptoms, a class with externalising symptoms, a class with co-occurring <b>internalising</b> and externalising symptoms, that resembles the CBCL dysregulation profile and a class with no problems. Five domains of neurocognitive ability were tested: attention/executive functioning, language, memory and learning, sensorimotor functioning, and visuospatial processing. Consistently, these two different modelling approaches demonstrated that children with <b>internalising</b> and externalising symptoms show distinct cognitive profiles. Children with more externalising symptoms performed lower in the attention/executive functioning domain, while children with more <b>internalising</b> symptoms showed impairment in verbal fluency and memory. In the most severely affected class of children with <b>internalising</b> and externalising symptoms, we found specific impairment in the sensorimotor domain. This study illustrates the specific interrelation of <b>internalising</b> and externalising symptoms and cognition in young children...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionComorbidity between problem {{gambling}} and <b>internalising</b> disorders (anxiety and depression) {{has long been}} recognised. However, {{it is not clear}} how these relationships develop, and what factors can foster resilience to both conditions. The current study draws on longitudinal cohort data to investigate: 1) the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between {{problem gambling}} and <b>internalising</b> symptoms; 2) whether there are common and/or specific social environmental factors protective against both <b>internalising</b> symptoms and problem gambling in young adulthood; and 3) interactive protective factors (i. e., those that moderate the relationship between problem gambling and <b>internalising</b> symptoms). MethodsA sample of 2248 young adults (55 % female) completed a survey in 2010 (T 1) and 2012 (T 2) which assessed problem gambling (measured via two items based on established measures), <b>internalising</b> symptoms, and social environmental protective factors. ResultsA positive cross-sectional relationship between problem gambling and <b>internalising</b> symptoms was found; however, there was no statistically significant longitudinal relationship between the two conditions. Protective factors for <b>internalising</b> symptoms were observed within the domains of the community, family and peer group; however, there were no statistically significant protective factors identified for problem gambling. ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that the social environmental protective factors for adult <b>internalising</b> symptoms assessed in the present study are poor longitudinal predictors of young adult problem gambling. Given the lack of common protective factors, it may be necessary to focus on separate factors to protect against each condition, if we are to address the comorbidity between problem gambling and <b>internalising</b> symptoms...|$|R

500|$|Locke dedicates {{the bulk}} of Some Thoughts Concerning Education to {{explaining}} how to instill virtue in children. He defines virtue as a combination of self-denial and rationality: [...] "that a man is able to deny himself his own desires, cross his own inclinations, and purely follow what reason directs as best, though the appetite lean the other way" [...] (Locke's emphasis). Future virtuous adults must be able not only to practice self-denial but also to see the rational path. Locke was convinced that children could reason early in life and that parents should address them as reasoning beings. Moreover, he argues that parents should, above all, {{attempt to create a}} [...] "habit" [...] of thinking rationally in their children. Locke continually emphasises habit over rule—children should <b>internalise</b> the habit of reasoning rather than memorise a complex set of prohibitions. This focus on rationality and habit corresponds to two of Locke's concerns in the Essay Concerning Human Understanding. Throughout the Essay, Locke bemoans the irrationality of the majority and their inability, because of the authority of custom, to change or forfeit long-held beliefs. His attempt to solve this problem is not only to treat children as rational beings but also to create a disciplinary system founded on esteem and disgrace rather than on rewards and punishments. For Locke, rewards such as sweets and punishments such as beatings turn children into sensualists rather than rationalists; such sensations arouse passions rather than reason. He argues that [...] "such a sort of slavish discipline makes a slavish temper" [...] (Locke's emphasis).|$|E

2500|$|Pollution of {{breathable}} air is {{a central}} problem {{in the management of}} the global commons. Pollutants can be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and may be natural or man-made. [...] Although controversial and limited in scope by methods of enforcement, in several parts of the world the polluter pays principle, which makes the party responsible for producing pollution responsible for paying for the damage done to the natural environment, is accepted. It has strong support in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Community (EC) countries. It is also known as extended producer responsibility (EPR). [...] EPR seeks to shift the responsibility dealing with waste from governments (and thus, taxpayers and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it attempts to <b>internalise</b> the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically resulting in producers improving the waste profile of their products, decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for reuse and recycling.|$|E
2500|$|Redundancies are {{a special}} kind of dismissal, which attract {{specific}} regulation. Since the Redundancy Payments Act 1965, staff must receive a payment for losing their jobs if the employer no longer has an economic need for their job. This policy is designed to <b>internalise</b> some of the social costs that employers create if they dismiss staff, to try and disincentivise unnecessary job losses, and contribute to employees' costs in unemployment. Under ERA 1996 section 162, employees over age 40 receive 1½ weeks' pay per year they had worked, employees aged 22 to 40 receive 1 week's pay per year worked, and employees age 21 or less receive half a week's pay, though the upper limit was £464 per week in 2014. Dismissal for redundancy counts [...] "fair" [...] in substance under ERA 1996 section 98, but the employer may still carry out an unfair procedure to dismiss the redundant employees. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 139, a [...] "redundancy" [...] exists when an employer's demand for an employee's role ceases or diminishes. In situations where employees have lost their jobs, this may be straightforward. In cases where an employer uses its discretion practically to worsen the employees' position the answer may depend on the employees' contracts. In Lesney Products & Co v Nolan a toy company stopped giving its workers overtime. Some refused to work. They were dismissed, and the workers claimed they were redundant. Lord Denning MR held they were not made [...] "redundant" [...] by their terms being changed, even worsened, because [...] "nothing should be done to impair the ability of employers to reorganise their work force and their times and conditions of work so as to improve efficiency." [...] Apparently, they had simply left stopped working of their own accord. This view is controversial, because if the total wage bill spent by the employer is reduced, it would follow that demand for work (reflected in the employer's willingness to pay) must also be diminished. Thus, other courts have suggested the contract terms are irrelevant, and that the test should be purely based on the economic reality of diminished demand. Employers can also argue that a dismissal is for [...] "some other substantial reason". In Hollister v National Farmers’ Union a farmer's refusal to accept decreased pension entitlements, after a consultation process, was said to be a [...] "substantial" [...] reason for dismissal. It is not clear whether worsening employees' contract terms, without their consent or collective approval, was envisaged by the Act as way to evade redundancy payments.|$|E

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used. Studies were identified through electronic databases, grey literature, reference harvesting and contacts with key researchers. Quality of findings was assessed through an adapted version of the Cambridge Quality Checklists. A total of 590 potentially relevant titles were identified. Seventeen peer-reviewed articles and one draft book chapter were included. Studies investigated socio-demographic, HIV-related, intra-personal and interpersonal correlates of <b>internalised</b> stigma. Eleven articles used cross-sectional data, six articles used prospective cohort data and one used both prospective cohort and cross-sectional data to assess correlates of <b>internalised</b> stigma. Poor HIV-related health weakly predicted increases in <b>internalised</b> HIV stigma in three longitudinal studies. Lower depression scores and improvements in overall mental health predicted reductions in <b>internalised</b> HIV stigma in two longitudinal studies, with moderate and weak effects, respectively. No other consistent predictors were found. Studies utilising analysis of change and accounting for confounding factors are necessary to guide policy and programming but are scarce. High-risk populations, other stigma markers that might layer upon <b>internalised</b> stigma, and structural drivers of <b>internalised</b> stigma need to be examined...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: One {{possible}} risk {{marker of}} later <b>internalising</b> symptoms is poor sleep, {{which is a}} problem for up to 40 % of children. The present study investigated whether prior sleep problems could predict <b>internalising</b> symptoms over a period of 18 years of follow-up. METHODS: The study sample included 1503 French young adults from the TEMPO cohort (mean age= 28. 8 ± 3. 6 years) whose parents participate in the GAZEL cohort study. All TEMPO participants previously took part in a study of children's mental health and behaviour in 1991 (mean age= 10. 3 ± 3. 6 years) and 1999 (mean age= 18. 8 ± 3. 6 years). Sleep problems and <b>internalising</b> symptoms (depression, anxiety, somatic complaints) were assessed three times (1991, 1999, 2009) using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) questionnaire. The association between sleep problems in 1991 and trajectories of <b>internalising</b> problems from 1991 to 2009 was tested in a multinomial logistic regression framework, controlling for sex, age, baseline temperament, behavioural problems and stressful life events, as well as family income, and parental history of depression. RESULTS: We identified four trajectories of <b>internalising</b> symptoms: high-persistent (2. 5 %), high-decreasing (11. 4 %), low-increasing (11. 6 %), and low-persistent (74. 5 %). After controlling for covariates, compared to participants who did not have sleep problems in 1991, those who did were 4. 51 times (95 % CI= 1. 54 - 13. 19, P=. 006) more likely to have high-persistent <b>internalising</b> symptoms and 3. 69 times (95 % CI= 2. 00 - 6. 82, P<. 001) more likely to have high-decreasing <b>internalising</b> symptoms over the 18 -year follow-up. LIMITATIONS: Sleep problems and <b>internalising</b> symptoms were based on self-report questions, results should be interpreted with due caution.

40|$|The Lesbian Internalized Homophobia Scale (LIHS, Szymanski & Chung, 2001) was {{developed}} to assess internalized homophobia in lesbians. Support for {{the psychometric properties of}} the scale have been found in studies with samples from the United States. The current study assessed the psychometric properties of the LIHS in a cross-cultural sample of 803 lesbians from 20 countries (MAge = 34. 77 years, SD = 11. 61) recruited via advertisements placed in e-groups, e-bulletin boards, and women’s press. Cross-cultural comparisons were examined on reported levels of <b>internalised</b> homophobia, and the psychosocial correlates of <b>internalised</b> misogyny, depression, self-esteem, psychosexual adjustment and homosexual identity formation. The current study also reports the development and psychometric properties of a new scale that measures <b>internalised</b> misogyny. It was hypothesised that the reliability of the LIHS and levels of <b>internalised</b> homophobia would differ by country as a result of variations in cultural manifestations of homophobia. Factorial analysis of the LIHS provided support for four of the five LIHS sub-scales. This shorter version of the LIHS demonstrated good reliability and validity in a multi-cultural sample and individually in samples from Australia, the United States, Canada, England and Finland. Cross-cultural comparison on levels of <b>internalised</b> homophobia demonstrated significant differences between countries with lesbians in Australia reporting the lowest levels and lesbians from England the highest. The results of this study have furthered the understanding of <b>internalised</b> homophobia and have provided empirical support for the theoretical proposition that a relationship exists between <b>internalised</b> misogyny and <b>internalised</b> homophobia.

We conducted a single-blind randomised controlled pilot trial comparing CT plus treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU only.

CT incorporated up to 12 sessions over 4 months (mean sessions= 9. 3). Primary outcome was the <b>Internalised</b> Stigma of Mental Illness Scale – Revised (ISMI-R) total score, which provides a continuous measure of <b>internalised</b> stigma associated with mental health problems. Secondary outcomes included self-rated recovery, <b>internalised</b> shame, emotional problems, hopelessness and self-esteem. Recruitment rates and retention for this trial were good. Changes in outcomes were analysed following the intention-to-treat principle, using ANCOVAs adjusted for baseline symptoms. There was no effect on our primary outcome, with a sizable reduction observed in both groups, but several secondary outcomes were significantly improved in the group assigned to CT, in comparison with TAU, including <b>internalised</b> shame, hopelessness and self-rated recovery.

Four psychotherapists, who self-identified as white, participated in semi-structured interviews, exploring their perceptions and understandings of how <b>internalised</b> racism and racism manifested within the clinical setting. The data from these interviews was analysed using thematic analysis and produced four main themes; ‘manifestations of <b>internalised</b> racism and racism in therapy’, ‘dis-identification’, ‘therapist’s explicitness’ and ‘connection to culture’. These themes were supported and anchored by four sub-themes. The themes represent a therapeutic process called: emergence, understanding, intervention and aim. The emergence of ‘racism and <b>internalised</b> racism in therapy’ describes both the clients’ and the psychotherapists’ experiences of <b>internalised</b> racism and racism as it emerges in the therapeutic encounter. ‘Dis-identification’ captures the psychotherapists’ understanding of <b>internalised</b> racism operating as their minority client’s dis-identification with their {{racial and cultural}} heritage. ‘Therapist’s explicitness’ identifies a therapeutic intervention, the psychotherapist’s communication to their minority clients about the racial differences between them. And finally ‘connection to culture’ captures the psychotherapist’s therapeutic aim of encouraging a connection to racial and cultural heritage as a protective factor against racism and emotional and psychological difficulties...|$|R

The sample included 107 (pre) -adolescents in the ages of 11 to 18 years old who had a diagnostic examination at a psychological practice and (one of) their parents, living in the Netherlands. Each child completed self report questionnaires on coping strategies, self-esteem and experienced social acceptance. Each parent completed a questionnair on the <b>internalising</b> problems of their child. Results showed that the passive coping strategy positively predicts total <b>internalising</b> problems, anxious/ depressive and withdrawn/ depressive problems and negatively predicts self-esteem. The coping strategy expression of emotions negatively predicts total <b>internalising</b> problems and withdrawn/ depressive problems. The avoidant strategy negatively predicts experienced social acceptance and finally the strategy positive self instruction positively predicts self-esteem. Girls have more <b>internalising</b> problems than boys, regardless the coping strategy they use. Girls also tend to use more of the strategy expression of emotions and the passive strategy than boys. There were no gender and age differences in the relation between coping strategies and <b>internalising</b> problems.

The fundamental concepts of the research are race, <b>internalised</b> racism, racial identity, professional identity and the dynamic of racial identity and professional identity in therapy. Autoethnography is the methodological approach that is used to comprehend experiences of <b>internalised</b> racism and professional identity. The autoethnographic approach is used in multiple ways through a layered account that moves back and forth in time, and inward and outward between self and culture, demonstrating how early encounters with racism during childhood in Thailand interact with the experience of starting therapeutic practice with white clients in Scotland. The goal is to facilitate readers’ understanding of, and empathy with, the experiences of a therapist of colour who has <b>internalised</b> racism.

The thesis demonstrates that <b>internalised</b> racism influences a therapist of colour to perform whiteness, collude with white clients in denial of racial difference, avoid challenging racial issues in sessions, require white clients’ reassurance to prove the therapist’s competence, and try to disprove white clients’ prejudgements about the therapist due to the therapist’s race...|$|R
