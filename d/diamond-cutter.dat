Buckingham and Gerbier between them guided the work. Soon it was accomplished, and a vessel slipped down the Thames, allowed to pass by those who kept close watch to enforce the royal decree, and made sail for Calais, which was beginning to manifest surprise at this entire cessation of traffic from England. From that vessel landed Gerbier, and rode straight to Paris, carrying the Queen of France the duplicate studs, which were to replace those which she had sent to Buckingham.|$|E

The skipper fulfilled his promise by taking Cyril to the house of one of the men with whom he did business, and arranging with him to board the boy until word came that he could safely return to England. The man was a <b>diamond-cutter,</b> and to him packets of jewellery and gems that could not be disposed of in England had often been brought over by the captain. The latter {{had nothing to do with}} the pecuniary arrangements, which were made direct by Marner, and he had only to hand over the packets and take back sums of money to England.|$|E

Moreover, he had sent to several jewelers and mineralogists some of the smaller fragments which he had picked up in the cave of light, and these specialists, while reporting the material of the specimens purest diamond, expressed the greatest surprise at their shape and brilliancy. They had evidently not been ground or cut, and yet their sharp points and glittering surfaces reflected light {{as if they had been}} in the hands of a <b>diamond-cutter.</b> One of these experts wrote to Clewe asking him if he had been digging diamonds with a machine which broke the gems to pieces.|$|E

Her 1880s shop sign is still emblazoned across the frontage and Safia and Ian Thomas have kept the name and painstakingly restored the historic building. As a result, A. Gold is handsome and old-fashioned looking, while keeping the modern efficiencies of a deli.|$|R
60|$|Well--but it is answered, {{are we to}} have no diamonds, nor china, nor pictures, nor footmen, then--but all to be farmers? I am {{not saying}} {{what we ought to}} do, I want only to show you with perfect {{clearness}} first what we are doing; and that, I repeat, is the upshot of machine-contriving in this country. And observe its effect on the national strength. Without machines, you have a hundred and fifty yeomen ready to join for defence of the land. You get your machine, starve fifty of them, make <b>diamond-cutters</b> or footmen of as many more, and for your national defence against an enemy, you have now, and can have, only fifty men, instead of a hundred and fifty; these also now with minds much alienated from you as their chief,[141] and the rest, lapidaries or footmen; and a steam plough.|$|R

The sealed instructions, as I think, explain {{how it was}} that he died, after all, quietly in his bed. In the event of his death by violence (that is to say, {{in the absence of the}} regular letter from him at the appointed date), my father was then directed to send the Moonstone secretly to Amsterdam. It was to be deposited in that city with a famous <b>diamond-cutter,</b> and it was to be cut up into from four to six separate stones. The stones were then to be sold for what they would fetch, and the proceeds were to be applied to the founding of that professorship of experimental chemistry, which the Colonel has since endowed by his Will. Now, Betteredge, exert those sharp wits of yours, and observe the conclusion to which the Colonel's instructions point!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Tillemans {{was born}} in Antwerp in [...] 1684, {{the son of a}} <b>diamond-cutter,</b> and studied {{painting}} there under various masters. As he was the brother-in-law of another Flemish painter, Pieter Casteels, it is assumed that he married before leaving Antwerp. Like other artists from the Low Countries such as Dirk Maas, Jan Wyck and Willem van de Velde the Younger, Tillemans moved to England. In Tillemans's case he moved in 1708, induced to do so by a picture-dealer called Turner: he spent {{the rest of his life}} working there.|$|E

In addition to keeping all 613 Mitzvot, he is waiting for his intended, or basherte, the daughter of a Paris rebbe whom he has not yet actually met. They are the subjects of an arranged marriage, but he believes that she is his soul mate, chosen by God. He is also studying the Kabbalah, which is regarded as rather daring for a man under 40. Its discussion of sexual intimacy is restrained but specific, as well {{as a metaphor for the}} relationship between Man and God.|$|E

He married in 1651 and again in 1656, when he {{described}} himself as a [...] "painter", but he is described as a [...] "shopkeeper" [...] in 1663 and 1665, when he was made bankrupt. He had been a [...] "winkelier" [...] or haberdasher-draper, [...] "selling caps, bonnets and stockings". [...] This was presumably an unsuccessful attempt to escape from the highly competitive Amsterdam art world. [...] His earliest dated work is a drawing from 1641, with a dated painting from 1643. [...] His marine style was initially based on that of Jan Porcellis, then that of Simon de Vlieger in whose studio he worked c. 1650-3, bringing him into contact with Jan van de Cappelle.|$|E

40|$|Micro-hardness and scratch {{adhesion}} testing are {{the most}} commonly used techniques for assessing the mechanical properties of thin films. Both of these testing methods utilize single-point contact and induce plastic deformation in the substrate and film. However, the influence of adhesion on the measured hardness has been seldom reported so far. In our experiments, diamond-like carbon (DLC) and silicon carbide (SiC) films deposited on silicon and nickel-based alloy substrates by pulsed laser ablation were indented and scratched by a Vickers micro-hardness tester and a <b>diamond-cutter,</b> respectively. It was found that the composite hardness decreased more rapidly for poor adhesion when increasing the indentation load. The result was explained by the elastic-plastic deformation mode of indentation and helped us to understand the physical meaning of one parameter commonly introduced in the models used to separate film hardness from the composite hardness...|$|E
