5000|$|Injection (often {{referred}} to as a [...] "shot" [...] in US English, or a [...] "jab" [...] in UK English) is the act of putting a liquid, especially a drug, into a person's body using a needle (usually a hypodermic needle) and a syringe. Injection is a technique for delivering drugs by parenteral administration, that is, administration via a route other than through the digestive tract. Parenteral injection includes subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracardiac, intraarticular and <b>intracavernous</b> <b>injection.</b>|$|E
50|$|Combined <b>intracavernous</b> <b>injection</b> and {{stimulation}} test or CIS test is {{the most}} commonly performed office diagnostic procedure for erectile dysfunction. It consists of an intracavernosal injection, visual or manual sexual stimulation, and a rating of the subsequent erection. Neurogenic and hormonal influences are thus bypassed as {{the status of the}} blood vessels of the penis is assessed directly and objectively. A rigid erection of more than 10 minutes indicates normal function of veins. The same conclusion cannot be made for the function of arteries as some men with mild arterial problems can also have the same response.|$|E
50|$|An intracavernous (or intracavernosal, intradicular) {{injection}} is {{an injection}} {{into the base}} of the penis. This injection site is often used to administer medications to check for or treat erectile dysfunction in adult men (in e.g. combined <b>intracavernous</b> <b>injection</b> and stimulation test). The more common medications administered in this manner include Caverject, Trimix (prostaglandin, papaverine, and phentolamine), Bimix (papaverine and phentolamine), and Quadmix (prostaglandin, papaverine, phentolamine, and either atropine or forskolin). These medications are all types of vasodilators and cause tumescence within 10-15 minutes.Common side effects include, but are not limited to, priapism, bruising, fibrosis, Peyronies, and pain.|$|E

40|$|Erectile {{dysfunction}} (ED) {{is observed}} {{in up to}} 81 % of men with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and therefore should be counselled as a common complaint in this disorder. Whereas ED is frequently associated with atherosclerosis {{in the general population}} in which it is also a harbinger of cardiovascular events, ED has a different aetiology in SSc. In SSc the penile blood flow is impaired due to both myointimal proliferation of small arteries and corporal fibrosis. Data on the prevention of ED in SSc are not available. On-demand phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE- 5) inhibitors are not effective in improving erectile function, but fixed daily or alternate day regimens of long acting PDE- 5 inhibitors provide a measurable, although often limited, clinical benefit.

5000|$|The papavérine <b>intracavernous</b> <b>injection</b> was {{a turning}} point in the history of the {{treatment}} of erectile dysfunction. It has been, from everyone’s opinion, a decisive progress in the approach and the treatment of an illness affecting millions of men. Active member, in one of the most renowned unit of cardiovascular surgery in Europe, Ronald Virag already developed an intervention aiming at improving the blood flow in the penis. His intervention called “dorsal vein arterialization” is known in the United States as the “Virag’s procedure”. In 1981, during a surgical procedure on the penis, he discovered that an old medication extracted from poppies, and used since the late 19th century to dilate blood vessels, could induce an erection when injected into the penis. After a year of observing the effects of papaverine on volunteers, among which himself, the discovery is being published in the famous medical journal “Lancet”. From then on nothing will ever be the same again, neither in the treatment, as quite rapidly a thousand of patients will benefit from it, or in research as the <b>intracavernous</b> <b>injection</b> will now be the reference and the means of triggering the erection when needed to be studied. Since then, the technique was improved, for the comfort of the patients who may now use an automatic injector. Today, “more than ten years after the Viagra© outbreak, the intracavernous mini injection remains the most efficient and reliable medical treatment for erectile dysfunction.” ...|$|E

He was received as intern, subsequently as resident in Parisian Assistance Publique Hospitals. Afterwards, he is appointed Chief Resident at the Faculty and specializes in cardiovascular surgery. He creates several cardiovascular surgery units in private institutions before taking an interest in male sexual dysfunction caused by vascular diseases. He develops specific techniques to explore penile hemodynamics and designs various original surgical interventions, such as the penis dorsal vein arterialization which is named after him. In 1982, he discovers, almost by chance that an old medication, papaverine injected directly into the penis is able to provoke a long lasting erection Thus, he develops the technique of <b>intracavernous</b> <b>injection</b> used worldwide since 1983 to treat erectile dysfunction.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of data {{accumulated}} thus far, {{it is reasonable to}} discuss the implementation of a “penile rehabilitation” program with patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Central to discussions of penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy is evidence demonstrating significant fibrotic changes in the corpus cavernosum that occur postoperatively. Several studies have been published evaluating the efficacy of various pro-erectogenic agents. The limited data regarding <b>intracavernous</b> <b>injections</b> and vacuum constriction devices suggest that an increased percentage of treated patients experienced a return of natural erections compared with patients who received no treatment. Longer, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies will be needed to confirm the utility of these treatments. Data from contemporary studies evaluating the chronic use of oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors suggest a beneficial effect on endothelial cell function among men suffering from erectile dysfunction due to a variety of causes.

40|$|AbstractSexual {{dysfunction}} (SD) is {{a common}} feature of men with multiple sclerosis. SD is often unrecognized as patients and physicians are reluctant to discuss these problems. Rates of symptoms range from 50 % to 90 % and include erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, orgasmic dysfunction and reduced libido. SD can arise at any stage of the disease, even without severe disability. While erectile dysfunction {{is thought to be}} related to impairment of the pathways in the spinal cord, fatigue, spasticity, bladder and bowel dysfunction, and pain, contribute to SD. Psychosocial and cultural issues also need evaluating, and include depression, performance anxiety, lowered self-esteem. A comprehensive assessment of all theses aspects must be taken into account. Erectile dysfunction can be treated with phosphodiesterase inhibitors and <b>intracavernous</b> <b>injections,</b> with good efficacy. Ejaculatory dysfunction is managed through penile vibratory stimulation and midodrine.

The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) can ameliorate cavernous nerve injury-induced erectile dysfunction (CNIED) rats and to determine its mechanism. Twenty-eight days after <b>intracavernous</b> <b>injection</b> of 5 -ethynyl- 2 -deoxyuridine- (EdU-) labeled ADSCs, the erectile function of all the rats was evaluated by intracavernosal pressure (ICP). The ADSCs steadily secreted detectable pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in vitro. The expression of PEDF increased in the penis of the bilateral cavernous nerve injury (BCNI) group for 14 days and then gradually decreased.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Penile {{prosthesis}} {{has become}} one of the most accepted treatment options in patients who do not respond to conservative medical therapies (oral or <b>intracavernous</b> <b>injections).</b> When penile fibrosis is present, this surgery becomes a real surgical challenge even for a skillful surgeon. AIM: The aim of this study was to review latest techniques to implant a penile prosthesis in patients with corporal fibrosis. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, SCOPUS, and Science Citation Index without any date limits for the terms: "penile prosthesis,"penile fibrosis,"impotence,"fibrosis,"cavernotomes,"downsized prosthesis cylinders,"patient satisfaction,"penile graft," and "vascular graft. " MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We reported in each technique and series data regarding penile size, complication rate, infection rate, technical pitfalls and details, use of additional surgical tools or implanted material (grafts, etc.), patients' satisfaction, and overall success rate. RESULTS: When penile corporal fibrosis is present, this surgery becomes a real surgical challenge even for a skillful surgeon. Over the years, multiple surgical approaches have been suggested to facilitate implantation in this difficult situation. Traditional approaches include the resection of scar tissue, performing extensive corporotomies and the eventually use of grafts to cover the corporal gap. Outcomes can be improved combining the use of techniques for scar incision (extensive wide excision, multiple incisions minimizing excision, corporal counter incisions, corporal excavation technique or Shaeer's technique) and cavernotomes and downsized prosthesis. Surgical strategies like upsizing prosthesis, suspensory ligament release or scrotoplasty must be kept in mind to utilize in this special scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Penile prosthesis in a patient with severe corporal fibrosis remains a surgical challenge. There are several techniques and surgical strategies that an implant surgeon should know and manage to minimize complications and improve outcomes...|$|R

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a population of circulating cells with endothelial-regenerative potential that may be reduced in ED and coronary patients. Recently, increased levels of osteocalcin (OCN) -positive EPC have been reported in coronary patients. AIM: Investigate the correlation between OCN-positive EPC and cavernous atherosclerotic lesion in ED patients. METHODS: A total of 35 subjects (20 ED patients and 15 controls) were evaluated in our andrological center and enrolled in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All subjects underwent routine clinical examination. Patients were also evaluated with high resolution echo color doppler of penile districts (intima media thickness [IMT] before and after <b>intracavernous</b> alprostadil <b>injection)</b> and circulating levels of progenitor cells (PC), EPC, and OCN-positive fraction of EPC. RESULTS: A progressive reduction of circulating EPC with the severity of cavernous artery atherosclerosis was found.

40|$|Intracavernous {{papaverine}} injection may be {{the first}} diagnostic step in the assessment of the impotent patient. However, the appreciation of its effect must rely on the evaluation of penile rigidity. Since measurement of rigidity requires a sophisticated procedure that may not be available to the majority of practitioners, we attempted to find a simple and objective method to evaluate the results of this common test. We tested 50 patients complaining of impotence with <b>intracavernous</b> <b>injection</b> of 60 mg. papaverine. The length and circumference of the penis were measured before and after papaverine injection. The rigidity was determined by measuring the angle between the penis and the legs with the patient in the standing position. Afterwards, each patient underwent vascular (Doppler ultrasound and cavernometry) and neurological examinations. A total of 27 patients with no vascular abnormalities had an erectile angle of 96 degrees (range 90 to 130 degrees), while 23 patients had some vascular disorders (9 arterial lesions, 8 venous leakage and 6 combined lesions) and an erectile angle of 36 degrees (range 0 to 60 degrees). There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups in the increase of length and circumference of the penis after <b>intracavernous</b> <b>injection</b> of papaverine. The papaverine test can distinguish between patients with vascular and psychogenic problems.

40|$|Stem cell (SC) {{therapy for}} erectile {{dysfunction}} (ED) {{has been investigated}} in 35 published studies, with one being a small-scale clinical trial. Out of these 35 studies, 19 are concerned with cavernous nerve (CN) injury-associated ED while 10 with diabetes mellitus- (DM-) associated ED. Adipose-derived SCs (ADSCs) were employed in 18 studies while bone marrow SCs (BMSCs) in 9. Transplantation of SCs was done mostly by <b>intracavernous</b> (IC) <b>injection,</b> as seen in 25 studies. Allogeneic and xenogeneic transplantations have increasingly been performed but their immune-incompatibility issues were rarely discussed. More recent studies also tend to use combinatory therapies by modifying or supplementing SCs with angiogenic or neurotrophic genes or proteins. All studies reported better erectile function with SC transplantation, and the majority also reported improved muscle, endothelium, and/or nerve in the erectile tissue. However, differentiation or engraftment of transplanted SCs has rarely been observed; thus, paracrine action is generally believed {{to be responsible for}} SC’s therapeutic effects.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{therapeutic}} effects of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) -based microtissues (MTs) on erectile dysfunction (ED) in streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats. Fifty-six 8 -week-old Sprague-Dawley rats received intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg kg− 1), and 8 weeks later, the determined diabetic rats randomly received <b>intracavernous</b> (IC) <b>injection</b> of phosphate buffer solution (PBS), ADSCs, or MTs. Another eight normal rats equally got IC injection of PBS. MTs were generated with a hanging drop method, and the injected cells were tracked in ADSC- and MT-injected rats. Four weeks after the treatments, intracavernous pressure (ICP), histopathological changes in corpus cavernosum (CC), and functional proteins were measured. Rat cytokine antibody array was used to detect ADSCs or MTs lysate. The results showed that MTs expressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene- 6 (TSG- 6). MTs injection had a higher retention than ADSCs injection and MTs treatment improved ICP, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression, smooth muscle, and endothelial contents in diabetic rats, ameliorated local inflammation in CC better. Thus, our findings demonstrate that IC injection of MTs improves erectile function and histopathological changes in STZ-induced diabetic rats {{and appears to be}} more promising than traditional ADSCs.

40|$|Purpose: We {{investigated}} {{whether a}} relationship {{exists between the}} flow to maintain an erection obtained at cavernosometry and the alteration of intracavernous structures in impotent patients with corporeal veno-occlusive dysfunction and normal arterial inflow. Materials and Methods: Computerized histomorphometric analysis of smooth muscle and elastic fibers, and endothelial cells was compared to the flow necessary to maintain erection after <b>intracavernous</b> vasoactive drug <b>injection</b> in 18 patients with corporeal veno-occlusive dysfunction. Results: A significant correlation between percentage of smooth muscle fibers and flow to maintain erection was observed, while no correlation was noted with elastic fibers and endothelial cells. Conclusions: Corporeal veno-occlusive dysfunction seems to be due mainly to smooth muscular alterations. According to this observation treatment of impotent patients with this abnormality should not be restricted to the penile veins but should also include the intracavernous structures, predominantly the muscular component.
