The complaint alleged {{that some of the}} funds were used to pay restitution ordered in his dogfighting case.|$|E
5|$|The palace, like Windsor Castle, {{is owned}} by the reigning monarch in right of the Crown. It is not the monarch's {{personal}} property, unlike Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle. Many of the contents from Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Kensington Palace, and StJames's Palace are part of the Royal Collection, <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>trust</b> by the Sovereign; they can, on occasion, be viewed by the public at the Queen's Gallery, near the Royal Mews. Unlike the palace and the castle, the purpose-built gallery is open continually and displays a changing selection of items from the collection. It occupies the site of the chapel destroyed by an air raid in World WarII. The palace's state rooms have been open to the public during August and September and on selected dates throughout the year since 1993.

In the year to 31 March 2016, 519,000 people visited the palace, and 194,000 visited the gallery.|$|E
