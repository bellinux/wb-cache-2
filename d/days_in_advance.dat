5|$|Although {{the filmmakers}} put {{considerable}} effort into historical accuracy, particularly in details, {{the film is}} known for some key distortions of history. An entirely fictional sequence was added in which Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack; anti-aircraft shells are shown bursting around the Enola Gay on its bombing run over Hiroshima; and {{it is said that}} leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima for ten <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> of the mission warning the citizens of the forthcoming raid. The film received generally mixed reviews, and was a box office disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Each {{participating}} country, {{other than}} the host country, may submit suggested problems to a Problem Selection Committee provided by the host country, which reduces the submitted problems to a shortlist. The team leaders arrive at the IMO a few <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> of the contestants and form the IMO Jury {{which is responsible for}} all the formal decisions relating to the contest, starting with selecting the six problems from the shortlist. The Jury aims to order the problems so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6. As the leaders know the problems in advance of the contestants, they are kept strictly separated and observed.|$|E

5|$|News {{stations}} were stationed with crews along the Jersey shore several <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> of Isabel to provide breaking news and live conditions. Many residents prepared their houses by boarding windows and purchasing emergency supplies. The Sussex County {{chapter of the}} American Red Cross advised local high schools to be on stand-by as potential shelters in the event evacuation occurred. Emergency coordinators in several counties were on alert, though none issued evacuations. In preparation for anticipated power outages, the Jersey Central Power and Light company arranged to receive more electrical crews from its parent company, FirstEnergy. Other utility workers from various locations as far as Canada left for {{the state in the}} event of power outages.|$|E
5|$|Surjik {{personally}} {{asked if}} he could direct the episode because he was a fan of the series; this was his only credit for the series. Filming the episode was difficult for the cast and crew due largely {{to the fact that the}} script arrived for the cast and crew to film only two <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance.</b> Other issues arose because of technical reasons; one scene required flooding a hallway with 3,300 gallons of water. Many of the scenes were filmed at Riverview Hospital, a mental health facility located in Coquitlam, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather more than a few <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E

5|$|Virginia {{has some}} special {{considerations}} that affect tropical cyclone-related rainfall. Mountains {{to the west}} act as a perfect mechanism for upward motion during sustained east winds, {{which can lead to}} flash flooding and landslides in that region (e.g. Hurricane Camille). As a tropical system approaches from the south, a frontal zone sets up between the moist Atlantic Ocean and the drier landmass to the west. This boundary can set up two or three <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> of a tropical storm, and can lead up to prolonged heavy rains across coastal sections (e.g. Hurricane Floyd). As the cyclone advances north, the boundary will slowly shift west, but progresses west of a Richmond/Washington, D.C. line.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City manager Joe Mercer {{named his}} {{team for the}} final several <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance.</b> Glyn Pardoe missed {{training}} on Monday 21st with a leg injury, but after the fitness of Pardoe, Tony Coleman and Alan Oakes was tested in a practice match, all three were passed fit. Leicester City named a 14-man squad before travelling to a training camp in Bisham on the Tuesday. Manchester City travelled south on the Thursday, staying in Weybridge. Leicester had fitness doubts over Dave Gibson, Len Glover and John Sjoberg, but initially expected all three to be available for the final. However, in a practice match against Brentford, Sjoberg {{had to leave the}} field with a groin injury. His place in the team was taken by Alan Woollett.|$|E

5|$|By 4 {{days before}} Isabel made landfall, most {{computer}} models predicted Isabel {{to make landfall}} between North Carolina and New Jersey, and the National Hurricane Center consistently forecast a landfall on North Carolina. Initially, forecasters predicted a landfall in the northeastern portion of the state, though as the hurricane neared land the predicted landfall position was much closer to where it ultimately was. From three <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average track error was 18miles (29km). Strong confidence in Isabel's final landfall prompted the National Hurricane Center to issue a hurricane watch for the entire North Carolina coastline about 50hours before Isabel struck land. 38hours before the hurricane made landfall, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the landfall area. The Newport Weather Forecast Office issued a flood potential statement two days before landfall, which indicated a threat for flash flooding. The office began preparing for the hurricane one week before landfall, and brought additional staff members to assist with hurricane related duties.|$|E
