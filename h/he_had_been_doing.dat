Bowie had insisted on the cropped black-and-white image as he felt that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial; when Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used.

5|$|Ament and Gossard were {{devastated by}} the death of Wood and the {{resulting}} demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Hornung left Eton College in 1914, {{intending}} to enter King's College, Cambridge later that year. When Britain entered {{the war against}} Germany, he volunteered, and was commissioned into the Essex Regiment. He was killed at the Second Battle of Ypres on 6 July 1915, aged 20. Although heartbroken by the loss, Hornung was adamant that some good would come of it and he edited a privately issued collection of Oscar's letters home under the title Trusty and Well Beloved, released in 1916. Around this time he joined an anti-aircraft unit. In either 1916 or 1917 he joined the YMCA and did volunteer work in England for soldiers on leave; in March 1917 he visited France, writing a poem about his experience afterwards—something <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> more frequently since Oscar's death—and a collection of his war poetry, Ballad of Ensign Joy, was published later that year.|$|E

500|$|... "Yeah 3x" [...] (pronounced [...] "Yeah three times" [...] or [...] "Yeah Yeah Yeah"; {{sometimes}} stylized as [...] "Yeah 3X") {{is a song}} by American {{recording artist}} Chris Brown, released as the lead single from his fourth studio album F.A.M.E. on October 25, 2010. It was written by Brown, DJ Frank E, Kevin McCall, Amber Streeter and Calvin Harris, and was produced by DJ Frank E. Brown recorded the song for his pop audience as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> a lot of mixtapes and urban records. [...] "Yeah 3x" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop, Europop, and electro house song; it uses a video game-type beat and features a thick bassline and big synth chords.

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante {{continued}} {{to write and}} record solo material. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> so {{since the age of}} nine, but had never considered releasing his material to the public. That was until several of his friends—including Johnny Depp, Perry Farrell, Gibby Haynes and former Red Hot Chili Peppers band mate Flea—encouraged him to release the material he wrote in his spare time during the Blood Sugar Sex Magik sessions. Frusciante began working on final cuts of the songs he had been writing, and producing them at his home in mid-1992. The production process, however, became hampered by his increasingly severe addiction to heroin. Usually Just a T-Shirt was recorded in the order it appears, with the final tracks being recorded shortly prior to Frusciante's departure from the Chili Peppers.

Wright said that he was looking to [...] "do a prologue where you see Pym as Ant-Man in action in the 60s, in sort of Tales to Astonish mode basically, and then the contemporary, sort of flash-forward, is Scott Lang's story, and how he comes to acquire the suit, how he crosses paths with Hank Pym, and then, in an interesting sort of Machiavellian way, teams up with him." [...] The next February, Wright said that the project was in [...] "a holding pattern" [...] while the script was being revised, and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> research for the film by studying nanotechnology.

500|$|Guitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament {{had played}} {{together}} in the pioneering grunge band Green River. Following Green River's dissolution in 1987, Ament and Gossard played together in Mother Love Bone during the late 1980s. Mother Love Bone's career was cut short when vocalist Andrew Wood died of a drug overdose in 1990, shortly before {{the release of the}} group's debut album, Apple. Devastated, it took months before Gossard and Ament agreed to play together again. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band Shadow had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. The three then went into the studio for separate sessions with Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron and former Shadow drummer Chris Friel to record some instrumental demos. Five of the songs recorded—"Dollar Short", [...] "Agytian Crave", [...] "Footsteps", [...] "Richard's E", and [...] "E Ballad"—were compiled onto a tape called Stone Gossard Demos '91 that was circulated in the hopes of finding a singer and drummer for the trio.|$|E

500|$|A soundtrack disc was {{included}} in the limited [...] "Augmented Edition". An official album, Deus Ex: Human Revolution Original Soundtrack, was released on November 15, 2011. It was released through Sumthing Else Music Works as a physical and digital release. The album contained 25 tracks created from 50 out of the 200 pieces created for the game. The tracks included both cues from the game and arranged versions used in trailers. McCann chose the tracks to represent the game's story, drawing on the various styles of the music as a whole. He used the official album release to accentuate what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> for the soundtrack as a whole. He initially wanted the soundtrack to be two discs, but realized that this would lead to repetition, so limited himself to a single disc. The remaining unreleased pieces were left out because of that potential repetition. The soundtrack received praise from multiple music critics: Original Sound Version's Gideon Dabi, commenting on the game's music prior to the album's commercial release, was highly positive about McCann's work, calling it [...] "a tremendous upgrade over its predecessors" [...] and praising its low-key impact. Simon Elchlepp, writing for Video Game Music Online, gave the album 4/5 stars: he called it [...] "a very satisfying experience", praising the score's connection to the game's themes and overall quality despite some perceived missteps about use of its main theme. RPGFan's Liz Maas said that, while it trended towards being generic, with the track [...] " [...] Barrett Boss Fight" [...] being most guilty of this, it managed to remain consistent with its themes and was worth buying.|$|E
500|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} first {{known to have}} been {{observed}} in 1885, two years after the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. It remains unclear whether their appearance {{had anything to do with}} the volcanic eruption or whether their discovery was due to more people observing the spectacular sunsets caused by the volcanic debris in the atmosphere. Studies have shown that noctilucent clouds are not caused solely by volcanic activity, although dust and water vapour could be injected into the upper atmosphere by eruptions and contribute to their formation. Scientists at the time assumed the clouds were another manifestation of volcanic ash, but after the ash had settled out of the atmosphere, the noctilucent clouds persisted. Finally, the theory that the clouds were composed of volcanic dust was disproved by Malzev in 1926. In the years following their discovery, the clouds were studied extensively by Otto Jesse of Germany, who was the first to photograph them, in 1887, and seems to have been the one to coin the term [...] "noctilucent cloud", which means [...] "night-shining cloud". His notes provide evidence that noctilucent clouds first appeared in 1885. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> detailed observations of the unusual sunsets caused by the Krakatoa eruption the previous year and firmly believed that, if the clouds had been visible then, he would undoubtedly have noticed them. Systematic photographic observations of the clouds were organized in 1887 by Jesse, Foerster, and Stolze and, after that year, continuous observations were carried out at the Berlin Observatory. During this research, the height of the clouds was first determined, via triangulation. The project was discontinued in 1896.|$|E
500|$|Skelton {{was unable}} to work in {{television}} {{until the end of}} his 1951 MGM movie contract; a renegotiation to extend the pact provided permission after that point. He signed a contract for television on NBC with Procter and Gamble as his sponsor on May 4, 1951, and said he would be performing the same characters on television as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> on radio. The MGM agreement with Skelton for television performances did not allow him to go on the air before September 30, 1951. His television debut, The Red Skelton Show, premiered on that date: {{at the end of his}} opening monologue, two men backstage grabbed his ankles from behind the set curtain, hauling him offstage face down. [...] A 1943 instrumental hit by David Rose, called [...] "Holiday for Strings", became Skelton's TV theme song. [...] The move to television allowed him to create two non-human characters, seagulls Gertrude and Heathcliffe, which he performed while the pair were flying by tucking his thumbs under his arms to represent wings and shaping his hat to look like a bird's bill. He patterned his meek, henpecked television character of George Appleby after his radio character, J. Newton Numbskull, who had similar characteristics. His [...] "Freddie the Freeloader" [...] clown was introduced on the program in 1952, with Skelton copying his father's makeup for the character. [...] He learned how to duplicate his father's makeup and perform his routines through his mother's recollections. [...] A ritual became established at the end of every program, with Skelton's shy boyish wave and words of, [...] "Good night and may God bless." ...|$|E
