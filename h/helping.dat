40|$|Purpose Online <b>help</b> and {{tutorials}} are {{an important}} part of library services, yet they are often studied in specific contexts and disciplines like subject-specific research guides. The objective of this study was to examine users’ common preferences and expectations of library <b>help</b> channels in general and online <b>help</b> in particular. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a qualitative survey with 45 library users. The survey asked users how they seek library <b>help,</b> their preferences and expectations of online <b>help,</b> content format and general <b>help</b> channels and later, a content analysis of survey responses was performed. Findings Results showed that survey participants have different prioritizations of library <b>help</b> channels. Half of the respondents preferred conceptual <b>help</b> that emphasizes concepts and underlying principles, while the other half preferred procedural (step-by-step) <b>help</b> or mixed. The survey also indicated reliance by participants on expert <b>help,</b> even when online <b>help</b> was available. Originality/value Based on the results, the authors identified users’ behavioral preferences, attitudes and expectations toward library <b>help</b> channels and online <b>help</b> content. They also discussed the unique challenge of creating online <b>help</b> for libraries, as users have a dynamic range of help-seeking preferences and mixed expectations of <b>help</b> content depending on the context...|$|R
40|$|Model-based {{interface}} design {{can save}} substantial effort in building <b>help</b> systems for interactive applications by generating <b>help</b> automatically {{from the model}} used to implement the interface, and by providing a framework for developers to easily refine the automatically-generated <b>help</b> texts.

The refinement component provides several levels of customization, including programming-by-example techniques to let developers edit directly <b>help</b> windows that the system produces, and the possibility to refine <b>help</b> generation rules.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 47 - 49) It was expected, in general, {{that users}} who could view <b>help</b> text simultaneously with task text would outperform {{those who could}} not. Four methods for presenting <b>help</b> were compared: WINDOW (a five line <b>help</b> display was presented simultaneously with the display of task text), DUAL (two lines of <b>help</b> were presented simultaneous with the task on the first <b>help</b> request, and a full screen overlayed the task on the next request), FULL (a full screen of <b>help</b> overlayed the task), and MANUAL (<b>help</b> was available off-line in a book). Two types of tasks were assigned to users in each <b>help</b> condition: SIMPLE (all necessary information to complete the tasks was given) and COMPLEX (users were forced to find and remember information pertinent to task completion). Typical computer tasks, such as file and job management were performed. Measures were taken for each set of simple or complex tasks. Dependent measures were 1) the average time to complete each task, 2) the number of steps taken beyond the optimal number for the set, 3) the average time spent in <b>help</b> per task, 4) the average time spent in <b>help</b> per request, 5) {{the average number of}} times <b>help</b> was accessed per task, and 6) the average total time to complete each task, including <b>help</b> time. The FULL <b>help</b> group spent significantly less time in <b>help</b> per task, and along with the DUAL <b>help</b> group, less time in <b>help</b> per request than did the other groups. However, FULL <b>help</b> users spent significantly longer in <b>help</b> per task than DUAL <b>help</b> users spent on the full screen of <b>help</b> presented to them per task...|$|R
