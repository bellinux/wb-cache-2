ATP citrate lyase (ACL), a key enzyme in de novo lipid synthesis, has been reported to be overex-pressed or activated in several cancer types. To determine the role of ACL in ovarian cancer progression, we detected ACL expression in human epithelial ovarian cancer tissues. qRT-PCR and western blotting showed higher ACL expres-sion in malignant tissues compared to normal ovarian tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that phosphorylated ACL was increased in ovarian cancer tissues and that <b>its</b> <b>expression</b> <b>correlated</b> well with tumor grade, FIGO stage and poorer prognosis. To explore the therapeutic potential of ACL, we assessed the effect of ACL-siRNA on cellular proliferation and cell cycle distribution. ACL knockdown inhibited cellular proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in A 2780 cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that ACL may contribute to the pathogenesis of human epithelial ovarian cancer, and may serve as a novel therapeutic target...|$|E

The aim of this work was to detect the expression of c-met during postnatal testis development and to study its functional role. Our findings show that in total rat testis e-met is expressed during postnatal life until the sexual maturation of the animals. To evaluate the receptor expression in the different cell types in the testis, homogeneous cell populations of Sertoli and peritubular myoid cells were isolated from the seminiferous tubules of 10 - and 35 -day-old animals. c-met gene is expressed in myoid cells at the ages considered and <b>its</b> <b>expression</b> decreases with increasing age. By contrast, in Sertoli cells c-met expression is first detectable at 25 days of Life and <b>its</b> <b>expression</b> increases with the increasing age being well evident at 35 days of age.

As a consequence of HGF addition, Sertoli cells cultured on reconstituted basement membrane reorganize into cord-like structures that resemble testicular seminiferous cords. The data here reported demonstrate for the first: time that in Sertoli cells c-met expression is developmentally regulated being present and functionally active in postpuberal Sertoli cells.

The cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP- 1) gene expression was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry assay on LaCa tissues. To identify prognostic feature, CRBP- 1 gene gain was correlated to patient survival. RESULTS: The most common gains were detected for CRBP- 1 and EGFR genes, while DNA lost in RAF- 1 gene. Immunohistochemistry assay was revealed strong expression of CRBP 1 protein in those cases with CRBP- 1 gene gain.

Akt kinase interacting protein 1 (Aki 1; Freud- 1 /CC 2 D 1 A) is a scaffold protein for the PI 3 K–PDK 1 –Akt signaling module that helps determine receptor signal selectivity for EGFR.

Taken together, our findings provide direct mechanistic evidence of the involvement of SOX 9 in neoplastic pathobiology, particularly, in colorectal cancer. © 2012 AACR. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: This study {{investigated}} the clinical relevance and biological function of paired box gene 2 (PAX 2) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods/Results: Results showed that PAX 2 expression was significantly increased in tumor tissues and that <b>its</b> <b>expression</b> <b>correlated</b> with the ESCC stage (P = 0. 001), lymph node metastasis (pN, P = 0. 019) and lymphatic invasion (P = 0. 005) in 120 ESCC tissue specimens by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, PAX 2 overexpression resulted in markedly reduced cell proliferation but increased metastasis capacity in ESCC TE- 1 and Eca- 109 cells. Knockdown of PAX 2 expression with a short hairpin RNA confirmed {{a role in the}} promotion of metastasis in ESCC cells. mRNA microarray screening revealed that PAX 2 overexpression affected multiple genes that function in multiple pathways. Interleukin- 5 (IL- 5), which was induced by PAX 2 and has been shown to promote tumor metastasis, was further studied in greater detail. Two PAX 2 binding sites were identified in the IL- 5 promoter, and PAX 2 was observed to stimulate IL- 5 promoter activity and IL- 5 expression in esophageal cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) confirmed the direct binding of PAX 2 in the IL- 5 promoter. The expression of PAX 2 mRNA significantly correlated with that of IL- 5 in normal esophageal and ESCC tissues. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that PAX 2 is overexpressed in esophageal carcinoma and IL- 5 is identified as PAX 2 's effector for metastasis...|$|E
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{emerging}} role of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) as a novel therapeutical approach in myocardial ischemia, we performed the first two-way parallel comparison to test the effects of rhEPO pretreatment (1000 U/kg, 12 h before surgery) versus EPO transgenic overexpression in a mouse model of myocardial infarction. Unlike EPO transgenic mice who doubled their hematocrit, rhEPO pretreated mice maintained an unaltered hematocrit, thereby offering the possibility to discern erythropoietic-dependent from erythropoietic-independent protective effects of EPO. Animals pretreated with rhEPO as well as EPO transgenic mice underwent permanent left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation. Resulting infarct size was determined 24 h after LAD ligation by hematoxylin/eosin staining, and morphometrical analysis was performed by computerized planimetry. A large reduction in infarction size was observed in rhEPO-treated mice (- 74 % +/- 14. 51; P = 0. 0002) and an even more pronounced reduction in the EPO transgenic group (- 87 % +/- 6. 31; P < 0. 0001) when compared to wild-type controls. Moreover, while searching for novel early ischemic markers, we analyzed expression of hypoxia-sensitive Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (WT 1) in infarcted hearts. We found that <b>its</b> <b>expression</b> <b>correlated</b> with the infarct area, thereby providing the first demonstration that WT 1 is a useful early marker of myocardial infarction. This study demonstrates {{for the first time}} that, despite high hematocrit levels, endogenously overexpressed EPO provides protection against myocardial infarction in a murine model of permanent LAD ligation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{blood-brain barrier}} (BBB) {{is a term}} used to {{describe}} the unique properties of central nervous system (CNS) blood vessels. One important BBB property is the formation of a paracellular barrier made by tight junctions (TJs) between CNS endothelial cells (ECs). Here, we show that Lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR), a component of paracellular junctions at points in which three cell membranes meet, is greatly enriched in CNS ECs compared with ECs in other nonneural tissues. We demonstrate that LSR is specifically expressed at tricellular junctions and that <b>its</b> <b>expression</b> <b>correlates</b> with the onset of BBB formation during embryogenesis. We further demonstrate that the BBB does not seal during embryogenesis in Lsr knockout mice with a leakage to small molecules. Finally, in mouse models in which BBB was disrupted, including an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis and a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke, LSR was down-regulated, linking loss of LSR and pathological BBB leakage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMatrix metalloproteinase- 1 (MMP- 1) is a {{potential}} biomarker for chondrosarcoma that is overexpressed at the invading edges of articular cartilage, and <b>its</b> <b>expression</b> <b>correlates</b> with poor survival rates. However, the molecular mechanisms of MMP- 1 regulation and its potential contribution to chondrosarcoma cell invasion {{have yet to be}} elucidated, especially in shear-activated cells. Using molecular biology tools and an in vitro fluid shear model, we report that shear stress upregulates cyclic AMP (cAMP) and interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) release, which in turn promotes the invasion of chondrosarcoma cells via the induction of MMP- 1 in a phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 -K) - and ERK 1 / 2 -dependent manner. Activated PI 3 -K and ERK 1 / 2 signaling pathways phosphorylate c-Jun, which in turn transactivates MMP- 1 in human chondrosarcoma cells. Collectively, fluid shear stress upregulates matrix MMP- 1 expression, which is responsible for the enhanced invasion of human chondrosarcoma cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} {{expression}} of annexin 1 in urothelial carcinoma (UC) and its relation with clinicopathologic factors, and evaluates its potential clinical significance. Annexin 1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining with manual tissue microarrays and Western blot in UC. Immunohistochemical analysis of UC in tissue microarrays showed that annexin 1 protein was 76. 5 % (150 / 196) positive, which was markedly increased compared with that in the normal urothelium 20. 8 % (5 / 24) (p <  0. 01). In addition, the positive expression rate of annexin 1 was higher in the high-grade UC (81. 7 %; 143 / 175) than in the low-grade UC (33. 3 %; 7 / 21). Western blot revealed that {{the expression of}} annexin 1 was low in low-grade UC, and markedly increased in high-grade UC. In conclusion, annexin 1 overexpression is observed in UC, which suggests it {{may be associated with}} tumorigenesis and <b>its</b> <b>expression</b> <b>correlates</b> with the differentiation of UC...|$|R
