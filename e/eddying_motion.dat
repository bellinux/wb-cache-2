40|$|Turbulence is a {{familiar}} phenomenon which gives rise to complicated problems in many branches of engineering. Hinze has set forth the following definition for turbulence: 2 ̆ 2 Turbulent fluid motion is an irregular condition of flow in which the various quantities show a random variation in time pnd space coordinates, so that statistically distinct average values can be discerned. 2 ̆ 2 Osborne Reynolds (1894) {{was the first to}} introduce the notion of statistical mean values into the study of turbulence. He visualized turbulent flow as the sum of mean and <b>eddying</b> <b>motion.</b> By introducing this sum of mean velocity and fluctuating velocity into the Navier-Stokes equations and with the aid of the continuity equation, he derived equations giving relationships between the various components of the fluctuating velocity. It was soon realized that before any further results could be obtained from a theoretical analysis of Reynold;s equations of motion, a mechanism had to be postulated for the ihteraction of fluctuating v locity components at different points in the turbulent field. Consequently, three decades after Reynold 2 ̆ 7 s: work, phenomenological theories of turbulence, such as the momentum-transfer theory of Prandtl (1926), the vorticity transport theory of Taylor (1932) and the similarity theory of Karman (1930) were introduced. Not only are they based on unrealistic physical models, but they do not furnish any information beyond temporal-mean velocity distribution. A complete theory of turbulence should describe the mechanism of production of turbulence, its convection, diffusion, distribution, and eventual dissipation for any given boundary conditions...|$|E

(2002, hereafter CKV) are not inconsistent with the presence of an annular mode (AM) in the numerical model used. He suggests that the zonally asymmetric character of CKV’s AM events is due to the superposition of independent annular and nonannular features, with AMs being (presumably) a real dynamical phenomenon independent of the zonally asymmetric <b>eddying</b> <b>motion.</b> However, while it may be impossible to rule out the presence of such an AM in the CKV experiments, {{we do not believe that}} the AMs, thus interpreted, necessarily best represent the underlying dynamical behavior of the model. The AM problem has descriptive aspects and dynamical aspects. In CKV, we look for useful statistical descriptions of the spatial structure of extratropical atmospheric low-frequency variability in an aquaplanet model. We calculate the leading EOF of the hemispheric-wide surface pressure and the leading EOF of the zonal-mean surface pressure. We find that these two structures have practically identical meridional structures (Fig. 1); that is, the zonal mean of the hemisphericwide surface pressure EOF is the same as the EOF of the zonal-mean surface pressure. The meridional structure of the AMs is similar to the zonal mean of circulation anomalies in smaller zonal sectors. One way of seeing this is to calculate the leading EOF of the surface pressure in a 90 � longitude sector (CKV, Fig. 11). The zonal mean of this structure, shown as a dotted line in Fig. 1, is also very similar to the other two curves in the figure.

40|$|Reynolds {{proposed}} that after sufficiently long times, the flow in a pipe should settle {{to a steady}} condition: below a critical Reynolds number, flows should (regardless of initial conditions) always return to laminar, while above, <b>eddying</b> <b>motion</b> should persist. As shown, even in pipes several thousand diameters long, the spatio-temporal intermittent flow patterns observed {{at the end of}} the pipe strongly depend on the initial conditions, with no indication of an approach to a (statistical) steady state. Exploiting the fact that turbulent puffs do not age, we continuously recreate the puff sequence exiting the pipe at the entrance, thus introducing periodic boundary conditions for the flow pattern. This procedure allows us to study the evolution of the flow patterns for arbitrary long times. We find that after times in excess of $ 10 ^ 7 $ advective time units, a statistical steady state is reached. Though the resulting flows remain spatio-temporally intermittent, puff splitting and decay rates eventually reach a balance so that the turbulent fraction fluctuates around a well defined level which only depends on $Re$. We find that at lower $Re$ (here 2020), flows eventually always laminarize, while for higher $Re$ ($>= 2060 $) turbulence persists. The critical point for pipe flow hence lies in the interval $ 2020 <Re_c< 2060 $, which is in good agreement with the recently proposed value of $Re_c= 2040 $. The latter estimate was based on single puff statistics and entirely neglected puff interactions. Unlike typical contact processes where such interactions strongly affect the critical point, in pipe flow it is only marginally influenced. Interactions on the other hand, are responsible for the approach to the statistical steady state. As shown, they strongly affect the resulting flow patterns, where they cause `puff clustering', with the clusters traveling across the puff pattern in a wave like fashion...|$|E
40|$|Flows {{observed}} in open channels are usually turbulent. The word 2 ̆ 2 turbulent 2 ̆ 2 describes a motion {{in which an}} irregular velocity fluctuation (mixing or <b>eddying</b> <b>motion)</b> is superimposed on the main stream motion. The essential characteristic of turbulent flow is that the turbulent fluctuations are random in nature. If Reynold 2 ̆ 7 s rule of averaging is used, the Navier-Stokes equations for laminar flow may be transformed into the Reynold 2 ̆ 7 s equations, which hold true for turbulent mean motion. The solution of Reynold 2 ̆ 7 s equations will properly describe turbulent flow. Unfortunately, the number of unknowns exceeds the number of equations; therefore the use of mathematical method to solve turbulent flow problems is extremely difficult and not possible at present. The details of turbulent flow are so complicated that a statistical approach must be used. Extensive {{research has been done}} in this regard during the last few decades. G. I. Taylor (1935) presented a statistical theory of turbulence based on the assumption of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. He introduced various concepts such as turbulence intensity, correlation coefficient, scale of turbulence, and energy spectrum. Kolmogoroff (1941) introduced the theory of locally isotropic turbulence. He postulated that turbulent motion at large Reynold 2 ̆ 7 s number is locally isotropic whether or not the large scale motions are isotropic. He also introduced the concept that the small scale motions are mainly governed by viscous forces and the amounts of energy which are handed down to them from the large eddies. Other investigations of isotropic turbulence have been made by Karman (1938), Heisenberg (1948), Lin (1948), etc. Even for the simplest type of turbulence (i. e. isotropic turbulence), {{it is not possible to}} obtain the general solution to the equations because the details of turbulence are so complicated. Present knowledge about the statistical distribution of non-homogeneous turbulence is even less extensive. Therefore, before real use can be made of the statistical theory of turbulence much work must be done...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This study investigates the complex flow structure generated by riparian emergent vegetation {{along the edge of}} floodplain. Detailed velocity and boundary shear stress measurements were carried out for various arrangements of emergent rigid cylindric rods of 3 mm, 6 mm and 9 mm diameters and for three different rod densities. In addition, the impact of foliage on the flow field was assessed during a series of experiments where brushes were used instead of smooth rods. The results of these new experiments are first presented. In addition to the laboratory data, field data was obtained through Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler measurements for two flood events in a stretch of the river Rhône that can be approximated to a straight compound channel with vegetated banks. The analysis of the flow structure highlights the presence of strong secondary circulation and increased vorticity on the river banks. The rods {{on the edge of the}} floodplain increase significantly flow resistance, reducing velocity and decreasing boundary shear stress. Flow rate was seen to decrease with increasing vegetative density for all cases except when foliage was added. This suggests that an optimum threshold density, for which a smaller density would lead to an increased flow rate might exist. Wakes trailing downstream of the vegetation stem, planform coherent structures advected between the main channel and the floodplain, and <b>eddying</b> <b>motion</b> in the flow due to enhanced turbulence anisotropy are among the defining patterns observed in the studied compound channel flows with one line of emergent vegetation along the edge of the floodplain. The Shiono and Knight Method (SKM) was modified in order to account for the increased turbulence activity due to the rods.

40|$|Experiments {{are done}} using a smooth solid rigid {{homogeneous}} acrylic sphere rolling on an inclined plane which is submerged in water. The motivation for these experiments {{comes from a}} need to understand a class of solid-fluid interaction problems that include sediment transport, movement of gravel on ocean floor and river bed due to water currents. Experiments are performed in a glass water tank 15 cm wide by 14 cm deep by 61 cm long which can be tilted to desired angle. The sphere is released from rest on the inclined false bottom of the tank in quiescent water. Our experimental study has twofold aim: (1) to study the boundary layer separation, the three-dimensional <b>eddying</b> <b>motion</b> in the wake and the near-wake structure and(2) to establish hydrodynamic force coefficients by analyzing kinematical data of the sphere motion from start to till it attains terminal velocity. Experiments are carried out at moderate Reynolds number Rearound 1500. Previous studies on the first problem {{exist in the literature}} for Reup to 350. Previous studies on the second problem do not clearly define the added-mass coefficient and the influence of the water tank side-walls on the drag coefficient. In the first study, the characterization of the wake is done using flow visualization methods (fluoresce in dye visualization and particle streak visualization) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Laser light sheet obtained from an argon ion continuous laser beam is taken in different orientations to illuminate the fluoresce in dye or 14 m silver-coated hollow glass spheres. These experiments show that the wake behind the rolling sphere up to 1. 6 diameters (or 1. 6 D) downstream is confined within height 1. 2 Dand width 1. 2 D. At about 1. 8 Ddownstream, the wake sways alternately {{on either side of the}} equatorial plane, moving in lateral-vertical direction and moving out of the confining region; this gives zigzag appearance to the wake. Also in these experiments, we observe that the flow separations from the surface of the rolling sphere show three separation zones. The eddies shed from the primary separation surface on the upper hemisphere are symmetrical about the equatorial plane with Strouhal number St= 1. 0. The primary separation is affected by the symmetrical secondary separations on the rear surface in the piggyback region — it is the region near the upper rear surface of the sphere behind the transverse equatorial plane and below the primary separation surface. The lower eddies below the primary separation zone are shed alternately on either side of the equatorial plane with shedding frequency St= 0. 5. Our experiments show that there is a viscous blockage of width 0. 4 Dat the crevice near the point of contact. On either side of the viscous blockage at the crevice, we see weak symmetric eddies. Based on our experimental observations, we proceed to build a simple physical model of the separated flow on the surface of the rolling sphere. In the second study, the motion of the sphere is photographed and paired data of the displacement and time is obtained for the sphere motion from the start of motion till terminal velocity is reached at about 4. 5 sphere diameters from the point of release of the sphere. Equation of motion of the sphere is solved numerically treating added-mass coefficient Ca and drag coefficient Cd as parameters. Experimental data is fitted on these solutions and the best fit gives the values of the force coefficients. Theoretical value of Ca equal to 0. 621 is confirmed experimentally. Value of Cd is found to be 1. 23 at Re= 990 and it is 1. 06 at Re= 1900. Side-wall effects become important for ratio of diameter of sphere to width of tank greaterthan 0. 20...|$|E

Since the transport eddies that are responsible for the blending have sizes that are constrained by the boundary layer depth, and since the vertical motion is so important under the unstable density stratification studied here, we see that a hen the length scales of the source variability on the land surface become significantly greater than the ABL depth the blending is lost. In this case the source fields remain relatively uncoupled by the important <b>eddy</b> <b>motion.</b> However, for smaller surface length scales, the dynamic <b>eddy</b> <b>motion</b> couples the surface patches.

Moreover, the mean fields of potential temperature and specific humidity blend at much lower heights than do the vertical turbulent flux fields of these two scalars.

At the same time, pictures of flow patterns were taken every halfa second by the camera mounted above the channel. Illuminated cross-section and the camera wereboth shifted downstream with mean velocity of the flow. Pictures obtained were processed bycomputer system and distribution of velocity vectors, rotation and two-dimensional divergence wereobtained concerning each horizontal cross-section of the flow. On {{the basis of these}} results, downward or upward motion of fluid such as boils, bursts or sweepswere illustrated precisely and their distribution in three-dimensional flow field and their relationwith <b>eddy</b> <b>motions</b> were made clear...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent gas motions will induce random {{velocities}} {{of small}} dust grains that are imbedded in the gas. Within large eddies the friction {{forces from the}} gas lead to strongly correlated velocities for neighboring grains, whereas small eddies cause uncorrelated grain motions. The nonlinear response of a grain to <b>eddy</b> <b>motion</b> is calculated. This leads to a turbulent pressure within the dust component {{as well as to}} collisions between pairs of grains. The results are evaluated numerically for a Kolmogoroff spectrum and turbulent collision rates are calculated for molecular clouds and protostellar environments. Whereas grain-grain collisions should not modify the initial size distribution in molecular clouds to a significant extent, they will lead to an entirely different grain population in protostars...|$|R
