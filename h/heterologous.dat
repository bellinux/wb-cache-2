Industrial processes have been recently developed using viral vectors and a number of pharmaceutical proteins are currently in pre-clinical and clinical trials.|$|E
5|$|Plant virus {{particles}} or virus-like particles (VLPs) have applications in both biotechnology and nanotechnology. The capsids of most plant viruses are simple and robust structures {{and can be}} produced in large quantities either by the infection of plants or by expression {{in a variety of}} <b>heterologous</b> systems. Plant {{virus particles}} can be modified genetically and chemically to encapsulate foreign material and can be incorporated into supramolecular structures for use in biotechnology.|$|E

25|$|Past {{and ongoing}} {{research}} continues to elucidate the many biological functions of sulfatide and their many implications {{as well as}} the pathology that has been associated with sulfatide. Most research utilizes mice models, but <b>heterologous</b> expression systems are utilized as well, including, but not limited to, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and COS-7 Cells.|$|E
25|$|Considered a very {{versatile}} {{host for}} the production of <b>heterologous</b> proteins, researchers can introduce genes into the microbes using plasmids, allowing for the mass production of proteins in industrial fermentation processes. Genetic systems have also been developed which allow the production of recombinant proteins using E. coli. One of the first useful applications of recombinant DNA technology was the manipulation of E. coli to produce human insulin. Modified E. coli have been used in vaccine development, bioremediation, and production of immobilised enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases (protein kinase A) are {{activated}} by the signal chain {{coming from the}} G protein (that was {{activated by}} the receptor) via adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP (cAMP). In a feedback mechanism, these activated kinases phosphorylate the receptor. The longer the receptor remains active the more kinases are activated and the more receptors are phosphorylated. In β2-adrenoceptors, this phosphorylation results in the switching of the coupling from the Gs class of G-protein to the Gi class. cAMP-dependent PKA mediated phosphorylation can cause <b>heterologous</b> desensitisation in receptors other than those activated.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 {{antibody}} {{therapy was}} used to treat tetanus, when serum from immunized horses was injected into patients with severe tetanus {{in an attempt to}} neutralize the tetanus toxin, and prevent the dissemination of the disease. Since the 1960s, human tetanus immune globulin (TIG) has been used in the United States in unimmunized, vaccine-naive or incompletely immunized patients who have sustained wounds consistent with the development of tetanus. The administration of horse antitoxin remains the only specific pharmacologic treatment available for botulism. Antitoxin also known as <b>heterologous</b> hyperimmune serum is often also given prophylactically to individuals known to have ingested contaminated food. IVIG treatment was also used successfully to treat several victims of toxic shock syndrome, during the 1970s tampon scare.|$|E
25|$|In the past, spherical nonporous {{implants}} {{were placed}} in the intraconal space and the extraocular muscles were either left unattached or were tied over the implant. Wrapping these implants allows attachment of the muscles to the covering material, a technique that seems to improve implant movement and reduce the incidence of implant migration. Porous implants may be saturated with antibiotic solution before insertion. Because the brittle nature of hydroxyapatite prevents direct suturing of the muscles to the implant, these implants are usually covered with some form of wrapping material. The muscles are attached to the implant in a technique similar to that used for spherical non-porous implants. The muscles may be directly sutured to porous polyethylene implants either by passing the suture through the implant material or by using an implant with fabricated suture tunnels. Some surgeons also wrap porous polyethylene implants either to facilitate muscle attachment or {{to reduce the risk of}} implant exposure. A variety of wrapping materials have been used to cover porous implants, including polyglactin or polyglycolic acid mesh, <b>heterologous</b> tissue (bovine pericardium), homologous donor tissue (sclera, dermis), and autogenous tissue (fascia lata, temporalis fascia, posterior auricular muscle, rectus abdominis sheath).|$|E
2500|$|Also {{known as}} <b>heterologous</b> or [...] "Jennerian" [...] {{vaccines}}, these are vaccines that are pathogens {{of other animals}} that either do not cause disease or cause mild disease in the organism being treated. The classic example is Jenner's use of cowpox to protect against smallpox. A current example {{is the use of}} BCG vaccine made from Mycobacterium bovis to protect against human tuberculosis.|$|E
2500|$|PKC/PKA may, instead, phosphorylate GRKs, {{which can}} also lead to GPCR {{phosphorylation}} and [...] β-arrestin binding in an occupation-independent manner. These latter two mechanisms allow for desensitization of one GPCR due to the activities of others, or <b>heterologous</b> desensitization. GRKs may also have GAP domains and so may contribute to inactivation through non-kinase mechanisms as well. A combination of these mechanisms may also occur.|$|E
2500|$|GPCRs become {{desensitized}} {{when exposed}} to their ligand for a prolonged period of time. [...] There are two recognized forms of desensitization: 1) homologous desensitization, in which the activated GPCR is downregulated; and 2) <b>heterologous</b> desensitization, wherein the activated GPCR causes downregulation of a different GPCR. The key reaction of this downregulation is the phosphorylation of the intracellular (or cytoplasmic) receptor domain by protein kinases.|$|E
2500|$|G-protein-coupled {{receptor}} oligomerisation is {{a widespread}} phenomenon. [...] One of the best-studied examples is the metabotropic GABAB receptor. This so-called constitutive receptor is formed by heterodimerization of GABABR1 and GABABR2 subunits. Expression of the GABABR1 without the GABABR2 in <b>heterologous</b> systems leads to retention of the subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum. [...] Expression of the GABABR2 subunit alone, meanwhile, leads to surface expression of the subunit, although with no functional activity (i.e., the receptor does not bind agonist and cannot initiate a response following exposure to agonist). Expression of the two subunits together leads to plasma membrane expression of functional receptor. [...] It {{has been shown that}} GABABR2 binding to GABABR1 causes masking of a retention signal of functional receptors.|$|E
2500|$|Contrasting {{with the}} high-affinity SERT, the PMAT has been {{identified}} as a low-affinity transporter, with an apparent Km of 114 micromoles/l for serotonin; approximately 230 times higher than that of SERT. However, the PMAT, despite its relatively low serotonergic affinity, has a considerably higher transport 'capacity' than SERT, [...] "resulting in roughly comparable uptake efficiencies to SERT in <b>heterologous</b> expression systems." [...] The study also suggests some SSRIs, such as fluoxetine and sertraline anti-depressants, inhibit PMAT but at IC50 values which surpass the therapeutic plasma concentrations by up to four orders of magnitude. Therefore, SSRI monotherapy is [...] "ineffective" [...] in PMAT inhibition. At present, no known pharmaceuticals are known to appreciably inhibit PMAT at normal therapeutic doses. The PMAT also suggestively transports dopamine and norepinephrine, albeit at Km values even higher than that of 5-HT (330–15,000 μmoles/L).|$|E
2500|$|The antigen Thy-1 was {{the first}} T cell marker [...] to be identified. Thy-1 was {{discovered}} [...] by Reif and Allen in 1964 during a search for <b>heterologous</b> antisera against mouse leukemia cells, and was demonstrated by them to be present on murine thymocytes, on T lymphocytes, and on neuronal cells. [...] It was originally named theta (θ) antigen, then Thy-1 (THYmocyte differentiation antigen 1) due to its prior identification in thymocytes (precursors of T cells in the thymus). The human homolog was isolated in 1980 as a 25kDa protein (p25) of T-lymphoblastoid cell line MOLT-3 binding with anti-monkey-thymocyte antisera. The discovery of Thy-1 in mice and humans led to the subsequent discovery of many other T cell markers, which is very significant {{to the field of}} immunology since T cells (along with B cells) are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heterologous</b> gene {{expression}} {{is used in}} many biotechnological applications, including protein production and metabolic engineering. Because tRNA pools vary between different organisms, the rate of transcription and translation of a particular coding sequence can be less efficient when placed in a non-native context. For an overexpressed transgene, the corresponding mRNA makes a large percent of total cellular RNA, {{and the presence of}} rare codons along the transcript can lead to inefficient use and depletion of ribosomes and ultimately reduce levels of <b>heterologous</b> protein production. However, using codons that are optimized for tRNA pools in a particular host to overexpress a <b>heterologous</b> gene may also cause amino acid starvation and alter the equilibrium of tRNA pools. This method of adjusting codons to match host tRNA abundances, called codon optimization, has traditionally been used for expression of a <b>heterologous</b> gene. However, new strategies for optimization of <b>heterologous</b> expression consider global nucleotide content such as local mRNA folding, codon pair bias, a codon ramp or codon correlations.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Heterologous</b> {{expression}} {{refers to}} {{the expression of a}} gene or part of a gene in a host organism, which does not naturally have this gene or gene fragment. Insertion of the gene in the <b>heterologous</b> host is performed by recombinant DNA technology. The gene is inserted to this host, it can be integrated into the host DNA causing permanent expression, or not integrated causing transient expression of this gene. <b>Heterologous</b> expression can be done in many type of host organisms. The host organism can be a bacterium, yeast, mammalian cell, or plant cell. This host is called the [...] "expression system".|$|E
50|$|It is {{well known}} from animal studies that infections, apart from {{inducing}} pathogen-specific T-cells, also induce cross-reactive T-cells through epitope sharing, so-called <b>heterologous</b> immunity. <b>Heterologous</b> T-cell immunity can lead to improved clearance of a subsequent cross-reactive challenge, {{but it may also}} lead to increased morbidity. This mechanism may explain why DTP could have negative effects.|$|E
5000|$|In {{structural}} biology a <b>heterologous</b> association is a binding mode between the protomers of a protein structure. [...] In a <b>heterologous</b> association, each protomer contributes {{a different set}} of residues to the binding interface. In contrast, two protomers form an isologous association when they contribute the same set of residues to the protomer-protomer interface.|$|E

50|$|The Human genome {{varies in}} size; however, the current {{estimate}} of the nuclear haploid size of the reference human genome is 3,031,042,417 bp for the X gamete and 2,932,228,937 bp for the Y gamete. The X gamete and Y gamete both contain 22 autosomes whose combined lengths comprise {{the majority of the}} genome in both gametes. The X gamete contains an X chromosome, while the Y gamete contains a Y chromosome. The larger size of the X chromosome is responsible for the difference {{in the size of the}} two gametes. When the gametes are combined, the XX female zygote has a size of 6,062,084,834 bp while the XY male zygote has a size 5,963,271,354 bp. However, the base pairs of the XX female zygote are distributed among 2 homologous groups of 23 <b>heterologous</b> chromosomes each, while the base pairs of the XY male zygote are distributed among 2 homologous groups of 22 <b>heterologous</b> chromosomes each plus 2 <b>heterologous</b> chromosomes. Although each zygote has 46 chromosomes, 23 chromosomes of the XX female zygote are <b>heterologous</b> while 24 chromosomes of the XY male zygote are <b>heterologous.</b> As a result, the C-value for the XX female zygote is 3.099361 while the C-value for the XY male zygote is 3.157877.|$|E
