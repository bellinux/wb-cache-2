30|$|Much of the {{theoretical}} finance literature uses annual returns from different investments, including timber, for comparing risk and return, Capital Asset Pricing, and portfolio optimisation (e.g., Redmond and Cubbage 1988, Cascio and Clutter 2008, Mei and Clutter 2010). Internal rate of return is often used {{as a proxy for}} annual returns in the <b>forest</b> <b>finance</b> literature, making it comparable other asset class analyses. So use of annual returns and IRR are widely accepted even in theory for finance applications. Internal rate of return also remains in wide use in the forest products industry. Hogaboam and Shook (2004) found that 52 % of forest products firms used IRR as their preferred capital budgeting criteria, versus only 18 % who preferred NPV. Last, IRR or annual rate of return surely is the most common metric referred to in timber investment conferences and by TIMOs and REITs (e.g., Leal 2008).|$|E

40|$|The {{attached}} {{study and}} options for forest-related financing have built on previous {{work by the}} Advisory Group on Finance (AGF) of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF) in 2008. The first time <b>forest</b> <b>financing</b> was taken up at the multilateral level was 20 years ago, at the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A critical standoff occurred in Rio between developed and developing countries on <b>financing</b> for <b>forests.</b> By and large, developed countries said that existing mechanisms were sufficient, while later in 2007 they agreed that forests required new and additional financing. Developing countries have consistently asked for a global forest fund. Countries failed to agree in Rio both on how to address the modalities of a forest institutional structure or to gain a commitment to a global forest fund. In 2000 the UN Forum on Forests (UNFF) was created. In 2007, a comprehensive agreement was reached on a framework for an international agreement on forests. It was {{agreed that it was}} not “legally binding, ” but the scope and issues were agreed by the then 192 countries in the United Nations and endorsed by the UN General Assembly.

40|$|A clear legal {{framework}} and supportive institutional environment, including technical and businesses services, encourage commercial banks community forest concessions. Globally, {{the past few}} decades have seen exponential growth and development in the microfinance sector. The worldwide movement to promote small-scale financing for micro and small enterprises has reached over 94 million clients (González and Rosenberg, 2006). Despite this significant outreach, large segments of the population in many developing countries continue to be underserved by financial services. One of the key challenges facing the microfinance sector is how to “expand the frontiers ” so that financial institutions can sustainably provide services to populations outside urban centres in the most remote rural areas. Forest communities often have limited access to financial services. The microfinance and development banking sectors are increasingly focusing on how to reach rural areas, but the focus is generally on agriculture. Little consideration has been given to reaching small-scale forest enterprises. Governments and international development agencies have mainly focused their attention to <b>forest</b> <b>finance</b> on creating appropriate incentives for forest conservation; they have been less concerned with the provision of adequate financial services for the business cycles of those making a living from the forest. Financial services principally include credit, savings, insurance, money transfers and leasing. These services allow people and enterprises to distribute their expenditures over time – so that what they can’t pay now with their current income, they can pay with past income (through savings or insurance), future income (through loans) or a combination of both (Rutherford, 2000).

40|$|The {{international}} {{climate change}} regime {{has the potential}} to increase revenue available for forest restoration projects in Commonwealth nations. There are three mechanisms which could be used to fund forest projects aimed at forest conservation, forest restoration and sustainable forest management. The first forest funding opportunity arises under the clean development mechanism, a flexibility mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. The clean development mechanism allows Annex I parties (industrialised nations) to invest in emission reduction activities in non-Annex 1 (developing countries) and the establishment of forest sinks is an eligible clean development mechanism activity. Secondly, parties to the Kyoto Protocol are able to include sustainable forest management activities in their national carbon accounting. The international rules concerning this are called the Land-Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry Guidelines. Thirdly, it is anticipated that at the upcoming Copenhagen negotiations that a Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) instrument will be created. This will provide a direct funding mechanism for those developing countries with tropical forests. Payments made under a REDD arrangement will be based upon the developing country with tropical forest cover agreeing to protect and conserve a designated forest estate. These three funding options available under the international climate change regime demonstrate that there is potential for <b>forest</b> <b>finance</b> within the regime. These opportunities are however hindered by a number of technical and policy barriers which prevent the ability of the regime to significantly increase funding for forest projects. There are two types of carbon markets, compliance carbon markets (Kyoto based) and voluntary carbon markets. Voluntary carbon markets are more flexible then compliance markets and as such offer potential to increase revenue available for sustainable forest projects...|$|E

40|$|REDD+ schemes {{are likely}} to be {{important}} parts of climate change mitigation strategies for developing countries in a post-Kyoto framework. Many tropical forest countries have been preparing their REDD+ structures in anticipation of the requirements for REDD+ investment. Indonesia, as one of the main REDD+ supporters, is struggling to establish its governance framework and REDD+ infrastructure while waiting for the REDD+ mechanism to be ready for implementation at the global level. Demonstration activities are being conducted and several policy documents and regulations have been released since 2007. However, some issues remain outstanding, including land tenure, institutional fragmentation, <b>forest</b> <b>financing</b> and details of project methodologies raising concerns as to whether a REDD+ scheme can be implemented to effectively reduce Indonesia’s greenhouse gas emissions. This paper examines Indonesia’s efforts to remove those barriers and proposes some options for policy improvement. Among other issues, reduction of institutional fragmentation should be the highest priority action for Indonesia in the short term. With a clear institutional framework, REDD+ implementation will be easier to manage and potentially increase investor confidence in REDD+ projects in Indonesi...|$|R

40|$|The {{problems}} that hamper the <b>financing</b> of sustainable <b>forest</b> management (SFM) are manifold and complex. However, forestry is also facing unprecedented opportunities. The multiple functions {{and values of}} forests are increasingly recognized {{as part of the}} solution to pressing global issues (e. g., climate change, energy scarcity, poverty, environmental degradation, biodiversity loss and raw material supply). Emerging initiatives to enhance forest carbon stocks and cut greenhouse gas emissions associated with forest clearing (known as REDD+), together with voluntary carbon markets, are offering additional funding options for SFM. Indigenous peoples, local communities and small scale farmers feature as key players in the discourse on implementing such initiatives. Based on the experience of countries developing national <b>forest</b> <b>financing</b> strategies and instruments, we suggest the following points be considered when financing such initiatives, particularly for small scale forestry: (1) Integrate financing of REDD+ and similar initiatives within broader national strategies for SFM financing; (2) Design REDD+ finance mechanisms that are ‘community ready’, i. e., tailored to local realities; (3) Consider existing livelihood strategies as the starting point; (4) Build on existing structures, but be mindful of their strengths and weaknesses; (5) Be strategic with your priority actions; and (6) Promote innovation, knowledge sharing and information exchange...|$|R

5000|$|Costa Rica's PES program, Pagos por servicios ambientales (PSA) was {{established}} in 1997, {{and was the first}} PES program to be implemented on a national scale. It came on the back of Forestry Law 7575 of 1996 which prioritized environmental services over other forest activities such as timber production, and which established the national fund for <b>forest</b> <b>financing</b> (Fondo Nacional de Financiamento Forestal), FONAFIFO. The PSA follows several years of different environmental programs in Costa Rica including the Forest Credit Certificate (Certificado de Abono Forestal, CAF) of 1986 and the Forest Protection Certificate (Certificado para la Protección del Bosque, CPB) of 1995. One of the main reasons for establishing the PSA program was to reframe conservation subsidies as payments for services. It explicitly recognized four environmental services: mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, hydrological services, biodiversity protection, and provision of scenic beauty. During {{the early years of the}} PSA program from 2001 to 2006, it was funded by a World Bank loan and a grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) under the project name [...] "Ecomarkets." [...] From 2007 to 2014, the World Bank renewed its support for the program through a new project called [...] "Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management."

However, potentially the greatest threats to tropical biodiversity (synergistic interactions between climatic changes and human land use) remain understudied. Key concerns are that aridification could increase the accessibility of previously non-arable or remote lands, elevate fire impacts and exacerbate ecological effects of habitat disturbance. The growing climatic change literature often fails to appreciate that, in coming decades, climate land use interactions might be at least as important as abiotic changes per se for the fate of tropical biodiversity. In this review, we argue that protected area expansion along key ecological gradients, regulation of human-lit fires, strategic <b>forest</b> carbon <b>financing</b> and re-evaluations of agricultural and biofuel subsidies could ameliorate some of these synergistic threats...|$|R
40|$|Rural {{development}} strategies often neglected {{forests in}} the past, {{but in the last}} two decades the attitude of policy makers and the interests of public and private inves-tors have changed considerably. Although the forestry sector has inherent charac-teristics that increase the complexity of investments, <b>forest</b> <b>financing</b> has grown in importance and became a focal point for the implementation of rural development policies. More than 600 different major financial actors invest in forestry world-wide. They are conventionally distinguished as private, i. e. profit oriented inves-tors, or public, i. e. development oriented investors. As regards finance instruments in use, they could be distinguished as conventional (i. e. also utilized outside for-estry), or innovative ones (i. e. forestry-specific). According to UNEP figures, USD 64 billion have recently been invested in the forest sector every year, but global need for funding for sustainable forest management is estimated by the Col-laborative Partnership on Forestry to be between USD 70 and USD 160 billion per year. While direct public sector investments in forestry played a decisive role in the past, recent figures show that they are generally stable or declining, especially with regard to bilateral flows. At the same time private sector direct investments are on the increase, but they remain concentrated in a few countries. In the near future private forest investments will probably be mainly in planted forests. A consequent global shift in the industrial wood supply from temperate to tropical zones and from the Northern to Southern hemisphere is predicted by several stud-ies. Financial flows for investments in the timber sector will shift accordingly: this progress is not free of social and environmental risks. While the forestry sector presents new business opportunities for private operators, specific international and national policy tools for the governance of the changes are greatly needed...|$|R
