40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of changes in local blood flow on the recovery of a small, diffusible molecule (sodium fluorescein) from the extravascular tissue space of the skin, by microdialysis in vivo. Loss and recovery of fluorescein by linear microdialysis probes (5 -kDa molecular mass cutoff, 0. 2 mm diameter) inserted 1 mm apart in pairs, at three sites in the skin of the volar surface of the forearm of healthy volunteers, was measured under conditions of basal, reduced (noradrenaline, 0. 005 mg/ml), and increased (glyceryl trinitrate, patch) blood flow. Whereas loss of tracer from the <b>delivery</b> <b>probe</b> appeared unaffected by changes in local blood flow, retrieval of fluorescein by the second probe was directly related to blood flux, measured using scanning laser Doppler imaging. Steady-state recovery at vasoconstricted sites was 4. 0 ± 0. 7 µg · ml 1 compared with 1. 8 ± 0. 7 µg · ml 1 at control sites (p < 0. 001). Local vasodilatation reduced the retrieval of fluorescein by ~ 50 % to give a steady-state concentration of fluorescein in the dialysate at 40 to 50 min after the start of perfusion of 0. 9 ± 0. 3 µg · ml 1 (p = 0. 05). These studies in the skin are consistent with microdialysis theory. They suggest that clearance of solute by the blood will have a significant impact on microdialysis probe recovery and that, in the skin, the magnitude of this clearance is directly related to blood flow. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Laser Raman {{spectroscopy}} is an inelastic {{light scattering}} technique able to characterize molecules in aqueous environments. The {{purpose of this}} work {{is to develop a}} non-contact and non-invasive spectroscopic method to identify and eventually quantify the presence of medicines (e. g. antibiotics) and physiological substances (e. g. glucose) in the aqueous humor of the eye. Α new laser light <b>delivery</b> <b>probe</b> has been developed and adapted to a Raman spectroscopic system with the ability of favorable collection of the Raman light at 90 o scattering geometry while scanning the anterior chamber of the eye. The technique is applied both, to porcine eyes in-vitro, max. 24 hours after death and extraction, for ceftazidime, amphotericin B and glucose and to a commercially available artificial anterior chamber (AAC) fitted with corneas of porcine eyes for ceftazidime, amphotericin B, amikacin sulphate and ciprofloxacin. Finally, a PLS chemometric algorithm has been developed to predict the concentration of antibiotics in AAC. This special illumination design gives the opportunity of reducing the direct exposure of the basic cordial ocular tissues, like lens and retina, to the laser beam, {{while at the same time}} an optimum collection of scattered light is accomplished. Concentrations close to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) have been detected for antibiotics both in porcine eyes and AAC; the detection of glucose has been realized at concentrations close to the early pathological levels of patients with diabetes. Furthermore, the quantification of concentration of antibiotics in AAC is accomplished by a partial least-squares (PLS) chemometric regression algorithm and the RMS error of the validation procedure further emphasize the promising prospect of the application of the Raman spectroscopy to the Ophthalmology. ...|$|E

40|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} synthesized inside ethosomes, vesicles composed of phospholipid, ethanol and water, {{which could be}} very efficient not only in <b>delivery</b> <b>probes</b> to the skin but also as diagnostic and therapeutic multimodal agents. High efficiency encapsulation of gold nanoparticles is achieved by a simple strategy: the nanoparticles synthesis occurs simultaneously with the ethosomes formation, {{in the absence of}} any undesirable reducing agents. A three-dimensional reconstruction of a gold-embedded ethosome generated by cryoelectron tomography reveals that the gold particle is localized inside the lipid bilayer, leaving the ethosome surface and core free for further functionalization. The resulting gold nanoparticles are homogeneous in size and shape and, depending on synthesis temperature, the size ranges from 10 to 20 nm, as revealed by TEM. The ethosome-nanoparticles hybrids size has been investigated by means of dynamic light scattering and has been found to vary with temperature and gold salt concentration from 700 to 400 nm. Gold nanoparticles encapsulated ethosomes offer a versatile platform for the enhancement of pharmacological efficacy in transdermal and dermal delivery systems.

40|$|Applications for {{gene therapy}} that depend upon {{localization}} {{and control of}} gene expression are challenged by the mode for gene delivery. Viral vectors inherently suffer spread of the viral particles, as does liposome-based gene transfer. Similarly conventional “open-field” electroporation (OFE) achieves gene electrotransfer of naked plasmid DNA injected generally into the target tissue {{by means of a}} brief train of high-voltage electrical pulses creating a quasi-uniform electric field. The targeting of the gene transfer with OFE can be controlled to some extent by the placement of the electrodes in the tissue and the volume of injected DNA. In this chapter the application of “close-field” electroporation (CFE) is described, where a gene <b>delivery</b> <b>probe</b> is used for highly localized and controlled gene electrotransfer. CFE arose from use of cochlear implant electrode arrays, designed for spatially constrained electrical stimulation of the primary auditory neurons in the cochlea, where the array was reconfigured to provide electric field focusing that produced electric field strengths sufficient for gene delivery in the domain close to the bionic array using applied voltages considerably below that normally required for conventional electroporation. CFE {{has proved to be a}} highly robust and efficient means for targeting small tissue regions (hundreds of um 2 – to several mm 2) for efficient gene delivery, where the shape of the region of the tissue targeted for gene delivery can be controlled by varying the electric field shape around the bionic array and where near “dial-up” control of the delivery of the DNA payload can be achieved by varying the pulse parameters. The CFE gene electrotransfer platform has been successful in establishing a proof of principle for local neurotrophin gene therapy in the cochlea that regenerates primary auditory neuron dendrites in a deafened animal model, improving cochlear implant performance for hearing. The ability to control the distribution of the electric field around the bionic electrode array to deliver titrated local gene electrotransfer suggests that CFE could have broad application for gene therapy...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{vitreous}} consumes oxygen via an {{ascorbic acid}} reaction with molecular oxygen. The spatiotemporal characteristics of this reaction, specifically within the eye, {{are not fully}} understood. We investigated the spatiotemporal variation of vitreous oxygen consumption in porcine cadaver eyes. Methods: Whole porcine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse within 48 hours of enucleation. The native cornea and the lens were removed and replaced with a keratoprosthesis. Using a standard sclerotomy, a custom-made, semi-permeable oxygen delivery source was placed in two separate intravitreal locations (1 location per eye); the mid-vitreous (vitreous core) and posterior vitreous. A commercially made oxygen probe (Oxford Optronics) {{was used to measure}} the oxygen tension in various locations with respect to the oxygen <b>delivery</b> <b>probe.</b> For control experiments, the oxygen source was removed after the probe was positioned. After an hour in the dark, oxygen tension (pO_ 2) recordings were performed using a micromanipulator to retract the probe to desired distances (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 mm) away from the oxygen source. A two-sided, two sample t-test was conducted to statistically compare pO_ 2 recordings. Results: In the presence of an oxygen source, mid-vitreous pO_ 2 and posterior vitreous pO_ 2 measurements are higher across all distances as compared to the control pO_ 2 measurements (N= 4 for all groups). In the mid-vitreous experiments, there was a statistically significant difference between the oxygen source and control; (p< 0. 005) at all distances (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 mm). In the posterior vitreous experiments, there was a statistically significant difference between oxygen source and control at all distances as well; 0 mm (p< 0. 01), 1 mm (p= 0. 01), 2 mm (p< 0. 01), and 3 mm (p= 0. 018) distances. Oxygen tension recordings are higher in the mid-vitreous compared to the posterior vitreous at all distances. The mid-vitreous oxygen tension is significantly different from the posterior vitreous oxygen tension at 2 and 3 mm (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: Our data demonstrates that vitreous oxygen consumption is higher in the posterior vitreous compared to the mid vitreous. This may be important in understanding the role of vitreous cortex and vitreous core in oxygen homeostasis. These findings also have important implications in the modeling of oxygen consumption in the vitreous and eye...|$|E

Ts is a mammalian free cell membrane-penetrating peptide. This study aimed to introduce a novel approach to the design of a cancer-selective peptide {{on the basis of a}} membrane-penetrating peptide and to explore its potential as a carrier of medical substances. Experimental approach: Ts was linked with a αvβ 3 -binding peptide P 1 c to create a hybrid referred to as PTS. The hybrid was labeled with an FITC or Cy 5. 5 as an imaging indicator to evaluate its in vitro and in vivo bioactivity. Key results: Hemolysis tests proved that in comparison with Ts, PTS caused similar or even less leakage of human erythrocytes at concentrations of up to 1 mmol/L. Flow cytometry assay and confocal microscopy demonstrated the following. 1) P 1 c alone could target and mostly halt at the cancer cell membrane. 2) Ts alone could not bind to the membrane sufficiently. 3) P 1 c greatly enhanced the binding affinity of PTS with MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cells that upregulated αvβ 3. 4) Ts conferred PTS with the ability to traverse a cell membrane and thus facilitate the transmembrane <b>delivery</b> of imaging <b>probes.</b> In vivo near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging demonstrated that the imaging probes were rapidly concentrated in a MDA-MB- 231 tumor tissue within 1 h after intravenous injection.

It is the alterations in electrical, magnetic, structural, morphological, chemical, and physical properties of nanomaterials, which are comparable in size to naturally occurring biomolecules, that makes them particularly attractive for pioneering applications in technological and biological applications [1 – 4]. Nanomaterials comprised of ZnO have received considerable attention in recent years because of their potential use in electronic and industrial applications arising from their wide band gap (3.36 eV) semiconductor properties [3]. From a biological perspective, nanoscale ZnO materials are already being used in the cosmetic and sunscreen industry due to their transparency and ability to reflect, scatter, and absorb UV radiation, and as food additives [5, 6]. ZnO nanomaterials are also being considered for use in next-generation biological applications including antimicrobial agents, drug <b>delivery,</b> bioimaging <b>probes,</b> and cancer treatment [7 – 10]. Although bulk (micron-sized) ZnO is generally recognized as a GRAS substance by the FDA [5, 6], many benign materials can exhibit appreciable cellular toxicity when reduced to the nanoscale [11]. Recent toxicological studies using certain engineered nanoparticles (NPs) have confirmed the potentially harmful effects due to their high surface area, unique physiochemical properties, and increased reactivity of the material’s surface [11, 12]. This has led to the term, nanotoxicology, which describes the relationship between nanoparticle physiochemical properties and toxicological effects on living cells and biological systems.|$|R

This observation {{is in line with}} previous studies about the effect of SU 11248 on A 431 tumor vessels [15, 18]. In addition, immunohistology revealed strong pro-apoptotic effects of the antiangiogenic therapy on the tumor cells, especially within the almost devascularized center of the tumor, distant from mature and more functional blood vessels of the tumor periphery [15]. Contradictory to immunohistology, 2 D optical reflection imaging and especially 3 D fluorescence tomography showed strikingly lower concentrations of the NIRF probe Annexin Vivo in the treated tumors. These results pointed either to problems in <b>probe</b> <b>delivery.</b> On the other hand, since the data for both NIRF probes, Annexin Vivo and AngioSense, showed high standard deviations, we could not exclude problems in biodistribution. We therefore performed a second therapy study with a similar therapy design. Instead of performing NIRF annexin imaging, we used radiolabeled annexin (99 mTc-HYNIC-Annexin V) and quantitatively determined the tracer uptake in the tumor by gamma counting. Almost equal tumor-to-muscle ratios normalized to tissue weight were obtained in therapy and control tumors, whereas immunohistology again demonstrated a highly significant increase in apoptosis in the treated tumors. This demonstrated that also nuclear medicine measurement of apoptosis using radiolabeled annexin failed in detecting increased apoptosis after antiangiogenic therapy. In agreement with the first study, contrast-enhanced ultrasound and immunohistology revealed a significantly reduced vascularization in SU 11248 -treated tumors. Thus, we conclude that the breakdown of the vasculature in response to the antiangiogenic treatment strongly impairs the <b>delivery</b> of the <b>probe</b> to the tumor tissue, consequently resulting in a low probe accumulation despite the enhanced apoptosis. This hypothesis is supported {{by the fact that the}} apoptotic tumor cells are predominantly located in the center with only a few remaining vessels and are distant from SMA-positive, mature blood vessels at the tumor periphery. The remaining functionality of SMA-positive, mature blood vessels in A 431 tumors has been previously demonstrated by detecting blood flow within the mature vessels even after antiangiogenic treatment [15]. A 431 tumors generally have a low amount of mature vessels as shown for the untreated controls, demonstrating the high vulnerability of the vasculature towards the antiangiogenic therapy. In treated tumors, the number of mature vessels was even lower than in the controls. Our conclusion of the problems in <b>probe</b> <b>delivery</b> due to antiangiogenic therapy is further supported by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of treated mouse colon xenografts, showing a reduced vascular permeability and vessel density as early as 24 h after antiangiogenic treatment [26, 27]. Accumulation of probes or tracers in tissues with strongly reduced vascularization might be improved by using smaller molecules like short peptides instead of proteins since they would more easily penetrate and more easily be distributed in the tissue.|$|R
