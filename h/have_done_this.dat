The other personnel known to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this</b> are Marine Corporal Jason Dunham, Navy SEAL Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael A. Monsoor, Marine Corporal Kyle Carpenter, and Marine Sergeant Rafael Peralta. McGinnis was the fourth recipient of the Medal of Honor {{in the course of the}} Iraq War.|$|E
5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that {{had taken over the}} foundation during the ninth century. Ælfric is said to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this</b> on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E

5|$|Of the {{off-season}} storms that struck land, {{portions of the}} Caribbean were affected most. Hurricane Alice was the only of the cyclones to strike land as a hurricane, doing so to islands in the northern Lesser Antilles; it caused locally heavy rainfall and moderate damage. No hurricanes have ever made landfall in the United States during December, although at one point a storm in 1925 was believed to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this.</b> One century earlier, a hurricane formed in the western Caribbean and struck Florida on or before June 3, which was the earliest date for a United States hurricane landfall. However, there is an unofficial hurricane in 1863 that struck the Florida panhandle, killing 110 people. The deadliest official off-season storm was a tropical storm in May 1948, which killed 80 people in the Dominican Republic.|$|E

25|$|The crew of HMS Haslemere spotted Johnson's {{parachute}} {{coming down}} and saw her alive in the water, calling for help. Conditions were poor – there was a heavy sea and a strong tide, snow was falling and it was intensely cold. Lt Cmdr Walter Fletcher, the commander of Haslemere, dived into the water {{in an attempt to}} rescue Johnson. Fletcher failed in the attempt. As a result of the intense cold he died in hospital days later. In 2016, Alec Gill, a historian, claimed that the son of a crew member stated that Johnson had died because she was sucked into the blades of the ship's propellers; the crewman did not observe this to occur, but only supposed that it might <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> <b>This</b> claim has not been verified, as Johnson's body was never recovered.|$|E
25|$|Cards acquire RHP {{reliever}} John Axford. The Cardinals acquired Milwaukee Brewers closer John Axford, 30, on August 30, {{in exchange}} for a player to be named later. No cash changed hands, leaving the Cardinals to pay Axford the approximately $1 mil. remaining on his $5 mil. 2013 contract. He is eligible for arbitration after the season, and the Cardinals can either non-tender him after the season or work out a new contract for him. He has not saved a game in 2013, and has a 4.45 ERA in 62 games. This is the first deal between the Cardinals and Brewers in 10 years. This is the first deal the Cardinals <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this</b> season to add to the club, and needed to be done before the August 31 deadline so Axford could be on the postseason roster.|$|E
25|$|Ashwin is {{also the}} third Indian cricketer to be awarded the Man of the Match (MoM) on debut. Other Indians to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this</b> before him were Narendra Hirwani, Pravin Amre, R.P. Singh. Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan {{achieved}} this feat after Ashwin. Ashwin registered the second best bowling on debut by an Indian bowler with 9/128, behind Hirwani's 16-wicket world record debut performance. Ashwin became the fastest Indian to record 50 wickets in Test matches as he overhauled the milestone in his ninth game. He achieved it when he dismissed the England opener Nick Compton on 16 November 2012 during {{the second day of}} the first Test at Ahmedabad. The previous record holder was the legendary Anil Kumble, who had reached the milestone in his tenth Test. On 8 December 2012, Ashwin completed 500 runs in his 11th Test cricket match when batting against England scoring 91*. With this he shares the record of becoming the fastest player along with Australia's Jack Gregory and England's Ian Botham, who also took 11 Tests to reach the mark of completing the all-round double of 500 runs and 50 wickets. Incidentally, the quickest Indian to reach 500 runs and 50 wickets before Ashwin was Salim Durani who did so in his 14th Test.|$|E

25|$|On his Test match debut, Viswanath {{scored a}} century against Australia at Kanpur in 1969 in a drawn match. He also {{recorded}} a duck {{in the same}} game, one of only four batsmen to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this</b> in their first match. He scored 13 more centuries in his Test career {{and none of them}} came in a match that was lost. He tended to produce his best performances on difficult pitches and a number of his best innings were not centuries, but were crucial to the team's cause. Against Australia and the West Indies, both known for their strong pace attacks, he had a batting average of over 50. He was at his peak in the mid-1970s. Against the West Indies at Madras in 1974–75 he scored 97 not out {{out of a total of}} 190 against a bowling attack containing Andy Roberts. Despite not being a century, it was regarded as one of the finest performances by an Indian and it led to an Indian victory. The Wisden 100 ranked it the 38th best innings of all time, and the second best non-century. He had also scored a match-winning century in the previous Test at Calcutta, but despite a 95 in the final Test at Bombay the series was lost 3–2.|$|E

The album's liner notes have a dedication from Maxwell to his [...] "musze", stating [...] "I could never <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this</b> without you".|$|E
