We adopt an international Hotelling duopoly setup, where firms are located in two asymmetric countries. We find that, if the intensity of <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> is common knowledge for country governments, this setup delivers no need of accompanying trade policies in order to enforce trade liberalisation. In the opposite case, in which information is asymmetric, i. e., the small country's Government cannot observe the positive enviromental effects of its firm's exports to foreign consumers, we find that: (i) the Pareto optimum is always enforced, since the brown country always relaxes the distortionary trade policy, and (ii) cheating on the <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> allows the brown country's government to extract extra surplus from the green country. Allowing for trade in green technology delivers opposite conclusions: the externality is minimised and welfare is maximised in equilibrium if information is symmetric while trade liberalisation with asymmetric information always entails a second best outcome...|$|E

Within a multi-country model where energy is produced with mobile capital in green and dirty production, we investigate the countries' decentralized choice of emissions taxes and green energy subsidies. Without green subsidies, the emissions tax is set inefficiently low, since each country ignores the <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> in icted on other countries and since the emissions tax leads to a capital out ow to other countries. When the green subsidy is available, countries choose a positive subsidy rate since this reduces the overall distortion of the tax-subsidy system. In doing so, each country internalizes a larger part of the <b>environmental</b> <b>externality.</b> As consequence capital is relocated from the dirty into the clean sectors and reduces global pollution. Hence, the subsidy is not only bene cial for the country which imposes it but for all countries. renewable energy, capital mobility, green subsidy, emissions regulation...|$|E

40|$|Because of the {{long-term}} nature of the climate problem, technological advances are often seen as {{an important component of}} any solution. However, when considering the potential for technology to help solve the climate problem, two market failures exist which lead to underinvestment in climate-friendly R&D: environmental externalities and the public goods nature of new knowledge. As a result, government subsidies to climate-friendly R&D projects are often proposed as part of a policy solution. Using the ENTICE model, I analyze the effectiveness of such subsidies, both with and without other climate policies, such as a carbon tax. While R&D subsidies do lead to significant increases in climate-friendly R&D, this R&D has little impact on the climate itself. Subsidies address the problem of knowledge as a public good, but they do not address the <b>environmental</b> <b>externality,</b> and thus offer no additional incentive to adopt new technologies. Moreover, high opportunity costs to R&D limit the potential role that subsidies can play. While R&D subsidies can improve efficiency, policies that directly affect the <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> have a much larger impact on both atmospheric temperature and economic welfare. ...|$|E

However, most {{research has focused}} either on environmental services that agriculture provides as a distinct ecosystem or the negative environmental impacts that agriculture imposes. Therefore, {{there is a great}} need to re-evaluate the all-round environmental roles of agriculture, to optimize environmental performance of agriculture and non-trade concerns in World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. By valuing the <b>environmental</b> <b>externalities</b> of agriculture, this article aims to heighten awareness of the environmental roles of agriculture to stimulate its implication in agricultural policy-making. The study presents estimates of economic values of <b>environmental</b> <b>externalities</b> from rice-wheat farming system in Zhenjiang, in aspects of greenhouse gas emissions, non-point source pollution, carbon sequestration and water containing capacity. We provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, with each step including measurement of physical dimensions and monetary evaluation. The former is based on a large-scale literature review, which provided a vital foundation for the monetary valuation. The results reveal that the values of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural land, agricultural non-point source pollution, carbon sequestration by crop and soil, and the flood control function provided by agricultural land are estimated as: -Â US$ 3. 61 Â xÂ  107 Â a-Â  1, -Â US$ 4. 59 Â xÂ  106 Â a-Â  1, +Â US$ 2. 30 Â xÂ  109 Â a-Â  1 and +Â US$ 2. 21 Â xÂ  107 Â a-Â  1, respectively.

In the process of industrial relocation, <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> and social cost could occur due to market failure and government failure.

In this paper, we address it with a theoretical analysis and an empirical investigation on the relationship between China's industrial relocation in the early 1990 s and energy consumption which is the primary source of CO 2 emission, an <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> that causes increasing concerns. The macro-policy analysis suggests that there would be a positive link between China's industrial relocation in the early 1990 s and energy saving (and environmental externalities reduction). Using fixed-effect regression model and simulation method, we provide an empirical support to this argument. In order to further reduce environmental externalities and social cost in the process of industrial relocation, we provide policy suggestions as follows: First, strengthen the evaluation of environmental benefits/costs; Second, pay more attention to the coordinated social-{{economic development}}; Third, avoid long-lived investment in high-carbon infrastructure in areas with industries moved in; Fourth, address employment issue in the areas with industries moved out.

40|$|Consumers do not {{necessarily}} understand the economic trade-offs that determine the optimal level of pollution and the functioning of environmental policy instruments. When the optimal policy is implemented, market mechanisms ensure that consumption decisions are guided by correct price signals. However, green consumers may not simply react to these market signals but continue to adjust their willingness {{to pay for the}} products as pollution accumulates into the natural environment. The behaviour of green consumers then becomes a source of market failure. We consider a dynamic model of pollution control in which the environmental regulator anticipates consumers ’ lack of responsiveness to environmental policy implementation. In this context, a paternalist regulator will design its environmental policy so as to correct both the <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> problem and the behavioural market failure. By contrast, a populist regulator will correct the <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> problem only. We characterize and compare the tax/subsidy policies that would be chosen by both types of planners to regulate a polluting duopoly. The implementation of the populist policy may lead either to an excessive or an insufficient level of pollution accumulation. Furthermore, it may require to provide higher subsidies to the brown firm in the long-run. ...|$|E

In line with Lambertini (1997 a) we show that, as long as no trade policy is undertaken by the government of the larger country, trade liberalisation is not feasible since the latter always loses from opening to trade. A subsidy policy in favour of the firm producing the clean good is, on the contrary, shown to give both countries the right incentives to liberalize trade. Allowing for redistributive transfers between countries further extends the parametric range for which trade liberalisation is feasible under the subsidy scheme. The alternative situation, in which the green firm is based in the larger country, is also briefly sketched to find that free trade does give rise to a global welfare increment with no need of accompanying trade policies...|$|E

The evaluation exercise {{is based on the assumption}} that the agents in question form conjectural variations. A number of environments are encompassed within this classification and have received due attention in the literature. Each of these heterogeneous environments, however, possesses considerable analytical homogeneity and permit subscription to a general model treatment. These environments include <b>environmental</b> <b>externality,</b> oligopoly and the analysis of the private provision of public goods. We highlight the general analytical approach by focusing on this latter context, in which debate centers around four issues: the existence of free-riding, the extent to which contributions are matched equally across individuals, the nature of conjectures consistent with equilibrium, and the allocative inefficiency of alternative regimes. This paper resolves each of these issues, with the following conclusions: A consistent-conjectures equilibrium exists in the private provision of public goods. It is the monopolistic-conjectures equilibrium. Agents act identically, contributing positive amounts of the public good in an efficient allocation of resources. There is complete matching of contributions among agents, no free-riding, and the allocation is independent of the number of members within the community.
