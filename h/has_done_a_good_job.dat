Club gave a {{positive}} review, {{stating that the}} reveal was [...] "an effective narrative, and one which creates a [...] "satisfying" [...] resolution for the viewer {{as well as the}} character. Veronica Mars <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of subverting expectations on a regular basis, but it’s still a TV show, with requirements for satisfying resolutions. [...] Which is my roundabout way of saying that while I wasn’t surprised by the reveal that it was Duncan Kane, I was impressed by how well it worked up to that point. It had to be Duncan or someone totally irrelevant and shocking." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A+", its fourth such rating for the series, after [...] "An Echolls Family Christmas", [...] "Clash of the Tritons", and [...] "M.A.D.".|$|E
500|$|Margarita with a Straw premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, and {{was also}} {{screened}} at Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, BFI London Film Festival, 19th Busan International Film Festival, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.

While Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter made a detailed note of her [...] "bravura performance in both physical and emotional terms", NDTV film critic Saibal Chatterjee straightforwardly deemed her [...] "absolutely brilliant". Firstposts Deepanjana Pal ascribed her screen appeal to her lack of acting pretense, and wrote [...] " [...] <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of miming the physicality but what is truly remarkable {{is the lack of}} artifice in her expressions".

He gave Koechlin the highest praise writing that her performance would have attracted Academy Award notice in a major film studio production. The view was echoed by Variety critic Guy Lodge, who was particularly impressed by her range.
