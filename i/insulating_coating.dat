25|$|Electro-wetting display (EWD) {{is based}} on {{controlling}} {{the shape of a}} confined water/oil interface by an applied voltage. With no voltage applied, the (colored) oil forms a flat film between the water and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) <b>insulating</b> <b>coating</b> of an electrode, resulting in a colored pixel. When a voltage is applied between the electrode and the water, the interfacial tension between the water and the coating changes. As a result, the stacked state is no longer stable, causing the water to move the oil aside. This makes a partly transparent pixel, or, if a reflective white surface is under the switchable element, a white pixel. Because of the small pixel size, the user only experiences the average reflection, which provides a high-brightness, high-contrast switchable element.|$|E

Fully processed electrical steel is usually delivered with an <b>insulating</b> <b>coating,</b> full heat treatment, and defined magnetic properties, for applications where punching does not significantly degrade the electrical steel properties. Excessive bending, incorrect heat treatment, or even rough handling can adversely affect electrical steel's magnetic properties and may also increase noise due to magnetostriction.|$|E

This burr should be cleaned or reamed when cutting electrical conduit to prevent stripping of the <b>insulating</b> <b>coating</b> from the wires.

In terms of fur, however, desert animals have thick <b>insulating</b> <b>coats</b> that impede the conduction of heat towards the body. The coats are not uniformly distributed, but rather leave sparsely covered patches called [...] "thermal windows" [...] at the axilla, groin, scrotum, and mammary glands. Heat can be dissipated from thermal windows via convection and conduction.|$|R
50|$|Low-frequency {{inductors}} {{are often}} made with laminated cores to prevent eddy currents, using construction similar to transformers. The core {{is made of}} stacks of thin steel sheets or laminations oriented parallel to the field, with an <b>insulating</b> <b>coating</b> on the surface. The insulation prevents eddy currents between the sheets, so any remaining currents must be within the cross sectional area of the individual laminations, reducing {{the area of the}} loop and thus reducing the energy losses greatly. The laminations are made of low-coercivity silicon steel, to further reduce hysteresis losses.|$|E
5000|$|For example, in a chip-on-board {{assembly}} process, a {{silicon die}} {{is mounted on}} the board with an adhesive or a soldering process, then electrically connected by wire bonding, typically with [...]001-inch-diameter gold or aluminum wire. The chip and the wire are very delicate, so they're encapsulated in a version of conformal coating called [...] "glob top." [...] This prevents accidental contact from damaging the wires or the chip. Another use of conformal coating {{is to increase the}} voltage rating of a dense circuit assembly; an <b>insulating</b> <b>coating</b> can withstand a much stronger electric field than air, particularly at high altitude.|$|E
5000|$|Eddy-current losses - If {{the core}} is {{electrically}} conductive, the changing magnetic field induces circulating loops of current in it, called eddy currents, due to electromagnetic induction. [...] The loops flow {{perpendicular to the}} magnetic field axis. The energy of the currents is dissipated as heat in {{the resistance of the}} core material. The power loss is proportional to the area of the loops and inversely proportional to the resistivity of the core material. Eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core out of thin laminations which have an <b>insulating</b> <b>coating,</b> or alternatively, making the core of a magnetic material with high electrical resistance, like ferrite.|$|E

50|$|Distarterops, Scinderedens solungulus: a shellfish-eating, semiaquatic, walrus-like {{relative}} of predator rats. The distarterops has an <b>insulating</b> <b>coat</b> of hair matted into solid plates. It reaches lengths of about 4 meters. Its most unusual feature is its teeth, whereof the upper incisors form long, pointed tusks: a male's left tusk projects forward, while the right tusk points down {{and is used}} as a pick to remove shells from the sea bottom, whereas females' tusks both curve downwards. This asymmetry is also found in the limbs; the left front flipper only is equipped with a strong claw, which it uses to dislodge shells. It lives on the shellfish on shallower areas of the ocean bed. Distarterops are gregarious creatures and are often found resting on ice floes during the summer months, in small groups of both males and females.|$|R

50|$|Eddy currents: From Faraday's law of induction, the {{changing}} magnetic field induces circulating electric currents inside nearby conductors, called eddy currents. The energy in these currents is dissipated as {{heat in the}} electrical resistance of the conductor, so they are a cause of energy loss. Since the magnet's iron core is conductive, {{and most of the}} magnetic field is concentrated there, eddy currents in the core are the major problem. Eddy currents are closed loops of current that flow in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. The energy dissipated is proportional to the area enclosed by the loop. To prevent them, the cores of AC electromagnets are made of stacks of thin steel sheets, or laminations, oriented parallel to the magnetic field, with an <b>insulating</b> <b>coating</b> on the surface. The insulation layers prevent eddy current from flowing between the sheets. Any remaining eddy currents must flow within the cross section of each individual lamination, which reduces losses greatly. Another alternative is to use a ferrite core, which is a nonconductor.|$|E
5000|$|To {{prevent the}} high {{voltages}} {{generated in the}} coil from breaking down the thin insulation and arcing between the secondary wires, the secondary coil uses special construction {{so as to avoid}} having wires carrying large voltage differences lying next to each other. In one widely used technique, the secondary coil is wound in many thin flat pancake-shaped sections (called [...] "pies"), connected in series. [...] The primary coil is first wound on the iron core and insulated from the secondary with a thick paper or rubber coating. [...] Then each secondary subcoil is connected to the coil next to it and slid onto the iron core, insulated from adjoining coils with waxed cardboard disks. The voltage developed in each subcoil isn't large enough to jump between the wires in the subcoil. [...] Large voltages are only developed across many subcoils in series, which are too widely separated to arc over. To give the entire coil a final <b>insulating</b> <b>coating,</b> it is immersed in melted paraffin wax or rosin; the air evacuated to ensure there are no air bubbles left inside and the paraffin allowed to solidify, so the entire coil is encased in wax. To prevent eddy currents, which cause energy losses, the iron core is made of a bundle of parallel iron wires, individually coated with shellac to insulate them electrically. [...] The eddy currents, which flow in loops in the core perpendicular to the magnetic axis, are blocked by the layers of insulation. The ends of the insulated primary coil often protruded several inches from either end of the secondary coil, to prevent arcs from the secondary to the primary or the core.|$|E
