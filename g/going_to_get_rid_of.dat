25|$|On a Sunday {{morning in}} 1909, fourteen-year-old Celie – {{who has had}} one child by her father Alphonso and is now {{pregnant}} with her second – plays a clapping game with her younger sister Nettie. While attending services with {{the other members of}} their rural Georgia community, Celie goes into labor and is dragged out of the church as the congregation quietly looks on ("Huckleberry Pie/Mysterious Ways"). After Celie gives birth to a son, her father takes the child away and bluntly tells her he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> it like the last one. Celie quietly says goodbye to her newborn and asks God for a sign ("Somebody Gonna Love You").|$|E
500|$|The 1937–1938 film tie-in serial {{comic strip}} [...] "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" [...] written by Merrill De Maris, {{one of the}} writers of the film, is centred {{primarily}} around the relationship between Snow White and the Queen. It further explores {{the source of the}} Queen's descent into a murderous envy, as she learns that the Prince came to her castle seeking {{the most beautiful woman in}} all the world and is shocked when he says he meant Snow White. Like in the abandoned film concept, the Queen (here actually named Grimhilde) has the Prince arrested. In her Witch form, she later tells the captive Prince that she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> Snow White and make him hers, while the Prince is defiant and calls her a [...] "miserable hag". This scene is followed by his escape from prison, in much less dramatic circumstances than the film's drowning concept. The film was also adapted into an other comics including in 1969, 1983, and 1991.|$|E
500|$|In January 2016, Evancho {{appeared}} at the Mending Broken Hearts With Hope luncheon to benefit The Shelter for Abused Women & Children in Naples, Florida. She then released a single and video covering of Sam Smith's [...] "Writing's on the Wall" [...] and another single and video covering, Skylar Grey's [...] "Coming Home (Part II)". In April, Evancho sang the national anthem at the Pittsburgh Pirates' 2016 opening home game. She also released an original pop song by Peter Zizzo, [...] "Apocalypse". Billboard wrote that she [...] "has found a brand-new sound. The 16-year-old singer ... is taking a step outside the classical world that made her famous"; but Evancho told Billboard: [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> my classical voice, because that's my roots, that's what I love the most." [...] She also released a video of the song and performed it on the Today show and Live! with Kelly and Michael. A reviewer for The New Yorker, however, found the track [...] "cloying", writing that Evancho [...] "sounds unremarkable outside her genre." ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} part of the trial for Mendleson was her final speech in her own defence, which took a day and a half of court time. She urged the jury to understand her political work and lifestyle, which would help them see why the police should have planted guns and explosives on her. She noted that at the time of the Manchester bombing she had been living in Wivenhoe where doors were left open and people borrowed each other's magazines, and she had been able to produce unchallenged alibi witnesses to the fact that she was in Wivenhoe when the bomb was planted. Although she knew others in the case, she asserted that there was no evidence of any plots or conspiracies. Mendleson said that she understood the feelings behind those who would make bomb attacks on cabinet ministers but doing so [...] "isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the capitalist system, because there is always somebody to step into his place unless the situation and conditions are right". In conclusion she stressed that those in dock [...] "are working together for a happier and more peaceful world".|$|E
2500|$|On 28 June 2016, Farage made {{a speech}} in the European Parliament in which he claimed that a {{hypothetical}} failure for the EU to forge a trade deal with an exiting UK would [...] "be far worse for you {{than it would be}} for us", to heckling and laughing by Parliament members. He insulted his fellow MEPs, claiming that [...] "virtually none" [...] of them had ever had done [...] "a proper job" [...] in their lives. Media around the world covered Farage's speech, including his comment: [...] "... when I came here 17 years ago, and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me. Well I have to say, you're not laughing now are you?" [...] and his prediction that Britain will not be the only country to leave the EU. [...] In response, Guy Verhofstadt compared Farage's referendum posters with Nazi propaganda and credited the Brexit campaign with causing a multi-billion loss in the stock exchange. Explicitly addressing Farage, Verhofstadt added, [...] "... Ok. Let’s be positive. Finally, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the biggest waste in the budget of the (European) Union, that we have paid for 17 years, your salary." ...|$|E

ABSTRACT: There are many causes of WMSDs, and to prevent them, the whole work situation {{must be taken into}} consideration; it is therefore a difficult issue to handle. First, {{it is important to understand}} what is <b>going</b> on, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of any biases, to find out the facts. Then, it is necessary to address and evaluate the seriousness of the situation prevailing in the workplace. If the situation is acceptable, it may be sufficient to simply remain alert and ready to intervene at the slightest sign of deterioration. If, however, it becomes obvious that the situation is problematic, either because there are already signs of identified. This project demonstrates that there is ample room for ergonomic improvements in the lock industry. We need to continue to identify problems and, more importantly, implement solutions to reduce the risk of injuries in situations where we know problems exist...|$|R
