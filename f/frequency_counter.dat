50|$|<b>Frequency</b> <b>counters</b> {{designed}} for radio frequencies (RF) are also common and {{operate on the}} same principles as lower <b>frequency</b> <b>counters.</b> Often, they have more range before they overflow. For very high (microwave) frequencies, many designs use a high-speed prescaler to bring the signal frequency down {{to a point where}} normal digital circuitry can operate. The displays on such instruments take this into account so they still display the correct value. Microwave <b>frequency</b> <b>counters</b> can currently measure frequencies up to almost 56 GHz. Above these frequencies the signal to be measured is combined in a mixer with the signal from a local oscillator, producing a signal at the difference frequency, which is low enough to be measured directly.|$|R

50|$|I/O {{interfaces}} {{allow the}} user to send information to the <b>frequency</b> <b>counter</b> and receive information from the <b>frequency</b> <b>counter.</b> Commonly used interfaces include RS232, USB, GPIB and Ethernet. Besides sending measurement results, a counter can notify the user when user-defined measurement limits are exceeded. Common to many counters are the SCPI commands used to control them. A new development is built-in LAN-based control via Ethernet complete with GUI's. This allows one computer to control one or several instruments and eliminates the need to write SCPI commands.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 {{the company}} {{expanded}} its Test and Measurement product lines to include signal detection and measurement instruments. It now offers {{a wide range}} of measurement tools, such as Digital Multimeters, <b>Frequency</b> <b>Counters,</b> 300 MHz Oscilloscopes and Time Interval Counters.|$|R
40|$|Seven {{integrated}} circuits incorporated {{at very low}} cost into <b>frequency</b> <b>counters</b> and digital voltmeters performing a voltage-to-frequency conversion permit automatic range changing.

50|$|<b>Frequency</b> <b>counters</b> or high <b>frequency</b> {{heterodyne}} {{systems can}} be used. Here the unknown frequency is compared with harmonics of a known lower frequency by use of a low frequency generator, a harmonic generator and a mixer. Accuracy of the measurement {{is limited by the}} accuracy and stability of the reference source.|$|R
50|$|An early {{implementation}} of engineering notation {{in form of}} range selection and number display with SI prefixes {{was introduced in the}} computerized HP 5360A <b>frequency</b> <b>counter</b> by Hewlett-Packard in 1969.|$|E
50|$|Higher {{frequencies}} {{are usually}} {{measured with a}} <b>frequency</b> <b>counter.</b> This is an electronic instrument which measures the frequency of an applied repetitive electronic signal and displays the result in hertz on a digital display. It uses digital logic to {{count the number of}} cycles during a time interval established by a precision quartz time base. Cyclic processes that are not electrical in nature, such as the rotation rate of a shaft, mechanical vibrations, or sound waves, can be converted to a repetitive electronic signal by transducers and the signal applied to a <b>frequency</b> <b>counter.</b> Frequency counters can currently cover the range up to about 100 GHz. This represents the limit of direct counting methods; frequencies above this must be measured by indirect methods.|$|E
50|$|A <b>frequency</b> <b>counter</b> is an {{electronic}} instrument, or component of one, {{that is used}} for measuring frequency. Frequency counters usually measure the number of oscillations or pulses per second in a periodic electronic signal. Such an instrument is {{sometimes referred to as}} a cymometer, particularly one of Chinese manufacture.|$|E
50|$|Non-Linear Systems is an {{electronics}} manufacturing {{company based in}} San Diego, California. Non-Linear Systems was founded in 1952, by Andrew Kay, {{the inventor of the}} digital voltmeter. Later the company developed miniature digital voltmeters and <b>frequency</b> <b>counters.</b> During the early 1980s the company started Kaypro, which developed an early personal computer.|$|R
40|$|An {{electronic}} {{technique is}} described whereby the heterodyne mixing frequency of a pulsed LIDAR transmitter is {{displayed on a}} color-coded linear bar graph. The technique is of great utility for manually fine tuning the laser output frequency when the use of conventional <b>frequency</b> <b>counters</b> and spectrum analyzers is impractical in a rapidly firing system...|$|R
50|$|Atec {{was founded}} in 1953 as Accurate Instrument Co. and was officially {{incorporated}} {{in the state of}} Texas on July 13, 1956. Accurate Instrument Co. primarily manufactured instrumentation for the aviation industry. Some notable products included a standard day instrument (used to provide automated correlations to standard sea level atmospheric conditions), signal generators, <b>frequency</b> <b>counters,</b> oscillators, and pressure test sets.|$|R

50|$|Most labs {{have three}} {{calibration}} sections divided into K1/K8, K5/K6 and K3/K4 {{that specialize in}} like test equipment.For example the K3/K4 section would maintain <b>Frequency</b> <b>counter,</b> Oscilloscope, Synthesized Signal Generator and power sensor. While K1/K8 would maintain digital multimeter, high voltage probe and resistance standards. Lastly K5/K6 would deal with truck scales, pressure gauges, optics and micrometers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999 Voja Antonić {{created a}} logic analyzer, probe, serial {{interface}} receiver and <b>frequency</b> <b>counter</b> device based on Microchip Technology PIC16F84 microcontroller. It eventually became Microchip's [...] "application note 689" [...] (AN689) but was subsequently removed. Although {{the work was}} published, compensation for his efforts, Microchip in-circuit emulator [...] "MPLAB-ICE 1000" [...] was never sent to Mr. Antonić. Microchip claimed that it was prevented by ongoing sanctions against Yugoslavia.|$|E
50|$|The {{professional}} {{version of}} CircuitLogix (CircuitLogix Pro) includes over 10,000 device models, {{as well as}} 8 virtual instruments. It also includes 3DLab, which is a software product that combines an interactive 3-dimensional learning environment and electronic devices and tools to enhance the user's comprehension of electronics. 3DLab virtual components include batteries, switches, motors, lamps, resistors, inductors, capacitors and instruments including oscilloscopes, Signal generators, and <b>frequency</b> <b>counters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The phase {{transforms}} are all assembled from {{piecewise linear}} functions under binary logic control and shows characteristic sharp knees (and for some transforms, even sudden jumps) {{as they move}} from minimum to maximum, where the <b>frequency</b> <b>counter's</b> accumulator wraps around and starts over. The sharp knees are smoothened out by the roundness of the modulated sine wave and not too noticeable in the resulting signal.|$|R
2500|$|Burroughs {{even had}} another Haydu tube that could {{operate as a}} digital counter and {{directly}} drive a Nixie tube for display. This was called a [...] "Trochotron", in later form known as the [...] "Beam-X Switch" [...] counter tube; another name was [...] "magnetron beam-switching tube", referring to their similarity to a cavity magnetron. Trochotrons {{were used in the}} UNIVAC 1101 computer, as well as in clocks and <b>frequency</b> <b>counters.</b>|$|R
50|$|A young Steve Jobs, then age 12, called Hewlett (whose {{number was}} in the Phone book) and {{requested}} any available parts for a <b>frequency</b> <b>counter</b> he was building. Hewlett, impressed with Jobs' gumption, offered him a summer job assembling frequency counters. Jobs then considered HP {{one of the companies}} that he admired, regarding it among the handful of companies (Disney and Intel were the others) that were built “to last, not just to make money”.|$|E
5000|$|The {{accuracy}} of a <b>frequency</b> <b>counter</b> is strongly {{dependent on the}} stability of its timebase. A timebase is very delicate like the hands of a watch, and can be changed by movement, interference, or even drift due to age, meaning it might not [...] "tick" [...] correctly. This can make a frequency reading, when referenced to the timebase, seem higher or lower than the actual value. Highly accurate circuits are used to generate timebases for instrumentation purposes, usually using a quartz crystal oscillator within a sealed temperature-controlled chamber, known as an oven controlled crystal oscillator or crystal oven.|$|E
5000|$|A {{direct current}} flowing in a solenoid creates a strong {{magnetic}} field around a hydrogen-rich fluid (kerosene and decane are popular, and even {{water can be}} used), causing some of the protons to align themselves with that field. The current is then interrupted, and as protons realign themselves with the [...] magnetic field, they precess at a frequency that is directly proportional to the magnetic field. This produces a weak rotating magnetic field that is {{picked up by a}} (sometimes separate) inductor, amplified electronically, and fed to a digital <b>frequency</b> <b>counter</b> whose output is typically scaled and displayed directly as field strength or output as digital data.|$|E
50|$|The company {{produced}} electronic {{test and}} measurement equipment and systems, including automatic test equipment. It {{was known for}} its extensive range of signal generators, from audio up to microwave frequencies. It also made oscilloscopes, voltmeters, spectrum analysers, <b>frequency</b> <b>counters,</b> function generators, component (LCR) bridges, impedance analysers, power supplies, distortion analysers, moisture meters and logic analysers. The company operated an approved calibration and metrology laboratory for the electronics industry.|$|R
30|$|The {{amount of}} data {{generated}} in vehicular ad hoc networks is massive due to on-board monitoring of vehicles and relevant spatiotemporal data acquisition. The authors in [46] utilized sketching algorithm called count-min sketch algorithm to compress vehicular movement data and achieved compact communication. The algorithm maps <b>frequency</b> <b>counters</b> to compressed vectors using hash tables. Although {{the main focus of}} the proposed study is on privacy preservation, data reduction is also performed significantly.|$|R
25|$|Nixies {{were used}} as numeric {{displays}} in early digital voltmeters, multimeters, <b>frequency</b> <b>counters</b> and many other types of technical equipment. They also appeared in costly digital time displays used in research and military establishments, and in many early electronic desktop calculators, including the first: the Sumlock-Comptometer ANITA Mk VII of 1961 and even the first electronic telephone switchboards. Later alphanumeric versions in fourteen segment display format found use in airport arrival/departure signs and stock ticker displays. Some elevators used Nixies to display floor numbers.|$|R
