Objectives {{of the study were}} to evaluate the efficacy of contact herbicides for defoliation as a second application and evaluate any potential improvement in lint return (gin turnout), fiber quality and overall lint value. In 2002, Delta and Pine cultivar 458 BR was planted on 17 April. In 2004 and 2005 Delta and Pine cultivar 449 BR was planted on 13 May and 12 April respectively. In all years, plots were 13. 33 ft wide and 25 ft long and treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block with four replications. Irrigation was terminated at cutout (NAWF= 5) and defoliation treatments were initiated 22 days later. All plots received an initial defoliation treatment of thidiazuron plus diuron (Ginstar) at 8 oz/A. In 2002 and 2004, follow-up applications occurred seven days after initial defoliation, and included the following treatments: paraquat (Gramoxone Max) at 10. 7 oz/A plus nonionic surfactant at 0. 25 %v/v, flumiclorac (Resource) at 8 oz/A plus crop oil concentrate (COC) at 1 % v/v, pyraflufen (ET) at 1. 5 oz/A plus COC at 1 % v/v or carfentrazone (Aim) at 1. 0 oz/A plus COC at 1 % v/v. In 2005, <b>follow-up</b> <b>application</b> occurred eight days after initial defoliation and included the same treatments as 2002 and 2004 with the addition of fluthiacetmethyl (Blizzard) at 0. 5 oz/A plus COC at 1 % v/v and an adjustment of the Gramoxone Max rate to 20 oz/A.

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the 4 -year Dutch reimbursement application data, including the diagnostic, disease activity and response criteria that were applied for treatment of PsA with biologics. METHODS: All initial and <b>follow-up</b> <b>applications</b> for approval of treatment with biologics were included for investigation. Data were analysed descriptively with regard to application characteristics, patient characteristics and response to therapy. RESULTS: In the period studied, 3723 application forms of 1991 patients were received. This concerned 2118 initial treatment <b>applications</b> and 1605 <b>follow-up</b> <b>applications.</b> Of all initial treatment applications, 2003 (94. 6 %) were approved. The major part of all applications concerned requests for etanercept (59. 1 %), followed by adalimumab (38. 2 %). Patients were suffering from polyarthritis in most cases (63. 1 %). MTX was used by nearly all patients, but only 55. 8 % had used the required dosage of 25 mg/week. Approximately 79. 4 % of all patients met the response criteria after 3 months of treatment. The mean number of affected joints declined from 7. 7 at first application to 1. 4 at follow-up. The initial visual analogue scale (VAS) score indicated by patients decreased from 71. 2 to 24. 1 at follow-up. The VAS score indicated by physicians decreased from 66. 0 to 18. 4.

This paper concerns the relationship between new mobility products/services and the propensity to change travel behavior. In a survey of 501 respondents, the Theory of Planned Behavior was first applied to establish base case conditions for key variables. Respondents were exposed to seven possible improvements to transit services. A <b>follow-up</b> <b>application</b> of the theory was undertaken to look for shifts in key attitudes.

These three attitudinal categories were examined for four market segments for changed travel behavior. Research results suggest that new products and technologies dealing with a latent fear of being lost, abandoned or needing more information might contribute to an increased social acceptance of a lifestyle more dependent on transit and walking.

The objective {{of the present study was}} to examine the relationship of several CVD risk prediction scores with assessments of vascular function and morphology in patients with RA. METHODS: Framingham risk score, Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation for total cholesterol and ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein, as well as Reynolds Risk Score, and QRISK 2 were calculated in 201 RA patients (155 females, median (25 th to 75 th percentile) age: 61 (53 - 67)) who were examined at baseline (2006). The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) multiplication factor was also applied to the algorithms. At a 6 -year follow-up (2012) visit the patients underwent assessments of microvascular and macrovascular endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent function, along with assessment of carotid atherosclerosis.

Following the withdrawal of 2, 4, 5 -T, research on P. pallida resulted in revised recommendations for control of all Prosopis spp. in Queensland. Adoption of many of these recommendations for Quilpie mesquite control produced substandard results. Following a pilot trial, a shade-house experiment was conducted to determine the differences in susceptibility of two species of mesquite, P. velutina and P. pallida, to commonly available herbicides. It was hypothesized that P. velutina was less susceptible than P. pallida, based upon claims that the registered chemical recommendations for Prosopis spp. were not sufficiently effective on P. velutina. Nine foliar herbicide treatments were applied to potted shade-house plants. Treatment effects indicated differing susceptibility between the two species. P. velutina consistently showed less response to metsulfuron, fl uroxypyr, 2, 4 -D/picloram and triclopyr/picloram, compared to the glyphosate formulations, where negligible differences occurred between the two species. The response to glyphosate was poor at all rates in this experiment.

A single centre prospective analysis of adults post atrial redirection surgery (Mustard operation) for dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) presenting with systemic right ventricular (sRV) dysfunction and at risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). All patients (mean age 25 years, range 18 - 35) with varying functional disability{New York Heart Association (NYHA) II-III} receiving ICDs ± concomitant CRT were evaluated.

In the distribution of orbital periods, P, our analysis revealed a narrow subfamily of exoplanets within the broad family of "warm jupiters", or massive giants with P≳ 300 d, which are often deemed to be related with the iceline accumulation in a protoplanetary disk. We detected a p. d. f. pattern that represents an upturn followed by an overshooting peak spanning P∼ 300 - 600 d, right beyond the "period valley". It is separated from the other planets by p. d. f. concavities from both sides. It has at least two-sigma significance.

The NAC camera of the OSIRIS imaging system allowed to map the nucleus surface acquiring images with different filters in the visible wavelength range. Here we study the spectrophotometric behaviour of the nucleus by a multivariate statistical analysis, aiming to distinguish homogeneous groups and to constrain the bulk composition. We applied the G-mode clustering algorithm to 16 OSIRIS data cubes acquired on 5 - 6 August 2014 (mostly covering the northern hemisphere) and 2 May 2015 (mostly covering the southern hemisphere), selected to have complete coverage of the comet’s surface with similar observing conditions. We found four similar homogeneous groups for each of the analysed cubes. The first group corresponds to the average spectrophotometric behaviour of the nucleus. The second (spectrally redder) and the third (spectrally bluer) groups are found in regions that were already found to deviate from the average terrain of the comet by previous studies. A fourth group (characterised by enhancements of the flux at 700 - 750 nm and 989 nm, possibly due to H 2 O + and/or NH 2 emissions) seems connected with the cometary activity rather than with the bulk composition.

Similarly, observed breast cancers in 640 women were compared to retrospective predictions of breast cancer incidence. The ratios of observed to expected number of BRCA 1 -, BRCA 2 - and BRCA(1 or 2) mutations were 1. 43 (95 % CI 1. 05 – 1. 90), 0. 63 (95 % CI 0. 34 – 1. 08), and 1. 12 (95 % CI 0. 86 – 1. 44), showing a significant underestimation of BRCA 1 mutations. Discrimination between carriers and non-carriers as measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0. 83 (95 % CI 0. 76 – 0. 88). The ratio of observed to expected number of invasive breast cancers was 1. 41 (0. 91 – 2. 08). The corresponding area under the ROC curve for prediction of invasive breast cancer at individual level was 0. 62 (95 % CI 0. 52 – 0. 73). In conclusion, the BOADICEA model can predict the total prevalence of BRCA(1 or 2) mutations and the incidence of invasive breast cancers.

The interdisciplinary cooperation is an integral feature of the subprojects, which allows for the identification of measures and policies to reduce of the economic, ecological, and social consequences from flood events and is also of great importance for <b>follow-up</b> <b>applications</b> and the development of new methods that build on project house water research. Interdisciplinary collaboration of researchers to address a mutual research question is not a new concept, but it is unfortunately not always utilized. To overcome challenges of interdisciplinary research (i.e., lack of historical interdisciplinary cooperation, extra time requirements, differences in methodologies; [51]), the concepts, themes, questions, and research designs addressed in this research were mutually developed and are conducted by researchers from multiple disciplines. In addition, regular communication and frequent coordination of team members occur throughout the project, and ultimately the results and knowledge produced from this collaboration will provide feedback and the building blocks for future interdisciplinary research questions. The long-term goal of project house water is to continue to foster high-quality research in the fields of water research and flood-risk assessments, with the potential for collaboration, not only within the RWTH Aachen University but also with the numerous national and international colleagues in various academia, government, and industrial institutes. This work has been and, will continue to be, promoted at local, national, and international platforms to attract and further expand upon the existing research and scientific network of flood-related risk assessment. With promotion of this project house water research network early on, we hope to create a dialog with other researchers in the scientific community, who may be conducting similar works and to increase communication so that complementary investigations and research can be fostered to broaden the research network and efficiency of data output and sharing of data.|$|R

"May 2012 "One weed that is of concern in Missouri pastures that can be detrimental is Northern dewberry (Rubus flagellaris Willd.). This weed can be detrimental due its production of spines which can injure grazing animals and also humans. Results from our study show that herbicide applications made in the fall that contain metsulfuron will provide approximately 50 % control of this weed, but where severe infestations exist a <b>follow-up</b> <b>application</b> will be required. Tall fescue can also be detrimental to the health of grazing animals. It can contain a fungus known as ergovaline which is in its highest concentration in tall fescue seedheads. Applying herbicides at certain growth stages can reduce tall fescue seedhead density. Applications of metsulfuron-containing herbicides at the boot stage of growth reduced tall fescue seedhead density the most compared to vegetative stage applications of these same herbicides. The distribution of cattle grazing in mixed tall fescue and legume pastures is also an important aspect of pasture management. Overgrazing of certain areas in pastures can cause an increase in weed growth and also reduce the growth of desirable forage. However, many producers are skeptical of treating pastures with broadcast herbicide applications as almost all herbicides available for broadleaf weed control in a pasture setting will eliminate other desirable forage species such as clover. Through this research, it was determined that even with the elimination of legumes, cattle grazing distribution can be increased in herbicide-treated pastures compared to non-treated areas within the same pasture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effectiveness of integrating the use of cell-phones into a routine malaria prevention and control programme, to improve the management of malaria cases among an under-served population in a border area. The module for disease and treatment monitoring of malaria (DTMM) consisted of case investigation and case follow-up for treatment compliance and patients' symptoms. Methods The module combining web-based and mobile technologies was developed as a proof of concept, in an attempt to replace the existing manual, paper-based activities that malaria staff used in treating and caring for malaria patients in the villages for which they were responsible. After a patient was detected and registered onto the system, case-investigation and treatment details were recorded into the malaria database. A follow-up schedule was generated, and the patient's status was updated when the malaria staff conducted their routine home visits, using mobile phones loaded with the <b>follow-up</b> <b>application</b> module. The module also generated text and graph messages for a summary of malaria cases and basic statistics, and automatically fed to predetermined malaria personnel for situation analysis. Following standard public-health practices, access to the patient database was strictly limited to authorized personnel in charge of patient case management. Results The DTMM module was developed and implemented at the trial site in late November 2008, and was fully functioning in 2009. The system captured 534 malaria patients in 2009. Compared to paper-based data in 2004 - 2008, the mobile-phone-based case follow-up rates by malaria staff improved significantly. The follow-up rates for both Thai and migrant patients were about 94 - 99 % on Day 7 (Plasmodium falciparum) and Day 14 (Plasmodium vivax) and maintained at 84 - 93 % on Day 90. Adherence to anti-malarial drug therapy, based on self-reporting, showed high completion rate for P. falciparum -infected cases, but lower rate for P. vivax cases. Patients' symptoms were captured onto the mobile phone during each follow-up visit, either during the home visit or at Malaria Clinic; most patients had headache, muscle pain, and fatigue, and some had fever within the first follow-up day (day 7 / 14) after the first anti-malarial drug dose. Conclusions The module was successfully integrated and functioned as part of the malaria prevention and control programme. Despite the bias inherent in sensitizing malaria workers to perform active case follow-up using the mobile device, the study proved for its feasibility and the extent to which community healthcare personnel in the low resource settings could potentially utilize it efficiently to perform routine duties, even in remote areas. The DTMM has been modified and is currently functioning in seven provinces in a project supported by the WHO and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to contain multi-drug resistant malaria on the Thai-Cambodian border. </p...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{potential}} impact of conventional chemical pesticides on human health and on the environment, governments worldwide are developing policies to reduce the use of these pesticides. Instruments like the EU directive 91 / 414 /EEC, have resulted in the withdrawal of many active ingredients from the market. Furthermore, the new EU directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable use of pesticides states that non-chemical methods should be given priority wherever possible. To improve the sustainability of agriculture and to avoid resistance development against the receding number of active ingredients remaining on the market, biological alternatives for conventional chemical pesticides are much sought after and even urgently needed. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) are one of those alternatives. They are used for the biological control of an increasing number of insect pests. These bio-insecticides are exceptionally safe for farmers, farm workers, for consumers and for the environment. However, they may have lower efficacy than conventional chemical pesticides. Nonetheless, EPN are equivalent to or even better than conventional chemical insecticides in controlling a number of commercially important pests (e. g., against black vine weevil, citrus root weevil, cranberry girdler, hunting billbug and western corn rootworm). Poor efficacy against other pests can be the result of inappropriate application methods, the use of poor quality products or suboptimal application conditions. This work focused on optimizing the application of EPN in field vegetables. The general aim of this work was to test and, where possible, to improve the control potential of EPN against three difficult to reach pests, described in detail in chapter 1, viz. : the leaf-bound cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) in cauliflower, the soil-bound cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) in cauliflower and the cryptic onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) in leek. Depending on the target pest, the experiments described in chapters 2 to 5 examined the effect of (1) adding adjuvants to the spray suspension, (2) altering the application rate of the EPN and (3) adapting the application technique and/or (4) the timing of the application(s). Chapter 2 focused on improving the formulation and application of EPN on leaves using laboratory tests with special attention to one specific pest: the cabbage moth. Suitable adjuvants for EPN spray applications were selected based on the absence of toxic or immobilizing effects on two EPN species: Steinernema feltiae and S. carpocapsae. The selected humectants and dispersants were further screened for their effects on the sedimentation of these EPN species in a tank suspension. Next, the effect of three suitable surfactants and a humectant and the effect of nozzle size on the deposition of S. carpocapsae on hydrophobic cauliflower leaves was investigated. Subsequently, a laboratory experiment verified whether brewer’s yeast extract can be used as an attractant for the cabbage moth larvae, and whether it improves the mortality caused by EPN to cabbage moth larvae. Finally, the effect of the most suitable surfactant and humectant, selected from the deposition test, on the longevity and on the infectivity of S. carpocapsae, is presented. These experiments have shown that all selected alcohol ethoxylates (Synperonic 91 / 5, Synperonic 91 / 6, Synperonic 10 / 6 and Atplus 245) and the selected alkylpolysaccharide (AL- 2575) immobilized both S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae when mixed in the spray suspension. Xanthan gum remains the best sedimentation-retarding agent. An ISO 02 standard flat fan nozzle can clog when spraying S. carpocapsae. An ISO 04 standard flat fan nozzle provides a higher relative deposition of different S. carpocapsae-adjuvant suspensions on cauliflower leaves than the bigger ISO 08 standard flat fan nozzle. Three spreading agents (Silwet L- 77, SB Plant Invigorator and Addit) roughly doubled the relative EPN deposition with both the ISO 04 and the ISO 08 nozzle when added to the EPN suspension. Addition of xanthan gum did not significantly increase deposition any further. Addition of yeast extract to a foliar spray containing S. carpocapsae significantly increased mortality of the cabbage moth and decreased the amount of leaf damage caused by these caterpillars. And finally, it was shown that adding Addit and xanthan gum to a spray suspension containing S. carpocapsae prolongs the survival of EPN on leaves, and that these adjuvants can cause mortality in larvae of Galleria mellonella. It was however deemed unlikely, and proven in a field test (chapter 3), that Addit and xanthan gum at the used concentrations, would {{have a significant effect on}} insect plagues in field conditions. The field experiments described in chapter 3 implemented the results of chapter 2 and aimed to optimize the control of cabbage moth with S. carpocapsae. A spray application tools test, was performed to select a spray application technique that leads to a maximum of spray coverage on specific parts of the cauliflower plant. The targeted spraying areas were: (1) the central part of the plant, where the cabbage moth larvae can cause direct economic damage to the cauliflower head, and (2) the underside of the leaves, where the young larvae hide during the day and feed during the night. The test showed that two spray boom configurations with vertical extensions in the crop covered the lower side of the outer leaves very well, while also securing statistically equal coverage of the underside of the centre leaves, when compared to all other configurations. Therefore, one of these configurations, a spray boom configuration with TeeJet TP 80 04 EVS nozzles mounted on the horizontal spray boom and TeeJet UB 85 04 nozzles mounted 38 cm long vertical extensions, was selected for the field trial with S. carpocapsae. An adjuvant trial, determined whether S. carpocapsae, applied in the field with this technique, could effectively reduce the cabbage moth numbers in a cauliflower crop and/or the damage to this crop. It also tested if these parameters could be further reduced by adding yeast extract and/or Addit and xanthan gum to the tank suspension. An application rate trial and an application technique trial, were set up (1) to test the effect of different application rates of EPN on cabbage moth control and (2) to confirm if the application technique selected in the spray application tools test was indeed better suited than a standard broadcast spray application, for controlling the cabbage moth. In the adjuvant trial, the numbers of damaged cabbage heads clearly demonstrate a protective effect of spraying with a suspension of S. carpocapsae, when combined with Addit and xanthan gum. It was noticeable that Bt applications outperformed all other treatments, although the difference was not always significant. Based on these results, EPN might provide an extra control option against the cabbage moth, if the efficacy of EPN treatments can be further enhanced. Similar to the adjuvant trial, the numbers of cabbage moth larvae were highly variable between individual plants in both the application rate trial and the application technique trial, making it difficult to distinguish statistical differences between the mean number of caterpillars per plant. However, leaf damage measurements and the number of infected plants proved to be much less variable and thus much more reliable than counting numbers of caterpillars for assessing control by S. carpocapsae and Bt treatments in both trials. Only the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom effectively stopped damage development caused by the cabbage moth. Furthermore, the plots that received Bt with the adapted spray boom were the only plots that contained significantly less infected plants than the control plots. The protection against sunlight on the underside of leaves, together with better placement of the Bt spray may explain the better control of the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom compared with the regular spray boom. This chapter shows that there is much room for improvement in the foliar application of EPN against cabbage moth. Control results were probably largely dependent on the temperature. More cold-tolerant species, strains or breeding products of EPN should be searched for, so that they can be used against the cabbage moth, before any conclusions can be drawn on the optimal application rate of the EPN. The deposition measurements in all trials suffered from high variability. This was most probably caused by the plant architecture of cauliflower: due to the overlap of leaves, some areas of the plant are difficult to spray. This variability is a major concern for biocontrol agents like Bt and EPN, since areas that are not sprayed, are not protected against the targeted pest. When a low temperature active EPN species/strain/breeding product, efficacious against the cabbage moth, becomes available, then EPN applications might be fitted into biological control schemes to prevent development of resistance of cabbage moth against Bt. This is of major importance, since cabbage moth already seems to possess some innate resistance against Bt products. Chapter 4 presents three field tests with applications of IJ of S. feltiae against cabbage root fly in cauliflower. These tests focused on finding an optimal application rate (200, 000 IJ/plant vs. 50, 000 IJ/plant), a suitable application technique (plant tray spraying vs. drench application) and a good timing of the application (application at planting vs. application one week after planting vs. application two weeks after planting, with or without one or two follow-up treatment(s)). The results demonstrated that a plant tray spray with S. feltiae is superior to a drench application in controlling cabbage root fly in cauliflower. Plant tray sprayings with S. feltiae can reduce the percentage of dead plants compared with the non-treated control. The lack of an application rate-effect relationship suggests that it might be possible to further reduce the applied rate of S. feltiae without causing a significant reduction in control. Numbers of cabbage maggots around the plant roots can be temporarily reduced by plant tray sprays with a rate of 200, 000 IJ S. feltiae per cauliflower plant. Mortality results of bait tests with wax moth larvae on soil samples taken from around the cauliflower plants, showed that IJ of S. feltiae, applied as a plant tray spray, take one to two weeks to spread into the soil around the roots of cauliflower. These bait tests also showed that the most effective period of IJ of S. feltiae in the soil is limited up to five weeks, which warrants a follow-up treatment. Further research should examine whether the application rate of IJ of S. feltiae in a plant tray spray can be lowered, while maintaining a good control, and whether a <b>follow-up</b> <b>application</b> of S. feltiae, applied three to five weeks after planting with a better suited technique (e. g., injection), would further improve control of cabbage root fly. Chapter 5 presents two field trials in leek set up to determine and, if possible, to improve the effect of spray applications with S. feltiae against onion thrips in leek. The first trial was carried out on an organic farm and focused on selecting a suitable spray application technique and on testing the effect of an attractant on thrips control. The second trial focused on incorporating spray applications of EPN in a conventional insecticide scheme, and on the effect of mixing the surfactant Addit in the spray suspension on the control of onion thrips. The results show that the selected commercial strain of S. feltiae was not effective against the foliar inhabiting life stages of onion thrips in leek. Mixing a thrips attractant in the spray suspension and spraying with adapted spray equipment (band application and row application) did not improve the efficacy. Compared with the traditional spray boom technique, the row application technique ensured a more even EPN deposition on both the upper side and underside of both old and new leek leaves. This technique offers good potential for improving the applications of fungicides and of contact insecticides in leek. The general discussion in chapter 6 links the obtained results, and suggests directions for future research. The described experimental work with EPN against the cabbage moth, cabbage root fly and onion thrips showed that significant control of the first two pests is certainly possible in outdoor vegetables, but it also showed that there’s still a long way to go before EPN will be applied commercially against these pests in outdoor vegetables. Efficient control of insect pests with EPN requires a perfect match between several factors: the EPN species/strain/breeding product, the pest, the crop, the application (in terms of technique, formulation and application rate) and the environmental conditions. Matching these factors requires the screening and breeding of much more EPN species/strains for different properties (e. g., pathogenicity, temperature tolerance, mobility, drought resistance). In the short term, research on EPN applications against greenhouse pests seems to be the most promising area of research in temperate climates. Only when the prices for EPN drop due to more widespread adoption and when new EPN species/strains/breeding products and application techniques become available, will outdoor applications of EPN become commercially viable. Because pest control with EPN is obviously not a one-size fits-all solution, farmers will need appropriate knowledge to obtain successful pest control with EPN. Moreover, the upcoming EU obligation for farmers to use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) methods to protect their crops will further increase the demand for knowledge on IPM methods. Governmental, NGO and corporate advisory networks will need to be strengthened in order to fulfil this demand and to keep European crops healthy...|$|E

Plasmids pMind, pMV 261 and pMY 769 can carry the DNA fragment into cell, but the gene dosage cannot be quantified as these plasmids cannot integrate into the genome or another {{copy of the}} gene exists in the host genome and cannot be controlled by the operon of the plasmid. Plasmid pAZI 9479, a suicide plasmid for mycobacteria, can replace the promoter of the target gene with the ptr promoter through homologous recombination. However the mutant strain is not stable and can reverse to the wild type. Plasmid pNIL-pGOAL can knockout a target gene through double homologous recombination. However, in our hands, knockout strains of the essential genes {{could not be obtained}} and the target genes were cutoff so we could only study at the deficiency conditions. Inducible systems used in mycobacteria are also problematic. Currently, the mainly reported systems contain: acetamidase inducible system, pristinamycin inducible system, IPTG inducible system, nitrilases inducible system, theophylline riboswitch system and tetracycline inducible system. The acetamide-inducible system is the earliest mycobacterial inducible system described, which is used for over-expression, but the basal activity of promoter is high and prone to recombination (Parish et al. 1997; Brown and Parish 2006). Pristinamycin inducible system, IPTG inducible system are also successfully developed for gene regulation in mycobacteria (Forti et al. 2009; Ravishankar et al. 2015). IPTG inducible system is more frequently used in E. coli expression and <b>follow-up</b> <b>applications</b> in mycobacterium are limited. There are also references about nitrilases inducible system and theophylline riboswitch system (Pandey 2009; Seeliger et al. 2012). Tetracycline inducible system is the most widely used and has been validated that they can be used to regulate gene expression in animal models of infection (Carroll et al. 2005; Ehrt et al. 2005 a, b; Hernandez-Abanto et al. 2006). Considering all the above, we endeavoured to design a new plasmid containing tetracycline inducible system with the following advantageous characteristics that allow the researcher to: (i) construct a stable mutant strain; (ii) control gene expression quantitatively through the promoter of the plasmid.|$|R
