5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army with which <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> completely subjugate Greece. However, he died {{before the invasion}} could begin. The throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I, who quickly resumed the preparations for the invasion of Greece, including building two pontoon bridges across the Hellespont. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water {{as a gesture of}} their submission, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta (both of whom were at open war with Persia). Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed (hereafter referred to as 'the Allies'). This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.|$|E

Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and {{the throne of}} Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece. Since {{this was to be}} a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription. Xerxes decided that the Hellespont would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state. By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges.|$|E
5|$|In the meanwhile, Darius began {{raising a}} huge new army with which <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> {{completely}} subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.

Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece. The epic second Persian invasion of Greece finally began in 480 BC, and the Persians met with initial success at the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium. However, defeat at the Battle of Salamis would be the {{turning point in the}} campaign, and the next year the expedition was ended by the decisive Greek victory at the Battle of Plataea.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians {{and their}} allies chose a {{location}} for the battle, with marshes and mountainous terrain, that prevented the Persian cavalry from joining the main Persian army. Miltiades, the Athenian general, ordered a general attack against the Persian infantry-bowmen. He reinforced his flanks, luring the Persians' best fighters into his center. The inward wheeling flanks enveloped the Persians, routing them. The Persian army broke in panic towards their ships, and large numbers were slaughtered. The defeat at Marathon {{marked the end of}} the first Persian invasion of Greece, and the Persian force retreated to Asia. Darius then began raising a huge new army with which <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. After Darius died, his son Xerxes I restarted the preparations for a second invasion of Greece, which finally began in 480 BC.|$|E

By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army which Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges. According to Herodotus, Xerxes' army was so large that, upon arriving at the banks of the Echeidorus River, his soldiers proceeded to drink it dry. In the face of such imposing numbers, many Greek cities capitulated to the Persian demand for a tribute of earth and water.|$|E
25|$|On 11 December, Ardzinba {{declared}} {{that while the}} power-sharing agreement that resolved the 2004 post-election crisis had meant {{to bring an end}} to the division in the Abkhazian society, it had in fact failed to do so, and that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> correct that. Ardzinba also spoke out against the size of the bureaucracy, lamenting the duplication of functions.|$|E

25|$|In 1865, Whymper, {{weary of}} the defeats he had {{sustained}} on the south-west ridge, tried a new way. The stratification of the rocks on the east face seemed to him favourable, and the slope not excessive. His plan of attack was complicated: a huge rock couloir, the base of which lies on the Italian side below the Breuiljoch, on the little Matterhorn glacier, would be ascended to a point {{high up on the}} Furggen ridge; from there, traversing the east face of the mountain, <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> reach the Hörnli (north-east) ridge and follow it to the summit. However, when this route was attempted, the mountain discharged an avalanche of stone upon the climbers, and the ascent failed. His guides refused to make any further attempts by this route.|$|E
25|$|King Frederick's broad {{strategy}} {{had three}} parts. First, <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> seize Saxony and eliminate it {{as a threat}} to Prussia, then use the Saxon army and treasury to bolster the Prussian war effort. Second, he would advance from Saxony into Bohemia, where he might set up winter quarters at Austria's expense. Third, he would invade Moravia from Silesia, seize the fortress at Olmütz, and advance on Vienna to force an end to the war. To begin, Frederick divided his army in three: he placed a small force under Field Marshal Hans von Lehwaldt in East Prussia to guard against any Russian invasion from the east; he stationed Field Marshal Count Kurt von Schwerin in Silesia with 25,000 soldiers to deter incursions from Moravia and Hungary; finally, he personally led the main Prussian army into Saxony.|$|E
500|$|Asimov {{remained}} {{grateful for}} Campbell's early friendship and support. He dedicated The Early Asimov (1972) to him, and concluded it {{by stating that}} [...] "There is no way at all to express how much <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> me {{and how much he}} did for me except, perhaps, to write this book evoking, once more, those days of a quarter century ago".|$|E

500|$|After {{the seven}} {{passengers}} and three crew members boarded, {{the plane was}} cleared for takeoff on time at 5:54p.m. (16:54 UTC). The aircraft departed Runway 28 heading west. From takeoff, the plane climbed normally. But after [...] the plane suddenly started to lose altitude and turn to the right instead of following the approved flight path to the left. When air traffic controllers asked the pilot if <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> turn right, they were answered with [...] "Stand by," [...] followed by a loss of radio contact.|$|E
500|$|Politically, the {{new king}} {{took steps to}} {{conclude}} the protracted constitutional deliberations of the Assembly. On 19 October 1864, he sent the Assembly a demand, countersigned by Constantine Kanaris, explaining that he had accepted the crown on the understanding that a new constitution would be finalized, and {{that if it was}} not he would feel himself at [...] "perfect liberty to adopt such measures as the disappointment of my hopes may suggest". It was unclear from the wording whether <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> return to Denmark or impose a constitution, but as either event was undesirable the Assembly soon came to an agreement.|$|E

500|$|Chadwick {{chose to}} attend Victoria University of Manchester, which he entered in 1908. <b>He</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> study maths, but {{enrolled}} in physics by mistake. Like most students, he lived at home, walking the [...] {{to the university}} and back each day. At {{the end of his}} first year, he was awarded a Heginbottom Scholarship to study physics. The physics department was headed by Ernest Rutherford, who assigned research projects to final-year students, and he instructed Chadwick to devise a means of comparing the amount of radioactive energy of two different sources. The idea was that they could be measured in terms of the activity of [...] of radium, a unit of measurement which would become known as the curie. Rutherford's suggested approach was unworkable—something Chadwick knew but was afraid to tell Rutherford—so Chadwick pressed on, and eventually devised the required method. The results became Chadwick's first paper, which, co-authored with Rutherford, was published in 1912. He graduated with first class honours in 1911.|$|E
500|$|Speaking for the government, Edward Coke {{accused him}} of {{involvement}} in every treason since 1586, the year he returned to England. [...] According to Coke, the provincial superior {{was involved in the}} Main and Bye Plots of 1603. [...] He had sent Edmund Baynham to Rome to gain papal approval for the 1605 plot, and while at Coughton in November, had prayed [...] "for the success of the great action". Coke called Garnet [...] "a doctor of five Ds, namely, of dissimulation, of deposing of princes, of disposing of kingdoms, of daunting and deterring of subjects, and of destruction". His supposed inappropriate relationship with Anne Vaux was mentioned, but his adherence to the doctrine of equivocation proved extremely damaging. Francis Tresham's deathbed letter, which claimed that Garnet had played no part in the so-called Spanish Treason, was read aloud. [...] Tresham claimed not to have seen Garnet [...] "for fifteen or sixteen years before", despite government evidence that the two had met more recently. Garnet had not seen the letter and did not know that it referred to events before 1602, not 1605. He was unable to explain it, except by saying [...] "it may be, my Lord, that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> equivocate." ...|$|E
500|$|Not every 20th-century critic opined {{primarily}} {{on the quality of}} the final lines when discussing the success or failure of the poem; Sidney Colvin, in 1920, explained that [...] "while imagery drawn from the sculptures on Greek vases was still floating through his mind, he was able to rouse himself to a stronger effort and produce a true masterpiece in his famous Ode on a Grecian Urn." [...] In his 1926 analysis, H. W. Garrod felt that the end of the poem did not match with the rest of the poem: [...] "Perhaps the fourth stanza is more beautiful than any of the others—and more true. The trouble is that it is a little too true. Truth to his main theme has taken Keats rather farther than <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> go... This pure cold art makes, in fact, a less appeal to Keats than the Ode as a whole would pretend; and when, in the lines that follow these lines, he indulges the jarring apostrophe 'Cold Pastoral' [...] he has said more than he meant—or wished to mean." [...] In 1933, M. R. Ridley described the poem as a [...] "tense ethereal beauty" [...] with a [...] "touch of didacticism that weakens the urgency" [...] of the statements. Douglas Bush, following in 1937, emphasized the Greek aspects of the poem and stated, [...] "as in the Ode to Maia, the concrete details are suffused with a rich nostalgia. The hard edges of classical Greek writing are softened by the enveloping emotion and suggestion. In his classical moments Keats is a sculptor whose marble becomes flesh." ...|$|E
