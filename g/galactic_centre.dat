5|$|The Solar System travels alone {{through the}} Milky Way in a {{circular}} orbit approximately 30,000light years from the <b>Galactic</b> <b>Centre.</b> Its speed is about 220km/s. The period required for the Solar System to complete one revolution around the <b>Galactic</b> <b>Centre,</b> the galactic year, is {{in the range of}} 220–250 million years. Since its formation, the Solar System has completed at least 20 such revolutions.|$|E
5|$|Shapley's {{measurements}} {{also indicated}} that the Sun is relatively far {{from the center of}} the galaxy, also contrary to what had previously been inferred from the apparently nearly even distribution of ordinary stars. In reality, most ordinary stars lie within the galaxy's disk and those stars that lie in the direction of the <b>galactic</b> <b>centre</b> and beyond are thus obscured by gas and dust, whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much further distances.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System's {{location}} in the Milky Way {{is a factor in}} the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Its orbit is close to circular, and orbits near the Sun are at roughly the same speed as that of the spiral arms. Therefore, the Sun passes through arms only rarely. Because spiral arms are home to a far larger concentration of supernovae, gravitational instabilities, and radiation that could disrupt the Solar System, this has given Earth long periods of stability for life to evolve. The Solar System also lies well outside the star-crowded environs of the <b>galactic</b> <b>centre.</b> Near the centre, gravitational tugs from nearby stars could perturb bodies in the Oort cloud and send many comets into the inner Solar System, producing collisions with potentially catastrophic implications for life on Earth. The intense radiation of the <b>galactic</b> <b>centre</b> could also interfere with the development of complex life. Even at the Solar System's current location, some scientists have speculated that recent supernovae may have adversely affected life in the last 35,000 years, by flinging pieces of expelled stellar core towards the Sun, as radioactive dust grains and larger, comet-like bodies.|$|E

Measures employed to ameliorate this situation include the usage of powerful special-purpose hardware devices (Makino and Taiji [1998]) or graphical processing units (GPUs, Gaburov et al.

5|$|The Solar System {{is located}} in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with a {{diameter}} of about 100,000 light-years containing about 100 billion stars. The Sun resides in one of the Milky Way's outer spiral arms, known as the Orion–Cygnus Arm or Local Spur. The Sun lies between 25,000 and 28,000 light-years from the <b>Galactic</b> <b>Centre,</b> and its speed within the Milky Way is about 220km/s, so that it completes one revolution every 225–250 million years. This revolution is known as the Solar System's galactic year. The solar apex, the direction of the Sun's path through interstellar space, is near the constellation Hercules {{in the direction of the}} current location of the bright star Vega. The plane of the ecliptic lies at an angle of about 60° to the galactic plane.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the comets}} seen {{close to the}} Sun seem to have reached their current {{positions}} through gravitational perturbation of the Oort cloud by the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way. Just as the Moon's tidal force deforms Earth's oceans, causing the tides to rise and fall, the galactic tide also distorts the orbits of bodies in the outer Solar System. In the charted regions of the Solar System, these effects are negligible compared to {{the gravity of the}} Sun, but in the outer reaches of the system, the Sun's gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field has substantial effects. Galactic tidal forces stretch the cloud along an axis directed toward the <b>galactic</b> <b>centre</b> and compress it along the other two axes; these small perturbations can shift orbits in the Oort cloud to bring objects close to the Sun. The point at which the Sun's gravity concedes its influence to the galactic tide is called the tidal truncation radius. It lies at a radius of 100,000 to 200,000 AU, and marks the outer boundary of the Oort cloud.|$|E

25|$|In our galaxy, the {{distribution}} of clusters depends on age, with older clusters being preferentially found at greater distances from the <b>galactic</b> <b>centre,</b> generally at substantial distances above or below the galactic plane. Tidal forces are stronger nearer {{the centre of the}} galaxy, increasing the rate of disruption of clusters, and also the giant molecular clouds which cause the disruption of clusters are concentrated towards the inner regions of the galaxy, so clusters in the inner regions of the galaxy tend to get dispersed at a younger age than their counterparts in the outer regions.|$|E

Here this once bright yellow star will fall below naked-eye visibility somewhere in the faint present day southern constellation of Telescopium.

25|$|The arms of spiral galaxies rotate {{around the}} <b>galactic</b> <b>centre.</b> The {{luminous}} mass density of a spiral galaxy decreases as one goes from the centre to the outskirts. If luminous mass {{were all the}} matter, then we can model the galaxy as a point mass in the centre and test masses orbiting around it (similar to the solar system). From Kepler's Second Law, we expect that the rotation velocities will decrease with distance from the centre, similar to our solar system. This is not observed. Instead, the galaxy rotation curve remains flat as distant from the centre as the data is available.|$|E
25|$|The flux of {{secondary}} particles and X-ray and gamma-rays of atmospheric origin {{produced by the}} interaction of the cosmic rays is very low. This low background, in the presence of which one has to detect the feeble signal from cosmic sources is a major advantage in conducting hard X-ray observations from India. The second advantage is that many bright sources like Cyg X-1, Crab Nebula, Scorpius X-1 and <b>Galactic</b> <b>Centre</b> sources are observable from Hyderabad due to their favourable declination. With these considerations, an X-ray astronomy group was formed at TIFR in 1967 and development of an instrument with an orientable X-ray telescope for hard X-ray observations was undertaken. The first balloon flight with the new instrument was made on 28 April 1968 in which observations of Scorpius X-1 were successfully carried out. In a succession of balloon flights made with this instrument between 1968 and 1974 a number of binary X-ray sources including Cyg X-1 and Her X-1, and the diffuse cosmic X-ray background were studied. Many new and astrophysically important results were obtained from these observations.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the structure of}} self-gravitating marginally stable accretion discs in <b>galactic</b> <b>centres</b> in which {{a small fraction of}} the disc mass has been converted into protostars. We find that protostars accrete gaseous disc matter at prodigious rates. Mainly due to the stellar accretion luminosity, the disc heats up and thickens geometrically, shutting off further disc fragmentation. The existing protostars, however, continue to gain mass by gas accretion. As a result, the initial mass function for disc-born stars at distances R∼ 0. 03 – 3  pc from the supermassive black hole should be top-heavy. The effect is most pronounced at around R∼ 0. 1  pc. We suggest that this result explains observations of rings of young massive stars in our Galaxy and in M 31, and we predict that more such rings will be discovered.

50|$|Two {{interacting}} galaxies {{will not}} always collide head-on (if at all), and the tidal forces will distort each galaxy along an axis pointing roughly towards {{and away from}} its perturber. As the two galaxies briefly orbit each other, these distorted regions, which are pulled away from the main body of each galaxy, will be sheared by the galaxy's differential rotation and flung off into intergalactic space, forming tidal tails. Such tails are typically strongly curved. If a tail appears to be straight, it is probably being viewed edge-on. The stars and gas that comprise the tails will have been pulled from the easily distorted galactic discs (or other extremities) of one or both bodies, rather than the gravitationally bound <b>galactic</b> <b>centres.</b> Two very prominent examples of collisions producing tidal tails are the Mice Galaxies and the Antennae Galaxies.|$|R

500|$|Various {{scientists}} {{have speculated that}} the Solar System's path through the galaxy {{is a factor in}} the periodicity of mass extinctions observed in the Earth's fossil record. One hypothesis supposes that vertical oscillations made by the Sun as it orbits the <b>Galactic</b> <b>Centre</b> cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic disc, the influence of the galactic tide is weaker; as it re-enters the galactic disc, as it does every 20–25million years, it comes {{under the influence of the}} far stronger [...] "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of Oort cloud comets into the Solar System by a factor of 4, leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating impact.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility that}} present-day galactic haloes contain a population of massive black holes (MBHs) that form by hierarchical merging of the black hole remnants of the first stars. Some of the MBHs may be large enough or {{close enough to the}} <b>centre</b> of the <b>galactic</b> host that they merge within a Hubble time. We estimate to what extent this process could contribute to the mass of the super-massive black holes (SMBHs) observed in <b>galactic</b> <b>centres</b> today. Many MBHs will not reach the centre of the main halo, however, but continue to orbit within satellite subhaloes. Using a semi-analytical approach that explicitly accounts for dynamical friction, tidal disruption and encounters with the galactic disk, we follow the dynamics of the satellites and their MBHs and determine the abundance and distribution of MBHs in present-day haloes of various masses. Considering two different accretion scenarios we also compute the bolometric luminosity function for the MBHs. Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 11 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear spirals {{can provide}} a wealth of {{information}} about the nuclear potential in disc galaxies. They are unlikely to form in nuclei with solid-body rotation, yet they are present in a majority of <b>galactic</b> <b>centres.</b> Their morphology varies depending on whether a central massive black hole (MBH) is present or absent in the galaxy. In this paper I consider predictions of the linear theory for waves induced in gas by asymmetric gravitational potential, which are applicable to the nuclear spirals observed in galaxies. Generation and propagation of waves is governed by dynamical resonances, and inclusion of a MBH can move or even create resonances, greatly altering the extent and shape of the nuclear spiral. I will use predictions of the linear theory presented here as a guideline when interpreting hydrodynamical models in the second paper of this series. I also comment on modifications that self-gravity in gas imposes on the induced waves. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures, MNRAS, accepte...|$|R
40|$|The {{case for}} {{collapsed}} objects in some X-ray binary systems continues to strengthen.

These phenomena (especially the gas-dynamical aspects) are still a daunting challenge to theorists, but there is `cleaner' evidence, based on stellar dynamics, for collapsed objects in the centres of most nearby galaxies. The current evidence does not tell us the spin of the collapsed objects [...] nor, indeed, whether they are described by Kerr geometry, as general relativity theory predicts. There are now, however, several hopeful prospects of discovering observational signatures that will indeed probe the strong-gravity domain. Comment: 22 pages Latex no figures.

40|$|We {{present results}} on the {{radiation}} drag exerted by an isotropic and homogenous background of Lya photons on neutral gas clouds orbiting within HII regions around Population III stars of different masses. The Doppler shift causes a frequency difference between photons {{moving in the direction}} of the cloud and opposite to it resulting in a net momentum loss of the cloud in the direction of motion. We find that half of the angular momentum of gas with v_theta 10 ^ 8 yr even for low velocity clouds. Our results suggest that a sweet spot exists for the loss of angular momentum by radiation drag for gas clouds at z > 10 and with v ~ 20 km/s. Comparison to dynamical friction forces acting on typical gas clouds suggest that radiation drag is the dominant effect impacting the orbit. We propose that this effect can suppress the formation of extended gas discs in the first galaxies and help gas accretion near <b>galactic</b> <b>centres</b> and central black holes.

40|$|Abstract. We first discuss {{two-body}} {{and chain}} regularization methods for direct N-body simulations on HARP- 2 and GRAPE- 6. The former {{is used for}} accurate integration of perturbed binaries and hierarchies, whereas the latter deals with strong interactions involving binaries. Combined with a powerful stability criterion for hierarchical systems, this versatile treatment provides an efficient way of studying all dynamical processes in globular clusters containing a realistic population of primordial binaries. These algorithms are also ideal for modelling a variety of astrophysical effects, such as averaging over Kozai cycles, tidal circularization, spin-orbit coupling and stellar collisions, where well-defined elements are used to describe near-singular solutions. We also describe a new time-transformed leapfrog scheme which has been developed to deal with black-hole binaries in <b>galactic</b> <b>centres.</b> This formulation is valid for large mass ratios and dominant two-body motions in a compact subsystem can be treated accurately in the post-Newtonian approximation.

40|$|We analyse the {{evolution}} of colour gradients predicted by the hydrodynamical models of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in Pipino et al., which reproduce fairly well the chemical abundance pattern and the metallicity gradients of local ETGs. We convert the star formation (SF) and metal content into colours by means of stellar population synthetic model and investigate the role of different physical ingredients, as the initial gas distribution and content, and ɛSF, i. e. the normalization of SF rate. From the comparison with high-redshift data, a full agreement with optical rest-frame observations at z ≲ 1 is found, for models with low ɛSF, whereas some discrepancies emerge at 1 < z < 2, despite our models reproduce quite well the data scatter at these redshifts. To reconcile the prediction of these high ɛSF systems with the shallower colour gradients observed at lower z we suggest intervention of one to two dry mergers.
