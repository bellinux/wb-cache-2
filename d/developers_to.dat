It was prone to display web pages differently from other browsers, causing web <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> spend time tweaking their web pages. Acid2 challenged Microsoft to make Internet Explorer comply with web standards.|$|E

It does not require the <b>developer</b> <b>to</b> open the products using Firebird or even custom-derivatives made from its source code, but if the <b>developer</b> chooses <b>to</b> do so, then some terms and conditions should be honored. The IDPL allows the <b>developer</b> <b>to</b> make proprietary, closed-source applications that use Firebird or are based on it.|$|R
5|$|As of January 2015, Valve {{themselves}} had provided some user-developed Workshop content as paid-for features in Valve-developed games, including Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2; with over $57 million {{being paid to}} content creators using the Workshop. Valve began allowing <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> use these advanced features in January 2015; both the developer and content generator share the profits of the sale of these items; the feature went live in April 2015, starting with various mods for Skyrim. This feature was pulled a few days afterward following negative user feedback and reports of pricing and copyright misuse. Six months later, Valve stated they were still interested in offering this type of functionality in the future, but would review the implementation to avoid these previous mistakes. In November 2015, the Steam client was updated with the ability for game <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> offer in-game items for direct sale via the store interface, with Rust being the first game to use the feature.|$|E
5|$|Bob Muglia was {{influential}} in a corporate restructuring at Microsoft in 1999, which assigned business divisions to customer types, rather than technologies. As {{part of the}} re-structuring, Muglia became head of the business-productivity group, which oversaw Microsoft Office, Exchange and other business software. According to Computer Reseller News, Muglia pushed <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> visit customers, created customer advisory boards and led other efforts to incorporate customer input into product development at Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|Increases in {{development}} budgets and team sizes meant that sequels took {{three or more}} years to be released, instead of the almost-yearly releases seen in SSI's Gold Box series. The growth of development teams increased the likelihood that software bugs would appear, as code produced by programmers working in different teams was merged into a whole. A lack of technical standards among hardware manufacturers forced <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> support each manufacturer's implementation, or risk losing players.|$|E

A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and {{made it easier for}} <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland loss is a growing problem for the nuthatch.|$|E
5|$|The {{approval}} of the tower was controversial due to the plot ratio concessions made by the Perth City Council to the developers. These concessions enabled the <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> construct a tower {{more than twice the}} height which would otherwise be allowable on the site. There was also opposition to the Council's decision to ignore its own town planning experts in allowing a large car park to be constructed underneath the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{upgraded}} engine offered better {{speed efficiency}} and new graphical features. While both the original Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider II used a grid system where developers could build the levels {{with a set}} of blocks, Tomb Raider IIIs system incorporated triangular polygons, allowing <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> achieve greater detail and more complex architectural structures. The triangles also allowed <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> implement the game's quicksand and rippling water features. The dynamic lighting system was improved with coloured lighting and better water reflection, making Tomb Raider III more atmospheric than its predecessors. The team also implemented new weather effects such as rain, snow, and wind. The game features more particle effects, offering more realistic explosions and smoke. All the textures used in the game were drawn in true colour before being rendered by the graphics engine, resulting in a better output quality.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Resident Evil 3 was released, {{development}} on Code: Veronica was nearing completion. Much of Code: Veronicas 70-person development staff was outsourced because Capcom resources had been tied up working on Resident Evil 3. Shinji Mikami and Yoshiki Okamoto's team at Flagship oversaw the game's scenario and direction, while XAX Entertainment assisted with environments and Nextech handled {{much of the}} technical development. Capcom Production Studio 4 still handled art direction and character design. By September 1999, Sega was sending some of its own <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> help add final touches to the game. Sega assisted Capcom with the game's programming to help keep a good framerate.|$|E
5|$|Developer {{communities}} {{have used the}} SDK to port later versions of Windows Mobile OS to older devices and making the OS images available for free, thus providing the devices with the current feature set. Microsoft has tolerated this procedure for some time but decided in February 2007 to ask <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> take their OS images off the net, which in turn raised discussions. At the same time Microsoft offered upgrades to Windows Mobile 6 versions to manufacturers for free.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2010, soon after id Software gave MachineGames the {{rights for the}} franchise. The {{development}} team envisioned Wolfenstein: The New Order as a first-person action-adventure game, taking inspiration from previous games in the series and particularly focusing on the combat and adventure elements. The game attempts to delve into character development of Blazkowicz, unlike its predecessors—a choice from the <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> interest players in the story. They also aimed to portray him in a heroic fashion.|$|E
40|$|Source code {{examples}} are valuable <b>to</b> <b>developers</b> needing <b>to</b> use an unfamiliar {{application programming interface}} (API). Numerous approaches exist <b>to</b> help <b>developers</b> locate source code examples; while some of these help the <b>developer</b> <b>to</b> select the most promising examples, none help the <b>developer</b> <b>to</b> reuse the example itself. Without explicit tool support for the complete end-to-end task, the developer can waste time and energy on examples that ultimately fail to be appropriate; as a result, the overhead required to reuse an example can restrict a <b>developer’s</b> willingness <b>to</b> investigate multiple examples to find the “best ” one for their situation.

5|$|During the 2015 Build keynote, Microsoft {{announced}} a Universal Windows Platform bridge {{that would allow}} Android and iOS software to be ported to Windows 10 Mobile and published to the Windows Store. In August 2015, A version of the Microsoft Android bridge toolset {{was reported to be}} leaked and available on the internet along with its documentation. The leaked toolset required <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> register and use the WNS to send notification data to ported applications, and would not allow for Google Cloud Messaging to be used instead. Microsoft later discontinued the Android bridge project in favor of continuing support for iOS application porting instead.|$|E
5|$|From {{its release}} in 1998, Half-Life saw fervent support from {{independent}} game developers, due {{in no small}} part to support and encouragement from Valve Software. Worldcraft, the level-design tool used during the game's development, was included with the game software. Printed materials accompanying the game indicated Worldcraft's eventual release as a retail product, but these plans never materialized. Valve also released a software development kit, enabling <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> modify the game and create mods. Both tools were significantly updated with the release of the version 1.1.0.0 patch. Many supporting tools (including texture editors, model editors, and rival level editors like the multiple engine editor QuArK) were either created or updated to work with Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is an {{additional}} level for the 2004 first-person shooter video game Half-Life 2. Developed by Valve Corporation, it was released on October 27, 2005, through the Steam content delivery service as a free download to owners of the Microsoft Windows version of Half-Life 2. Lost Coast serves as a technology demonstration, specifically showcasing the high-dynamic-range rendering implemented in the Source engine. The level was designed {{with a variety of}} appropriate environments to emphasize these effects. In addition, Lost Coast was the first video game developed by Valve to allow <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> explain various elements of design as the player progresses through the level.|$|E

Some games {{attempted to}} incorporate elements of first person shooter or survival horror games {{through the use of}} less restricted character movement and exploration, with varying degrees of success. Others, however, unashamedly paid homage to 1990s arcade gameplay, even embracing a somewhat parodic style. Light guns are not compatible with modern high-definition televisions, leading <b>developers</b> <b>to</b> experiment with hybrid controllers, particularly with the Wii Remote for the Wii, as well as the PlayStation 3's GunCon 3 peripheral used with Time Crisis 4. Others have used the PlayStation Move motion control system.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008 Juniper's first CEO, Scott Kriens, became {{chairman}} and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO.
