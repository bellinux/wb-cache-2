At that time she would run a regular single daily service on weekdays leaving at 0915 from Penzance and then returning to Penzance from St. Mary's leaving at 1530. On Saturdays she was scheduled to run a <b>double</b> <b>service</b> leaving earlier {{in the morning and}} making a quick turnaround at lunchtime in St. Mary's and then performing a second return voyage in the afternoon. In 1990 it was decided to change the service and only run a seasonal operation. The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company Ltd. later purchased a smaller cargo vessel purely for freight and Scillonian III was put into maintenance and repair during the winter months.|$|E

He {{is best known for}} two fundamental discoveries in astronomy, the aberration of light (1725–1728), and the nutation of the Earth's axis (1728–1748). [...] These discoveries were called [...] "the most brilliant and useful of the century" [...] by Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre, historian of astronomy, mathematical astronomer and director of the Paris Observatory, in his history of astronomy in the 18th century (1821), because [...] "It is to these two discoveries by Bradley that we owe the exactness of modern astronomy. ....

6000|$|The steed in {{question}} had been purchased for {{her by her}} father from the Gauchos, who assured him that the animal was a remarkably good one to go. They told the simple truth, but not the whole truth, for sometimes it would [...] "go" [...] with its hind-legs doing <b>double</b> <b>service</b> {{in the way of}} kicking, and, at other times, it balanced that feat by giving its fore-legs a prodigious flourish while in the act of rearing. To do the creature justice, however, it could and did go ahead of its companions on the journey, and retained that position without fatigue, as was evinced by the flashing eye, distended nostril, pawing and snorting with which it received every proposal to halt.|$|E
60|$|So {{here was}} I, in a <b>double</b> <b>service,</b> who, before I met Brother Thomas, had been free {{of heart and}} hand.

But my own hopes were not high, nor could I mark any sign that she favoured me more than another, though I had the joy to be often in her company. And, indeed, what hope could I have, being so young, and poor, and in visible station no more than any 'prentice lad? My heart was much tormented in these fears, and mainly because we heard no tidings that the Maid was accepted by the Dauphin, and that {{the day of her}} marching, and of my deliverance from my base craft of painting, was at hand.|$|E
60|$|Three horses, {{two with}} riders, moved in dark shapes across the skyline above the ridge, {{disappeared}} as had Shefford's first visitor, and then rode into the light. Shefford saw two Indians--a {{man and a}} woman; then with surprise recognized the latter to be the Indian girl he had met at Red Lake. He was still more surprised to recognize in the third horse {{the one he had}} lost at the last camp. Shefford rose, a little shaky on his legs, to thank these Indians for a <b>double</b> <b>service.</b> The man slipped from his saddle and his moccasined feet thudded lightly. He was tall, lithe, erect, a singularly graceful figure, and as he advanced Shefford saw a dark face and sharp, dark eyes. The Indian was bareheaded, with his hair bound in a band. He resembled the girl, but appeared to have a finer face.|$|E

60|$|Swedenborg has {{rendered}} a <b>double</b> <b>service</b> to mankind, {{which is}} now only beginning to be known. By the science of experiment and use, {{he made his first}} steps; he observed and published the laws of nature; and, ascending by just degrees, from events to their summits and causes, he was fired with piety at the harmonies he felt, and abandoned himself to his joy and worship. This was his first service. If the glory was too bright for his eyes to bear, if he staggered under the trance of delight, the more excellent is the spectacle he saw, the realities of being which beam and blaze through him, and which no infirmities of the prophet are suffered to obscure; and he renders a second passive service to men, not less than the first,--perhaps, in the great circle of being, and in the retributions of spiritual nature, not less glorious or less beautiful to himself.|$|E
60|$|The singers, on the {{establishment}} of a <b>double</b> <b>service,</b> began to absent themselves at least once on a Sunday, so Mr Harford and the ladies tried to arrange for the singing of the children instead. He had no knowledge of music, which was then thought a rather doubtful accomplishment for a young man, and Mrs Thorpe had, if possible, less, so all that could be done was for Dora to train the children by ear; and she found that their thin, shrill notes were held as painful by all save a few doting mothers, her sisters, and herself. The captain laughed at her, and finally promised her a grinding organ. It came; it could play four tunes, and all the singers were naturally offended. But on the first Sunday there was a great catastrophe, for when once set on it would not stop, but went on playing its four tunes long after the Old Hundredth was finished. Mr Harford waited to begin the Prayer for King George till it had finished, hoping that it would stop, if not {{at the end of the}} second tune at least at the fourth; but, behold, it started off with the Old Hundredth again, upon which Captain Carbonel emerged from his pew, and, with the help of Master Pucklechurch, bore it out into the churchyard, where it continued to play till after the service, when there was time to check its pertinacity by adjustment of the machinery. At its best, the singers--even George Hewlett--were much hurt, and the compromise was made that it never should uplift its voice when they were present in full force with bass, flute, and viol, but should only draw forth its four tunes when there were only the children to need the accompaniment.|$|E

5000|$|Writing in The Stage, Stewart Pringle remarked, [...] "Sweep {{away the}} desperate and {{derelict}} controversy that's frothed around its broadcast, and this TV adaptation of Mike Bartlett's 2014 future-history play King Charles III is a delightful anachronism - {{a play for}} today". He observed that the translation from stage to screen had resulted in [...] "a production that cosies close to the text, and to the performers who made it sing", but also that, [...] "there are inevitable alterations, both gains and losses, {{that have occurred in}} the translation. Many are contextual - the effect of a soliloquy delivered to an audience is startlingly different to a monologue delivered straight to camera". Pringle found the echoes of Ian Richardson's [...] "to-camera monologues" [...] in the To Play the King series of the House of Cards trilogy to be problematic, and also [...] "the language and meter. What felt ingenious on stage occasionally clunks on screen, and while some of the strangeness fades as the gallop of Bartlett's story-telling takes off, it still feels hazardously close to the kind of fakespeare gimmickery that the original production side-stepped". However, he praised [...] "the 11th hour capturing of Tim Pigott-Smith's career-best performance as the beleaguered monarch. Frailer now, or perhaps just frailer in close-up, his shifts from bewilderment to iron resolve, his half-fatherly half-vengeful stare are as powerful as anything on telly, stage or elsewhere". Pringle concluded, [...] "It remains a cracking story, Bartlett's plotting a pure pleasure, his satire stiletto-sharp. Pigott-Smith holds the screen, utterly, as he did the stage, and Goold has done a <b>double</b> <b>service</b> in bronze-casting that performance for future generations, and building a rare and encouraging bridge between the telly-box and some of the country's best and brightest new stage writing".|$|E
