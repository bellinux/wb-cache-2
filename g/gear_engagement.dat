5000|$|In a sliding-mesh gearbox, {{individual}} gears are mounted so they always engage the shaft, but gears on one shaft {{can be moved}} axially. To engage a particular pair of gears, one gear is slid axially until it fully engages a gear on the other shaft. If the gear shafts are spinning so the two gears have the same surface speed, the gears are relatively easy to engage. However, if speeds are mismatched, the gears tend to [...] "bounce" [...] off each other at first contact and resist engagement. Thus, <b>gear</b> <b>engagement</b> relies on the driver carefully matching speeds, typically through practice and intuition.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the methodology for designing the teeth conjunction of planetary gears in the planetary roller screw mechanism. A {{function of the}} planetary gears is to synchronize an operation of rollers {{in order to avoid}} axial displacements. A condition of the correct operation is no axial movement of rollers in relation to the nut. The planetary gears are integral parts of rollers and therefore an operation of the gear transmissions has a direct impact on cooperation of the screw, rollers and the nut. The proper design of <b>gear</b> <b>engagements</b> is essential for reducing slippage on surfaces of the cooperating threaded elements. For this purpose, in a designing method, both the limitations of operation and kinematic conditions of rollers’ operation have to be taken into account...|$|R

50|$|However, {{even with}} these {{electronic}} protection systems, a car is not prevented from redlining through inadvertent <b>gear</b> <b>engagement.</b> If a driver accidentally selects a lower gear when trying to shift up or selects a lower gear than intended while shifting down (as in a motorbike sequential manual transmission), the engine {{will be forced to}} rapidly rev-up to match the speed of the drivetrain. If this happens while the engine is at high rpms, it may dramatically exceed the redline. For example, if the operator is driving close to redline in 3rd gear and attempts to shift to 4th gear but unintentionally puts the car in 2nd by mistake, the transmission will be spinning much faster than the engine, and when the clutch is released the engine’s rpm will increase rapidly. It will lead to a rough and very noticeable engine braking, and likely engine damage. This is often known as a 'money shift' because of the likelihood of engine damage and the expense of fixing the engine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Spur and {{helical gears}} {{can be used}} to {{transmit}} very large power between two parallel shafts. However in spur <b>gears</b> the <b>engagement</b> between two meshing teeth is sudden line contact over entire face width which results in generation of noise and higher dynamic load. In helical <b>gears</b> the <b>engagement</b> between two meshing teeth begins with point contact and gradually extends diagonally along the gear tooth surface, resulting in quiet operation. Hence normally spur gears are used for low speed power transmission (20 m/s) and helical gears are preferred for high speed. A considerable {{research in the area of}} bending stress analysis of involute spur gear has been carried out. However it is seen that a very little work has been carried out on stress analysis of involute helical gears. For finding stress concentration & stress pattern in the body, experimental stress analysis is very useful & is employed extensively. In Eco Board Industries Limited., Islampur (Maharashtra), spreading machine is used to spread bagasse in the formation of particle board. Positive Infinite Variable (PIV) gear box is used to transmit the power to belt conveyor of spreading machine which contains helical gears. The power transmitted by gear box is 2. 2 kW at 760 rpm while speed reduction is 1 : 70. In working condition of gear box it has been observed that helical pinion mounted on motor shaft fails due to load coming on the teeth. It seems that the failure is due to stress concentration and bending stresses at tooth root of gear. The crack is initiated just near to high stress concentration region of gear. The calculation of maximum tensile stress of helical gear at tooth root is three dimensional problem. The accurate evaluation of stress state and distribution of stress i...|$|R

40|$|In the literature, many {{models for}} {{depicting}} the gear mating dynamics are present. In addition, finite element techniques allow to perform highly representative engagement analysis, {{but with a}} high computational effort and in particular only after having defined a semi-definitive geometry.

In this direction, an accurate parametric model of <b>gear</b> <b>engagement,</b> which requires a little computational effort, is an enabling technology. In the present paper, the Harmonic Balance Method is used to build a simple engagement model able to predict the dynamic effect in teeth contact and to investigate the contribution to gear dynamics due to actual static transmission error and the contact ratio. A particular emphasis is given to the actual contact ratio estimation and the relationship between the teeth stiffness and the dynamic transmission error. As principal result, the possibility to design teeth stiffness in order to minimize dynamic transmission error is investigated and HBM potential for reaching this goal is evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{creating}} the accurate 3 D geometry model of the plane enveloping hourglass worm efficiently. The working tooth surfaces of the worm are enveloped by the mother plane surfaces. And according to the <b>gear</b> <b>engagement</b> theory, the equations of the surfaces enveloped are established. By combination with engineering practice, the geometrical features of the surface enveloped are analyzed, {{and one of its}} features {{is that it is a}} ruled surface consisted of countless straight lines which are contact lines. For ∑(u, Φ 1), which represents the surface enveloped, let the variable u equals two values respectively, and two helix curves are gained. Connect the two curves with a ruled surface, and make sure that the ruled surface is consisted of contact lines. So the surface gained is a enveloped surface with no error existing in theory. Once the surfaces enveloped are gained, it’s easy to create the geometry model of the worm. Using UG, the paper provides an example showing how to create the worm’s model, and the new method and a past method are both used to create the model. The new method not only creates an accurate model, but also improves the efficiency.

40|$|Structural {{topology}} optimization methods have existing and been improving theoretically since 1980 s; however, in industry, {{with respect to}} the certain conditions, proper modification is always desired. This study develops a specific method to utilize {{topology optimization}} for gearbox housing design. Gearbox housing maintains the position of the shafts to ensure the precision of <b>gear</b> <b>engagement</b> in all operational states (Naunheimer, et al., 2010). The current housing design processing used in Vicura AB, a Swedish powertrain company, is able to achieve stiff optimal housing material distribution, but difficult to fulfil gear misalignment requirement.

The paper is starting with an introduction of the previous method and its defects, followed by a discussion of three possible improvements. Only one of them is feasible and two main difficulties need to be resolved to make it applicable. One of the difficulties is finding a linear assumption of the non-linear components and the other is deriving an approach for topology optimization involving both external forces and non-zero prescribed displacements. The corresponding solutions are described subsequently in detail both theoretically and practically. Then the results by implementing the new method and also the comparison with the results getting from the old method are presented. Finally, a validation of the new method is discussed and the conclusions and comments are given...|$|E

40|$|Coupling {{worm gears}} in large machine tool {{manipulator}} units (axes) {{can lead to}} overload damages under some operating conditions, like asymmetrical driving and emergency stop. This behaviour {{is caused by the}} self locking characteristic of worm gears with small pitch. If operated in the direction opposite to the designated one, self-locking can occur in the gears, subjecting the gears to an arbitrary torque which can be destructive. This condition can occur without counter torque on the driving side. In most <b>gears,</b> tooth <b>engagement</b> is based on a rolling motion. The slip component increases with a growing axis angle between the paired gears. In case of worm gears, the axis angle is 90 _, and therefore the coupling is purely frictious. This friction coupling is important in modelling. Especially the transition between the static and dynamic friction, where the system parameters change abruptly by a factor of two, should not be neglected. Based on the evaluated model a synchronous controller has been developed. This controller gives the oppertunity to drive swiveling axes with coupled selflocking gears by a standard gantry topology with an overlayed state changing master-slave topolog...|$|R

Rieger, Spalling formation mechanism for gears, Wear 254 (2003) 1307 - 1317]. The mathematical model is established by utilising the numerical data obtained from the previous Finite Element Analysis [Y. Ding, R. Jones, B. T.
