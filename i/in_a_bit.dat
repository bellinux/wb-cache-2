5|$|Hargitay {{made his}} first film {{appearance}} with Mansfield <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> part in Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?. The couple became a popular publicity and performing team who toured widely in stage shows, where Mansfield's leopard-spot bikini became a topic of discussion and newspaper coverage. As a highlight, Hargitay tossed her around his waist and spun her in wide circles as her shows made more headlines. On screen, he was Mansfield's male lead in her Italian ventures—The Loves of Hercules and L'Amore Primitivo, and a major supporting character in Promises! Promises!. On stage, he was the male lead in The Tropicana Holiday, The House of Love, French Dressing, and other nightclub acts.|$|E

25|$|Kupcinet was {{encouraged}} into acting by her mother, {{and was given}} access to producers through the reputation of her father and his Kup's Column in the Sun-Times.

25|$|In late 1955, {{at the age}} of 25, McQueen left New York {{and headed}} for California, where he moved into a house on Vestal Avenue in the Echo Park area, seeking acting jobs in Hollywood. When McQueen {{appeared}} in a two-part television Westinghouse Studio One presentation entitled The Defenders, Hollywood manager Hilly Elkins (who managed McQueen's first wife, Neile) took note of him and decided that B-movies would be a good place for the young actor to make his mark. He landed his first film role <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> part in Somebody Up There Likes Me, directed by Robert Wise and starring Paul Newman. McQueen was subsequently hired for the films Never Love a Stranger, The Blob (his first leading role) which depicts a flesh eating amoeba-like space creature, and The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery.|$|E

25|$|In the 17th and 18th century, {{the style}} of {{winemaking}} in France was for heartier wines that could age and survive long transport voyages over seas. Winemaking text such as the 1803 annotated and updated edition of de Serres' Théâtre d'Agriculture began recommending that all fine producers employ {{the use of a}} wine press and that sometimes blending <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of the vin de presse to enhance color and body was essential to create a wine that could last. Even in Bordeaux, which was still using lagars long after Burgundy, Champagne and other French wine regions had adopted the basket press, saw the use of a wine press become more popular after darker, more full bodied wines of Ho-Bryan produced by Lord Arnaud III de Pontac began receive wide acclaim from English writers such as Jonathan Swift, John Locke and Samuel Pepys. By the end of the 18th century, nearly all prestigious Bordeaux wine estates were following de Pontac's method of giving the grapes more time to ferment in the vat and then using a basket press on the darker vin vermeilh and pressing it into new oak barrels.|$|E

500|$|Paramount {{decided to}} not screen the film for print critics before its release and wanted to focus on {{internet}} critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 35% approval rating with an average rating of 4.6/10 based on 159 reviews. The website's consensus reads, [...] "While fans of the Hasbro toy franchise may revel <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of nostalgia, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is largely a cartoonish, over-the-top action fest propelled by silly writing, inconsistent visual effects, and merely passable performances." [...] Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 32 out of 100, based on 25 reviews.|$|E
500|$|The Australian Financial Review (AFR) had {{for years}} carried stories {{critical}} of managed investment schemes.

With both Great Southern Group and Timbercorp under administration, the AFR continued its editorial attack on government MIS policy.

He wrote, [...] "The gut-punch moment is sufficiently gut-punchy, and we'll get to that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit.</b> But everything building up to it is so messy that the solidly dramatic moment almost made me angry. There's something about this show that leads to messy tonal mash-ups. But where the show's musical mash-ups are usually pretty harmonious, the tonal shifts can often be brutally unsubtle." [...] James Poniewozik of Time felt that it was notably inferior to the previous episode, with many more [...] "forgettable scenes and stories".|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale {{returned}} to acting in 2012 with appearances in three action films. Beckinsale {{first appeared in}} the action thriller Contraband.

The film was directed by Baltasar Kormákur, who also starred in the Icelandic language version of the film, Reykjavík-Rotterdam. The San Francisco Chronicle felt Beckinsale was [...] "stuck <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a thankless role as the victimised wife, but she does try to infuse a harder edge to the character." [...] The Hollywood Reporter stated that [...] "Beckinsale, her innate classiness calibrated down a few notches, has little to do but be supportive, worried and, eventually, besieged." [...] Entertainment Weekly felt that the [...] "woman-in-peril stuff is second-rate, giving off a whiff of exploitation" [...] while Variety found the repeated violence towards Beckinsale's character disturbing. The film had a production budget of $25million and has grossed over $96million worldwide.|$|E
