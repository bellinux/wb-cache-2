40|$|Comparison of two <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> is {{important}} in applications related to times to occurrence of a specific event. Conventional comparison procedures, such as the logrank, Gehan-Wilcoxon, and Peto-Peto tests, are powerful only when the two <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> do not cross each other. Because crossing <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> are common in practice, a number of procedures have been proposed in the literature for comparing such rates. However, most of these procedures only consider the alternative hypothesis with crossing hazard rates; many other realistic cases, including those when the two <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> run parallel to each other, are excluded from consideration. In this paper, we propose a two-stage procedure that considers all possible alternatives, including ones with crossing or running parallel <b>hazard</b> <b>rates.</b> To define its significance level and p-value properly, a new procedure for handling the crossing <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> problem is suggested, which has the property that its test statistic is asymptotically independent of the test statistic of the logrank test.

3000|$|As {{it can be}} seen in columns 2 a and 2 b of Table  2, each {{measure of}} SSW has a {{significant}} positive impact on its own <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> while a significant negative impact on the <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> of the alternative risk.

It is interesting to notice the negative sign that each measure of SSW has on the alternative exit route. We could interpret this finding in the following sense: if partial pensions are favoured, and hence SSW P [...] is increased, this will imply a reduction on the <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> to full retirement and a rise on the <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> to partial retirement, other things equal.|$|R

40|$|The paper proposes an {{additive}} continuous-time stochastic mortality model which revises that (B&H model) of Ballotta and Haberman (2006). The {{structure of}} the B&H model implies that the future <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> {{is proportional to the}} stochastic component, thus inducing two questionable features. First, in the B&H model, the uncertainty of the future <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> will be enlarged as the base <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> increases. However, an increase in the base <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> may not cause a dramatic increase suggested by the exponential component of B&H (2006). Second, in the B&H model, the uncertainty of the future <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> will be larger in the group which is older and will be greatly augmented by the interaction of age and time. But the uncertainty of the future <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> may not increase with an increase in age. The problems can be resolved by our additive structure which is the sum of a deterministic estimator and a stochastic component. Since using the additive structure will contribute {{to the fact that the}} stochastic component is independent of age and the base <b>hazard</b> <b>rate,</b> in our model the uncertainty of the future <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> will not be affected by an increase in age or in the base <b>hazard</b> <b>rate.</b> We further demonstrate an application of our model by calculating reserves of longevity risks for pure endowments and various common annuity products in the UK.
