I {{think of it}} as a tendency of the mind, as a psychological constitution which is a possibility for all mankind, but which has become actual in the most conspicuous fashion only amongst the Jews. Antisemitism itself will confirm my point of view.|$|E
500|$|Du Bois became incensed in 1961 {{when the}} U.S. Supreme Court upheld the 1950 McCarran Act, a key piece of McCarthyism {{legislation}} which required communists {{to register with}} the government. To demonstrate his outrage, he joined the Communist Party in October 1961, {{at the age of}} 93. Around that time, he wrote: [...] "I believe in communism. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> communism, a planned way of life in the production of wealth and work designed for building a state whose object is the highest welfare of its people and not merely the profit of a part." ...|$|E
500|$|Bopp did not own a telescope. He was {{out with}} friends near Stanfield, Arizona observing star {{clusters}} and galaxies when he chanced across the comet while at the eyepiece of his friend's telescope. He realized he might have spotted something new when, like Hale, he checked his star maps to determine if any other deep-sky objects {{were known to be}} near M70, and found that there were none. He alerted the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams through a Western Union telegram. Brian G. Marsden, who had run the bureau since 1968, laughed, [...] "Nobody sends telegrams anymore. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>by</b> the time that telegram got here, Alan Hale had already e-mailed us three times with updated coordinates." ...|$|E

500|$|In The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes {{set out to}} {{calculate}} the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged {{the notion that the}} number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote: [...] "There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of Hiero II), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited." [...] To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the myriad. The word is from the Greek [...] murias, for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million) and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 vigintillion, or 8.|$|E
2500|$|One {{definition}} is that {{law is a}} system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behaviour. In The Concept of Law Hart argued law is a [...] "system of rules"; Austin said law was [...] "the command of a sovereign, backed {{by the threat of}} a sanction"; Dworkin describes law as an [...] "interpretive concept" [...] to achieve justice in his text titled Law's Empire; and Raz argues law is an [...] "authority" [...] to mediate people's interests. Holmes said [...] "The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> the law." [...] In his Treatise on Law Aquinas argues that law is a rational ordering of things which concern the common good that is promulgated by whoever is charged with the care of the community. This definition has both positivist and naturalist elements.|$|E
2500|$|Theo {{referred}} to these pictorial {{elements in a}} letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: [...] "I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [...] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things." [...] Vincent responded in early November, [...] "Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe {{that in the long run}} you'd get used to it." [...] And later in the same letter, he wrote, [...] "I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses." ...|$|E

Which of you is {{actually}} right? Or may it be someone like Hasty Ninny ? His disciple said to him, 'I have attained your way, master. In winter I can light a cooking fire under a three-legged vessel and in summer I can make ice'. 'That's merely to attract [...] yang with yang and yin with yin'; said Hasty Ninny. 'It's not what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> the Way. I will show you my Way.' Thereupon he tuned two zithers. He placed {{one of them in}} the hall and the other in an inner chamber. When he plucked the note do [...] on one, do resonated [...] on the other, and when he plucked the note mi [...] on one, mi resonated [...] on the other. It's because their harmonies were the same. If he had retuned one of the strings so it didn't match any note in the pentatonic scale, and had then plucked it, all twenty-five strings on the other zither would have resonated [...] , not because there was any fundamental difference in the sound, but because it was the note that dominated all the rest. May it be that you thinkers are all like this?" [...] (23, tr. Mair 1994: 243) ...|$|E
