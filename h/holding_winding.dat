50|$|The Sinus <b>Holding</b> <b>Wind</b> Farm is an under {{construction}} wind power project in Vaslui County, Romania. It {{will consist of}} five individual wind farms connected together. It will have 350 individual wind turbines with a nominal output of around 2 MW which will deliver up to 700 MW of power, enough to power over 459,000 homes, with a capital investment required of approximately US$800 million.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} large wind farms under {{construction}} and these include Sinus <b>Holding</b> <b>Wind</b> Farm (700 MW), Anholt Offshore Wind Farm (400 MW), BARD Offshore 1 (400 MW), Clyde Wind Farm (350 MW), Greater Gabbard wind farm (500 MW), Lincs Wind Farm (270 MW), London Array (1000 MW), Lower Snake River Wind Project (343 MW), Macarthur Wind Farm (420 MW), Shepherds Flat Wind Farm (845 MW), and Sheringham Shoal (317 MW).|$|R

50|$|Conceptually, two {{adjacent}} mountains (natural or terrain-enabled) or artificial {{buildings or}} towers (urban or artificial) {{could have a}} wind turbine suspended between them by use of cables. When HAWP is cabled between two mountain tops across a valley, the HAWP device is not airborne, but borne up by the cable system. No such systems {{are known to be}} in use, though patents teach these methods. When non-cabled bridges are the foundation for <b>holding</b> <b>wind</b> turbines high above the ground, then these are grouped with conventional towered turbines and are outside the intent of HAWP where the tethering an airborne system is foundational.|$|R
