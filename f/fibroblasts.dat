High pretreatment levels of serum basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor {{have been shown to be}} associated with poor prognosis in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells express basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor and/or its receptor (<b>fibroblast</b> growth factor receptor- 1) and whether basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor expression correlates with basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor serum levels, intratumoral microvessel density, and patient outcome. We measured basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sera taken from 58 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma before treatment and in 19 of them also after treatment. Pathological specimens at diagnosis were evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining using polyoclonal antibody against factor-VIII-related antigen, basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor and <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor receptor- 1 to determine the expression of the microvessel count and basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor and <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor receptor- 1. The lymphoma specimens demonstrated positive staining for basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor (in 23 %) and <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor receptor- 1 (in 58. 5 %). The patients who expressed basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor had a significantly worse progression-free and overall survival than those who did not (P= 0. 003 and P= 0. 03 respectively), while patients expressing <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor receptor- 1 were less likely to achieve complete remission than those lacking the receptor (33 % vs 65 %, P= 0. 047). There was no correlation of basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor staining with either serum basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor levels or microvessel count. Basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor serum levels did not change significantly after treatment These results suggest that non-Hodgkin's lymphoma specimens express basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor and its receptor (<b>fibroblast</b> growth factor receptor- 1) and this expression is associated with poor patient outcome...|$|R
40|$|As {{the result}} of {{alternative}} mRNA splicing, Fgf- 5, the gene encoding <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5, translates to both long and short forms of the protein, respectively, designated <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 and <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 S. We previously showed that localization of <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 {{and the level of}} <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 S in murine skin are hair-cycle dependent. In this study, we examined the effect of <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 and <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 S on the hair growth cycle in mice. Once the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle was induced in the dorsal skin by depilation during telogen, and effects of subcutaneous injection of <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 and <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 S into the affected region were analyzed. We found that <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 inhibited hair growth during anagen and promoted the transition from anagen to catagen. Interestingly, whereas <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 S alone exerted no effect on hair growth, it significantly inhibited the catagen-promoting activity of <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 when the two proteins were injected simultaneously. Because neither <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 nor <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 S affected skin thickness, it is postulated that changes in skin thickness during hair cycle are separately regulated by factors other than those regulating hair and follicle growth. The present results, together with our earlier findings that <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 -producing cells gather around dermal papillae during catagen, whereas <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 S is abundantly expressed in the hair follicles only during the latter half of anagen, suggests that the mouse hair growth cycle is regulated by the two Fgf- 5 gene products acting in concert: <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 induces catagen, whereas <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor- 5 S antagonizes this activity during anagen...|$|R

25|$|Maculae flavae {{are located}} at the {{anterior}} and posterior ends of the membranous parts of the VF. The histological structure of the macula flava is unique, and Sato and Hirano speculated that it could {{play an important role}} in growth, development and aging of VF. The macula flava is composed of <b>fibroblasts,</b> ground substances, elastic and collagenous fibers. <b>Fibroblasts</b> were numerous and spindle or stellate-shaped. The <b>fibroblasts</b> have been observed to be in active phase, with some newly released amorphous materials present at their surface. From a biomechanical point of view, the role of the macula flava is very important. Hirano and Sato studies suggested that the macula flava is responsible for the synthesis of the fibrous components of the VF. <b>Fibroblasts</b> have been found mostly aligned in the direction of the vocal ligament, along bundles of fibers. It then was suggested that the mechanical stresses during phonation were stimulating the <b>fibroblasts</b> to synthesize those fibers.|$|E

Our findings confirm increased expression of <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor 8 in malignant breast tissue but also show significant <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor 8 expression in non-malignant breast epithelial cells. No significant difference in <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor 8 expression was found between different grades of ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in-situ or cancer of different oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor or nodal status. The highest levels of <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor 8 expression were found in lactating breast tissues and <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor 8 was also detected in human milk.

This fibroblast proliferation also contracts the tissue. In unwounded tissue, these fibers are not overexpressed with thick collagen and do not contract.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBasic <b>fibroblast</b> {{growth factor}} is {{increasingly}} implicated in cellular growth, differentiation, angiogenesis and oncogenesis. In culture, basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor greatly improved {{the growth rate}} of bovine brain cortex capillary endothelial cells.

Furthermore, staurosporine, a potent protein kinase inhibitor, showed strong antiproliferative activity against basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor-induced endothelial cell growth. Similarly, the chemotaxis effect of basic <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor on capillary endothelial cells was abolished by down-regulation of protein kinase C or by staurosporine treatment.

Some {{of the changes}} induced by <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor {{are similar to those}} seen after nerve growth factor treatment. Specifically, pituitary <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor causes the formation of processes initially comparable to those produced by nerve growth factor. However, in contrast to the outgrowth induced by nerve growth factor, which continues for several days, the outgrowth of processes induced by <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor ceases after about 3 days, even though fresh <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor is added. After about 6 days the processes induced by <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor have virtually disappeared. In this regard the processes induced by <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor are very similar to those induced by dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3 ’: 5 ’-monophosphate (dBcAMP). The addition of nerve growth factor and <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor together appears to produce a synergistic effect on process formation, as does the simultaneous addition of nerve growth factor and dBcAMP.
