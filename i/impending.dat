5|$|Dilipa– King of Ayodhya and {{the father}} of Bhagirath and Anadamayi, Dilipa is obsessed about his looks and {{decaying}} body, and is black-mailed by Bhrigu in helping him in the <b>impending</b> war against Shiva.|$|E
5|$|In many {{versions}} of the tale, the omniscient Rama knows about Sita's <b>impending</b> abduction and creates Maya Sita. Such versions assert Rama's divine status, a departure from Valmiki's portrayal of Rama as a human hero.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch {{public was}} furious {{at what they}} {{believed}} a hostile German act, which caused German diplomats to spread rumors of an <b>impending</b> British invasion of the Netherlands to divert the unwanted attention.|$|E
5|$|The comet {{was also}} {{fertile ground for}} hoaxes. One that reached major {{newspapers}} claimed that the Sacred Followers, a supposed Oklahoma religious group, attempted to sacrifice a virgin {{to ward off the}} <b>impending</b> disaster, but were stopped by the police.|$|E
5|$|Thor, imprisoned {{on another}} world without Mjölnir, must outlive a gladiatorial duel against {{his old friend}} – the Hulk – in order to return to Asgard in time to stop the villainous Hela and the <b>impending</b> Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|Adidas {{have been}} the All Blacks' kit {{suppliers}} since 1999, taking over from Canterbury. In June 2017, after releasing a special edition jersey for the <b>impending</b> three tests against the British and Irish Lions, {{it was announced that}} the partnership between the All Blacks and Adidas had been extended to at least 2023.|$|E
5|$|All three {{gunpowder}} factories {{closed in}} 1934 {{due to the}} <b>impending</b> threat of World War II. Production was moved to Ardeer in Ayrshire, Scotland, and the munition industry around Faversham is now extinct. The town is now a harbour and market community; old sail-powered Thames barges are repaired, rebuilt and moored along the creekside.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{the attack}} was over, Giffen ordered his ships to cease zigzagging and {{continue}} towards Guadalcanal on the same course {{and at the same}} speed. Meanwhile, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft began dropping flares and floatlights to mark the course and speed of TF18 for the <b>impending</b> attack by Hagai's bombers.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{differences}} on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's {{study of the}} Campaign of 1815 and Wellington's famous 1842 essay in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment. Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an <b>impending</b> French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Kapoor {{spoke of}} his <b>impending</b> {{marriage}} to Mira Rajput, a student from New Delhi, who is 13 years his junior. The Times of India reported that Kapoor met Rajput through the religious group Radha Soami Satsang Beas. The couple married at a private ceremony in Gurgaon on 7 July 2015, and Rajput gave birth to their daughter, Misha, on 26 August 2016.|$|E
5|$|In Sydney, fear of an <b>impending</b> Japanese {{invasion}} caused {{people to}} move west; housing prices in the Eastern Suburbs dropped, while those beyond the Blue Mountains rose significantly. The attack also led to {{a significant increase in}} the membership of volunteer defence organisations, and strengthening of defences in Sydney Harbour and Port Newcastle.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{attempts}} to avoid running into Wesley Snipes (Sheen) after {{they fail to}} hit it off in their first encounter, but fate seems to want them together. At the same time, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) deals with the <b>impending</b> purchase of NBC. Finally, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) does damage control after his former nanny publishes a tell-all book.|$|E
5|$|Macbeth {{eventually}} {{sees that}} Banquo {{can no longer}} be trusted to aid him in his evil, and considers his friend a threat to his newly acquired throne. Thus he has him murdered. Banquo's ability to live on in different ways is another oppositional force, in this case to Macbeth's <b>impending</b> death. His spirit lives on in Fleance, his son, and in his ghostly presence at the banquet.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was {{complimentary}} of {{his opponents}} afterwards and was pleased there were no new injuries to report. Opposing manager Arsène Wenger praised Fàbregas's performance and reiterated his desire to keep Vieira at Arsenal, after speculation regarding the player's <b>impending</b> transfer to Real Madrid.|$|E
5|$|Many {{details of}} West Corums post-Navy career are unknown, but {{mentions}} in shipping reports in contemporary newspapers offer hints at her activities. The New York Times reports on West Corums <b>impending</b> arrival from Bordeaux in October 1919, and from Antwerp in May and August 1920. By November 1920, West Corum had apparently begun sailing to Argentine ports.|$|E
5|$|Morton also {{believed}} that war was inevitable and began to prepare the state for its outbreak during his early tenure as governor. Morton appointed men to positions in state government who opposed any compromise with the southern states. He also established without legislative permission a state arsenal, where up to 700 men produced ammunition, and made many other preparations for the <b>impending</b> war.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{to merge}} with Union Temple (the {{successor}} to Temple Israel) were started in 1925. A confirmation vote eventually passed, and the <b>impending</b> merger was announced in the Brooklyn Eagle. However, younger congregants feared a loss of identity, and forced a withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{from various}} {{disciplines}} quickly dismissed predictions of concomitant cataclysmic events as they arose. Professional Mayanist scholars stated that no extant classic Maya accounts forecast <b>impending</b> doom, {{and that the}} idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented Maya history and culture, while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as pseudoscience, easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Amy {{reconcile}} {{and return}} to the TARDIS after saying their goodbyes. Amy is about to tell the Doctor of her <b>impending</b> wedding when she is interrupted by a call to the TARDIS from Winston Churchill, who is face-to-face with a Dalek.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began with}} the French army outnumbered. Napoleon had some 72,000 men and 157 guns for the <b>impending</b> battle, with about 7,000 troops under Davout still far to {{the south in the}} {{direction}} of Vienna. The Allies had about 85,000 soldiers, seventy percent of them Russian, and 318 guns.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was therefore spurred {{in part by a}} desire to form a stronger political current, rather than being seen as the communist opposition to the Comintern and the Soviet Union. Trotsky believed that its formation was all the more urgent for the role he saw it playing in the <b>impending</b> World War.|$|E
5|$|The {{main title}} music, a tense, hurtling piece, {{sets the tone}} of <b>impending</b> violence, and returns three times on the soundtrack. Though nothing {{shocking}} occurs during the first 15–20 minutes of the film, the title music remains in the audience's mind, lending tension to these early scenes. Herrmann also maintains tension through the slower moments in the film {{through the use of}} ostinato.|$|E
5|$|The ship's keel {{was laid}} down in 1843 at the New York Navy Yard; she was {{launched}} on 27 June 1846, and commissioned on 6 November, with Captain Samuel Livingston Breese in command. Her construction was accelerated so she would be complete for the <b>impending</b> war with Mexico. Although she could carry 22 guns, Albany sailed with only 20.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 28 January, the Coalition {{received}} {{a number of}} warnings suggesting an <b>impending</b> Iraqi offensive. The Coalition was flying two brand-new E-8A Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) aircraft, which picked up the deployment and movement of Iraqi forces to the area opposite of Khafji. Observation posts 2, 7 and 8 also detected heavy Iraqi reconnoitering along the border, and their small teams of air-naval gunfire liaison Marines called in air and artillery strikes throughout the day. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Barry, commander of the forward headquarters of the 1st Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group, sent warnings about an <b>impending</b> attack to Central Command. CentCom leaders were too preoccupied with the air campaign to heed them however, and so the Iraqi operation came as a surprise.|$|E
5|$|With all the {{evidence}} pointing to an <b>impending</b> Turkish assault, the ANZAC troops were ordered to stand-to at 03:00, half an hour earlier than normal, and they improvised defences by throwing out rolls of barbed wire on rests {{to the front of}} their lines.|$|E
5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony was}} held by New York City Mayor John Hylan on April 14, 1923 in Bay Ridge and in Staten Island on July 19. Headings were dug and tunneling shafts were sunk at 68th Street and Shore Road in Brooklyn (the Shore Road Shaft), and underneath the Saint George Terminal in Staten Island (the South Street Shaft), costing a total of $1 million. In addition, {{in preparation for the}} tunnel, the SIRT purchased one hundred ME-1 subway cars built to BMT specifications and electrified its three-passenger branches. The <b>impending</b> completion of the tunnel also sparked real estate interests in Staten Island.|$|E
5|$|A hairy and fiery star having {{then made}} its {{appearance}} for several days, the mathematicians declared {{that there would}} follow grievous pestilence, dearth and some great calamity. Calixtus, to avert the wrath of God, ordered supplications that if evils were <b>impending</b> for the human race He would turn all upon the Turks, the enemies of the Christian name. He likewise ordered, to move God by continual entreaty, that notice should be given by the bells to call the faithful at midday to aid by their prayers those engaged in battle with the Turk.|$|E
5|$|A lead coffin in a rock-cut grave was {{discovered}} {{at a site}} adjacent to the Fosse Way in 1988. This discovery, and the <b>impending</b> commercial development of the site by the landowner, Showerings, led archaeologists to undertake more extensive excavations in the 1990s. The grave {{was part of a}} larger cemetery which contained 17 burials lying on a rough east-west alignment, indicating probable Christian adherence. Two other, smaller, cemeteries contained graves aligned north-south, possibly signifying pagan religious practices. One burial was in a substantial stone coffin which had been positioned beneath a mausoleum, the foundations of which remained.|$|E
5|$|A {{small ship}} travels to a {{rotating}} space station. Aboard the station, {{a group of}} starfish-like beings discuss how to warn humans of an <b>impending</b> disaster, deciding on contacting Japanese scientist Dr. Kumara. Meanwhile, flying saucers are spotted over the skies of Tokyo, baffling scientists. A journalist tries to get a statement from Dr. Kumara about the sightings, but Kumara replies {{that there is not}} enough evidence to formulate a hypothesis. At an observatory, Professor Isobe spots an object in his telescope apparently releasing smaller objects.|$|E
5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to lurk {{in areas that are}} concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of <b>impending</b> danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's <b>impending</b> doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, with the Confederate victory at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky, on August 30, 1862, rumors of an <b>impending</b> Confederate attack on Cincinnati began to circulate. Richmond was one hundred miles to the south of Cincinnati, and no organized Union troops lay between the two cities. An attack by Confederate Colonel John Hunt Morgan, who had led his cavalry on a raid behind Union lines in Kentucky the previous month, was also feared. On September 2, the men of Cincinnati were organized into work units to build fortifications around the city.|$|E
5|$|Actual or <b>impending</b> airway {{obstruction}} is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
5|$|After Alex {{realizes that}} Clear is {{actually}} next to die {{he goes to}} her house to save her. Due to her house experiencing short-circuits, she attempted to escape with her car. Despite the car being trapped by livewires, Alex manages to save her and they both survive the ordeal. Months later in Paris, Alex has doubts about their triumph over Death. Noticing signs of <b>impending</b> doom Clear saves Alex from a speeding bus but they both witness Carter's demise by a falling sign.|$|E
5|$|After Dutch forces massacred 10,000 ethnic Chinese in Batavia (now Jakarta), a {{group of}} {{survivors}} led by Khe Pandjang headed east for Semarang. Despite being warned of the <b>impending</b> uprising, {{the head of the}} Dutch East India Company's military Bartholomeus Visscher ignored his advisers and did not prepare reinforcements. As the situation developed, the court of , Sunan of Mataram, decided to tentatively support the Chinese while seemingly helping the Dutch.|$|E
5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the <b>impending</b> birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
