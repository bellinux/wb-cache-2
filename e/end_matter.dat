50|$|Modern bound {{books are}} {{organized}} {{according to a}} particular format called the book's layout. Although there is great variation in layout, modern books tend to adhere to as set of rules with regard to what {{the parts of the}} layout are and what their content usually includes. A basic layout will include a front cover, a back cover, and the book's content which is called its body copy or content pages. The front cover often bears the book's title (and subtitle, if any) and the name of its author or editor(s). The inside front cover page is usually left blank in both hardcover and paperback books. The next section, if present, is the book's front matter, which includes all textual material after the front cover but not part of the book's content— such things as a forward, a dedication, and a table of contents as well as publisher data such as the book's edition or printing number and place of publication. Between the body copy and the back cover goes the <b>end</b> <b>matter</b> which would include any indices, sets of tables, or diagrams, glossaries, or lists of cited works (though an edited book with multiple contributing authors usually places cited works {{at the end of each}} authored chapter). The inside back cover page, like that inside the front cover, is usually blank. The back cover itself is the usual place for the book's ISBN, and maybe a photograph of the author(s)/ editor(s), perhaps with a short introduction to them. Also here often appear plot summaries, barcodes, and excerpted reviews of the book.|$|E

40|$|Commissioned by Artangel, London, and BBC Radio 4, {{this project}} {{combines}} an audio walk and installation The Loss Adjusters {{on the island}} of Portland (Dorset, 2015) with an authored publication <b>End</b> <b>Matter</b> (Book Works, London 2015) and a broadcast The Quarryman’s Daughters for Radio 4 (May 2015). Palmer was resident on Portland in order to generate the work that evolved through exploratory walks across the intensively quarried landscape, photography, the collection of environmental and archival audio recordings, and library based research into the island’s complex social and industrial history. Accreted overlaid narrative timelines were developed to parallel the geological layers in the stone. The characters were used to embody ideas and inhabit arguments such as The Loss Adjusters who attempt to calculate the monumental scale of loss from the island. Specific items were identified and gathered to furnish The Loss Adjuster’s offices. The narratives articulate sculpture’s physical presence as being in a dialectical relationship with absence; they extrapolate the idea that the island {{is in the process of}} being carved out, creating an inverted and unstable form, the antithesis of monuments made from Portland stone in many cities. The audience, who visited Portland to listen to the audio aspects of the storytelling, entered The Loss Adjusters’ offices before walking through the landscape, into the quarries and across the stone.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the artistic-writing career of Ippolito Ferrarese a storyteller who lived and worked between Venice and many other Central-Northern Italian cities in the early 16 th century. He seems to have commissioned a large number of editions, mainly to some Venetian printers who had contacts with street artist (Guglielmo da Fontaneto, Venturino Ruffinelli, Francesco Bindoni and Maffeo Pasini). Most of these works are poetry collections, including Ariostean verses, and popular texts in small-sized, illustrated editions, sometimes with no short titles. A review of the references and front and <b>end</b> <b>matter</b> discovers the authors of many of such editions sine notis.

40|$|Extract] Five {{significant}} {{editions of}} Evelyn Waugh's Edmund Champion- a superb biography of an eloquent and nonchalantly brave Jesuit priest executed under Elizabeth I - {{appeared during the}} author's lifetime. Each new edition involved corrections, deletions or additions, whether to the text, Notes, List of Works Consulted or {{to the front and}} <b>end</b> <b>matter.</b> But the changes are strangely inconsistent, and the reasons for them, and who originated them, have been obscure, challenging bibliographers. Why is the Second [British] Edition of 1947 so different from the American Edition of 1946 ? Was it Waugh or his publishers who insisted on major changes, such as the removal of notes and bibliography? And do the changes signal an altered conception {{of the nature of the}} biography? Edmund Campion is perforce a work of history as well as biography, but the Elizabethan history in which it embeds the narrative of Campion's life is confrontationally revisionist. Scholars, aware of the controversy surrounding the history, and seeking the sources on which Waugh silently drew, may find the removal of Notes and List of Works Consulted, and the historical mistakes left uncorrected, problematic. Moreover, a prospective editor must face the fact that errors and omissions persist in the last edition to leave Waugh's hands. What should a new edition look like...|$|E

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{the debate on}} the ontology of spacetime had only a philosophical significance, since, from a physical point of view, General Relativity has been made "immune" to the consequences of the "Hole Argument" simply by reducing the subject to the assertion that solutions of Einstein equations which are mathematically different and related by an active diffeomorfism are physically equivalent. From a technical point of view, the natural reading of the consequences of the "Hole Argument” has always been to go further and say that the mathematical representation of spacetime in General Relativity inevitably contains a “superfluous structure” brought to light by the gauge freedom of the theory. This position of apparent split between the philosophical outcome and the physical one has been corrected thanks to a meticulous and complicated formal analysis of the theory in a fundamental and recent (2006) work by Luca Lusanna and Massimo Pauri entitled “Explaining Leibniz equivalence as difference of non-inertial appearances: dis-solution of the Hole Argument and physical individuation of point-events”. The main result of this article is that of having shown how, from a physical point of view, point-events of Einstein empty spacetime, in a particular class of models considered by them, are literally identifiable with the autonomous degrees of freedom of the gravitational field (the Dirac observables, DO). In the light of philosophical considerations based on realism assumptions of the theories and entities, the two authors then conclude by saying that spacetime point-events have a degree of "weak objectivity", since they, depending on a NIF (non-inertial frame), unlike the points of the homogeneous newtonian space, are plunged in a rich and complex non-local holistic structure provided by the “ontic part” of the metric field. Therefore according to the complex structure of spacetime that General Relativity highlights and within the declared limits of a methodology based on a Galilean scientific representation, we can certainly assert that spacetime has got "elements of reality", but the inevitably relational elements that are in the physical detection of point-events in the vacuum of matter (highlighted by the “ontic part” of the metric field, the DO) are closely dependent on the choice of the global spatiotemporal laboratory where the dynamics is expressed (NIF). According to the two authors, a peculiar kind of structuralism takes shape: the point structuralism, with common features both of the absolutist and substantival tradition and of the relationalist one. The intention of this thesis is that of proposing a method of approaching the problem that is, at least at the beginning, independent from the previous ones, that is to propose an approach based on the possibility of describing the gravitational field at three distinct levels. In other words, keeping the results achieved by the work of Lusanna and Pauri in mind and following their underlying philosophical assumptions, we intend to partially converge to their structuralist approach, but starting from what we believe is the "foundational peculiarity" of General Relativity, which is that characteristic inherent in the elements that constitute its formal structure: its essentially geometric nature as a theory considered regardless of the empirical necessity of the measure theory. Observing the theory of General Relativity from this perspective, we can find a "triple modality" for describing the gravitational field that is essentially based on a geometric interpretation of the spacetime structure. The gravitational field is now "visible" no longer in terms of its autonomous degrees of freedom (the DO), which, in fact, do not have a tensorial and, therefore, nor geometric nature, but it is analyzable through three levels: a first one, called the potential level (which the theory identifies with the components of the metric tensor), a second one, known as the connections level (which in the theory determine the forces acting on the mass and, as such, offer a level of description related to the one that the newtonian gravitation provides in terms of components of the gravitational field) and, finally, a third level, that of the Riemann tensor, which is peculiar to General Relativity only. Focusing from the beginning on what is called the "third level" seems to present immediately a first advantage: to lead directly to a description of spacetime properties in terms of gauge-invariant quantites, which allows to "short circuit" the long path that, in the treatises analyzed, leads to identify the "ontic part” of the metric field. It is then shown how to this last level it is possible to establish a “primitive level of objectivity” of spacetime in terms of the effects that matter exercises in extended domains of spacetime geometrical structure; these effects are described by invariants of the Riemann tensor, in particular of its irreducible part: the Weyl tensor. The convergence towards the affirmation by Lusanna and Pauri that the existence of a holistic, non-local and relational structure from which the properties quantitatively identified of point-events depend (in addition to their own intrinsic detection), even if it is obtained from different considerations, is realized, in our opinion, in the assignment of a crucial role to the degree of curvature of spacetime that is defined by the Weyl tensor even in the case of empty spacetimes (as in the analysis conducted by Lusanna and Pauri). In the <b>end,</b> <b>matter,</b> regarded as the physical counterpart of spacetime curvature, whose expression is the Weyl tensor, changes the value of this tensor even in spacetimes without matter. In this way, going back to the approach of Lusanna and Pauri, it affects the DOs evolution and, consequently, the physical identification of point-events (as our authors claim). In conclusion, we think {{that it is possible to}} see the holistic, relational, and non-local structure of spacetime also through the "behavior" of the Weyl tensor in terms of the Riemann tensor. This "behavior" that leads to geometrical effects of curvature is characterized from the beginning by the fact that it concerns extensive domains of the manifold (although it should be pointed out that the values of the Weyl tensor change from point to point) by virtue of the fact that the action of matter elsewhere indefinitely acts. Finally, we think that the characteristic relationality of spacetime structure should be identified in this "primitive level of organization" of spacetime...|$|E
