5|$|It was {{originally}} envisaged {{that the first}} elections would be held on 1 November 1835, with the reformed town councils holding their first meetings on 9 November following. However, the process of dividing the boroughs into wards and preparing the burgess roll or <b>electoral</b> <b>register</b> was a lengthy one, and an Order in Council was made delaying the first elections to 26 December, with the new boroughs coming into formal existence on 1 January 1836.|$|E
5|$|The Conservatives {{remained}} in office {{because the new}} <b>electoral</b> <b>register</b> was not yet ready; neither party wished a poll under the old roll.

5|$|The {{electoral law}} {{provides}} that parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors {{are allowed to}} present lists of candidates. However, groupings of electors are required to secure at least the signature of 1 per 100 of the electors entered in <b>electoral</b> <b>register</b> of the constituency {{for which they are}} seeking election—0.1 per 100 and, at least, the signature of 500 electors, until 1985—. Also since 2011, parties, federations or coalitions who have not obtained a mandate in either House of Parliament at the preceding election are required to secure at least the signature of 0.1 per 100 of the electors entered in <b>electoral</b> <b>register</b> of the constituency for which they are seeking election. Electors are barred from signing for more than one list of candidates. Concurrently, parties and federations intending to enter in coalition to take part jointly at an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days from the election call.|$|E
5|$|There were, however, {{a number}} of irregularities. In the Toronto riding of St. Paul's, four Liberal workers were convicted of various {{offences}} for adding almost five hundred names to the <b>electoral</b> <b>register.</b> One of the four was also convicted for two counts of perjury. While the unsuccessful Liberal candidate, former MP James Rooney, was not charged, Ontario Chief Justice James Chalmers McRuer, who investigated the matter, doubted that {{this could have been}} done without the candidate's knowledge.|$|E
5|$|All officers, clerks, interpreters, {{candidates}} and candidates' agents at polling stations must maintain the secrecy of voting in stations. Before the poll is closed, {{they must not}} communicate to anyone the name of any elector who has not yet voted or his or her or identification number on the <b>electoral</b> <b>register.</b> They are prohibited from communicating information obtained during the counting of votes as to which candidate has been voted for in any particular ballot paper. Furthermore, no person is allowed {{to try to find}} out from within a polling station who a voter intends to vote for or has voted for, or to communicate with a voter after he has been given a ballot paper but before he has placed it in a ballot box.|$|E

5|$|During the {{election}} period, a candidate is {{not permitted to}} spend more than $600,000 or 30 cents for each person on the <b>electoral</b> <b>register,</b> whichever is the greater amount. For the 2017 election, {{based on the number of}} electors as at 28 August 2017, {{the election}} expenses limit was $754,982.40. It amounts to an illegal practice to pay to transport voters to or from the poll; or to pay a voter for the use of premises to display a notice, unless the voter is an advertising agent or the transaction is carried out in the ordinary course of business. It is also an illegal practice for a person to borrow or lend, hire or rent out, or use any motor vehicle to convey voters other than himself and his family members to or from the poll. Committing an illegal practice is a criminal offence, the penalty for which is a fine of up to $2,000 and disqualification for three years from being a voter or a candidate for Parliament or the office of President.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidates}} {{appeared in}} televised debates {{during which they}} discussed various topics. One of them were the rules governing the voting of non-resident nationals, which had been changed by the National Electoral Commission during the campaign. Before the campaign, non-resident nationals who wanted to cast their votes as absentee ballots had been obliged to request voting materials, but the Commission had introduced a new system in which such materials were sent to all non-residents entered in the <b>electoral</b> <b>register,</b> whether they had asked for them or not. Opposition parties, representing the left-wing of Slovenian politics, disliked this move because the record of voters' addresses was not always reliable, and also because the rules had been changed after the campaign had already started. They particularly opposed the change because voters from abroad seemed to favor right-wing parties, {{so that in the}} event of a very close ballot, votes from non-residents could tip the scale in favour of Peterle.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny– that is, a re-examination of the ballot papers– {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just because he or she was not qualified to be on the <b>electoral</b> <b>register,</b> and the returning officer's decision {{as to whether or not}} a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E
