40|$|International audienceThis study aims at {{investigating}} {{the effects of}} high voltage electrical discharges (HVED) on the aqueous extraction of polyphenols from grape pomace (Vitis vinifera L.) at constant temperature in the range 20 – 60 °C. HVED were applied on fresh, frozen-thawed and sulphured grape pomaces for 160 s and diffusion was then studied for 1 h. Then, the yield of extracted solutes <b>from</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>grape</b> pomace reached 70 % after 40 min. This yield represented {{more than twice the}} yield obtained after 240 min without HVED (Ysolutes ≈ 30 %). HVED also increased the yield of polyphenols (Ypolyphenols = 0. 44 ± 0. 07 %) after 1 h of extraction compared to that obtained after 4 h of extraction without HVED (Ypolyphenols = 0. 26 ± 0. 06 %). The yields of solutes and polyphenols increased with temperature. For the preservation of grape pomace, the addition of sulphur dioxide was better than freezing. Finally, we found that the extraction of solutes was satisfactorily described by the well known Peleg's model (R 2 > 0. 972) ...|$|R
40|$|Production of {{wine vinegar}} by fermenting dried grapes and rehydrating with tap water {{is not allowed}} by European Regulations. In this study we proved {{experimentally}} that δ 18 O analysis of beverage water, officially used to detect the watering of wine and rehydration of concentrated fruit juice, can also be applied to vinegar to detect this kind of fraud. We considered fourteen production chains from wine to the corresponding raw vinegar and diluted vinegar (6 % of acidity), and the official European wine databank established according to EU Reg. 555 / 2008. δ 18 O limit values of − 2 ‰ and − 5 ‰ were defined for raw and diluted vinegars produced <b>from</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>grapes.</b> Values lower than these limits indicate a significant addition {{of water to a}} starting matrix with a sugar concentration much higher than fresh grapes.

40|$|Wine quality {{depends on}} {{phenolic}} and aromatic compounds that are mainly located in skins and seeds of grapes {{and can be}} better extracted if suitable extraction technologies are applied. An increase in extractability has impact in the mouth feel, color and age ability of the wines. Using liquid or solid CO 2 {{is a way to}} promote the breakdown of the cells membranes and enhance extraction of these compounds and protecting grapes and wine from oxidation. The main goal was to test the impact of solid CO 2 addition to destemmed grapes with a new CO 2 dispenser equipment in order to freeze the berry skins and improve the phenolic extraction in an economic and sustainable way in cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir. The experiment designed for both cultivars was a treatment with CO 2 addition and a control without CO 2 addition each one with three replicates. Destemmed grapes submitted to carbonic snow reached temperature of the skins between − 1 and − 4 [*]°C during four minutes under equipment treatment. The consumption of carbon dioxide was estimated around 0. 3 (kg ⋅kg− 1) CO 2 per berries. Wines of Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir <b>from</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>grapes</b> and frozen grapes were made and were being compared in phenolic composition and sensory attributes...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest from retailers, industries and environmental associations in estimating the life cycle of greenhouse gases emitted in the atmosphere from everyday products and services, also known as carbon footprint (CF). Life cycle assessment (LCA) is the most common methodology used to evaluate the environmental impact of a product. This approach was largely used in many industrial sectors and was also recently applied to quantify the environmental impact of the agri-food chain. Within agri-food products, wine {{is one of the most}} analysed, both for its importance in economic production and in the world distribution market. The present study is a part of the Carbon Label Project carried out in the wine production chain in the Maremma rural district (Tuscany, Italy). The project assessed the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wine production for labelling purposes. Here, we evaluated the environmental performances of four high quality wines for carbon labelling. The international standards ISO 14040, ISO 14044, and the Product Category Rules (PCR) Wine <b>from</b> <b>Fresh</b> <b>Grapes</b> (except sparkling wine) and Grape Must for the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) certification, specifically for Climate Declaration, were used in order to carry out our analyses. The functional unit (FU) used here was one 0. 75 L bottle of wine. The system boundaries were set from the vineyard planting to the distribution and waste disposal. The global warming potential (GWP) of four investigated wines was found to lie between 0. 6 and 1. 3 kg CO 2 -eq. /bottle, showing a value comparable with literature. With all the four wines analysed, the agricultural phase covered, on average, 22 % of the total GWP/bottle, while the main impact was in the production of the glass bottle. The results showed that the vineyard-planting phase has a significant impact on the wine CF, thus it has to be considered in the life cycle, while in literature it is frequently omitted. On the contrary, the pre-production phase did not present a relevant impact. The use of nitrogen fertilisers, the grapes' yield and N 2 O emissions were the parameters that mostly affected the carbon footprint in the agricultural phase, as underlined by the sensitivity analysis...|$|E

40|$|<b>Fresh</b> <b>grapes</b> and grape products, such as grape {{wine and}} grape juice, were {{analyzed}} for proanthocyanidins (PACs) using liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (MS) detection. PACs were successfully separated and analyzed {{on the basis}} of their protonated molecules, allowing the identification of PACs in different degrees of polymerization from monomers to oligomers (up to 7 units), and in various isomeric forms. Using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with MS detection, the PAC monomers, (+) -catechin (C), (-) -epicatechin (EC), (-) -catechin gallate (CG), and (-) -epicatechin gallate (ECG), were successfully quantified using selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Standard curves were fitted for each PAC ranging from 43. 8 to 5600 ng/mL for C, from 42. 2 to 5400 ng/mL for EC, from 36. 7 to 4700 ng/mL for CG, and from 39. 8 to 5100 ng/mL for ECG. Good linearity (r 2 > 0. 999) was achieved for each analyte. The accuracy and precision (RSD) were within 10 % (n = 8) at the limit of detection. This method allows direct quantification of monomeric PACs in <b>fresh</b> <b>grapes</b> and grape-derived products. Additionally, flow injection analysis (FIA) was applied to estimate the concentration levels of PAC oligomers by comparing their FIA-MS peak areas, which were well correlated (r 2 = 0. 936) to the total concentrations of PAC monomers.
