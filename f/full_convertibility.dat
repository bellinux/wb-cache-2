40|$|Bibliography: pages 157 - 165. This thesis {{analyses}} the impediments of inconvertible currencies on intra-regional trade {{within the}} Eastern and Southern African region. Currency inconvertibility is a non-tariff trade barrier which limits and distorts international trade expansion. Therefore, alternative arrangements {{that may be}} used in order to remedy this problem are considered. Exchange rate misalignment is identified as a major cause of currency inconvertibility. It is shown that the implementation of macroeconomic policies and exchange rate regimes which are not complementary cause exchange rate misalignment resulting in balance of payments disequilibria leading to currency inconvertibility. Since the preconditions for transformation to <b>full</b> currency <b>convertibility</b> have not been met by most countries in the region this thesis suggests a mechanism that will enable the use of local currencies for intra-regional trade (partial currency convertibility). The most viable arrangement under the prevailing conditions in the Eastern and Southern African region is the reserve fund to which member countries contribute a fraction of their international reserves. This contribution will be determined according to the levels of intra-regional trade in which they engage. This arrangement will guarantee that even if a member state cannot honour its payments' obligation {{it will be able to}} draw on the facility to make payment. The advantages of this facility are that it will guarantee that payments for intra-regional trade will be made and that the contributions by member countries will be more affordable than the other arrangements as well as its potential for assisting in creating closer economic relations in the region. The thesis concludes, however, that member countries should be encouraged to move towards <b>full</b> currency <b>convertibility</b> and hence an arrangement for purposes of intraregional currency convertibility should be strictly transitionary...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} achieving <b>full</b> <b>convertibility</b> for the Chinese currency, Renminbi (RMB), {{and its impact on}} the economies of both mainland China and Hong Kong.

There still exist various extremely strict restrictions on capital/financial account convertibility in China. There is still a long way to go before these restrictions can be removed completely. China¡¦s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) will surely drive the course of Renminbi¡¦s <b>full</b> <b>convertibility.</b> However, the Renminbi may not become a fully convertible currency within the five years after China¡¦s accession to the WTO.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} costs and {{benefits}} of portfolio investment versus foreign direct investment (FDI) in a comparative study between China and the US. Recently, China‟s authorities have announced a plan to make the Reminbi fully convertible in the near future.

However, this raises the questions of whether or not the <b>full</b> <b>convertibility</b> benefits China.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{launch of}} the “QFII (Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor) ” scheme is a milestone in China’s financial sector reform and opening up, likely to herald broader capital account liberalization ahead. However, the recent surge in capital inflows has contributed to a credit boom, giving rise to concerns about overheating and shedding spotlight on China’s de facto currency peg. The evidence of “hot money ” inflows further discredits the effectiveness of China’s existing system of capital control. Instead of moving towards greater exchange rate flexibility, the Chinese authorities have responded by stepping up sterilized intervention, easing restrictions on selected capital outflows, and tightening inward portfolio investment. Going forward the greater openness of China’s economy will almost certainly generate increased tensions with the country’s closed capital account.

Computed results show that the packet error rate (PER) and the bit error rate (BER) performance are limited by a signal spontaneous beat noise and crosstalk. The convolutional coding is proposed to be implemented in the multi-hop optical networks in order to improve the BER/PER performances. Results with convolutional coding show that there is a considerable improvement in network performance due to {{an increase in the number}} of traversable hops from a given transmitter power at a given BER/PER. This improvement is observed in the multi-hop optical network with and without wavelength conversion.
