5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingolipids {{are involved}} in the <b>intestinal</b> uptake of cholesterol. Studies in adult rodents have shown that milk sphingomyelin could lower the <b>intestinal</b> absorption of cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. <b>Intestinal</b> cholesterol absorption in adult rodents consuming a high fat diet was limited by sphingomyelin supplementation. Milk sphingomyelin and other phospholipids with high affinity for cholesterol could limit the micellar solubility of <b>intestinal</b> cholesterol, thereby limiting the cholesterol uptake by the enterocyte. Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol in adult rodents fed with Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced steatosis. Dietary sphingolipids also lowers hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels in adult rodents partly by modulating hepatic gene expression.|$|E
5|$|MFGM {{phospholipid}} components such as phosphatidylcholine {{are a key}} constituent of the <b>intestinal</b> mucus barrier, {{and therefore}} may contribute to <b>intestinal</b> defense against invasive pathogens. Sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin, {{are present in the}} apical membrane of the gut epithelia, and are also important for maintaining membrane structure, modulating growth factor receptors, and serving competitive binding inhibitors for microorganisms, microbial toxins, and viruses. Gangliosides are also present in <b>intestinal</b> mucosa and may possibly contribute to improved gut microflora and antibacterial defense.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that Andalusians {{experience}} ischaemic (reduced blood flow) diseases of the small intestine at a rate significantly higher than other breeds; and stallions had higher numbers of inguinal hernias, with risk for occurrence 30 times greater than other breeds. At the same time, they also showed a lower incidence of large <b>intestinal</b> obstruction. In {{the course of the}} study, Andalusians also showed the highest risk of laminitis as a medical complication related to the <b>intestinal</b> issues.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{consumption}} of cabbage {{may lead to}} increased <b>intestinal</b> gas which causes bloating and flatulence due to the trisaccharide raffinose, which the human small intestine cannot digest.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} {{that in some}} people, development of schizophrenia is related to <b>intestinal</b> tract dysfunction such as seen with non-celiac gluten sensitivity or abnormalities in the <b>intestinal</b> flora. A subgroup of persons with schizophrenia present an immune response to gluten different from that found in people with celiac, with elevated levels of certain serum biomarkers of gluten sensitivity such as anti-gliadin IgG or anti-gliadin IgA antibodies.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} {{passerine}} birds, parasites are common. 88% of common blackbirds {{were found to}} have <b>intestinal</b> parasites, most frequently Isospora and Capillaria species. and more than 80% had haematozoan parasites (Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma species).|$|E
5|$|Phosphate. PTH is {{the major}} {{regulator}} of serum phosphate concentrations via actions on the kidney. It is an inhibitor of proximal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus. Through activation of vitamin D the absorption (<b>intestinal)</b> of Phosphate is increased.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibiotics}} neomycin and metronidazole {{are other}} antibiotics {{used to treat}} hepatic encephalopathy. The rationale of their use {{was the fact that}} ammonia and other waste products are generated and converted by <b>intestinal</b> bacteria, and killing these bacteria would reduce the generation of these waste products. Neomycin was chosen because of its low <b>intestinal</b> absorption, as neomycin and similar aminoglycoside antibiotics may cause hearing loss and kidney failure if used by injection. Later studies showed that neomycin was indeed absorbed when taken by mouth, with resultant complications. Metronidazole, similarly, is less commonly used because prolonged use can cause nerve damage, in addition to gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the pancreas problems, people with cystic fibrosis experience more heartburn, <b>intestinal</b> blockage by intussusception, and constipation. Older individuals with CF may develop distal <b>intestinal</b> obstruction syndrome when thickened feces cause <b>intestinal</b> blockage.|$|E
25|$|Complications {{of ovarian}} cancer can include spread of the cancer to other organs, {{progressive}} function loss of various organs, ascites, and <b>intestinal</b> obstructions, which can be fatal. <b>Intestinal</b> obstructions in multiple sites {{are the most common}} proximate cause of death. <b>Intestinal</b> obstruction in ovarian cancer can either be a true obstruction, where tumor blocks the <b>intestinal</b> lumen, or a pseudo-obstruction, when tumor prevents normal peristalsis. Continuous accumulation of ascites can be treated by placing a drain that can be self-drained.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of colics {{requiring}} surgery, survival rates are best improved by quick recognition of colic and immediate surgical referral, rather than {{waiting to see if}} the horse improves, which only increases the extent of <b>intestinal</b> compromise. Survival rates are higher in surgical cases that do not require resection and anastomosis. 90% of large <b>intestinal</b> colic surgeries that are not due to volvulus, and 20–80% of large colon volvuluses, are discharged; while 85–90% of non strangulating small <b>intestinal</b> lesions, and 65–75% of strangulating <b>intestinal</b> lesions are discharged. 10–20% of small <b>intestinal</b> surgical cases require a second surgery, while only 5% of large <b>intestinal</b> cases do so. Horses that survive colic surgery have a high rate of return to athletic function. According to one study, approximately 86% of horses discharged returned to work, and 83.5% returned to same or better performance.|$|E
25|$|Gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus, {{commonly known}} as bloat, is a serious condition in which the stomach swells with air (gastric dilatation), sometimes twisting on itself (volvulus). Deep-chested breeds are at {{a higher risk of}} bloating. Factors that predispose dogs to this condition are <b>intestinal</b> foreign bodies, <b>intestinal</b> cancer, intussusception, and other <b>intestinal</b> diseases. It has a poor prognosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intestinal</b> {{stem cells}} divide {{continuously}} throughout life {{and use a}} complex genetic program to produce the cells lining {{the surface of the}} small and large intestines. <b>Intestinal</b> stem cells reside near the base of the stem cell niche, called the crypts of Lieberkuhn. <b>Intestinal</b> stem cells are probably the source of most cancers of the small intestine and colon.|$|E
25|$|Differentiation between {{proximal}} enteritis {{and small}} <b>intestinal</b> obstruction {{is important to}} ensure correct treatment, and can be assisted {{with the help of}} ultrasound. Horses with small <b>intestinal</b> obstruction will usually have an <b>intestinal</b> diameter of -10nbsp&cm with a wall thickness of 3-5mm. Horses with proximal enteritis usually have an <b>intestinal</b> diameter that is narrower, but wall thickness is often greater than 6mm, containing a hyperechoic or anechoic fluid, with normal, increased, or decreased peristalsis. However, obstructions that have been present for some time may present with thickened walls and distention of the intestine.|$|E
25|$|Recurrent <b>intestinal</b> {{bleeding}} {{is fairly}} common. It originates from telangiectatic small {{blood vessels in}} the <b>intestinal</b> mucosa. Additional findings in some individuals are portal hypertension and liver failure.|$|E
25|$|Cancers (neoplasia) {{other than}} lipoma are {{relatively}} rare causes of colic. Cases {{have been reported}} with <b>intestinal</b> cancers including <b>intestinal</b> lymphosarcoma, leiomyoma, and adenocarcinoma, stomach cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma, and splenic lymphosarcoma.|$|E
25|$|The {{utility of}} CRP in {{differentiating}} inflammatory diseases (including inflammatory bowel disease, <b>intestinal</b> lymphoma, <b>intestinal</b> tuberculosis, and Behcet's syndrome) {{has been investigated}} and compared to other inflammatory biomarkers, such as ESR and WBC.|$|E
25|$|In {{extreme cases}} of <b>intestinal</b> infestation, the mass and {{volume of the}} worms may cause the outer layers of the <b>intestinal</b> wall, such as the muscular layer, to tear. This may lead to peritonitis, volvulus, and {{gangrene}} of the intestine.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of whole}} bone creates {{a risk of}} dental fractures, <b>intestinal</b> obstruction, gastroenteritis, and <b>intestinal</b> perforations. Wolf care {{managers}} questioned {{on the topic of}} feeding bones identified the presence of animal hide with hair as offering some protection from <b>intestinal</b> perforation in the wild. An analysis of the skulls of African wild dogs showed that the natural diet of wild carnivores does not prevent them from suffering the same oral disease as their domestic counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Small <b>intestinal</b> volvulus {{is thought}} to be caused by a change in local peristalsis, or due to a lesion that the {{mesentery}} may twist around (such as an ascarid impaction), and usually involves the distal jejunum and ileum.w It {{is one of the most}} common causes of small <b>intestinal</b> obstruction in foals, possibly because of a sudden change to a bulkier foodstuff. Animals present with acute and severe signs of colic, and multiple distended loops of small intestine, usually seen radiographically in a foal. Small <b>intestinal</b> volvulus often occurs secondary to another disease process in adult horses, where small <b>intestinal</b> obstruction causes distention and then rotation around the root of the mesentery. Surgery is required to resect nonviable sections of bowel, and prognosis is correlated to the length of bowel involved, with animals with greater than 50% of small <b>intestinal</b> involvement having a grave prognosis.|$|E
25|$|The <b>intestinal</b> phase has two parts, the {{excitatory}} and the inhibitory. Partially digested food {{fills the}} duodenum. This triggers <b>intestinal</b> gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.|$|E
25|$|Certain spices {{have been}} {{reported}} to counteract the production of <b>intestinal</b> gas, most notably the closely related cumin, coriander, caraway, fennel and others such as ajwain, turmeric, asafoetida (hing), epazote, and kombu kelp (a Japanese seaweed). Most starches, including potatoes, corn, noodles, and wheat, produce gas as they are broken down in the large intestine. <b>Intestinal</b> gas can be reduced by fermenting the beans, and making them less gas-inducing, or by cooking them in the liquor from a previous batch. Some legumes also stand up to prolonged cooking, which can help break down the oligosaccharides into simple sugars. On the other hand, fermented bean products such as miso are less likely to produce as much <b>intestinal</b> gas. Fermentative lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum reduce flatulence in human <b>intestinal</b> tract.|$|E
25|$|Barrier Disruption: In {{isolates}} from Blastocystis sp. subtype 4, {{study has}} demonstrated that Blastocystis {{has the ability to}} alter the arrangement of F-actin in <b>intestinal</b> epithelial cells. Actin filaments are important in stabilizing tight junctions; they in turn stabilize the barrier, which is a layer of cells, between the <b>intestinal</b> epithelial cells and the <b>intestinal</b> content. The parasite causes the actin filaments to rearrange, and so compromising barrier function. This has been suggested to contribute to the diarrheal symptoms sometimes observed in Blastocystis patients.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intestinal</b> pseudo-obstruction is a {{syndrome}} {{caused by}} a malformation of the digestive system, characterized by a severe impairment {{in the ability of}} the intestines to push and assimilate. Symptoms include daily abdominal and stomach pain, nausea, severe distension, vomiting, heartburn, dysphagia, diarrhea, constipation, dehydration and malnutrition. There is no cure for <b>intestinal</b> pseudo-obstruction. Different types of surgery and treatment managing life-threatening complications such as ileus and volvulus, <b>intestinal</b> stasis which lead to bacterial overgrowth, and resection of affected or dead parts of the gut may be needed. Many patients require parenteral nutrition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intestinal</b> worms cause {{varying degrees}} of discomfort.|$|E
25|$|Fasciolopsiasis {{caused by}} <b>intestinal</b> fluke Fasciolopsis buski.|$|E
25|$|The {{partially}} digested and pulverized gizzard contents {{are passed}} into the intestine, where pancreatic and <b>intestinal</b> enzymes complete the digestion of the digestible food. The digestion products are then absorbed through the <b>intestinal</b> mucosa into the blood. The intestine ends via the large intestine in the vent or cloaca which serves as the common exit for renal and <b>intestinal</b> excrements {{as well as for}} the laying of eggs. However, unlike mammals, many birds do not excrete the bulky portions (roughage) of their undigested food (e.g. feathers, fur, bone fragments, and seed husks) via the cloaca, but regurgitate them as food pellets.|$|E
25|$|Backing up {{of fluid}} through the <b>intestinal</b> tract is usually {{due to a}} {{downstream}} obstruction, ileus, or proximal enteritis, and its presence usually indicates a small <b>intestinal</b> disease. Generally, the closer the obstruction is to the stomach, the greater amount of gastric reflux will be present. Approximately 50% of horses with gastric reflux require surgery.|$|E
25|$|Like {{loperamide}} {{and other}} opioids, morphine acts on the myenteric plexus in the <b>intestinal</b> tract, reducing gut motility, causing constipation. The gastrointestinal effects of morphine are mediated primarily by μ-opioid receptors in the bowel. By inhibiting gastric emptying and reducing propulsive peristalsis of the intestine, morphine decreases {{the rate of}} <b>intestinal</b> transit. Reduction in gut secretion and increased <b>intestinal</b> fluid absorption {{also contribute to the}} constipating effect. Opioids also may act on the gut indirectly through tonic gut spasms after inhibition of nitric oxide generation. This effect was shown in animals when a nitric oxide precursor, L-arginine, reversed morphine-induced changes in gut motility.|$|E
25|$|Several copper {{transporters}} {{have been}} identified that can move copper across cell membranes. Other <b>intestinal</b> copper transporters may exist. <b>Intestinal</b> copper uptake may be catalyzed by Ctr1. Ctr1 is expressed in all cell types so far investigated, including enterocytes, and it catalyzes the transport of Cu+1 across the cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{pancreatitis}} {{often results}} in <b>intestinal</b> malabsorption, and can result in diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Advantages of {{consuming}} fiber are {{the production of}} healthful compounds during the fermentation of soluble fiber, and insoluble fiber's ability (via its passive hygroscopic properties) to increase bulk, soften stool, and shorten transit time through the <b>intestinal</b> tract. A disadvantage of a diet high in fiber {{is the potential for}} significant <b>intestinal</b> gas production and bloating.|$|E
25|$|Three {{research}} groups have reported experimental infection of mice with Blastocystis produces <b>intestinal</b> inflammation.|$|E
25|$|On 14 June 2014, Cañas died of {{complications}} after <b>intestinal</b> surgery. He was 94.|$|E
