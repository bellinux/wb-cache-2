25|$|Tokelau {{has very}} scarce water {{resources}} {{and because there}} are no fresh water surfaces on any of the atolls, it is solely dependent on rainwater as its source of fresh water. In recent years, climate change has resulted in much lower rain levels with drought periods lasting for much longer. This has made Tokelau along with many other islands in the Pacific struggle to conserve and store water for individual use. In the past, countries such as New Zealand and the United States have had to send emergency water supplies to Tokelau because it {{was on the verge of}} running out entirely. Sanitation facilities are also said to be poorly designed and wasting precious supplies of fresh water through the <b>flushing</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Independence Avenue {{was finally}} {{extended}} westward through West Potomac Park in 1941 and 1942. For a decade, the NCPPC's proposal {{to extend the}} avenue westward had been opposed by the United States Department of the Interior, which opposed use of parkland for roads. There was also concern that the road would interfere with the Tidal Basin, which served as a <b>flushing</b> <b>system</b> of the downtown sewer network. But in October 1941, United States Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes removed {{his opposition to the}} extension, citing the need to accommodate defense workers needing to access the national capital. [...] The NCPPC voted on October 17, 1941, to extend the avenue west to the Potomac River. The agency was still unsure, however, whether to fill in the Tidal Basin's north bay, bridge it, or build a causeway. A bridge over the north bay of the Tidal Basin was the solution, and construction on the new Kutz Memorial Bridge began in June 1942.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} in {{response}} to the request to provide a recommendation for the prevention of possible microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) for the RHLWE (Replacement High-Level Waste Evaporator) <b>flush</b> water (FW) <b>system.</b> The recent occurrences of MIC at DWPF prompted HLWE to evaluate the possibility of MIC occurring in this 304 L stainless steel RHLWE <b>flush</b> water <b>system.</b> Concern was heightened {{by the fact that the}} well water used and the other conditions at H-Tank Farm are similar to those at DWPF. However, only one known leak has occurred in the existing 304 L evaporator <b>flush</b> water <b>systems</b> in either tank farm (in 1 H system), and no MIC Corrosion has been confirmed in the tank farm area. The design of the RHLWE <b>flush</b> water <b>system</b> (completed long before the occurrence of MIC at DWPF) was modeled after the existing evaporator <b>flush</b> water <b>systems</b> and did not specifically include MIC prevention considerations. Therefore, MIC prevention was not specifically considered during the design phase of this <b>flush</b> water <b>system.</b> The system is presently being installed. After an extensive evaluation, a task team concluded that the best biocide to prevent the occurrence of MIC would be NaOH at fairly low concentration. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is optimal in this application, because of its effectiveness, low cost, and familiarity to the Operations personnel (see Appendix A). However, it is the opinion of the task group that application should be withheld until MIC corrosion is demonstrated in the system...|$|R
