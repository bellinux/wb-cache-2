In this study, we investigate the preparation of a bone fixation device with additional bioactivity by adding nanoparticulate amorphous tricalcium phosphate (ATCP) to improve bonding to bone. Medically approved poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and spherical (ATCP) nanoparticles were blended directly or through a two-step approach, where ATCP was first dispersed in PLGA by solvent casting, <b>extruded</b> and hot <b>pressed</b> producing blocks and bone screws. The latter route yielded good particle dispersion while blending alone led to inhomogeneous mixtures. Samples were immersed in simulated body fluid and showed rapid formation of surface hydroxyapatite layers (examined by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy) already after 3 days, thus confirming very high bioactivity. Polymer degradation during processing and upon simulated implantation conditions was followed by gel permeation chromatography. The elevated temperature during extrusion was the strongest single factor contributing to PLGA degradation.

The microstructure and property changes, after vacuum sintering and hot extrusion, were investigated. The results showed clear evidence of porosity and a coarse lamellar microstructure in as-sintered Ti- 64 alloy billets. Tensile testing of as-sintered material gave yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and ductility values of 850 MPa, 985 MPa and 2 %, respectively.

For the first study, we used approximately 385 juvenile tilapia with mean weight 26 Â 6. 31 g, distributed in five conical tanks with a capacity of 90 L. The experimental design was a Latin square. The animals were submitted to the method of fecal collection by sedimentation. During the experimental period were measured average values of temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and electrical conductivity were measured. The IPS had the best CDaEB index of 84. 33 %. For CDaPB, {{there were no significant}} differences between treatments, with values above 90 %. The largest value of digestible energy (ED) was 4139 Kcal ED / kg for the IPS. To digestible protein (PD) IPS presented the value of 79. 11 %, followed by the FSB, and FSC FSP. After the stool collection period, fish were fed for 45 days for evaluation of hematological and biochemical parameters of tilapia. For blood tests, were captured at random eight fish weighing on average 94. 17 Â 8. 60 g. Through blood tests, there was a significant difference between treatments for hematological parameters of hemoglobin and hematocrit to biochemical parameters showed higher triglyceride levels in the analysis of basal diet. The second study aimed to evaluate the performance of tilapia when exposed to soy-based diets (White, IPS, and Conventional Soybean <b>extruded</b> and <b>pressed).</b> We used 200 tilapia with initial weight of 3. 6 g and total length averaging 5. 2 cm, distributed in 20 experimental cages, housed in a greenhouse. The distribution of treatments used was a fully cazualizado design with four treatments and five replicates for 60 days. Were prepared five isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets containing 28 % digestible protein and 3, 300 kcal ED / kg. At the end of the experiment, fish were weighed and measured individually, where he obtained the calculations of weight gain, feed conversion, feed efficiency, survival rate and condition factor. At the end of the experiment, there were no statistical differences in the composition of fish among treatments and productive performance. It follows that all foods have excellent CDa evaluated with values above 90 % protein digestibility. Derivatives of soy are foods high protein, with excellent rates of apparent availability of its nutrients. The soy-based diets do not cause harm to health of tilapia compared with the reference diet, and can be used as food in order to formulate least cost rations for flour in place of animal origin for this species, and that feeds the base of soy products do not cause damage to the performance of tilapia compared with the reference diet...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{the energy}} {{efficiency}} of the existing building stock is beneficial in terms of reducing both operational cost and environmental impact. Solid, load bearing masonry buildings comprise an appreciable part of the existing building stock, are valued for their durability and are often of historical significance, however their thermal performance is often poor. Thermal upgrades with interior insulation are usually considered risky as this lowers the drying potential of the wall enclosure which increases the moisture content of the masonry, possibly to damaging levels during freeze-thaw cycles. The current approach to assessing the suitability of brick for exterior use is based on acceptance criteria or a severe freeze-thaw test as prescribed by ASTM and CSA. The first method {{is based on an}} incomplete understanding of freeze-thaw physics. The second method subjects the bricks to a set of conditions that cannot encompass the highly variable range of in-service exposures. Past research indicates that rigid porous materials, such as brick and concrete, experience frost damage only if saturated beyond a fixed, critical degree of saturation. A more useful approach to assessing the risk of damage due to freeze-thaw would be to determine the critical degree of saturation of a material and then compare that to anticipated moisture loads under service conditions using computer modelling software such as WUFI. A test method was developed to determine the critical degree of saturation of a material requiring less than two weeks of testing by means of frost dilatometry. Representative brick were first sliced into 10 mm thick specimens. Material properties of the brick specimens were determined, including dry weight, dry density, porosity (determined by either boiling or vacuum saturation), water uptake coefficient (A-value), and initial length, to allow for computer modeling and analysis of results. The specimens were wetted to various degrees of saturation (based on either boil or vacuum saturation), sealed in a manner to ensure minimal moisture loss, and then subjected to at least six freeze-thaw cycles. The change in length of the specimens following freeze thaw testing was measured and the expansion, which in this study was expressed in terms of microstrain, plotted against degree of saturation. Any specimen that experienced expansion greater than that attributable to instrument error was considered damaged by frost. Determining the total open porosity of a material, necessary for measuring degree of saturation, is difficult due to close voids and trapped air in dead end pores. Boiling saturation and vacuum saturation are two methods commonly used to determine open porosity. For the size of specimens used in the test, almost all water absorption when using the boil method occurred during the first hour of boiling and first hour of soaking. The repeatability of boiling to determine total open porosity is low, with approximately 10 % variability experienced over three rounds of boiling. Specimens absorbed a greater or equal amount of moisture using the vacuum saturation method than the boiling saturation method, indicating that vacuum saturation is more effective at determining total open porosity. The repeatability of vacuum saturation is good with very little variability observed over 3 rounds. The benefit of boiling saturation is that its equipment requirements and procedure are simpler than that of vacuum saturation. Freeze-thaw cycling was carried out by immersing the sealed specimens in a liquid bath. The change in length was determined by measuring pins attached to the specimens with an outside digital micrometer with a ratchet stop. A combination of experimentation and computer modeling showed that the samples could be wetted to target moisture contents with excellent accuracy and that moisture redistributed evenly in less than 24 hours for most samples. The minimum required temperature of the freeze cycle was chosen to be less than - 12 °C, in order to freeze all water contained in pores with a radius of 10 nm and greater. It was determined, for the small specimen sizes used, that the cooling and warming phases should be at least one hour in duration to ensure that the specimens entirely freeze and thaw. Three sets of brick were subjected to the test to determine their critical degree of saturation: modern <b>extruded</b> brick, <b>pressed</b> brick from the 1950 s, and historic brick dating to the 1870 s. The older bricks experienced frost dilatation above 0. 25 and 0. 30 vacuum saturation respectively, with no damage evident below these thresholds. The modern extruded brick only experienced damage at 0. 87 of vacuum saturation and greater. Knowledge of the critical degree of saturation of a brick allows architects and engineers to pursue retrofit strategies that increase thermal performance without jeopardizing the durability of the material by creating the conditions that allow the moisture content to increase to dangerous levels...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, clay {{roof tiles}} are {{manufactured}} by pressing in 'open' moulds whereas in South East Asia 'closed' moulds are commonly used. The European products are more complex, having {{a greater degree}} of detail. Closed mould pressing could, however, be advantageous as it would minimise scrap recycling but the products would need to have equivalent or superior durability to existing tiles. The aim of this work was to investigate the feasibility of using a closed mould for the manufacture of European tiles by examining the relationship between the type of pressing and subsequent durability, in terms of resistance to repetitive freeze-thaw cycles. One specific clay type, the Marseille rose blend, was investigated over a range of forming water contents. Preliminary data relating to plasticity and friction were obtained through an empirical (Pfefferkorn) plasticity test, uniaxial compression of cylinders and friction ring experiments. Clay cylinders containing 16 - 21 wt % water were deformed at a compression rate of 240 mm/min. The yield stress was found to increase with decreasing moisture content. The plastic ranges of the stress-strain curves were well represented by a plastic deformation equation of uniaxial compression under sticking friction conditions. A laboratory-scale pressing rig was designed to make profiled specimens which would reproduce the essential features of a European tile. Comparison of the microstructures of the laboratory and factory samples showed that there was sufficient resemblance to validate the replication of the Marseille products in the laboratory tests. Bats of three moisture contents of 16. 4, 18. 4 and 20. 6 wt % and different geometries were pressed in open, partially closed and closed rubber lined resin moulds in a mechanical testing machine using a cross-head speed of 240 mm/min. This was lower than a typical pressing operation but the speed of pressing had been found to not be a significant variable over the range commonly encountered. Clay was trapped in the features as the mould closed and flowed mainly within the flat part of the samples during pressing. For the open and partially closed moulds excess material was extruded through the gaps at the sides, a process referred to as flashing. The shape of the load-displacement curves was characteristic of the stages of the pressing process. The stress-strain curves for the pressing in open moulds showed good qualitative agreement with the results from uniaxial compression of cylinders. The open porosity of the samples after firing was strongly related to the forming moisture content of the clay with the open porosity increasing with increasing water content. Comparison of <b>extruded</b> bats and <b>pressed</b> bars showed that the influence of the pressing processes was not significant. Likewise, in freeze-thaw testing, the effect of the moisture content was again the overriding parameter, with acceptable durability always being obtained from the lowest open porosity samples. Given the marginal differences, the pressing processes investigated in this study were assumed to be equivalent in terms {{of the quality of the}} samples produced. Thus, closed mould pressing is feasible but does not lead to product improvement and hence may not be economically viable...|$|R
40|$|Four alloys with nominal {{compositions}} Al- 8 Fe- 4 Ni, Al- 8 Fe- 4 Ni- 2, 5 Zr, Al- 8 Fe- 4 Ni- 2. 5 Zr- 1 Mo and Al- 8 Fe- 4 Ni- 2. 5 Zr- 2 V- 1 Mo (wt%) {{were produced}} {{in the form of}} wedge shaped ingots by chill casting in a copper mould and in powder form by high pressure gas atomisation using Helium as the atomising gas. Sub- 45, sub- 50 or + 50 - 100 mum powder size fractions were canned and degassed at 573 K. The first two alloys were consolidated by hot extrusion at 573 K and ER= 18 : 1 and 25 : 1. The third alloy could be extruded at 698 K and ER= 5 : 1 while the powders of the fourth alloy were hot pressed at 623 K because of difficulties with extrusion. The microstructures at the tips of the wedge castings could be related to those of the atomised powder particles. Rapid solidification suppressed the formation of Al 3 Fe, Al 12 Mo and A 111 V in the tips of the wedge castings and m powder particles up to 200 mum diameter, where the microstructures consisted only of a-Al and Al 9 FeNi, with some week evidence for possible formation of Ll 2 -Al 3 Zr in the larger powder particles. Two types of microstructures were observed in the powder particles: Zone A, consisting of mu-Al solid solution or microcellular mu-Al+Al 9 FeNi eutectic structures or Zone B consisting of mu -Al+Al 9 FeNi dendritic structures. The transition from Zone A to Zone B microstructres shifted to smaller powder particle sizes (from 20 mum to less than 10 mum) or smaller thickness (< 300 mum) of the wedge shaped ingots with increasing solute addition to the first alloy. In all cases the Al 9 FeNi phase formed under RS conditions had Fe/Ni= 2 with solubility for the TM alloying additions. The microstructure of the extruded first alloy exhibited bands of finer and coarser structure without any remaining undeformed powder particles. The banding effect was far less pronounced m the extrusions of the second alloy, where the distribution of the Al 9 FeNi phase was more homogeneous but there was some evidence of non-fully deformed powder particles (< 5 vol%), which were always small (< 10 mum diameter) and hard particles exhibiting the Zone A microstructure of the RS powders. In addition to mu-Al and Al 9 FeNi, there was a very small volume fraction of Many undeformed particles, which were associated with extended porosity, were also present in the extrusion of the third alloy but bands of finer and coarser structure were not visible. The hot pressed powders of the fourth alloy were at best partially deformed and had retained their RS microstructure with some present in the as pressed microstructure. The microstructures of the consolidated alloys were stable after heat treatment at 673 K consisting of mu-Al, Al 9 FeNi and Ll 2 -Al 3 Zr and with the Al 9 FeNi phase experiencing some coarsening after 1000 h, especially in the first alloy, where also the banded structure disappeared after prolonged treatment. The Zone A microstructure was significantly harder than Zone B. The additions of Zr, Mo and V resulted to increases in hardness of 20 %, 60 % and 110 % over the first alloy in the as <b>extruded</b> or hot <b>pressed</b> conditions. After 1000 h at 673 K the hardness of the first alloy had dropped by 28 % and 24 % for the 18 : 1 and 25 : 1 extruded materials respectively, with the corresponding values for the second alloy being 17 % and 11 %. The hardnesses of the third and fourth alloys had dropped by about 15 %. Higher tensile properties were achieved in the alloys extruded with ER= 18 : 1. The ductilities of all alloys were poor owing to the high volume fractions of Al 9 FeNi. The mu-Al matrix of the first alloy extruded at ER= 18 : 1 and 25 : 1 had a fibre texture with crystallographic directions parallel to the axis of the bar. The texture became stronger after heat treatment and consisted of a major fibre. Other minor components such as were also detected. Then- intensity was however fairly small when compared to. On the contrary, although the processing parameters were similar, the texture in the as-extruded bar of the second alloy (ER= 18 : 1 and 25 : 1) was almost random...|$|R
