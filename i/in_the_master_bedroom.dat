5|$|The present château, {{designed}} on {{a triangular}} plan, has five conical towers and a watchtower capped by slate roofs. Archaeologists have uncovered {{traces of the}} older buildings on the site {{dating back to the}} 11th century. The architect Frantz Jourdain renovated the interior of the 14th century tower as a library for the Rochefoucault family in 1893. The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries of the building, which hung <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom,</b> were rediscovered in 1850; they were later sold to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1923.|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{became the}} First Lady of the United States when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as {{president}} in January 1981. Early in her husband's presidency, Reagan stated {{her desire to}} create a more suitable [...] "first home" [...] in the White House, as the building had fallen into a state of disrepair following years of neglect. White House aide Michael Deaver described the second and third floor family residence as having [...] "cracked plaster walls, chipped paint [...] beaten up floors"; rather than use government funds to renovate and redecorate, she sought private donations. In 1981, Reagan directed a major renovation of several White House rooms, including all of the second and third floors and rooms adjacent to the Oval Office, including the press briefing room. The renovation included repainting walls, refinishing floors, repairing fireplaces, and replacing antique pipes, windows, and wires. The closet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> was converted into a beauty parlor and dressing room, and the West bedroom was made into a small gymnasium.|$|E
500|$|The Old Stone House (3051 M Street NW) {{was built}} in 1765 by Christopher and Rachel Layman. The house was sold in 1767 to a wealthy widow, Cassandra Chew, who {{constructed}} a kitchen in the rear in 1767, and a second floor between 1767 and 1775, and a third floor in the 1790s. It remained in private hands for almost two centuries, used as a home and place of business, until the federal government purchased it in 1953 [...] An exceptionally large number of spirits, residents and visitors claim, inhabit the small house. These include: A woman in a brown dress standing near the fireplace, a heavy-set woman standing on the staircase {{and also in the}} kitchen, a man with long blond hair and wearing a blue jacket, a man wearing short pants and long stockings, a woman in a rocking chair on the third floor, a small boy who runs down the third floor hallway, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing standing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom,</b> a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing seen on the second floor, a young girl with curly hair {{running up and down the}} staircase, an African American boy, and a German-looking craftsman. The laughter of invisible children and the translucent images of women cooking in the kitchen have also been observed. The Old Stone House may also contain one of Washington's only malevolent spirits, nicknamed [...] "George," [...] who has choked and pushed visitors and whose presence (often indicated by an extremely cold spot) leaves witnesses with an intense feeling of dread. The hauntings at the Old Stone House are so well known that they were mentioned in Sandi Wilson's short crime story, [...] "The Blonde in Black." ...|$|E

2500|$|The new {{interiors}} were in {{a different}} style and at a larger scale.

The circa-1888 alterations probably included the front bedroom's buff-colored, terra-cotta fireplace and mantel, the detailing of which {{is closely related to}} the reading room of Furness's contemporaneous University of Pennsylvania Library (1888–91).|$|E

5|$|Seeing Arnaud felled by gunfire, Magruder, who {{was wearing}} body armor, stepped back and drew her sidearm. However, before she could return fire, Logan then shot six bullets at her, one of which struck her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head, mortally {{wounding}} her. Logan then went over to Arnaud and, while standing over his body, shot him four more times, injuring his liver and inducing severe internal bleeding.

40|$|After {{the recent}} great growth of <b>the</b> economy <b>in</b> Japan, <b>the</b> size of <b>the</b> house average <b>in</b> Japan is increasing. As a consequence, the size is next largest {{to that of}} the United States. But, <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> privacy {{standards}} have not yet been established. In this investigation, we studied this situation and considered the house plan. And we considered the design of the house, the family structure and the size of <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom.</b> We did a questionnaire in 1991, and we analyzed <b>the</b> differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> function and role played by the form of <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom.</b> As a result of our inquiry and analysis, we considered the following as the reasons why <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> was not established. The first is {{that it is difficult to}} get a closed space for privacy because the plan of traditional Japanese house follows the open plan. The second is that the children 2 ̆ 7 s, room is given precedence over <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> for using <b>the</b> closed space. The third reason is that there are few couples who want to establish <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> as a private room. And we realized that if <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> is a Japanese-style room or next to the kitchen or dining room or placed on the first floor, the other room 2 ̆ 7 s function invades their rooms. ...|$|R
