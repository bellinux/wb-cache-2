40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{evaluate}} {{the risk of}} birth defects relative to exposure to specific trihalomethanes in public water supplies.  METHODS—A retrospective cohort study was conducted {{based on data from}} a population based perinatal database in Nova Scotia, Canada and from the results of routine water monitoring tests. The cohort consisted of women who had a singleton birth in Nova Scotia between 1988  and 1995  and who lived in an area with a municipal water supply. The birth defects analyzed included neural tube defects, cardiovascular defects, cleft defects, and chromosomal abnormalities. Two of the four trihalomethane compounds occur in large enough concentrations to be analyzed (chloroform and bromodichloromethane (BDCM)).  RESULTS—Exposure to BDCM at concentrations of 20  µg/l or over was associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects (adjusted relative risk (RR) 2. 5,  95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 2  to 5. 1) whereas <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>chloroform</b> was not. Exposure to BDCM of 20  µg/l and over was associated with decreased risks of cardiovascular anomalies (RR 0. 3,  95 % CI 0. 2  to 0. 7). There was a suggestion of an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities associated with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>chloroform,</b> and no evidence of any association between either trihalomethane compound and cleft defects.  CONCLUSIONS—In this cohort, differences were found in the RR associated with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>chloroform</b> and BDCM for each of the congenital anomalies under study. These findings point to the importance of examining specific byproduct compounds relative to risk for these birth outcomes and in particular implicate BDCM and other correlated disinfection byproducts in the aetiology of neural tube defects.    Keywords: trihalomethanes; birth defect...|$|E

Here, we investigated 19 new M. pusilla-specific viruses (MpVs) isolated from different locations and years. We performed partial characterization of those MpVs including structural characteristics, genome size, phylogenetic analysis based on partial DNA polymerase gene sequences, host range, and stability at different temperatures and upon <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>chloroform.</b> Combined, these characteristics allowed classification of the MpVs into 2 groups. <b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>chloroform</b> led to loss of infectivity by all MpVs in one group, which suggests the presence of an outer lipid envelope.

The activity of plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) increases even more than the liver weight at corresponding concentrations, but only in the males. Depletion of testosterone through castration or destruction of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, are the only other ways to experimentally induce corresponding increases in BuChE. Plasma BuChE activity increase was found to be a common reaction after <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> TCE, perchloroethylene, <b>chloroform,</b> methylene chloride and carbon tetrachloride and also after <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> ethanol. Other solvents such as toluene, xylene, benzene and 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane had little or no effect on BuChE activity. Normal and castrated male mice were continuously exposed for one month to 150 p. p. m. TCE. The increase in BuChE activity after the exposure was of the same magnitude as the increase seen after castration. BuChE activity in castrated males was not further increased by TCE exposure. Administration of testosterone with osmotic minipumps for 13 days almost restored the normal testosterone and BuChE levels in castrates. The effect of TCE exposure on BuChE activity in these animals was the same as on normal males. Testosterone levels were not influenced by the TCE exposure in normal males or in castrates given testosterone. No sex hormone binding globulins (SHBG) could be detected in the mice. BuChE activity changes induced through solvent exposure are therefore neither directly nor indirectly (through SHBG) due to effects on testosterone.

Second: Does a high protein diet afford the same protection against <b>chloroform</b> poisoning <b>to</b> the liver of a hyperthyroid rat that it does to the normal liver? To test the hypothesis that a low glycogen con-tent of the liver is responsible for the increased susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>chloroform</b> poisoning in rats fol-lowing the administration of thyroxin, the problem was approached in two ways. In one set of ex-periments an attempt was made to maintain a nor-mal glycogen content of the liver in animals re-ceiving thyroxin, and their susceptibility to chloro-form poisoning was then tested.

Recently, we have demonstrated that ordered nanoporous thin film can be fabricated from a simple supramolecular assembly approach. Here we will extend this approach and provide a general route to fabricate large areas of highly ordered polymeric nanodot and nanowire arrays. We revealed that under a mixture solvent annealing atmosphere, a neardefect-free nanoporous thin film over large areas can be achieved. Under the direction of interpolymer hydrogen bonding and capillary action of nanopores, this ordered porous nanotemplate can be properly filled with phenolic resin precursor, followed by curation and pyrolysis at middle temperature to remove the nanotemplate, a perfect ordered polymer nanodot arrays replication was obtained. The orientation of the supramolecular assembly thin films can be readily re-aligned parallel to the substrate upon <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>chloroform</b> vapor, so this facile nanotemplate replica method can be further extend to generate large areas of polymeric nanowire arrays. Thus, we achieved a successful sub- 30 nm patterns nanotemplates transfe...|$|E

We conducted a nested case-control study of 682 pregnant women in Kaunas (Lithuania) and, using individual information on drinking water, ingestion, showering and bathing, and uptake factors of THMs in blood, estimated an internal THM dose. We used logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between internal THM dose, birth outcomes and individual and joint (modifying) effects of metabolic gene polymorphisms. THM exposure during entire pregnancy and specific trimesters slightly increased low birth weight (LBW) risk. When considering both THM exposure and maternal genotypes, the largest associations were found for third trimester among total THM (TTHM) and chloroform-exposed women with the GSTM 1 – 0 genotype (OR: 4. 37; 95 % CI: 1. 36 – 14. 08 and OR: 5. 06; 95 % CI: 1. 50 – 17. 05, respectively). A test of interaction between internal THM dose and GSTM 1 – 0 genotype suggested a modifying effect of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>chloroform</b> and bromodichloromethane on LBW risk. However, the effect on small for gestational age (SGA) was not statistically significant. These data suggest that THM internal dose may affect foeta...|$|E
40|$|The present article {{reports on}} the {{characterisation}} of spin coated thin films of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) for their use in organic vapour sensing application. Thin film properties of PMMA are studied by UV-visible spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique. Results obtained show that homogeneous thin films with thickness in the range between 6 and 15 nm have been successfully prepared when films were spun at speeds between 1000 - 5000 rpm. Using SPR technique, the sensing properties of the spun films were studied on <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> several halohydrocarbons including chloroform, dichloromethane and trichloroethylene. Data from measured kinetic response {{have been used to}} evaluate the sensitivity of the studied films to the various analyte molecules in terms of normalised response (%) per unit concentration (ppm). The highest PMMA film sensitivity of 0. 067 normalised response per ppm was observed for chloroform vapour, for films spun at 1000 rpm. The high film's sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>chloroform</b> vapour was ascribed mainly to its solubility parameter and molar volume Values. Effect of film thickness on the vapour sensing properties is also discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
