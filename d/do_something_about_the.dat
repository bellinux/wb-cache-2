5|$|In the 1890s {{some people}} – {{including}} the young Calogero Vizzini – decided to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> absence {{of peace and}} security in the countryside. The state police {{at the time was}} as much a danger as the brigands. The Villalba Mafia thus emerged as an alternative social regime centred on the membership in church-sponsored associations that generated considerable social capital. It later transformed into a protection racket, victimizing villagers and landowners alike through violence, intimidation and omertà.|$|E
25|$|To {{conservative}} elements this protest {{seemed to}} flout {{the law and}} as a result the government found itself under increasing pressure to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation. Private groups of concerned citizens began to form also, many of them formed from returned servicemen, from organisations such as the Returned Soldiers and Citizens Political Federation and the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia (RSSILA). As the tension mounted, another demonstration was planned for March.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the fall}} of Tripoli, king Henry of Cyprus sent the senechal Jean de Grailly to Europe to warn European monarchs about the {{critical}} situation in the Levant. Jean met with Pope Nicholas IV who shared his worries and {{wrote a letter to}} European potentates to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Holy Land. Most however were too preoccupied by the Sicilian question to organize a Crusade, as was king Edward I too entangled in troubles at home.|$|E

2500|$|... 2,286 cc petrol/diesel, overhead-valve type 11J: five-bearing crank: In 1980, Land Rover finally <b>did</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> crank {{failures}} {{which had}} plagued its four-cylinder engines for 22 years. These engines lasted beyond {{the end of}} Series III production and into {{the first couple of}} years of the new Ninety and One Ten ranges.|$|R
5000|$|On 2 August 1931, Neumann and Kippenberger {{received}} a dressing down from Walter Ulbricht, the KPD's {{leader in the}} Berlin-Brandenburg region. Enraged by police interference, Ulbricht snarled, [...] "At home in Saxony we would have <b>done</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> police a long time ago. Here in Berlin we will not fool around much longer. Soon we will hit the police in the head." ...|$|R
500|$|Despite this, {{the growing}} numbers of {{settlers}} (very quickly outnumbering Yavapai) began to call {{for the government to}} <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> people occupying the land that they wanted to occupy and exploit themselves. The editor of a local newspaper, the Arizona Miner, said [...] "Extermination is our only hope, and the sooner it is accomplished the better." ...|$|E
500|$|In his concert {{review for}} The Village Voice, Don Heckman {{described}} [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] as [...] "a song which expresses {{far better than}} words {{what kind of man}} Harrison is". Heckman went on to compare Harrison's philanthropy with the activities of two of his former bandmates, saying: [...] "I have no quarrel with John Lennon's endless clattering around inside his psyche, or Paul McCartney's search for sweetness and light, but at the moment I have to have stronger feelings about George Harrison's active efforts to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> misery in the world around him. How surprising that the most introspective of the Beatles should be the one who, in the long run, takes the most effective actions." ...|$|E
500|$|Noel, {{wanting to}} make the album as dense and [...] "colossal" [...] feeling as possible, layered {{multiple}} guitar tracks on several of the songs. In many instances he dubbed ten channels with identical guitar parts, {{in an effort to}} create a sonic volume. Creation's owner Alan McGee visited the studio during the mixing stage; he said, [...] "I used {{to go down to the}} studio, and there was so much cocaine getting done at that point... Owen was out of control, and he was the one in charge of it. The music was just fucking loud." [...] Morris responded, [...] "Alan McGee was the head of the record company. Why didn’t he <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> “out of control” record producer”? Obviously, the one not in control was the head of the record company." [...] He further explained that he and the band had been dealing with personal difficulties the day and night before McGee visited the studio.|$|E

50|$|In late May 2005, Alabama Congressman Spencer Bachus sent {{a letter}} to Time Warner's board of {{directors}} requesting Real Time be canceled after remarks Maher made after noting the military had missed its recruiting goals by 42 percent. Bachus said he felt the comments were demeaning to the military and treasonous. Maher stated his highest regard and support for the troops and asked why the congressman criticized him instead of <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> recruitment problem.|$|R
500|$|Saunders {{went to work}} in {{the logging}} {{industry}} in Gippsland, after which he moved to Sydney, where he was employed by the Austral Bronze Company. Seen by many as a role model and spokesman for Aboriginal Australians, in 1969 Saunders took up a position in the Office of Aboriginal Affairs as one of its first liaison officers. Among his tasks was promulgating information on recently legislated Federal funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses and schooling, following up on recommendations made to government departments, and liaising with Aboriginal welfare groups. He later stated, [...] "I felt a sense of leadership of Aboriginal people and a desire to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Aboriginal situation". His community work was recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 1971 when he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Civil Division. He continued to serve with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra until retiring in 1980. In July 1985 he was appointed to the Council of the Australian War Memorial, and held this position until his retirement. He was also involved in the RSL, though he fell out with leaders Alf Garland and Bruce Ruxton over Garland's suggestion that Aborigines be blood-tested to determine their entitlement to government benefits. [...] "They can take all the blood they want from me," [...] Saunders declared in a 1986 interview, [...] "and they'll never find out what I am– least of all an Aborigine– bloody stupid!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1968 he {{ran against}} the 81-year-old {{incumbent}} Democratic Senator Ernest Gruening, a popular {{former governor of}} the Alaska Territory who {{was considered one of}} the fathers of Alaska's statehood, for his party's nomination to the U.S. Senate. Gravel's campaign was primarily based on his youth rather than issue differences. He hired Joseph Napolitan, the first self-described political consultant, in late 1966. They spent over {{a year and a half}} planning a short, nine-day primary election campaign that featured the slogans [...] "Alaska first" [...] and [...] "Let's <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> state we're in", the distribution of a collection of essays entitled Jobs and More Jobs, and the creation of a half-hour, well-produced, glamorized biographical film of Gravel, Man for Alaska. The film was shown twice a day on every television station in Alaska and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of Alaska Native villages. The heavy showings quickly reversed a 2–to–1 Gruening lead in polls into a Gravel lead. Gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries. Gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his Vietnam policy. Gruening had been one of only two Senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and his opposition to President Lyndon B. Johnson's war policies was harming him among the Democratic electorate; according to Gravel, [...] "...all I had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject, and people would assume that I was to the right of Ernest Gruening, when in point of fact I was to the left of him." ...|$|E

5000|$|On December 3, 1895, the {{settlers}} Elizabeth Merrill and her father, Horatio Merrill, were murdered by hostiles near Solomonville and on March 28, 1896, Alfred Hands was killed at his cabin {{on the eastern}} side of the Chiricahua Mountains, near the present day town of Portal. Accounts differ, some say that the Apache Kid killed the Merrill's and Hands but Britt Wilson says it was Massai. Either way, the newspapers and Arizona citizens pressured the local authorities into <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> renegades.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the murders, in 1981, the SBI (State Bureau of Investigation) {{was given}} {{anonymous}} information that Fritz Klenner was [...] "a dangerous psychopath who was practicing medicine without a license." [...] However, no investigation ensued after {{the discovery of}} this information. In retrospect, {{the attorney general of}} the SBI, Rufus Edminsten, said that this vital piece of information was never brought to his attention. Edminsten later admitted that he wished he had <b>done</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation prior to its escalation.|$|R
5000|$|The media {{attention}} {{has put the}} government of Uganda under pressure to be seen <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> issue of child sacrifice and {{has resulted in the}} formation of an official government taskforce to deal with this matter in Ugandan society. The taskforce consists of an officer with a motorcycle and works without a proper budget. [...] Consequently, many Ugandans believe that the gesture of the Ugandan government is more a matter of window dressing to avert local and international criticism than a genuine attempt.|$|R
2500|$|Outraged at Reagan's visit, McKeithen {{urged the}} actor [...] "to return to Hollywood and <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{standing}} immorality and communism that flourishes in that city."

2500|$|Neal Radford said: [...] "I {{was getting}} {{increasingly}} frustrated as a dissatisfied voter {{and as such}} and wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation – so I joined UKIP.

2500|$|In 1984, Geldof {{responded to}} a BBC news report from Michael Buerk about the famine in Ethiopia by mobilising the pop world to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> images he had seen. [...] With Midge Ure of Ultravox he wrote [...] "Do They Know It's Christmas?" [...] {{in order to raise}} funds. The song was {{recorded}} by various artists under the name of Band Aid.|$|E
5000|$|Prominent anti-corruption {{cases in}} China are often an {{outgrowth}} of factional struggles for power in the CPC, as opponents use the [...] "war of corruption" [...] as a weapon against rivals in the Party or corporate world. Often, too, the central leadership's goal in cracking down on corruption is {{to send a message}} to those who step over some [...] "unknown acceptable level of graft" [...] or too obviously flaunt its benefits. Another reason is to show an angry public that <b>the</b> Party is <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> problem.|$|R

2500|$|On November 18, Nkunda ordered rebel {{troops to}} pull back [...] {{from the town of}} Kabasha, citing the need to avoid clashes, get {{humanitarian}} aid to the region and create [...] "separation zones" [...] between the government and rebel forces, which would be patrolled by UN peacekeepers; this was amongst the sacking of General Dieudonne Kayembe, armed forces chief of the Congolese army, after a chain of defeats. His replacement was cited as a bid to bolster military strength. According to MONUC commanders the town had been captured on Sunday, though they could not confirm whether withdrawal had begun. Meanwhile, the French Foreign Ministry circulated a draft asking the UN to reinforce the MONUC garrison in the Congo by 3,000. This move was stated as a possible measure of stability, but not one of peace. UN spokesman Alan Doss said that [...] "Reinforcements are not going to resolve all the problems... Reinforcements will allow us to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation, which has deteriorated fast, help us to stabilize the situation a bit, and allow the political and diplomatic process to go forward." [...] While the United Nations Security Council voted on Wednesday, Doss acknowledged that it could take months to get reinforcements in, but wanted to speed the process. Doss also stated that he believed the humanitarian effort was improving.|$|E
2500|$|He {{is listed}} as Vice President at Algae Systems, a Nevada-based company with a working demo-scale pilot plant in Daphne, Alabama, {{dedicated}} to commercializing novel methods at the water-energy nexus for growing microalgae offshore as a second-generation biofuels feedstock and converting it to useful crude via hydrothermal liquefaction, while simultaneously treating wastewater, reducing carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere, and producing biochar. At Startup Grind Jackson Hole on March 13, 2015, Barlow {{said that he was}} motivated to team up with Algae Systems after undergoing back surgery to address pain from an old ranching injury, while he had been an advisor to Herb Allison (president of Merrill Lynch at the time) and working to completely [...] "electronify" [...] financial transactions and speculative asset assembly (Barlow was named [...] "One of the 25 Most Influential People in Financial Services" [...] in the June 1999 issue of FutureBanker Magazine). The surgery successfully alleviated the pain and catalyzed Barlow to change his focus from building wealth to building infrastructure in order to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> “amount of alterations we are already enacting on Planet Earth... We are not necessarily making it warmer, but weirder.” At Startup Grind Jackson Hole, Barlow also explained how once over tea with “Grandmother of the Conservation Movement” Mardy Murie, he was inspired by her words, “Environmentalists can be a pain in the ass... But they make great ancestors.” Adopting this philosophy, Barlow says, “I want to be a good ancestor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About a {{month ago}} two suspicious-looking bounders went to live there. Watson says their faces were enough to hang them. Anyhow, {{they must have been}} pretty bad, for they made even the Eckleton police, who are pretty average-sized rotters, suspicious, and they kept an eye on them. Well, after a bit there began to be a regular {{epidemic}} of burglary round about here. Watson says half the houses round were broken into. The police thought it was getting a bit too thick, but they didn't like to raid the house without some jolly good evidence that these two men were the burglars, so they lay low and waited till they should give them a decent excuse for jumping on them. They had had a detective chap down from London, by the way, to see if he couldn't <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> burglaries, and he kept his eye on them, too." ...|$|E
