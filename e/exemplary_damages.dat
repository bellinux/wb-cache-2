Zuffa claimed that the [...] "use of the ULTIMATE FIGHTING name and mark is identical or confusingly similar to the use of the UFC marks, including the ULTIMATE FIGHTING name".

The introduction of the civil liability legislation has made more important the pleading of intention, in addition to negligence, so as to maximise damages awards.

Such an approach is attractive for plaintiffs because, in several jurisdictions, tort claims which plead intention have been excluded from the operation of the legislative restrictions on the quantum of damages awards, and prohibitions on <b>exemplary</b> and aggravated <b>damages.</b> This approach reflects the policy that those who intend the harmful consequences of their actions should be held fully responsible...|$|R

And he will presently see a confirmation of these statements in the bad name which the Sá Leonite bears upon {{the whole of the}} western coast. Yet, I repeat, the colony is changed for the better, physically by a supply of pure water, morally by the courage which curbed the black abuse. Twenty years ago to call a negro 'nigger' was actionable; many a 5l. has been paid for the indulgence of lèse-majesté against the 'man and brother;' and not a few 50l. when the case was brought into the civil courts. After a rough word the Sá Leonite would shake his fist at you and trot off exclaiming, 'Lawyer Rainy (or Montague) lib for town!' A case of mild assault, which in England would be settled by a police-magistrate and a fine of five shillings, became at Freetown a serious 'bob.' Niger, accompanied by his friends or his 'company,' betook himself to some limb of the law, possibly a pettifogger, certainly a pauper who braved a deadly climate for uncertain lucre. His interest was to promote litigation and to fill his pockets by what is called sharp practice. After receiving the preliminary fee of 5l., to be paid out of the plunder, he demanded <b>exemplary</b> <b>damages,</b> and the defendant was lightened of all he could afford to pay. When the offender was likely to leave the station, the modus operandi was as follows. The writ of summons was issued. The lawyer strongly recommended an apology and a promise to defray costs, with the warning that judgment would go by default against the absentee. If the defendant prudently 'stumped up,' the affair ended; if not, a capias was taken out, and the law ran its course. A jury was chosen, and I have already told the results.|$|E

Given the legislative changes to the law of negligence following the review of the law of negligence, 2 and particularly the damages restrictions which have been imposed, there has been renewed interest in the ancient trespass actions. Although difficult issues may arise in intentional tort claims such as proof of intention, 3 the extent to which insurance is available, 4 and whether vicarious liability will be imposed, 5 there may be advantages for plaintiffs who plead intentional torts, particularly trespass to the person.

40|$|Can juries handle complex cases? One way {{to frame}} this {{question}} in behavioral science terms is to ask: What tasks can juries perform well and what tasks will they perform poorly? Our basic precept is that the legal system should ask juries to perform tasks that they are good at performing and should not require juries to carry out tasks that they cannot perform well. A second guiding theme in our approach {{to the issue of}} jury competency is that the most relevant, most useful analyses of jury performance are based on empirical observations and data, not on rational analyses of hypothetical ideal situations [...] . Our assumption is that it is reasonable to conceive of some jury decisions as serving the function of controlling risky behavior. Thus, for example, when a jury is asked to consider <b>exemplary</b> or punitive <b>damages</b> to punish and deter members of society from engaging in conduct that is in reckless disregard of the risks to others, we view the judgment as involving social risk management. Thus we ask: Can the jury perform in a manner so that it serves as an effective societal risk manager? To avoid any pretense of suspense, we believe that this is an extremely difficult function that is often not performed effectively even by the best informed experts. The jury is ill-informed and poorly equipped to perform this function. In our view, effective risk identification and management often requires the application of technical, statistical, and scientific analytic tools that cannot be effectively communicated to the unschooled layperson through expert testimony in adversarial procedures...|$|R
40|$|The rules {{governing}} {{the measure of}} monetary remedies in contract, tort and equity differ largely between the three areas.   This thesis discusses the differences in relation to four issues. The first issue is remoteness of damage.   Liability in negligence and many other torts is limited to loss that could, {{at the time of}} the tortious act, be foreseen as possible.   Contract goes further and limits liability to loss that could, {{at the time of the}} contract, be contemplated as not unlikely.   Equitable liability is not limited by remoteness considerations. The second issue is non-pecuniary loss.   While tort shows a generous attitude towards the compensation of such loss, contract compensates non-physical distress and loss of reputation only where the prevention of such loss was “the object” of the contract broken.   Authority for equity is sparse. The third issue is contributory negligence.   Unreasonable conduct on the claimant’s part that contributes to the occurrence of the wrong or the ensuing loss leads to a proportionate reduction in liability by virtue of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 in tort and in contractual actions for the breach of a duty of care co-extensive in contract and tort.   Contributory negligence has no effect in other instances of contractual liability or in equity. The final issue is <b>exemplary</b> or punitive <b>damages.</b>   They are presently confined to three categories of tortious behaviour: abuse of power by public servants, profit-seeking behaviour and statutory authorisation. The differences between contract, tort and equity generate problems where a claim can be based on more than one cause of action.   This thesis challenges the present differences in relation to the four issues mentioned and suggests a uniform regime in each case.

40|$|This book {{challenges}} certain {{differences between}} contract, tort and equity {{in relation to}} the measure (in a broad sense) of damages. Damages are defined as the monetary award made by a court in consequence of a breach of contract, a tort or an equitable wrong. In all these causes of action, damages usually aim to put the claimant into the position the claimant would be in without the wrong. Even though the main objective of damages is thus the same for each cause of action, their measure is not. While some aspects of the measure of damages are more or less harmonised between contract, tort and equity (for example causation in fact and mitigation), significant differences exist in relation to: (1) remoteness of damage, which is the question of whether, when and to what degree damage needs to be foreseeable to be recoverable; (2) the compensability of non-pecuniary loss such as pain and suffering, distress and loss of reputation; (3) the effect of contributory negligence, which is the victim's contribution to the occurrence of the wrong or the ensuing loss through unreasonable conduct prior to the wrong; (4) the circumstances under which victims of wrongs can claim the gain the wrongdoer has made from the wrong; and (5) the availability and scope of <b>exemplary</b> (or punitive) <b>damages.</b> For each of the five topics, this book examines the present position in contract, tort and equity and establishes the differences between the three areas. It goes on to scrutinise the arguments in defence of existing differences. The conclusion on each topic is that the present differences between contract, tort and equity cannot be justified on merits and should be removed through a harmonisation of the relevant principles...|$|R
