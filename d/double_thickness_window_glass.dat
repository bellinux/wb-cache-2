40|$|A {{trapezoidal}} cavity absorber for {{a linear}} Fresnel reflector concentrator is analyzed and optimized via CFD simulation. The heat loss coefficient is introduced; {{the influences of}} ambient temperature, absorber temperature, cavity depth, inclination of side walls, insulation <b>thickness,</b> <b>glass</b> <b>window,</b> and emissivity of selective absorption coating have been studied. The results show that radiation dominates the cavity heat loss, and heat loss through the <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> is higher than through the insulation layer; among these factors, impact of emissivity of selective absorption coating and insulation layer is {{greater than that of}} the other factors. The simulation results via CFD prove that cavity with a 100 mm depth shows the best thermal performance among the parameters that have been taken into account...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{existence of}} short-range forces between unpolarized and polarized spin- 1 / 2 particles has {{attracted the attention}} of physicists for decades. These forces are predicted in various theories and provide a possible new source for parity (P) and time reversal (T) symmetry violation. We use an ensemble of polarized 3 He gas in a cell with a 250 um <b>thickness</b> <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> to search for a force from scalar boson exchange over a sub-millimeter ranges. This interaction would produce a NMR frequency shift as an unpolarized mass is moved near and far from the polarized ensemble. We report a new upper bound on the product g_{s}g_{p}^{n} of the scalar couplings to the fermions in the unpolarized mass, and the pseudoscalar coupling of the polarized neutron in the 3 He nucleus for force ranges from 1 e- 4 to 1 e- 2 m, which corresponds to a mass range of 2 e- 3 to 2 e- 5 eV for the scalar boson.

500|$|During the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, competitors of the American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> trust used a different approach to gain a technological advantage. The machines used by American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> replaced glass blowers, but still used the same blowing and cutting process used in the 1880s—although the company was constantly working to make the process more efficient. Competitors such as American inventor Irving W. Colburn began working on a machine that produced <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> using a different process. Colburn patented his work during {{the first decade of the}} 20th century. Although he filed for bankruptcy in 1912, his patents were purchased by Edward Drummond Libbey and Michael J. Owens—who hired Colburn to continue work on the machine. [...] Owens was the creator of the Owens Bottling Machine that revolutionized the glass bottle industry. [...] Working with Colburn, Owens improved the <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> machine enough that it began being used for production in 1921. By 1926, Libbey-Owens had gained a <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> market share of 29 percent, while American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass's</b> share was 59 percent. During the 1920s, Pittsburgh Plate Glass also developed a new process for making <b>window</b> <b>glass,</b> creating even more competition in the <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> industry.|$|R

500|$|During {{the spring}} of 1900, rumors {{circulated}} that American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> planned to move production from smaller plants in nearby Dunkirk and Redkey (factories 17, 30, 34, and 41) to the large southside Hartford City plant. If the Hartford City plant would have its capacity expanded equal to {{the capacity of the}} plants to be consolidated, then Hartford City would have [...] "become the greatest <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> town in the world." [...] The plant would have employed nearly 1000 people, equaling the largest <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> plant in the world in capacity. That plant in combination with Hartford City's two other <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> factories, not even considering the flint glass plants or bottle plants, would make the city's <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> capacity the highest in the world.

500|$|The trust was {{incorporated}} effective August 2, 1899. James A. Chambers continued as president, and Hartford City’s H.B. Smith {{was one of}} the directors of the newly incorporated company. [...] Initial acquisitions included over 20 major <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> plants, including Hartford City Glass Company. Most of the original acquisitions were from Indiana and Pennsylvania.

500|$|Because of the {{improved}} technology and processes utilized by competitors, {{many of the}} American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> patents, and much of its machinery, became obsolete. By the late 1920s, American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> was forced to begin re-equipping its plants with new machinery. The company underwent a financial reorganization in 1929. Dividends on its preferred stock were lowered. Although a few plants were re-equipped, the Hartford City plant was not. [...] Hartford City's natural gas supply was depleted, {{and the type of}} sand used to produce glass was in better supply near other American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> plants in Pennsylvania. Thus, American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> Company plant number 3, the former Hartford City Glass Company, was closed in 1929.|$|R
