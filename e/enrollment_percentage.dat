Further investigation reveals that the highest‐priced public and private IHEs generally attract the highest percentage of non‐resident students. This suggests that the more costly IHEs, especially private, may enjoy a special cache that allows them more latitude in setting non‐resident tuition. The non‐resident <b>enrollment</b> <b>percentage</b> is not appreciably different across a wide range of tuition levels for both IHE types, indicating that these IHEs might be able to maintain their non‐resident <b>enrollment</b> <b>percentage</b> levels with marginal tuition increases.

40|$|An {{exploratory}} study, using Texas {{public school}} district data, {{was conducted to}} determine the relationship between each of two demographic characteristics, student <b>enrollment</b> and the <b>percentage</b> of economically disadvantaged students, and the technology level of progress. In addition, {{the relationship between the}} two demographic characteristics, taken together, and the technology level of progress was investigated. The researcher found that across each of the six Educator Preparation and Development (EPD) focus areas, student <b>enrollment,</b> and the <b>percentage</b> of economically disadvantaged students were not related to the technology level of progress. The researcher also found that there was no meaningful multivariate relationship for linking student <b>enrollment</b> and the <b>percentage</b> of economically disadvantaged students, taken together, to the technology level of progress. A major finding that emerged from the analyses was the fact that the majority of school districts across the student <b>enrollment</b> and <b>percentage</b> of economically disadvantaged students categories were at the same level of technology progress, Developing Tech. Moreover, the percent of school districts not progressing beyond theDeveloping Tech level was differential for each of the six EPD focus areas. Two conclusions emerged from the empirical evidence. First, although the Target Tech level percentages were all small, two of the 20 types of Texas school districts consistently yielded the highest percents across the six EPD focus areas. These were school district type four (SE Under 500, PEDS 75 % or Greater) and school district type twelve (SE 1, 001 - 5, 000, PEDS 75 % or Greater). Second and more significant in terms of creating future interventions, programs, and incentives, empirical evidence in this study suggests that much work still remains to be done if all Texas school districts are to reach the ultimate objective where all school districts reach the Target Tech level on all six focus areas. The current study informs the digital divide literature as it relates to school district characteristics. The findings from this study suggest that long-range technology planning and funding initiatives in recent years have been successful, in beginning to address digital divide issues related to Educator Preparation and Development technology progress in public school districts...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} school districts in the state of Texas that would be considered efficient based on the modified quadriform model, and to identify alterable school characteristics most associated with those efficient schools. The researcher used data from the 2003 - 2004 Texas Academic Excellence Indicator System in this analysis. Texas school districts that had low expenditures with high student output were classified as efficient. There were two stages to the modified quadriform analysis. In stage one the relationship between input and output was evaluated by two separate linear regressions. The input regression modeled total per pupil expenditure for the district regressed against unalterable school characteristics such as total district <b>enrollment,</b> <b>percentage</b> of economically disadvantaged students, percentage of special education students, percentage of minority students, and local tax base value per pupil. In the output regression six different measures of student outcomes were regressed against the same unalterable characteristics. The measures of student achievement used were the percentage of all students passing the math and reading Texas Assessments of Knowledge and Skills, graduation completion rate, percentage of students taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test and the ACT Test, and the mean scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and/or ACT Test. Once the efficient school districts were identified using the positive and negative residuals from the regressions, a discriminant analysis was conducted to determine what alterable characteristics had the most significant relationship with the different student outcome measures. Just over 32 % of Texas School Districts would be considered efficient in this model, and the number of students per teacher has a significant relationship with the output measures of mean SAT and ACT scores, district completion rate, and Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills scores in both math and reading.

To examine acculturation characteristics and ethnic orientations, the Korean American Acculturation Scale and the Ethnic Orientation Scale were administered to 466 students and 197 of their parents in the New York City and Chicago areas. Students and parents were divided into four acculturation style groups by the median score on two factors in the EOS (Korean orientation and Other-group orientation) : (a) assimilation, (b) integration, (c) marginalization, and (d) separation. Students also completed the Domain-Specific Self-Concept Scale and the Learning Styles Inventory-III (LSI, Renzulli et al., 2002). To survey teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions about Korean American students as gifted, the revised Scales for Rating the Behavioral Characteristics of Superior Students (Renzulli et al., 2002) was used. Seventy-nine teachers participated in this study. In addition, GreatSchools. net was used to collect contextual school data (e. g., school program, student-teacher ratio, school SES, and Asian student <b>enrollment</b> <b>percentage).</b> Ultimately 407 out of 466 students from 30 schools were analyzed by using a Hierarchical Linear Model (ELM) with two levels. ^ Data were analyzed using a Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) to assess the significance of independent variables on dependent variables. For gender and generation effects on acculturation characteristics (behavior and cultural value), females were characterized by a slower behavior acculturation rate into the mainstream culture than males. The more recent generations were more behaviorally acculturated into the mainstream culture. However, the adaptation process in cultural values was slow and depended on the generational status of Korean Americans. Korean Americans have adapted to the mainstream society by incorporating and changing selected cultural values. For gender and acculturation style effects on self-concepts (Academic, Appearance, Popularity, and Sensitivity to negative expression), female students showed lower Appearance self-concept than male students. Among four acculturation styles, integration style students showed higher Academic and Appearance self-concept than any other acculturation style groups. In terms of learning style preferences, female students preferred Peer teaching to male students. There were differences among acculturation styles in Direct instruction and Projects.

The Data Envelopment Analysis estimation method calculated and assigned efficiency scores to each of the 931 school districts considered in the study. The efficiency scores were utilized in two phases. First, the school district efficiency scores were combined with school district student achievement to evaluate effectiveness with efficiency. A framework was constructed to graph the scores on an x-axis of student achievement scores and a y-axis of efficiency scores to further illustrate the data. The framework was evaluated with the full statewide sample and with school districts categorized into similar peer groups. Then, using variables selected from related scholarly literature, a regression analysis identified which factors impacted school district efficiency statewide. The non-discretionary variables included in the study were total student <b>enrollment,</b> the <b>percentage</b> of non-white students and the percentage of economically disadvantaged students. The discretionary variables selected included the teacher-to-student ratio, teachers’ average years of experience, the percentage of teachers with master’s degrees and the average teacher base salary.

There is some evidence that being within 75 miles of an NHL team reduced attendance, while the percentage of undergraduate students who were women had no effect...|$|R
2500|$|Since 1995, the United Nations Development Program {{has been}} keeping Gender-related Development Index (GDI), a ranking of {{aggregate}} statistics of development, with focus on gender inequality. Ivory Coast has consistently ranked in the lowest quarter of the GDI: dropping to 166 of 177 in 2007, from 145 in 2005. Out of the 156 countries with both HDI and GDI values, 150 countries have a better ratio than Ivory Coast's. This movement {{is in line with}} Ivory Coast's Human Development Index trend, which peaked in 1985, and has dropped ever since. While leading neighbors like Mali, Niger, Ivory Coast consistently lags Senegal, Ghana, and The Gambia. In comparison to Senegal and France, female life expectancy at birth is around 60 percent of French totals, and 14.1 years less than Senegal, but this trend roughly mirrors male life expectancy at birth Adult literacy rates are higher than Senegal's, but current female <b>enrollment</b> as a <b>percentage</b> of males is now less, and estimated earned income for females in Ivory Coast is dramatically less, while Ivorian men may expect to earn more than their Senegalese neighbors. [...] A Senegalese men (per person/year) will be expected to USD $2,346, and Senegalese women USD $1,256, while an Ivorian man will average USD $2,472, but Ivorian women average just USD $795. [...] As of 2004, Ivory Coast's combined primary, secondary and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (female <b>enrollment</b> as a <b>percentage</b> male) trails Niger and Eritrea, even though its total percentage of children enrolled is much higher.|$|R
40|$|Mathematics {{education}} in the United States ranks poorly compared to other developed nations. This research paper examines calculus enrollment in over 18, 000 high schools across the United States to determine how school characteristics like race/ethnicity, school size, low income, urban/rural locale, state, and other variables associate with calculus offering and enrollment rates. Using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression, this study finds that race and ethnicity variables have the strongest correlation with calculus enrollment rates compared to other school characteristics. In particular, the percentage of Asian students at a school has the most statistically significant and meaningful positive correlation with calculus <b>enrollment,</b> while the <b>percentages</b> of black, Hispanic, and Native American students have negative correlations with calculus enrollment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the causal impacts of delayed primary school enrollment on children 2 ̆ 7 s {{educational outcomes in}} rural China. Instrumental variable estimates exploiting the discontinuity in children 2 ̆ 7 s enrollment age around the enrollment cut-off date indicate that a one-year delay in school enrollment increases the incidence of first-grade retention by approximately 10 percentage points for boys and reduces the probabilities of middle school <b>enrollment</b> by 6 <b>percentage</b> points for both boys and girls. These results suggest that delayed enrollment, even if {{it may be an}} optimal choice made by poor parents in response to financial constraints, is likely to be harmful to children 2 ̆ 7 s educational development in rural China...|$|R
