25|$|While other <b>keyboards</b> {{generally}} associate one {{action with}} each key, chorded <b>keyboards</b> associate actions with combinations of key presses. Since {{there are many}} combinations available, chorded <b>keyboards</b> can effectively produce more actions on a board with fewer keys. Court reporters' stenotype machines use chorded <b>keyboards</b> {{to enable them to}} enter text much faster by typing a syllable with each stroke instead of one letter at a time. The fastest typists (as of 2007) use a stenograph, a kind of chorded keyboard used by most court reporters and closed-caption reporters. Some chorded <b>keyboards</b> are also made for use in situations where fewer keys are preferable, such as on devices that can be used with only one hand, and on small mobile devices that don't have room for larger <b>keyboards.</b> Chorded <b>keyboards</b> are less desirable in many cases because it usually takes practice and memorization of the combinations to become proficient.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} my {{study was to}} {{investigate}} the experiences of forty-three fifth grade students with <b>keyboarding</b> instruction and to examine handwriting speed in relation to <b>keyboarding</b> speed. The intervention consisted of <b>keyboarding</b> instruction via the Type to Learn software program. Data collection included pre and post measurements of handwriting and <b>keyboarding</b> speed, observations, perception surveys, and student interviews. Results from the study indicated that students, even after <b>keyboarding</b> instruction, possess faster handwriting speeds than <b>keyboarding</b> speeds. Results indicated limited improvement in <b>keyboarding</b> speed after <b>keyboarding</b> instruction, but indicated positive student experience with <b>keyboarding</b> instruction and high levels of motivation toward continuing instruction. Negligible differences were noted between students who used <b>keyboard</b> masks and those who did not. Findings suggest a longer instruction period is necessary to produce <b>keyboarding</b> speeds that match handwriting speeds and that <b>keyboarding</b> instruction can be a positive experience for elementary students when planned in a developmentally appropriate manner...|$|R
