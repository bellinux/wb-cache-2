5|$|The {{mechanism}} that confines the narrow rings {{is not well}} understood. Initially {{it was assumed that}} every narrow ring <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of nearby shepherd moons corralling them into shape. However, in 1986 Voyager 2 discovered only one such shepherd pair (Cordelia and Ophelia) around the brightest ring (ε).|$|E
5|$|The {{window in}} the centre north wall has two lights (sections of window {{separated}} by a mullion); there are two pairs of two-light windows in the south wall. The window at the east end <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of lights, topped by trefoils (a stonework pattern of three overlapping circles).|$|E
5|$|Built with a {{range of}} shops to both sides, the modernist design of the {{entrance}} vestibule {{takes the form of a}} double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are three-dimensional versions of the Underground roundel. The central panel of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. The ticket hall beyond is octagonal with a central roof light of the same shape. The ticket hall originally <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of wooden ticket booths (passimeters) from which tickets were issued and collected, but these were removed when modern ticketing systems made them redundant.|$|E

5|$|The prosoma {{is formed}} in the embryo by fusion of the acron, which carries the eyes, with {{segments}} two to seven, which all have paired appendages, while segment one is lost during the embryo's development. Segment two <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of chelicerae, small appendages that often form pincers, segment three <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of pedipalps that in most sub-groups perform sensory functions, while the remaining four cephalothorax segments have pairs of legs. In primitive forms the acron <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of compound eyes on the sides and four pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes") in the middle. The mouth is between segments two and three.|$|R

5|$|During Australia's 2009—2010 summer, Mayberry {{was based}} in Europe and North America for training. At the 2009 World Championships, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of sixth places {{finished}} in the Super G and downhill events. That year, at a Spanish hosted IPC World Cup, he crashed in the giant slalom event and did not score a time. He was officially named to the Australian 2010 Winter Paralympics team in November 2009. A ceremony was held in Canberra with Australian Paralympic Committee president Greg Hartung and Minister for Sport Kate Ellis making the announcement. Mayberry was selected to the largest Winter Paralympics team that Australia had ever sent to the Games.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with hints of tiny conical teeth. However, 189 new finds {{in the years}} {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible. It <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s. This pitched Odontogriphus {{into the middle of the}} debate about whether Wiwaxia was closer to the mollusc or the annelid lineage, resulting in a frank exchange of views.|$|E
5|$|Eudimorphodonts can {{be divided}} into two major categories-those with long, robust wings similar to Campylognathoides, and those with long, slender wings. Species in the former category, {{including}} Carniadactylus and Eudimorphodon itself, were highly aerial animals and fast, agile flyers. The former was almost certainly insectivorous due to its small size; Eudimorphodon has been found with fish remains in its stomach. Slender-winged species, such as Austriadactylus and Caviramus, were likely terrestrial/semiarboreal in habits, and potentially generalists. Caviramus likely had a strong bite force, indicating an adaptation towards hard foods. All eudimorphodonts possessed well-developed molariform teeth and could chew their food, as indicated by the tooth wear on Caviramus and Eudimorphodon teeth. Austriadactylus and Eudimorphodon <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of these molariform teeth developed into enlarged fangs.|$|E

5|$|Further playoff defeats followed. In 1968, as a 32-year-old Ryan was benched {{in favor}} of Bill Nelsen, the Browns {{finished}} with a 10–4 record but lost to the Colts in the playoffs. Another playoff loss ended the Browns' season in 1969, this time to the Minnesota Vikings. After the American Football League's merger with the NFL was finalized in early 1970, the Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Colts moved to the new American Football Conference along with the 10 teams of the former AFL. The Browns were slotted in the AFC Central in the 26-team league, alongside the Steelers, the Houston Oilers and the Cincinnati Bengals, a team Paul Brown founded in 1968 in the AFL. Cleveland's first big move under the new league structure was to trade star receiver Paul Warfield in January 1970 to the Miami Dolphins {{for the rights to}} draft Purdue University quarterback Mike Phipps as a replacement for Bill Nelsen, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of bad knees.|$|E
5|$|The skull <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of horns {{above and}} in front of the eyes. These horns were {{composed}} of extensions of the lacrimal bones, and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into the horns. The horns were probably covered in a keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye, being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species (although they were fragile). There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in tyrannosaurids.|$|E
5|$|MD 704 {{follows the}} {{abandoned}} {{right of way}} of the defunct WB Railway, an interurban railroad that included a northsouth line between Washington and Baltimore and a branch to Annapolis from Naval Academy Junction in Odenton. Construction on the electric railway began in 1902 and service began between the three cities in 1908. The WB went into receivership in 1931 and shut down in 1935. The Maryland State Roads Commission converted the abandoned railroad right of way into a two-lane highway from the District of Columbia line to US 50 (now MD 450) near Lanham between 1942 and 1944. The WB <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of timber bridges across its right of way. The Chapel Road bridge in Seat Pleasant, which carried what was then MD 389 and is now Addison Road across the railroad, was removed; the junction was regraded as an intersection with the new highway. In 1944, the War Production Board authorized the replacement of MD 202's bridge across the abandoned railroad {{as one of the}} few nonwar-effort highway projects federally funded during World War II. Construction on the new steel-and-concrete bridge began in late 1944 and was completed by 1946. Access between the grade-separated highways at the MD 202MD 704 junction was via a pair of two-way ramps.|$|E

25|$|Most living {{vertebrates}} have pineal glands.

Some extinct Devonian fishes have two parietal foramina in their skulls, suggesting an ancestral bilaterality of parietal eyes. The parietal eye and the pineal gland of living tetrapods are probably the descendants of the left and right parts of this organ, respectively.|$|E
