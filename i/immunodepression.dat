40|$|Parasites often {{manipulate}} host immunity {{for their}} own benefit, either by exacerbating or suppressing the immune response and this may directly affect the expression of parasite virulence. However, genetic variation in <b>immunodepression,</b> which is a prerequisite to its evolution, {{and the relationship between}} <b>immunodepression</b> and virulence, have rarely been studied. Here, we investigated the variation among sibships of the acanthocephalan parasite, Pomphorhynchus laevis, in infecting and in immunodepressing its amphipod host, Gammarus pulex. We also assessed the covariation between infectivity, parasite-induced immune depression and host mortality (parasite virulence). We found that infectivity, the intensity of <b>immunodepression</b> and virulence were variable among parasite sibships. Infectivity and the level of <b>immunodepression</b> were not correlated across parasite sibships. Whereas infectivity was unrelated to host mortality, we found that gammarids that were exposed to the parasite sibships that immunodepressed their hosts the most survived better. This positive covariation between host survival and <b>immunodepression</b> suggests that gammarids exposed to the less immunodepressive parasites could suffer from damage imposed by a higher activity of the phenoloxidase...|$|E

40|$|Infections occur {{commonly}} {{following stroke}} and adversely influence outcome. Dysphagia, greater stroke severity and increasing age {{are associated with}} post-stroke infection, but post-stroke <b>immunodepression</b> is now recognised as an independent factor associated with increased susceptibility. Counter-regulatory responses, triggered by the proinflammatory response to stroke, appear to effect systemic <b>immunodepression</b> via suppression of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Experimental and clinical studies have identified a range of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive changes, including reduced mononuclear phagocyte and natural killer cell function, induction of antiinflammatory cytokines, apoptotic lymphocyte loss and altered T lymphocyte activity. A range of mechanisms has been proposed, including hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. The post-stroke balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms may be aimed at restricting the extent of inflammation and contributing to the restoration of immune homeostasis. However, severe inflammation in the brain may trigger major systemic, counter-inflammatory responses that ultimately compromise immune mechanisms required to combat pathogens. Although key pathways have been identified, {{the extent to which}} the various elements of post-stroke <b>immunodepression</b> are clinically relevant remains to be discovered. The identification of markers of <b>immunodepression</b> in the early post-stroke phase may prove useful for identifying patients that may have increased susceptibility to infection. It also seems likely that post-stroke <b>immunodepression</b> will need to be taken into account where stroke treatments impact upon inflammatory and immune pathways. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Stroke {{affects the}} {{normally}} well-balanced interplay of the 2 supersystems: the nervous and the immune system. Recent research elucidated {{some of the}} involved signals and mechanisms and, importantly, was able to demonstrate that brain-immune interactions are highly relevant for functional outcome after stroke. <b>Immunodepression</b> after stroke increases the susceptibility to infection, the most relevant complication in stroke patients. However, <b>immunodepression</b> after stroke may also have beneficial effects, for example, by suppressing autoaggressive responses during lesion-induced exposure of central nervous system-specific antigens to the immune system. Thus, before immunomodulatory therapy {{can be applied to}} stroke patients, we need to understand better the interaction of brain and immune system after focal cerebral ischemia. Until then, anticipating an important consequence of stroke-induced <b>immunodepression,</b> bacterial infection, preventive antibiotic strategies have been proposed. In mouse experiments, preventive antibiotic treatment dramatically improves mortality and outcome. Results of clinical studies on this issue are contradictory at present, and larger trials are needed to settle the question whether (and which) stroke patients should be preventively treated. Nevertheless, clinical evidence is emerging demonstrating that stroke-induced <b>immunodepression</b> in humans not only exists, but has very similar features to those characterized in rodent experiments.

40|$|A {{temporal}} {{relationship has been}} demonstrated between persisting immune complexes and non-antigen-specific <b>immunodepression.</b> Mice were given intraperitoneal injections of Bordetella pertussis at weekly intervals.

Spleen cells from immunodepressed pertussis-treated mice were transferred to irradiated normal recipients and displayed a normal response to SRBC. By contrast, spleen cells transferred from normal donors to irradiated pertussis-treated recipients had an impaired response to SRBC. Thus, the <b>immunodepression</b> caused by pertussis treatment is a property of the environment and not the lymphocytes themselves.

Responsiveness was also lower among high-ranking (aggressive) males regardless of infection status.

As in previous experiments, only low rankers modulated testosterone secretion in relation to current immunocompetence and corticosterone concentration. The lack of any downregulation of aggression in response to parasite-induced <b>immunodepression</b> contrasted with previous results using antithymocyte serum and {{may be due to}} the more localized nature of <b>immunodepression</b> during H. polygyrus infection.

40|$|Objectives: The {{surgical}} trauma, technically {{related to}} mechanism of organ ische-mia/reperfusion and endotoxin translocation through the gut cause a complex immune re-sponse. Pre – results showed a monocyte hyporesponsiveness induced by LPS, IL- 10 and TGF-ß in vitro similar to appearance of <b>immunodepression</b> in ICU patients. If lymphozytes are involved (IFN-gamma synthesis) {{like in the}} case of TGF-ß, an <b>immunodepression</b> reversal by IFN-gamma and GM-CSF is possible, exceptable for IL- 12 /IL- 18 (missing IFN-gamma synthesis). The purpose of the following {{study was to examine the}} genesis of immunodepres-sion in vivo concerning patients after postoperative stress. Design: The study group included 22 patients after cardiac surgery in an observation period of 4 days. Patients were divided in two groups: “patients with suspicion of infection or con-firmed infection” (11) and “patients without infection” (11). Both soluble (IL- 10, TGF-ß, PCT) and cellular indicators (HLA-DR-CD 14, ex-vivo LPS-induced TNF-alpha secretion) were measured. We assessed, whether IFN-gamma, IL- 12 /IL- 18 or GM-CSF are able to re-verse the decreased TNF-alpha secretion. Additionally the immunodepressive capacity of pa-tient sera was tested on healthy cells. Results: As expected all patients featured a postoperative <b>immunodepression,</b> pointed out by significantly decreased monocytic HLA-DR-expression and ex-vivo TNF-alpha secretion. The plasma levels of IL- 10 were significantly elevated in comparison to the control group (17). Significantly reduced ex-vivo TNF-alpha secretion at first postoperative day was counter-manded by IL- 12 /IL- 18 and GM-CSF. The incubation of patient plasma with healthy PBMCs caused no attenuated secretion of TNF-alpha after stimulation by LPS. Conclusion: In consequence of perioperative stress, a short term <b>immunodepression</b> is ad-justed, combined by a possible reversal with IFN-gamma, IL- 12 /IL- 18 or GM-CSF, pointing out a normal T-lymphozyt function (IFN-gamma production after IL- 12 /IL- 18) and a missing activation of TGF-ß in vivo. By contrast, studies conducted in septic patients with im-munoparalysis showed mostly an absent monocyte reversal by IL- 12 /IL- 18, which indicates a pronounced dysfunction.

40|$|The entomopathogenic bacterium, Xenorhabdus nematophila, induces <b>immunodepression</b> in target {{insects and}} finally leads to lethal septicemia of the {{infected}} hosts.

Here, we show direct evidence that X. nematophila inhibits the activity of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2), the initial step in the eicosanoid-biosynthesis pathway. Inhibition of PLA 2 was dependent on both incubation time with X. nematophila and the bacterial concentration in in vitro PLA 2 preparations of Manduca sexta hemocytes. While living bacteria inhibited PLA 2 activity, heat-killed X. nematophila rather increased PLA 2 activity. X. nematophila secreted PLA 2 inhibitor(s), which were detected in the organic, but not aqueous, extract of the bacterial culture medium.
