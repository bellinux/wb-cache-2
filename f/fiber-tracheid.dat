40|$|Most {{dicotyledonous}} {{species with}} secondary growth possess a single cylindrical vascular cambium. However, anomalous types are not uncommon. The various classification systems for anomalous patterns of secondary thickening are compared {{and the distribution}} of successive cambria in about 20 families of 13 orders is summarized. The distribution of this feature within the Phytolaccaceae is detailed including new observations showing successive cambia in Stegnosperma. Serial sections of different developmental stages of plant axes permitted precise three-dimensional reconstruction of the vascular system. Macerations of increments adjacent to the plant of transverse sectioning allowed comparison of xylem-cell dimensions between successive increments, different parts of individual plants, and all three species. Comparisons between species reveal that S. cubense has secondary xylem with the largest diameter pores, longest vessel elements, longest fiber-tracheids, and largest diameter <b>fiber-tracheid</b> pits. S. watsonii has the greatest number of pores per square mm, smallest <b>fiber-tracheid</b> diameter, and the largest ratio of <b>fiber-tracheid</b> to vessel-element length. Pore diameter, <b>fiber-tracheid</b> length, and the ratio of fiber tracheid to vessel-element length were less in small stems than in large stems and less in large stems than in roots. Pores per square mm, <b>fiber-tracheid</b> diameter, and vessel-element length were more or less constant between small stems and roots. Most xylary cell dimensions remain constant between successive increments of wood at a given level. The anomalous cambia arise in the conjunctive tissue and function bidirectionally. They are first evident as dedifferentiated parenchyma and then as small fascicular areas. Tangential expansion of existing regions produces larger arcs and rings of vascular tissue. Radial and tangential interconnections between vascular bundles are common in Stegnosperma. Dye movement traced through the axis confirms the presence of a complex network. At the upper and lower limits of a given ring or arc of anomalous vascular tissue, a radial connection occurs with the adjacent inner increment. The resulting pattern is a series of concentric cylinders of cambial zones, which anastomose with inner layers at their top and bottom. The normal increment of secondary thickening is the innermost cylinder and each successive layer forms a shorter but wider sheath around the previous layers. The apical organization of Stegnosperma consists of four zones: tunica, central mother cells, peripheral, and pith-rib meristem. A cambium-like or transition zone was not observed. The primary shoot vasculature is described as open, lacking direct vascular connections between sympodia, and followed a 2 / 5 phyllotaxy. Patterns of differentiation in shoot apices are detailed. The organization of the root apex as determined from seedling studies is analyzed by the constituent histogens. The vasculature of seedlings was found to follow the common dicotyledonous pattern. The initiation of secondary growth in the hypocotyl and its acropetal development is also typical of other dicotyledons. Secondary growth ascends the shoot helically according to phyllotaxy. The vascular cambium descends in the root, first appearing opposite the phloem and then in the pericycle. These observations are discussed in light of their differences with earlier studies, compared with other Phytolaccaceae, and examined with regard to the physiological function of the anomaly. Systematic implications are summarized and a tentative phyllogeny of the Phytolaccaceae is given...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for wood of 42 collections of 23 species of Ephedra from North and South America; data on bark anatomy are offered {{for most of}} these. For five collections, root as well as stem wood is analyzed, and for two collections, anatomy of horizontal underground stems is {{compared to that of}} upright stems. Vessel diameter, vessel element length, <b>fiber-tracheid</b> length, and tracheid length increase with age. Vessels and tracheids bear helical thickenings in 10 North American species (first report); thickenings are absent in Mexican and South American species. Mean total area of perforations per mm 2 of transection is more reliable as an indicator of conductive demands than mean vessel diameter or vessel area per mm 2 of transection. Perforation area per mm 2 is greatest in lianoid shrubs and treelike shrubs, less in large shrubs, and least in small shrubs. Plant size is roughly proportional to ecology, and thus perforation area per mm 2 is indicative also of ecology. Growth rings are not marked in lianoid or tropical or subtropical species. Latewood has few or no vessels (and thus offers maximal conductive safety) in species from colder and drier habitats. The ecology of the species range from dry to extremely dry habitats. Rays are mostly wide multiseriate, but three tropical or subtropical species have uniseriate rays plus narrow multiseriate rays-possibly a primitive condition. The fiber-tracheids (parenchyma of other authors) are nucleated, and are considered a result oftracheid dimorphism phylogenetically. Tracheids are vaguely storied in a few species. Minute calcium oxalate crystals cover outer surfaces of wood ray cells, phloem ray cells, sieve cells, and phloem parenchyma abundantly in most species; the crystals are slightly less abundant on vessel, tracheid, and <b>fiber-tracheid</b> surfaces (first report of these crystals on these cell types). Crystals, tannins, and five types of sclerenchyma in bark are considered types of herbivore deterrents. Bark of some species is richer in these features; other species are poor in sclerenchyma or tannins or both. Independent evolution of vessels in Gnetales and angiosperms is briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the anatomical structure of the wood of specimens of Mollinedia glabra (Spreng.) Perkins growing in two contiguous formations of restinga vegetation at Praia Virgem, in the municipality of Rio das Ostras, RJ. Both the Open Palmae (OPS) and the Sandy Strip Closed Shrub (SSCS) formations are found in coastal regions that receive between 1, 100 and 1, 300 mm of rainfall per year. Sapwood samples were collected in both formations. Typical anatomical features for this species include: solitary vessels, radial multiples or clusters elements, that are circular to angular in outline, 5 - 15 barred scalarifor perforation plates, ood parenchya scanty, septate fiber-tracheids, and wide multiseriate rays with prismatic crystals. Statistical analyses indicated {{a significant increase in}} the frequency of vessel elements and an increase in <b>fiber-tracheid</b> diameters in OPS individuals. These characteristics are considered structural adaptations to increased water needs caused by a greater exposure to sunlight. Continuous pruning may be responsible for the tyloses observed in OPS plants. The greater lengths and higher frequencies of the rays in SSCS trees ay be due to the greater diaeters of their branches. ur results suggest that. glabra develops structural adaptations to the restinga micro-environmental variations during its development...|$|E

We {{describe}} the wood structure of Aegiceras corniculatum and its differences under various soil salinities. This species had diffuse-porous wood with poorly defined growth rings. Vessels which had single perforations occurred abundantly and in multiples and were storeyed. Intervascular pits between contiguous vessels were alternate bordered ones while half-bordered pit-pairs existed between both vessel-ray and vessel-parenchyma. Homogenous xylem rays were multiseriate and uniseriate. <b>Fiber-tracheids</b> with bordered pits often had thinner walls. Xylem parenchyma cells were scant and distributed diffusely and paratracheally. Differences in the structural and quantitative characters of vessels, xylem rays and <b>fiber-tracheids</b> under diverse soil salinities are described...|$|R
40|$|The {{secondary}} xylem of Elaeagnus, Hippophae. and Shepherdia is described and illustrated in detail. Shrubs and small trees of Elaeaguaceae have ring-porous or semi-ring-porous wood with simple perforation plates, vascular tracheids, <b>fiber-tracheids,</b> diffuse or rarely paratracheal axial parenchyma, and uni- or biseriate rays in Hippophae and Shepherdia, but wider rays in Elaeagnus. Walls of vessel elements, especially narrow ones, tracheids, or <b>fiber-tracheids</b> sometimes show helical thickenings; {{in a few}} instances these intergrade with small bud-like protrusions associated with pits. Scanning electron microscopy illustrates that small to vestigial vestures are present in all species studied, although nonvestured pits are also common. The analogous nature of vestures and helical thickenings is considered. Comparative wood anatomy suggests a rather isolated position of the family Elaeagnaceae; affinities with Rhamnaceae, Proteaceae, and Thymelaeaceae are discussed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{hitherto}} unappreciated correlation {{exists between}} nature of vessel grouping {{and nature of}} imperforate tracheary elements in wood of dicotyledons at large: families and genera with true tracheids (large fully bordered pits common on both radial and tangential walls) have solitary vessels. Presence of true tracheids as a subsidiary conductive system is hypothesized to render vessel grouping a superfluous adaptation. Vessel grouping does occur to various degrees in taxa with <b>fiber-tracheids</b> or libriform fibers; the degree of grouping is related to likelihood or seriousness of vessel failure by air embolisms because of either drought or frost. Grouping of vessels {{is regarded as a}} way of providing alternate conduits whereby water can be carried in the same pathways in case one or several vessels in a group are incapacitated by air embolisms. Presence of vascular tracheids, if sufficiently abundant, is held to be correlated with smaller degree of vessel grouping because vascular tracheids can form a subsidiary conductive system; small numbers of vascular tracheids do not affect vessel grouping patterns. Species which possess vasicentric tracheids possess a subsidiary conductive system ideally located around vessels and have solitary vessels or else (ifvasicentric tracheids are less common) a low degree of vessel grouping. Species with very large vessels at the beginning of growth rings tend to have little grouping in the earlywood vessels but more grouping in latewood vessels; this dimorphism is held to relate to enhanced safety oflatewood vessels, since earlywood vessels have little safety and the latewood is thereby the wood portion where safety mechanisms are concentrated. <b>Fiber-tracheids</b> do not have sufficient conductive capabilities to form a subsidiary conductive system; borders on pits of <b>fiber-tracheids</b> are rapidly lost during evolution, and such loss generally pr~cedes appearance of septate or nucleated conditions or is simultaneous with it. Relative selective value of the various vessel grouping types (clusters, radial multiples, diagonal bands, tangential bands) as well as of larger aggregations remains a topic for more investigation, as does significance of grouping of primary xylem vessels...|$|R
40|$|The seven {{families}} hypothesized by Sosa and Chase {{to comprise}} Crossosomatales possess relatively long vessel elements with scalariform perforation plates and scalariform to opposite vessel-ray pitting; tracheids; diffuse axial parenchyma; and heterogeneous rays. These and other primitive character {{states do not}} indicate relationships, {{but they do not}} offer any evidence against the idea that Crossosomatales are a natural order. Departures from the primitive character states are related to ecological adaptations. Crossosomataceae have simple perforation plates (scalariform brieﬂy {{at the beginning of the}} secondary xylem), a feature correlated with the seasonal aridity of habitats occupied by the family, the sole family of the order to exhibit such an ecological shift. Presence of tracheids (which confer embolism resistance to a wood) in ancestors of Crossosomataceae probably pre-adapted the family for entry into highly seasonal habitats. Minimal vessel grouping in all other genera shows that tracheid presence deters vessel grouping; tracheid presence also deters shortening of vessel elements. Autapomorphies are shown by Aphloiaceae (tracheid dimorphism, rays of two distinct widths); Crossosomataceae (perforation plates predominantly simple, lateral wall pitting of vessels alternate); Geissolomataceae (wide rays); Ixerbaceae (<b>ﬁber-tracheid</b> tendency); Staphyleaceae (adjacence of axial parenchyma to vessels); Stachyuraceae (simpliﬁcation of perforation plates); and Strasburgeriaceae (large cell size). Although tracheid presence seems plesiomorphic in Crossosomatales, a degree of lability in density and size of bordered pits on imperforate tracheary elements probably occurs within this order and in other dicotyledon groups...|$|E
40|$|Certain dicotyledon {{families}} characteristically have tracheids {{as their}} imperforate tracheary element type. Of these, six families are anomalous by having septate (or nonseptate but living) fiber-tracheids or libriform fibers coexisting with the tracheids in some species or genera (Austrobaileyaceae, Celastraceae, Convolvulaceae, Ericaceae, and Grossulariaceae, and Rosaceae). Data {{from the literature}} and original data on wood anatomy of these families are presented. A theory of tracheid dimorphism is developed to account for these instances of tracheids combined with fiber-tracheids or libriform fibers. According to this theory, septate or living fiber-tracheids or libriform fibers are produced in addition to tracheids, starting with ancestors that contain tracheids as the only imperforate tracheary element type, in response to selection for a rapidly increased photosynthate storage capacity, while maintaining the advantage of tracheids in providing conductive safety. Borders are phyletically lost rapidly on the septate (or nonseptate but living) imperforate tracheary elements {{because they are not}} water-conducting cells. Genera cited in this stud y can be ranged into a phyletic series with respect to differentiation from the hypothetical monomorphic-tracheid ancestors with respect to (I) loss of borders on pits of the septate or living elements; (2) distribution of tracheids with respect to vessels; and (3) retention of axial parenchyma. Austrobaileya is the most primitive genus in these respects, while genera such as Holodiscus and Spiraea are specialized. Tracheid dimorphism is compared to vessel dimorphism, <b>fiber-tracheid</b> dimorphism, fiber dimorphism, and the dimorphism related to origin of vessels. All these pathways except the last named one are confined to small numbers of families, and are considered minor trends superimposed on the major trends described by I. W. Bailey and coworkers. Basic to all of the dimorphic behaviors described is selection for two divergent cell types as a way of performing two distinctive wood functions...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} features are presented for 13 collections of 8 species of Ascarina. Wood anatomy is maximally primitive in most respects; moderate exception {{occurs in the}} imperforate tracheary elements, which range from tracheidlike (A. solmsiana) to <b>fiber-tracheids</b> (septate in two species). Perforation plates are scalariform, average more than 100 bars per plate, and have bordered bars. Even more significantly, portions of the primary walls in perforations characteristically fail to dissolve; these pit membrane portions range from nearly intact (much like the pit membranes in pits on end walls of tracheids of vesselless dicotyledons) to remnant strands or flakes. Dissolution of pit membranes in perforations is apparently inhibited by deposition of resinlike substances in some species; the rugose surfaces formed by these deposits may account for a report of vesturing on vessel walls of Ascarina. Axial parenchyma is diffuse, with only very small expressions of diversification; apotracheal banded parenchyma is, however, present in A. swamyana. Wood of Ascarina is highly mesomorphic. With age of plant, vessels increase in diameter, vessel elements and <b>fiber-tracheids</b> increase in length, and rays become wider and have {{a higher proportion of}} procumbent cells; uniseriate rays decrease in abundance. The implications of wood anatomy data on generic distinctions within the family and on the systematic position of Chloranthaceae will be examined when monographs on woods of the other genera have been completed...|$|R

Because both large and smaller wood samples of D. vitiensis were studied, ontogenetic changes in the wood are presented and separated from those features that probably vary with the species. Tyloses and perforated ray cells are newly reported for Degeneria. Anatomy of mature bark of D. roseiflora is described. Wood anatomy of Degeneria is moderately primitive. Although Degeneria is often compared to Himantandraceae and Magnoliaceae, Eupomatiaceae also seem very close, if not closer...|$|R
40|$|Summary Two {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} to explain how high positive pressures are developed in sugar maple stems when temperatures fluctuate around freezing. The Milburn– O’Malley theory proposes that pressure development is purely physical and does not require living cells or sucrose. The os-motic theory invokes the involvement of living cells and su-crose to generate an osmotic pressure difference between fibers and vessels, which {{are assumed to be}} separated by an osmotic barrier. We analyzed wood of Acer saccharum Marsh., Juglans cinerea L. and Betula papyrifera Marsh. (all generate positive pressures) examining three critical components of the osmotic model: pits in cell walls, selectivity of the osmotic barrier and stability of air bubbles under positive xylem pressure. We ex-amined the distribution and type of pits directly by light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and indirectly by perfu-sion of branch segments with fluorescent dyes with molecular masses similar to sucrose. The latter approach allowed us to use osmotic surrogates for sucrose that could be tracked by epifluorescence. Infusion experiments were used to assess the compartmentalization of sucrose and to determine the behavior of gas bubbles as predicted by Fick’s and Henry’s laws. The SEM images of sugar maple revealed a lack of pitting between fibers and vessels but connections between <b>fiber-tracheids</b> and vessels were present. Fluorescein-perfusion experiments dem-onstrated that large molecules do not diffuse into libriform fi-bers but are confined within the domain of vessels, parenchyma and <b>fiber-tracheids.</b> Results of the infusion experiments were in agreement with those of the fluorescein perfusions and fur-ther indicated the necessity of a compartmentalized osmolyte to drive stem pressure, as well as the inability of air bubbles to maintain such pressure because of instability. These results support the osmotic model and demonstrate that the secondary cell wall is an effective osmotic barrier for molecules larger than 300 g mol– 1...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} the single species of Plakothira, a {{recently}} discovered genus from the Marquesas Islands, is described qualitatively and quantitatively. Features new for the family include presence of vasicentric scanty axial parenchyma and presence of perforated ray cells. Plakothira has several wood features specialized for Loasaceae: vasicentric axial parenchyma, extremely reduced borders on fibertracheids, and storying in <b>fiber-tracheids.</b> Wood of Plakothira is clearly loasaceous. Storying in fibertracheids is reported here for the loasaceous genera Fuertesia and Mentzelia. Wood anatomy of Plakothira represents paedomorphosis in great length of vessel elements, erectness of ray cells, lack of change in large primary rays, and in presence of occasional scalariform perforation plates. Plakothira has wood features maximally mesomorphic for the family, correlating with its cloud-forest habitat and semisucculent wood and cortex structure...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{of three}} species of Viviania from Chile was studied. The wood has growth rings, {{moderately}} grouped vessels, helical sculpture in vessels, <b>fiber-tracheids</b> with small pits, and {{various degrees of}} storying. Axial parenchyma and rays are absent, regardless of age of stem. These facts are in accord with close relationship to other genera of Geraniaceae sl. Viviania differs from other Geraniaceae in presence of borders on imperforate tracheary elements and presence of endosperm; other differences (polyporate pollen; loculicidal capsules) are shared with some other genera which have familial status according to some authors, subfamilial status according to others. Viviania {{is probably the most}} distinctive element within Geraniaceae s. l., but other genera are close behind in this regard. Wood features of Viviania are in accord with the dry habitats occupied by this genus...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for 22 collections of 14 species of Hedyosmum. Wood {{of the genus}} is primitive in its notably long scalariform perforation plates; scalariform lateral wall pitting of vessel elements; and the low ratio of length between imperforate tracheary elements and vessel elements. Pit membrane remnants are characteristically present to various degrees in perforations of vessel elements; this is considered a primitive feature that is related to other primitive vessel features. Specialized features of Hedyosmum wood include septate <b>fiber-tracheids</b> with much reduced borders on pits; vasicentric axial parenchyma; and absence of uniseriate rays (in wood of larger stems). Ray structure (predominance of upright cells) and ontogenetic change in tracheary element length are paedomorphic, suggesting the possibility of secondary woodiness in the genus. Wood structure is highly mesomorphic...|$|R
40|$|Vasicentric tracheids {{are defined}} as tracheids present {{adjacent}} to vessels in a wood which also possesses libriform fibers or <b>fiber-tracheids</b> as imperforate tracheary elements. Vasculartracheids would correspond with this definition, but {{are defined as}} occurring only in latewood, whereas vasicentric tracheids occur throughout a growth ring or in wood of a diffuse-porous species. V asicentric tracheids offer a subsidiary conducting system which can supply stems and leaves when the vessels to which vasicentric tracheids are adjacent fail because of air embolisms. True tracheids (present as the sole imperforate tracheary element type in the woods in which they occur) have much the same physiological effect, maximizing potential safety in conduction. Vasicentric tracheids, vascular tracheids, and true tracheids are alike in being imperforate tracheary elements bearing relatively large bordered pits approximately like those on lateral walls of vessels in density. Libriform fibers or <b>fiber-tracheids</b> also occur in woods in which vasicentric tracheids or vascular tracheids are present. Vascular tracheids, by virtue of occurrence {{only at the end}} of a growth ring (where they grade into narrow vessel elements), maintain water columns in stems, which thereby persist through dry seasons, but may not adequately supply leaves, which may wilt as drought progresses. Vasicentric tracheids, by safeguarding the conduction of all parts of a growth ring, seem related to the evergreen habit which many shrubs possessing vasicentric tracheids have. Phylads with true tracheids are relatively few in dicotyledons, and only a small part ofthese groups have evidently succeeded in adapting to dry climates. The numerous phylads which instead have libriform fibers or <b>fiber-tracheids</b> have developed comparable safety by evolving vasicentric tracheids. Therefore genera with vasicentric tracheids bulk large in the floras of areas in which evergreen drought-tolerant shrubs are adaptive, the Mediterranean-type areas of the world. In southern California, 26 families (17 reported for the first time) have vasicentric tracheids; notable genera include Arctostaphylos, Ceanothus, Prunus, Quercus, and Salvia. Desert shrubs have vasicentric tracheids to a somewhat lesser degree. Other Mediterranean-type areas are surveyed for both vasicentric tracheids and true tracheids. The regions so analyzed are central Chile, southern Australia, the lands adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea, and southern Mrica. Genera in these areas with vasicentric tracheids include Banksia, Carissa, Eucalyptus, Grevillea, Hakea, Protea, Quercus, Rosmarinus, etc. New Zealand and Japan are wetter and have fewer genera with vasicentric tracheids but more with true tracheids. Many drought-tolerant evergreen shrubs have vasicentric tracheids. A new listing of families and genera with vasicentric tracheids is provided for the world flora, with new reports documented and pertinent literature cited. This new listing includes 68 families (33 newly reported in this paper), which represents a considerable advance on the 32 families listed by Metcalfe and Chalk in their compendia of 1950 and 1983, and includes some large and diverse families for the first time (e. g., Ericaceae, Pittosporaceae, Rosaceae). The lack of reports on occurrence of vasicentric tracheids may in part relate to difficulty in identifying these cells; suggestions for analysis are given...|$|R
40|$|Eight wood samples {{representing}} six {{species in}} two genera of Scytopetalaceae are examined {{with respect to}} qualitative and quantitative features. Rhaptopetalum differs from Scytopetalum by having scalariform perforation plates, <b>fiber-tracheids,</b> longer vessel elements, {{and a series of}} features probably related to the understory status of Rhaptopetalum is compared to the emergent nature of Scytopetalum. Features ofScytopetalaceae relevant to relationships of the family include (I) scaJariform perforation plates; (2) alternate medium-sized intervascular pits; (3) scalariform vessel-parenchyma pitting; (4) diffuse-in-aggregates and scanty vasicentric axial parenchyma; (5) axial parenchyma strands subdivided in places into chains of chambered crystals; and (6) rays that are high, wide, heterogeneous, and with erect cells comprising uniseriate rays. These features are compared for a number of families alleged by recent phylogenists to be related to Scytopetalaceae. Scytopetalaceae appears best placed in Theales, nearest to such families as Caryocaraceae, Lecythidaceae, Ochnaceae, Quiinaceae, and Theaceae, although Rosales (e. g., Cunoniaceae) must be cited also on account of numerous resemblances in wood anatomy...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{of seven}} {{collections}} of six species of Nolana, a genus (18 spp.) {{of the central}} western coast of South America was studied for quantitative and qualitative features. The wood is ring porous, with moderately wide vessels bearing simple perforation plates and alternate pits with some grooves interconnecting slitlike pit apertures. Imperforate tracheary elements are <b>fiber-tracheids</b> with vestigial borders on pits or libriform fibers; vasicentric tracheids (reported for Nolanaceae for the first time) are present in varying numbers. Axial parenchyma is vasicentric scanty (sometimes absent), sometimes with tangential bands that may be terminal in part. Rays are both multiseriate and uniseriate; ray cells are mostly erect. Crystal sand occurs in some ray cells and some axial parenchyma. The sum of features mark Nolanaceae as very close to Solanaceae. Wood of Nolana varies in xeromorphy; lower degrees of xeromorphy {{may be explained by}} succulence related to maritime habitat or to ephemeral nature of stems. The erect nature of ray cells and a decrease in vessel element length are indicators of paedomorphosis and thereby herbaceous ness of Nolanaceae...|$|R
40|$|The {{micromorphology}} of pits in {{tracheary elements}} was examined in 35 species representing 29 genera of Rosaceae and related families {{to evaluate the}} assumption that angiosperm pits are largely invariant. In most Rosaceae, pit membranes between fibers and tracheids frequently appear to have amorphous thickenings with an irregular distribution. Although these structures are toruslike under the light microscope, observations by electron microscopy illustrate that they represent ‘‘pseudotori’’ or plasmodesmata-associated thickenings. These thickenings frequently extend from {{the periphery of the}} pit membrane and form a cap-like, hollow structure. Pseudotori are occasionally found in few Elaeagnaceae and Rhamnaceae and appear to be related to species with <b>fiber-tracheids</b> and/or tracheids. True tori are strongly associated with round to oval pit apertures and are consistently present in narrow tracheary elements of Cercocarpus (Rosaceae), Planera (Ulmaceae), and ring-porous species of Ulmus and Zelkova (Ulmaceae). Vestured pits with homogenous pit membranes are reported for Hemiptelea (Ulmaceae). The homoplastic nature of pit membrane characteristics may be related to functional adaptations in terms of safety and efficiency of water transport or may reflect different developmental processes of xylem elements. These observations illustrate that there is more variation in angiosperm pits than previously thought. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for 21 collections of Berberis and one each of Epimedium, Jeffersonia, and Nandina. Most species of Berberis have {{large numbers of}} narrow vessels ~ixed with vasicentric tracheids. Scalariform perforation plates are reported here only for Epimedium, m wh 1 ch they are occasional. Berberidaceae have living fibers (Berberis), <b>fiber-tracheids</b> plus living fibers (Nandina), or tracheids (Jeffersonia) as imperforate tracheary elements. Axial parenchyma is reported here for Jeffersonia and one species of Berberis. Previous reports of axial parenchyma in Berberis and Nandina likely refer to undivided living fibers, mostly intermixed with vessels, which are slightly shorter and with thinner walls and larger pit apertures than living fibers elsewhere in the wood. Woods of Berberis and other Berberidaceae are remarkably xeromorphic. The wide, tall rays of Berbendaceae, other than Jeffersonia, resemble rays of Clematis (Ranunculaceae) and other Ranunculiflorae. In dimensions, these rays suggest herbaceousness, but abundance of procumbent cells in these rays is not juvenilistic. No consistent differences in wood separate the subgenera Berberis and Mahonia of Berberis: although the two subgenera differ modally in several respects. Wood anatomy of Nandma IS {{very similar to that}} of Berberis, and segregation of Nandinaceae is unwarranted on the basis of wood anatomy...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data were offered for 30 taxa of Meliosma and one species each of Ophiocaryon and Sabia; qualitative data {{were available for}} additional species of Meliosma and Sabia. For a small family restricted to mesic sites, Sabiaceae had {{a wide range of}} wood anatomical expressions (e. g., long scalariform to simple perforation plates; heterocellular to homocellular multiseriate rays; tracheids, <b>fiber-tracheids,</b> or libriform fibers as imperforate tracheary elements; presence or absence of silica bodies and calcium oxalate crystals in rays). Growth ring type, vessel diameter, vessel density, and vessel element length were sensitively related to ecology, but to degree of winter cold rather than to aridity. Ophiocaryon differed somewhat from all or most species of Meliosma in quantitative features, but the genera agreed in qualitative features. Some authors segregate these arborescent or arboreal genera in Meliosmaceae because of distinctive features of Sabia, a liana genus; wood of lianas differs in anatomy from that of trees, and these features account for the wood differences between Sabia and Meliosma. All wood features of Sabiaceae are widespread in the genera of Rutales (Sapindales), even scalariform perforation plates. Sabiaceae are therefore best placed in Rutales, although wood of Sabiaceae is modally more primitive than that of other Rutales. Characters restricted to particular species were cited, but designation of them as diagnostic criteria was not advocated because the sampling of the family was rather incomplete...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} the single species of Canacomyrica (hitherto not studied) shows that it belongs in Myricaceae, {{although}} it differs from other genera in several respects (axial parenchyma grouped in bands or columns as well as diffuse; Heterogeneous Type I rays; more numerous bars per perforation plate). The latter two features are primitive for the family. The four genera (Canacomyrica. Comptonia, Morella, and Myrica s. s.) differ from each other not only by qualitative features but by quantitative features (feature means in genera mostly non- overl apping). Wood of Comptonia and Myri ca s. s. lacks chambered crystals in axial parenchyma and ray crystals. Wood of Myrica s. s. has tracheids in latewood but <b>fiber-tracheids</b> in earl ywood. Diagnostic generic summaries are presented. Features of Myricaceae such as scalarifom perforation plates, presence of (true) tracheids, ray types, chambered encapsulated crystals in axial parenchyma, and bark anatomy correspond with character states and expressions in Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, Corylaceae, Juglandaceae (including Rhoipteleaceae), Ticodendraceae and, to a lesser extent, Fagaceae and Nothofagaceae. This grouping of families can be found as Fagales in recent DNA trees. The predominance of tracheids in basal Fagales such as Myricaceae and Ticodendraceae suggests that origin of vasicentric tracheids which occur in combination with libriform fibers in Fagaceae {{is the product of}} tracheid dimorphism. Low imperforate tracheid length to vessel element length ratios (FN ratios) in Myricaceae are a probable indication of wood primitiveness. Quantitative vessel features of Myricaceae, as combined in Mesomorphy Ratio values, characterize wood of Myricaceae as a whole, but at the species level such values correspond to respective habitats; notably high vessel density in Comptonia may represent greater conductive safety appropriate to relatively dry habitats...|$|R
40|$|Vessel {{grouping}} {{is a form}} of non-random distribution {{that becomes}} functionally valuable when the background consists of non-conductive imperforate tracheary elements (<b>fiber-tracheids</b> and libriform fibers); ungrouped vessels, randomly placed, often occur in an all-tracheid background. Types of vessel grouping are described and illustrated: diagonal, tangential, radial, median radial bands, and growth rings. Other non-random distributions considered include degrees and kinds of cable construction, patchy vessel distributions, vessel displacement related to succulence, and patterns involving successive cambia. Non-random vessel distributions inevitably involve non-random placement of imperforate tracheary elements, so that a parallel set of mechanical adaptations is often simultaneously achieved. Correlations between various types of non-random vessel patterns and possible physiological factors are hypothesized. Most correlations involve enhanced conductive safety, but vessel distribution related to water and photosynthate storage, resistance to torsion, and increased longevity of xylem are cited. Non-randomness of vessels is a source of diversity in wood structure that can be achieved readily (as growth rings show) and polyphyletically. These modifications offer numerous ways in which wood histology can be repatterned for probable adaptations in conductive physiology, mechanical strength, and storage capability, perhaps by means of regulatory genes. Grouping of vessels into vascular bundles in primary xylem of stems and leaves in dicots {{is a form of}} non-randomness, and the significance of vascular bundles (as opposed to steles) as adaptive forms of organization is considered briefly. Monocots differ from dicots in rarely having division of labor in tracheary elements within an organ, but monocots exhibit tradeoffs in which conductive efficiency (vessel presence in an organ) and conductive safety (tracheids but no vessels in an organ) can be achieved within a single plant...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{collections}} representing {{one species}} each of Symbolanthus and Tachia, and 17 species of Macrocarpaea were studied {{by means of}} light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Wood details show that the three genera form a coherent group; Tachia differs from the others {{in only a few}} minor characters. Because the species studied form a natural group, wood variations within Helieae offer the basis for correlations and interpretations with respect to habit and ecology. Diameter of stems studied proves to be an important variable that must be taken into account. Correlations with stem diameter include wider vessels in outer wood of wider samples. This would correspond to deeper penetration of reliable water tables by roots of helioid trees or large shrubs. Ray height decreases with increase in stem diameter, an indication of paedomorphosis. Rays of all species are paedomorphic in histology by virtue of relative paucity or even absence of procumbent cells in multiseriate rays. Pseusoscalariform lateral wall pitting of vessels is also a feature characteristic of paedomorphosis. The assemblage of paedomorphic features correlates well with the conclusion, reached by authors who used cladistic methods, that Gentianaceae other than Gentianeae are derived from suffrutescent prennials. The Mesomorphy Ratio, which incorporates three vessel features, correlates with leaf length and with stem diameter. All Helieae are mesophytic, but to various degrees. Septate <b>fiber-tracheids,</b> where present, are typically near vessels and form a substitute for or an addendum to vasicentric axial parenchyma as a mechanism for photosynthate storage. Vestured pits occur on lateral wall pits of vessels of all Helieae, but not on the fibertracheids. Vestured pits show diversity within Macrocarpaea, a feature of possible systematic significance...|$|R
40|$|Wood of Caryophyllaceae is {{more diverse}} {{than has been}} appreciated. Imperforate tracheary {{elements}} may be tracheids, <b>fiber-tracheids,</b> or libriform fibers. Rays may be uniseriate only, multiseriate only, or absent. Roots of some species (and sterns of {{a few of those}} same genera) have vascular tissue produced by successive cambia. The diversity in wood anatomy character states shows a range from primitive to specialized so great that origin close to one of the more specialized families of Chenopodiales, such as Chenopodiaceae or Amaranthaceae, is unlikely. Caryophyllaceae probably branched from the ordinal clade near the clade 2 ̆ 7 s base, as cladistic evidence suggests. Raylessness and abrupt onset of multiseriate rays may indicate woodiness in the family is secondary. Successive cambia might also be a subsidiary indicator of secondary woodiness in Caryophyllaceae (although not necessarily dicotyledons at large). Although a small shrub, Gymnocarpos may be primitively woody, and because that genus appears primitive in many wood features the family as a whole may derive from woody ancestors, despite apparent secondary woodiness in many phylads. Systematic distribution of wood character states in the family corresponds closely to the Pax and Hoffmann system of three tribes and their progressive degrees of specialization (Paronychieae, Alsineae, Sileneae). Wood data support the idea that Caryophyllaceae represent a branch from near the base of the order Caryophyllales. Wood of Caryophyllaeeae is highly xeromorphic, comparable in quantitative vessel features to wood of desert shrubs; insular species have less xeromorphic wood. Instances of storying and druse presence in axial and ray parenchyma are newly reported for the family, as is the inverted orientation of xylem, phloem, and periderm produced by a cambium at the periphery of the pith in Dianthus caryophyllus...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} features are presented for 28 collections of three genera (Bontia, Eremophila, Myoporum); data on Oftia are also included {{since it is}} sometimes referred to Myoporaceae. Wood of all Myoporaceae represents variation on a basic plan: woods diffuse porous or semi-ringporous; vessels with simple perforation plates; lateral wall pits of vessels alternate and circular, with grooves interconnecting some pit apertures; vessels grouped to various degrees into radial multiples; imperforate tracheary elements all <b>fiber-tracheids</b> with pit cavities 1 - 5 μm in diameter (wider on contacts with ray cells), nonseptate; axial parenchyma vasicentric scanty plus, in some species, tangential para tracheal bands (sometimes terminal); rays multi seriate plus uniseriate (uniseriate almost exclusively in two species of Eremophila); ray cells procumbent exclusively, upright and square in uniseriate rays and in tips of multiseriate rays; rays storied in some species of Eremophila, axial parenchyma variously storied; crystals present in ray cells of some species of Eremophila and in fibers of E. polyclada; amorphous deposits and starch often present in parenchyma. Ofiia differs from Myoporaceae by having: septate libriform fibers rather than fiber-tracheids; large pits on vessel walls; axial parenchyma nearly absent; and erect cells predominant in rays. Oftia may be placed in Scrophulariaceae. Leucophyllum differs from Myoporaceae by having: helical thickenings in vessels; vasicentric tracheids transitional from vascular tracheids; scarce axial parenchyma; and erect cells predominant in rays. Leucophyllum may be excluded from Myoporaceae. Wood anatomy ofMyoporaceae shows relationship between Myoporaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and Gesneriaceae, and is also indicative of derivation from woody ancestors. Wood of Myoporaceae reflects xeromorphy, especially in Eremophila, but the foliar apparatus may partially preempt the role of wood in promoting safety, which is connoted by growth rings, narrow and numerous vessels, and grouped vessels...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphological}} {{taxonomy of}} the Symplocaceae in Taiwan was studied {{according to the}} characters of pollen, venation, and wood. According to pollen morphology and sculpture, the Symplocaceae was classified into two types and seven subtypes. The results of the wood anatomy indicated that all species {{divided into two groups}} in terms of the existence of the spiral thickening on vessel walls and <b>fiber-tracheids.</b> The results of numerical taxonomy based on the 127 morphological characters were coincident with the morphological methods. Among the 28 species of Symplocaceae in Taiwan, 11 species have been found in mainland China, 8 species in Ryukus, 4 species in Japan, and 1 species in Philippines. This study concluded that there was one genus(Symplocos), including two subgenus and 28 species(including variety), in the family in Taiwan. Only one species(S. sonoharae var. formosana) was classified to subgen. Symplocos, and the other 27 species were categorized as to subgen. Hopea. The species of subgen. Hopea were further classified into eight sections: sect. Palura, sect. Lodhra, sect. Bobua, sect. Lancifoliae, sect. Glaucae, sect. Glomeratae, sect. Palaeosymplocos, sect. Wikstroemifoliae C. C. Wang sect. nov [...] The key, note on habitat, general distribution maps, synonyms, and description for each species and variety were presented in this paper. 本研究檢視臺灣產灰木科植物之標本，並觀察各分類群之形態特徵，包括花粉粒形態與表面雕紋、葉脈特徵分析及木材顯微構造觀察，並描述本科植物與鄰近地區之關係及在臺灣的分布模式。 根據花粉粒特徵之研究結果，可將臺灣產灰木科植物區分為 2 型 7 亞型；依木材導管是否具有螺旋狀增厚特徵可區分為 2 型。根據各分類群之 127 個性狀資料，以數據分類所得之歸群結果和形態分類之結果頗為一致。就臺灣自生的灰木科 28 種植物種類而言，其中有 11 種與中國大陸的種類相同，琉球次之(8 種亦見於琉球) ，再次為日本(4 種) ，僅有蘭嶼灰木(S. cochinchinensis var. philippensis) 1 種亦產於菲律賓。 本研究主張將臺灣的灰木科植物區分為灰木屬 (Symplocos) 1 屬；灰木亞屬(subgen. Symplocos) 、深裂灰木亞屬(subgen. Hopea) 2 亞屬及 28 種(含變種) ，其中臺灣南嶺灰木歸於灰木亞屬，其餘 27 種歸於深裂灰木亞屬。並可進一步將深裂灰木亞屬劃分為錐序節(sect. Palura) 、光頂山礬節(sect. Lodhra) 、球果山礬節(sect. Bobua) 、披針葉山礬節(sect. Lancifoliae) 、山羊耳節(sect.

40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} features {{of wood and}} stem anatomy are presented for 44 collections of 16 genera and 35 species ofConvolvulaceae. Markedly furrowed xylem characterizes the genera of tribe Cresseae. Successive cambia occur in 11 of the genera studied. Large patches of axial parenchyma occur in many of these; only in one species was interxylary phloem (formed internally by the cambium) observed in the parenchyma patches. Intraxylary phloem at {{the periphery of the}} pith is universal in Convolvulaceae, but newly reported is the fact that in many species, cambial activity adds secondary phloem to the intraxylary phloem strands. These cambia were also observed to add limited amounts of secondary xylem externally in Ericybe and Operculina. Fragmentation of the vascular cylinder by growth from the inner cambia leads to initiation of radially oriented cambia (ray cambia) along the ray zone where fracture occurs. Three new types of vessel restriction patterns (nonrandom distribution of vessels in wood or absence of vessels within some parts of the secondary xylem) are reported for the family (and dicotyledons). Rays are predominantly uniseriate; ray histology and quantitative vessel features show little change ontogenetically in species with successive cambia, suggesting that this cambial mode deters the kinds of progressive changes that occur in dicotyledons with a single cambium. Vessels are much wider in lianoid Convolvulaceae than in shrubby species; the lianoid species of Ipomoea have vessels twice the diameter of those in arborescent species of Ipomoea. Conjunctive parenchyma may serve for water storage in I. arborescens and other species, but this tissue and abundance of axial parenchyma in lianas might also aid flexibility and damage resistance. Septate <b>fiber-tracheids</b> and septate libriform fibers occur in a few species and represent tracheid dimorphism. Occurrence of tracheids together with fibriform vessel elements in woods of many Convolvulaceae suggests relationship of Convolvulaceae to Polemoniaceae and Hydrophyllaceae; intraxylary phloem and other wood features suggest relationship between Convolvulaceae and Solanaceae...|$|R
40|$|Types of xylem {{histology}} in vines, {{rather than}} types of cambial activity and xylem conformation, form {{the focus of}} this survey. Scandent plants are high in conductive capability, but therefore have highly vulnerable hydrosystems; this survey attempts to see what kinds of adaptations exist for safety and in which taxa. A review of scandent dicotyledons reveals that a high proportion possesses vasicentric tracheids (22 families) or true tracheids (24 families); the majority of scandent families falls in these categories. Other features for which listings are given include vascular tracheids, fibriform vessel elements, helical sculpture in vessels, starch-rich parenchyma adjacent to vessels, and other parenchyma distributions. The high vulnerability of wide vessels is held to be countered by various mechanisms. True tracheids and vasicentric tracheids potentially safeguard the hydrosystem by serving when large vessels are embolized. Many vines and lianas have many narrow vessel elements (often fibriform vessel elements) in addition to wide vessel elements. The narrow vessel elements are held to increase safety. In comparing scandent with nonscandent genera within a family, one finds in some cases that tracheids occur in the scandent species, whereas <b>fiber-tracheids</b> or libriform fibers occur in the nonscandent ones. The same is true of vasicentric tracheids in vining species as compared to nonvining relatives; vasicentric tracheids are so abundant in some families (Passifloraceae) that libriform fibers have been lost partially or wholly. New familial records for presence of vasicentric tracheids include Cucurbitaceae and Polygonaceae, and new generic records include Antigonon, Lycopersicon, and Mandevilla. Various xylem features suggest presence of auxiliary conductive capabilities when main vessels fail. Parenchyma distributions in vines, especially those in which parenchyma surrounds fiber-sheathed vessels, may offer mechanical flexibility in vines, just as presence of wide rays does. However, starch-rich axial parenchyma adjacent to vessels may provide not merely a means of storing to facilitate growth events but, additionally, a way in which hydrolysis of starch could result in movement of sugar into vessels, permitting osmotic entry of water into given areas. Adaptations which seem to lend safety to the hydrosystem are much less in vines and lianas of perpetually moist tropical regions than they are in taxa subject to periods of drought or frost...|$|R
