40|$|In 1990 Flödeskommittén {{released}} {{new guidelines}} which redefined {{the method used}} to determine design flows. The method, combined with more complete measurements of flow variations, has resulted in higher design flows which in turn call for increases in the discharge capacity of hydropower plants. This work is still in progress. Since many Swedish hydropower stations were constructed in the 1950 's and 60 's they require modernization. Today Statkraft owns and operates 55 hydropower stations in Sweden several of which have a discharge capacity below the design flow. For this reason, the dam safety of these hydropower stations is reduced. According to current guidelines the turbine flow is not added to the discharge capacity since {{the availability of the}} electrical grid is not guaranteed during extreme flows. When the electric grid is unavailable the generator has no load and cannot produce an electric torque. Without the electric torque the turbine accelerates which may result in equipment failure. This thesis considers the introduction of an alternative local load where the generator power can be dumped as heat, hence termed <b>dump</b> <b>load.</b> The <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> has the potential to increase the discharge capacity by adding the turbine flow. However, operation of the <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> requires the availability of the generator and turbine, making the discharge capacity dependent on the status of the plant. In turn, achieving a sufficient discharge capacity is of primary concern to dam operators since it determines dam safety. Consequently, this thesis evaluates the effects on dam safety when utilizing a local load to increase the discharge capacity. Three different designs were evaluated; a medium to high voltage electrode water boiler, electrodes submerged in the river and a low voltage electric water boiler. The evaluation shows that all three designs are feasible and can be used to increase the discharge capacity provided the generator and turbine have high availability. The complexity and number of components constituting the <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> should be minimized {{to reduce the risk of}} malfunctions and redundancy should be introduced for key components when feasible. The <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> power should be controlled using voltage regulation but further work is required to determine the specifics of this governor. The results also show that the cost of the <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> is a fraction of the cost of a new spillway. However, the topic is controversial and the <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> requires practical testing in order to evaluate operational reliability...|$|E
40|$|AbstractConstant voltage and {{frequency}} can be generated by a Self-Excited Induction Generator (SEIG) driven with a fixed-speed low-head hydro-turbine when a constant electrical load is maintained by an Electronic Load Controller (ELC). In the Conventional-ELC (C-ELC), usually a chopper with a <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> is used in parallel with the consumer loads to provide regulation of voltage and control of frequency. In the C-ELC configuration {{a high degree of}} stress can be experienced by stator windings and excitation capacitors resulting from chopper operation, since in each chopping period the <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> is connected to the stator winding for a short period then disconnected. A new ELC topology is proposed to reduce this stress. Compared with the C-ELC, the main <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> has been divided into two separated parts. A part of the <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> can be connected in parallel with the consumer loads, resulting in less variation in the total load seen by the SEIG and less stress on the stator windings and excitation capacitors. This proposed topology can be utilized per-phase using bi-directional power switches, hence it can operate with unbalanced consumer loads. Simulation results demonstrate that even with unbalanced three-phase loads (assisted with bi-directional switches per-phase), the proposed topology has the capability to regulate voltage from no-load to full load. Moreover, the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) analysis for output (stator) current shows a 9 % improvement compared with the most recent results in the literature...|$|E

50|$|A {{side dump}} truck (SDT) {{consists}} of a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle semi-trailer. It has hydraulic rams which tilt the dump body onto its side, spilling the material to either {{the left or right}} side of the trailer. The key advantages of the side dump are that it allows rapid unloading and can carry more weight in the western United States. In addition, it is almost immune to upset (tipping over) while dumping, unlike the semi end dumps which are very prone to tipping over. It is, however, highly likely that a side dump trailer will tip over if dumping is stopped prematurely. Also, when dumping loose materials or cobble sized stone, the side dump can become stuck if the pile becomes wide enough to cover too much of the trailer's wheels. Trailers that dump at the appropriate angle (50° for example) avoid the problem of the <b>dumped</b> <b>load</b> fouling the path of the trailer wheels by <b>dumping</b> their <b>loads</b> further {{to the side of the}} truck, in some cases leaving sufficient clearance to walk between the <b>dumped</b> <b>load</b> and the trailer.|$|R

Simple models for different system components are developed, integrated, and used to predict the behavior of generating systems based on available wind/solar and load data. The model is useful for evaluating the performance of stand-alone generating systems and gaining a better insight in the component sizes needed before they are built.

40|$|Murdoch University’s Renewable Energy Power Systems (REPS) Facility is {{designed}} to give students a practical understanding of how a stand-alone power system operates. The facility allows students and faculty to monitor, adjust and observe a range of system components in the energy generation process. The facility {{is designed}} to manage the power generation of two wind turbines with the option of isolation through a switch located on the main wall of the facility. The Soma 1 kW wind turbine has been erected and placed {{on top of the}} previous Ginlong WT tower and requires integration into the facility. This involved the current WB inverter to be checked for compatibility as well as its existing parameters to be changed to allow for the new turbine to be compatible. The SOMA turbine’s controller and <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> location inside the facility needed to be connected (Fig 3). The housing for the controller remained in its position on the main wall of the facility whilst the <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> was removed from the controller and secured inside the previous Ginlong <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> housing on the outside wall of the building. The separation of the dump resistor was needed for it posed a safety concern in its previous location.
