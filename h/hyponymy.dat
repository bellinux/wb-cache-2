40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for the semi-automatic, uniform extraction of synonymies, <b>hyponymies,</b> overlappings and homonymies holding among concepts of different XML Schemas. The proposed approach is specialized for XML, is almost automatic and “light”. As a further, original, peculiarity, it is parametric w. r. t. a “severity level ” {{against which the}} extraction task is performed. First the paper {{presents an}} overview of the interschema property extraction approaches already presented in the past, as well as a set of criteria for classifying this kind of approaches. After this, it describes the proposed approach in all details, illustrates various theoretical results, presents the experiments we have performed for testing it and compares it with the interschema property extraction approaches previously proposed in the literature.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{illustrate}} an approach for clustering semantically heterogeneous XML Schemas. The proposed approach {{is driven by}} the semantics of the involved Schemas that is defined by means of the interschema properties existing among concepts represented therein; interschema properties taken into account by our approach are synonymies (indicating that two concepts have the same meaning), <b>hyponymies</b> (denoting that a concept has a more specific meaning than another one), and overlappings (indicating that two concepts are neither synonyms nor one hyponym of the other, but represent, to some extent, the same reality). An important feature of our approach consists of its capability of being integrated with almost all the clustering algorithms already proposed in the literature. Both a theoretical and an experimental analysis on the complexity of our approach are presented in the paper. They show that our approach is scalable and particularly suited in application contexts characterized by a great number and a large variety of XML Schemas. ...|$|R
25|$|First {{proposed}} by Trier in the 1930s, semantic field theory proposes {{that a group}} of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a semantic field. The words boil, bake, fry, and roast, for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of cooking. Semantic field theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words. Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between lexemes, including synonymy (big and large), antonymy (big and small), hypernymy and <b>hyponymy</b> (rose and flower), converseness (buy and sell), and incompatibility. Semantic field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{relations}} of <b>hyponymy</b> and incompatibility, taxonomic hierarchical structures too can be formed. It consists of two relations; the first one being exemplified in 'An X is a Y' (simple <b>hyponymy)</b> while the second relation is 'An X is a kind/type of Y'. The second relation {{is said to be}} more discriminating and can be classified more specifically under the concept of taxonomy.|$|E

50|$|Lexical items {{participate}} in regular patterns of association with each other. Some relations between lexical items include <b>hyponymy,</b> hypernymy, synonymy and antonymy, {{as well as}} homonymy.|$|E
50|$|In English, WordNet is {{an example}} of a {{semantic}} network. It contains English words that are grouped into synsets. Some semantic relations between these synsets are meronymy, <b>hyponymy,</b> synonymy and antonymy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{analysis}} of synonymy, polysemy, <b>hyponymy,</b> and hypernymy is inherent to taxonomy and ontology in the information-science senses of those terms. It has applications in pedagogy and machine learning, because {{they rely on}} word-sense disambiguation and [...]|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyponymy</b> is {{the most}} {{frequently}} encoded relation among synsets used in lexical databases such as WordNet. These semantic relations {{can also be used}} to compare semantic similarity by judging the distance between two synsets and to analyse Anaphora.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{related to}} work et al. are {{concerned}} with two areas: constraint-based data mining algorithms applied in Web Usage Mining and developed software tools (systems). Costa and Seco demonstrated that web log mining {{can be used to}} extract semantic information (<b>hyponymy</b> relationships in particular) about the user and a given community.|$|E
5000|$|Hypernyms and {{hyponyms}} are asymmetric. <b>Hyponymy</b> can {{be tested}} by substituting X and Y in the sentence ‘X {{is a kind of}} Y’ and determining if it makes sense. [...] For example, ‘A screwdriver is a kind of tool’ makes sense but not ‘A tool is a kind of screwdriver’.|$|E
5000|$|Polysemy is {{a pivotal}} concept within {{disciplines}} such as media studies and linguistics. The analysis of polysemy, synonymy, and <b>hyponymy</b> and hypernymy {{is vital to}} taxonomy and ontology in the information-science senses of those terms. It has applications in pedagogy and machine learning, because they rely on word-sense disambiguation and [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{hierarchical}} structure of semantic fields can be mostly seen in <b>hyponymy.</b> They could be observed {{from top to}} bottom, where the higher level is more general and the lower level is more specific. For example, living things will be the highest level followed by plants and animals, and the lowest level may comprise dog, cat and wolf.|$|E
5000|$|Step 1 {{requires}} assembling word {{frequencies and}} information on semantic relationships, specifically <b>hyponymy.</b> Moving upwards in word hierarchy, a cumulative concept frequency is calculating by adding a sum of hyponyms' frequencies to frequency of their hypernym: where [...] is a hypernym of [...]Then, a desired number of words with top cumulated frequencies are chosen to build a targed lexicon.|$|E
50|$|Polish synsets are {{connected}} to the corresponding Princeton WordNet synsets with a set of inter-lingual lexico-semantic relations (such as for instance synonymy, partial synonymy, <b>hyponymy).</b> 91 578 synsets have been mapped so far (which amounts to about 2/3 of plWordNet synsets, among which mainly nouns). The mapping enables the application of plWordNet in machine translation, e.g. in the online service offered by Google Translate.|$|E
5000|$|Brinton (2000: p. 112) defines [...] "semantic field" [...] or [...] "semantic domain" [...] and {{relates the}} {{linguistic}} concept to hyponymy:"Related {{to the concept}} of <b>hyponymy,</b> but more loosely defined, is the notion of a semantic field or domain. A semantic field denotes a segment of reality symbolized by a set of related words. The words in a semantic field share a common semantic property." ...|$|E
5000|$|Semantic {{analysis}} can {{begin with the}} relationship between individual words. This requires an understanding of lexical hierarchy, including <b>hyponymy</b> and hypernymy, meronomy, polysemy, synonyms, antonyms, and homonyms. It also relates to concepts like connotation (semiotics) and collocation, which is the particular combination of words that can be or frequently are surrounding a single word. This can include idioms, metaphor, and simile, like, [...] "white as a ghost." ...|$|E
50|$|As of 2012, YAGO2s has {{knowledge}} {{of more than}} 10 million entities and contains more than 120 million facts about these entities. The information in YAGO is extracted from Wikipedia (e.g., categories, redirects, infoboxes), WordNet (e.g., synsets, <b>hyponymy),</b> and GeoNames. The accuracy of YAGO was manually evaluated to be above 95% on a sample of facts. To integrate it to the linked data cloud, YAGO {{has been linked to}} the DBpedia ontology and to the SUMO ontology.|$|E
5000|$|The {{notion of}} <b>hyponymy</b> is {{particularly}} relevant to language translation, as hyponyms are very common across languages. For example, in Japanese {{the word for}} older brother is [...] (ani), and the word for younger brother is [...] (otōto). An English-to-Japanese translator presented with a phrase containing the English word brother would have to choose which Japanese word equivalent to use. This would be difficult, because abstract information (such as the speakers' relative ages) is often not available during machine translation.|$|E
5000|$|In linguistics, is-a {{relations}} are called <b>hyponymy.</b> Words that describe categories are called hypernyms and {{words that are}} examples of categories are hyponyms. In the simple biology example dog is a hypernym and Fido {{is one of its}} hyponyms. A word can be both a hyponym and a hypernym. For example, dog is a hyponym of mammal and also a hypernym of Fido. In ATC programs {{one of the most important}} tasks is the discovery of hypernym and hyponym relations among words.|$|E
5000|$|Semantic lexicons {{are made}} up of lexical entries. These entries are not orthographic, but semantic, {{eliminating}} issues of homonymy and polysemy. These lexical entries are interconnected with semantic relations, such as hyperonymy, <b>hyponymy,</b> meronymy, or troponymy. Synonymous entries are grouped together in what the Princeton WordNet calls [...] "synsets" [...] Most semantic lexicons {{are made up}} of four different [...] "sub-nets": nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, though some researchers have taken steps to add an [...] "artificial node" [...] interconnecting the sub-nets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyponymy</b> is a {{transitive}} relation, if X is a hyponym of Y, and Y is a hyponym of Z, then X is a hyponym of Z. For example, violet is a hyponym {{of purple}} and purple is a hyponym of color; therefore violet is a hyponym of color. In addition, {{it should be}} noted that a word can be both a hypernym and a hyponym: for example purple is a hyponym of colour but itself is a hypernym of the broad spectrum of shades of purple between the range of crimson and violet.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} subtyping {{is related to}} the {{linguistic}} notions of <b>hyponymy</b> and holonymy. It is also related to the concept of bounded quantification in mathematical logic. Subtyping {{should not be confused with}} the notion of (class or object) inheritance from object-oriented languages; subtyping is a relation between types (interfaces in object-oriented parlance) whereas inheritance is a relation between implementations stemming from a language feature that allows new objects to be created from existing ones. In a number of object-oriented languages, subtyping is called interface inheritance, with inheritance referred to as implementation inheritance.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} {{and maintenance of}} a taxonomy is a knowledge-intensive task requiring significant time and resources. Also, domain modelers have their {{own point of view}} which inevitably, even if unintentionally, work their way into the model. ATC uses artificial intelligence techniques to automatically generate a taxonomy for a domain in order to avoid these problems. There are several approaches to ATC. One approach is to use rules to detect patterns in the corpus and use those patterns to infer relations such as <b>hyponymy.</b> Other approaches use machine learning techniques such as Bayesian inferencing and Artificial Neural Networks.|$|E
50|$|As is true {{throughout}} oncology (the {{study of}} tumors, malignant and benign), the nomenclature for these tumors continually evolves {{on the basis}} of threads of consensus in the scientific literature regarding the tumors' classification (which is based on shared embryologic origins, clinicopathologic characteristics, and so on). As science advances, more is understood about how one can differentiate tumors that formerly seemed alike. For example, the scientific knowledge of tumor markers, genomics, and proteomics regularly advances. In this environment, tumor names may slip over the years between synonymity, <b>hyponymy</b> and hypernymy, and deprecation. Some terms that have been synonymous with teratoma include dysembryoma, teratoblastoma, organoid tumor, and teratoid tumor.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a {{semantic}} network is WordNet, a lexical database of English. It groups English words into sets of synonyms called synsets, provides short, general definitions, and records the various semantic relations between these synonym sets. Some {{of the most common}} semantic relations defined are meronymy (A is part of B, i.e. B has A as a part of itself), holonymy (B is part of A, i.e. A has B as a part of itself), <b>hyponymy</b> (or troponymy) (A is subordinate of B; A is kind of B), hypernymy (A is superordinate of B), synonymy (A denotes the same as B) and antonymy (A denotes the opposite of B).|$|E
5000|$|Semantic {{properties}} or meaning {{properties are}} {{those aspects of}} a linguistic unit, such as a morpheme, word, or sentence, {{that contribute to the}} meaning of that unit. Basic semantic properties include being meaningful or meaningless - for example, whether a given word is part of a language's lexicon with a generally understood meaning; polysemy, having multiple, typically related, meanings; ambiguity, having meanings which aren't necessarily related and anomaly, where the elements of a unit are semantically incompatible with each other, although possibly grammatically sound. Beyond the expression itself, there are higher-level semantic relations that describe the relationship between units: these include synonymy, antonymy, and <b>hyponymy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Marti Hearst is a {{professor}} in the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. She did early work in corpus-based computational linguistics, including some of the first work in automatingsentiment analysis, and word sense disambiguation. She invented an algorithm that became known as [...] "Hearst patterns" [...] which applies lexico-syntactic patterns to recognize <b>hyponymy</b> (ISA) relations with high accuracy in large text collections, including an early application of it to WordNet; this algorithm is widely used in commercial text mining applications including ontology learning. Hearst also developed early work in automatic segmentation of text into topical discourse boundaries, inventing a now well-known approach called TextTiling.|$|E
5000|$|... BabelNet (version 3.7) covers 271 languages, {{including}} all European languages, most Asian languages, and Latin. BabelNet 3.7 contains almost 14 million synsets and about 746 million word senses (regardless of their language). Each Babel synset contains 2 synonyms per language, i.e., word senses, on average. The semantic network includes all the lexico-semantic relations from WordNet (hypernymy and <b>hyponymy,</b> meronymy and holonymy, antonymy and synonymy, etc., totaling around 364,000 relation edges) {{as well as}} an underspecified relatedness relation from Wikipedia (totaling around 380 million relation edges). Version 3.7 also associates about 11 million images with Babel synsets and provides a Lemon RDF encoding of the resource, available via a SPARQL endpoint. 2.67 million synsets are assigned domain labels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyponymy</b> {{shows the}} {{relationship}} between a generic term (hypernym) and a specific instance of it (hyponym). A hyponym is a word or phrase whose semantic field is more specific than its hypernym. The semantic field of a hypernym, also known as a superordinate, is broader than that of a hyponym. An approach to {{the relationship between}} hyponyms and hypernyms is to view a hypernym as consisting of hyponyms. This, however, becomes more difficult with abstract words such as imagine, understand and knowledge. While hyponyms are typically used to refer to nouns, it can also be used on other parts of speech. Like nouns, hyponyms in verbs are words that refer to a broad category of actions. For example, verbs such as stare, gaze, view and peer can also be considered hyponyms of the verb look.|$|E
50|$|In linguistics, {{semantics}} is the subfield that {{is devoted}} to the study of meaning, as inherent at the levels of words, phrases, sentences, and larger units of discourse (termed texts, or narratives). The study of semantics is also closely linked to the subjects of representation, reference and denotation. The basic study of semantics is oriented to the examination of the meaning of signs, and the study of relations between different linguistic units and compounds: homonymy, synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, <b>hyponymy,</b> meronymy, metonymy, holonymy, paronyms. A key concern is how meaning attaches to larger chunks of text, possibly {{as a result of the}} composition from smaller units of meaning. Traditionally, semantics has included the study of sense and denotative reference, truth conditions, argument structure, thematic roles, discourse analysis, and the linkage of all of these to syntax.|$|E
