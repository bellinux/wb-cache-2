5|$|German glass {{ornaments}} {{were introduced}} to America by Frank Woolworth in the 1880s but such ornaments were produced under labor-intensive conditions and were expensive, with <b>few</b> <b>Americans</b> being able to afford {{more than one or}} two ornaments per year. On the eve of World War II, however, American companies began manufacturing inexpensive, mass-produced ornaments that made it possible for almost any American to have an extensive collection of Christmas ornaments for little cost within moments. With a few modifications, Corning Glass's light bulb machine could spit out 2,000 blank glass ornaments a minute that were then bought by ornament companies to be decorated, packaged and sold by the dozen.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Declaration was revived in the 1790s {{with the}} {{emergence}} of the United States's first political parties. Throughout the 1780s, <b>few</b> <b>Americans</b> knew or cared who wrote the Declaration. But in the next decade, Jeffersonian Republicans sought political advantage over their rival Federalists by promoting both the importance of the Declaration and Jefferson as its author. Federalists responded by casting doubt on Jefferson's authorship or originality, and by emphasizing that independence was declared by the whole Congress, with Jefferson as just one member of the drafting committee. Federalists insisted that Congress's act of declaring independence, in which Federalist John Adams had played a major role, was more important than the document announcing it. But this view faded away, like the Federalist Party itself, and, before long, the act of declaring independence became synonymous with the document.|$|E
5|$|In April, 1972 he was reassigned {{from the}} SAC to TAC {{and to the}} 42nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (42 TEWS), 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, at Korat, Thailand. He was {{familiar}} with targeting both SAC missiles and SAC airplanes, {{was one of the}} most knowledgeable missile and electronic counter-measures experts in Vietnam, and it is likely that his situation was quickly reported to U.S. intelligence services. Very <b>few</b> <b>Americans</b> remained on the ground in Vietnam, and the NVA made it a point to track particularly valuable personnel, even in Thailand. The North Vietnamese were probably supported by the Russians with decrypting American message traffic and they likely knew exactly who had parachuted into their midst. This ability was likely enabled by the then unknown American spy CWO John Anthony Walker, who had given the Soviets a radio cipher card and other high-value intelligence. Hambleton's capture would be a terrific blow to American airpower around the world and a huge prize for the North Vietnamese and indirectly, the Soviets. Hambleton said after the war that he felt sure if he were captured that he would never have been taken to Hanoi.|$|E

In 2003, London-based Kangol even acknowledged the popularity given its sixty-year-old brand by a young LL Cool J in 1983.|$|E
25|$|Ten Days That Shook the World (1919) {{is a book}} by the American {{journalist}} and socialist John Reed about the October Revolution in Russia in 1917, which Reed experienced firsthand. Reed followed many of the prominent Bolshevik leaders closely during his time in Russia. John Reed died in 1920, shortly after the book was finished, and {{he is one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>Americans</b> buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow, a site normally reserved only for the most prominent Soviet leaders.|$|E
25|$|On November 29, 2012, a House {{subcommittee}} met {{to consider}} replacing the dollar bill. This action took {{place after the}} seventh Government Accountability Office report on the subject.

Recent budgets passed by Congress have included provisions to prevent the Treasury Department from spending any of its funds to redesign the one dollar bill, largely because of potential cost impacts on the vending machine industry.|$|E

He exhibited Joan Miró, Marc Chagall, Alberto Giacometti, Jean Dubuffet, André Derain, Yves Tanguy, Le Corbusier, Paul Delvaux, Wifredo Lam, Jean-Paul Riopelle, Balthus, Leonora Carrington, Zao Wou Ki, Sam Francis, sculptors Theodore Roszak, Raymond Mason, and Reg Butler, and several other important artists, including the work of Henri Matisse.|$|E
25|$|Colonel William Chewett and Major William Allen of the 3rd York Regiment of militia {{tried to}} arrange a capitulation, {{assisted}} by Captain John Beverley Robinson, the acting Attorney General of Upper Canada. The process took time. The Americans were angry over their losses, particularly because {{they believed that the}} ship and fort had been destroyed after negotiations for surrender had already begun. Nevertheless, Colonel Mitchell of the 3rd U.S. Artillery agreed to terms. While they waited for Dearborn and Chauncey to ratify the terms, the surrendered militia were held prisoner in a blockhouse without food or even medical attention for the few wounded. Forsyth's company of the 1st U.S. Rifle Regiment was left as guard in the town. At this stage, <b>few</b> <b>Americans</b> had entered the town.|$|E
25|$|The RLAF {{began its}} {{operations}} as a liaison, logistics and transport unit. Its initial stock were a melange of French and American supplied rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft inherited from its predecessor, Aviation Laotienne. On 9 January 1961, the new RLAF was supplied with six AT-6 Texans {{as its first}} strike aircraft. Although these were quickly lost, they were replaced by five T-28 Trojans. Despite ongoing losses, the T-28 inventory would eventually burgeon under American auspices to 75 Trojans on board in 1973. It would also acquire ten AC-47 gunships for a time. Pilot procurement for the swelling fleet would always be problematic, with the inadequate roster of Lao and Hmong pilots being filled out with Thai mercenary pilots, and a <b>few</b> <b>Americans</b> from Air America. By the time American aid was withdrawn in 1973, dooming the force, the RLAF would total 180 aircraft, both fixed wing and helicopters.|$|E

500|$|In November 1972, {{the film}} opened to {{enthusiastic}} audiences at Radio City Music Hall, but it fared poorly in theaters. [...] Faced with a polarized political climate, <b>few</b> <b>Americans</b> {{were drawn to}} [...] "a cheery exercise in prerepublic civics". [...] Warner's efforts to promote the film were sometimes counterproductive. [...] During an interview with talk show host Merv Griffin, the elderly producer engaged in a lengthy tirade against [...] "pinko communists". [...] This would become Warner's only television interview.|$|E
500|$|The film {{did not do}} well at the {{domestic}} box office, however. As Angela Aleiss put it, [...] "The film's adventurous scenes were certainly impressive, but <b>few</b> <b>Americans</b> would be stirred by Inupiat survival in the far north." [...] To boost receipts, MGM changed the film's title to Eskimo Wife-Traders. But the change did not help, and MGM lost $236,000 on the film domestically. The film was released in the UK and Australia as Mala the Magnificent. The UK premiere was on October 20, 1934, and the Australian premiere on October 31, 1934.|$|E
500|$|The {{choice of}} Shevchenko {{as the subject}} for a statue was not without controversy. Opponents, such as The Washington Post {{editorial}} board, argued [...] "the Ukrainian poet is known to only a <b>few</b> <b>Americans,</b> he is the idol of the Soviet Communist Party, he is anti-Semitic and anti-Polish." [...] Following the strongly worded editorial's publication, there was a deluge of angry responses, including from members of Congress like Representatives Thaddeus J. Dulski of New York and Ed Derwinski of Illinois. [...] Derwinski said erecting a memorial to Shevchenko seemed appropriate when compared {{with some of the}} other statues in the city, such as those honoring Dante, Edmund Burke, and Jose de San Martin.|$|E

500|$|Texas {{was again}} {{considered}} a buffer province, this time between New Spain and the United States. In 1804, Spain planned to send thousands of colonists {{to increase the}} number of residents in Texas (then at 4,000Hispanic inhabitants). The plan was cancelled as the government did not have the money to relocate the settlers. The responsibility for defending Texas now rested with Nemesio Salcedo, who held the newly reopened position of Commandant General of the Internal Provinces. Salcedo promoted immigration to Texas, and a new town, Trinidad de Salcedo, was founded where the Trinity River intersected the road from San Antonio to Nacogdoches. For a brief time, Salcedo also allowed former Spanish subjects from Louisiana to come to Texas. A <b>few</b> <b>Americans</b> who had become naturalized Spaniards settled in Texas during that time. Salcedo warned, however, that [...] "'the foreigners are not and will not be anything but crows to pick out our eyes.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{image of}} two gunslingers with violent {{reputation}} squaring {{off in a}} street in a duel, where each draws his pistol and tries to kill the other, is a Hollywood invention. However, Wild West duels did occur in real life (though rarely) and as such are not entirely a myth. These duels were first recorded in the South, brought by emigrants to the American Frontier as a crude form of the [...] "code duello," [...] a highly formalized means of solving disputes between gentlemen with swords or guns that had its origins in European chivalry. By {{the second half of}} the 19th century, <b>few</b> <b>Americans</b> still fought duels to solve their problems, and became a thing of the past in the United States by the start of the 20th century. Writer Wyatt-Brown in his book [...] "Southern Honor: Ethics and Behavior in the Old South" [...] described dueling in the American frontier as a [...] "custom", and was primarily used for teenage disputes, rise in ranking, status and scapegoating.|$|E
500|$|Baker {{went on to}} {{make the}} {{experimental}} film Something Wild (1961), directed by her then-husband Jack Garfein. In this independent production, she plays a young college student from the Bronx who is raped one night in St. James Park, and later held captive by a Manhattan mechanic (Ralph Meeker) who witnessed her subsequent suicide attempt. In preparation for her role, Baker lived alone in a boarding house in New York's Lower East Side, and gained employment as a department-store salesgirl; her method approach to the role was profiled in Life in 1960. Critical reaction to the film was largely negative, though Film Quarterly cited it as [...] "the most interesting American film of its quarter," [...] and the most underrated film of 1961. However, its controversial depiction of rape led to critical backlash and public criticism, and the film has been credited by historians as nearly halting Baker's career. The same year, she portrayed Gwen Harold in Bridge to the Sun (1961), a production by MGM based on the 1957 best-selling autobiography of a Tennessee-born woman who married a Japanese diplomat (portrayed by James Shigeta) {{and became one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>Americans</b> to live in Japan during World War II. While only a modest success at the box office, the film was well received by critics and was America's entry at the Venice International Film Festival.|$|E
