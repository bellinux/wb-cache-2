40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} bounds on {{codes in}} spherical caps and related problems in geometry and coding theory. An {{extension of the}} Delsarte method is presented that relates upper bounds {{on the size of}} spherical codes to upper bounds on codes in caps. Several new upper bounds on codes in caps are derived. Applications of these bounds to estimates of the <b>kissing</b> <b>numbers</b> and one-sided <b>kissing</b> <b>numbers</b> are considered. It is proved that the maximum size of codes in spherical caps for large dimensions is determined by the maximum size of spherical codes, so these problems are asymptotically equivalent. 1...|$|R

40|$|The best {{previous}} lower bounds for <b>kissing</b> <b>numbers</b> in dimensions 25 through 31 {{were constructed}} using a set S with |S| = 480 of minimal vectors of the Leech Lattice, Λ_ 24, such that 〈 x, y 〉≤ 1 for any distinct x, y ∈ S. Then, a probabilistic argument based on applying automorphisms of Λ_ 24 gives more disjoint sets S_i of minimal vectors of Λ_ 24 {{with the same}} property. Cohn, Jiao, Kumar, and Torquato proved that these subsets give kissing configurations in dimensions 25 through 31 of given size linear in the sizes of the subsets. We achieve |S| = 488 by applying simulated annealing. We also improve the aforementioned probabilistic argument in the general case. Finally, we greedily construct even larger S_i's given our S of size 488, giving increased lower bounds on <b>kissing</b> <b>numbers</b> in R^ 25 through R^ 31. Comment: 15 page...|$|R

50|$|The <b>kissing</b> <b>number</b> {{problem can}} be {{generalized}} {{to the problem of}} finding the maximum number of non-overlapping congruent copies of any convex body that touch a given copy of the body. There are different versions of the problem depending on whether the copies are only required to be congruent to the original body, translates of the original body, or translated by a lattice. For the regular tetrahedron, for example, it is known that both the lattice <b>kissing</b> <b>number</b> and the translative <b>kissing</b> <b>number</b> are equal to 18, whereas the congruent <b>kissing</b> <b>number</b> is at least 56.|$|E

The extreme lattices in a fixed dimension of space d (d >= 8) are dominated by typical lattices that have similar packing properties, such as packing densities and <b>kissing</b> <b>numbers,</b> while the best and the worst packers are in the long tails of the distribution of the extreme lattices. We also study the validity of the recently proposed decorrelation principle, which has important implications for sphere packings in general. The degree to which extreme-lattice packings decorrelate as well as how decorrelation is related to the packing density and symmetry of the lattices as the space dimension increases is also investigated.
