5|$|Ajtony's {{ethnicity}} is debated. Historian Paul Stephenson {{described him}} as a Magyar chieftain; according to historian László Makkai, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> Kabar origin and his Turkic name may imply {{that he was a}} Pecheneg. In Romanian historiography, Ajtony has been considered the last member of a Romanian dynasty descended from Glad; historian Alexandru Madgearu wrote that the Latin name of Ajtony's seat (urbs Morisena) preserved a Romanian form.|$|E
5|$|He {{could not}} breathe {{for the first}} twenty minutes of his life. It is {{suggested}} that this deprivation may have caused him to develop Asperger's syndrome—some of his biographers, such as Mitchell Snay, maintain that this condition would account for his eccentric behaviors in later life. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> English descent, and his forebears included early settlers of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.|$|E
5|$|Majure {{was a man}} who {{yearned to}} please his passengers, and if he made them happy then he also made his airline happy. He had often spoken to friends about how {{important}} it was for him to get travelers to their destinations on time and how proud <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> USAir's on-time record. All the same, he was also portrayed as a by-the-book, cautious pilot.|$|E
60|$|Nor did {{the bold}} {{cast of the}} boy's mind offset his {{physical}} defects, as it invariably does in the biographies. On the contrary. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> afraid <b>of</b> his father. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> afraid <b>of</b> his school-teacher. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> afraid <b>of</b> dogs. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> afraid <b>of</b> guns. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> afraid <b>of</b> lightning. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> afraid <b>of</b> hell. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> afraid <b>of</b> girls.|$|R

5|$|Narihira {{combined}} all {{the qualities}} most admired in a Heian courtier: <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> high birth (a grandson of the Emperor Heizei), extremely handsome, a gifted poet, and an all-conquering lover. He was probably also an expert horseman, adept in arms, and a competent official. These {{aspects of his}} life are not emphasized in The Tales of Ise, but they distinguish Narihira from other heroes of Heian literature, including Genji.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Belgrade, he began writing poetry {{at an early}} age and {{published}} a number of literary reviews under a pseudonym while he was still a teenager. He rose to prominence during the Balkan Wars, writing about his experiences in territories newly retaken from the Ottoman Empire. The outbreak of World War I interrupted Bojić's studies at the University of Belgrade and forced him to postpone marrying his girlfriend, Radmila Todorović. The couple were separated in the chaos of war, and Bojić left Belgrade with his family and relocated to Niš, where he worked as a military censor and wrote articles for a local newspaper to pay his family's bills. In October 1915, the Serbian Army was overwhelmed by a combined Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and German invasion and forced to retreat to neutral Greece via Albania. Bojić and his younger brother joined the exodus, marching for several weeks through Kosovo, Montenegro and northern Albania, where they were finally reunited with Bojić's fiancée. Bojić was not allowed to accompany his brother and fiancée on a ship destined for Italy because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> fighting age, and had to continue marching to Greece without them.|$|E
5|$|According {{to friends}} and family, he had {{extensive}} historical knowledge and was deeply disillusioned {{with the reality of}} communist Poland. He supported the protesting students during the March 1968 Polish political crisis in Poland, printing bibuła leaflets and asking his daughter to distribute them. According to health professionals, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> sound mind, and fully rational, {{at the time of his}} suicide. Siwiec planned his self-immolation months in advance, writing out a last will in April, and leaving written and tape-recorded statements explaining his revulsion at both the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of Poland's participation in it.|$|E
50|$|According to some sources, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> Kurdish; {{according}} to Üzeyir Tekin, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> partial Albanian and Kurdish origin; and {{according to}} Hasan Celal Güzel, a friend <b>of</b> Aksu family, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> Turkish (Turkmen) origin.|$|R

5|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> royal blood, {{his family}} was {{relatively}} obscure and lived a comparatively normal life by royal standards. In 1852, however, George's father was designated the heir presumptive to the childless King Frederick VII of Denmark, and the family became princes and princesses of Denmark. George's siblings were Frederick (who succeeded their father as King of Denmark), Alexandra (who became wife of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom {{and the mother of}} King George V), Dagmar (who, as Empress Maria Feodorovna, was consort of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and the mother of Emperor Nicholas II), Thyra (who married Prince Ernest Augustus, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale) and Valdemar.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Johnson {{was born}} in Raleigh, North Carolina, on December 29, 1808, to Jacob Johnson (1778–1812) and Mary ("Polly") McDonough (1783–1856), a laundress. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. He had a brother William, four years his senior, and an older sister Elizabeth, who died in childhood. Johnson's birth in a log cabin was a {{political}} asset in the mid-19th century, and he would frequently remind voters of his humble origins. Jacob Johnson was a poor man, as had been his father, William Johnson, but he became town constable of Raleigh before marrying and starting a family. He died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell, shortly after rescuing three drowning men, when his son Andrew was three. Polly Johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family. Her occupation was then looked down on, as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied. There were even rumors that Andrew, who did not resemble his brother or sister, had been fathered by another man. Polly Johnson eventually remarried, to Turner Doughtry, who was as poor as she was.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the War of the First Coalition Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. With {{military}} rations unable to satisfy his large appetite, he would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. Suffering from exhaustion, he was hospitalised and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed an eel whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> normal size and appearance, and showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.|$|E
60|$|Of Inspector Malseigne we discern, {{by direct}} light, that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> 'of Herculean stature;' and infer, with probability, that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> truculent moustachioed aspect,--for Royalist Officers now leave the upper lip unshaven; that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> indomitable bull-heart; and also, unfortunately, of thick bull-head.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> should <b>be</b> <b>of</b> sound mind {{while making}} a contract. A person who <b>is</b> usually <b>of</b> unsound mind, but {{occasionally}} of sound mind, {{can make a}} contract when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> sound mind. Similarly if a person <b>is</b> usually <b>of</b> sound mind, but occasionally of unsound mind, may not make a valid contract when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> unsound mind.|$|R

5|$|Berger {{was acquitted}} under counts one, and two, and {{some parts of}} counts three, and five, and was also acquitted under count six. He was convicted under that part of count three {{relating}} {{to the murder of}} Mesny, and under those parts of count five relating to his involvement with the SS-Sonderkommando Dirlewanger, for being a conscious participant in the concentration camp program, and the conscription of nationals of other countries. He was also convicted under that part of count seven relating to the children and youth slave labour program, including the Heuaktion, and was also convicted under count eight. Judge Powers handed down a dissenting opinion, stating that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> the view that Berger was not responsible for the murder of Mesny.|$|E

5|$|John Jordan Crittenden {{was born}} September 10, 1787, near Versailles, Kentucky. He {{was the second}} child and first son of Revolutionary War veteran John Crittenden and his wife Judith Harris. John and Judith Crittenden had four sons and five daughters, {{all but one of}} whom survived infancy. On his father's side, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> Welsh ancestry, while his mother's family was French Huguenot.

Two of Crittenden's brothers, Thomas and Robert, became lawyers, while the third, Henry, was a farmer.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Desha {{was born}} to Robert and Eleanor (Wheeler) Desha in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, on December 9, 1768. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> part French Huguenot ancestry, and his {{ancestors}} had fled from France to Pennsylvania after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which had largely protected the Huguenots from religious persecution. He obtained a limited education in the state's rural schools. In July 1781, Desha's family relocated to Fayette County, Kentucky, and the following year, they settled {{in what was then}} known as Cumberland district near the present-day city of Gallatin, Tennessee. Desha's younger brother, Robert, would later represent Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|Karmal {{was born}} Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929, {{was the son}} of Muhammad Hussein Hashem, a Major General in the Afghan Army and former {{governor}} of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul. His ethnic background is disputed, some claim that he was Tajik who represented himself as a Ghilzai Pashtun but others claim that he descended from Hindu ancestors of Kashmir. In 1986, Karmal announced that he, and his brother Mahmud Baryalay, were Pashtun because their mother came from the Mullakhel branch of the Pashtuns. However, this was controversial, considering that lineage in Afghanistan is supposed to be traced through the father, not the mother. The accusation that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> Indian Muslim ancestry {{comes from the fact that}} his birthname, Sultan Hussein, is a common Indian Muslim name. In addition, Karmal's own father denied his own ethnicity; Karmal's father was a Tajik. To further confuse the matter, Karmal spoke Dari (Persian) and not Pashto.|$|E

5|$|Keynes's {{optimism}} {{was also}} cultural, in two senses: <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> {{the last generation}} raised by an empire still {{at the height of}} its power, and was also of the last generation who felt entitled to govern by culture, rather than by expertise. According to Skidelsky, the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of World War I provided a framework with which the well-educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation {{to each other and to}} life, enabling them to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems.|$|E
5|$|Licario {{was born}} in Karystos in Latin-held Euboea (Negroponte), from a Vicentian father and a local woman. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> humble origin, but able and ambitious.

The match was met with disapproval by Felisa's family. They {{secretly}} married, but the marriage was cancelled by her relatives. Fleeing from their wrath, Licario sought refuge in the fort of Anemopylae near Cavo D'Oro. He repaired the strong fortress, assembled {{a small group of}} followers, and began raiding the surrounding estates, belonging to the island's nobles.|$|E
