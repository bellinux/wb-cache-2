5|$|Most of {{the pocket}} boroughs {{abolished}} by the Reform Act belonged to the Tory Party. These losses were somewhat offset by {{the extension of the}} vote to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of £50. This clause, proposed by the Tory Marquess of Chandos, was adopted in the House of Commons despite opposition from the Government. The tenants-at-will thereby enfranchised typically voted as <b>instructed</b> <b>by</b> their landlords, who in turn normally supported the Tory party. This concession, together with the Whig Party's internal divisions and the difficulties faced by the nation's economy, allowed the Tories under Sir Robert Peel to make gains in the elections of 1835 and 1837, and to retake the House of Commons in 1841.|$|E
