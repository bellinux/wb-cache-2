This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution.|$|E

Research has examined 13 high achievers from various professions, {{all of whom had}} experienced challenges in the workplace and negative life events over the course of their careers but who had also been recognized for their great achievements in their respective fields. Participants were interviewed about everyday life in the workplace as well as their experiences with resilience and thriving. The study found six main predictors of resilience: positive and proactive personality, experience and learning, sense of control, <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>adaptability,</b> balance and perspective, and perceived social support. High achievers were also found to engage in many activities unrelated to their work such as engaging in hobbies, exercising, and organizing meetups with friends and loved ones.|$|E

25|$|Mutable: The mutable {{signs are}} Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. A native with mainly mutable signs are adaptable, {{co-operative}} and friendly. They can fit into almost any situation, {{put up with}} anything and turn any situation to their advantage. Mutable people can steer projects through periods of transition {{and bring them to}} a successful conclusion. Although gentle and likeable, mutable subjects seem to have more than their fair share of problems and can be selfish and ruthless when they feel threatened. These subjects may devote their lives to helping others, but they can often paradoxically be surprisingly selfish at the same time. Subjects lacking mutable signs may be unable to adapt to any kind of change and be particularly unhappy when faced with uncertainty. They need lots of notice before they will commit themselves to anything, and lack <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>adaptability.</b> They may also hold onto rigid and unchanging views. Planets in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses will help to compensate for this lack, and water signs in the chart will make up for the lack of intuition.|$|E
25|$|In Steven Johnson's book, Everything Bad Is Good for You, {{he argues}} that video games in fact demand far more from a player than {{traditional}} games like Monopoly. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, {{as well as how}} to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and HUDs. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>adaptability.</b> He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books. Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.|$|E

2500|$|From late 2005 through February 2007, Petraeus {{served as}} Commanding General of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center (CAC) located there. As {{commander}} of CAC, Petraeus {{was responsible for}} oversight of the Command and General Staff College and seventeen other schools, centers, and training {{programs as well as}} for developing the Army's doctrinal manuals, training the Army's officers, and supervising the Army's center for the collection and dissemination of lessons learned. During his time at CAC, Petraeus and Marine Lt. Gen. James N. Mattis jointly oversaw the publication of Field Manual 3–24, Counterinsurgency, the body of which was written by an extraordinarily diverse group of military officers, academics, human rights advocates, and journalists who had been assembled by Petraeus and Mattis. Additionally, at both Fort Leavenworth and throughout the military's schools and training programs, Petraeus integrated the study of counterinsurgency into lesson plans and training exercises. In recognition of the fact that soldiers in Iraq often performed duties far different from those for which they trained, Petraeus also stressed the importance of teaching soldiers how to think as well as how to fight, and the need to foster <b>flexibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>adaptability</b> in leaders. Petraeus called this change the most significant part of The Surge, saying in 2016 [...] "the surge that mattered most was the surge of ideas. It was the change of strategy, and in many respects, this represented quite a significant change to what it was we were doing prior to the surge." [...] Petraeus has been called [...] "the world's leading expert in counter-insurgency warfare". Later, having refined his ideas on counterinsurgency based on the implementation of the new counterinsurgency doctrine in Iraq, he published both in Iraq {{as well as in the}} Sep/Oct 2008 edition of Military Review his [...] "Commander's Counterinsurgency Guidance" [...] to help guide leaders and units in the Multi-National Force-Iraq.|$|E
