Particularly difficult prisoners were put to work hand pumping groundwater into the prison's reservoir. Known as cranking, it was especially despised by the prisoners. Staff disliked giving the lashings – in 1851, {{out of a total}} of 400 lashings ordered, 150 were remitted as the superintendent could not find anyone to undertake the task. The role was so disliked that <b>inducements</b> were offered, including extra pay or improved lodgings.|$|E

Within a few years, the Company realized that special measures which would afford a stimulus to colonization were indispensable.|$|E

40|$|Currently, most health {{researchers}} or donor organizations considerinducement as a {{vital part}} in promoting research. They propose benefits, such as post research free medical treatment, food, insurance facilities, or even cash, {{in order to meet}} sufficient number of subjects. So, <b>inducement</b> may influence one to participate in a research. Is it ethical to offer <b>inducement</b> to human subjects? What are the risks in such practice? What will happen if the donor agencies use subjects by hiding possible risks from them? When an <b>inducement</b> can satisfy ethical criteria? The CIOMS, FDA, and other ethical guidelines hold that <b>inducement</b> is unethical because it involves enough risk for voluntary informed consent. Supporting this position, a group of ethicists has argued that <b>inducement</b> undermines voluntariness especially when subjects are poor and vulnerable, and thus, unethical. In contrast to them, others argue that <b>inducement</b> contributes to discover new knowledge which can improve miserable condition of the poor. In their view, an <b>inducement</b> maintains all ethical criteria including subject’s autonomy, and therefore, morally permissible. The paper focuses this debate and analyzes both types ofargument. It examines whether <b>inducement</b> invalidate informed consent. Even if <b>inducement</b> may not violate the basic components of informedconsent, the paper concludes, subjects may claim a prima facie right to enjoy research outcomes...|$|R
5000|$|Tam {{was fully}} acquitted {{of the charge}} after trial before {{magistrate}} Gary K Y Lam on 27 May 2011, who [...] "drew a distinction between <b>inducement</b> {{to vote for a}} candidate and <b>inducement</b> to attend an electioneering activity". This distinction was further upheld when the case was heard on appeal in April 2012, with the judge Hon Lam J upholding the acquittal, in view of the point of law that: [...] "It is not enough for an advantage to be offered. It has to be offered as an <b>inducement.</b> And an <b>inducement</b> to do something else is not enough: it has to be an <b>inducement</b> this case to vote for a particular candidate the vote bribery charge to be upheld." [...] The offering of a free CPD talk to an audience of professional accountants was not judged to be of value enough to serve as an <b>inducement</b> to change voting preference; nor was the free nature of the talk itself considered an intention to induce to alter people's voting preferences, although it was found to be an <b>inducement</b> to members to attend a talk they might otherwise not have attended. In the words of the judgement in the Court papers: [...] "The conclusion that the Respondent Tam did exploit the CPD talk as an <b>inducement</b> to the electors to attend the tea-gathering (and to hear the speeches of Mrs Chan and herself) {{does not necessarily mean that}} she intended the CPD talk to be an <b>inducement</b> to vote for her... Section 11(1) itself makes it clear that offering an advantage and <b>inducement</b> are two different elements in the offence. Thus, a finding of advantage does not necessarily lead to a finding of inducement." [...] The Court upheld the acquittal and dismissed the appeal.|$|R

5|$|By {{this time}} Gilbert faced {{financial}} difficulty {{as an amateur}} cricketer. Most amateurs were from privileged backgrounds, whereas professionals mainly came from the working class. It was almost unthinkable for an amateur to become a professional, although many did receive financial <b>inducements</b> such as generous expenses and sinecure positions within county organisations. Unlike the Grace brothers, Gilbert {{did not have a}} profession outside cricket to provide a supplementary income allowing him to live comfortably. A solution seemed to arrive in 1880, when Fred Grace, the manager of the United South of England XI touring side and one of W. G. Grace's brothers, died and Gilbert took over his paid job as secretary. But the popularity of professional touring teams was already in decline, and the increasing number of matches between county teams attracted more interest. An indication of trouble came in 1882 when a professional cricketer took Gilbert to court over unpaid fees for an appearance in a match.|$|E
5|$|The SS was {{regarded}} as the NSDAP's elite unit. In keeping with the racial policy of Nazi Germany, {{in the early days}} all SS officer candidates had to provide proof of Aryan ancestry back to 1750 and for other ranks to 1800. Once the war started and it became more difficult to confirm ancestry, the regulation was amended to just proving the candidate's grandparents were Aryan, as spelled out in the Nuremberg Laws. Other requirements were complete obedience to the Führer and a commitment to the German people and nation. Himmler also tried to institute physical criteria based on appearance and height, but these requirements were only loosely enforced, and over half the SS men did not meet the criteria. <b>Inducements</b> such as higher salaries and larger homes were provided to members of the SS, since they were expected to produce more children than the average German family as part of their commitment to NSDAP doctrine.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a universal architecture for statistically based HUman GEsturing (HUGE) system, for producing and using statistical models for facial gestures based on {{any kind of}} <b>inducement.</b> As <b>inducement</b> we consider any kind of signal that occurs in parallel {{to the production of}} gestures in human behaviour and that may have a statistical correlation with the occurrence of gestures, e. g. text that is spoken, audio signal of speech, bio signals etc. The correlation between the <b>inducement</b> signal and the gestures is used to first build the statistical model of gestures based on a training corpus consisting of sequences of gestures and corresponding <b>inducement</b> data sequences. In the runtime phase, the raw, previously unknown <b>inducement</b> data is used to trigger (induce) the real time gestures of the agent based on the previously constructed statistical model. We present the general architecture and implementation issues of our system, and further clarify it through two case studies. We believe that this universal architecture is useful for experimenting with various kinds of potential <b>inducement</b> signals and their features and exploring the correlation of such signals or features with the gesturing behaviour. 1...|$|R

5|$|Joe Mercer, who {{was then}} {{coaching}} the England schools team, urged Busby to sign Edwards, who was also attracting interest from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa. Edwards signed for United as an amateur on 2 June 1952, but accounts of when he signed his first professional contract vary. Some reports state that it occurred on his 17th birthday in October 1953, but others contend that it took place a year earlier. Those accounts that favour the earlier date usually state that a club official, either Busby himself or coach Bert Whalley, arrived at the Edwards family home soon after midnight to secure the youngster's signature as early as possible, but other reports claim that this occurred when he signed his amateur contract. Wolves manager Stan Cullis was indignant at missing out on a highly touted local youngster and accused United of improperly offering financial <b>inducements</b> to Edwards or his family, but Edwards maintained that he {{had always wanted to}} play for the Lancashire team. To guard against the possibility that he might not make a success of his football career, he also began an apprenticeship as a carpenter.|$|E
5|$|Kerry {{returned}} to Australia in 1980 {{for the national}} championships and gained selection for the Moscow Olympics by winning the backstroke double. Kerry declined financial <b>inducements</b> and resisted political pressure from the government of Australia to boycott the Olympics in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He {{went on to win}} bronze in the 200m backstroke after missing the final in the 100m. The peak of his career came in the 4100m medley relay, where he led off the winning team. The race remains the only time that the United States did not win the event at the Olympics. After the games, Kerry took an extended break from the sport, before returning for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He claimed a bronze in the medley relay and came fifth in the 100m backstroke. He then retired and took up a television and modelling career in the United States. After returning to Australia, he ran and owned Dunhill Management, one of the largest recruiting firms in the nation, with his brother. In 2001, the Kerry brothers sold Dunhill for , with up to A$13.8million in additional payments depending on the success of the company. They later founded a new recruitment firm, K2.|$|E

40|$|Innovation <b>inducement</b> prizes {{have been}} used for centuries. In the United States, a recent federal policy change—the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 — {{clarified}} and simplified a path by which all federal agencies can offer innovation in-ducement prizes, thus intensifying interest in how government agencies can most effectively design and apply such prizes. This paper aims to review and synthesize the academic literature on innovation <b>inducement</b> prizes, to clarify what has been learned that is relevant to current policy discussions, and to highlight unresolved questions that would be fruitful areas for future academic research and policy experimentation. Relative to the existing literature, this paper aims to bridge two gaps. First, I synthesize the academic literature in this area with an eye toward drawing lessons for the types of innovation <b>inducement</b> prizes under consideration by federal agencies under the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act. Second, I discuss {{the problem of how to}} evaluate the success or failure of innovation <b>inducement</b> prizes, arguing that careful empirical evaluations of innovation <b>inducement</b> prizes are needed in order to provide guidance to federal agencies (and others) on how to most effectively apply and design innovation <b>inducement</b> prizes.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{contributes}} to {{the debate on the}} <b>inducement</b> of environmental innovations by analysing the extent to which endogenous <b>inducement</b> mechanisms spur the generation of greener technologies in contexts characterized by weak exogenous <b>inducement</b> pressures. In the presence of a fragile environmental regulatory framework, <b>inducement</b> can indeed be endogenous and environmental innovations may be spurred by firms' reactions to their direct or related environmental performance. Cross-sector analysis focuses on a panel of Italian regions, over the time span 2003 - 2007, and is conducted by implementing zero-inflated regression models for count data variables. The empirical results suggest that in a context characterized by a weak regulatory framework, such as the Italian one, environmental performance has significant and complementary within- and between-sector effects on the generation of green technologies...|$|R
