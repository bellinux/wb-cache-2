40|$|Abstract—The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to evaluate surface roughness and develop a multiple regression model for surface roughness as a function of cutting parameters during the turning of <b>flame</b> <b>hardened</b> medium carbon steel with TiN-Al 2 O 3 -TiCN coated inserts. An experimental plan of work and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) were used to relate the influence of turning parameters to the workpiece surface finish utilizing Taguchi methodology. The effects of turning parameters were studied by using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. Evaluated parameters were feed, cutting speed, and depth of cut. It was found that the most significant interaction among the considered turning parameters was between depth of cut and feed. The average surface roughness (Ra) resulted by TiN-Al 2 O 3 -TiCN coated inserts was about 2. 44 µm and minimum value was 0. 74 µm. In addition, the regression model was able to predict values for surface roughness in comparison with experimental values within reasonable limit.

50|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>hardening</b> {{is often}} used to harden only a portion of an object, by quickly heating it with a very hot flame in a {{localized}} area, and then quenching the steel. This turns the heated portion into very hard martensite, but leaves the rest unchanged. Usually, an oxy-gas torch is used to provide such high temperatures. <b>Flame</b> <b>hardening</b> is a very common surface hardening technique, which {{is often used}} to provide a very wear-resistant surface. A common use is for hardening the surface of gears, making the teeth more resistant to erosion. The gear will usually be quenched and tempered to a specific hardness first, making a majority of the gear tough, and then the teeth are quickly heated and immediately quenched, hardening only the surface. Afterward, {{it may or may not}} be tempered again to achieve the final differential hardness.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{versions}} of differential hardening were developed when sources of rapidly heating the metal were devised, {{such as an}} oxy-acetylene torch or induction heating. With <b>flame</b> <b>hardening</b> and induction hardening techniques, the steel is quickly heated to red-hot in a localized area and then quenched. This hardens {{only part of the}} object, but leaves the rest unaltered.|$|E
50|$|This {{process is}} often used for knife making, by heating only {{the edge of a}} {{previously}} quenched and tempered blade. When edge turns the proper color temperature, it is quenched, hardening only the edge, but leaving {{most of the rest of}} the blade at the lower hardness. The knife is then tempered again to produce the final differential hardness. However, unlike a blade that has been evenly heated and differentially quenched, <b>flame</b> <b>hardening</b> creates a heat-affected zone. Unlike the nioi, the boundary between the hot and cold metal formed by this heat-affected zone causes extremely rapid cooling when quenched. When combined with the stresses formed, this creates a very brittle zone between the hard and softer metal, which usually makes this method unsuitable for swords or tools that may be subjected to shear and impact stresses.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{is part of a larger}} project to investigate the wear and friction of the centre bearing of a rail freight truck. Existing centre bearing surfaces include <b>flame</b> <b>hardened</b> AISI 1030 steel and AISI 1053 cast steel top centres mating against un-greased and/or greased Hadfield steel centre bowl liners, and polyethylene centre bowl liners. The wear life of the unlubricated steels against Hadfield steel is short, greasing the bearings is costly, and industry reports some failures of polyethylene centre bowl liners due to excessive plastic flow and cracking of the rim wall. The present research investigates the materials characterisation of plasma nitrided AISI 4016 molybdenum alloy steel that could be used as an alternative centre bearing surface. The quench and tempered AISI 4016 steel samples were plasma nitrided at 450, 500, 550 and 580 °C using 75 % N 2 : 25 % H 2 mixture gas for 5 hours. The microstructures of the coatings were determined using optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The treated samples were characterised using x-ray diffraction and microhardness.

Iorniny test and ultrasonic erosion test were also conducted to evaluate the depth of surface hardening and the cavitation erosion resistance. The tests revealed that surface hardened by <b>flame</b> <b>hardening</b> is about 1. 5 times harder than the as-cast and the hardness is closely related to the area ratio of the hard /β + β' phase to a phase on the microstructure.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} investigate the influence of torch distance with cooling nozzle and the cooling water flow rate influence on the surface hardness of medium carbon steel in the <b>flame</b> <b>hardening</b> process. <b>Flame</b> <b>hardening</b> of metals {{is the process of}} hardening steel by heating the surface of the specimen which is then followed by a rapid cooling {{on the surface of the}} specimen. The heating process was done by using a gas flame from oksiasetilen, while cooling using water pumped from the container vessel. Variations of torch distance with cooling nozzle was 20 mm, 40 mm, 60 mm and flow rate water variation was 1200 cc/minute and 2400 cc/minute [...] Type of flame which used was carburation flame which regulated by using valve of oxygen and valve of asitelen. The results show that in this study showed that the hardening depth of specimen with 60 mm torch distance and cooler nozzle variation was deeper than 40 mm and 20 mm distance variation. On the variation of 60 / 1200, hardening depth reaches 3, 6 mm, 40 / 1200 reaches 2 mm, and 20 / 1200 reaches 0, 7 mm. From testing also showed that specimen with 2400 cc/minute water flow rate variation has higher surface hardness and the hardening depth was deeper than specimen with 1200 cc/minute water flow rate variation. The specimen of 20 / 2400 has 959, 46 HV surface hardness and the hardening depth reaches 2, 2 mm. The specimen of 20 / 1200 has 834, 27 HV surface hardness and the hardening depth reaches 0, 7 mm.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Flame</b> <b>hardening</b> {{has been}} {{traditionally}} used for selective surface hardening of steel. This technique frequently resulting in imprecise harden area and part distortion when overheated. Focused heating source such as plasma arc {{can be an}} alternative to overcome this problem. In this work, plasma arc is scanned at the 4340 steel surface to improve the hardness. The variable parameters investigated were at scanning speed and operating current. Four types of surfaces were observed after they are scanned with plasma arc. They are fully-melted, partially-melted, non-melted continuous and non-melted intermittent where each type of surface has different roughness value. This work found that scanning speed and operating current has significantly influence the type of surface and roughness values. Analysis on non-melted surface gives the maximum depth of hardened layer of about 187 µm as well as hardness values of about 990 HV 50. It is also observed that the depth of hardened layer and hardness value is significantly decreasing with increase in scanning speed or the decrease in operating current. Microstructure examination on hardened layer revealed that the increase of hardness is due to formation of fine grain martensitie structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{identify}} the need for Surface Hardening in Crankshafts and establishing Induction Hardening as the most practically viable process for the same. Crankshaft is one of the largest components in the internal combustion engine that has a complex geometry consisting of cylinders as bearings and plates as the crank webs. Geometry section changes in the crankshaft cause stress concentration at fillet areas where bearings are connected to the crank webs. In addition, this component experiences both torsional and bending load during its service life. The crankshaft must be capable of withstanding the intermittent variable loads impressed on it. The principal purpose of Surface Hardening is to increase the hardness, wear resistance and endurance limit of the surfaces of metal components. The core remains tough and can withstand impact loads. Prior to the advent of Induction Hardening methods such as furnace hardening, <b>flame</b> <b>hardening</b> and liquid nitriding were used. However each of these processes presented problems such as inadequate or non-uniform hardening and distortion. Induction Hardening overcomes many of these problems through rotation of the part during heat-treating and selection of frequency and power to obtain adequate case depth and uniform hardness...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, most of {{the tools}} of Volvo Cars Body Components (VCBC) in Olofström are {{hardened}} by <b>flame</b> <b>hardening</b> or induction hardening process. Indeed, VCBC has developed their own equipment for flame and induction hardening: However, Volvo has detected that 74 % of {{the total cost of}} one year maintenance was caused by trim dies and the main reason is actually trim edge problems which represent 26 % of year maintenance. This is why the R&D Forming &amp; Material department is investigating some ways to reduce those excessive costs caused by cutting tools. As a consequence, in this project, we will study the laser hardening of cutting tools. The aims of this project were to investigate: * The laser hardening process * The limits of different tool materials with this laser process This master thesis should give a beginning of answer to the following question: Is the laser hardening process a suitable alternative to induction hardening process for trim dies at VCBC ?

40|$|During {{operation}} of machinery {{or use of}} components, strength and toughness of materials are slowly degraded by load induced fatigue, creep or corrosion. Here, temperature {{is a very important}} parameter. Any degradation starts with changes of the microstructure of the materials and only grows slowly to cracklike defects, significant from the fracture mechanic point of view; but already changes of microstructure have influence on strength and toughness, especially of high strength steels. Therefore materials testing for quality assurance is needed not only during fabrication but also during operation. In safety related cases more and more the quality of the real components (not only small specimens) has to be tested nondestructively, and any testing for quality assurance during operation must be performed nondestructively. This contribution gives a survey on the R and D activities of the IzfP {{in the last few years}} dealing with evaluation of defects, structure of materials, residual and lo ad induced stresses which include grain size evaluation from ultrasonic backscatter, assessment of creep damage from ultrasonic velocity measurements, detection and imaging of fatigue damage by photoacoustic microscopy, ultrasonic measurement of macrostresses by polarized shear waves and application of micromagnetic multiparameter microstructure and stress analysis (3 MA) to the control of laser hardening, <b>flame</b> <b>hardening</b> of turbine blades and the detection of grinding defects.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis {{is concerned with the}} conception and design of a FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEM (FMS) for the automation of the manufacture of lawnmower cutting cylinders at Suffolk Lawnmowers Ltd. A review of FMS definitions, planning methods and current systems is carried out {{for the development of a}} suitable FMS configuration for the final stages of manufacture of grass cutting cylinders having 21 different design specifications. This involves examination of the capabilities of robotics and microcontrollers to automate the technologies used in cylinder production. The company's current manual batch production system is analysed to determine the suitable form and requirements of the FMS. This includes analyses of annual volumes, throughputs, batch sizes, product and process mixes. Long term objectives to automate the system are identified from which short term objectives are derived. The FMS recommended for immediate development encompasses the short term objectives for the welding, hardening, grinding and transfer processes of 8 cutting cylinder specifications. It is shown that the MIG (Argon/C 02) are welding, progressive <b>flame</b> <b>hardening</b> and wide-face cylindrical grinding processes can be developed successfully to automate cylinder production. The recommended system integrates these processes into an FMS through the'automatic handling of cylinders (through three process routes) by a robotic manipulator utilising a double gripper. 'A robotic welding station, manually loaded, is also recommended. ' The system is controlled overall by a 32 K microcontroller with the process machines individually controlled by programmahle logic controllers with up to 6 K of memory each. The economic appraisal of the FMS indicates a 4. 4 year payback based on direct labour and material cost savings. The company's application for grant aid to implement the FMS design has led to an offer of a Department of Industry grant to cover 50...|$|E
