According to the NAO, BBC {{executives}} approved £500,000 of additional funding for the 25th anniversary live episode (19 February 2010).

According to a Radio Times article for 212 episodes <b>it</b> <b>works</b> <b>out</b> at £141,000 per episode or 3.5p per viewer hour.|$|E

Our favourite soapy couple, Nancy and Darren, discover they’re going to be parents once again in tonight's episode, and we’ve got our fingers (and toes!) crossed that <b>it</b> <b>works</b> <b>out</b> for them this time". She said that [...] "with Darren's cheeky escapades and Nancy's no-messing attitude, they’ll make the perfect parents and we can’t wait to see them with a little one". Crick {{went on to say}} [...] "while Darren might be dad to twins already (remember them?

After all, a game that's story-driven lives and dies on the quality of said story." [...] He compared it to Her Story as something that could [...] "prove to be [...] very cool." [...] This sentiment was echoed by Kyle LeClair of Hardcore Gamer, writing that [...] "VA-11 Hall-A sure looks great and has quite a unique hook to it, so we'll be sure to try and wet our whistles with it when it comes out on the PC". Graham Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun claimed that although [...] "VA-11 Hall-A, whose punctuation I already resent having to type, is skirting with genres I don't care about: anime-styled visual novels", he found VA-11 HALL-As branching-style plotline to be more engaging that an average [...] "linear and relatively uninteractive" [...] visual novel. Rock, Paper, Shotgun also chose VA-11 HALL-A {{to be one of the}} best games shown at EGX Rezzed 2016.|$|E

This album represents what I've always wanted to do." [...] She said in another interview, [...] "I rap, I sing, I do my R, I do my slow songs and stuff that the girls will love, I have a down South joint, I have a rock song that I did with my girls–this band called Pretty Boys. [...] It has some funk, some old stuff, it's really fun." [...] She paid tribute to her Filipino culture by incorporating OPM sounds into some of the ballads. While describing the process of working with Leslie, she stated, [...] "I will talk about situations that I was going through at the time and we'll talk about that and it comes straight from the heart that's why <b>it</b> <b>works</b> <b>out</b> well between us," [...] continuing about her songwriting input, [...] "I was just kind of going along with it trying to get the vibe.

2500|$|Alexander Zubov of Kot-in-Action Creative Artel who {{developed}} the Steel Storm games complained in an interview about the trouble he had getting his games accepted into the Bundles, originally trying to push their game's first episode as a free bonus for the second Bundle, {{and then trying to}} get their full game into the third. Zubov recalls that he had heard [...] "nothing back" [...] until they made a [...] "last minute decision" [...] to include Steel Storm: Burning Retribution in the Humble Indie Bundle 3. Even then, Zubov further described his dissatisfaction with how payment was handled, saying that they were [...] "offered a tiny-tiny fraction of what HIB3 made, a very small (compared to the profits of HIB3) fixed amount of money" [...] even though, according to Zubov, [...] "when Steel Storm was released as a bonus, their sales jumped up significantly." [...] He also mentioned that despite claims by the organizers that their sales would [...] "sky rocket just because [...] were in the HIB3", their actual amount of sales remained relatively constant. Zubov noted that their inclusion in the third bundle [...] "did get a lot of users who redeemed their copy of Steel Storm on Steam and Desura" [...] and that they hoped this would help keep their [...] "current user base, which we gained with HIB3, interested in our upcoming games". He concluded his comments about his experiences by saying that [...] "only time will tell if HIB3 was [...] awesome deal or not. Maybe, maybe not. If <b>it</b> <b>works</b> <b>out</b> as a long term investment, it will be awesome indeed. If not, I will never ever participate in such capacity (as a bonus item for a small fixed payout) in the future HIB bundles. We all do have bills to pay and families to feed, don't we?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, Killer Love {{received}} a mixed to positive response from critics. Some praised Scherzinger's strong vocals and conviction to convey emotion, while others criticized {{her choice of}} allowing RedOne to produce {{the majority of the}} album, stating that some of the songs sounded too similar to each other. The Observers Michael Cragg noted the album as being consistent with most other modern R albums, stating [...] "Killer Love is two thirds deliriously catchy pop stompers and one third balladry." [...] Cragg also noted that Scherzinger's [...] "not so inconsiderable voice" [...] takes a backseat allowing the record producers to inject their own influences into her music. Alex Macpherson from BBC Online commented that [...] "Scherzinger {{is one of the few}} pop performers with the requisite power to dominate [...] beats rather than vice versa. Killer Love is far from the album you sense Scherzinger could still deliver: at times, her personality is all that – barely – carries substandard, unmemorable songs." [...] Kim Dawson from The Daily Star was positive, saying that [...] "Nicole's solo record truly is killer and no filler." [...] Another positive reaction came from [...] "Entertainment Focus" [...] who went to say that: [...] "Killer Love is a competent and enjoyable record from one of the nicest women in pop. Fingers crossed this time <b>it</b> <b>works</b> <b>out</b> for her." [...] The 4Music review was also positive, noting that [...] "Killer Love will definitely establish her as a viable act in her own right." [...] Robert Copsey wrote favorably for Digital Spy that [...] "Killer Love is a sturdy debut from the part-time X Factor judge that, in part, lives up to her promise of being [...] "in your face and strong".|$|E
