50|$|The <b>Joint</b> <b>parliamentary</b> <b>meeting</b> on the Future of Europe is {{a meeting}} of parliamentarians from the European Parliament and from the {{national}} parliaments of the member states of the European Union {{on the topic of}} the future of the European Union. The first of these meetings occurred on 2006-05-08/2006-05-09; the second occurred on 2006-12-04/2006-12-05. The third took place in Brussels on 11 and 12 June 2007.|$|E
50|$|In November 2010, Michel led a {{delegation}} of 50 MEPs on an eight-day trip to a ACP-EU <b>Joint</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> Assembly <b>meeting</b> in Kinshasa, whose total cost to the Parliament’s administrative budget was €1.03 million, an average cost per MEP of €20,511. It was the costliest parliamentary delegation trip outside the EU in 2010.|$|R
40|$|The ACP-EU <b>Joint</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> Assembly <b>meeting</b> in Brazzaville {{adopted a}} {{resolution}} on rice calling on: 'the EU Council {{to take full}} account of the adverse effects on the ACP rice industry when considering the European Commission's proposals for changes to the common organisation {{of the market in}} rice and to consider remedial and compensatory measures to alleviate the negative impact on ACP rice exporters' and to approve as a matter of urgency the financing proposal for the support package to enhance the competitiveness of the Caribbean rice industry'. It also called on the European Commission to implement the necessary adjustments to the management of the quota system for ACP rice so as to enhance its value to ACP rice exporters. These views were endorsed by ACP Ministers at their meeting in May 2003. Comment: With EU rice prices predicted to decline by 34 % {{in the first year of}} reform and by a total of 41 % by 2009, the importance of the EU recognising and addressing the external effects of rice-sector reform cannot be under-estimated. The importance of this issue is enhanced by the fact that similar problems will be faced in the sugar sector in the coming years. The concept which has emerged from the Southern African beef sector of introducing 'compensatory trade measures' in response to the implementation of CAP reform should also be explored for rice.

40|$|Europe’s {{association}} with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries {{was the first}} of its interregional relationships. In the nearly half century since the signature of the Treaty of Rome, it developed into Europe’s most institutionalized and multidimensional interregional relationship. It embraces not only trade and investment issues but also a development “partnership ” that includes what has traditionally been the EU’s largest single aid program, a <b>joint</b> <b>parliamentary</b> assembly, <b>meetings</b> of organizations representing civil society, and a dialogue on human rights. This chapter examines the factors that have shaped this relationship over the last four decades. The principal focus is on the trade regime, not just for consistency with the other contributions to this volume but also because it is in its trade dimension that the relationship has changed most dramatically over time...|$|R
40|$|The ACP-EU <b>Joint</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> Assembly <b>meeting</b> in Brazzaville {{adopted a}} {{resolution}} {{on the crisis}} in the international coffee market calling for, amongst other things, 'immediate action to assist small producers in Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya who have been severely affected by the crisis' and for the redeployment of former STABEX funds and additional funds to 'address the crisis faced by coffee-producing communities and take the necessary measures to enable the countries to benefit, without any conditions, from the 'B' envelope of the 9 th EDF'. It also called for 'major roaster companies to dedicate sufficient amounts of funds to address the plight of farmers and local communities' and to 'pay coffee growers a decent price'. Comment: For ACP countries the effects of the coffee crisis on coffee-dependent households and coffee-dependent communities have been particularly severe. The situation has been made worse by the discontinuation of the STABEX scheme, which earlier provided assistance with the immediate consequences of declining commodity earnings. During a similar crisis {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 s financial assistance totalling € 978 million was made available to ACP countries under the STABEX scheme to address the immediate problems arising from low coffee prices. No such assistance has been made available during the current coffee crisis. Indeed, efforts by East African countries to access 9 th EDF 'B' allocation resources made available in part to address losses in export earnings, have been singularly unsuccessful, suggesting that the new post-STABEX scheme is simply not up to the challenge of meeting the short-term needs of coffee-dependent ACP economies. There is a growing recognition amongst the Brussels ambassadors of East African coffee-dependent economies of the need for the EU to introduce an initiative to 'fast track' support to projects designed to address the needs of coffee-dependent households and coffee-dependent communities, using existing unutilised EDF resources and 9 th EDF 'B' allocations, with, if necessary, additional funds being made available from the general reserve of the 9 th EDF.

50|$|In addition, an MEP {{may be part}} of an {{international}} delegation and have meetings with outside delegations coming to Brussels or Strasbourg or visiting committees or parliaments of external countries or regions.
