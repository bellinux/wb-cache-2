5|$|In 1149 the Crusaders, who had conquered Gaza in 1100, built {{a cathedral}} {{dedicated}} to <b>John</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baptist</b> atop {{the ruins of}} the church upon a decree by Baldwin III of Jerusalem. However, in William of Tyre's descriptions of grand Crusader churches, it is not mentioned. Of the Great Mosque's three aisles today, it is believed that portions of two of them had formed part of the Cathedral of <b>John</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baptist.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{surviving}} frescoes on the church's interior walls date from the 18th century. These include images of the Mother of God, Jesus Christ and <b>John</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baptist,</b> all painted {{as part of the}} church's first reconstruction. However, restoration works carried out in the 2000s have uncovered 14th-century murals depicting the meeting of Elizabeth and Mary as well as <b>John</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baptist.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the title, St. <b>John</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baptist</b> Preaching did {{not have}} an {{obviously}} religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of <b>John</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baptist,</b> and carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.|$|E

5|$|After the council, Cuthbert {{continued}} {{to correspond with}} Boniface up until Boniface's martyrdom in 754, and then sent condolences to Boniface's successor. Cuthbert held a second synod in 758, but nothing is known of any enactments it made. He also built the church of St. <b>John</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baptist</b> in Canterbury, which was destroyed by fire in 1067. He was buried in his new church. The new church was located {{on the west side}} of the cathedral, and was used as a baptistery. The church also became a burial site for many of the archbishops, and later was used for trials by ordeal. There is no explicit contemporary reference that states that these uses were intended by Cuthbert, but the fact that the church was dedicated to St. <b>John</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baptist</b> argues strongly that Cuthbert at least intended the new building as a baptistery.|$|E
