5|$|Aqil's {{closeness}} {{with the}} Europeans disturbed the Ottomans. His {{relations with the}} kaimakam of Acre, who in 1863 was Hasan Effendi, were also deteriorating. Since his return to Palestine in 1854, he avoided setting <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, instead assigning a resident representative who engaged the kaimakam on his behalf. Hasan Effendi lodged complaints to the provincial governor in Beirut, Kapuli Pasha, about the misconduct of Aqil's men who extorted the local peasantry. Indeed, Aqil's protection was generally limited to those who could pay for his services or otherwise benefit his interests, including merchants, travelers, monks, pilgrims, Christians and Jews.|$|E
5|$|Considered the top {{high school}} player in the country, Bradley {{initially}} chose to attend Duke University {{in the fall of}} 1961. However, after breaking his <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1961 during a baseball game and thinking about his college decision outside of basketball, Bradley decided to enroll at Princeton due to its record in preparing students for government or United States Foreign Service work. He had been awarded a scholarship at Duke, but not at Princeton; the Ivy League does not allow its members to award athletic scholarships, and Bradley's family's wealth disqualified him from receiving financial aid.|$|E

He was named the starting quarterback on the school's football team his senior year, but he broke his <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second game of the season.

Currently, Hacker lives in Corsicana, Texas, with his wife, Christine, whom he married in November 2008. He is a Dallas Cowboys fan. Two of his hobbies are fishing and pool.|$|E

5|$|Norwegian Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen was {{the first}} person known to have set <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{territory}}, in 1930. On 14 January 1939, the territory was claimed by Norway. From 1939 until 1945, Nazi Germany claimed New Swabia, which consisted of part of Queen Maud Land. On 23 June 1961, Queen Maud Land became part of the Antarctic Treaty System, making it a demilitarised zone. It is one of two Antarctic claims made by Norway, the other being Peter I Island. They are administrated by the Polar Affairs Department of the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security in Oslo.|$|E

5|$|On 22 April 2012, Chen {{escaped from}} house arrest. Chen's fellow activist Hu Jia stated that Chen had been {{planning}} escape for a long time, and had previously attempted to dig a tunnel for escape. In {{the weeks leading up}} to his escape, Chen gave his guards the impression that he was ill in bed, and stopped appearing outside the house, which allowed him several days before any absence would be discovered. Under cover of darkness and with the help of his wife, Chen climbed over the wall around his house, breaking his <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of hostilities in April 1775, the 64th was still stationed at Castle William and remained there as the garrison throughout the Siege of Boston. Consequently, the regiment did not {{take part in the}} Battle of Bunker Hill. When, in March 1776, the British abandoned Boston, the 64th were the last regiment to depart for Halifax, giving them the distinction of being the last British unit to set <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth of Massachusetts during the war.|$|E
5|$|One <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave was a British BBC {{television}} dark comedy sitcom series {{written by}} David Renwick.

The episode's transmission was immediately preceded by I Don't Believe It!

The documentary was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the North Caucasus Military District commander {{and the air force}} and their roles in commanding were unclear. Colonel-General Aleksandr Zelin, commander-in-chief of the Air Force did not set <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> command post, instead running Air-force operations on a mobile phone from his office without any help from his air-defence assistants. The air force was accused of rendering no assistance to land campaign.|$|E
5|$|The rhyme is {{constructed}} of quatrains in trochaic tetrameter catalectic, (each line {{made up of}} four metrical feet of two syllables, with the stress falling on the first syllable in a pair; the last <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line missing the unstressed syllable), which is common in nursery rhymes. In its most common form it relies on a double repetition, rather than a rhyming scheme, which is a frequently employed device in children's rhymes and stories. The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 502.|$|E

Heydrich ran after him for half a block but became weak from shock and collapsed. He sent his driver, Klein, to chase Gabčík on <b>foot.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> ensuing firefight, Gabčík shot Klein in the leg and escaped to a local safe house.

5|$|A meeting {{among the}} party leaders, {{including}} Whitlam and Fraser, {{to resolve the}} crisis {{on the morning of}} 11 November came to nothing. Kerr and Whitlam met at the Governor-General's office that afternoon at 1.00pm. Unknown to Whitlam, Fraser was waiting in an ante-room; Whitlam later stated that he would not have set <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building if he had known Fraser was there. Whitlam, as he had told Kerr by phone earlier that day, came prepared to advise a half-Senate election, to be held on 13December. Kerr instead told Whitlam that he had terminated his commission as prime minister, and handed him a letter to that effect. After the conversation, Whitlam returned to the Prime Minister's residence, The Lodge, had lunch and conferred with his advisers. Immediately after his meeting with Whitlam, Kerr commissioned Fraser as 'caretaker' Prime Minister, on the assurance he could obtain supply and would then advise Kerr to dissolve both houses for election.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day on July 20, Dean {{ordered the}} {{headquarters}} of the 34th Infantry to withdraw. Dean remained behind and assisted the US troops in evacuating the city until the last convoy was ready to leave Taejon. As the last convoy of troops moved out of the city and fought through a North Korean roadblock, Dean, with a small force of soldiers, followed them. At the edge of the city, the final elements of the 34th Infantry, leaving the city in 50 vehicles, were ambushed and many of their vehicles were destroyed by machine guns and mortars, forcing the Americans to retreat on <b>foot.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> ensuing fight, Dean's jeep made a wrong turn and was separated from the rest of the American forces.|$|E

5|$|Davies and Caldwell {{began the}} 2012–13 season as first choice until an ankle injury {{sustained}} by Davies during a League Cup match at Coventry City gave Pablo an early opportunity to impress. He kept his place after Davies returned to fitness, but chipped a {{bone in his}} <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> defeat to Barnsley and {{was expected to be}} out for a month. Further injuries, the return to fitness of Caldwell, and the emergence of young left-back Mitch Hancox, which allowed Paul Robinson to partner Davies in the centre, meant that Pablo played only twice more, and he was released {{at the end of his}} contract.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's {{second season}} {{was cut short}} when he broke his <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games. Despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record (at {{the time it was}} fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history), the Bulls made the playoffs. Jordan {{recovered}} in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return. Against a 1985–86 Boston Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history, Jordan set the still-unbroken record for points in a playoff game with 63 in Game 2. The Celtics, however, managed to sweep the series.|$|E
5|$|The five {{previous}} {{series of}} One <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave were produced {{and directed by}} Susan Belbin. She had retired because of ill health. Renwick persuaded her {{to return to work}} on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again. The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as on other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.|$|E
