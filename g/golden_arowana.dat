50|$|Crossback Arowana Farm at Bukit Merah Perak is Ahmad's latest {{business}} venture. He is a {{major shareholder}} for this <b>golden</b> <b>arowana</b> breeding farm {{and most of his}} pricey arowanas are exported to Mainland China.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} {{resemblance}} to the Asian Arowanas they are sometimes sold {{in the name of}} <b>golden</b> <b>Arowana</b> in some of the Asian countries, like India. However, they can be easily distinguished from the Asian Arowanas by identifying their red spotted fins & 7-8 rows of scales on their body.|$|E
25|$|Mature gold crossback arowanas are {{distinguished}} from the red-tailed <b>golden</b> <b>arowanas</b> by having metallic gold crossing the back completely. This variety also lacks the reddish fins of the red-tailed golden.|$|R
25|$|Mature red-tailed <b>golden</b> <b>arowanas</b> have {{brilliant}} metallic gold lateral scales, gill covers, bellies, and pectoral and {{pelvic fin}} membranes, although the back is dark. In juveniles, the areas destined to develop golden colour start out metallic silver. The anal fin {{and the bottom}} portion of the caudal fin are light brown to dark red.|$|R
40|$|Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is {{a highly}} {{endangered}} fish species listed in Appendix 1 of CITES since 1980. In order to explore the population genetic structure of <b>golden</b> Asian <b>arowanas</b> Scleropages formosus from the breeding population, of 26 fish sampled were genotyped at twenty microsatellite loci. The average allele number of 14 polymorphic microsatellites was 2. 94 loci. The average observed heterozygosity was 0. 446 ranging from 0. 143 to 1. 00, and the gene diversity was quite high (0. 78). All {{these data suggest that}} middle level of genetic diversity existed in the <b>golden</b> Asian <b>arowana</b> population. Data showed the population somewhat departed from HWE, such as excessive and deficient heterozygote numbers. AMOVA analysis offered evidence of a weak genetic differentiation with 0. 51 % variation between samples...|$|R
50|$|Around 1000 {{fish species}} {{are known to}} live in the rivers, lakes, and swamps of Sundaland. Borneo has about 430 species, with 164 of them {{considered}} endemic. Sumatra has 270 species, 42 of which are endemic. The <b>golden</b> <b>arowana</b> (Scleropages formosus) originates from this region. Around 200 new species of fish have been identified in the last ten years.|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial DNA {{cytochrome}} b (cytb) gene complete {{sequences of}} <b>golden</b> <b>arowana,</b> red arowana and green arowana of Scleropages formosus were amplified with PCR technique and sequenced. The sequence length was 1141 bp for three Asian arowanas which had 5 nucleotide sites substituted, among of them 4 base substitutions were transition and only 1 was transversion, {{all of the}} base substitution happened in the third locus of the codon which only 1 site caused amino acid variation. A global deficit of guanosines (G: 13. 7 %) and approximately equal frequencies {{of the other three}} nucleotides (A: 27. 8 %, C: 34. 6 %, T: 23. 9 %) and G+C content (48. 3 %) was quite constant among sequences. The genetic distance of mtDNA cytb gene sequences was 0. 0026 - 0. 0035 between green arowana and the other two Asian arowana, which indicated that Asian arowana perhaps did not evolve to the level of specie. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with NJ method and MP method using arithmetic average method. The results showed that red arowana clustered with <b>golden</b> <b>arowana,</b> after clustering with green arowana...|$|E
30|$|Among the {{different}} colours of Asiatic arowana, red and <b>golden</b> <b>arowana</b> fishes {{are the most}} expensive and popular ornamental pets in the hatchery industry compared to black, green, silver, and others colour varieties [1, 5, 10, 13]. The egg thievery phenomenon of Asiatic arowana is atypical compared to other fish species. In general, arowana fishes get mature {{at the age of}} 3 – 4  years, and they lay only a few eggs (30 – 100) [14, 15] of extra-large size (around 1  cm in diameter) [16]. Interestingly, the fertilised eggs and larvae are then protected and grown up in the mouth of male arowana fishes, and they show high parental care. To identify the gender based on visual observation of the baby arowana is difficult because there is no distinctive phenotypic organ of sexual dimorphism [14, 15]. Only one of the parents (presume to be the male) can be identified as the offspring are harvested from his mouth. The other parent cannot be identified from among a number of potential parents [16].|$|E
40|$|The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus), {{one of the}} world’s most {{expensive}} cultivated ornamental fishes, is an endangered species. It represents an ancient lineage of teleosts: the Osteoglossomorpha. Here, we provide a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome of a female golden-variety arowana {{using a combination of}} deep shotgun sequencing and high-resolution linkage mapping. In addition, we have also generated two draft genome assemblies for the red and green varieties. Phylogenomic analysis supports a sister group relationship between Osteoglossomorpha (bonytongues) and Elopomorpha (eels and relatives), with the two clades together forming a sister group of Clupeocephala which includes all the remaining teleosts. The arowana genome retains the full complement of eight Hox clusters unlike the African butterfly fish (Pantodon buchholzi), another bonytongue fish, which possess only five Hox clusters. Differential gene expression among three varieties provides insights into the genetic basis of colour variation. A potential heterogametic sex chromosome is identified in the female arowana karyotype, suggesting that the sex is determined by a ZW/ZZ sex chromosomal system. The high-quality reference genome of the <b>golden</b> <b>arowana</b> and the draft assemblies of the red and green varieties are valuable resources for understanding the biology, adaptation and behaviour of Asian arowanas...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{variability}} of wild populations of green arowana (Scleropages formosus) from Tasek Bera Lake and Endau River and a captive stock of Malaysian <b>golden</b> <b>arowana</b> as an out-group population was studied. The {{average number of}} alleles per locus was low, ranging from 2. 33 in the Endau River population to 2. 56 in the Tasek Bera Lake population. Departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed in these three populations depending on the locus. Among nine loci, seven significantly deviated from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (p< 0. 05) in the Tasek Bera Lake population whereas five significantly departed from HWE (p< 0. 05) in the Endau River population. A deficit of heterozygosity was observed from the analysis of these nine loci. This genetic data indicate the wild population may be under stress due to inbreeding, over fishing and deterioration in the breeding environment. The estimates of F ST and R ST were statistically greater than zero for each comparison and this suggested the existence of three genetically distinct populations. However, the values of F ST is low between Tasek Bera Lake and Endau River populations, reflecting historical patterns of connections between river systems in Peninsular Malaysia...|$|E
