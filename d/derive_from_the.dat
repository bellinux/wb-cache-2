5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
5|$|The Old Norse {{feminine}} proper noun Hel {{is identical}} to the name of the location over which she rules, Old Norse Hel. The word has cognates in all branches of the Germanic languages, including Old English hell (and thus Modern English hell), Old Frisian helle, Old Saxon hellia, Old High German hella, and Gothic halja. All forms ultimately <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reconstructed Proto-Germanic feminine noun *xaljō or *haljō ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the o-grade form of the Proto-Indo-European root *kel-, *kol-: 'to cover, conceal, save'.|$|E
5|$|The {{cross is}} thought to date from the tenth century, and {{exhibits}} distinctive Hiberno-Scottish mission influences, in common with several other monuments in the area. Tradition and folk etymology suggest that the cross marked the burial site of Camus, leader of the Norse army purportedly defeated by King Malcolm II at the apocryphal Battle of Barry. The name of the stone is likely to <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> extinct village of Camuston, which has a Celtic toponymy.|$|E

5|$|The name of {{the cross}} is likely to <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> village of Camuston.

Its former location is indicated in the 1794 map by Ainslie, about half a mile to the east of the cross. Camuston can be found with earlier spelling variations, for example, 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425 and 1426, and has a Celtic rather than Scandinavian etymology.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} epithet, tigris, {{as well as}} {{the common}} name, tiger, come from the Middle English tigre and the Old English tigras (a plural word), both used for the animal. These <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old French tigre, itself a derivative of the Latin word tigris and the Greek word tigris. The original source may have been the Persian tigra meaning pointed or sharp and the Avestan tigrhi meaning an arrow, perhaps referring to the speed with which a tiger launches itself at its prey. It is worth mentioning that Mesopotamia, where the Caspian tiger had occurred, has a river called 'Tigris'.|$|E
5|$|The term 'clock' {{encompasses}} {{a wide spectrum}} of devices, ranging from wristwatches to the Clock of the Long Now.

Indeed, bells were used to mark the passage of time; they marked the passage of the hours at sea and in abbeys.|$|E

5|$|Advaita {{literally}} means non-duality, {{and it is}} a monistic {{system of}} thought. It deals with the non-dual nature of Brahman and Atman. Advaita is considered the most influential sub-school of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. Gaudapada {{was the first person to}} expound the basic principles of the Advaita philosophy in a commentary on the conflicting statements of the Upanishads. Gaudapada's Advaita ideas were further developed by Shankara (8th century CE). King states that Gaudapada's main work, Māṇḍukya Kārikā, is infused with philosophical terminology of Buddhism, and uses Buddhist arguments and analogies. King also suggests that there are clear differences between Shankara's writings and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara are at odds with those in the Upanishads. Radhakrishnan, on the other hand, suggests that Shankara's views of Advaita were straightforward developments of the Upanishads and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Upanishads.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{initiation}} proper, Lucius must undergo {{a series of}} ritual purifications. The priest bathes him, asks the gods for forgiveness on his behalf, and sprinkles him with water. This confession of and repentance for past sins fits {{with an emphasis on}} chastity and other forms of self-denial found in many other sources about the Isis cult. Lucius next has to wait ten days, while abstaining from meat and wine, before {{the initiation}} begins. Purifying baths were common in many rituals across the Greco-Roman world. The plea for forgiveness, however, may <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> oaths that Egyptian priests were required to take, in which they declared themselves to be free of wrongdoing. The sprinkling with water and the refraining from certain foods probably come from the purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple. On the evening of the final day, Lucius receives a variety of gifts from fellow devotees of Isis before donning a clean linen robe and entering the deepest part of the temple.|$|E
5000|$|The {{masculine}} Ronald is <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old Norse Rögnvaldr, {{which is}} composed of the elements regin ("advice", [...] "decision") and valdr ("ruler").
