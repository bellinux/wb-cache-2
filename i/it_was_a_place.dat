5|$|At Banagher, {{there are}} ridges {{on both sides}} of the river and roads were built along these many centuries ago. The first bridge was built over the Shannon at that point as early as 1049. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of great {{strategic}} importance because the Shannon and its lowlands provided a natural barrier between Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.|$|E

25|$|The Crusaders {{occupied}} {{the city in}} 1099 and named it St. Jorge de Lidde. It was briefly conquered by Saladin, but retaken by the Crusaders in 1191. The Crusaders built a cathedral, currently changed to become the Great Mosque of Ramla—one of Israel's best-preserved Crusader churches. For the English Crusaders, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of great significance as the birthplace of Saint George. The Crusaders made it the seat of a Latin rite diocese, and it remains a titular see. It owed the service of 10 knights and 20 sergeants, and it had its own burgess court during this era.|$|E

25|$|Near Paw Paw, the {{engineers}} had no good solutions.

So they took the more expensive decision to build a tunnel through the mountain. The initial cost estimate of $33,500 proved far too low. The tunnel was completed for $616,478.65 Among the components of the project, a kiln was built to provide bricks to line the tunnel.|$|E
25|$|From the makams of {{the royal}} courts to the melodies {{of the royal}} harems, a type of dance music emerged that was {{different}} from the oyun havası of fasıl music. In the Ottoman Empire, the harem was that part of a house set apart for the women of the family. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> in which non-family males were not allowed. Eunuchs guarded the sultan's harems, which were quite large, including several hundred women who were wives and concubines. There, female dancers and musicians entertained the women living in the harem. Belly dance was performed by women for women. This female dancer, known as a rakkase, hardly ever appeared in public.|$|E
25|$|After Freetown, Sierra Leone, {{was founded}} in the late 18th century by the British as a colony for poor blacks from London and black Loyalists from Nova Scotia, resettled after the American Revolutionary War, they did not allow slaves to be taken from Sierra Leone. They tried {{to protect the people}} from kidnappers. In 1808 both Great Britain and the United States {{prohibited}} the African slave trade. After that date, the British, whose navy patrolled to intercept slave ships off Africa, sometimes resettled Africans liberated from slave trader ships in Sierra Leone. Similarly, Americans sometimes settled freed slaves at Liberia, a similar colony established in the early 19th century by the American Colonization Society. As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> for freed slaves and free blacks from the United States, some free blacks emigrated there voluntarily, for the chance to create their own society.|$|E

25|$|The {{area between}} University Avenue and Spadina Avenue on Queen Street West {{was home to}} the punks since the mid seventies. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of old garment & textile {{industry}} buildings that time had forgotten in the seventies. Punk got its foothold in venues such as the Horseshoe Tavern, Beverley Hotel, X-Rays & the Black Bull patio (pre-bikers) & changed the area into a bohemian, artistic community (pre-current corporate gentrification). As early goth was evolving out of the punk scene these new goths found a kindred spirit & sense of community in Queen Street West as well. However, rent increases & the economic down turn of the early 90's drove many shops, designers & residents to move to adjacent neighbourhoods, most notably West Queen West, which is west of Bathurst Street on Queen Street West. Kensington Market also attracted underground or alternative lifestyle individuals, including those who later became the goths.|$|E
25|$|An almost {{inaccessible}} cave, dubbed Yoram Cave, {{located on}} the sheer southern cliff face 100 m below the plateau, {{has been found to}} contain numerous plant remains, of which 6,000-year-old barley seeds were in such good state of preservation that their genome could be sequenced. This {{is the first time that}} this succeeded with a Chalcolithic plant genome, which is also the oldest one sequenced so far. The result helped determine that the earliest domestication of barley, dated elsewhere in the Fertile Crescent to 10,000 years ago, happened further north up the Jordan Rift Valley, namely in the Upper Jordan Valley in northern Israel. The Yoram Cave seeds were found to be fairly different from the wild variety, proof for an already advanced process of domestication, but very similar to the types of barley still cultivated in the region - an indication for remarkable constancy. Considering the difficulty in reaching the cave, whose mouth opens some 4 m above the exposed access path, the researchers have speculated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of short-term refuge for Chalcolithic people fleeing an unknown catastrophe.|$|E

The Phoenicians colonized Malta in around the 8th century BC, and they founded the city of Maleth on this plateau. It was taken over by the Roman Republic in 218 BC, becoming known as Melite.

500|$|With {{its history}} of colonialism, trade and piracy, the West Indies was {{the setting for}} many 17th and 18th-century {{maritime}} incidents. [...] The privateer-turned-pirate Henry Jennings and his followers decided, early in the 18th century, to use the uninhabited island of New Providence {{as a base for}} their operations; it was within easy reach of the Florida Strait and its busy shipping lanes, which were filled with European vessels crossing the Atlantic. [...] New Providence's harbour could easily accommodate hundreds of ships, and was too shallow for the Royal Navy's larger vessels to navigate. [...] The author George Woodbury described New Providence as [...] "no city of homes; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of temporary sojourn and refreshment for a literally floating population," [...] continuing, [...] "The only permanent residents were the piratical camp followers, the traders, and the hangers-on; all others were transient."

Williams gave the new nightclub the name of the Manhattan neighborhood because [...] "a lot of black people live there". The district, known as [...] "Kentucky Avenue and the Curb", had become the home for African-Americans in the racially-segregated city since the end of World War I. The new nightspot joined other popular black entertainment venues in the district such as Grace's Little Belmont, the Wintergarten, and the Paradise Club. Along with Harlem's [...] "Cotton Club", <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> for the moneyed set to enjoy an evening of African-American entertainment.

500|$|The {{origin of}} the name, Wolf Point, is unknown. In her 1856 memoir Wau-Bun, Juliette Kinzie states that 'the place was then called Wolf Point, from its having been the {{residence}} of an Indian named [...] "Moa-way," [...] or [...] "the Wolf."' Other alternate explanations are that it was so-named after the landlord of what would later be called the Wolf Point Tavern killed a ferocious wolf and hung a painted sign of a wolf outside his tavern to commemorate the event, or that it was named by a soldier at Fort Dearborn because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where wolves would gather at night. Originally the term Wolf Point referred {{to the west bank}} of the Chicago River at the fork junction of its branches, but it gradually came to refer to the whole region around the forks and in modern usage is often more specifically used to mean the plot of land on the north side of the forks. The confluence of the three branches of the river near Wolf Point provided inspiration for Chicago's Municipal Device, a Y-shaped, city identification symbol that can be seen on many buildings in Chicago, and on city owned vehicles.|$|E
500|$|In October 1954, {{flooding}} {{caused by}} Hurricane Hazel caused {{the destruction of}} bridges and buildings in the valley. As {{a consequence of the}} destruction on the Don and other rivers, the provincial government of Ontario banned development on river floodplains. In 1957, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA) was formed, merging all conservation authorities responsible for Toronto watersheds (including the DVCA), with greater powers to manage valley lands. The MTRCA began expropriating privately owned land in the valley for flood control, often creating or conserving open space uses. Sauriol, who was by then an employee of the MTRCA, {{was one of the few}} to speak out against the parkway project. Sauriol's cottage at the Forks of the Don would be expropriated by Metro Toronto for the parkway, although much of his land is now part of the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve, which extends from the Forks of the Don, along the East Don to Milne Hollow at Lawrence Avenue, visible from the parkway. By contrast, Metro chairman Gardiner had an opposite opinion of the Don Valley and was quoted [...] "I'll tell you what the Don Valley was. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to murder little boys, that's what it was." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Thierry Bianquis, [...] "Hardly anything definite {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} town [...] before the Muslim era." [...] Medieval Talmudic and Syriac writers (such as Michael the Syrian and Bar Hebraeus) identified it with the Biblical town of Rehobot han-Nahar ("Rehobot by the river [...] "). Some medieval Muslim historians, among them al-Tabari, have written that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> called [...] "Furda" [...] or [...] "Furdat Nu'm", named after a monastery that supposedly existed in its vicinity called [...] "Dayr Nu'm". However, the 9th-century Persian historian al-Baladhuri asserts that there was [...] "no trace that ar-Rahba... was an old city", and that it was first founded by the Abbasid general Malik ibn Tawk during the reign of Caliph al-Ma'mun (813–833 CE). As such, the fortress town was often referred to as [...] "Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk" [...] by Muslim historians. According to Syrian historian Suhayl Zakkar, al-Rahba held significant strategic value as it was [...] "the key to Syria and sometimes to Iraq" [...] and it was the first stop for Syria-bound caravans coming from Iraq. From al-Rahba, travelers, caravans and armies could proceed northwestward along the Euphrates route to Aleppo or traverse the desert route to Damascus. Because of its strategic value, it was frequently fought over by rival Muslim powers. Bedouin tribes in particular used al-Rahba as a main launch point for invasions of northern Syria, and as a safe haven and marketplace. Malik ibn Tawk served as its first lord, and after his death in 873, he was succeeded by his son Ahmad. The latter was expelled following al-Rahba's capture in 883 by the Abbasid lord of al-Anbar, Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Saj. By the 10th century, al-Rahba had become a large town.|$|E
