50|$|The {{method is}} heavily used in central, {{southern}} parts of Africa (i.e. Botswana) and South America. Small scale farmers {{have found the}} process to be more beneficial in their regions. Botswana is an arid area, it can go {{for longer periods of}} time without rain and therefore hermetic storage has helped in times without rain i.e. draught. Seeds are well stored for the next season of plowing even though at times seeds are purchase. Usually seeds purchase is done in supplementary measures. In Botswana, traditional people usually use the hermetic storage placed inside a <b>jute</b> <b>bag</b> to increase efficiency and effectiveness in eradicating living organisms within few days. Also, hermetic is crucial in Africa as most of the seeds are produced and stored in the farm. Experimental results proved that hermetic storage of seeds for twelve months can retain germination and viability characteristics, whilst extremely harsh conditions can render an opposite effect.Brazilian grain producers are starting to use hermetic bags on site to store grains as an alternative to bins. They claim that the cost is accessible and the quality of the grain remains the same for a period of 18 months. The bags are made of polyethylene that are capable of reflect sunlight and avoid the heating of the product as well as degradation by light.Argentina has to, frequently, deal with a storage shortage of 20 to 35 million tonnes of grain. This led to quality and quantity loss since the grain has to be transported directly from the farms to elevators, and from elevators to terminal ports. Hermetically sealed plastic bags (silo bags) has gained popularity among producers to overcome this issue. In 2008 harvest season, more than 33 million tonnes of grain were stored using the silo bags in the country for several grains and oilseeds, and, now, this technology is being adopted by other South American countries.Sealed bag has been used to store mostly silage in North America, however, the use of this storage system started to grown since the early 2000s. Still, instead using hermetic choices, the most common option when dealing with storage shortage is piling the grain on the ground.|$|E

The initial moisture content (m. c.) of milled rice was ± 14 %. Three replications (3 bags) were used for each treatment. Each bag was put individually and was arranged randomly on a wooden pallet. The results showed that in general, the increase of milling degree and duration of storage decreased the m. c. Type of bag did not give significant differences on the m. c. Twenty eight fungal species were isolated from rice with different milling degree and bag type during storage. The predominant species was Aspergillus Candidas. Total fungal population decreased {{with the increase of}} milling degree and duration of storage. Bag type did not give significant differences on total fungal population. In general, the increase of milling degree increased glucose content. Glucose content in milled rice packed in <b>jute</b> <b>bag</b> was higher than that in polypropylene bag. Glucose content tended to decrease with the increase of storage duration. The increase of milling degree increased amylose content in milled rice. Amylose content of milled rice packed in <b>jute</b> <b>bag</b> was lower than that in polypropylene bag. The increase of storage duration decreased amylose content in milled rice. In general, protein content decreased with the increase of milling degree and duration of storage. 1 type did not give significant differences on protein content.

The coffee beans were stored in adverse conditions of relative humidity of 80 % and alternating temperature (30 oC to 25 oC for 16 hours and 8 hours) for 150 days. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial triple + 2 (two packs, two runs and two controls to each processing) with three replications. The study was conducted at the Department of Rural Engineering, Universidade Estadual Paulista, School of Agronomic Sciences, Botucatu. To assess the quality sensory analyzes, water content, fat acidity, electrical conductivity, color assessment, total sugars, density and polyphenol oxidase enzyme activity were made. After data acquisition, they were subjected to analysis of variance and means were compared by Tukey test at 5 % probability. It can be concluded that the silo-bag in modified atmosphere, after five months of storage, managed to avoid rewetting of grain and possible minor loss of quality of the beverage in relation to <b>jute</b> <b>bag</b> for both the parchment coffee as for coffee coconut, but favored the bleaching process of the grains in all storage environments.

A PICS bag is a three-layered hermetic bag-system that forms a barrier against the influx of oxygen and the escape of carbon dioxide. Jute, woven polypropylene or PICS bags were filled with shelled maize grain, purchased from the participating farmers, and the three sets of bags kept in the farmers’ own stores for 35 weeks. Oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the PICS bags were monitored, {{as well as the}} temperature and relative humidity in all the bags. Grain moisture, live insect population, grain damage and weight loss were examined at intervals of seven weeks. Oxygen and carbon dioxide composition demonstrated that PICS bags are capable of sustaining good air-barrier properties under farmer storage conditions.

40|$|Pearl millet is the {{principal}} staple food crop in large portions of Western Sub-Sahelian Africa and the millet head miner (Heliocheilus albipunctella) {{is one of its}} most devastating insect pests. Since 2006, augmentative mass releases of the larval ectoparasitoid, Habrobracon hebetor, have been conducted in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger as part of minimizing pearl millet grain losses imposed by millet head miners. These ongoing mass releases are based on low-cost mass-rearing of both host larvae and parasitoids. A release of parasitoids consists of placing jute bags containing pearl millet grain and flour and parasitized host larvae near pearl millet fields. The total production costs of a single <b>jute</b> <b>bag</b> with parasitized rice moth larvae are US$ 3 - 4. Based on a study of 6634 individual pearl millet heads collected at harvest in 12 farmers' fields in southern Niger in 2010, we demonstrated (i) a strong negative correlation between pearl millet head damage (mining) and grain yield and (ii) that parasitism by H. hebetor reduced grain losses by, on average, 34 % (comparison of infested millet heads with/without parasitism) within the given growing season. Additional benefits may include reduction in millet head miners in subsequent generations. Data from 900 pearl millet heads collected in nine farmers' fields in 2011 were used to confirm data trends observed in the 2010 data and to characterize the dispersal of parasitoids in upwind and downwind directions from a release site. This study provided a quantitative description of the negative impact of millet head miner infestations on pearl millet grain yields and of benefits on grain yield of parasitism by H. hebetor. Our findings strongly support (i) intensification of mass-rearing of H. hebetor, (ii) expansion of educational activities to increase local empowerment and understanding of the potential of augmentative biological control and (iii) optimization of H. hebetor mass release programmes among smallholders in Sub-Sahelian Africa. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH...|$|E

Groundnut production is usually hampered by several biotic and abiotic constraints during pre-harvest which to a greater extent are tackled by integrated management approaches while in the post-harvest, storage is a big challenge especially for farmers as groundnut bruchid, Caryedon serratus (Olivier) causes severe damage to groundnut pods when stored in improper storage conditions. In view of the importance of groundnut bruchid during storage, laboratory studies on “Evaluation of improved grain storage practices for the management of Groundnut Bruchid, Caryedon serratus Olivier. (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) ” were conducted at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, Hyderabad. Studies were contemplated on estimation of oxygen requirement to bruchid, performance of triple layer bag as a tool of hermetic storage technology to manage bruchid, Aspergillus flavus growth and aflatoxin contamination in groundnut pods stored at 10 and 14 per cent moisture regimes and effect of C. serratus and A. flavus on changes in important biochemical constituents viz., oil, protein and fatty acid composition of groundnut kernels under different storage conditions. The mode of action of hermetic storage on groundnut bruchid was investigated to determine the actual requirement of oxygen by the bruchid and to understand the dynamics of change in oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations and its effects on insects. The results revealed that a single bruchid from egg to pupal stage used approximately 39. 97 ml of oxygen and simultaneously produced 26. 21 ml of carbon dioxide. It is observed that any reduction in level of oxygen availability (hypoxia) than the requirement and increase in level of carbon dioxide concentration (hypercarbia) than optimum level, in storage conditions caused cessation of feeding and eventually death of insects. The performance of triple layer plastic bag as source of hermetic storage technology was evaluated for managing groundnut bruchid, C. serratus and storage fungi, A. flavus by storing groundnut pods with 10 and 14 per cent moisture contents and observing the development of bruchid and fungus at 2, 4 and 6 months of storage. The results revealed that groundnut pod with varying moisture contents stored in triple layer bag for a period of six months recorded 100 per cent mortality of bruchids and retained seed integrity significantly better than the pods stored in traditional bags such as jute, polythene and <b>jute</b> <b>bag</b> treated with insecticide.
