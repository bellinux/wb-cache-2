40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effect of rearing method on the fatty acid composition of broiler meat. The subjects were chickens of two genotypes (Ross 208 and Prelux-bro). Experiment went on for 56 days, chickens were kept in a standard <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> <b>house</b> and fed the same diet. After 28 days chickens {{were divided into two}} groups of 50 birds, the first grup had a 12 -hours daily access to a grassy surface (free range), the second remaining indoors. At the end of experiment, 8 broilers per group (total of 32) were randomly chosen for fatty acid composition analysis. After slaughter, breasts and legs with skin were excised, homogenised and freeze-stored. Analyses of fatty acid composition was preformed by gas-liquid chromatography (in situ transesterification). The results were processed with statistical computer program SAS. From the perspective of human nutrition, free range broilers gave meat with better fatty acid composition (increased content of ω- 3 and ω- 6 fatty acids) compared to indoor raised chickens. Fatty acid composition was more favourable for breast then leg, and for Prelux-bro than Ross 20...|$|E

40|$|Q fever is {{distributed}} {{in a number}} of ways, one of which is through inhalation of particles of manure from infected animals kept in deep litter houses. In the lambing season farms with more than 50 dairy goats or sheep are obliged to work the manure into the soil themselves or hire a company to do so or to compost it on site. Not all farms are able to meet this obligation, however. Alternative forms of processing, such as industrial composting or gasification are not allowed under current legislation. Composting is a manure fermentation process that kills bacteria as temperatures rise. Exact levels of Coxiella in the manure and how effectively they are killed in the standard fermentation process cannot be determined to date but will be assessed as soon as possible. A comparison between traditional and industrial composting processes shows that their effectiveness is basically similar and that pasteurisation can compensate for the small difference. The Director of the Risk Assessment Bureau has based this recommendation on a risk assessment, permitting the transport of dairy goats and sheep manure from farms free from Q fever to industrial composters, provided that pasteurisation is made part of the process. Manure from farms where Q fever has been confirmed is expected to contain high levels of Coxiella and may therefore contribute to spreading this disease. For this reason, this manure must be sterilised or incinerated.

40|$|Osteochondrosis (OC) {{is seen as}} {{the main}} cause of leg {{weakness}} in pigs, leading to welfare problems and economic losses. Environmental factors in pig husbandry, such as the housing system and feeding strategy are expected to influence the prevalence of OC. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of housing system and feeding strategy on the prevalence and severity of OC. In the experiment 345 pigs were used. At an age of 69 days intact boars and gilts were separated and assigned to groups of five or six individuals. A two by two factorial design of housing system and feeding strategy was applied. The housing system was either a conventional concrete floor partial slatted, or a <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> floor with extra space allowance. The feeding strategy was either ad libitum or restricted to 80 % of ad libitum. Pigs were slaughtered at the age of 161 – 176 days. In total, five joints of the left front and hind limbs were macroscopically assessed for OC on a five-point scale, ranged from no OC through (semi-) loose cartilage fragments. The prevalence of OC in the experimental population was 41. 4 %, and 12. 4 % of the individuals had severe lesions. The tarsocrural joint was most affected (30. 2 %) by OC. OC scores between the different joints were not correlated. Medial sections of joints were most affected (63 – 100 %). Boars were more affected than gilts in the elbow joint. Conventionally housed pigs were more affected than <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> <b>housed</b> pigs. Ad libitum fed pigs had more OC than restrictedly fed pigs.

A total number of 2000 day old chicks of Rajasree were reared in <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> <b>house</b> up to 9 weeks under controlled conditions to record the body weight, feed consumption and feed conversion ratio. After 9 weeks, 1800 birds were equally distributed to 60 beneficiaries (20 females and 10 males) in four villages of Nalgonda district of Andhra Pradesh to record the body weight, feed consumption and feed conversion ratio under the backyard condition up to 20 weeks. At the age of day old, the average weight of male and female chicks was 33 and 30 g, respectively. The male and female average body weight gains and feed consumption at 9 th week were 582 and 491 g and 1868 and 1951 g, respectively. The feed conversion ratio at 9 th week was 3. 20 and 3. 97 respectively. The average mortality was 3. 12 % up to 9 weeks. The male and female mean body weight at 20 th week were 1160. 7 and 1006. 9 g under backyard farming.

The chemical composition of the dried blood meal was 92 % dry matter, 80 % crude protein, 8. 5 % total ash, 1. 2 % ether extract, 1. 3 % crude fibre, 9 % nitrogen free extract, 0. 28 % calcium, 0. 25 % phosphorus, 1. 98 % sodium chloride and 2850 Kcal kg - 1 metabolizable energy. Amino acid profile revealed that sufficient quantity of almost all essential amino acids was present in blood meal. Chemical score of the blood meal was 13. Isoleucine was the Ist limiting amino acid and methionine was the 2 nd limiting amino acid. Three hundred, day-old broiler chicks were reared in <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> <b>house</b> system using completely randomized design.

We investigated the effect of four organic farming systems with different livestock densities and different types of organic manure on crop yields, nitrate leaching and N balance in an organic dairy/crop rotation (barley – grass-clover – grass-clover – barley/pea – winter wheat – fodder beet) from 1994 until 1998. Nitrate concentrations in soil water extracted by ceramic suction cups ranged from below 1 mg NO 3 -N/l in 1 st year grass-clover to 20 - 50 mg NO 3 -N/l in the winter following barley/pea and winter wheat. Peaks of high nitrate concentrations were observed in 2 nd year grass-clover, probably due to urination by grazing cattle. Nitrate leaching was affected by climatic conditions (drainage volume), livestock density and time since ploughing in of grass-clover. No difference in nitrate leaching was observed between the use of slurry alone and farmyard manure from <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> <b>housing</b> in combination with slurry. Increasing the total-N input to the rotation by 40 kg N/ha per year (from 0. 9 to 1. 4 livestock units/ha) only increased leaching by 6 kg NO 3 -N/ha.

40|$|The {{past few}} years in Zimbabwe have seen {{a rise in the}} number of {{smallholder}} farmers taking up commercial poultry production. Past research has also shown that smallholder poultry production suffers from low profitability emanating from high mortality rates caused by disease outbreaks, low laying rates and increasing cost of feed among other things. This study aimed at investigating the profitability of smallholder commercial egg production in Zimbabwe given the constraints which farmers face. The study used descriptive statistics to provide a general description of 260 randomly sampled commercial egg producing households supported by Non Governmental Organisations for producing eggs under the cage and <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system. The study revealed that the average age of the heads of sampled households was 55 years and most of these heads were educated (96. 1 %). Hen performance under the cage system was relatively better when compared to that under the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system, measured by parameters such as mortality rate, laying rate, cumulative hen housed eggs and feed conversion ratio. The K-S test for equality of distributions also revealed that both farmers operating under the cage and <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system were operating below optimal levels expected. The gross margin analysis was also applied and it revealed that feed costs were the major factor contributing to total production costs in percent terms 56. 1, 56. 29, 47. 41 and 45. 76 for the 6 birds caged, 12 birds caged, 18 birds caged and 20 birds in the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system respectively. The returns per dollar invested were USD 0. 48, USD 0. 39, USD 0. 63 and a negative USD 0. 04 for the 6 birds caged, 12 birds caged, 18 birds caged and 20 birds in the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system respectively. The coefficient of private profitability revealed that it is profitable to produce eggs under the cage system at all flock levels while on the other hand it is not profitable to produce under the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system at the prevailing level of production and prices. A generalised linear model was also fitted to estimate the hypothesised determinants of profitability per 1000 eggs by applying the Ordinary Least Squares. The Ordinary Least Squares regression revealed that a 1 kg increase in feed required to produce a dozen eggs will result in USD 30. 26 decline in profit per 1000 eggs. Holding other factors constant, farmers which faced difficulties in getting customers for their eggs experienced a USD 9. 20 decline in profit per 1000 eggs. Farmers operating under the cage system earned USD 27. 33 more profit than those operating under the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system. Being a member to a poultry producer association resulted in USD 14. 98 more profit than not being a member. Households which were headed by males had USD 6. 80 more profit than their female counterparts. The thematic analysis of data from focus group discussions revealed that egg producing households had weak linkages with input suppliers. The farmers perceived poor physical infrastructure to be fuelling costs of production in commercial eggs. The farmers also identified lack of access to credit as a bottle neck which was resulting in limited expansion of the egg enterprise. From the results of the study, it can be deduced that high feed costs, labour costs, veterinary costs, building costs and mortality rate are associated with lower profitability while on the other hand higher laying rate results in increased profit. Hen performance under the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> <b>housing</b> system performed poorly when compared to that under cages. Farmers are encouraged to produce home grown feed to minimise feed costs. Continued training with a change in approach was also recommended for improvement management of hens. Policy makers and investors willing to assist farmers can also channel resources towards the rehabilitation of the road network linking rural areas to major towns/cities for improved access to input and output markets. This study concluded by recommending that a study be commissioned to explore the use of home grown feeds for cost minimisation without compromising on productivity within the smallholder commercial egg enterpris...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of groundnut, and sesame meals, each as a sole vegetable protein supplement or in combinations, was studied {{to determine their}} feeding value in broiler diets. A six-weeks feeding trial was conducted utilizing day-old broiler chicks (Ross strain), housed in an open <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> <b>house.</b> The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized block design, consisting of 15 pens (experiment units), arranged in three rows (blocks) of five pens each, and each pen accommodated 10 experimental chicks. Five experimental diets, containing either groundnut meal (GNM 30 %) or sesame seed meal (SSM 30 %) or combined in different proportions (10, 15, 20 %), were formulated and randomized within each. Records were kept for daily mortality and weekly feed consumption and liveweight gain, weekly liveweight gain and feed conversion ratio were then assessed. At {{the end of the}} experiment, after slaughter, the plucked, eviscerated and dressed weight were measured and the dressing percentage was calculated. The collected data was then subjected to analysis of variance to estimate any statistical differences among the dietary treatments. The results indicated clearly that GNM or SSM when used as a sole vegetable protein supplement in the diet would not support optimum broiler growth, while the combination of the tow meals would significantly improve performance. These combinations resulted in significant increases in feed consumption (P< 0. 01) and in live body weight and liveweight gain (P< 0. 05), while the FCR was not significantly affected by the dietary treatments. The plucked, eviscerated and dressed weights of the hot carcass weight were significantly increased (P< 0. 05), while the dressing percentage was not affected by the dietary treatments. The improvement in performance of the birds fed the diets with combined GNM and SSM was attributed to the increase in feed and nutrients intake, compared to that of the birds fed diets with GNM or SSM as a sole vegetable protein supplements. The results indicated an effective mutual supplementary effect between the two vegetable protein supplements, which improved protein quality and amino acid pattern, and thus led to efficient protein utilization and growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of sesame seeds meal {{as the sole}} vegetable protein supplement was studied to assess its feeding value for broiler chicks' growth. A 6 -weeks feeding trial was conducted with day- old broiler chicks (Ross), reared in experimental pens in an open <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> <b>house.</b> Four experimental diets {{were used in the}} trial, which included a basal diet (diet 1) containing sesame meal as the sole vegetable protein supplement. This basal diet was supplemented with lysine, methionine or lysine plus methionine to produce diets 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The feeding trail was arranged {{in the form of a}} completely randomized block design, with three blocks and four experimental units (pens) per blocks, and each dietary treatment was replicated three times. Records were kept for weekly feed consumption, liveweight, feed conversion ratio and for final plucked and dressed carcass weights. The collected data was subjected to analyses of variance to find out any statistical differences among the dietary treatments. The results revealed clearly an inferior productive performance of the experimental chicks fed on the sesame-basal diet (diet 1), the methionine supplemented diet (diet 3) and the lysine+methionine vii i supplemented diet (diet 4). The performance was improved by supplementing the control sesame based diet with lysine alone. This indicates that sesame meal, as a sole vegetable protein supplement, is in adequate for broiler growth because of its short supply of lysine. The results also showed that the mean feed consumption was not significantly affected by the experimental diets, but it was markedly higher for the group of birds fed the lysine supplemented diet (diet 2). Final liveweight, plucked and dressed weights were also significantly increased by feeding (diet 2), and were reduced in the group of birds fed the methionine supplemented diet (diet 3). This latter group of birds had the highest feed conversion ratio, which was statistically different from the other dietary treatments. According to the results of the present study, it can be anticipated that, sesame seeds meal can be utilized effectively in broiler diets, to support satisfactory chicks' performance, provided the diet is supplemented with synthetic lysine to correct its deficiency in the sesame meal. Similarly lysine rich supplements can be combined with sesame meal supplement to correct for this amino acid deficiency and improve growth rate and feed utilization efficienc...|$|E

A number of hundred day-old commercial broiler chicks (Hubbard) were randomly allocated to twenty experimental pens, of one square meter area each, and located in an open <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> experimental <b>house.</b> Four experimental diets were formulated from the common local feed ingredients used in poultry feeding in the Sudan, and used in the trial. One diet served as a control diet, without addition of zinc acetate, a second diet was supplemented with 25 mg/Kg zinc acetate, a third diet with 50 mg/Kg zinc acetate, and a fourth diet was supplemented with 75 mg/Kg zinc acetate. The experimental diets were randomized to the experimental pens {{at the rate of}} five replicates per treatment, in a completely randomized design arrangement. The birds fed the zinc acetate supplemented diets had a significantly increased feed consumption (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Six hundred {{guinea fowl}} pullets, 5 week old, {{were used for}} a 30 week feeding trial to test the {{replacement}} value of poultry droppings (PD) for blood meal, a conventional protein ingredient, in animal feed. Guinea fowl is a wild bird found in the savanna forests of West Africa. There were four dietary treatments namely, 0, 20, 40 and 60 % PD replacement of blood meal. The birds were kept in <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> <b>houses</b> for 20 weeks. Feed and water were offered ad libitum. At the 20 th week, 10 birds {{were randomly selected from}} each of the four dietary treatments and starved for one day. They were killed in the slaughter house by cutting the neck through the jugular vein. This was used to determine the carcass parameters. The remaining birds were transferred into the layers house, where the following parameters were determined: body weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion, age at first lay, Percentage hen day production, egg weight, shell thickness and yolk colour. Results show that body weight gain and feed conversion decreased with the level of PD in the diet. There {{was no significant difference between}} the birds in carcass parameters in all the treatments except in oviduct length where its values decreased with the level of PD in the diet and significant differences (P< 0. 05) were observed among the birds raised on 0 and 60 % PD. The birds on 0 % PD attained point of lay two weeks earlier than those on 60 % PD. And there was a significant difference (P< 0. 05) between the birds on 0 % PD and those on 60 % PD diets in age at first lay. However, there was no significant difference among birds raised on diets with PD below 60 % PD. Feed intake increased with the level of PD and there was a significant difference (P 0 < 0. 05) between those raised on 0 and 60 % PD diets. Mortality was very low as only two birds were recorded dead in the 60 % PD diet throughout the experimental period. It was concluded that PD can be used to replace blood meal in the diet of guinea fowl up to 40 % without any adverse effect on its performance...|$|R
40|$|Background: It is well {{established}} now that fat deposition is governed by the genetic, nutritional and management practices. However, most influenced agent in this respect is the nutritional factors mainly phase feeding. Objectives: This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of phase feeding diets (starter, grower and finisher) on broiler performance, serum-carcass cholesterol and fatty acids profile. Material and Methods: A number of 90 chicks (Ross 308) from the healthy and uniform chicks were selected and (Ross 308) reared for six weeks in <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> open <b>house</b> and assigned randomly to the three dietary treatments each replicated three times (nine experimental pens, {{at the rate of}} ten chicks per pen). Treatment one consisted of one diet (starter) for all experimental period. Treatment two consisted of two diets (starter and grower) introduced three week for each. Treatment three consisted of three diets (starter, grower, finisher) each introduced for two weeks. Results: the phase feeding systems was significantly decreased the overall broiler performance, positive but insignificant effect on carcass parameters, provoked significant increase on liver, heart, and abdominal fat pad, and no significant effect on cholesterol and triglycerides of carcass, serum or abdominal fat pad was observed. Concussion: The phase feeding manipulation improved the carcass quality through elevating the cholesterol and triglycerides of the abdominal fat pad...|$|R
40|$|Increase in feed {{prices in}} recent years has stimulated renewed {{interest}} in the area of feed restriction and simultaneously the birds have to provide space for feeding, watering and normal movements for their optimum growth and production. Thus, a great emphasis has been laid on feeding system, which employs the use of quantitative or qualitative feed restriction. During growing phase 468 White Leghorn (WLH) birds from random bred control population <b>housed</b> on <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> <b>housing</b> system were exposed to three feeding regimes viz. T 1 (ad lib.), T 2 (Skip-two-days a week) and T 3 (75 % of ad lib.) on three different stocking densities viz. S 1 (2. 5 ft 2 /bird; 20 birds/pen), S 2 (2. 0 ft 2 /bird; 25 birds/pen) and S 3 (1. 5 ft 2 /bird; 33 birds/pen) to form nine combinations of feed regimes and stocking density. Between 20 to 32 weeks of age, T 1, T 2 and T 3 birds gained 31. 76, 45. 19 and 70. 82 percent of body weight. The T 1 xS 3 birds were heavier (1904. 5 ± 39. 9 g) than other groups at the end of laying phase. The maximum feed consumed by T 1 group (117. 91 ± 4. 17 g) followed by T 3 (116. 61 ± 3. 80 g) and T 2 group (108. 28 ± 3. 61 g), which differed significantly. T 1 xS 3 birds consumed daily about 102 g feed and was significantly lower from other interaction groups. The birds kept under T 3 xS 1 treatment gave maximum hen day egg production (64. 36 ± 6. 78 %) followed by T 1 xS 2 (63. 83 ± 0. 28 %) and T 1 xS 1 (61. 71 ± 4. 84 %). Hen housed egg production followed almost the same pattern with hen day egg production. Skip-two-days a week and 1. 5 -ft 2 / bird treatment (T 2 xS 3) produced eggs of 54. 52 ± 1. 24 g weights, which were acceptable in market. It appears that skip-two-days fed birds reared on the density of 1. 5 ft 2 /bird to be the most promising interaction group with respect to lower feed consumption during the laying period without any significant adverse effect on hen housed egg production. It appears that skip-two-days fed birds reared at the density of 1. 5 ft 2 /bird to be the most promising interaction group with respect to lower feed consumption during the laying period...|$|R
40|$|Ascaris suum is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} parasitic helminth in pig production systems worldwide. In most industrialized countries production systems are highly intensive and fully in-doors (low prevalence of parasites) {{but there is a}} growing market for pigs produced out-door or under organic pig farming conditions (high prevalence of parasites). In organic pig production there is a number of factors related to housing and management practices that predispose for A. suum infections. These practices include restricted use of anthelmintics, late weaning of piglets (after min seven weeks of age) and access to outdoor runs. Provision of bedding material, which might be conducive for development and survival of free-living stages of helminths, is mandatory in organic production systems but the amount and type of bedding material vary between farm and housing systems. The differences in A. suum egg development in different housing systems have been poorly described. Biodegradation of organic matter in <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> <b>housing</b> systems produces physico-chemical conditions which may affect the development and survival of A. suum eggs, but little is known about such effects. Understanding the ecology and transmission dynamics of A. suum may help prevent infections in organic farming. Pig slurry is used to fertilize crops in organic as well as conventional farming and may be treated to inactivate a variety of pathogens present in it before application. To achieve adequate pathogen inactivation, slurry may need to be stored for around one year which may not be ideal logistically and economically. Chemical treatment of slurry may reduce storage time needed to adequately inactivate pathogens. The eggs of A. suum are commonly used as a conservative indicator in estimating pathogen inactivation during slurry treatment as they are more resistant to environmental stress than bacterial and viral pathogens. The eggs of the poultry ascarid, Ascaridia galli are ubiquitous, resistant and available even in places where the eggs of A. suum cannot be found, e. g., areas without pig keeping, but {{little is known about the}} suitability of A. galli eggs as a conservative hygiene indicator. Currently, viability of A. suum eggs is estimated by their ability to embryonate which takes up to six weeks depending on temperature. There is a need to develop more rapid viability tests and in addition, embryonation cannot be used as a viability criterion for already embryonated eggs. A quantitative egg hatch test may thus be helpful for already embryonated eggs. The present Ph. D. project therefore addressed the above issues by investigating in six separate studies, the ecology and transmission of A. suum eggs in organic pig farms, including determination of conditions under which A. suum eggs are inactivated. ...|$|R
40|$|A 7 -weeks {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} to assess the effect of incorporation of beef tallow or groundnut oil in broiler diets on feed consumption, live weight gain, feed conversion ratio, dressing percentage and accumulation of abdominal fat. A number of ninety day-old commercial broiler chicks (Habbard) were randomly allocated to nine experimental pens, of one square meter area each, located in an open <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> experimental <b>house.</b> Three experimental diets were formulated from the common local feed ingredients used in poultry feeding in the Sudan, and used in the trial. One diet served as a control diet without addition of lipid, a second diet was supplemented with 5 % groundnut oil, and the third diet with 5 % beef tallow. The experimental diets were randomized to the experimental pens {{at the rate of}} three replicates per treatment, in a completely randomized design arrangement. Incorporation of beef tallow in the diet resulted in improved chick performance compared to the other experimental diets. The birds fed the beef tallow supplemented diet had a significantly higher feed and essential nutrients consumption (P< 0. 01) than the birds fed either of the two other experimental diets. This effect is related to improved palatability of beef tallow, and partially to the presence of increased saturated fatty acids, contributed by beef tallow in the diet. These effects resulted in improved growth rate and body weight gain, efficient feed conversion ratio and increased abdominal fat deposition in the birds fed the tallow diet. These effects were well marked, though they were not statistically significant...|$|R
