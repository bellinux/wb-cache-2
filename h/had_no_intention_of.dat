They were charged with conspiring to commit fraud and soliciting loans they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> repaying. LaRouche and his supporters disputed the charges, claiming the trials were politically motivated.|$|E

5|$|On 21 February, Souvanna {{signed an}} Agreement on the Restoration of Peace and Reconciliation in Laos between the central {{government}} and the Pathet Lao. The agreement was preceded by intense fighting, as both sides attempted to seize as much territory as possible before the cease-fire went into effect.

5|$|Philip <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> {{handing over}} Amphipolis to the Athenians, but {{acted as if}} he was just delaying the {{transfer}} of the city. He seems to have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to have tried to intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E

The war ended before the issue was resolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortunes}} of Gray's Inn continued to decline after the English Restoration, and by 1719 only 22 students were joining the Inn a year.

In 1615, 13 students joined the Inn for every student called to the Bar, but by 1713 the ratio had become 2.3 new members to every 1 call.|$|E

5|$|During {{his second}} round match, O'Sullivan {{opened up a}} four frame {{advantage}} over Murphy in the first session to lead 6−2.

The third session saw no comeback from Murphy and O'Sullivan progressed to the quarter-finals 13−7. The quarter-finals would be the furthest O'Sullivan would progress, as he fell behind Ding Junhui 6–10 after the opening two sessions. Despite scoring the tournament's highest break with a 146 in the final session, he would eventually lose 10–13. Following his loss, O'Sullivan stated that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> retiring.|$|E

Finally, the third naval vessel left in mid-September, its commander promising to return in three weeks—a promise he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> keeping.

Ruth also found out that far from giving him {{a share of the}} profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of his money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet. As it turned out, both Fuchs and Ruppert had known all along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.|$|E
