The model is then specialized to account for recent experiments with an elastomer, where the electric displacement is linear in the electric field when the strain of the elastomer is held fixed, but the permittivity changes appreciably when the strain changes. Our model couples this quasi-linear dielectric behavior with nonlinear elastic behavior.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A three-dimensional, {{electromechanical}} constitutive law {{has been}} formulated for electrostrictive ceramic materials. This fully coupled, phenomenological model relates the key state variables of stress, strain, electric field, polarization and temperature {{in a set of}} compact nonlinear equations. The direct and converse <b>electrostrictive</b> <b>effects</b> are modeled by assuming that the electri-cally induced strain depends on second-order polarization terms. In addition, a simple empirical relationship for the dielectric behavior is used to model the saturation of the induced polarization with increasing electric field. Unlike previous electrostrictive constitutive laws based on polynomial expansions, this consti-tutive law depends on a manageable number of material constants. As an example, material constants for the model were determined from induced strain and dielectic data for a relaxor-ferroelectric based on lead magnesium niobate, Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2) O 3 -PbTiOBa (PMN-PT-BT).

40|$|Electrostriction {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the electromechanical behavior of ferroelectrics and describes a phenomenon in dielectrics where the strain varies proportional to the square of the electric field/polarization. Perovskite ferroelectrics demonstrating high piezoelectric performance, including BaTiO 3, Pb(Zr 1 -xTix) O 3, and relaxor-PbTiO 3 materials, have been widely used in various electromechanical devices. To improve the piezoelectric activity of these materials, efforts have been focused on the ferroelectric phase transition regions, including shift the composition to the morphotropic phase boundary or shift polymorphic phase transition to room temperature. However, there is not much room left to further enhance the piezoelectric response in perovskite solid solutions using this approach. With the purpose of exploring alternative approaches, the <b>electrostrictive</b> <b>effect</b> is systematically surveyed in this paper. Initially, the techniques for measuring the <b>electrostrictive</b> <b>effect</b> are given and compared. Second, the origin of electrostriction is discussed. Then, the relationship between the electrostriction and the microstructure and macroscopic properties is surveyed. The electrostrictive properties of ferroelectric materials are investigated with respect to temperature, composition, phase, and orientation.

A square shaped finite sized constrained ferroelectric system with vanishing surface polarization is considered.

The anions gives rise to a cathodic shift in the respective redox potentials in the sequence PF 6 -, BF 4 - ø ClO 4 -, tos-, with the magnitude of the shifts being largest for the tri-nuclear and smallest for the mononuclear species. In one dinuclear complex, a variation of anion was also observed to affect the difference in potentials between the [6 +/ 5 +] and [5 +/ 4 +] couples. These effects are consistent with known specific association of the anions with metal complexes of this type. In the presence of PF 6 -, high-pressure electrochemical studies revealed the molar volume changes for successive redox couples in di- and rinuclear complexes were almost invariant (ÄVcomplex = 24 ± 2 cm 3 mol- 1) and consistent with the value for mononuclear species.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Materials {{for energy}} storage have become {{increasingly}} important {{in the modern world}} as alternatives to petrochemical energy sources. Although technology such as lithium-ion batteries and solid oxide fuel cells are in commercial use, improvements must still be made to increase widespread adoption. To this end, nanostructured materials have emerged as potentially impactful solutions, as they can greatly improve the performance of the energy storage device. One goal of this dissertation was to fabricate nanostructured materials through solution-based processing, electrospinning, and controlled annealing for lithium-ion battery electrodes. This project resulted in the formation of porous fibers from inexpensive, nontoxic materials that can be used as high capacity electrodes. Another component of this dissertation was to deposit thin film noble metals and metal oxides via sputtering for metal-air battery cathodes. The results from these experiments indicate that nanostructured thin films could have improved catalytic activity compared to polycrystalline bulk structures, and also were lower cost due to the decrease in material used. The other major portion of this dissertation was to study the fundamental behavior of nanostructured materials for energy storage at a localized level using electrochemical strain microscopy, a technique that is still in its infancy. The measured responses using electrochemical strain microscopy tended to be difficult to interpret, as they contained many different chemical and mechanical contributions. A series of experiments were devised to distinguish among the different mechanisms, comparing differing responses from Vegard strain, ferroelectric behavior, and <b>electrostrictive</b> <b>effects.</b> Given this framework, inhomogeneous lithium iron phosphate was characterized using electrochemical strain microscopy. From these results, it was found that nanocrystalline particles had higher lithium ion diffusivity as compared to microcrystalline particles, which correlates with macroscopic electrochemical performance. Furthermore, this technique could be applied to measure local lithium ion concentration in samples at different states of charge. Electrochemical strain microscopy was also applied to study samarium doped ceria, a solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte. In this case, the measured behavior was found to be due to the motion of small polarons, supporting the space-charge model of mixed ionic and electronic conductivity in nanostructured electrolytes. Electrochemical strain microscopy was found to be a strong and versatile technique that can fundamentally characterize local behavior of ions, vacancies, electrons, and holes in an energy storage material, and can guide future research in this area...|$|E

In the original intended application, the liquid would be a spacecraft propellant and the goal would be to force the ullage (comprising bubbles of noncondensible gas) to coalesce {{at one end of}} the tank, to enable use of one of the established means of (1) measuring the position of the gas/liquid interface and (2) inferring the quantity of liquid from the measurement. Electrically insulated wires would be installed in the tank, shaped and positioned so that application of a suitably high potential (e. g., 1 kV) between adjacent wires in successive pairs would give rise to a sufficient electric field gradient along the tank. The resulting electrostriction in the liquid would give rise to a pressure gradient that would force the ullage toward the low-electric-field-magnitude end of the tank.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Polyacrylate {{dielectric}} elastomers {{have yielded}} extremely large strain and elastic energy density {{suggesting that they}} are useful for many actuator applications. A thorough understanding of the physics underlying the mechanism of the observed response to an electric field can help develop improved actuators. The response {{is believed to be}} due to Maxwell stress, a quadratic dependence of the stress upon applied electric field. Based on this supposition, an equation relating the applied voltage to the measured force from an actuator was derived. Experimental data fit with the expected behavior, though there are discrepancies. Further analysis suggests that these arise mostly from imperfect manufacture of the actuators, though there is a small contribution from an explicitly electrostrictive behavior of the acrylic adhesive. Measurements of the dielectric constant of stretched polymer reveal that the dielectric constant drops, when the polymer is strained, indicating the existence of a small <b>electrostrictive</b> <b>effect.</b> Finally, measurements of the electric breakdown field were made.

The widespread interest in electroactive polymers is primarily attributed to the <b>electrostrictive</b> <b>effect</b> that manifests in the stretching and compression of the soft polymer, when voltage {{is applied to the}} electrodes. The degree of deformation is proportional to the square of the applied electric field, therefore it is important to study the effect of high voltages on EAP.

Ramp and step-up breakdown tests were performed on PU films with and without compliant electrodes, in order to determine the breakdown strength of the samples. The investigation showed that the electrical behaviour of a PU film can be affected by the type of electrodes that are attached to the surface of the polymer. Gold sputtered electrodes have a good adhesion, but they do not stretch along with the PU film under voltage excitation. This results in cracks, reducing the performance of the electrode surface.

Specifically, electro-active nanocomposites would enable {{a whole new}} set of applications, where the nanocomposite material would exhibit strength, toughness, and electromechanical coupling. The broad goal of this thesis was to investigate potential electromechanical behavior in single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) -polyimide (PI) composites. The specific objective was to measure and characterize the actuation response of SWNT??????PI nanocomposites. Two different polyimides, non-polar CP 2, and a weakly piezoelectric polymer (beta-CN) APB-ODPA are used in the study. Electrical and dielectric characterization of the nanocomposites were carried out to better understand the effect of SWNTs on the different physical properties of the composites, and to identify the electroactive mechanism in the resulting composites. (beta-CN) APB-ODPA composites show a higher increase in both conductivity and dielectric constant with SWNT content as compared to the CP 2 composites. The effect of SWNTs on remnant polarization (PR) is quantified using the dielectric relaxation tests and Thermally Stimulated Current (TSC) experiments. Both experiments show an increase in the remnant polarization with SWNT content and a higher value for the (beta-CN) APBODPA nanocomposites over CP 2 nanocomposites. Actuation tests employing a cantilever bending experiment were carried out on the nanocomposite samples while varying the SWNT content and electric field. The strains are seen to be proportional to the square of the electric field, indicating an electrostrictive response. Strain rate and the coefficient of electrostriction (M 1333) values are seen to increase with SWNT content and are higher for (beta-CN) APB-ODPA nanocomposites than the CP 2 nanocomposites. Electrostrictive strains can also be expressed as the square of polarization; hence the findings of the dielectric relaxation studies and TSC measurements can be correlated to the measured <b>electrostrictive</b> <b>effect.</b> The cause for the enhancement in dielectric, dielectric relaxation and actuation response of the nanocomposites with the increase in the SWNT content and polarity of the matrix was explored.

Although more and more studied, additional scientific investigations are required, especially in oxide interfaces, where new and amazing phenomena can arise. A prototypical example is the LaAlO 3 -SrTiO 3 interface that appear to be conducting, magnetic or even supra-conducting while these properties are not present in the LaAlO 3 and SrTiO 3 bulk insulator compounds. The conductivity arises from the formation of a highly localized electron gas at the interface which exhibits a different behavior than the one at semiconductor interfaces. Even nowadays, its exact origin, intrinsic versus extrinsic, is still intensively debated. The existence of an electric field in LaAlO 3 used as a key feature of models based on an intrinsic origin is highly controversial. In these models, the closing of the band gap with increasing LaAlO 3 film thicknesses finally results to a Zener breakdown and to the metal/insulator transition. In this Ph. D. thesis we aim to investigate the various consequences of the presence of an electric field in LaAlO 3 through first-principles calculations in pristine LaAlO 3 -SrTiO 3 interfaces. First, using both experimental and theoretical structural distortions in LaAlO 3, we predicted a lattice expansion via an <b>electrostrictive</b> <b>effect,</b> supporting the existence of an electric field in LaAlO 3. Second, the metal/insulator transition was tuned with regards to the intensity of the electric field in the film, which was controlled by the composition of a solid solution between LaAlO 3 and SrTiO 3. The theoretical results match the experimental one where, nevertheless, extrinsic origin mechanisms are allowed and defects are present. These two works are in favors of an intrinsic origin of the electronic gas observed in LaAlO 3 -SrTiO 3 heterostructures. In addition, a relationship between the sheet carrier density and spatial extension of the gas was established and thus setting an intrinsic threshold to the sheet carrier concentration. At lower density the electrons are strictly localized close to the interface while above this value the carriers start to spill into the SrTiO 3 substrate...|$|R

The nonlinear circuit model, essential for the material characterization and device characterization including linearity analysis, is developed based on the physics of electrostriction-based intrinsically switchable FBARs. Modeling results are in close agreement with dc-bias-voltage and RF-power-level dependent measurement results for BST FBARs. Second, the design methods for BST-on-Si composite FBARs are presented.

Temperature-dependent characteristics of BST-on-Si composite FBAR devices are also presented with the measured TCF of - 35 ppm/K. Furthermore, a raised-frame technique, which has been used to eliminate lateral-wave spurious-modes in piezoelectric BAW resonators, is first employed for switchable ferroelectric FBARs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the frame technique. Finally, the design method for intrinsically switchable BST FBAR filters is presented. The filter design method for ladder-type BAW filters is developed based on image parameters. Closed-form equations are derived for the first time enabling one to accurately design BAW filters. A systematically-designed pi-type BST FBAR filter is fabricated and measured, exhibiting a 1. 22 % bandwidth at 1. 97 GHz with an isolation of greater than 22 dB, having a very small device size of 0. 021 mm 2...|$|R
40|$|Electroactive {{thin-film}} polymers {{are increasingly}} being used as sensors and actuators in aerospace structures [1, 2]. They also have significant potential for applications in muscle mechanisms and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). In these applications, polymer films of thickness varying between 20 and 300 μm are utilized. Actuation of these polymers is attributed to piezoelectric, <b>electrostrictive</b> or electrostatic <b>effects.</b> Recent investigations suggest that polymers may produce striction which can be stronger than that delivered by electroactive ceramics. Such response may be produced by polymers with isotacticity or syndiotacticity in their molecular structure, where tacticity is {{the position of a}} pendant polymer group with a strong dipole moment that is mounted on a backbone polymeric chain...|$|R
40|$|Multiferroic ceramic solid {{solutions}} {{between the}} ferroelectric relaxor Pb(Fe 2 / 3 W 1 / 3) O- 3 (PFW) and "normal" ferroelectric PbTiO 3 (PT) - PFW-PT have been synthesized by a modified B-site precursor method and characterized by microwave dielectric measurements. A dielectric dispersion {{occurring in the}} frequency range of 100 MHz- 3 GHz and in {{a broad range of}} temperatures showed to be a powerful tool to detect <b>electrostrictive</b> and magnetostrictive <b>effects.</b> Anomalies in the temperature dependence of the dielectric parameters (f(R) (characteristic frequency) and the dielectric strength Delta epsilon (characteristic of the dispersion)) have been observed at T-N and T-C for all samples, indicating that the coupling between the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic orders occurs "via strain" and confirming the high sensitivity of microwave dielectric measurements to probe weak transitions in bulk ceramics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the theory and}} measured results of a low-noise un-cooled infrared (IR) detector, which uses a combination of piezoelectric, pyroelectric, <b>electrostrictive,</b> and resonant <b>effects</b> to achieve high sensitivity. The sensor consists of a high-Q gallium nitride (GaN) micro-mechanical resonator coated with an IR absorber layer. The IR absorber converts the IR energy into heat. The generated heat causes {{a shift in the}} frequency characteristics of the GaN resonators. IR detection is achieved by sensing the shift in the resonance frequency of the exposed GaN resonator as compared to a reference resonator. A prototype GaN-based IR sensor is implemented, showing a frequency shift of 400 Hz per µW of absorbed power. The change in the beat frequency upon IR radiation is 1830 ppm/µW, making it possible to sense IR radiation in nano watts range...|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000327181400017 International audienceThis paper proposes {{the direct}} {{calculation}} of the microscopic contributions to the magneto-electric coupling, using ab initio methods. The electrostrictive and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya contributions were evaluated individually. For this purpose a specific method was designed, combining density functional theory calculations and embedded fragment, explicitly correlated, quantum chemical calculations. This method allowed us to calculate {{the evolution of the}} magnetic couplings as a function of an applied electric field. We found that in YMnO 3 the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya contribution to the magneto-electric effect is three orders of magnitude weaker than the <b>electrostrictive</b> contribution. Strictive <b>effects</b> are thus dominant in the magnetic exchange evolution under an applied electric field, and by extension in the magneto-electric effect. These effects however, remain quite small, and the modifications of the magnetic excitations under an applied electric field will be difficult to observe experimentally. Another important conclusion is that it can be shown that the linear magneto-electric tensor is null due to the inter-layer symmetry operations...|$|R
