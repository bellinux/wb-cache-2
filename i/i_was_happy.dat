[...] "If I never did another CD, this is the one I will always point to as the one that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> with the most," [...] said Owen {{at the time of its}} release.

500|$|The album debuted on the Billboard 200 {{at number}} 144. Geffen shipped {{about half of}} the initial US {{pressing}} to the American Northwest, where it sold out quickly and was unavailable for days. Geffen reputedly put production of all other albums on hold in order to fulfill demand in the region. Nevermind was already selling well but, over the next few months, the momentum increased significantly as [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] unexpectedly became more and more popular. The song's video had received a world premiere on MTV's late night alternative show 120 Minutes but it soon proved so popular that the channel began playing it during the day. The record was soon certified Gold, but the band was relatively uninterested in the achievement. Novoselic recalled, [...] "Yeah <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> about it. It was pretty cool.

[...] Reviewing {{the first part of the}} eighth season, TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote: [...] "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman.

500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was at home}} to Charlton Athletic.

An away trip to local rivals Tottenham Hostpur became {{magnified}} with interest, given it marked the return of Campbell following his move to Arsenal. An 81st-minute goal scored by Pirès put Arsenal into the lead, before a lapse by Wright in goal allowed Gus Poyet‘s shot to squirm from his grasp and enter the goalnet. Arsenal then faced league champions Manchester United {{and in spite of}} conceding inside 14 minutes through a Paul Scholes’ strike, Ljungberg equalised for them [...] "with a wonderful chipped finish, following Gary Neville's wretched error." [...] Arsenal improved in the second half but scored in unforeseen fashion: United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez passed the ball directly into the feet of Henry, who profited from the error and scored. Five minutes later, Barthez's failure to grasp the ball presented Henry the chance to score his second, which he did. Both Henry and Wenger defended the opposition goalkeeper, with the former, his international teammate saying: [...] "Of course <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> to score the goals but it was strange.
