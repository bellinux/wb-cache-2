25|$|According to folklore, {{the first}} major shamal {{occurring}} around May 25 {{is known as the}} Al-Haffar, or driller, since it drills huge depressions in desert sand dunes. The second, arriving in early June, coincides with the dawn star, Thorayya (Pleiades), and is therefore named Barih Thorayya. During this event, which is more violent than the others, fishermen usually remain in port because ancient folklore tells them that this wind devours ships. Near the end of June, the last shamal arrives, known as the Al-Dabaran, or the follower. It is violent and continues for several days. Local residents keep doors and windows firmly shut as this shamal includes an all-penetrating fine dust which gets <b>into</b> <b>everything.</b>|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the missions, the native peoples knew only how to utilize bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and so forth. The missionaries established manual training in European skills and methods; in agriculture, mechanical arts, and the raising and care of livestock. Everything consumed and otherwise utilized by the natives was produced at the missions {{under the supervision of the}} padres; thus, the neophytes not only supported themselves, but after 1811 sustained the entire military and civil government of California. The foundry at Mission San Juan Capistrano was the first to introduce the Indians to the Iron Age. The blacksmith used the mission's forges (California's first) to smelt and fashion iron <b>into</b> <b>everything</b> from basic tools and hardware (such as nails) to crosses, gates, hinges, even cannon for mission defense. Iron in particular was a commodity that the mission acquired solely through trade, as the missionaries had neither the know-how nor technology to mine and process metal ores.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the missions, the native peoples' way of life involved the utilization bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and so forth.

The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour.

[...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist {{when it comes down}} to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to show people what I can really do." ...|$|E

[...] Born to Run remained the standard full album choice {{for the rest of the}} tour, but the two shows at New York's Madison Square Garden saw The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle and The River, with the latter's 20-song length dominating the setlist.

[...] Juli Weiner of Vanity Fair wrote, [...] "the episode was quick, sharp, and consistent". Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed Tracy's plot here, noting that his attempts to deliver a single line was highly entertaining. The Cornell Daily Suns Scott Eidler said that Jenna and Kenneth's subplot [...] "wasn't laugh-out-loud funny", nonetheless [...] "it was a nice realistic turn for characterization!" [...] Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline deemed [...] "Reaganing" [...] an excellent episode from the series. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club was positive about Jenna and Kenneth's story, noting it went from amusing to hilarious. He was not [...] "overly blown away" [...] with Liz's plot, but said it redeemed itself at the end [...] "by providing another nice moment of connection" [...] between the Jack and Liz characters. Rabin gave [...] "Reaganing" [...] a B+ grade, praising the (non-existent) scene where Jack put pills into Tracy's jelly beans. Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News said that {{the best part of}} the episode was Jack McBrayer's Kenneth [...] "actually [...] some funny lines for the first time [...]" [...] The Fordham Rams Celeste Kmiotek said that the episode was [...] "perhaps more awkward than normal... but it was nonetheless hilarious, and was tempered by its ability to throw cultural references <b>into</b> <b>everything</b> until you almost forget what is actually being discussed." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett liked Kelsey Grammer's appearance, but mostly enjoyed the fact that 30 Rock devoted an episode to Tina Fey's character as [...] "the sexual equivalent of a million Hindenburgs" [...] and was pleased with the numerous Liz flashbacks from past episodes that were featured here.|$|E
