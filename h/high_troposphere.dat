40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} the climatic impact of shortwave and longwave radiative forcing of Saharan {{dust on the}} West African monsoon and Sahel precipitation using a regional climate model (RCM) interactively coupled to a dust model and running for the period 1996 – 2006. Two competing effects are found. First a reduction of monsoon intensity in the lower troposphere induced by the dust surface cooling causes a reduction of precipitation, and second an ‘elevated heat pump effect' in the <b>higher</b> <b>troposphere</b> induced by the dust diabatic warming causes an increase of precipitation. In the standard model configuration, the net impact of these effects is a reduction of precipitation {{over most of the}} Sahelian region (by about 8 % on average) except over a Northern Sahel - Southern Sahara band, where precipitation increases. These patterns are very sensitive to the dust absorbing properties, which modulate the intensity of the patterns and the boundary between enhanced and decreased precipitation areas.

The ISCCP cloudiness analyses confirm that the warmest spots in the monthly WV images correspond to scenes either clear or covered with low clouds, whereas the coldest areas correspond to scenes where cloud tops above 440 hPa frequently occur. The WV statistics are then used to characterize seasonal and interannual variations of both the ITCZ (InterTropical Convergence Zone) and the warm (dry) areas, corresponding to subtropical subsidence. Thanks mainly to the seasonal variations, relationships between the variations in the ITCZ and in dry subtropical areas can be studied.

The chronology dates back to AD 1193 and was sampled in AD 1996 from living Juniperus tibetica trees. This first long-term tree-ring-based δ 18 O chronology for eastern Tibet provides a reliable archive for hydroclimatic reconstructions. Highly significant correlations were obtained with hydroclimatic variables (relative humidity, vapour pressure, and precipitation) during the summer season. We applied a linear transfer model to reconstruct summer season relative humidity variations over the past 800 years. More moist conditions prevailed during the termination of the Medieval Warm Period while a systematic shift during the Little Ice Age is not detectable. A distinct trend towards more dry conditions since the 1870 s is apparent. The moisture decline weakened around the 1950 s but still shows a negative trend. The mid- 19 th century humidity decrease is in good accordance with several multiproxy hydroclimate reconstructions for south Tibet. However, the pronounced summer relative humidity decline is stronger on the central and eastern TP. Furthermore, the relative humidity at our study site is significantly linked to the relative humidity at large parts of the TP. Therefore, we deduce that the reconstructed relative humidity is mostly controlled by local and mesoscale climatic drivers, although significant connections to the <b>higher</b> <b>troposphere</b> of west-central Asia were observed...|$|R

We compare singular vectors using the CAPE-norm with SVs using the more common total energy (TE) norm for a 2 -week summer period in 2007, which includes a case of mesoscale extreme rainfall in the south west of Finland. The CAPE singular vectors perturb the CAPE field by increasing the specific humidity and temperature of the parcel and increase the lapse rate above the parcel in the lower troposphere consistent with physical considerations. The CAPE-SVs are situated in the lower troposphere.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} {{a new version of the}} DARDAR (raDAR liDAR) classification derived from CloudSat and CALIPSO data. The resulting target classification called DARDAR v 2 is compared to the first version called DARDAR v 1. Overall DARDAR v 1 reports more cloud or rain pixels than DARDAR v 2. In the low troposphere this is because v 1 detects too many liquid cloud pixels, and in the <b>higher</b> <b>troposphere</b> this is because v 2 is more restrictive in lidar detection than v 1. Nevertheless, the spatial distribution of different types of hydrometeors show similar patterns in both classifications. The French airborne RAdar -LIdar (RALI) platform carries a CloudSat/CALIPSO instrument configuration (Lidar at a wavelength of 532 [*]nm and a 95 GHz cloud radar), as well as an EarthCare instrument configuration (High Spectral Resolution Lidar at 355 [*]nm and a 95 [*]GHz Doppler cloud radar). It therefore represents an ideal go-between for A-Train and EarthCare. The DARDAR v 2 classification algorithm is adapted to RALI data for A-Train overpasses during dedicated airborne field experiments using the lidar at 532 [*]nm and the radar Doppler measurements. The results from the RALI classification are compared with the DARDAR v 2 classification to identify where the classification should still be interpreted with caution.

According to Global Circulation Models simulations, expected response on the rise of GHGs forcing is tropical temperature altitude amplification - temperature increases faster in <b>higher</b> <b>troposphere</b> than in lower troposphere. In this paper, two satellite data sets, UAH MSU and RSS, were used to test altitude temperature amplification in tropic (20 °N- 20 °S) in the hiatus period. We compared data from satellite data sets from lower troposphere (TLT) and middle troposphere (TMT) in general and particularly for land and ocean (for UAH MSU). The results from both satellite measurements showed the presence of hiatus, i. e. slowdown of the temperature rise in the period 1998 - 2012 compared to period 1979 - 2012 (UAH MSU) and temperature fall for RSS data. Smaller increase, i. e. temperature fall over ocean showed that hiatus is an ocean phenomenon above all. Data for UAH MSU showed that temperature altitude amplification in tropic was not present either for period 1979 - 2012, or 1998 - 2012. RSS data set also do not show temperature altitude amplification either for longer (1979 - 2012), or for shorter period (1998 - 2012). RSS data for successive 15 -year periods from 1979 - 1993 till 1998 - 2012 does not show tropical temperature altitude amplification and in one case negative trend is registered in TLT and in two cases in TMT.

40|$|Abstract In {{this chapter}} we review the {{photochemical}} and thermochemical equilibrium theories {{for the formation}} of condensate clouds and photochemical haze in Saturn’s upper troposphere and stratosphere and show the relevant observa-tions from ground-based and spacecraft instruments. Based on thermochemical equilibrium models we expect ammonia ice crystals to dominate in the <b>high</b> <b>troposphere.</b> There is very little spectral evidence to confirm this idea. Thanks to a stel-lar occultation observed by the Cassini VIMS instrument we now have spectral evidence for a hydrocarbon stratospheric haze component, and we still seek evidence for an expected diphosphine stratospheric haze component. The vertical dis-tributions of stratospheric and upper tropospheric hazes have been mapped well with ground-based and Hubble Space tele-scope data, and Cassini data are beginning to add to this pic-ture. Polar stratospheric aerosols are dark at UV wavelengths and exhibit strong Rayleigh-like polarization which suggests that auroral processes are important for their formation as is the case for the jovian polar stratospheric haze. The cloud and haze structure exhibits a variety of temporal variation, in-cluding seasonal change, long-term secular change near the equator, and short-term changes with a complicated latitu-dinal structure, and still not understood.

40|$|The {{large-scale}} air-sea interaction {{over the}} equatorial Pacific proposed by Bjerknes is investigated. It was found {{from a study}} of the Canton Island record that ocean temperature, rainfall, trade wind flow, and equivalent potential temperature are related and undergo long-term variations with periods in excess of a year. Similar changes occur in the <b>high</b> <b>troposphere.</b> Satellite cloud observations, however, indicate important longitudinal variations near the Equator. During the abnormal rainy season of 1965 - 66 at Canton Island, the amount of cloudiness remained low over the eastern equatorial Pacific despite above-normal sea-surface temperatures. This suggests a continuation of the widespread subsidence usually present over this region, which is apparently part of a large-scale semipermanent zonal circulation. Satellite observations further show that there are three major “centers of action ” (standing eddies) {{in the vicinity of the}} Equator. Probably the major part of the condenstion heating necessary for the Hadley circulation occurs in these areas. This study also indicates a possible relation between equatorial rainfall in the central Pacific and the strength of the Northern Hemisphere westerlies as suggested by Bjerknes. In addition, rainfall appears to vary inversely with the eddy kinetic energy over the Northern Hemisphere suggesting an inverse relation with the large-scale planetary waves in the Northern Hemisphere. 1...|$|E

In this work we photolyzed mixtures of NH 3 and C 2 H 2 using ultraviolet radiation with a wavelength of 214 nm and measured the spectral transmission of the deposited films in the visible region (400 - 740 nm). From these transmission data we estimated the imaginary indices of refraction. Assuming that ammonia grains {{at the top of}} the GRS clouds are coated with this material, we performed layered sphere and radiative transfer calculations to predict GRS reflection spectra. Comparison of those results with observed and previously unreported Cassini visible spectra and with true-color images of the GRS show that the unknown GRS chromophore is spectrally consistent with the coupled NH 3 -C 2 H 2 photochemical products produced in our laboratory experiments.

High sea surface temperatures, ocean-land contrasts and complex terrain produce large precipitation and atmospheric heating rates whose spatial and temporal characteristics are relatively undocumented. Analyses identify interannual and intraseasonal LH variations, with a large fraction of the interannual variability induced by internal intraseasonal variability. Also, the analyses identify a spatial dipole of LH anomalies between the equatorial Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal regions occurring during the summer active and suppressed phases of the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation. Comparisons made between the TRMM-CSH and TRMM- 2 A 12 datasets indicate significant differences {{in the shape of the}} vertical profile of LH. Comparison of TRMM-LH retrievals with sounding budget observations made during the South China Sea Monsoon experiment shows a high correspondence in the timing of positive LH episodes during rainy periods. Negative values of LH, associated with radiative cooling and with <b>higher</b> <b>troposphere</b> cooling from non-precipitating clouds, are not captured by any of the TRMM datasets. In summary, LH algorithms based on satellite information are capable of representing the spatial and temporal characteristics of the vertically integrated heating in the Asian monsoon region. The TRMM-CSH presents better performance than TRMM- 2 A 12. However, the vertical distribution of atmospheric heating is not captured accurately throughout all different convective phases.

40|$|International audienceSeparating {{concentrations}} {{of carbon monoxide}} (CO) in the boundary layer {{from the rest of}} the atmosphere with nadir satellite measurements is of particular importance to differentiate emission from transport. Although thermal infrared (TIR) satellite sounders are considered to have limited sensitivity to the composition of the near-surface atmosphere, previous studies show that they can provide information on CO close to the ground in case of high thermal contrast. In this work we investigate the capability of IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) to retrieve near-surface CO concentrations, and we quantitatively assess the influence of thermal contrast on such retrievals. We present a 3 -part analysis, which relies on both theoretical forward simulations and retrievals on real data, performed for a large range of negative and positive thermal contrast situations. First, we derive theoretically the IASI detection threshold of CO enhancement in the boundary layer, and we assess its dependence on thermal contrast. Then, using the optimal estimation formalism, we quantify the role of thermal contrast on the error budget and information content of near-surface CO retrievals. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is usually accepted, large negative thermal contrast values (ground cooler than air) lead to a better decorrelation between CO concentrations in the low and the <b>high</b> <b>troposphere</b> than large positive thermal contrast (ground warmer than the air). In the last part of the paper we use Mexico City and Barrow as test cases to contrast our theoretical predictions with real retrievals, and to assess the accuracy of IASI surface CO retrievals through comparisons to ground-based in-situ measurements...|$|E

25|$|Clouds of this {{structure}} have both cumuliform and stratiform characteristics {{in the form}} of rolls, ripples, or patches. They generally form as a result of limited convection in an otherwise mostly stable airmass topped by an inversion layer. If the inversion layer is absent or <b>higher</b> in the <b>troposphere,</b> increased convective activity may cause the cloud layers to develop tops {{in the form of}} turrets consisting of embedded cumuliform buildups. The stratocumuliform group is divided into cirrocumulus (high-level), altocumulus (mid-level), and stratocumulus (low-level).|$|R
