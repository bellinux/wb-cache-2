Otherwise, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a lot of film 'the committee' takes over. They start juggling scenes around and taking out this and putting in that. They can't do it with my pictures. I cut in the camera and that's it. There's {{not a lot of}} film left on the floor when I'm finished.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard {{to know where to}} start dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of when you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the lines}} between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under {{pressure}} in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. Tucker Carlson and Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, [...] "When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary." [...] She has argued that The Daily Show success {{and access to the}} youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV. Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, they'll get a smash, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>'em</b> time enough," [...] {{answered}} Andy Yates, heartlessly. He was {{a student}} who courted attention and it galled {{him to see the}} Rovers the center of attraction.|$|R

2500|$|In January 1836, the unpopular {{government}} of the Duke of Broglie lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, and the King needed a new Prime Minister. As he had done in 1830, he chose a man he was certain would soon fail; [...] Adolphe Thiers. On the subject of Thiers, Louis-Philippe told Victor Hugo, [...] "He (Thiers) has spirit, but he is spoiled by {{the spirit of a}} parvenu; [...] he has shown himself to be insatiable." [...] Louis Philippe cited what he said was Talleyrand's view of Thiers: [...] "You will never make anything of Thiers, but nonetheless he will be an excellent instrument. But he is one of those men whom you can make use of only <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> satisfaction; but he is never satisfied. The misfortune, for you and for him, is that you cannot make him a cardinal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, they're {{not likely}} to harm you unless you corner them," [...] said Songbird Powell. [...] "They'll sneak away from you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> half a chance. It's only when they're cornered or when they're needing food that they are really combative." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I am not fit for it. You {{are as good}} as {{a father}} to those lost daughters of yours. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a sister-friend she ought to have set them a good example. Have I done that? Will they listen to a girl who is no better than themselves?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I? No, I am too old {{for such}} gems. Yet, Son, it might be well to keep them for a time, seeing that while they are your own they may <b>give</b> <b>you</b> more weight {{in the eyes of}} the Prince Peroa and others. Whereas <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> the lady Amada and she took them, perchance it might only be to see them return to the East, whither you tell me she is summoned by one whose orders may not be disobeyed." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Put the aristos away somewhere, maman Lemoine ... {{the whole}} thing may only be a scare ... the Marats may only be here about the aristos ... they will {{probably}} leave you alone <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> up ... perhaps you'll get a reward.... Put them away till some of this row subsides ... I'll talk to commandant Fleury if I can." ...|$|E
60|$|Next day the King made a {{friendly}} call without basket or band. His cocked hat was exchanged for a chimney-pot so 'shocking bad' that no coster would dare to don it. Such is {{the custom of}} the chiefs, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a good tile it goes at once into store. He made us promise a return-visit {{and set out to}} collect bearers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{had better}} {{continue}} the hunt, while I go home. If you should fall in with 'em tell Henry how matters stand. But, Mr. Risley, let me caution you not to be rash, if you catch sight of Mrs. Risley {{in the hands of}} the redskins. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the chance they'll burn you at the stake--and it won't help her a bit either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're {{different}} altogether," [...] said Buggins. [...] "They 'aven't {{the sound}} sense of Englishmen, and they 'aven't the character. There's {{a sort of}} tricky dishonesty about 'em--false witness and all that--of which an Englishman has no idea. Outside their courts of law--it's a pos'tive fact, Kipps--there's witnesses waitin' to be 'ired. Reg'lar trade. Touch their 'ats as you go in. Englishmen 'ave no idea, I tell you--not ord'nary Englishmen. It's in their blood. They're too timid to be honest. Too slavish. They aren't used to being free like we are, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>'em</b> freedom they wouldn't make a proper use of it. Now we----. Oh, Damn!" ...|$|R
60|$|They {{seemed in}} great poverty; which {{was no doubt}} natural, now that rapine was put down, and the chiefs kept no longer an open house; and the roads (even such a wandering, country by-track as the one I followed) were infested with beggars. And here again I marked a {{difference}} from my own part of the country. For our Lowland beggars--even the gownsmen themselves, who beg by patent--had a louting, flattering way with <b>them,</b> and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> a plack and asked change, would very civilly return you a boddle. But these Highland beggars stood on their dignity, asked alms only to buy snuff (by their account) and would give no change.|$|R
60|$|So far as I am concerned, Knox doesn't {{count in}} this. I want {{the letters and}} I want Tommy. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>give</b> <b>them</b> up, I'll divorce you on {{statutory}} grounds, and no woman, so divorced, can keep her child. In any event, I shall keep Tommy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jeekie not heathen now, Major, {{but plenty}} other things true in this world, besides Christian religion. I no want you do anything, but I say this--you {{go back to}} Asiki wearing Little Bonsa on head and dressed like Reverend uncle whom you very like, for he just your age then thirty years ago, and they give you all the gold you want, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> back Little Bonsa whom they love and worship for ever and ever, for Little Bonsa very, very old." ...|$|E
60|$|The parlor at Green Gables was {{a rather}} severe and gloomy apartment, with rigid {{horsehair}} furniture, stiff lace curtains, and white antimacassars that were always laid at a perfectly correct angle, except at such times as they clung to unfortunate people's buttons. Even Anne {{had never been able}} to infuse much grace into it, for Marilla would not permit any alterations. But it is wonderful what flowers can accomplish <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a fair chance; when Anne and Diana finished with the room you would not have recognized it.|$|E
60|$|Well, I wasn't {{going to}} have any of that sort of thing, by Jove! I'd seen so many cases of fellows who had become perfect slaves to their valets. I {{remember}} poor old Aubrey Fothergill telling me--with absolute tears in his eyes, poor chap!--one night at the club, that he had been compelled to give up a favourite pair of brown shoes simply because Meekyn, his man, disapproved of them. You have to keep these fellows in their place, don't you know. You have to work the good old iron-hand-in-the-velvet-glove wheeze. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a what's-its-name, they take a thingummy.|$|E
6000|$|... "In a week," [...] he said indulgently, [...] "you {{will become}} quite used to these things. In a month you would miss them terribly <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I do mean to {{tell you}} so,' replied Sikes. 'The old lady has had 'em these twenty years; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to <b>give</b> <b>'em</b> five hundred pound, they wouldn't be in it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You niver know, yer honor, {{what these}} natives may be up to. They'll smile with you one day, and stab ye the next. They're treacherous varmint, yer honor, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do but <b>give</b> <b>'em</b> the chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am {{not saying}} that {{in the course of}} our long {{association}} I have always found myself able to view Jeeves with approval. There are aspects of his character which have frequently caused coldnesses to arise between us. He is one of those fellows who, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a thingummy, take a what-d'you-call-it. His work is often raw, and he has been known to allude to me as [...] "mentally negligible". More than once, as I have shown, it has been my painful task to squelch in him a tendency to get uppish and treat the young master as a serf or peon.|$|E
6000|$|... "There'll be {{temporary}} receiverships, of course," [...] Daylight advised; [...] "but they won't bother none or last long. What {{you must do}} immediately is to save everybody--the men that have been letting their wages ride with me, all the creditors, and all the concerns that have stood by. There's the wad of land that New Jersey crowd has been dickering for. They'll take all {{of a couple of}} thousand acres and will close now <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> half a chance. That Fairmount section is the cream of it, and they'll dig up as high as a thousand dollars an acre for a part of it. That'll help out some. That five-hundred acre tract beyond, you'll be lucky if they pay two hundred an acre." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain de Leyba," [...] said he, [...] "I {{know not}} {{what may be}} the present policy of his Spanish Majesty with McGillivray and his Creeks in the south, but this I do believe," [...] and he brought down his fist among the papers, [...] "that the old French and Spanish {{treaties}} were right in principle. Here are copies of the English treaties that I have secured, and in them thousands of sovereigns have been thrown away. They are so much waste paper. Gentlemen, the Indians are children. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> presents, they believe you to be afraid of them. I will deal with them without presents; and if I had the gold of the Bank of England stored in the garrison there, they should not touch a piece of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton {{stopped and}} looked at him steadily. [...] "Then there will be trouble <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> way to <b>them</b> again. And you put in a good deal more than I ever told anybody. Now you haven't brains enough to figure out all that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} is meant for a cut," [...] said Lord Marney; [...] "but I wish {{the people were}} as well off {{in every part of}} the country as they are on my estate. They get here their eight shillings a week, always at least seven, and every hand is at this moment in employ, except a parcel of scoundrels who prefer woodstealing and {{poaching}}, and who would prefer wood-stealing and poaching <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> double the wages. The rate of wages is nothing: certainty is the thing; and every man at Marney may be sure of his seven shillings a-week for at least nine months in the year; and for the other three, they can go to the House, and a very proper place for them; it is heated with hot air, and has every comfort. Even Marney Abbey is not heated with hot air. I have often thought of it; it makes me mad sometimes to think of those lazy, pampered menials passing their lives with their backs to a great roaring fire; but I am afraid of the flues." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{you are my}} niece, I have {{undertaken}} {{to come to you}} and to tell <b>you</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>give</b> <b>'em</b> up within a week from this time, they'll proceed against you for--stealing 'em!" [...] Lady Linlithgow, as she uttered this terrible threat, bobbed her head at her niece in a manner calculated to add very much to the force of her words. The words, and tone, and gesture combined were, in truth, awful.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't force {{your way}} in," [...] I said. [...] "You must {{do one of}} two things. You must either give your names to the servant at the door, or you must {{withhold}} your names. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them,</b> you warn Nugent of what is coming--and {{he is not the}} man to let you into the house under those circumstances. If you take the other way, and keep your names concealed, you present yourselves as strangers. Is Nugent likely to be accessible to strangers? Would Lucilla, in her present position, consent to receive two men who are unknown to her? Take my word for it--you will not only gain nothing {{if you go to the}} house you will actually make it more difficult to communicate with Lucilla than it is already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a gala {{evening at}} the Grand Sybaris Hotel, and a special dinner was being served in the Amethyst dining-hall. The Amethyst dining-hall had almost a European reputation, {{especially}} with that section of Europe which is historically identified with the Jordan Valley. Its cooking was beyond reproach, and its orchestra was sufficiently highly salaried to be above criticism. Thither came in shoals the intensely musical and the almost intensely musical, who are very many, and in still greater numbers the merely musical, who know how Tchaikowsky's name is pronounced and can recognize several of Chopin's nocturnes <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> due warning; these eat in the nervous, detached manner of roebuck feeding in the open, and keep anxious ears cocked towards the orchestra for {{the first hint of}} a recognizable melody.|$|E
6000|$|As I {{stare at}} the Belfry, I think {{with a sort of}} smile of some of my friends in London who are quite sure of how {{children}} will turn out <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> what they call [...] "the right environment." [...] It is a troublesome thing, environment, for it sometimes works positively and sometimes negatively, and more often between the two. A beautiful environment may make a child love beauty; it may make him bored with beauty; most likely the two effects will mix and neutralise each other. Most likely, that is, the environment will make hardly any difference at all. In the scientific style of history (which was recently fashionable, and is still conventional) we always had a list of countries that had owed their characteristics to their physical conditions.|$|E
60|$|Money {{is unknown}} and valueless here--knives, cloth, and arrack forming the only medium of exchange, with tobacco for small coin. Every {{transaction}} {{is the subject}} of a special bargain, and the cause of much talking. It is absolutely necessary to offer very little, as the natives are never satisfied till you add a little more. They are then far better pleased than <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>given</b> <b>them</b> twice the amount at first and refused to increase it.|$|R
5000|$|... "How were {{we going}} to end this, without giving {{anything}} away, without making it too obvious, because the minute the audience's mind begins to work, you're on very dangerous ground. Because <b>if</b> <b>you</b> tell them too much, they're disappointed and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>give</b> <b>them</b> any clues, they get confused. So it's that fine line of giving the audience as they walk out, okay, I believe it's this or I believe it's that. We never gave more in the script." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 4th Test at Sabina Park, Kingston - Australia won by an {{innings and}} 53 runs. The final Test arrived with the {{scoreline}} one-all, {{and the crowd}} came out in force. [...] "They were noisy, knew their cricket, and could be intimidating <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> room", Reiffel recalled. [...] "The bowl was resounding in anticipation ...." [...] The Australian strategy was to occupy the crease and compile as large a total as possible, fearing the fourth-innings pitch. Steve Waugh, coming in at 73 for three, joined his brother Mark, [...] "batted magnificently and built a fortress strong enough to keep West Indies at bay. Mark nonchalantly scored a beautiful century before getting out, but by then he had helped Steve build a solid platform." [...] Inspired by Waugh's intrepid double century and the West Indies' depleted psychological funds, Reiffel picked up three quick wickets on the second-last evening. By the reckoning of Reiffel, it was this match — and, more specifically, Waugh's century, [...] "one of the greatest feats of batting I ever witnessed" [...] — which signified the transition of cricketing supremacy from the West Indies to Australia. It also secured the Frank Worrell Trophy.|$|R
