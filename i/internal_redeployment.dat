5000|$|In (French speaking) Belgium {{the term}} Procédure Renault {{has become a}} synonym for the {{consultation}} process leading to mass redundancies, due to a controversial mass layoff and resultant legislation in the late 1990s. When an employee has been laid off in Australia their employer has to give them redundancy pay, which {{is also known as}} severance pay. The only time that a redundancy payment doesn’t have to be paid is if an employee is casual, working for a small business or has worked for a business for less than twelve months. The redundancy compensation payment for employees depends on the length of time an employee has worked for an employer which excludes unpaid leave. If an employer can’t afford the redundancy payment they are supposed to give their employee, once making them redundant, or they find their employee another job that is suitable for the employee. An employer is able to apply for a reduction in the amount of money they have to pay the employee they have made redundant. An employer can do this by applying to the Fair Work Commission for a redundancy payment reduction. [...] A layoff is also known as a retrenchment in (South African English). In the UK, permanent termination due to elimination of a position is usually called redundancy. [...] Certain countries (such as Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, France and Germany), distinguish between leaving the company of one's own free will, in which case the person is not entitled to unemployment benefits, but may receive a onetime payment and leaving a company as part of a reduction in labour force size, in which case the person is entitled to them. A RIF reduces the number of positions, rather than laying off specific people, and is usually accompanied by <b>internal</b> <b>redeployment.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops {{new theory}} and {{evidence to show}} that human-capital based competitive advantage of firms varies with external markets, firm structure, and firm openness to factor markets. The dissertation includes three empirical studies. The first study examines how labor market frictions due to strict employment protection regulations can be a source of competitive advantage for affiliates of corporate groups over standalone firms in environments where benefits from internal market flexibility are high. Utilizing the variation in labor laws and capital market development across 16 West-European countries, the study finds a stronger competitive advantage for group affiliates in countries with rigid labor markets, but flexible capital markets. In these environments, group affiliates are more prevalent and they outperform standalone firms in terms of growth and profitability. The second study examines how structural features of a firm and the nature of managerial resources interact to influence top managerial mobility in corporate groups. Using a novel dataset on intragroup managerial mobility, the study documents decreased <b>internal</b> <b>redeployment</b> of managers to affiliates with minority shareholders, especially if those managers are high-performing. These results are driven by hired managers. In contrast, family-related managers, who are related to the controlling shareholders, {{are more likely to be}} deployed to partly-owned, strategically peripheral and affiliates operating in regions where societal trust levels are low. These results suggest the importance of trust as a managerial attribute. The third study examines how disclosure of firm performance affects top manager mobility into and out of firms. Using managerial mobility data for 610, 000 managers in over 32, 000 corporate groups across Europe, the study shows the key tradeoffs in managerial markets associated with disclosure: disclosing firms lose more managers, especially if firms are performing well. Importantly, those departing managers leave to larger firms and to positions of greater responsibility. However, the results suggest that disclosing firms are better able to acquire new managers from other high-performing firms. Further, survey evidence suggests that disclosing firms can mitigate managerial outflows by implementing better human capital management practices. The study contributes to understanding how firms can capture value from strategic human capital, while protecting and refreshing sources of competitive advantage that are embodied in firm's top management. Taken together, these three studies contribute to understanding conditions under which firms can capture value from strategic human capital, and the key tradeoffs associated with accumulating and protecting knowledge resources while tapping into external knowledge flows.
