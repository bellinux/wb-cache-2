5|$|Marian devotion {{grew from}} the 13th century, mostly forming around the {{concepts}} of the Immaculate Conception and her Assumption into heaven. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> venerated the possession of relics {{as a means to}} bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity. By the early 15th century, Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the most accessible intercessor with God. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in limbo was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth. The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century, an era that saw an unending demand for works depicting her likeness. From the mid-15th century, Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the Man of Sorrows.|$|E
25|$|We {{learn as}} girls that in ways both subtle and obvious, {{personal}} and political, our value as females is largely determined by how we look. … For black women, {{the domination of}} physical aspects of beauty in women's definition and value render us invisible, partially erased, or obsessed, sometimes for a lifetime, since most of us lack the major talismans of Western beauty. Black women find themselves involved in a lifelong effort to self-define <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> provides them no positive reflection.|$|E
25|$|Bulimia is {{more common}} {{among those who have}} a close {{relative}} with the condition. The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30% and 80%. Other risk factors for the disease include psychological stress, cultural pressure to attain a certain body type, poor self-esteem, and obesity. Living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> promotes dieting and having parents that worry about weight are also risks. Diagnosis is based on a person's medical history, however this is difficult as people are usually secretive about their binge eating and purging habits. Furthermore, the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa takes precedence over that of bulimia. Other similar disorders include binge eating disorder, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and borderline personality disorder.|$|E

500|$|The {{use of a}} {{pregnant}} sex symbol was in a sense an attempt to combat the pop culture representations of the anathema of the awkward, uncomfortable, and grotesquely excessive female form <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> values thinness. Leibovitz' candid portrayal drew {{a wide spectrum of}} responses from television, radio and newspaper personalities and the public at large ranging from complaints of sexual objectification to celebrations of the photograph as a symbol of empowerment. One of the judges in Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp. stated that the image evoked Botticelli's Birth of Venus. [...] The contemporary retrospective view of some is that this photograph is [...] "high art". The intent of the photograph was to portray pregnancy with a celebrity {{in a way that was}} bold, proud and understated in a [...] "anti-Hollywood, anti-glitz" [...] manner. It was successful in some regards as many perceived it as a statement of beauty and pride. However, many took offense and the cover drew unusually intense controversy for Vanity Fair in the form of ninety-five television spots, sixty-four radio shows, 1,500 newspaper articles and a dozen cartoons. Some stores and newsstands refused to carry the August issue, while others modestly concealed it in the wrapper evocative of porn magazines.|$|E
500|$|Of Smith's {{performance}} as Joey, O'Donovan opined that: [...] "For most drama series {{the presence of}} a key new character would have a tangible impact. But not Jonathan Creek, where characterisation has never been done in anything but the broadest brush strokes. Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek's pushy, inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably. Smith was no different. Ten minutes in and we'd forgotten she was anyone new." [...] In contrast, Mark Wright, reviewing the episode for The Stage, praised Smith's {{performance as}} Joey, deeming her to be [...] "a much more satisfying sidekick" [...] than Julia Sawalha's Carla Borrego. He enjoyed the on-screen relationship between the two lead actors, writing that: [...] "it’s the interplay between Davies and Smith that makes this really special." [...] Scotland on Sundays Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series' return, alongside The Royle Family, Blackadder and Shooting Stars—other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials. Ramaswamy wrote: [...] "all the comforting, well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> {{is becoming more and more}} risk-averse, it's the oldies but goodies that we trust." [...] Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury also considered this nostalgia angle, but concluded that: [...] "Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you’re happy to see once a year – any more than that, you feel, and his mannerisms would start to grate." [...] She deemed the episode: [...] "Less a blast from the past as a shuffling [...] "excuse me". Conversely, Anne Pickles for the News and Star wrote that a one-off special was not enough, and [...] "what we really wanted was a brand new series". Pickles said of the episode: [...] "It’s the gentle, facially expressive, deeply sceptical, somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek that makes this sleuthing drama such a glory. But a one-off? Oh come on... you can do better than that." ...|$|E

5000|$|On {{the topic}} of child sexuality, Savage has said: We live <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>that's</b> hysterical about {{children}} and assumes they have no sexual agency or desire. But anyone who can remember what they were like when they were 11 knows that kids are sexual, and whether it was messing around with their cousin, playing doctor with their neighbor, or making passes at people 10 years older, they were horny. So NAMBLA steps out to articulate all this, albeit in its usual highly dysfunctional and creepy way, and because we {{know what they say}} to be true on this issue, we've got to label them as insane perverts. Any attempt at rational discussion about youth sexuality and intergenerational sex is simply shouted down.|$|R

2500|$|The {{mental and}} sexual {{health effects of}} {{biphobia}} on bisexual people are numerous. Studies show that bisexuals are often trapped in between the binaries of heterosexuality and homosexuality, creating a form of invalidation around their sexual identity.

These indicators and pressures to [...] "choose" [...] a sexual identity can, in many cases, lead to depression as they may feel they live <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> does not recognize their existence.|$|E

2500|$|Even if {{artists that}} engage in gender dress [...] "rule breaking" [...] {{are doing so}} without much thought and for their own comfort, such as A$AP Rocky, their actions are still political.

A man wearing a dress <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> links this garb with women might be labeled different, an outsider to the community, or someone resisting the social order of things. [...] Gender is a “social construct” and is fluid, constantly changing with the morals and values of a society. [...] For people with a large platform such as rap artists this type of behavior can have positive affects in society for accepting differences in individuals and breaking the stigma of homophobia found in hip hop.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the growing}} number of {{international}} business, military placements, and immigration there has been a growing number of TCKs. Third culture kids are being educated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> is not their own. Schools and teachers {{need to be aware of}} the culture differences these students face. Studies have found that educators and counselors should be culturally competent and possess the knowledge to properly educate these type of students. This would create an effective and optimal environment for their learning and adjusting abilities. Research conducted on TCKs have [...] been found to need special attention during their transition phase. The stress and grief students feel during transitional phases can distort their psycho-social development which can affect their grades and school work. Therefore, Third Culture Kid students need a comfortable and inviting school setting to offset the effect of their transition. The best way for counselors to work with TCKs is to have sound knowledge about the students and their unique characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|In a blog post, he {{expanded}} on this, {{discussing the}} film's symbolism, imagery and Trier's intentions, calling him [...] "one {{of the most}} heroic directors in the world" [...] and Antichrist [...] "a powerfully-made film that contains material many audiences will find repulsive or unbearable. The performances by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg are heroic and fearless. Trier's visual command is striking. The use of music is evocative; no score, but operatic and liturgical arias. And if you can think beyond what he shows to what he implies, its depth are [...] frightening." [...] Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel called Antichrist [...] "Trier's most visually lush and technically rigorous film; it captures things at a molecular level and in a slow motion that all but brings the world to a halt... But paradoxically, this is his most unwatchable film, and many will find its violence and cruelty, including scenes of genital mutilation, repellent. I cannot recommend Antichrist, but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> hemorrhages death and torture nightly on shows like 24 or , I can understand it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Military law {{requires}} commanding officers {{and those in}} authority to demonstrate virtue, honor, patriotism, and subordination in all that they do. In the 1990s, the army officially adopted what {{have come to be}} known as [...] "The 7 Army Values", which are summarized with the acronym [...] "LDRSHIP". LDRSHIP stands for Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage. While this acronym is relatively new, the ideas it represents have been at the heart of military service for generations. Similarly, the motto [...] "Duty, honor, country" [...] is the standard of the U.S. military. Military brats are raised <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> stresses LDRSHIP, Duty, Honor, and Country. Their strict (outward) adherence to military values is what separates most from their civilian peers. Children of military personnel often mirror the values, ideals, and attitudes of their parents more than children of civilians. Marine General Peter Pace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a 2006 interview, [...] "There's no way, in my mind, that you can be successful in the military and have a family unless that family does, in fact, appreciate your service to the country."
