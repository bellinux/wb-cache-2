5|$|Pelat {{had been}} a friend of François Mitterrand, then President of France, and at the centre of a scandal {{involving}} French Prime Minister Pierre Bérégovoy. As an investigative judge, Jean-Pierre could not dismiss any information brought to his attention pertaining to the case, especially <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> {{have led to a}} scandal similar to the one implicating an illegal Masonic lodge named Propaganda Due in the 1982 Banco Ambrosiano bank failure in Italy, Jean-Pierre ordered a search of Plantard's home. The search turned up a hoard of false documents, including some proclaiming Plantard the true king of France. Plantard admitted under oath that he had fabricated everything, including Pelat's involvement with the Priory of Sion. Plantard was threatened with legal action by the Pelat family and therefore disappeared to his house in southern France. He was 74 years old at the time. Nothing more was heard of him until he died in Paris on 3 February 2000.|$|E

Robert, a miserable gentle giant, jealous of his younger sibling's position as favorite son and also of the success his brother has achieved both professionally and personally, is Ray's biggest rival. Robert and Raymond frequently argue like overgrown children, focusing much of their energy on picking on or one upping each other, although deep down they love each other dearly.|$|E

25|$|The {{next two}} decades were a time of steady growth and {{prestige}} for Alpha Epsilon Pi, {{as well as other}} fraternities. Expansion was occurring at an incredible rate for the Greek system as a whole. However, with the onset of fighting in Vietnam in the early 1960s, fraternity life faltered. Liberal student bodies revolted against authority and the Greek system, which was seen as a conservative, elitist group. Membership plummeted and nearly half the chapter roll was lost. It almost looked as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been the end for Alpha Epsilon Pi. However the fraternity was able to reverse the trend and stabilize following the Vietnam War.|$|E

25|$|Toward {{the close}} of a September day in the year 1864, a crowd of {{students}} was collected on the Bowdoin campus near the Thorndike oak. Each class was not only represented, but present almost in its entirety; still, as the college at that time bore upon its rolls only about a hundred names, the reader is not to imagine the assembly as one of remarkable proportions. The several classes, without being grouped as separate bodies, were in a measure distinct, as if their members were drawn together by community of sentiment or interest. The center, of the throng was composed mainly of Sophomores who, to the melody of tin horns, devil's fiddles and watchmen's rattles, {{from time to time}} added vocal effects scarcely less loud and discordant. Next to them stood the open-eyed Freshmen, eagerly appreciative of the novelty of the scene; while most of the upper-class men were ranged along the outer edge or a little apart, and were endeavoring to preserve looks and attitudes of aloofness and indifference. The object of attraction appeared to be a tall, spare man who was standing upon a rude plank-and-barrel rostrum, and, whenever the uproar would permit, launching his remarks in a violent manner at the bystanders. He was apparently some sixty years of age. His head was uncovered, showing his hair thin and streaked with gray. His face was smooth except for a stubbly two days' growth of beard, and was wrinkled and browned by exposure to the weather. Beside him upon the platform rested a dilapidated silk hat which, as well as his suit of rusty black, looked as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been discarded some years before by its former owner. They were not, however, incongruous {{with the rest of his}} attire, since both his dickey above and his shirt below his black stock bore the same signs of poverty and neglect.|$|E

[...] "Maybe", replied Passer, [...] "but it still needs one more thing – a billiards table." [...] The trio had a passion for billiards and felt that they could make a success of even the weakest idea if they had ready access to a table. Having found a good one at Dobříš Castle, the three, along with Václav Sasek, wrote a {{screenplay}} that fleshed out Forman's encounter with the young woman from Varnsdorf.|$|E
500|$|Like James, Anne later {{supported}} a Catholic match for both their sons, and her correspondence {{with the potential}} bride, the Spanish Infanta, Maria Anna, included a request that two friars be sent to Jerusalem to pray for her and the King. The papacy itself was never quite sure where Anne stood; in 1612, Pope Paul V advised a nuncio: [...] "Not considering the inconstancy of that Queen and the many changes she had made in religious matters and that even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be true {{that she might be}} a Catholic, one should not take on oneself any judgement." ...|$|E
500|$|The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{has been}} {{moderately}} well received by critics. Writing for Common Sense Media, Melissa Camacho spoke favorably of the series' emphasis on [...] "a successful and powerful {{segment of the}} African-American community" [...] {{that appears to be}} frequently neglected by the popular television. Tim Hall from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer commented of his general distaste for reality television, particularly describing The Real Housewives of Orange County as [...] "utterly ridiculous". However, he admitted that the dynamic and conflict between the women, in addition to the wealthy lifestyles they led, to be [...] "somewhat entertaining". In a more mixed review, Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times joked that its portrayal of wealth served as [...] "the best choice for a time capsule of the Bling Decade" [...] when noting the economic downturn the United States experienced around the time that the series premiered, although more seriously stated that the housewives' luxuries [...] "was never all that enviable, and now it looks as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> not be viable." [...] Hanh Nguyen from Zap2It shared a similar sentiment, criticizing that the [...] "showy elite and rampant consumerism" [...] that the women regularly display [...] "seems rather out of touch" [...] given the United States' economic hardship, although she elaborated that the program [...] " [...] not by any means boring, but you do {{have to be in the}} mood to watch." ...|$|E

500|$|Peck {{and other}} {{commission}} members were {{not satisfied with}} the design proposals, and suggested some of their own. [...] Barber denigrated these in a letter to Roberts on June 8. [...] Peck had proposed that only the faces of Washington and Lafayette be shown, with no depiction {{of the rest of the}} head. [...] Barber stated, [...] "I am of the opinion that the heads of Washington and Lafayette should be treated from the sculptor's standpoint, and every effort be made to represent them with a grandeur and dignity commensurate with the position they fill in the Nation's history, which certainly could not be done if they are to be shown peeping out of a half moon." [...] At the instructions of Roberts, Barber went to New York and met with Peck over two days on June 14 and 15. Afterwards, Barber reported to the Mint Director, [...] "I think we will hear no more of the Lafayette prayer" [...] and that Peck now appreciated that the space available for a design, even on a silver dollar (the largest US coin) was limited, [...] "and as it is the desire of the Committee [...] to have the monument displayed, the prayer will have to find some other place". Although Barber indicated that the decision of the commission to represent the statue without its pedestal represented progress toward the point where he might engrave dies, [...] "I learned in New York that the work of the sculptor must be submitted to a committee in Paris who will have entire charge of the monument, and the sculptor's work has to be changed in any and every detail until it meets the approval of this Committee of Frenchmen... to me it looks as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be sometime in 1900." ...|$|E

After the expedition returned in 1836, the anatomist Richard Owen confirmed the tooth was from an extinct species, which he subsequently named Equus curvidens, and remarked, [...] "This evidence of the former existence of a genus, which, as regards South America, had become extinct, and has a second time been introduced into that Continent, {{is not one of}} the least interesting fruits of Mr. Darwin's palæontological discoveries." ...|$|E

Realizing that an epidemic was imminent, that same evening, Welch called Mayor George Maynard to arrange an emergency town council meeting. The council immediately implemented a quarantine.

2500|$|Some {{medications}} {{are also}} given by IV [...] "push" [...] or bolus. A syringe containing the medication {{is connected to}} an access port in the primary tubing and the medication is administered through the port. The syringe plunger is pressed slowly, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> irritate the vein or cause a too-rapid effect. Certain medications, such as potassium, are never to be administered by IV push because the spike in medication in the blood from the IV push could be fatal. Once a medicine has been injected into the fluid stream of the IV tubing {{there must be some}} means of ensuring that it gets from the tubing to the patient. [...] Usually this is accomplished by allowing the fluid stream to flow normally and thereby carry the medicine into the bloodstream; however, a second fluid injection is sometimes used, a [...] "flush", following the injection to push the medicine into the bloodstream more quickly.|$|E
