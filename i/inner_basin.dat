However, while the threat from RAF bombers in daylight had now gone, Bomber Command was soon making night bombing attacks on Kiel’s port. Gneisenau was moved into an <b>inner</b> <b>basin</b> alongside her depot ship, Monte Olivia. The hatches were left open and her tanks, still containing a large amount of fuel, were left unattended. RAF Bomber Command made its first attack {{on the night of the}} 25/26 February, when 61 bombers flew over Kiel. Monte Olivia was destroyed but Gneisenau escaped. On 26/27 February another 61 RAF bombers returned. A bomb penetrated Gneisenaus foredeck and exploded. The oil fumes from the tanks ignited and the ship was engulfed in fire from her bow to the Anton turret. The entire forward part of the bow needed to be replaced. She steamed to Gdynia, in Poland on 4 April where she was decommissioned out of range of RAF bombers. Gneisenau did not put to sea again. The raid cost three aircraft, one Hampton and two Wellingtons. German casualties amounted to 16 civilians and 116 sailors dead.|$|E

60|$|Leaving this gifted {{favourite}} {{of fortune}} and nature, we shall pass to {{an entirely different}} individual, and to another quarter of the place. The spot, to which we wish now to transport the reader, was neither more nor less than the shop of a tailor, who did not disdain to perform the most minute offices of his vocation in his own heedful person. The humble edifice stood at no great distance from the water, in the skirts of the town, and {{in such a situation}} as to enable its occupant to look out upon the loveliness of the <b>inner</b> <b>basin,</b> and, through a vista cut by the element between islands, even upon the lake-like scenery of the outer harbour. A small, though little frequented wharf lay before his door, while a certain air of negligence, and the absence of bustle, sufficiently manifested that the place itself was not the immediate site of the much-boasted commercial prosperity of the port.|$|E
60|$|The {{next step}} was to find the {{southern}} end of the outer ledge that formed the succeeding passage. This was not done until the ship was close aboard of it. A change had come over the spot within the last few hours, in consequence of the increase of wind, the water breaking all along the ledge, instead of on its end only; but Mark cared not for this, once certain he had found that end. He was now half-way between his former anchorage and the crater, and he could distinguish the latter quite plainly. But sail was necessary to carry the ship safely through the channel ahead, and Mark called to Bob to lash the helm a-midships after luffing up to his course, and to spring to the main-topmast staysail halliards, and help him hoist the sail. This was soon done, and the new sail was got up, and the sheet hauled aft. Next followed the mizen staysail, which was spread in the same manner. Bob then flew to the wheel, and Mark to his knight-heads again. Contrary to Mark's apprehensions, he saw that the ship was luffing up close to the weather ledge, leaving little danger of her going on to it. As soon as met by the helm, however, she fell off, and Mark no longer had any doubt of weathering the northern end of the inner ledge of this passage. The wind coming in fresher puffs, this was soon done, when the ship was kept dead away for the crater. There was the northern end of the reef, which formed the <b>inner</b> <b>basin</b> of all, to double, when that which remained to do was merely to range far enough within the reef to get a cover, and to drop the anchor. In order to do this with success, Mark now commenced hauling down the jib. By the time he had that sail well in, the ship was off the end of the sunken reef, when Bob put his helm a-starboard and rounded it. Down came the main-topmast staysail, and Mark jumped on the forecastle, while he called out to Bob to lash the helm a-lee. In an instant Bob was at the young man's side, and both waited for the ship to luff into the wind, and to forge as near as possible to the reef. This was successfully done also, and Mark let go the stopper within twenty feet of the wall of the sunken reef, just as the ship began to drive astern. The canvas was rolled up and secured, the cable payed out, until the ship lay just mid-channel between the island and the sea-wall without, and the whole secured. Then Bob took off his tarpaulin and gave three cheers, while Mark walked aft, silently returning thanks to God for the complete success of this important movement.|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} {{disappearance of}} the Arctic summer sea ice and its time are currently discussed among climate researchers {{in view of the}} rapid decrease of the summer sea-ice cover in recent years. Whether this decrease represents a climate change signal caused by anthropogenic influence or an extreme manifestation of internal climate variabilityis still unclear. By means of a 20 -year simulation of a coupled regional pan-Arctic atmosphere-ocean-ice model for the 1980 s and 1990 s and comparison of the model results with SSM/I satellite-derived sea-ice concentrations, the patterns of maximum amplitude of interannual variability of the Arctic summer sea-ice cover are revealed. They are shown to concentrate beyond an area enclosed by an isopleth of barotropic planetary potential vorticity that marks the edge of the cyclonic rim current around the deep <b>inner</b> Arctic <b>basin.</b> It is argued that the propagation of the interannual variability signal farther into the <b>inner</b> Arctic <b>basin</b> is likely to be possible owing to changes in the oceanic circulation. Such changes could be jointly responsible for the exceptionally strong decrease of the summer sea-ice cover during the last years when sea-ice decay waspromoted by anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns...|$|R
40|$|The lithostratigraphy of the Great Estuarine Group is revised by {{reference}} to defined type sections of the eight formations (joint publication with J. D. Hudson). Within this framework a series of lagoonal delta and lagoon shoreline depositional models are proposed for the two sandstone dominated formations (Elgol and Valtos). Sedimentation was controlled by brackish, widely fluctuating and locally marine salinities in two elongate <b>basins</b> (<b>Inner</b> Hebrides and Sea of the Hebrides) separated by a slowly subsiding ridge termed the mid-Skye palaeohigh. Low sinuosity rivers of rapidly fluctuating discharge supplied the deltas with sand sourced from the Moinian and Dalradian (probably via the ORS) of the Scottish landmass {{to the east and}} tram the Lewisian of the Outer Hebrides landmass to the west. The Elgol Formation represents a fluvial-wave-tide interaction delta in the north of the Sea of the Hebrides Basin Where salinities were marine and shows a southwards transition to a fluvial dominated delta with buoyant mouth bar dynamics. In the <b>Inner</b> Hebrides <b>Basin</b> it represents a fluvially dominated lobate delta system with fresh-brackish salinities controlling friction dominated mouth bar hydrodynamics. The Valtos Formation in the Sea of the Hebrides Basin represents 8 phases of fluvial-wave interaction delta progradation separated by transgressive shell debris beds. The deltas pass laterally into interdeltaic lagoon shorelines and part of the formation represents offshore shell debris sheets and shoals. In the smaller <b>Inner</b> Hebrides <b>Basin</b> the formation represents 6 fluvially dominated lobate delta progradation phases with only minor wave reworking. The identification of genetic relationships between facies allows correlation and the prediction of sand body geometry while the recognition of the overall control of contemporary subsidence rates allows palaeogeographic reconstruction...|$|R

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to define the role of various sources of recharge in the surficial alluvial aquifer system in arid Alice Springs in central Australia, for future {{management of water resources}} in the region. Multiple sources of natural recharge include infiltration from ephemeral stream flow in the Todd River; groundwater throughflow between connected alluvial basins; regional groundwater flow from the underlying Tertiary aquifer; and diffuse recharge. In addition treatment, storage and irrigation reuse of Alice Springs' waste water has resulted in additional recharge of effluent, via infiltration. Water resource management plans for the region include effluent reuse through Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) within one of the connected alluvial basins, with the purpose of managing the excess waste water overflows while also supplementing groundwater resources for irrigation and protecting their quality. Hydrogeochemical tracers, chloride and the stable isotopes of water, were used in a three-member mixing model to define and quantify the major recharge sources. The mixing model was not sensitive enough to quantify minor contributions from effluent in groundwater that were identified only by an evaporated isotopic signature. The contribution of the multiple recharge sources varied spatially with proximity to the recharge source; with Todd River, effluent and Town Basin throughflow contributing to the <b>Inner</b> Farm <b>Basin</b> groundwater. The Outer Farm Basin was largely influenced by the Todd River, the <b>Inner</b> Farm <b>Basin</b> throughflow and the older Tertiary aquifer. While Inner Farm groundwater throughflow contains an effluent component, only Outer Farm Basin groundwater near the interface between the two basins clearly illustrated an effluent signature. Aside from this, effluent recharge was not evident in the Outer Farm Basin, indicating that past unmanaged recharge practices will not mask signs of Managed Aquifer Recharge through the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) operation. The long-term impact of effluent recharge is a shift from sodium and calcium as co-dominant cations in the groundwater, as evident in the Outer Farm Basin, to dominance by sodium alone, as typical for the <b>Inner</b> Farm <b>Basin...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{impacts of}} tides on extreme tsunami {{propagation}} due to potential Nankai Trough earthquakes in the Seto Inland Sea (SIS), Japan, are investigated through numerical experiments. Tsunami experiments are conducted based on five scenarios that consider tides at 4 different phases, such as flood, high, ebb, and low tides. The probes that were selected arbitrarily in the Bungo and Kii Channels show less significant effects of tides on tsunami heights {{and the arrival}} times of the first waves than those that experience large tidal ranges in <b>inner</b> <b>basins</b> and bays of the SIS. For instance, the maximum tsunami height and the arrival time at Toyomaesi differ by more than 0. 5 m and nearly 1 hr, respectively, depending on the tidal phase. The uncertainties {{defined in terms of}} calculated maximum tsunami heights due to tides illustrate that the calculated maximum tsunami heights in the inner SIS with standing tides have much larger uncertainties than those of two channels with propagating tides. Particularly in Harima Nada, the uncertainties due to the impacts of tides are greater than 50 % of the tsunami heights without tidal interaction. The results recommend to simulate tsunamis together with tides in shallow water environments to reduce the uncertainties involved with tsunami modeling and predictions for tsunami hazards preparedness...|$|R
