5000|$|Contreras {{explains}} that American Securit Co. v. Shatterproof Glass Corp. is a notable case {{because it is}} the first decision to address the consequences of a patent holder’s violation of the terms of a court-imposed compulsory patent licensing decree. In 1948, a district court entered a consent decree establishing that Securit and other glass-manufacturer defendants violated the Sherman Act by conspiring to exploit patents covering technology for tempering <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> in a restrictive manner. The defendants were ordered to grant to any applicant a non-exclusive license under their patents and to refrain from including any restrictions or conditions in that license. The consent decree included a prohibition against requiring a licensee to take a license under any patent not covered by the decree. Shatterproof Glass requested a license from Securit in 1951 for a license under some patents covered in the consent decree. Securit refused to grant Shatterproof a license unless it agreed to license a larger portfolio of patents that included patents not covered in the decree, at a single, fixed royalty rate—a so-called package license. After inconclusive negotiations, Shatterproof began to manufacture glass in a manner allegedly covered by Securit’s patents. Securit then sued Shatterproof for patent infringement. Shatterproof raised as defenses patent misuse and Securit's violation of the consent order, which expressly prohibited Securit's package-licensing demand. The district court in Delaware ruled for Shatterproof on both grounds and barred Securit from enforcing its patents against Shatterproof, and the Third Circuit affirmed. Securit argued to the district court that the package license was its standard form of license and deviating from that standard offering would discriminate against Securit’s existing licensees. The district court rejected the argument, saying that obey the consent decree. Contreras states that this is [...] "the first example of patents being rendered unenforceable {{as a result of the}} violation of a court-imposed patent licensing commitment." ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the enhanced surfaces in such applications as boiling heat transfer. The testing measurement module with enhanced heating surfaces was used for pool boiling research. Pool boiling experiments were conducted with distilled water at atmospheric pressure in the vessel using an enhanced sample as the bottom heating surface. The samples are soldered to a copper heating block of the round cross-section. They were placed: in the fluid (saturation temperature measurement), under the sample for temperature determination. A vessel made of four <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> was used for visualization. The heated surfaces in contact with the fluid differed in roughness were smooth or enhanced. This paper analyzes the effects of the microstructured heated surface on the heat transfer coefficient. The results are presented as relationships between the heat transfer coefficient and the heat flux and as boiling curves. The experimental data obtained for the two types of enhanced heated surfaces was compared with the results recorded for the smooth heated surface. The highest local values of the heat transfer coefficient were reported for the enhanced surfaces...|$|E
40|$|The major {{problems}} of today, e. g. the shortages of certain raw materials, {{the increase in}} energy costs and growing environmental pollution, have led to fresh applications of physical vapour deposition (PVD) techniques.

40|$|Glass {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{important}} evidence submitted to forensic laboratories for analysis. It is frequently encountered at crime scenes, particularly those involving motor vehicle accidents or burglaries. This study emphasized on the examination of the fracture patterns performed on different types of <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> after broken by different type of impact objects, analysis of fracture features to determine direction of force and identifying of refractive index of glass as further analysis. Three types of <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> (float, tempered and laminated) and four levels of breaking devices (hammer, bat, golf ball and stone either by throwing or using catapult) were used in the experiment. The results show that almost the whole float <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> were shatters into sharp glass pieces after broken by all type of breaking devices. Then, tempered <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> was broken with the whole <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> shatters into small pieces of blunt granules when only hammer exerted on the glass, meanwhile, for other breaking devices were caused a scratch marks on glass surface. For laminated glass when broken by bat, throwing a stone and using catapult, almost the whole of <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> were remains intact on its interlayer film and got some splinters from point of impact were flying out. Meanwhile, fracture patterns on laminated <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> when broken by hammer produced a cone or crater after striking. However, impact objects used to break those types of <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are not really reliable to be distinguished. This is because the fracture patterns on <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> obviously differ by its types of glass only. When a <b>pane</b> of <b>glass</b> is broken by an impact, majority of the broken fragments will fall in the direction of the force, which is on the side of the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> opposite direction of the application of force. A determination of the direction of force in breaking a <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> can be determined by the direction of the rib marks. As the impact occurs, concentric fractures form around the impact and interconnect with radial cracks to form triangular pieces. The edge of each triangular piece has visible stress lines that describe the direction of the blow. The refractive index of each type of glass was determined by GRIM 3 equipment which produce results of refractive index for float <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are about 1. 5200; tempered <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are about 1. 5181 and, laminated <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are about 1. 5188...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{steel is}} a {{material}} {{that allows for}} slender columns. However, slender steel columns usually have a low load bearing resistance due to flexural buckling. It is possible to suppress flexural column buckling by adding <b>glass</b> <b>panes.</b> Thus, use can {{be made of the}} steel section’s squash load reducing the amount of steel involved and obtaining a highly transparent glasssteel column. In this paper, a new type of slender transparent glass-steel column is proposed, consisting of a high strength steel bar supported in lateral direction by <b>glass</b> <b>panes.</b> Its feasibility is shown experimentally and numerically. It is also shown that the design has sufficient redundancy to allow for the loss of supporting <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> without a reduction of the load bearing capacity. The key design feature of this glass-steel column is the way the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are connected to the steel bar, namely by sliding steel sleeves to avoid direct stresses to occur in the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> due to axial column deformation...|$|R
40|$|The author {{discusses}} {{the use of}} <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> as transparent stability elements in vertical façade structures subjected to in-plane loads including temperature loads. In the present façade architecture, glass is normally used non-structural. The only mechanical requirement is to resist transversal loads, which determines {{the thickness of the}} <b>glass</b> <b>pane.</b> Thus, <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are not used to stabilize the structural system. However, <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> have excellent in-plane stiffness qualities, and providing appropriate connections between glass and the supporting structure, this in-plane stiffness can possibly attribute to the building’s stability. Temperature loads on the glass avoid making a totally stiff connection between glass and structure, whereas this would be required for the stability aspect. To investigate this problem, this paper presents two conceptual connection designs between glass and structure. For temperature loads, these connections will be studied using the theory of plates. It is shown that a bond line as connection, having a large stiffness directly leads to a uniformly distribution equal to almost the complete temperature load. If the shear stiffness of the bond line is taken into account, a complex stress pattern in the <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> occurs, even for a geometrical and physical linear approach. Thus, the impact of the temperature loads is significant for all <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> (plate level) and is independent on façade size and this in contrast with the collaboration of the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> and supporting structure to resist laterally mechanical loads (structure level). Research will continue with experiments to verify the theoretical derived results and with the development of finite element models to study the complex stress pattern in the <b>glass</b> <b>pane,</b> dependent on connection type and load case...|$|R

A system, built up of a steel frame, a single <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> and a flexible {{adhesive bonded}} joint across the full thickness of the <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> was subjected to a concentrated horizontal in-plane load at the top. Experiments with square <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> sizes showed that the system had a very small inplane stiffness, a glass-steel contact at large horizontal in-plane loads and a good residual capacity. The parametric studies by means of finite element models only focused on the variation of the geometry of the <b>glass</b> <b>pane.</b> The behaviour of the system mainly depends on the stiffness of the adhesive bonded joint. At larger horizontal in-plane displacements, systems with rectangular <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> sizes have two glass-steel contacts. The mechanic models well predict the in-plane stiffness of the system, the largest maximum principle stress and the maximum normal and shear stresses in the adhesive bonded joint. The horizontal in-plane load and the horizontal in-plane displacement at the top at the first glass-steel contact are also well predicted. The criteria are the limitation of the horizontal in-plane displacement at the top (serviceability) or the strain rate of the adhesive bonded joint (strength).

40|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>panes</b> {{structurally}} {{bonded to}} a steel framework {{can be used}} as a stability system for buildings. A system built up of a single <b>glass</b> <b>pane,</b> a steel frame and a glued joint is only loaded by a concentrated monotonic in-plane load at the top. Three glued joint types are defined, namely a flexible joint on the end, a two-sided and a one-sided rigid joint. A finite element model was developed and calibrated with the experiments followed by varying the geometry of the <b>glass</b> <b>pane.</b> The applied criteria are the strength of glass for failure and the restricted in-plane displacement at the top. The system with a flexible joint on the end can be characterized by small loads, large inplane displacements and small stiffnesses. The stiffness is the criterion. Systems with two-sided and one sided rigid joints can be characterized by larger loads, much smaller,in-plane displacements and larger stiffnesses. The strength of glass is the criterion and is located on the <b>glass</b> <b>pane's</b> surface in the vicinity of the glued joint which anchors the tensile diagonal of the <b>glass</b> <b>pane.</b> These tensile stresses increase by the different in stiffness of the glued joint (rigid) and the less shear stiffness of the bolts between beadwork and outside beam of the frame. However, the stress distribution in the <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> as well as in the glued joint is unfavourable for systems with one-sided rigid joint.

40|$|Modern {{architecture}} requires {{transparent and}} slender structural elements for columns. Structural steel is a material {{that allows for}} slender columns. However, flexural buckling is usually the dominant failure mode of such columns. If flexural buckling can be suppressed, the full yield stress of the steel may be utilized. It would then make sense to use high-strength steel. In this work, a slender transparent glass-supported high-strength steel column was designed, tested and numerically analysed. It consisted of a 32 mm diameter Dywidag steel bar restrained against flexural buckling by four heat-strengthened float <b>glass</b> <b>panes,</b> thus providing sufficient redundancy, allowing for a <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> to break without column failure. The <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> were connected to the steel bar by vertically sliding steel sleeves avoiding normal stresses caused by axial column deformation occurring in the <b>glass</b> <b>panes.</b> The column was one storey high with slightly shorter <b>glass</b> <b>panes,</b> keeping them free from the roof and the floor.
