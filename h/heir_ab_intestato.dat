5000|$|Ottone's {{final years}} were spent mostly on {{internal}} affairs, but he maintained his contacts with Asti and the emperor. Within his own fiefs, he converted the myriad obligations {{of the inhabitants}} of the towns and villages into annual rents. In November 1233 he renounced his rights at Cortemiglia to fodder and to the goods of those who died intestate (<b>ab</b> <b>intestato)</b> in exchange for an annual rent. The same exchange was made in Cairo in light of the town's [...] "weakness, vulnerability and poverty" [...] (debilitatem, passibilitatem et paupertatem).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the history of}} Latin maxims and expressions in English, Estonian and Polish legal languages {{and the influence of}} Latin on contemporary legal language and its translation. A number of maxims and expressions were examined by comparing their present meanings in those three legal systems. A selection of fifteen of them is presented in the article, namely: <b>ab</b> <b>intestato,</b> corpus iuris civilis, error iuris, fraus est celerem fraudem, ignorantia iuris neminem excusat, impossibilium nulla est obligatio, inter arma silent leges, ipso iure, lex non scripta, pacta sunt servanda, qui tacet – consentire videtur, restitutio in integrum,m sub iudice, and summum ius summa iniuria. The term Actio Pauliana which is used in the bankruptcy law is used here to show how translators may use Latin terms in order to find proper translation equivalents. Finally, the authors point out the differences in pronunciation and spelling of Latin maxims and expressions in English, Estonian and Polish...|$|R

A succession struggle broke out immediately as other pretenders quickly emerged.|$|R
2500|$|In 1146 news reached Owain {{that his}} favoured eldest son and <b>heir,</b> Rhun <b>ab</b> Owain Gwynedd, died. Owain was {{overcome}} with grief, {{falling into a}} deep depression from which none could console him, until news reached him that Mold Castle in Tengeingl had fallen to Gwynedd, [...] " [...] that he had still a country for which to live," [...] wrote historian Sir John Edward Lloyd.|$|R
50|$|The novel {{follows the}} {{exploits}} of the Snopes family, beginning with Ab Snopes, who is introduced more fully in Faulkner's The Unvanquished. Most of the book centers on Frenchman's Bend, into which the <b>heirs</b> of <b>Ab</b> {{and his family have}} migrated from parts unknown. In the beginning of the book Ab, his wife, daughter, and son Flem settle down as tenant farmers beholden to the powerful Varner family.|$|R
60|$|It is {{probable}} that few persons who proclaim their belief in miracles have considered what {{would be necessary to}} justify that belief {{in the case of a}} professed modern miracle-worker. Suppose, for example, it is affirmed that A.B. died and that C.D. brought him to life again. Let it be granted that A.B. and C.D. are persons of unimpeachable honour and veracity; that C.D. is the next <b>heir</b> to <b>A.B.'s</b> estate, and therefore had a strong motive for not bringing him to life again; and that all A.B.'s relations, respectable persons who bore him a strong affection, or had otherwise an interest in his being alive, declared that they saw him die. Furthermore, let A.B. be seen after his recovery by all his friends and neighbours, and let his and their depositions, that he is now alive, be taken down before a magistrate of known integrity and acuteness: would all this constitute even presumptive evidence that C.D. had worked a miracle? Unquestionably not. For the most important link in the whole chain of evidence is wanting, and that is the proof that A.B. was really dead. The evidence of ordinary observers on such a point as this is absolutely worthless. And, even medical evidence, unless the physician is a person of unusual knowledge and skill, may have little more value. Unless careful thermometric observation proves that the temperature has sunk below a certain point; unless the cadaveric stiffening of the muscles has become well established; all the ordinary signs of death may be fallacious, and the intervention of C.D. may have had no more to do with A.B.'s restoration to life than any other fortuitously coincident event.|$|R
