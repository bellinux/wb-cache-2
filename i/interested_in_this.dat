5|$|First of all, {{this was}} the 60th {{homicide}} in Newark this year, and I'm sure Congressman Tancredo has not opined {{about any of the}} other homicides, and only became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> one {{when it became clear that}} one of the six alleged perpetrators came to this country illegally at the age of 11. That's one thing.|$|E
5|$|To {{fund the}} new project, Roberts sold 15% of MITS to fellow Air Force officer, Lieutenant William Yates. He also got an {{investment}} from another Weapons Laboratory officer, Major Ed Laughlin. Several other officers and {{scientist at the}} lab were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{state of the art}} calculator kit and helped with the design. Forrest Mims wrote the assembly manual in return for a calculator kit.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Resurrection was planned as Joss Whedon had written an earth-set script for Alien 5, though Sigourney Weaver was not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> setting, but has {{remained}} open to reprise {{her role as}} Ellen Ripley for a fifth installment {{on the condition that}} she likes the story. Although more sequels were planned to follow Resurrection, the series became a prequel series with the 2012 film Prometheus directed by Ridley Scott, who stated that the film precedes the story of Alien, but is not directly connected to the original film's franchise, and that Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Clottey fight, {{negotiations}} began {{to pursue a}} contest against Manny Pacquiao (49-3-2, 38 KOs). Even before Pacquiao defeated Ricky Hatton, Bob Arum, who represents both Cotto and Pacquiao, stated that he was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> matchup. Subsequently, Pacquiao expressed interest in fighting Cotto. The fight was sanctioned as a world title fight in the welterweight division, where the weight limit is 147 pounds, however Cotto's camp agreed to fight at a catchweight of 145 pounds to accommodate Pacquiao's smaller physique. Cotto's camp also conceded the {{larger share of the}} purse to Pacquiao, who received a 65% share of pay-per-view buys, compared to Cotto's 35% share.|$|E
5|$|Mirror {{symmetry}} {{was originally}} discovered by physicists. Mathematicians became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> relationship around 1990 when Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes {{showed that it}} {{could be used as a}} tool in enumerative geometry, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the number of solutions to geometric questions. Candelas and his collaborators showed that mirror symmetry could be used to count rational curves on a Calabi–Yau manifold, thus solving a longstanding problem. Although the original approach to mirror symmetry was based on physical ideas that were not understood in a mathematically precise way, some of its mathematical predictions have since been proven rigorously.|$|E
5|$|Sand art is {{a special}} art form that is created on the beaches of Puri. The art form is {{attributed}} to Balaram Das, a poet {{who lived in the}} 14th century. Sculptures of various gods and famous people are now created in sand by amateur artists. These are temporary in nature as they get washed away by waves. This art form has gained international fame in recent years. One of the famed sand artists of Odisha is Sudarshan Patnaik. He established the Golden Sand Art Institute in 1995, in the open air on the shores of Bay of Bengal, to provide training to students <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> art form.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the festival Cosima received a long, critical memorandum from an unknown observer, which highlighted numerous divergences from Wagner's directions. This, says Marek, proved to be a critical factor in determining her future life's mission: the maintenance of Wagner's heritage creations through the preservation of his interpretations. In her seclusion, Cosima learned of an abortive plan masterminded by Julius Kniese, the festival's chorus-master, by which Liszt was to assume the role of music director and Bülow would be chief conductor. Neither Liszt nor Bülow was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> arrangement, and the plan died. With Groß's assistance, Cosima pre-empted any further attempts by outsiders to assume control of the Wagner legacy, by obtaining legal recognition of herself and Siegfried as sole heirs to all Wagner's property, physical and intellectual. By this means she secured an unassailable advantage over any other claim on direction of the festival's future.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Tintin and the Picaros, Hergé told the journalist Numa Sadoul that he was contemplating the next adventure of Tintin—setting an entire story in an airport lounge. This idea was dropped, and in 1978, he decided to set the story in the world of modern art. During his later years Hergé had grown increasingly <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> subject, and decided to incorporate his love of avant-garde artwork into the new story. Being a regular at Brussels' art galleries and exhibitions, he was able to draw directly upon his experiences in the art scene when producing the story. Given his age, and the length of time that it was taking him to produce each Adventure, British literary critic Michael Farr suggested that Hergé likely knew that this would be his final installment in the series.|$|E

25|$|Advances in {{nanofabrication}} {{techniques and}} concerns about energy shortage make people <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> idea. The main challenge is to increase efficiency, which is now only a few percent, compared with efficiencies of up to about 95 per cent for standard rotational electromagnetic generators.|$|E
25|$|Lathers had forthright {{remarks and}} candid {{comments}} {{in each of}} his newspapers. Because of his plainspoken approach the newspaper had enthusiastic readers <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> type of journalism. Lathers often would have one large paragraph of advertisements in the newspaper written end-to-end. Occasionally there was poetry written in the newspaper.|$|E

25|$|Reversible {{data hiding}} is a {{technique}} which enables images to be authenticated and then restored to their original form by removing the digital watermark and replacing the image data that had been overwritten. This would make the images acceptable for legal purposes. The US Army also is <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> technique for authentication of reconnaissance images.|$|E
25|$|Lake Nyasa was remote even by African standards, {{and initial}} {{progress}} with medical provision at Likoma was erratic. The programme {{had been introduced}} in 1894, during the brief stay of a UMCA physician. His replacement was the Rev John Edward Hine, who although also a medical doctor was ultimately little <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> aspect of his duties. When Hine was appointed Bishop of Eastern Equatorial Africa in 1896 he chose to concentrate on spiritual rather than health-related matters.|$|E
25|$|Khasakhala {{a rising}} Political star right from his {{inception}} into active Politics caused shockwaves in 1958 when he defeated political heavyweight, Tom Mboya to clinch {{the post of}} the Secretary of All Political Parties of Kenya. Mboya instantly became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> man and they became very close and intimate friends. Khasakhala—an innate Pan-African—joined Gikonyo Kiano, Ronald Ngala, Mboya and others travelling to Egypt and Tanzania to form the Convention of African Association, which would bring together African countries to form a united front {{in the struggle for}} independence and to promote Pan-Africanism.|$|E

25|$|Fuel cell-powered {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAV) {{include a}} Horizon fuel cell UAV {{that set the}} record distance flown for a small UAV in 2007. The military is <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> application because of its low noise, low thermal signature and ability to attain high altitude. In 2009 the Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL's) Ion Tiger utilized a hydrogen-powered fuel cell and flew for 23 hours and 17 minutes. Fuel cells are also in use to provide auxiliary power in aircraft, replacing fossil fuel generators that were previously used to start the engines and power on board electrical needs.|$|E
25|$|After {{talking to}} his contacts, {{including}} journalist friend Arthur Nabler (Jerry Adler), he tracks down Kay's man, only to find him murdered. But when he calls the police, he becomes {{a suspect in the}} man's death. The police and the FBI are also very <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case. Bernstein makes a connection with a local gangster, Sal (Stanley Tucci), uncovering a conspiracy involving a mob turf war about illegal gas rationing, and the Federal government. His activities get Sal killed and place Bernzy's life in great danger as he waits in hiding at an Italian restaurant where a mob hit is about to take place.|$|E
25|$|The Greening of Harlem Coalition {{is another}} example of an ecofeminist movement. In 1989, Bernadette Cozart founded the coalition, which is {{responsible}} for many urban gardens around Harlem. Cozart's goal is to turn vacant lots into community gardens. This is economically beneficial, and also provides a way for very urban communities {{to be in touch with}} nature and each other. The majority of people <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> project (as noted in 1990) were women. Through these gardens, they were able to participate in and become leaders of their communities. Urban greening exists in other places as well. Beginning in 1994, a group of African-American women in Detroit have developed city gardens, and call themselves the Gardening Angels. Similar garden movements have been occurring globally.|$|E
