40|$|The newly {{discovered}} Iron Workshop Account Book provides detailed records of daily management <b>expenses</b> and <b>receipts</b> for the "Quetongchang Workshop"-a small iron smelting workshop in Shicang village, Songyang county, Zhejiang province-during the year 1820. Based on examination of each {{record in the}} account book {{as well as the}} construction of a dataset, the authors of this paper carry out explicit analysis as to the following issues: the managerial operation of the workshop, {{the costs and benefits of}} iron smelting, commodity prices and labor costs, sources of capital and joint-stock patterns, and the relationship between the iron smelting industry in Shicang and the national iron market. The article argues that before the mid-nineteenth century, China had already developed a mature market system, especially with regard to industrial raw materials. The success of Shicang's iron smelting industry lay in its use of cheap labor, which enabled entrepreneurs to reduce capital investment to the lowest level. The decline of the iron industry in Shicang was most likely caused by the economic depression at the end of the Daoguang period. When the economic depression ended, foreign iron products began to saturate the Chinese market, preventing the revival of the iron smelting industry in Shicang and the southern Zhejiang region...|$|R

We performed a sequential mixed method, with the in-depth interviews in the first stage (n = 35), followed by a survey on the Flemish FADN (n = 614) in the second, to investigate the farmers' risk perception, the attitudes towards risk and the perceived usefulness of the risk management strategies.

Farmers are shown to be only slightly risk averse, rather risk neutral even. Further, our results suggest that farmers do not consider extensively studied risk management strategies such as contracts, futures and insurances, a valid option for their farm, and put more faith in internal strategies such as the debt management, the liquidity management and diversification. Last, risk management is to a substantial degree performed at the household level, rather than at the farm level, with strategies such as cutting the private expenses and the off-farm employment.
