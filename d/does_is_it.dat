40|$|Vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as {{pedestrians}} and bicyclists, {{are often}} involved in crashes with passenger cars. One {{way to prevent}} these crashes is to deploy active safety systems that support the car drivers and/or VRUs. However, to develop such systems, {{a thorough understanding of}} crash causation mechanisms is required. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify crash causation mechanisms from the perspective of the VRUs, and to explore the implications of these mechanisms for the development of active safety systems. Data originate from the European project SafetyNet, where 995 crashes were in-depth investigated using the SafetyNet Accident Causation System (SNACS). To limit the scope, this study analyzed only intersection crashes involving VRUs. A total of 56 VRU crashes were aggregated. Results suggest that, while 30 % of the VRUs did not see the conflict car due to visual obstructions in the traffic environment, 70 % of the VRUs saw the car before the collision, but still misunderstood the traffic situation and/or made an inadequate plan of action. An important implication that follows from this is that, while detection of cars is clearly an issue that needs to be addressed, it is even more important to help the VRUs to correctly understand traffic situation (e. g., does the driver intend to slow down, and if s/he <b>does,</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to let the VRU cross or for some other reason?). The former issue suggests a role for various cooperative active safety systems, as the obstacles are generally impenetrable with regular sensors. The latter issue is less straightforward. While various systems can be proposed, such as providing gap size estimation and reducing the car speed variability, the functional merits of each such a system need to be further investigated...|$|E

The goal of this work is first to introduce the issue of corporate philanthropy on the theoretical level and next to describe the local philanthropic practices in two very different cultures [...] in the Czech Republic and in Hong Kong. The data from researches carried out in these two countries were used for the analyses of the state of local philanthropy.

In what respects is the philanthropy in both countries similar and where <b>does</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> differ? Hong Kong is a country of long capitalistic tradition and is also a regional center for many multinational companies, which traditionally engage in these activities. Is this country with its culture of corporate philanthropy ahead of us and is there something we can learn from Hong Kong? Based on this comparison we can search for inspiration, possible risks and solutions. This work was elaborated using specialized bibliography focusing on the matter of corporate philanthropy. An invaluable source of information proved to be internet, mainly because philanthropy is a relatively new phenomenon in Czech Republic and there is not a large number of monographies concerning this topic.

40|$|Severe midfacial trauma {{presents}} several {{challenges to}} the reconstructive surgeon. Acute rigid fixation of the facial skeleton accompanied by bone grafting to restore the confines and volume of the orbit provide the best opportunity for acceptable aesthetic results. The severity of the trauma causes the late postoperative complication of enophthalmos. Injury to orbital structures with subsequent cicatricial change results in significant alteration in extraocular motility with resultant diplopia. There are no reports in the literature which critically evaluate the effect of late enophthalmos correction on extraocular motility, diplopia, and vision in patients who have suffered Le Fort or NOE fractures. A retrospective study is presented which reviews the results of late surgery for the correction of enophthalmos in 40 patients, {{all of whom had}} severe "impure" orbital fractures. This study addresses the following questions: (1) Can the globe effectively be repositioned?, (2) Is there a change in subjective diplopia?, (3) Does a change in extraocular motility occur, and if it <b>does,</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> predictable?, (4) Is there a risk to visual acuity? and finally, (5) Do the answers to questions 1 through 4 suggest that late surgical intervention for the correction of enophthalmos should be recommended for this patient population? During a 9 -year period, 44 patients with severe diplopia trauma received surgery for enophthalmos correction. A review of 40 patients on whom 56 operations were performed is presented. Thirty-eight patients had enophthalmos and 35 had inferior displacement of the globe. Medial displacement of the globe occurred in 11 patients. Twenty-nine patients had diplopia. Six patients had vision too poor on the injured side to have diplopia. Enophthalmos was improved in 32 patients. Dystopia of the globe was improved in 31 cases. However, neither enophthalmos nor dystopia of the globe could be improved with every operation. Only 35 of the 48 operations for enophthalmos for which measurements were available produced an improvement; in 1 case the enophthalmos was thought to be worse postoperatively. Dystopia operations resulted in improvement in 40 of 48 operations; in 2 instances dystopia was worse postoperatively. Diplopia was unchanged by 33 operations, improved by 11 procedures, and worsened by 6. If patients are considered before and after their total reconstruction course, diplopia was improved in 9 of the 29 patients. In seven of these nine, diplopia was eliminated. There was no change in or production of diplopia in 19 patients, and 5 patients had worsening of their double vision. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For this {{mathematical}} project, I am attempting to design an 8 x 8 x 8 Rubik’s cube-type puzzle. People {{around the world}} are waiting for a more challenging puzzle higher than the V-Cube 7 x 7 x 7. Erno Rubik believed that a Rubik’s cube higher than the 5 x 5 x 5 would be impossible to build because the corners {{would not be able to}} connect to the internal structure. Therefore, the Verdes family has come to construct the V-Cube 6 x 6 x 6 and 7 x 7 x 7. They plan on constructing all cubes up to the 12 x 12 x 12. However, their latest product was the V-Cube 7 x 7 x 7 and I am attempting to design an 8 x 8 x 8 Rubik’s cube-type puzzle without using the structures featured in the V-Cubes. Though the design may be complex and much more difficult to build, I feel that the project can be successfully done and add a new addition to the Rubik’s Cube group. I went about designing this by researching the flaws with the old mechanisms of previous Rubik’s Cubes. For example, if you take the structure of a standard 3 x 3 x 3 Rubik’s Cube and attempt to use it for the construction of a 8 x 8 x 8 cube, it will not work, because the center pieces would have no way of connecting to the inner mechanism. This is why cubes higher than the standard 3 x 3 x 3 Rubik’s cube need to have significant inner mechanism. For the design of the 8 x 8 x 8 cube I used the inner structure of the Rubik’s 4 x 4 x 4 along with minor adjustments. This solves the center piece problem along with the corner problem by preventing the corners form interfering with the center pieces and it holds the center pieces together while allowing them to move. While creating this project I found a very useful formula that helps to determine how many grooves are necessary for the internal structure. This allows the centers to glide with ease and not interfere with any other part of the cube. To solve the corner problem I put magnets in the pieces closest to the corner pieces and what this <b>does</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> holds the corner in place without the corner having to connect within the cube.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 This {{dissertation}} is a local, specific {{study on}} the Chamorro language policies of Guam. Scholars have noted {{since the beginning of}} the American occupation that the Indigenous Chamorro language of Guam is dying and is in danger of becoming extinct within the next generation. As the hub of American military presence in the Asia Pacific region, the island of Guam is a major site of increasing militarization. This study asked: What <b>does</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> mean that the Chamorro language of Guam is dying in the wake of increasing militarization in Guam? The objective of this study was to understand the impact of and response to militarization in Guam on Chamoru Systems of Knowledge through language policies. The threefold purpose of this study to accomplish this was: 1) to examine historical documents and research for evidence of formal and informal information policies implemented by the U. S. military on Indigenous people in Guam to understand how their existing IKS was affected; 2) to examine current formal and informal information policies to understand the existing efforts aimed at reversing the impact of historic policies; and 3) to interview individuals to understand the impact of and response to these policies on access to and flow of cultural information. The overarching question guiding this study was: What is the relationship between militarization in Guam and the flow of information within the Chamoru Indigenous Knowledge System? To address this question, the following research questions were investigated: RQ 1 : What formal and informal language policies were historically implemented in Guam under colonial rule? a. 	Who implemented these policies? b. 	How were these policies enforced? c. 	What were the intended outcomes of these policies? RQ 2 : What formal and informal language policies currently exist in Guam? a. 	Who implemented these policies? b. 	How were these policies enforced? c. 	What were the intended outcomes of these policies? RQ 3 : How has militarization affected these policies in Guam? RQ 4 : How have these policies affected the flow of information in the Indigenous Knowledge System in Guam? RQ 5 : How have the Indigenous Chamorro people responded to these policies? This dissertation is a study of language policies as information policies and the myths that shaped the beliefs, attitudes, and practices of the Chamorro people of Guåhan as expressed through stories by the Chamoru Manåmko’, or elders. Inafa’maolek, the concept of Chamorro relationality grounded this study and utilized Talking Story, the Pacific Islander method of communicating and sharing information, for data gathering...|$|E
40|$|Fax Technology Necessary for Healthcare Industry Despite the strides we {{have made}} in {{technology}} with electronic mail and other web capabilities, faxing is very much still a necessity for today’s healthcare industry. Kissimmee, FL, Friday, June 9, 2017 —Unlike what many of us thought when technology started dominating our lives, {{the need for the}} use of paper hasn’t changed that much at all. In fact, it almost seems as though there is more paper stacking up in our lives and in offices than before. Sure, paperless options are readily available for many services but there are still quite a few companies and sectors, both public and private, that {{have not been able to}} find a way to operate on a paperless system. Since fax and paper has always dominated the exchange of patient information, running on a paperless type system is especially difficult in the healthcare field. Surprising to many, paper and faxing actually accounts for about 90 % of all patient information exchanges in the healthcare world. With that in mind, it is definitely safe to assume that healthcare facilities go through countless amounts of paper. Many people believe that faxing actually saves healthcare facilities money and increases efficiency. This could not be further from the truth as paper is most likely a very high expense considering the amount of paper they use. Also, it actually takes a lot more time to send and receive faxes using outdated equipment compared to using other methods of exchanging patient information. Since faxing is considered to be much more secure for the exchange of information, the use of a fax system is still an important part of how healthcare facilities exchange sensitive patient details and information. Thanks to cloud technology there are some solutions available for sending virtual faxes without the use of a manual fax machine. However, hospitals and other similar facilities require more security than the cloud typically offers. Some facilities have deployed the use of an on-premises fax server that operates using a cloud-based transmission. This is becoming a more popular way to send and receive faxes while keeping sensitive and private details safe, but many clinics and hospitals are still using their old fax machines and are still manually handling their transmission of information. While it may take some time to integrate, cloud-based faxing is definitely the way to go if a clinic is considering cutting down on costs, both in paper and in manpower. Really, what cloud technology <b>does</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> allows us to focus our efforts on the really important aspects of running a business or facility and helps us better manage and maintain administration. Perhaps many organizations are not totally aware that faxes can be transmitted using the cloud. Cloud technology has advanced so much that we can now send a fax using Google in a matter of seconds without the need for paper or having to worry about maintaining old-school fax equipment. Now, we can literally just click and send in minutes and possibly even seconds. Hopefully all healthcare industries will transition to cloud-based faxing capabilities as the health industry continues to grow...|$|E
