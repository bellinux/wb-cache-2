40|$|Saithe (Pollachius virens) {{stocks in}} the Northeast Atlantic intermingle {{as a result of}} {{migration}} among stock areas. The extent of mi-gration has been poorly quantified. Here, we estimate measures of the migration based on existing tagging data from Icelandic, Faroese and Continental (Scotland, North Sea and Norway) waters. Saithe tagged in Icelandic waters were seldom caught outside Icelandic waters (, 1 % of tag returns), whereas 42 % of adult saithe tagged in <b>Faroese</b> <b>waters</b> were recaptured outside <b>Faroese</b> <b>waters.</b> Of adult saithe tagged in Norwegian waters 6. 6 % were recaptured outside Continental waters. In broad terms, there was a net migra-tion of saithe towards Icelandic waters. The distance between tagging and recapture increased with increasing size and age, with saithe tagged in Norwegian waters moving the longest distances. The results demonstrate significant, but variable, migration rates of adult saithe in the Northeast Atlantic. More detailed studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms behind the migration and what causes the differences among the areas...|$|E

40|$|Anglerfish Lophius piscatorius has {{during the}} last two decades become a highly {{exploited}} resource and {{is now one of the}} five most economically important demersal fish species in the Faroese fishery. Despite this, there is at present little information available on the population status of anglerfish in <b>Faroese</b> <b>waters.</b> The main aim of this study is to increase the biological knowledge of anglerfish and to perform an assessment of the stock in order to evaluate the sustainability of the anglerfish fishery and to investigate trophic interactions between anglerfish and other commercially important demersal fish species. Anglerfish illicia, the first fin ray, were used for age reading. The age determinations were validated and concluded to be useful in an age-based assessment because the growth rates were consistent with length frequency and mark-recapture analyses. Anglerfish have a very high growth rate during their first year of life, compared with the older ages. Males mature at a lower length and younger age than females. The L 50 for males and females was 58 cm and 84 cm, respectively, corresponding to an age of around four years for males and seven years for females. Observations of spawning males and females, egg-ribbons and pelagic anglerfish larvae revealed that anglerfish have a prolonged spawning season, which peaks from February to April. In addition, observations showed that there are at least two local spawning areas, one southwest of the Faroe Plateau and one in the Faroe Bank area. Large anglerfish tagged with data storage tags and conventional tags showed a seasonal offshore-onshore migration. They migrated to shallow depths in summer to feed and to deeper waters in winter, presumably to spawn. Anglerfish performed vertical movements up into the water column, and were most active in these vertical movements during the winter time and during the nights, and light intensity seemed to trigger the migrations. Anglerfish distribution was temperature dependent, since anglerfish generally preferred temperatures warmer than 4 ºC, usually between 6. 5 – 11 ºC. This may explain why anglerfish were distributed deeper west of the Faroe Bank area compared to the Faroe Plateau, which is surrounded by cold water deeper than approximately 500 m. Anglerfish in <b>Faroese</b> <b>waters</b> preyed on a variety of food items. They were generally eating fish and the most important prey species in terms of numbers were Norway pout and blue whiting, whereas cod and haddock contributed most in weight. Annual consumption by anglerfish on commercially important demersal species, such as cod, haddock and saithe, was estimated to correspond to 33, 19 and 2 % of the landings and to 75, 20 and 2 % of biomass losses due to natural mortality, respectively. Even with this high cod consumption by anglerfish, cod cannibalism and fishing mortality still have greater impact on the cod stock dynamics than predation by anglerfish. The annual biomass loss of anglerfish due to cannibalism was estimated to nearly 15 % of the annual loss due to natural mortality. Anglerfish in <b>Faroese</b> <b>waters</b> may be regarded as a separate stock because all life stages are found in the area, local spawning area, seasonal offshore-onshore migration on the Faroe Plateau, together with insignificant emigration/immigration (< 5 %). An age-based stock assessment of anglerfish in <b>Faroese</b> <b>waters</b> for the period 1999 – 2011 showed that the stock biomass ranged between 9000 and 19000 t with a peak in 2004 – 2005 and the fishing mortality for age 3 – 8 varied between 0. 2 and 0. 5 year- 1. The yield per recruit curve indicated that the stock was slightly growth overfished. Decreasing the fishing mortality could potentially increase the yield per recruit by around 10 % leading to a 50 % higher equilibrium biomass of anglerfish. No clear stock-recruitment relationship was found. On the other hand, anglerfish year-class strength was correlated with environmental variables, such as sandeel abundance. Hence, the rather short time series of anglerfish year-class strength provides little or no evidence of recruitment overfishing. It is recommended that stock assessments should be performed on an annual basis, allowing managers to react timely when there are signs of overfishing or recruitment failure due to natural or fishery causes...|$|E

40|$|Most {{studies of}} the genetic {{structure}} of Atlantic cod have focused on small geographical scales. In the present study, the genetic structure of cod sampled on spawning grounds in the North Atlantic was examined using eight microsatellite loci and the Pan I locus. A total of 954 cod was collected from nine different regions: the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Celtic Sea, the Irish Sea and Icelandic waters during spring 2002 and spring 2003, from Norwegian waters and the Faroe Islands (North and West spawning grounds) in spring 2003, and from Canadian waters in 1998. Temporal stability among spawning grounds was observed in Icelandic waters and the Celtic Sea, and no significant difference was observed between the samples from the Baltic Sea and between the samples from <b>Faroese</b> <b>waters.</b> F-statistics showed significant differences between most populations and a pattern of isolation-by-distance was described with microsatellite loci. The Pan I locus revealed the presence of two genetically distinguishable basins, the North-west Atlantic composed of the Icelandic and Canadian samples and the North-east Atlantic composed of all other samples. Permutation of allele sizes at each microsatellite locus among allelic states supported a mutational component to the genetic differentiation, indicating a historical origin of the observed variation.

The European Union and Norway awarded themselves 90% of the TAC in 2011, despite Icelandic and Faroese objections. Scientific investigations concluded that the TAC of mackerel should be 646,000 tons, of which the EU and Norway awarded themselves 583,882 tons, leaving only 62,118 tons for the Faroe Islands and Iceland.

40|$|The Northeast Atlantic sustains {{a number}} of pelagic fish stocks, the most {{important}} of which are Norwegian Spring Spawning (NSS) herring, Northeast Atlantic blue whiting and Northeast Atlantic mackerel. The stocks are located in Russian, Norwegian, Icelandic, <b>Faroese</b> and EU <b>waters,</b> but the large scale distribution pattern varies and is related to total stock sizes and water temperatures. All stocks are classified as straddling stocks {{in the sense that they}} not only cross boundaries between the EEZs of coastal states, but also traverse the high seas areas between those boundaries. The migratory patterns of these stocks have undoubtedly made it more difficult to attain and to uphold international agreements on catch quotas. While agreements on less migratory demersal stocks (cod and haddock, for example) between Russia and Norway have remained unchanged since the early 1980 s, the agreements on the pelagic stocks have sometimes broken down or taken long time to establis. Although the literature on straddling fish stocks is extensive, with several contributions in recent years, few studies address these issues in a multispecies context. The present work will be a step toward closing this gap by developing a framework for game theoretic analysis of such systems...|$|R
40|$|Observations from a {{large number}} of seabird line-transect surveys {{conducted}} in <b>Faroese</b> <b>waters</b> are used to derive some general conclusions regarding the distribution of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) in the region using estimates of encounter rates (no. /km- 1) in different meso-scale habitats around the Faroes during the breeding season (May-September). Based on a sub-set of the data collected during calm conditions (sea states below Beaufort 3) we analysed the distribution of harbour porpoises in relation to 5 potentially important physical parameters: water depth, distance to shore, slope of the ocean floor, distance to tidal front and Beaufort sea state. These parameters were determined from data collected during the surveys, the literature {{as well as from the}} new bathymetry established for the Faroese shelf. In order to link the differently scaled physical parameters with the encounter rates and sea states recorded during the surveys we used a suite of geo-statistical and raster-based GIS techniques based on a uniform grid resolution of 1 km in UTM zone 29 N projection. After removing parameters with insignificant effects a model of main effects was produced with sea state and distance to the tidal front having a significant negative effect on the rate of encountering harbour porpoises during both sets of cruises analysed (August 1997 and other surveys). During both sets of cruises the distance to the tidal front had a larger effect on the distribution of the animals than sea state. The strong relationship between harbour porpoise distribution and the average position of the tidal front around the Faroes strongly suggests that the species concentrates near the quasi-stationary circular shelf front separating mixed from stratified waters around the Faroes. However, the importance of shelf fronts for the distribution of harbour porpoises needs to be studied in detail in order to establish the proportionof the populations associated with these structures...|$|E

Six trawlers have licences to direct fishery of greater silver smelt. The regulation also includes limitations in e. g. bycatch, mesh size and fishing area. The EU introduced TAC management in 2003. For 2013 the EU TAC was set to 4316 tons in area V, VI, VII. For 2014 and 2016 the EU TAC was set to the same as in 2013 (V, VI, VII = 4316 tons). Most, if not all, of theEU TAC is caught in ICES Division VIa, therefore from the Vb–VIa stock unit. The fishery is smaller in other areas where the species is also discarded by various fisheries in quantities that could not be estimated. Little new data and no new assessment were presented for orange roughy in 2015. The species appears is very small amount in discards of some fleets in EU waters. There is a Faroese fishery on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. For this particularly long-lived species, the results Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) presented in 2013 re-main appropriate and do no need yearly updating. The status of the roundnose grenadier stocks are varied. Roundnose grenadier in Vb, VI, VII and XIIb is assessed using a Bayesian surplus production model since 2010. The fishing pressure in recent years is estimated low, the biomass is slowly rebuild-ing after two decades of overexploitation. No advice is required in 2015. Exploratory assessments were carried out using the abundance indices from the Marine Scotland Deepwater Science Survey instead of the usual French tallybook indices (which was also run for comparison between models). Estimated trends in stock biomass using the survey of the tallybook indices are consistent. However, the stock biomass in re-cent years is estimated to increase at a substantially higher rate when the model is fit to the survey index. The survey covers the main distribution range of thee stock and the main fishing grounds. It is therefore most likely to provide a realistic index of the stock abundance. It may further be conservative as it does not cover the fully area of distribution part of which has not been fished in recent years. WGDEEP proposed the stock for benchmarking in 2017, in order to review the use of biomass indices and investigate alternative to the current assessment model. The fishery for roundnose grenadier in Division IIIa has been stopped since 2006 and landings are now insignificant. The bycatch from other fisheries is also low. The only information to assess this stock is now a Norwegian survey index from the same area. This index has shown a declining trend since 2006 and is now at the lowest level rec-orded during the time-series from 1984. The state of roundnose grenadier stocks on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is unclear owing to limited data. This stock was intensively exploited in the 1970 s and 1980 s, the fishery declined in the 1990 s and was insignifi-cant in the 2000 s and resumed in 2011. In other areas, roundnose grenadier is only a bycatch and catch are insignificant. An assessment and advice was requested for the roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) in the Northeast Atlantic owing to landings reported in previous years. Data were compiled and a catch based advice was prepared. This species is caught and subject to TAC management in the NAFO area. In the ICES area, it occurs at a much lower level, it is however known to occur at east Greenland (Division XIVb, Iceland (Va), Faroe Islands (Vb), Northern North Sea (IVa), Norwegian and Barents Sea (I and II). The landings level reported in some previous years were not plausible as high densities are not known to occur in reported catch areas. An advice reflecting possi-ble level of sustainable catch was prepared. Similarly, an assessment and advice was requested for the roundsnout grenadier (Trachyrincus scabrus) in the Northeast Atlantic (see chapter 15). This species is con-sidered to have none or only minor commercial interest. The request for an advice came from landings reported in previous years. These landings were considered to be either minor bycatch or species misreporting. The advice is that the possible small landings of the species are counted against existing roundnose and roughhead gren-adiers TACs. The assessment of black scabbardfish was benchmarked at WKDEEP 2014. This spe-cies was formerly assessed in three units in the ICES area. Although no final conclu-sion is reached all available evidence suggest that a single stock does a large clockwise migrations in the Northeast Atlantic and further south in the CECAF areas where spawning occurs. Whether fish in Azorean waters and on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (ICES Subareas X and XII) belongs to the same widely distributed stock is un-certain and the picture in Subarea X is further blurred by the mixing with the closely related intermediate scabbardfish (Aphanopus intermedius). Greater forkbeard is caught mostly as a bycatch. Adults are a landed bycatch in slope fisheries for hake, monkfish, megrims and deep-water species and juveniles are a discarded bycatch in numerous fisheries. The assessment is based upon indices from four surveys. The increasing trend in abundance and biomass in recent years seems to be reverting. Time-series of survey indices display pluri-annual fluctuations, prob-ably related to recruitment variability. Alfonsinos are a mixture of two species (Beryx splendens and Beryx decadactylus. These species are oceanic demersal species occurring at the top of seamounts and along slopes, where they form local aggregations. They are widespread in the Northeast Atlantic from Iceland to the Azores and along the continental slope, in particular to the west of Iberia and Bay of Biscay. The stock structure is uncertain and data very limited. Although a longline survey is carried out in the Azores, where most of the catch occur, the reliably of survey indices is uncertain for these species owing to their large and patchy spatial distributions. As a consequence, the perception of the status of these stocks relies primarily on catch trends. Three stocks of blackspot sea bream are assessed by WGDEEP. In ICES Subarea IX Target fishery only take places in the Strait of Gibraltar, while the species is taken as a bycatch of artisanal fleets which uses mainly longlines. In 2014, landings and lpue from the Spanish “voracera” target fishery seemed increasing and the mean length in the catchwas slightly larger. However, the VMS-based lpue developed in recent years could not be updated and the assessment this stock is undermined by the lack of data from the Mediterranean and CECAF area as the same stockstraddles over ICES, CE-CAF and GFCM areas, where management regimes are different. Although no advice is given in 2015 for blackspot sea bream stocks, the WGDEEP report reminds that a recovery plan involving all parties is necessary for this stock. The stock of the same species in the Azores (ICES Subarea X) also showed signs of overexploitation. Ex-ploratory analyses of the natural and fishing mortalities were conducted using catch curves in order to investigate optimal exploitation reference points (yield-per-recruit analysis). Results show that modelling the fraction of population that change sex is a key issue to better estimating the trajectory of the spawning biomass. Data collection on sex ratio, maturity and sex change has been updated and analysed. Traditional models should be extended to incorporate the sex change issue. The third blackspot sea bream stock in ICES Subareas VI, VII and VIII remains at a low level, since it col-lapsed in the 1980 s. In response to a request from the NEAFC, the working group update descriptions of deep-water fisheries in the NEAFC and ICES areas by compiling data on catch/landings, fishing effort and known spawning areas and areas of local deple-tionat the finest spatial resolution possible by ICES subarea and division (Chapter 15) ...|$|E
