5|$|In 2006, in {{response}} to disastrously low agricultural harvests, Malawi began a programme of <b>fertiliser</b> subsidies, the <b>Fertiliser</b> Input Subsidy Program (FISP) that were designed to re-energise the land and boost crop production. It {{has been reported that}} this program, championed by the country's president, is radically improving Malawi's agriculture, and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to nearby countries. The FISP <b>fertiliser</b> subsidy programs ended with President Bingu wa Mutharika's death; the country quickly faced food shortages again, and farmers developed reluctance to purchase fertilisers and other agricultural inputs on the open markets that remained.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The study {{finds out}} the {{requirement}} of chemical <b>fertilisers</b> and suggests the role of organic <b>fertilisers</b> for sustainable rice production based upon projection of rice production, consumption, demand and supply of <b>fertilisers</b> for the years of 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050. The total requirement for commonly used three <b>fertilisers,</b> Urea, Triple Supper Phosphate (TSP) and Muriate of Potash (MP) may increase significantly due to compulsions for growing increased amount of crop outputs in small fragmented parcels {{of land in the}} context of diminishing cultivable lands in Bangladesh, negatively impacting on soil fertility as well as sustainability of crop production. Since sustainable yield of crop considerably depends on balanced application of both chemical and organic <b>fertilisers</b> in the field level, the research suggests for increased usage of organic <b>fertilisers...</b>|$|R
5|$|On 14 May 1943, Irish Oak was enroute from Tampa, Florida, to Dublin with a {{cargo of}} 8,000tons of {{phosphate}} <b>fertiliser.</b> Smoke from an allied convoy was visible {{ahead in the}} distance; in general Irish ships were sailing out-of-convoy at this time.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{sustainability}} of cultivating Jatropha curcas L. in rural areas in the Kinshasa region, four cropping systems were compared: cultivation of J. curcas as a sole crop with and without <b>fertilisers,</b> a combination of J. curcas with subsistence crops (maize ­ Zea mays L., the common bean ­ Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with and without <b>fertilisers.</b> The major attacks by pests (mainly Aphthona sp.) suffered by J. curcas plants in the region make it vital to conduct at least two insecticide treatments per year. Dry seed yields of J. curcas obtained in the 4 th year of cultivation amounted to 753 kg ha­ 1 when J. curcas was cultivated as a sole crop without <b>fertilisers,</b> 797 kg ha­ 1 for intercropping without <b>fertilisers,</b> 1158 kg ha­ 1 when J. curcas was cultivated as a sole crop with <b>fertilisers</b> and 1173 kg ha­ 1 for intercropping with <b>fertilisers.</b> Yields from the two annual crops were not improved by the application of mineral <b>fertilisers</b> on the J. curcas plants. They amounted {{to an average of}} 815 kg ha­ 1 for maize and 676 kg ha­ 1 for the beans. It is more profitable to cultivate J. curcas with maize and beans than to cultivate it as a sole crop. By combining crops in this way, a one­ hectare farm can earn 1102 USD ha­ 1 without <b>fertilisers</b> and 1049 USD ha­ 1 with <b>fertilisers.</b> Sustainable cultivation of J. curcas under the test conditions requires the development of efficient weed/pest control methods and improved soil fertility management, in order to minimise the use of mineral <b>fertilisers</b> as well as strong improvement of labour productivity for seed harvesting...|$|R

40|$|Applying {{nitrogen}} <b>fertilisers</b> in legume {{species has}} been subjected to scientific research due to the efficacy of these <b>fertilisers</b> on yield (symbiotic atmospheric nitrogen fixation). In general, applying high rates of nitrogen <b>fertilisers</b> on legume species does not correlate directly with green matter production because these species take the necessary nitrogen from the atmosphere. This feature is specific also to bird’s-foot-trefoil, which fixes important amounts of atmospheric nitrogen during vegetation. This paper presents the impact of the interaction between organic and mineral <b>fertilisers</b> on bird’s-foot-trefoil within a bifactorial experiment. Differences in yield at both unilateral effect of the factors and at that of the interaction of the factors are statistically ensured.

5|$|The farm {{seizures}} {{were often}} violent; by 2006 a reported sixty white farmers had been killed, {{with many of}} their employees experiencing intimidation and torture. A large number of the seized farms remained empty, while many of those redistributed to black peasant-farmers were unable to engage in production for the market because of their {{lack of access to}} <b>fertiliser.</b>|$|E
5|$|Agricultural emissions, methane from enteric {{fermentation}} and manure management {{as well as}} nitrous oxide from animal effluent and <b>fertiliser,</b> were to enter the scheme on 1 January 2015. A 'Questions and Answers' fact sheet released by Nick Smith (Minister for Climate Change Issues) stated that the delayed entry {{was due to the}} difficulties in measuring and monitoring agricultural emissions and the limited technologies available for reducing emissions in the sector.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{are raised}} {{for a wide}} variety of products, principally meat, wool, milk, and eggs, but also {{including}} tallow, isinglass and rennet. Animals are also kept for more specialised purposes, such as to produce vaccines and antiserum (containing antibodies) for medical use. Where fodder or other crops are grown alongside animals, manure can serve as a <b>fertiliser,</b> returning minerals and organic matter to the soil in a semi-closed organic system.|$|E

They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.|$|E
5|$|Many industrially {{important}} compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong {{triple bond}} in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, {{but at the}} same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and <b>fertiliser</b> nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} birds are {{economically}} important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds (poultry and game) being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested {{for use as a}} <b>fertiliser.</b> Birds prominently figure throughout human culture. About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching {{is an important part of}} the ecotourism industry.|$|E
40|$|In all {{conventional}} agricultural systems {{based on}} the application of mineral or organic <b>fertilisers,</b> their impact is assessed depending on the final product (production of green matter or of seeds) and on its quality.

40|$|Apart from mineral <b>fertilisers,</b> organic <b>fertilisers</b> act mainly via {{the soil}} C-N pool {{in order to}} provide {{available}} nitrogen to plants. This different mode of action is not reflected so far in the current IPCC N 2 O emission model. Here we propose a simple model to calculate N 2 O emissions from organic <b>fertilisers</b> and plant residues. It considers the long-term immobilisation of N within stable organic matter in the soil as well as the mineralisation of additional N from the soil pool. A first test with field data showed reliable simulations of measured N 2 O emissions. By comparing values generated by our model with values generated by the IPCC model we show that the IPCC model may overestimate emissions from organic <b>fertilisers.</b> Therefore, within LCA inventories modelling of soil borne N 2 O emissions from organic <b>fertilisers</b> and crop residues should consider the different dynamics of N via the C-N pool in the soil...|$|R
